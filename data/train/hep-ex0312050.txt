    "one of the important parameters characterizing an underground environment is the neutron flux .",
    "recently , the role of neutrons as a source of background has received more attention .",
    "estimates of the neutron flux from surrounding materials are needed for rare event searches in underground sites .",
    "highly sensitive underground neutrino experiments require precise knowledge of neutron - induced background in the detector . in direct searches for wimp",
    "dark matter neutrons are a particularly important background , because they interact with the detector in the same way wimps do .",
    "the dominant sources of neutrons at large depth underground , where the cosmic rays are reduced significantly , are the ( @xmath0,n ) reactions on light elements ( e.g. li , f , na , etc . ) and the spontaneous fission , mainly of @xmath1u .",
    "in general , at a depth of 3000@xmath2 m w.e . , where many rare event experiments are located , the flux of neutrons from activity of the experimental environment is two to three orders of magnitudes higher than the flux of neutrons from cosmic ray muons .",
    "due to its very low intensity , the neutron flux underground is not easy to measure . at the gran sasso underground laboratory",
    "the neutron flux has been measured by several groups , employing different methods of detection @xcite . to get the neutron flux from the measurements , monte carlo simulations",
    "are usually performed , because the parameters required to handle the experimental data ( detector efficiency , energy spectrum of the incoming neutrons , etc . )",
    "are usually unknown or difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "table  [ flux_measurement ] summarizes the results of the neutron flux measurements at the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "one measurement was performed in hall c by the icarus collaboration @xcite , while all others were performed in hall a of the laboratory .",
    "most of the measurement results are given as the integral flux in a large energy bin .",
    "although different energy binning was used in these measurements , one can see that the results vary rather widely .",
    "only two measurements @xcite give some information on the spectral shape .",
    "however , for some purposes a more detailed spectrum is needed .",
    "the total flux of @xcite is basically consistent with the result of @xcite for @xmath3 mev , while the energy spectrum as a whole is significantly harder .",
    "the results from @xcite show important distortions with respect to the spectrum that was previously generally assumed in literature , i.e. a spectrum produced mainly by spontaneous fission .",
    "the difference is seen at high energies . to search for a possible explanation the authors of @xcite considered the production of neutrons via ( @xmath0,n ) reactions inside the rock and computed the ` thin target ' spectrum of neutrons produced by the reaction @xmath4o(@xmath0,n)@xmath5ne only .",
    "the ( @xmath0,n ) and spontaneous fission spectra were then used as input for the mcnp ( monte carlo n - particles ) code to obtain the effective neutron flux in hall c. they found that their measurements and simulations are in very good agreement and that ( @xmath0,n ) reactions are the main source of the high energy neutron flux in the laboratory .",
    "however , according to @xcite the uncertainties quoted in @xcite have been underestimated .",
    "they should be multiplied by @xmath6 to get the proper uncertainties , due to the fact that the background run in this experiment is about three times shorter than the data run .",
    "then all data points shown in @xcite would be insignificant and the agreement between the thin target calculation and the measurement found here would be merely accidental .    based on monte carlo simulations ,",
    "this work is devoted to reinvestigate the neutron flux from ( @xmath0,n ) and fission reactions in the rock and concrete of the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "the results offer an independent check to the present experimental data and give detailed information on the shape of the spectrum .",
    "gran sasso rock consists mainly of caco@xmath7 and mgco@xmath7 , with a density of 2.71@xmath8 g/@xmath9 @xcite . the weight percentage of the elements is given in table  [ rock ] .",
    "due to the presence of a certain type of rock , called",
    " roccia marnosa nera \" , the contaminations of @xmath1u and @xmath10th in hall a rock are about ten and thirty times higher respectively than those of hall c @xcite as shown in table  [ activity1 ] .",
    "since there are no data on the chemical composition of gran sasso concrete available in literature , several samples were taken from different places in the laboratory .",
    "the concrete samples were then analyzed at the laboratory of the _ lehrstuhl fr baustoffkunde und werkstoffprfung _ at the department of civil engineering of the technische universitt mnchen .",
    "no significant variations were found in the chemical composition of the samples , which leads to the conclusion that all halls in gran sasso are layered with the same type of concrete .",
    "the typical water content in the concrete is 12% , with a possible variation of 4% at most ( in most cases the variation is smaller ) .",
    "the weight percentage of elements in concrete with 8% water content ( hereafter  dry concrete \" ) is shown in table  [ concrete ] .",
    "the @xmath1u and @xmath10th contaminations are @xmath11 ppm and @xmath12 ppm",
    "@xcite respectively .",
    "the density is between 2.3 and 2.5 g/@xmath9 , depending on the assumed water content .",
    "there are mainly three nuclides in nature that undergo spontaneous fission : @xmath1u , @xmath13u and @xmath10th .",
    "only neutrons produced by spontaneous fission of @xmath1u are considered here , because of the long fission half life of the other two nuclides compared to that of @xmath1u .",
    "the spectrum of the emitted neutrons follows the watt spectrum : @xmath14    in this work the watt spectrum parameters of the los alamos model results @xcite have been used , where @xmath15mev and @xmath16mev@xmath17 .",
    "the rate of spontaneous fission of @xmath1u is 0.218/year / g of rock ( concrete ) for 1ppm of @xmath1u and the average number of neutrons emitted per fission event is 2.4@xmath180.2 @xcite .",
    "this gives 0.52 neutrons / year / g of rock ( concrete)/ppm @xmath1u .",
    "this number multiplied by the @xmath1u activities in the rock / concrete would give 3.54 , 0.22 and 0.34 neutrons / year / g in the rock of hall a , b and c respectively and 0.55 neutrons / year / g in the concrete . figure  [ fission ] shows the neutron energy distribution due to spontaneous fission of @xmath1u .",
    "uranium , thorium , and their daughter products decay by emitting @xmath0 and @xmath19 particles . in the rock ( concrete )",
    "@xmath0-particles can interact especially with light elements and produce neutrons through ( @xmath0,n ) reactions .",
    "the yield of neutrons per @xmath0-particle for an individual element depends on the ( @xmath0,n ) interaction cross section ( which is energy dependent ) , and on the energy loss of @xmath0-particles in a medium made of that element . in this work",
    "the thick target yield of ( @xmath0,n ) reactions was used instead of the thin target yield used in @xcite .",
    "the thick target yield of the ( @xmath0,n ) reaction for an individual element _ j _ in which the @xmath0-particle has a range @xmath20 can be written as @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of atoms per unit volume of element @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the microscopic ( @xmath0,n ) reaction cross section for an @xmath0-particle energy @xmath25 . transforming the right side of eq .",
    "[ eq : thick_yield ] into an integral over energy gives : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the initial @xmath0-energy , @xmath28 is avogadro s number , @xmath29 is the atomic mass and @xmath24 and @xmath30 are the ( @xmath0,n ) cross section and the mass stopping power respectively , which are energy dependent .",
    "neutron yields from individual elements can be used to calculate the total yield in a chemical compound or mixture @xcite .",
    "the following assumptions are usually made in such a calculation :       the compound is a homogeneous mixture of its constituent elements     bragg s law of additivity for stopping power holds for the compound     the ratio of an element s stopping power to the total stopping power of the compound is independent of the @xmath0-particle energy .",
    "the validity of ( iii ) has been discussed by several authors .",
    "although for each element the mass stopping power @xmath31 decreases with energy , feige @xcite found that the mass stopping power ratio for any pair of elements does not change by more than @xmath324% between 5.3 mev and 8.8 mev .",
    "@xcite showed that above 3 mev this approximation introduces an uncertainty of less than 5% in the neutron yield .    under those assumptions the neutron yield of element _ j _ in the compound or mixture with initial @xmath0-particle energy @xmath27 can be written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass fraction of element _ j _ in the mixture , @xmath35 is a chosen reference energy ( 8 mev in this work ) , @xmath31 is the mass stoping power and @xmath36 is the neutron yield of element _ j _ in isolation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : yield_isolation ] ) ) .",
    "thus the ( @xmath0,n ) yield of a compound ( mixture ) is the sum of the yields of its elements weighted by the relative contributions of the elements to the total stopping power of the compound .",
    "the use of 8 mev mass stopping power was selected because the overwhelming contribution to the neutron yield comes from high energy @xmath0-particles and the relative stopping power of elements are nearly independent of the @xmath0-energy in this energy region @xcite .",
    "the mass stopping powers at 8 mev of elements used in this work are as those used in @xcite . in this work the data on neutron yield of elements in isolation , in units of neutron/@xmath0 ,",
    "is taken from a compilation by heaton et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "each @xmath0 emitter in the @xmath1u and @xmath10th decay chains emits @xmath0 s at a certain energy , which was used as the initial energy in the neutron yield calculation .",
    "the neutron yield of each element with certain initial energy was then multiplied by the branching ratio , the number of @xmath0 s emitted by each emitter per unit time , and the concentration of @xmath1u and @xmath10th in the rock ( concrete ) .",
    "it is assumed in this work , that @xmath1u and @xmath10th are in secular equilibrium with their daughter products .",
    "the total neutron production rate for each element was calculated by summing up the contribution of all alpha emitters .    in table",
    "[ hallyield ] and table  [ concyield ] neutrons produced per unit mass per year by ( @xmath0,n ) reactions with the elements of the rock in hall a , hall c and also in dry concrete are presented .",
    "it is seen that fission ( see discussion in the previous section ) and ( @xmath0,n ) reactions contribute more or less equally to the total production rates both in the rock and in the concrete .",
    "half of the total ( @xmath0,n ) neutron production in the rock comes from interactions of @xmath0 particles with magnesium , which comprises only less than 6% of the weight percentage of the rock , whereas oxygen with almost 50% weight percentage contributes to only about 20% of the production rate . due to the higher activity of the hall a rock",
    "the ( @xmath0,n ) neutron production in the rock of this hall is more than ten times higher than in the hall c rock . in the concrete",
    "na , al and mg contribute significantly in spite of their minor weight percentages .",
    "the production rate per unit mass in the wet concrete ( 16% water content ) is slightly smaller than in the dry concrete , but this is merely due to the difference in the densities . the volume of concrete remains , while the mass changes with the water content . given per unit volume the production rates in dry and wet concrete are the same .",
    "the energy of the emitted neutron is dependent on the @xmath0 energy , the reaction energy @xmath37 , and the neutron emission angle .",
    "it was calculated under the following assumptions :       the interaction take place at the initial @xmath0 energy     the neutron is emitted at @xmath38     the residual nucleus is produced in its ground state .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the neutron energy can be determined by using the simple eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the mass of the final nucleus , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the masses of neutron and the @xmath0 particle respectively , and @xmath43 is the initial @xmath0 energy .    the threshold energy @xmath44 for an ( @xmath0,n ) reaction is the minimum kinetic energy the impinging @xmath0 particle must have ( in the laboratory system ) in order to make the reaction energetically possible . for endothermic reactions , the threshold energy is : @xmath45q\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the masses of the target nucleus and of @xmath0 particle respectively .",
    "the threshold energy is zero for exothermic reactions , i.e. reactions with positive @xmath37 .",
    "the highest energy among naturally emitted relevant @xmath0 particles is 8.79 mev , which comes from the decay of @xmath48po .",
    "hence , for some elements in the rock / concrete there are isotopes that can not participate in the ( @xmath0,n ) reactions because of their high @xmath44 ( e.g. @xmath49o , @xmath50si , @xmath51 mg , and @xmath52ca ) . for each element calculations of neutron energies",
    "were therefore done for all isotopes that are not closed for @xmath53,n ) interactions .",
    "then , neutron mean energies of elements were calculated according to the relative abundances of the ",
    "open \" isotopes for different @xmath0 energies .",
    "finally , the yields of all elements were summed up in 0.5mev energy bins to get the energy spectra of neutrons from @xmath53,n ) reactions as shown in figure  [ plotconc ] for hall a rock , hall c rock , and dry concrete .",
    "while neutrons below 4mev are mainly produced by spontaneous fission , ( @xmath0,n ) reaction is the main contributor in the production of neutrons with higher energy .",
    "neutrons with energy above 6mev are contributions of magnesium and carbon .",
    "to get the flux of low energy neutrons inside the halls , the monte carlo code mcnp4b ( monte carlo n - particles version 4b ) from los alamos @xcite was used to transport neutrons produced by fission and @xmath53,n ) reactions as calculated above through the rock and concrete and scatter them inside the halls .",
    "table  [ typ_depth ] summarizes the typical depths of neutrons ( the depths where @xmath54 63% of neutrons come from , the @xmath55 length ) produced in hall a rock and in dry concrete , and entering hall a ( before scattering inside the hall ) with any energy and in addition with energy @xmath56 mev .",
    "neutrons with @xmath56 mev come mainly from the first 7 cm and 13 cm of concrete and rock respectively .",
    "as the thickness of the concrete layer at the gran sasso laboratory is not less than 30 cm ( in some places even around 1 m ) , the bulk of the total flux at the laboratory is given by neutrons produced in the concrete .",
    "in the further simulations performed to get the neutron flux inside the halls , the thickness of the concrete layer in the laboratory has been set to 45 cm below the floor and 35 cm elsewhere , and 2 m of rock have been taken into account .",
    "the calculated fluxes of neutrons ( after scattering inside the halls ) are shown in table  [ nflux_calcu ] for hall a with 8% ( dry ) and 16% ( wet ) water content in the concrete and for hall c with dry concrete , together with the measurement in hall a by belli et al .",
    "@xcite as a comparison . the measured flux between @xmath57mev is taken from @xcite .",
    "we calculated the errors in this energy bin by assuming that the relative errors in 1kev@xmath581mev and @xmath59mev bins are equal .",
    "uncertainties in the neutron flux in our calculations can be attributed to the uncertainties in the neutron production rate from ( @xmath0,n)/fission reactions and the energies of the emitted neutrons .",
    "+ the major sources of uncertainty in the total ( @xmath0,n ) neutron yield of the rock and concrete are the uncertainties in the stopping powers , elemental neutron yield per @xmath0 particle and material compositions .",
    "we adopt the 5% uncertainty in the stopping power data as stated in @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the ratio of an element s stopping power to the total stopping power of the compound is independent of the @xmath0-particle energy introduces another uncertainty of about 5% in the neutron yield ( see subsection 2.3 ) .",
    "the deviation from bragg s rule , which was observed in compounds in gaseous phase and hydrocarbons , does not produce significant contribution to the uncertainty of the neutron yield calculation ( see @xcite and references therein ) . an additional 5% uncertainty coming from the heaton s compilation of elemental neutron yield per @xmath0 above 3.7 mev @xcite",
    "is taken into account .",
    "for the determination of the material composition we assume an uncertainty of 1 - 2% , as is common using modern analytical instruments . combining these uncertainties in quadrature ,",
    "the uncertainty of the ( @xmath0,n ) yield from a compound is roughly 9% .",
    "the major uncertainty in the fission neutron yield of about 8% is due to uncertainty in the average number of neutrons emitted per fission @xcite .",
    "the total number of neutrons produced by fission and ( @xmath0,n ) in the rock / concrete at the gran sasso laboratory depends eventually on the @xmath1u and @xmath10th contamination . taking into account the uncertainties in the activities and the aforementioned uncertainties in the neutron yield would give an over all uncertainties of about 15% and 20% in the total neutron fluxes in hall a and hall c respectively , due to uncertainties in the neutron production from ( @xmath0,n)/fission reactions .    jacobs and liskien",
    "@xcite reported energy spectra of neutrons produced by @xmath0-particles with energies of 4 , 4.5 , 5 and 5.5 mev in thick targets of light elements ( all elements important for us are available here , except na ) .",
    "the difference between our calculation of the energies of emitted neutrons and the average energies in @xcite are generally less than 0.5 mev . only for mg a difference of 1.5 mev",
    "is found . to estimate the uncertainty in the neutron flux due to our assumptions in determining the energies of the emitted neutrons ( see subsection 2.3 and figure  [ plotconc ] ) we have repeated the simulations of neutron propagation , using the average neutron energies reported in @xcite where available . for @xmath0-energies above 5.5 mev",
    "we reduced our calculated emitted neutron energies by 0.5 mev ( 1.5 mev for mg ) . for elements which are not available from @xcite we reduced the energies of emitted neutrons by 0.5 mev for all @xmath0-energies . for the spontaneous fission of @xmath1u",
    "no modification is needed since the spectrum is well understood .",
    "we find that the total neutron fluxes at the hall a and c change by about 10% due to these alterations , and also the spectral shape changes . combining this uncertainty with the aforementioned uncertainties in the neutron production",
    ", we estimate the over all systematic uncertainty of the total flux to be around 20% ( slightly higher for hall c ) .",
    "energy dependent uncertainties are reported in table  [ nflux_calcu ] .    the total flux and the integral flux above 1mev in hall a are consistent with those of the measurement @xcite if the concrete in hall a is dry .",
    "the simulated flux differs from the measured one in the chosen bins below 1mev . in our simulations",
    "we have assumed that there is nothing inside the hall and neutrons can only be scattered by the walls . in reality as in the measurement , neutrons coming from the rock / concrete can be scattered by anything inside the hall before they eventually come into the experimental setup .",
    "those neutrons are moderated , raising the flux in the lowest energy bin .    within the estimated uncertainties the total flux in hall c is only slightly less than in hall",
    "a for the case of dry concrete , although the neutron production rate in hall c rock is more than ten times lower than that of hall a ; above 1mev the fluxes in the two halls are in agreement .",
    "this is due to the concrete , which indeed reduces the neutron flux from the rock significantly so that neutrons coming into the halls are mainly those produced in the concrete layer .",
    "table  [ nflux_calcu ] shows that the neutron flux depends on the humidity of the environment .",
    "the flux in hall a is lower if the concrete is wet than if it is dry ( 8% and 16% water content respectively ) .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the 8% difference in the water content of concrete does not lead to different neutron production rates .",
    "the effect seen in the flux here is caused only by moderation .",
    "wet concrete moderates neutrons more effectively than dry concrete due its higher hydrogen content .",
    "the fluxes obtained for dry and wet concrete here show the maximum possible variation for the water content of concrete . a more realistic variation of the water content of ( @xmath60)% results consequently in smaller flux variation .",
    "to quantify this effect and to see whether it is a seasonal phenomenon , it is necessary to monitor the water content of the concrete for at least one year .",
    "detailed spectra of neutrons in hall a and hall c are shown in figure  [ compare_spectrum ] for neutron energy above 0.5mev .",
    "each point shows the integral flux in a 0.5 mev energy bin .",
    "the contribution of ( @xmath0,n ) makes the spectra in both halls differ from the spectrum expected for neutrons produced by fission reactions only , as was previously generally assumed , especially at high energies .",
    "we have discussed the flux of neutrons induced by radioactivity in the rock and concrete surrounding the gran sasso laboratory . the flux is dominated by neutrons produced in the concrete layer and therefore does not vary much from hall to hall .",
    "it can be expected that as well for other underground laboratories the neutron flux originates mainly from the concrete and not from the rock material .",
    "a more detailed spectrum compared to that from measurements has been obtained .",
    "the spectrum differs from the spectrum expected for neutrons produced by fission reactions only , especially at high energies , due to the contribution of ( @xmath0,n ) neutrons .",
