    "magnetoelectric multiferroics , i.e. materials hosting both ferroelectric and ( ferro)magnetic orders , attracted enormous interest due to their potential in information technology applications.@xcite the magnetoelectric effect emerges not only in the static limit but also in the optical regime , as it is manifested in the difference between the refractive indices of counter - propagating light beams.@xcite indeed , strong directional dichroism , i.e. different absorption coefficient for light beams travelling in opposite directions , has been reported for spin excitations in multiferroics and was proposed as a new principle of directional light switch operating in the ghz - thz range.@xcite    recently a new family of magnetoelectric multiferroic crystals , @xmath3fe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 rare - earth ferroborates , attracted much attention from the scientific community .",
    "their uniqe crystal structure possessing magnetic iron and rare - earth sites @xmath4 in a chiral arrangement allows the investigation of a wide variety of exotic magnetic and magnetoelectric phenomena.@xcite    the fe@xmath5 ions are surrounded by edge - sharing o@xmath6 octahedra and form quasi one - dimensional helical chains along the trigonal @xmath7 axis of the crystal.@xcite these helices are expected to be only weakly connected by the fe - o - o - fe superexchange paths.@xcite thus the magnetic interaction between the iron chains and the rare - earth ions located between the iron helices plays an important role in tuning the effective dimensionality of the magnetic system .",
    "the single - ion anisotropy of the rare earth spins is transmitted to the otherwise nearly - isotropic fe spins via @xmath8 exchange interactions.@xcite the dominant magnetic interaction is the @xmath9 exchange coupling between fe spins , which leads to an antiferromagnetic ordering of the fe subsystem .",
    "the rare earth spins  largely separated from each other  remain paramagnetic and are only polarized by the ordered fe moments.@xcite    the strong spin - orbit coupling of the rare - earth ions plays a key role in the multiferroicity of these materials , i.e. their magneto - electric response is dominated by the rare - earth sites.@xcite correspondingly , the magnetoelectric properties of rare - earth ferroborates can be efficiently tuned by the selection of different rare earth elements characterized by different magnetic anisotropies .",
    "tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 is a particularly interesting member of the rare - earth ferroborate family . due to the effect of the strong crystal field",
    ", the ground - state doublet of tb@xmath5 ion is separated from the excited states by a considerable energy gap of @xmath10.@xcite thus at low temperatures the @xmath11 spin of the tb@xmath5 ion behaves like an ising moment pointing along the trigonal @xmath7 axis of the crystal . as in the sister compounds @xmath3=pr ( ref . [ ] ) and @xmath3=dy ( ref . [ ] ) , in tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 the easy - axis anisotropy of the rare - earth ion is transmitted to the antiferromagnetic @xmath12 iron system .",
    "consequently , tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 shows a collinear antiferromagnetic order below @xmath13 with all spins lying along the @xmath7 axis.@xcite        magnetic field along the @xmath7 axis induces spin flop transition and all the tb moments become parallel to the field while the sublattice magnetization of the antiferromagnetic fe subsystem rotates to the @xmath14 plane and a weak canting develops along the @xmath7 axis .",
    "the spin - flop transition field is @xmath15 at @xmath16 and increases with increasing temperature.@xcite the magnetic order of tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 was widely investigated by both magnetization and elastic neutron scattering experiments.@xcite the temperature and field dependent behavior of the static magnetization was reproduced by former mean - field calculations@xcite .",
    "however , the collective magnetic excitations of the ground state were only studied in zero magnetic field via optical spectroscopy.@xcite    here we investigate the low - energy magnetic excitations of tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 using far - infrared optical spectroscopy up to high magnetic fields applied along and perpendicular to the trigonal @xmath7 axis .",
    "the observed field dependence of the resonance frequencies and the magnetization are reproduced by a mean - field spin model .",
    "in contrast to earlier studies in our model we allow a small canting of the quasi - ising tb moments and a tb - fe exchange interaction is introduced for ions located in the same @xmath14 plane to achieve a quantitative agreement with the static and dynamic magnetic properties .",
    "fourier transform spectroscopy was used to study the optical absorption and reflection of tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 in the @xmath17 frequency range with 8 ghz resolution .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the spectra in the @xmath18 magnetic field range was investigated using the teslafir setup of the national institute of chemical physics and biophysics in tallinn.@xcite optical absorption experiments up to 30 t were carried out in the high field magnet laboratory in nijmegen ( hfml ) .",
    "the spectra were measured in the faraday configuration , i.e. in magnetic fields parallel to the direction of light propagation , using oriented single crystal samples with a typical thicknesses of 1 mm .",
    "the crystals were grown by a flux method.@xcite",
    "in figs . [ expfig](a)-(c ) , the optical absorption spectrum measured at @xmath16 and in @xmath19 shows a clear resonance at @xmath20 .",
    "though this resonance has already been observed and assigned as an antiferromagnetic resonance of the fe system,@xcite its field dependence has not been investigated so far .    in magnetic fields",
    "@xmath21 parallel to the @xmath7 axis the @xmath22 resonance shows a v - shape splitting to @xmath23 and @xmath24 modes , as shown in figs . [ expfig](a ) and [ expfig](c ) . above @xmath25 these resonances are replaced by a single mode , @xmath26 , which hardens linearly with increasing field .",
    "these resonances are also visible in the field dependence of the reflectivity spectra whose inverse line shape ( dip in the reflectivity ) as opposed to dielectric resonances supports their magnetic nature",
    ".    two further resonances with field independent @xmath27 and @xmath28 frequencies , best visible in fig . [ expfig](a ) , also appear in the spin - flop phase . despite their constant frequency",
    ", their oscillator strength grows with increasing field , indicating the magnetic origin of these modes . besides these pronounced resonances some weaker ones",
    "can also be observed in the low - field phase , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ expfig](a ) .",
    "these resonance lines start at @xmath29 and @xmath30 frequencies in @xmath19 and also show a v - shape splitting with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the splitting has the same slope as for the @xmath20 mode .",
    "the weak @xmath31 and @xmath32 resonances , and the field independent @xmath33 and @xmath34 modes are not visible in the reflectivity spectra of fig .",
    "[ expfig](c ) .",
    "the absorption coefficient of magnetic excitations is the same for light propagation parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field within the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "it means that despite the chiral crystal structure , the homochiral sample does not show considerable magneto - chiral dichroism ( mchd ) in the studied frequency window.@xcite static studies revealed that the magnetoelectric effect is mainly associated with tb sites in tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1.@xcite since static and dynamic magnetoelectric effects are closely related by a sum rule @xcite and the latters are responsible for the directional dichroism in the thz spectral range , the absence of mchd suggests that the observed excitations are of purely magnetic origin , and belong to the fe subsystem .",
    "this is in accordance with the strong ising character of the tb moments , which act on the fe spins as a static internal magnetic field but otherwise do not contribute to the spin dynamics .",
    "in contrast , a recent study@xcite found strong directional dichroism in the easy plane antiferromagnet sm@xmath35la@xmath35fe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 , which originates from the coupled dynamics of the rare - earth sites with magnetoelectric character and the fe spins .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ expfig](b ) , the @xmath22 resonance exhibits a quadratic shift towards higher frequencies with increasing magnetic field applied perpendicular to the @xmath7 axis , as expected for an easy axis antiferromagnet .",
    "the other excitation discernible in this configuration is the @xmath31 mode , whose frequency is nearly frequency independent in the range @xmath36 although it gains oscillator strength with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath22 resonance frequency in zero field shows the behavior expected for an anisotropic antiferromagnet , namely it gets softer and broader as the temperature approaches @xmath13 .",
    "our results measured in transmission and reflection geometries are in good agreement with the previous study of a. m. kuzmenko et al.,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ compfig](c ) .          here",
    "we propose a classical mean - field model , which captures the magnetic field dependence of the ground state and that of the strong magnetic modes .",
    "we model the fe and tb moments , two sublattices for each , as classical vectors with different lengths , @xmath37 for fe ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 for tb moments ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "the energy of a single magnetic unit cell can be written as :    @xmath43    we include a strong negative uniaxial single - ion anisotropy term @xmath44 for the tb sites to model their ising - like nature . in case of the terms describing the exchange energy contributions ,",
    "numeric prefactors correspond to the coordination numbers .",
    "an isotropic negative @xmath9 exchange term connecting the fe sublattices is responsible for the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "it is reasonable to consider the magnetic anisotropy of the rare - earth system only since in non - magnetic ( yfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 ) and magnetically isotropic ( gdfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 ) members of the crystal family the fe spin system is nearly isotropic heisenberg - like.@xcite the tb and fe moments are coupled by the @xmath45 and @xmath46 exchange terms , where the dominant @xmath45 connects moments on adjacent @xmath14 layers and the weaker @xmath46 links ions on the same @xmath14 layers .",
    "this kind of coupling was neglected so far,@xcite since the possible superexchange path corresponding to @xmath46 is quite long .",
    "the last two terms of eq . [ model ] describe the zeeman energy , where @xmath47 is the external magnetic field .",
    "approximate values for the parameters in eq .",
    "[ model ] can be deducted from the static magnetization data and can be further tuned to fit the lowest excitation frequencies of the system . for the first estimation of the exchange and anisotropy constants we use the land values @xmath48 and @xmath49 given for the free ions , which could be modified by crystal - field effects .",
    "the slope of the magnetization in @xmath50 magnetic field parallel to the @xmath7 axis is governed by the susceptibility of the fe subsystem , because in the spin flop phase all the tb moments point along the magnetic field and do not contribute to the susceptibility .",
    "the susceptibility per formula unit @xmath51 is determined by the @xmath9 exchange , hence @xmath52.@xcite this value of @xmath9 is in good agreement with most of the previous studies ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55).@xcite    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ partabl ]    at the spin - flop transition the @xmath42 moments occuping one half of the tb sites flip from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , giving rise to a @xmath58 jump in the magnetization per formula unit .",
    "in addition , the fe moments show some canting in the spin - flop phase which also gives a minor contribution to the jump of the magnetization .",
    "the spin - flop transition takes place when the energy of the collinear and spin flop phases are equal , resulting in an approximate expression for the tb - fe coupling : @xmath59 where we neglected higher order terms in @xmath60 . due to the different exchange paths @xmath61",
    "is expected to be much smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "correspondingly all of the previous studies neglected the contribution of @xmath46 and attributed the whole tb - fe coupling to the @xmath45 exchange.@xcite on the other hand , static magnetization data are not sufficient to unambiguously determine both @xmath45 and @xmath46 , thus , in this section we assume @xmath63 following previous works .",
    "the effective field along the @xmath7 axis acting on the antiferromagnetic fe system can be approximated by the sum of the external field and the effective field of the tb moments . since in the spin - flop phase both of the tb sublattices are in the @xmath64 state , their effective field on the fe site is @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the @xmath66 magnetization jump@xcite at the spin - flop transition is    @xmath67    giving rise to a refined value of @xmath68 which is significantly lower than the @xmath49 land value .",
    "neutron scattering studies@xcite reported @xmath69 ordered tb moment at @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath70 , which is in good accordance with our analysis .",
    "[ j ] the strength of the tb - fe exchange can be determined , @xmath71 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the @xmath72 and @xmath73 values of previous magnetization studies.@xcite the same coupling constant was determined from the splitting of the ground quasi - doublet of the tb ions , which was observed as a splitting of the infrared transitions , corresponding to @xmath74.@xcite    for fields perpendicular to the @xmath7 axis , the susceptibility of the system is @xmath75 , which is about @xmath76 larger than @xmath77.@xcite as the fe system is expected to be isotropic , the anisotropy of the susceptibility indicates the small canting of the tb moments and thus can be used to estimate the anisotropy of the tb sites : @xmath78 ( upper and lower error bounds are indicated by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively ) .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath44 comes from the variation of the experimental values for @xmath81 and @xmath77",
    ". however , due to the length of the tb moments , @xmath82 gives the dominant energy scale of the system in the studied magnetic field range .",
    "this justifies the approximation that tb moments behave almost like ising spins .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath44 correspond to the range of the lowest excited crystal field energy levels calculated for the @xmath83 ion.@xcite    the model parameter set obtained above is presented in the first row of table [ partabl ] , which reproduces the static magnetization data . however , the static magnetization data only supports a rough estimation of the model parameters .",
    "moreover , in the former expressions only one combination of the two types of tb - fe coupling appears , namely @xmath84 , and therefore in studies based on the magnetization data the minor @xmath46 was simply neglected.@xcite in contrast , the magnetic field dependence of the dominant low - frequency magnetic excitations allows us to separate @xmath45 and @xmath46 and refine the values of all parameters in the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ model ] .      assuming ising - like tb moments @xmath85 , the zero temperature resonance frequencies of the fe system can be calculated@xcite using the @xmath11 and @xmath12 values :    @xmath86    using eq .",
    "[ omega1 ] , the @xmath9 fe - fe exchange can be determined with higher accuracy than our previous estimation from the @xmath77 magnetic susceptibility .",
    "based on the experimental @xmath87 frequency value we get @xmath88 .    in the spin flop phase at @xmath89 the effective magnetic field acting on the antiferromagnetic fe system",
    "is @xmath90 , giving information about the sum of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , thus can be used to unambiguously determine @xmath46 .",
    "the experimental value of the @xmath26 resonance frequency in the flop phase can be extrapolated to @xmath91 , corresponding to an effective field of @xmath92 .",
    "this results in @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and refines the tb @xmath2-factor to @xmath95 according to eq .",
    "[ m_egzact ] .",
    "the @xmath46 exchange is indeed weaker than @xmath45 but does not have a ferromagnetic character , in contrast to former expectations based on the crystal and magnetic structure.@xcite thus , in the zero - field ground state the bond corresponding to @xmath46 is frustrated .    according to eqs .",
    "[ omega1ab ] and [ omega1c ] , the slope of the @xmath96 and @xmath26 modes yields the @xmath2-factor of the fe system , which within the error of the measurement is equal to the spin - only @xmath97 value . using eq .",
    "[ omega1plane ] to fit the resonance frequencies measured in the @xmath98 case we get the same @xmath2-factor , thus the spin - only fe @xmath2-factor is isotropic , as expected .    when considering the finite temperature excitations of the system , in the zero field case eq .",
    "[ omega1 ] remains valid , only the temperature dependence of the lengths of the @xmath99 and @xmath100 ordered moments needs to be to be taken into account .",
    "however , a mean - field model like eq . [ model ] is not able to properly describe the temperature dependence of the magnetic properties due to neglected thermal fluctuations , thus for a quantitative description additional experimental input is needed . in the elastic neutron scattering studies@xcite",
    "the lengths of the @xmath99 and @xmath100 ordered moments were reported in the whole temperature range of the antiferromagnetic phase . by substituting these temperature dependent ordered moments into eq .",
    "[ omega1 ] the temperature dependence of the zero field resonance can be well reproduced with @xmath48 , @xmath101 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ compfig](c ) .",
    "earlier backward - wave oscillator spectroscopy studies@xcite reported the same temperature dependence .    for finite values of the tb single - ion anisotropy @xmath44 , the analytical solution corresponding to eqs .",
    "[ omega1]-[omega1plane ] is too complicated .",
    "thus we calculated the field dependence of the zero temperature resonances numerically .",
    "we used a classical monte carlo approach to find the minimal energy configuration of the four - spin system , and determined the resonances by calculating the response to small perturbations .",
    "the tb single - ion anisotropy was set to @xmath102 and the other exchange parameters used in the simulation are listed in the second row of table [ partabl ] .",
    "the calculated field dependence of the magnetization and antiferromagnetic resonance frequencies reproduce the experimental curves , as shown in fig .",
    "[ compfig](a ) and [ compfig](b ) . with finite @xmath44",

    "their presence shows that the fe sites are crystallographically not equivalent , as is expected for the low temperature @xmath104 space group@xcite of tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 .",
    "thus the proper description of the magnetic resonances is possible only with six magnetic fe sublattices which are connected by the various , non - equivalent fe - o - fe intrachain and fe - o - b - o - fe interchain superexchange paths .",
    "distinction between intrachain and interchain coupling would allow the tuning of the dimensionality of the system , thus the monte carlo approach could probably also reproduce the magnetic properties and resonance frequencies at finite temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , due to the weak structural distortion from the room - temperature @xmath105 structure to the low temperature @xmath104 , the magnetic properties can be approximated by assuming crystallographically equivalent fe sites .",
    "in this study we have investigated the low frequency magnetic excitations of the multiferroic tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 using far - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "we developed a classical mean - field spin model which quantitatively describes the main features in field dependence of the magnetization data@xcite and that of the resonance frequencies with a minimal set of magnetic interactions including exchange couplings and single - ion anisotropy .",
    "our far - infrared experiments also pointed out that the magnetic structure of tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 is more complicated than previously expected .",
    "there are six inequivalent magnetic fe sublattices , thus a more detailed neutron diffraction study is necessary to clarify the real magnetic ground state .",

    "<S> low - energy magnetic excitations of the easy - axis antiferromagnet tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 are investigated by far - infrared absorption and reflection spectroscopy in high magnetic fields up to 30 t. the observed field dependence of the resonance frequencies and the magnetization are reproduced by a mean - field spin model for magnetic fields applied both along and perpendicular to the easy axis . </S>",
    "<S> based on this model we determined the full set of magnetic interactions , including fe - fe and fe - tb exchange interactions , single - ion anisotropy for tb ions and @xmath2-factors , which describe the ground - state spin texture and the low - energy spin excitations of tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 . compared to earlier studies we allow a small canting of the nearly ising - like tb moments to achieve a quantitative agreement with the magnetic susceptibility measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the additional high energy magnetic resonance lines observed , besides the two resonances expected for a two - sublattice antiferromagnet , suggest a more complex six - sublattice magnetic ground state for tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 . </S>"
