    "we generate the field from a monopole loop , i.e. the dual analog of the wilson loop .",
    "hence we will digress to define the monopoles on the lattice using the degrand - toussaint@xcite construction .",

    "consider a configuration in which all link angles on this cube are small compared to @xmath36 .",

    "we can clearly choose the configuration that leaves the plaquette angles on all the other faces safely away from a discontinuity .",
    "we then define a dirac string @xmath43 passing through this face ( or better a dirac sheet since the lattice is 4d ) .",
    "@xmath41 measures the electromagnetic flux through the face .",
    "the important points are the following :    * the volume shown contains a magnetic monopole as indicated by a net flux of @xmath44 .",
    "* note that if one does a gauge transformation e.g. at the point @xmath45 then if one of the affected links picks up a discontinuity of @xmath46 , the two contiguous plaquettes will be affected but the flux out of the volume is unchanged . the monopole is a gauge invariant construction .",
    "* this example created a monopole - antimonopole pair in the two space cubes separated by a lattice spacing in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "the same holds in the @xmath31 direction ( not shown in fig.[fdt ] ) . * in the dual description , cubes in the original lattice are represented by links on the dual lattice orthogonal to the 3-volume . *",
    "hence for @xmath48 , ( a dirac sheet threading the plaquette ) a closed @xmath49 monopole loop has been created on the dual lattice in the @xmath50 plane forming the boundary of a dirac sheet . *",

    "we accept configurations with dirac sheets with no accompanying monopoles .",

    "we should introduce external sources and observe how they couple to the fields .",
    "equation ( [ deltap ] ) naively looks like a free field theory , except that the variables are integer valued and this indeed makes it an interacting theory .",
    "one can trace the integer value to the fact that the link angles @xmath126 are compact and hence their fourier transform is a discrete variable .",
    "but this compactness is also responsible for the existence of monopoles .",
    "our immediate concern in this paper is to show that this interacting theory given by eqn.([deltap ] ) is in fact a dual lattice higgs model@xcite .",
    "it is interesting how this comes about and gives us some insight into the significance of an integer valued dual gauge field .",
    "following references@xcite we introduce a non - compact 1-form gauge field @xmath147 on the dual links .",
    "we choose the higgs field to be compact 0-form @xmath148 on the dual sites constrained on the unit circle .",
    "finally we introduce an integer valued 0-form @xmath149 on the dual sites @xmath150 this differs from the lattice higgs action , eqn.([e1],[e5.1 ] ) , in two respects : ( i ) the gauge field is non - compact , and ( ii ) the villain@xcite form is employed .",
    "the variables @xmath149 are introduced in order to make the action periodic in @xmath151 .    to connect this theory to eqn.([deltap ] ) we first choose a gauge for which @xmath152 . then note that for large @xmath153 the integral over @xmath147 is peaked at the values @xmath154 .",
    "in the limit @xmath155 this becomes @xmath156 identifying @xmath149 with @xmath157 this is the same as eqn.([deltap ] ) with @xmath158 .",
    "following sec.[u1 ] the dual london penetration depth in this theory is given by @xmath159 .",
    "therefore in the weak magnetic coupling limit , @xmath160 , the u(1 ) gauge theory with the villain form of the action becomes a dual higgs theory with an infinite photon mass , i.e. zero london penetration depth , @xmath5 .",
    "we find in our simulations that @xmath5 decreases for decreasing @xmath7 .",
    "but we have only measured it for a very limited range of @xmath161 .",
    "the dual higgs field , @xmath162 has been connected to the monopole field operator@xcite .",
    "polikarpov , polley and wiese@xcite have calculated the constraint effective potential for this operator and showed that there is a global symmetry breaking in the dual superconducting phase .",
    "in ref.@xcite we applied these same techniques and showed that dual abrikosov vortices also occur in su(2 ) pure gauge theory in the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "matsubara et.al.@xcite confirmed these results with better statistics and generalized them to su(3 ) .",
    "the su(2 ) link matrices are @xmath163 and the action is @xmath164 the maximal abelian gauge is defined by maximizing the quantity @xmath165 .",
    "\\label{e8}\\ ] ] the abelian link angle is then taken as the phase of @xmath166_{11}$ ] and the calculation can proceed with little change@xcite .",
    "recently we have done the calculation at finite temperature in order to check this picture on each side of the deconfining phase transition@xcite which we report here .",
    "the results are shown in the confining phase , fig.[f4 ] , @xmath167 and the deconfining phase , fig.[f5 ] , @xmath168 on a lattice @xmath169 , with 800 measurements for each case .",
    "gauge fixing required about 600 sweeps for each configuration .",
    "fig.[f4 ] shows an important difference from the u(1 ) case .",
    "whereas in the u(1 ) case a linear combination of @xmath122 and @xmath170 for @xmath171 can vanish giving the london relation , it is clearly not possible here .",
    "the behavior of @xmath172 does not match that of @xmath122 .",
    "we interpret this discrepancy as a signal of a non - zero ginzburg - landau coherence length , @xmath4 .",
    "unlike the u(1 ) case , the extreme type ii limit , in which the superconducting order parameter turns on at the surface , the evidence here is that the order parameter turns on over a distance @xmath4 .",
    "the value of the coherence length is approximately the radius where the london relation is restored .",
    "the analysis in this more general situation precludes a point by point comparison of the @xmath122 and @xmath170 data .",
    "we adapt the analysis from tinkham@xcite .    in terms of a higgs model , the higgs field",
    "is not constrained to a certain vacuum expectation value but rather is subjected to a ssb potential eqn.([mexican ] ) .",
    "the equivalent gl theory provides a way to calculate the deformation of the higgs field @xmath13 between the normal core of a vortex and the asymptotic value at large distance from the vortex , @xmath173 .",
    "we write @xmath174 , where @xmath175 rises from @xmath176 over a distance @xmath4 . introducing a dual vector potential , @xmath177 ,",
    "the dual london equation is replaced by the dual gl equations for the azimuthal component of the monopole current . @xmath178 and @xmath179 satisfies @xmath180 the generalized fluxoid relation becomes @xmath181 an approximate solution of eqn.([ggll ] ) is @xmath182 with @xmath183 .",
    "an interpolation of the data is required to fit eqn.([144 ] ) .",
    "an example of the fit for @xmath184 in ref.@xcite is @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the behavior of all the su(2 ) and su(3 ) examples in the confined phase is similar to that shown in fig.[f4 ] .",
    "the interesting conclusion is that @xmath187 ( no relation to higgs @xmath61 ) for a type ii dual superconductor @xmath188 and a type i otherwise .",
    "these simulations indicate that the non - abelian dual superconductors lie at the borderline between type i and type ii .",
    "matsubara , ejiri and suzuki@xcite have measured @xmath153 for su(2 ) for @xmath189 and @xmath74 loops in the range @xmath190 ; and for su(3 ) for @xmath191 loop in the range @xmath192 .",
    "although they are not asymptotic , they find clear signals in these data for @xmath153 both larger and smaller than @xmath193 .",
    "the simulation@xcite shown in fig.[f5 ] was identical to fig.[f4 ] except that @xmath7 was increased to @xmath194 on a lattice @xmath195 putting us in the deconfining phase .",
    "the dramatic decrease of @xmath170 results in the failure of the dual superconductor interpretation as expected for the deconfining phase .",
    "also @xmath122 falls more slowly with radius .",
    "a further observation is that although this dual superconductivity signal drops rapidly above the deconfining temperature , the monopole density does not change dramatically . the monopole density @xmath60 is defined @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the integer valued lattice quantities and @xmath198 is the number of lattice sites . in ref.@xcite",
    "we find @xmath199",
    "many interesting superconducting properties can be elucidated by studying the properties of the material in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we report a preliminary look at the corresponding problem of dual superconductivity in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "the wilson loop provides such a field by projecting a @xmath200 out of vacuum configurations .",
    "but it may be interesting to see the spontaneous breaking of translation invariance as the electric flux forms a vortex rather than impose the vortex position at a given location and with quantized flux .",
    "type i and type ii dual superconductors respond very differently to background uniform external fields .    for a periodic u(1 )",
    "lattice the sum of the plaquette angles over any plane is identically zero . referring to fig.[ext ] a classical uniform electric field for u(1 ) on a particular time slice",
    "can still be obtained by constraining one plaquette angle in each @xmath93 plane to the value @xmath201 .",
    "then the remaining @xmath202 plaquette angles will take the common value @xmath203 giving a uniform electric field on all but one time slice .",
    "( n labels the lattice dimensions . )",
    "choosing @xmath204 gives the largest field .",
    "for an @xmath205 lattice and @xmath206 for example , there would be enough electric flux to form about 3 vortices in the @xmath207 plane in the dual superconducting phase .",
    "this field configuration can also be obtained by multiplying the plaquette that was singled out in the action by a minus sign and such configurations have been studied in non - abelian theories@xcite .",
    "we avoided an alternative method of imposing an external field by introducing a non - zero equilibrium value locally for each plaquette angle since we eventually want to see the field break translation invariance .",
    "turning on interactions for @xmath208 brings up other interesting features@xcite .",
    "our goal here is to try to see a signal showing that @xmath170 responds to the external field .",
    "the immediate problem is that the sum of @xmath209 over the any @xmath207 plane is identically zero , and the sum of @xmath210 is not .",
    "a sample configuration is given in fig.[zerosum ] .",
    "yet we expect the london relation to be satisfied .",
    "the only possibility is that translation invariance is broken which is expected since vortices segregate the superconducting and normal phases .",
    "we make the following rough ansatz that the local london relation is due to a the alignment of local current loops in the external field .",
    "this suggests that we truncate @xmath170 to include only values @xmath211 representing the winding of the current around the dual plaquette .",
    "we denote this @xmath212 . in this discussion",
    "we assume that the current @xmath213 takes only the values @xmath214 .",
    "the fractional population with values outside this range is small enough to be neglected .",
    "fig.[zerosum ] is a typical configuration for the confined phase .",
    "a value @xmath215 indicates that the current makes a complete loop , the value @xmath216 a partial loop , etc .",
    "the value @xmath217 corresponds to a single isolated straight current segment in the plane .",
    "one expects the local behavior of @xmath218 contributions to align themselves in the local external field .",
    "but there is no comparable local behavior for the @xmath217 contributions .",
    "globally of course they must all sum to zero .    on a large lattice where size effects are irrelevant",
    ", one can still expect @xmath219 to average to zero .",
    "this is precisely the behavior in an isolated vortex as discussed in sec.[latticehiggs ] .",
    "now we get a large signal for @xmath220 as shown in fig.[f6 ] with a sign that agrees with the sign in fig.[f3 ] for the superconducting region , @xmath171 .",
    "further if we recalculate fig.[f3 ] with the truncated current , we find a large suppression at @xmath221 and a moderate enhancement at the other points as shown in fig.[f7 ] .",
    "in other words this choice biases in favor of the dual superconducting phase .",
