    "in a recently published letter we have shown that the measurement of the magnetic moment of samples with ring geometry enables the identification of regions with degraded superconducting regions and can be used as a sensitive method to investigate the critical current density @xmath4 of high temperature superconducting thin films @xcite .",
    "the ac field amplitude dependence of the ac susceptibility of structured narrow rings provides the experimental foundation for this method . within the bean model and via the determination of the so - called penetration field @xmath5 ( at which the perfect diamagnetic shielding is lost ) and geometry parameters we obtain @xmath4 . in this work",

    "we have determined the flux creep exponent @xmath7 and compared it with the one determined by relaxation measurements with a squid .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a brief summary of the measured samples and experimental details . in section",

    "a 30 nm @xmath10 buffer layer was used .",
    "all the films were characterized by ac susceptibility measurements before structuring .",
    "results on the films can be found in @xcite .",

    "the resist was etched by laser apart from a thin , @xmath13  nm thick remaining film to prevent any damage of the superconducting layer .",
    "we used ion beam sputtering with argon to transfer the mask structure into the film .",

    "the beam was neutralized by means of a hot filament to prevent charge accumulation on the sample surface .",
    "the samples were mounted on a water - cooled and rotating sample holder to avoid an excessive increase of temperature during etching .",
    "table [ samples ] shows the main characteristics of the measured samples .",
    "in this section we briefly review the ac response of narrow superconducting rings as described in @xcite .",
    "we discuss the limit of a thin narrow ring of width @xmath16 much smaller than the mean radius @xmath17 , . within the bean model",
    "the virgin magnetization curve completely determines the hysteresis loop which has the shape of a parallelogram @xcite . from these loops one obtains the complex susceptibility of a superconducting narrow ring with constant @xmath4 . for cycled magnetic field",
    "we define the nonlinear susceptibility , the quantity we measure , as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnetic moment and @xmath20 the sample volume .",
    "the virgin magnetization curve of such a ring is composed of two straight lines , for and for , since the screening supercurrent in the ring is limited to a maximum value ( @xmath21 is the ring thickness ) . as long as holds for the current induced in the ring by the applied field @xmath22 , no magnetic flux can penetrate through the ring into the hole of the ring .",
    "when @xmath23 is reached the ring becomes transparent to magnetic flux .",
    "therefore , when the applied field is increased further , flux lines will move through the ring as described in @xcite .",
    "these authors treat the superconducting strip with transport current in an applied field . with the moving flux lines in the ring",
    ", magnetic flux enters the ring hole until the screening supercurrent decreases again to the value @xmath24 .",
    "the magnetic moment of the ring thus saturates at the value .",
    "the applied field value @xmath5 at which this saturation is reached follows from the inductivity @xmath25 of the flat narrow ring @xcite , with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux generated in the hole by a ring current @xmath27 is @xmath28 . as long as @xmath29 one has ideal screening , thus .",
    "equating these two fluxes one obtains for the flat ring . at @xmath30",
    "one reaches , thus .",
    "therefore , one can express @xmath4 as @xmath31 } h_p\\,.\\ ] ] the formulae given above are accurate to corrections of order @xmath32 since the precise values of @xmath19 and @xmath25 depend on the current distribution across the ring width @xmath16 which changes during the magnetization process .    with eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) and the expressions for @xmath33 which are given in @xcite we obtain the susceptibility of the ring normalized to the initial value @xmath34 , i.e. , to @xmath35 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these theoretical results have been confirmed experimentally in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "we use expression ( [ eq : jc ] ) to determine @xmath4 from the measured penetration field @xmath5 .      for high enough dc magnetic fields , the influence of flux creep should be taken into account in the ac response of the superconducting ring . in our analysis",
    "we use a current voltage law @xmath39 that is connected to a logarithmic dependence @xcite of the pinning potential on the current density and describes flux creep as an activated motion of vortices which have to overcome this potential .",

    "( [ ecvlaw ] ) includes the limiting cases of bean - like field distribution for which @xmath42 and of ohmic dissipation for which @xmath43 .    by investigating the frequency ( @xmath44 ) dependence of narrow rings under the application of a harmonic ac field @xmath45 during flux",
    "creep , , brandt @xcite derived a scaling law for the frequency and magnetic field amplitude which states the following : the complex ac susceptibility at fixed temperature remains unchanged under the simultaneous transformation of time by a constant factor @xmath46 , e.g. @xmath47 , and magnetic field by a factor @xmath48 , e.g. @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "this is equivalent to state that the following equation holds : @xmath51 using this property we determined the flux creep exponent @xmath52 at different @xmath53 and applied dc fields @xmath6 by measuring the ac susceptibility at different frequencies and by equating the ac fields at which the same susceptibility is measured , i.e. @xmath54 where @xmath46 is determined by the frequency ratio @xmath55 .",

    "recently confirmed the scaling relation for the nonlinear ac susceptibility response of hgba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath58 thin films @xcite . in a previous work @xcite",
    "the flux creep exponent @xmath59 was determined from the frequency dependence of @xmath60 in the limit of large ac amplitudes . in what follows we present a further confirmation of the scaling relation ( [ etransform ] ) by applying it on structured thin rings .",
    "furthermore , we use a straightforward analysis procedure to obtain the field dependence of the pinning potential @xmath61 for fields up to 2 t .",
    "in @xcite a drastic decrease of @xmath4 after structuring the films into rings was found .",
    "this behavior has been explained by the existence of microcracks in the path of the ring . in this paper",
    "we show that the structuring technology used to fabricate the superconducting ring has a large influence on its @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ jcla2 ] shows the temperature dependence of the critical current density @xmath4 for sample  la2 before and after structuring by laser ablation . for this sample and before structuring @xmath4 is 500 times larger than its value after structuring . for comparison the @xmath4 values for the sample  ie1 before and after structuring by ion beam etching",

    "we have found that @xmath4 of the measured la - rings is at least 100 times smaller than @xmath4 before structuring . on the other hand",
    "the results for the ie - rings vary only a few percent .    on the origin of the remarkable difference in @xmath4 of the rings structured by laser ablation we speculate as follows .",
    "during treatment by the laser the tiny region within the laser spot is heated up to several thousands kelvin for a few milliseconds . because of the bad thermal conductivity of the substrate the temperature of the film rises to several hundred degrees in a small region around the spot as well .",
    "it is known that heating can change the oxygen concentration of @xmath62 . as a result",
    "the superconducting properties at the edges of the structured path may be altered up to the complete loss of superconductivity . also , thermally induced shock waves may produce microcracks within the width of the ring and degrade the maximum critical current density .",
    "our measurements of the thickness profile of the ring after structuring indicate a region of @xmath63 at the edges of the ring where the film appears to be completely damaged .",
    "in contrast we found sharp edges on films structured by ion beam etching .    to compare both structuring methods we can use a better way to present the data by plotting the in phase component of the magnetic moment @xmath64 as a function of the ac magnetic field amplitude .",
    "this is shown for the rings  la2 , fig .",
    "[ mla2 ] and  ie1 , fig .",
    "[ mie1 ] . the la - ring in fig .",
    "[ mla2 ] shows a clear two - step - transition , one in the low - field - range and the other in the high - field range .",
    "we recognize a crossover from the ring with a lower @xmath4 to the bulk signal for a long strip @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ mla2 ] . on the other hand the ie - ring in fig .",
    "[ mie1 ] shows only a slight deviation from the expected ideal ring behavior ( continuous line in fig .",
    "[ mie1 ] ) very probaly due to small inhomogeneities within the ring .    to check whether the laser ablation structuring process leads to a `` homogeneous '' or `` inhomogeneous '' @xmath4 over the width of the ring we structured sample",
    "la1 once more by ion beam etching from a width of 0.2 mm to 0.05 mm .",
    "whereas in the `` homogeneous '' case we do not expect a change in the measured @xmath4 in the `` inhomogeneous '' case a different value for @xmath4 should be measured due to the existence of islands with higher or lower critical current density . in fig .",
    "[ jcla1 ] the results for the two consecutive structuring procedures are shown .",
    "we assign the observed decrease in @xmath4 after the second structuring to tiny islands of lower @xmath4 which are along the path of the ring with smaller width and were created after the first laser ablation structuring , indicating strongly inhomogeneous film properties .    in a similar experiment we reduced the width of the ie - ring  ( notch ) by cutting a notch into it by ion beam etching , leaving only a small ( 16 @xmath65 m ) path where the current can flow . by this",
    "means we basically measure @xmath4 in the path region .",
    "figure  [ jcnotch ] presents the critical current density corresponding to bulk , ring and ring - notch signal . within experimental uncertainty @xmath4",
    "remains unchanged .",
    "this result supports the assumption of a homogeneous @xmath4 in the film .",
    "ion beam etching is therefore a far less destructive structuring technique than laser ablation .",
    "for the measurements presented in this section we have chosen rings with highest critical current density and with different radius to width ratios , e.g. rings  ie1 and  ie2 . together with a dc bias field the small ac perturbation @xmath66mt was applied . in fig .",
    "[ pdcshift ] one recognizes that the dc bias field mainly shifts @xmath67 to lower ac amplitudes and leaves the dependence of @xmath68 on the ac field amplitude essentially unaltered .",
    "this behavior is due to a decrease in the critical current density that determines the field @xmath69 at which the magnetic flux enters into the center of the ring .    during the increase of the applied dc field",
    "a current is induced in the ring . as described in section [ s : ac ] perfect shielding occurs as long as the current density is below the critical one . at currents larger than @xmath4 flux can move into the center until the critical value is reached again . at large dc fields the magnetic moment of the ring",
    "thus saturates at a value that is determined by the shielding capability of the ring which is given by the critical current related to the specific dc field . by applying then a harmonic ac signal to the ring",
    ", its magnetic moment has a hysteresis loop around the static dc bias field similar as for @xmath70 .",
    "since the application of the dc field leads to flux penetration it will influence the pinning of vortices in the ring material as well . by this",
    "means the flux creep exponent @xmath71 is altered . in fig .",
    "[ pdcshift ] an increase in flux creep can be found for large dc fields . as predicted by brandt @xcite a slight smoothing of or @xmath60 around the penetration field @xmath5",
    "is observed for increasing dc field , i.e. decreasing  @xmath59 .",
    "from the shift of @xmath5 with dc field one can determine the field dependence of @xmath4 shown in fig .",
    "[ pfieldjc ] .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath4 we obtain is similar to that measured by vibrating reed experiments in y123 thin films @xcite .",
    "the observed field dependence of @xmath4 can be understood within the collective pinning theory for three dimensional pinning mechanism @xcite .",
    "three dimensional pinning is assumed since the correlation length of the vortex lines along the field direction is smaller than the thickness of the films @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field independence of @xmath4 observed at low fields indicate that the vortices are pinned independently , i.e. the single vortex pinning regime . at higher fields",
    "the interaction between flux lines leads to the formation of flux bundles which are pinned collectively and therefore @xmath4 decreases with field .",
    "in what follows we concentrate on the field dependence of the pinning potential @xmath61 . for a series of dc fields we measured the amplitude dependence of @xmath60 at four different frequencies .",
    "such a scan can be seen in fig .",
    "[ psuscf](a ) for the ring  ie2 . in a step by step procedure",
    "we determine the ac field amplitudes corresponding to the frequencies for a fixed value of @xmath60 where the slope is largest .",
    "this is indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ psuscf](a ) .",
    "then we plot the logarithm of the obtained magnetic ac field amplitudes versus the logarithm of the respective frequencies , see fig .",
    "[ pfshift ] , and by performing a linear fit we determine the corresponding slope @xmath50 for different dc fields . within the available frequency range",
    "this plot gives straight lines for fixed dc field and temperature as theoretically @xcite expected .",
    "this gives the flux creep exponent @xmath59 for fixed temperature and dc field , see eq .",

    "one only needs to measure @xmath68 around the maximum in @xmath72 to determine the shift of @xmath60 with frequency ( only 15 to 20 points per scan ) .",
    "the necessary information on the ac field amplitude range to be measured at each dc field can be obtained by a preliminary scan . within 20 hours",
    "we were thus able to measure the scans required to determine @xmath7 for 10 dc fields at one fixed temperature .",
    "scans for the two selected rings and temperatures and have been performed and analyzed in this manner .",
    "the dependence of the flux creep exponent @xmath7 and the pinning potential @xmath73 on dc field are shown in fig .",
    "[ pufield ] . in fig .",
    "[ pufield](a ) one clearly sees the strong decrease of @xmath59 with dc field .",
    "it can be also noted that @xmath59 increases the lower the temperature of the ring .",
    "the large values of @xmath74 at @xmath70 for both rings are consistent with the little frequency dependence of the ac response at low dc fields .",
    "for this reason the bean model is a good approximation in this limit . at the same @xmath53 and @xmath6 we find .",
    "we assign this difference in @xmath59 between the two rings to variations in the film properties from which the rings were structured .",
