    "the kondo effect , a typical many - body effect in metals with dilute magnetic impurities , has given exciting topics for decades.@xcite the kondo effect gives rise to the formation of local singlet states between itinerant electrons and localized spins .",

    "the fluctuation of localized spins is significantly enhanced by the spin - flip scattering of conduction electrons at the fermi level .",

    "the kondo effect has been observed when they are coupled to external leads.@xcite in this case , the kondo effect enhances the conductance through the qds since the conduction electrons are resonantly transported through the kondo singlet state .    lately",
    ", spin - dependent transport has been of great interest from a viewpoint of spin - based electronics , so - called spintronics.@xcite a notable example is the tunnel magnetresistance in a spin - valve geometry , in which two ferromagnetic leads are separated by a non - magnetic insulating layer.@xcite the tunnel current is proportional to @xmath15 in the parallel ( p ) alignment of two ferromagnets , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the density of states for majority and minority spins , respectively .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath18 in the antiparallel ( ap ) alignment , which is smaller than that in the p alignment for @xmath19 . when the p alignment is changed to ap alignment by applying a magnetic field , an extremely large magnetresistance is observed.@xcite the spin - valve effect in a qd sandwiched by two ferromagnetic leads has also been investigated.@xcite    in this article , we pay attention to the kondo effect in the spin - valve geometry including a qd .",
    "this kondo effect has been studied theoretically @xcite with motives elucidating how the ferromagnetism of the leads influences the fluctuation of a localized spin .",
    "one of the theoretical problems was whether the energy levels in the qds are spin - split @xcite or not@xcite in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the numerical renormalization group technique , which is one of the most reliable methods to treat the kondo physics , concluded the existence of the spin splitting , @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the spin splitting arises from the spin - dependent charge fluctuations by the tunnel coupling to the ferromagnets and weakens the kondo effect.@xcite the spin splitting has been observed in experiments as the suppression of zero - bias anomaly of the differential conductance , which is a hallmark of the kondo effect .",

    ", we evaluate @xmath13 using the slave - boson mean - field ( sbmf ) theory.@xcite the sbmf theory describes the kondo resonant state on the assumption of its presence and fermi liquid behavior .",

    "when @xmath38 , the sbmf theory yields the formation of the kondo resonant state at the fermi level .",
    "the kondo temperature , which is defined by the width of the resonance , decreases with increasing @xmath11 , in semi - quantitative agreement with that obtained by the scaling method .",
