    "one of the extensions of electrostatics beyond coulomb interactions is the interaction of charged conductors with multiple modes of polarization .",
    "the relatively simple problem of two charged metal spheres has been studied from a theoretical and pedagogical standpoint using image charges @xcite @xcite .",
    "in addition , more complex methods using image charges @xcite and boundary element methods @xcite have been developed for multiple - particle configurations .",
    "here we derive a new method to calculate the electrostatic interaction energy of charged conducting spheres that utilizes multipole expansions of the potential and charge density .",
    "this method can be expanded to any number of conductors or to an arbitrary precision by including higher order multipoles in the calculation .",
    "this approach is motivated by the assembly configurations of binary nanoparticle super lattices ( bnsls ) .",
    "guided by a complex combination of entropic and electromagnetic interactions , these lattices can assemble in a vast array of different shapes and configurations . in order to better understand the assembly of these lattices ,",
    "a number of experimental studies have tried to isolate and analyze the different interactions driving the assembly@xcite . here",
    "we focus on analyzing the electrostatic interactions that guide the assembly of the metal nanoparticles at the center of these lattices .    normally in electrostatic problems ,",
    "most of the higher order interactions can be ignored since the monopole and dipole terms dominate the energy equation for large separations .",
    "once the scale of the configuration approaches the scale of the nanoparticles , the quadrupole or octupole interactions can be on the same order as some monopole interactions @xcite . since these assemblies can also include nanoparticles in contact , there is no assumption that can justify ignoring multipole terms beyond the dipole .",
    "this multipole expansion method allows the interaction between any number of conducting spheres to be calculated using an arbitrary number of multipoles",
    ". this will provide insight into why bnsls only assemble with certain configurations of metal nanoparticles by allowing a direct energy comparison across different configurations .",
    "moreover , it will allow us to analyze how the geometry of a configuration influences the relative strength of various multipoles in a configuration . + we proceed in deriving the equations for the energy of the configuration by first looking at the energy between two charged spheres . to make this calculation easier ,",
    "we begin by assuming that the two spheres lie on the z - axis of our arbitrarily selected coordinate system .",
    "once we find the energy equations in this simplified aligned case , we derive the transformation to express the energy equations in any arbitrary frame .",
    "the accuracy of this method is then checked against existing literature calculations , and then we generalize the energy equations to include an arbitrary number of spheres . finally , we present calculations for a number configurations and comment on the accuracy and insights of the multipole expansion method .",
    "to calculate the multipole expansion of the energy , we start with the energy equation : @xmath0 this can be broken up into the pairwise sphere interactions for n spheres : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the charge density on sphere i , @xmath3 is the potential on sphere j , and the integration is carried over the volume of sphere i. the terms where @xmath4 represent the energy cost of holding a charge distribution on the sphere , further referred to as the self - energy .",
    "the other terms represent the interaction energy , or the energy associated with charge distributions and potentials on different spheres .",
    "we now find the multipole expansion of the charge distribution and potential for a general sphere @xmath5 .",
    "the charge distribution on sphere @xmath5 ( with radius @xmath6 ) is given by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , etc .",
    "represent the complex conjugates of @xmath9 etc .",
    "the @xmath10 s are related to the multipole moments , @xmath11 s , as defined by jackson ( gaussian or cgs units ) @xcite where : @xmath12 to calculate the potential , we expand the formula for the potential in terms of the sphere s multipoles : @xmath13      to calculate the energy explicitly , we start by just considering two spheres , a and b , with their charge distributions and potentials given by replacing the label s with labels a and b in equations [ eq : dist ] and [ eq : potent ] . thus the total interaction energy is given by :        @xmath14    we will continue by deriving the formula for @xmath15 .",
    "the other half of the interaction energy , @xmath16 , can be derived by using @xmath17 and @xmath18 in place of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , all odd order multipoles need to be multiplied by a @xmath21 since the alignment of a positive multipole this adds a @xmath22 factor to the odd ordered b multipoles in the derivation of @xmath16 . ] . for the calculation of two aligned spheres , the radius term in the potential ( @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ eq : potent ] ) is the distance between a point on sphere a and the center of sphere b. this gives the @xmath15 interaction energy as : @xmath24 we can find the form for @xmath25 using the law of cosines : @xmath26 plugging this in and integrating over the radius variable , gives the energy as : @xmath27 the expression contained inside the radical is the generating function for the gegenbauer polynomials@xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "this allows us to express the denominator as a power series in @xmath32 with the coefficients being the gegenbauer polynomials@xmath33 . through a transformation matrix of coefficients ,",
    "the denominator is changed from an expansion of gegenbauer polynomials into an expansion of spherical harmonics .",
    "this is done through the following transformation : @xmath34 where we defined @xmath35 as : @xmath36 and utilized the following identity : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the p - th legendre polynomial @xcite .",

    ". we can also simplify the integral to be performed by utilizing the wigner 3-j symbols to decompose the product of spherical harmonics into a sum .",
    "this formula is given by @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the appropriate wigner 3-j symbol with the convention used in @xcite and @xmath51 .",
    "this gives us a final expression for @xmath15 : @xmath52 this is the interaction energy that we will use to calculate the energy for a configuration of spheres .",
    "to give an example of what the individual energy terms are , we integrate this formula explicitly for the first few multipoles . for simplicity in reporting the expansion below",
    ", we assume that the spheres are of equal size ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "in addition , we will assume the two spheres are separated by a distance much larger than their individual radii ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this allows us to take the following simplification : multipoles that occur in the general case interaction energy . ]",
    "@xmath55\\right ) } \\rightarrow \\pi\\ ] ] using this simplification we expand @xmath15 and report the terms of order @xmath56 or lower : @xmath57 these are the terms of the multipole expansion of the partial interaction energy , @xmath15 , up to the dipole - dipole interaction in the special case where the spheres are far apart and aligned along the @xmath58 axis .",
    "to generalize for spheres not aligned along the @xmath59 axis , the expression for @xmath25 becomes : @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the polar and azimuthal angles between @xmath63 and the vector @xmath25 .",
    "when the spheres were aligned along the @xmath64 axis , we were able to simplify the equations since @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "+ we start with same gegenbauer expansion method presented above , but we also need to rotate the spherical harmonics in @xmath67 to spherical harmonics in @xmath68 by using the euler angles @xmath69 that separate the two frames . in our specific case , we are only rotating the center point of a sphere to the z - axis without changing the orientation .",
    "this means that one of the euler angles , @xmath70 , will not have any effect on the orientation of the spheres .",
    "thus we can take @xmath71 and just use two euler angles to describe the rotation .",
    "the following transformation converts the spherical harmonics with @xmath67 arguments to spherical harmonics with @xmath68 arguments : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the standard finite rotations operator that can be found in landau and lifshitz @xcite . + this transformation allows us to easily calculate the interaction energy equation for a configuration of multiple spheres . in a configuration with more than two spheres ,",
    "each pairwise interaction energy has the same form as equation [ eq : f_aligned ] when the coordinate systems are aligned along each line of action ( i.e. along @xmath63 as @xmath61 is in figure 2b . ) . instead of recalculating the entire energy series for every orientation",
    ", we can utilize the fact that the rotation of the spherical harmonics is a linear transformation ( see appendix [ app : linear ] ) .",
    "the transformation allows us to take each multipole referred in these local pairwise frames and transform them all to the same configuration - wide @xmath68 coordinate system .",
    "this expands the @xmath74 and @xmath75 multipoles in @xmath76 in terms of new multipoles @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the @xmath68 frame .",
    "this gives us the transformation : @xmath79 the rotation coefficients can be further decomposed into their three constituent parts : @xmath80 @xmath81 applying this transformation to the multipoles changes the expression for @xmath82 to : @xmath83 this new form for @xmath82 is then plugged into equation [ eq : f_aligned ] .",
    "this gives us a completely general expression for the interaction energy between two arbitrarily oriented spheres .",
    "to see what the first few energy terms are , we integrate equation [ eq : f_aligned ] explicitly and obtain the formula for the interaction energy between the two spheres . due to limited space",
    "we show only the monopole - monopole and dipole - monopole terms in the @xmath84 limit below : @xmath85      the self - energy formulas are much easier to derive .",
    "starting with the expression for the energy in equation [ eq : ijenergy ] , we set @xmath4 and use the charge density and potential definitions from equations [ eq : dist ] and [ eq : potent ] .",
    "this gives the self - energy for sphere a is : @xmath86 simplifying and utilizing the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics to perform the integration yields : @xmath87    applying the same process to sphere b yields the same exact result in terms of the @xmath88 s instead of the @xmath89 s . by combining the interaction energies and the self energy from both spheres we obtain a energy formula that can be expanded to any order interaction .",
    "due to the many summations in the interaction energy formula , the computation of relatively small order interactions ( like the monopole - dipole interaction ) can be extremely complicated and asymmetric .",
    "for example , the computation time needed to calculate @xmath90 ( a monopole on sphere a and a dipole on sphere b ) is the interaction energy between a dipole on sphere a and a monopole on sphere b calculated with the @xmath15 formula .",
    "@xmath91 is the interaction energy between a monopole on sphere b and a quadrupole on sphere a calculated from the @xmath16 formula ] is much longer than the computation time needed to calculate @xmath92 even though both represent the same electrostatic interaction .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "[ eq : integral ] , it is clear that the @xmath93 exponent makes @xmath15 more difficult to calculate as the multipole order increases .",
    "this calculation can be simplified by making use of green s reciprocation theorem to reduce the order of the exponent in eq .",
    "[ eq : integral ] @xcite .",
    "when constructing the interaction energy @xmath15 , we can split the calculation up into each of the different components : @xmath94 from green s reciprocation theorem , we know that : @xmath95 in order to calculate @xmath90 , we would need to expand @xmath96 in another series .",
    "thus , it is advantageous to use @xmath92 instead since it avoids having to use any further expansions or unnecessary computation time",
    ". this renders the interaction energy as : @xmath97 this same idea is then applied to further terms in the expansion ( e.g. replacing @xmath98 with @xmath99 ) .",
    "+ in addition , green s reciprocal theorem also states that @xmath100 . with proper attention to the conjugation of multipoles",
    ", there is no need to calculate @xmath16 . since substitutions",
    "can rotate our aligned energy into any rotated frame ( see section [ sec : nonaligned ] ) , no calculations beyond @xmath15 in the aligned case are needed to obtain the full interaction energy ( @xmath101 ) , for any orientation .      here",
    "we will check specific terms of the energy equation against other known equations .",
    "we will use the simpler aligned version of the energy equation for these calculations .",
    "the first and easiest check is that the monopole - monopole interaction gives the correct coulomb energy . for two charged spheres",
    ", we use the definitions of the multipole moments in jackson @xcite , @xmath102 to find : @xmath103 which agrees with the coulomb energy of two point charges .",
    "the dipole - monopole and the dipole - dipole energies derived from our equations also agree with the jackson formulas .",
    "to check the dipole - monopole energy , we use the simplification of section [ sec : green ] and plug in the values of the multipoles to find : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the dipole on sphere a , and @xmath106 is the electric field due to a monopole on sphere b. this agrees with the formula for the energy of a perfect dipole in an electric field . for the dipole - dipole interaction ,",
    "we start with the formula for the interaction between two dipoles given by jackson @xcite : @xmath107 since this formula is for the energy between two perfect dipoles , we recalculate the dipole - dipole term of our interaction energy assuming @xmath108 in order to compare it to the jackson formula . using the green s theorem simplification from section [ sec : green ] again and taking the dipole - dipole term from the @xmath15 expansion yields : @xmath109    now looking at the jackson formula , we note that the distance between the two dipoles will be @xmath63 . since the dipoles could either be aligned in the same direction or in opposing directions , there is a plus or minus factor in front of the formula : @xmath110 which agrees with our lowest order term from the dipole - dipole interaction energy expansion .",
    "+ we can also compare a numerical result from our calculations with an analytical solution done by maxwell@xcite .",
    "maxwell finds that two touching spheres of radius @xmath111 held at potential @xmath112 statvolt each have a charge of @xmath113 .",
    "taking @xmath114 cm and using the equations for the energy stored in a capacitor we find : @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the energy stored in the capacitor .",
    "this is extremely close to our energy values for the @xmath118 limiting case .",
    "in addition , our formula converges rather quickly to the correct value .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] comparison of calculated energies with analytic maxwell energies [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     to calculate the energies reported above , we explicitly performed the integrations from our final energy equation using mathematica .",
    "we then minimized the energy equation utilizing the matrix formalism detailed in the next section .",
    "the gegenbauer expansion of the denominator , @xmath25 , was taken out to the sixth gegenbauer polynomial .",
    "this was the point at which we started getting marginal returns in the percent difference between our calculated energy and maxwell s figures .",
    "the second gegenbauer expansion used in the expansion of @xmath39 was taken out to the first term .",
    "this provided improvement over the small angle approximation and left the integrals still analytically computable by mathematica .",
    "these formulas are generalized for any number of spheres by writing the multipoles as a vector and the individual terms of the energy as the entries of a matrix .",
    "this gives us the following matrix equation for the energy between any number of spheres : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a vector containing all the multipoles for all the spheres to a particular order and @xmath121 is the energy matrix that contains all the coefficients for the different multipole interactions .",
    "the diagonal terms of @xmath122 are the self - energy terms , while generally , @xmath123 is the interaction between the @xmath124 and the @xmath125 multipoles .",
    "the left section of @xmath122 for a three sphere calculation up to dipoles is produced in the appendix .",
    "the minimum of equation [ eq : matrix ] occurs in the trivial case when all the multipoles are equal to zero . to examine the non - trivial cases we need to find the constrained minimum by minimizing the function : @xmath126 where @xmath127 are the undetermined multipliers for the constraints .",
    "the term @xmath128 is a dummy variable that uses the dot product @xmath129 to select out a specific multipole to constrain .",
    "the variable @xmath130 is the constrained value for that specific multipole .",
    "for example , to constrain the monopole term on sphere a to be one , the second term of the equation would take the following form : @xmath131= \\lambda ( a_{0}^{0 } -1)\\ ] ]    while we can arbitrarily constrain any multipole , our calculations only constrain the monopole terms since they correspond to the total charge on each sphere . for a configuration with three spheres ,",
    "there are three different constraint equations ; one for the monopole term on each sphere .    in order to minimize @xmath132",
    ", we take the derivative of equation [ eq : langmatrix ] and set it equal to zero .",
    "the derivative is easy to calculate since @xmath122 is a hermitian matrix , and this yields the multipoles , @xmath120 , that minimize the constrained equation : @xmath133 by using this matrix formalism and solving for the unconstrained multipliers we can find the multipoles that minimize the electrostatic energy for any given number of charged conducting spheres .",
    "here we present the configuration energy and the work required to remove a bounded sphere for various configurations .",
    "the configuration energy includes both the interaction and self energies of all the spheres except the monopole self energy .",
    "since we constrain the monopole terms to constant values , we omit them from the energy data . the work required to remove a sphere is calculated by finding the difference in configuration energy between the original configuration and the configuration with one sphere removed . in the case of two spheres ,",
    "the work needed to remove a sphere is the same as the configuration energy . in the case of three spheres ,",
    "we subtract the total configuration energy from the energy of the two - sphere system that results after we remove a sphere . for asymmetrical configurations ,",
    "we compare the work required to remove each of the different spheres and report the minimum .",
    "the spheres in the figures are shaded with their charge density .",
    "the coloring goes from blue to red as the charge density goes from negative to positive ( color online , dark to light in grayscale ) .",
    "in addition there are lines drawn around the z - axis of each sphere to help qualitatively show the orientation of the charge on the spheres .",
    "the figures are meant to show alignment of the various higher - order multipoles relative to the other spheres in its own figure .",
    "the shading scale was varied between different figures to provide enough contrast within a figure .",
    "in constructing these configurations , we label spheres with letters ( a , b , c ... ) usually placing sphere a at the origin as a convention .",
    "since the equations are rotationally invariant usually only one specific configuration is present ( i.e. no more than one equilateral triangle with one charged sphere will be looked at since all three possibilities are equivalent ) .    for the calculations",
    ", we used the same parameters discussed in section [ sec : check ] when we compared our energy values with maxwell s calculations .",
    "charged spheres had their monopole constrained so that the sphere has one statcoulomb of charge .",
    "all spheres have radius of 1 cm , and all energies are reported in ergs ( gaussian or cgs units ) .        in the case of two spheres ,",
    "there are only two different configurations of interest .",
    "the first is when both spheres have equal charges .",
    "this induces multipoles equal in magnitude for both spheres and equal binding energies for each sphere . when only one sphere is charged , the higher order multipole terms have a much stronger role . looking back at the explicit interaction energy expansion , the first three terms of the energy expansion are the monopole - monopole energy and the two monopole - dipole interactions . however , only one of those three terms is non - zero when one sphere is left uncharged .",
    "this results in the binding energy for the more weakly bound sphere ( sphere b ) to increase 43% when the expansion is extended from the dipole - dipole interaction up to the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "if we take the calculation up to the octupole - octupole interaction , the binding energy of that sphere increases by another 15% .",
    "this is compared to only about a 0.2% difference between the quadrupole - quadrupole and octupole - octupole calculations in the configuration with both spheres charged .",
    "if we had arbitrarily cut off the calculation at the dipole - dipole term of the configuration with only one sphere charged , we would have seen a binding energy for sphere b that is about one - third of the strength it actually is .",
    "this shows evidence for why higher ordered terms can not be arbitrarily ignored in these energy calculations .",
    "also , since the configuration energy relies heavily on higher order multipoles , the energy values do not converge quickly when only one sphere is charged .",
    "for the three sphere case , the minimal energy configuration is the equilateral triangle ( configuration a ) .",
    "this is followed by the isosceles triangle ( config .",
    "b ) and the middle - charged line of spheres ( config .",
    "c ) . as more",
    "multipoles are added , the minimal energy configuration changes . when only dipoles are taken into account ,",
    "both the isosceles triangle and the middle - charged line of spheres are favored over the equilateral triangle .",
    "this is due to minimal dipole - dipole interaction between the two uncharged spheres in each configuration .",
    "the isosceles triangle configuration induces mutually orthogonal dipoles on the two uncharged spheres , reducing the energetic cost of the configuration . in the middle - charged line of spheres ,",
    "the monopole on the middle sphere dominates the energy equation through the monopole - dipole terms .",
    "the antiparallel dipoles that are induced on the two uncharged spheres have only a slight effect on the configuration energy . however , this effect is strong enough to give the configuration a slightly higher energy than the isosceles triangle .",
    "once we add quadrupoles , the dipole advantages discussed above are much less influential , causing the equilateral triangle becomes the minimal energy configuration .",
    "since all the dipoles in the equilateral triangle line up to the same point in space , there is much more repulsive interaction between the dipoles than in the isosceles triangle configuration .",
    "this caused it to have a misleadingly higher configuration energy when only dipoles are considered . with",
    "the quadrupoles added , the equilateral triangle experiences the largest increase in binding energy , making it the lowest energy configuration .",
    "the symmetry of this configuration causes the energy to be more dependent on quadrupole terms than the isosceles triangle or the middle - charged line of spheres .",
    "this shows that some configurations show non - regular convergence when different multipoles are added to the calculation .",
    "in particular , the work to remove a sphere from configuration d is not even monotonically decreasing as we add higher order terms , demonstrating the significant effect that the geometry of the configuration has on the binding energies .",
    "in addition , configurations with uncharged spheres equidistant from the charged sphere have stronger binding energies . the line with a charge on the end ( config .",
    "d ) and the isosceles triangle with a charge on one of the legs ( config e ) are the most weakly bound configurations .",
    "both of these configurations are asymmetrical in the sense that the two uncharged spheres are not equidistant from the charged sphere .",
    "judging from the charge distribution diagrams of these configurations , it seems that the asymmetric configurations restrict the polarization of one of the uncharged spheres .",
    "this prevents the configuration energy from lowering as far as the other three configurations that all feature the uncharged spheres equidistant from the charged sphere .",
    "we also see that the energy convergence of the equilateral triangle s configuration energy is similar to the the two sphere case .",
    "the binding energy increases by 86% when the calculation order is taken from dipoles up to quadrupoles and a further 16% when octupole interactions are added in , comparable to the convergence seen in the two sphere case .",
    "however , there is variability in energy convergence for different configurations .",
    "for example , the binding energy for configurations c and d only increase by 1.5% and 8% respectively when the calculation is extended from quadrupoles to octupoles .          for configurations with four spheres ,",
    "the minimal energy configuration is the regular tetrahedron ( config .",
    "a ) . much like in the three - sphere case , the minimal energy configuration changes as additional multipole terms are added to the calculation . when only dipoles are considered , the minimal energy configuration is the non - regular tetrahedron ( config .",
    "since most of the faces of this tetrahedron are isosceles triangles , the behavior of this configuration is similar to the isosceles triangle that we analyzed in the three - sphere case .",
    "as before , the configurations that induce dipoles in mutually orthogonal direction will appear to have an energetic advantage when the calculation only includes dipole terms .",
    "the regular tetrahedron ( config .",
    "a ) mimics the behavior of the equilateral triangle , with all of the spheres induced dipoles focusing on a common point .",
    "this causes strong interactions between the induced dipoles and makes configuration a look less favorable when only including dipole interactions in the calculation .",
    "thus , when only dipoles are included in the calculations , there is an intrinsic bias for configurations that feature mutually orthogonal dipoles .",
    "this bias , caused by arbitrarily cutting off the calculation at the dipole - dipole interaction , results in incorrect conclusions for the minimal energy configuration .",
    "once quadrupoles are added , the configurations take the same order as when the calculation is carried out to octupoles . the regular tetrahedron ( config .",
    "a ) is the preferred configuration with the charged blunt - end rhombus as the next most favored .",
    "note the significant energy difference between the two rhombus configurations ( configs .",
    "b and d ) .",
    "when the blunt - end particle is charged in a rhombus , the charged sphere is in contact with all of the other three spheres in the configuration causing significant polarizations in the three uncharged sphere .",
    "however , in the sharp - end charged rhombus ( config .",
    "d ) , the charged sphere is only in contact with two other spheres .",
    "this causes a much smaller polarizing effect on the third sphere and makes the configuration less energetically favorable when compared with the blunt - end charged rhombus ( config b ) .",
    "here we presented a new method utilizing multipole expansions to calculate the energy of charged conducting sphere configurations .",
    "this method can be used for any number of spheres in an arbitrary configuration , and it is easily expanded to any multipole order .    as seen from the configurations we considered , cutting off the energy expansion at arbitrary multipole orders ( like at the dipole - dipole or quadrupole - quadrupole level ) gives an incorrect picture of the energetically preferred configurations .",
    "in addition , there are intrinsic biases towards particular configurations .",
    "configurations that induce mutually orthogonal dipoles , were favored when we cut off the energy expansion at the dipole - dipole interaction .    in this study , we truncated the energy expansion at the octupole - octupole level . in the case of two charged spheres ,",
    "this was sufficient since the energy converged quickly ; the energy only increased 0.2% when the calculation was taken from quadrupoles up to octupoles .",
    "however , this is not the case when we move on to more general configurations with multiple spheres . in general",
    ", the more spheres in a configuration , the more the energy calculations rely on higher order multipoles , and the less quickly the energy converges .",
    "the calculations here were also subject to an arbitrary cut - off for interactions at the octupole - octupole level . given more computing power or patience ,",
    "the calculations could be extended even further .",
    "we can extend this study by analyzing further how different multipoles interact in various configurations .",
    "for example , a family of configurations could be found where the configuration energy only slightly changes with the addition of quadrupoles .",
    "this implies that the specific geometry of the configuration reduces or neutralizes the quadrupole - quadrupole interactions . by identifying similar configurations",
    ", more complex tailor - made materials can be created that utilize configuration geometry to reduce individual inter - particle interactions .",
