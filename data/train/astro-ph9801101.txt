    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short period ( @xmath5  hr ) interacting binaries in which a roche lobe filling k or m dwarf transfers matter into a white dwarf companion . some of these binaries contain strongly magnetic ( @xmath6  g ) white dwarfs and the accreting matter is funneled radially onto the magnetic poles .",
    "standoff shocks are produced above the white dwarf surface which can efficiently convert the infall energy to x - rays . in some of these cvs  polars or am her systems  the magnetic field of the primary is so strong that it generates the signature of magnetic accretion : large linear and circular optical polarization , and the primary is secularly phase - locked . in others",
    " intermediate polars , commonly called dq  her stars  the primaries have less powerful magnetic fields and there is no detectable polarization at optical wavelengths .",
    "magnetic cvs show short timescale periodic variations ( from @xmath7  s to 2  hr ) in the optical light as well as in the x - ray emission .",
    "the pulses are attributed to the rotation of the magnetic white dwarf ( see e.g.  patterson 1994 ; dobrzycka , kenyon & milone 1996 )",
    ". however , the majority of cvs are weakly magnetized systems where the accreting material has excess momentum which does not allow matter to fall directly onto the white dwarf .",
    "this accreting matter loses angular momentum gradually as it spirals inward , which leads to the formation of an accretion disc .",

    "on october 21 the mcgraw - hill 1.3-meter telescope at the mdm observatory with the ccd camera was used ; remaining observations ( october 28 - 30 and december 17 - 18 , 1996 ) were performed with the the flwo 1.2-meter telescope with the ccd camera .",
    "the october observations were obtained by k.  stanek .",
    "we used standard ubvr filters with response curves close to those listed in bessell ( 1990 ) and auto - guided every observation . on both occasions the object appeared to be much fainter than b  @xmath1  16.8  mag , which was its brightness when it was originally discovered on the schmidt plates",
    "we were able to place only upper limit of b  @xmath33  18.7  mag .",
    "we estimated the upper limit for the brightness of , judging from the detection of other faint stars in the field of view , which had b magnitudes ranging from 17 to 18.7  mag ( see below ) .",
    "since  seems to undergo low and high states it is interesting to investigate its light variations from archival observations .",
    "we collected the available estimates of the star brightness ; we list them , together with our data , in table  2 .",
    "the object is relatively faint , and so we were able to detect it only on the plates from the mc series of the sky patrol plates in the harvard plate archive .",
    "these plates have limiting magnitude of 17  mag .",
    "the plates were taken in a photographic bandpass ; we related the @xmath34 magnitudes from the plates to the @xmath35 magnitude using the formula from allen ( 1973 ) , @xmath36  mag . on each plate we looked for  and for several neighboring stars , which had brightness ranging from @xmath37 to 18.6  mag .",
    "their magnitudes were derived from the digitized sky survey and have uncertainties of @xmath38  mag .",

    "all the examined plates showed the cv to be brighter than @xmath39  mag ( @xmath40  mag ) indicating that it was in the high state .",
    "the results of our search are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the random historical observations of  from the first decades of the century showed that its brightness remained comparable to that seen on the schmidt plates  @xmath10  mag .",
    "thus , it can be assumed that this is the _ normal _ brightness of the star , i.e.  the brightness at which the star remains for most of the time .",
    "we were fortunate to observe  fading down by @xmath41  mag to its low state between january 1994 and december 1995 . in late 1996",
    "the star already seemed to be rising from the minimum . during our observations in march 1997",
    "the  brightness was fluctuating from day to day with amplitude in @xmath35 and @xmath42 of @xmath43  mag ( table  1 ) .",
    "such amplitude modulation in brightness is typical for most cvs ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the interesting feature in the low state spectra is the unusual relative strength of  balmer lines .",
    "while the spectrum from 1995 has relatively low s / n ratio , it can be clearly seen that  is the strongest emission feature .",
    "reddening towards  is not yet known in detail , however we estimate it to be @xmath44 . this estimate is based on the total extinction through the galaxy from the galactic reddening map of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) . for this reddening and the standard reddening law ( savage & mathis 1979 ) , the ratio of  and  lines is @xmath45 in 1995 , 1996 and @xmath46 in 1997 , while for the optically thin gas we would rather expect it to be around 0.3 .",
    "flat balmer decrement , implying that the balmer emission lines are optically thick , has been observed in most cvs , including intermediate polars ( horne & marsh 1986 , warner 1995 ) .",
    "we see it in the 1997 data . however , the inverted decrement , possibly present in the low state spectra , is typical for am her type of magnetic cvs and is also occasionally observed in intermediate polars ( e.g.  ex  hya , williams 1983 ; tw pic , mouchet et al .",
    "1991 ) . to achieve inverted flux ratio ,",
    "the collisional effects between @xmath47 and @xmath48 levels must be important , implying the electron density of @xmath49  @xmath50 in the line emitting regions ( stockman et al.1977 ; liebert & stockman 1985 ) .    in the spectrum from 1995",
    "there is also an evidence of strong ( 4686 ) .",
    "its strength seems to decrease as the star gets brighter and @xmath51 approaches @xmath10.5 in 1996 and 1997 .",
    "strong ( 4686 ) line has often been used as an indicator of the magnetic field . for the strong",
    "am  her systems this is a confirmed attribute ( liebert & stockman 1985 , warner 1995 ) . however , szkody ( 1995 ) pointed out that previous analyses showed that the strength in confirmed dq  hers shows a large range , from the flux much greater than  at one extreme , to zero at the other .",
    "silber ( 1986 ) found a good way to separate magnetic from non - magnetic cvs by plotting @xmath51 ratios versus the eqw of . in this plot , the systems with the ratio @xmath52 and the ewq ( )  @xmath53  20 are magnetic .",
    "since this method applies to magnetic objects in the high state we can only analyze the 1997 spectra .",
    "using @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath55 and eqw()@xmath56   .",
    "it is worth noting that the ( 4686)/  ratio is in practise not sensitive to reddening and thus it is not affected by the uncertain value of @xmath57 .",
    "clearly ,  sometimes does and sometime does not fulfill the silber s criterion for a magnetic cv .",
    "we observed  undergoing a low state .",
    "the optical brightness of the star decreased by @xmath58  mag during the interval of @xmath59 years .",
    "similar light variations are typical for magnetic cvs , both polars and intermediate polars ( garnavich & szkody 1988 ) .",
    "long term light curves of , e.g. , am  her , an  uma , and ko  vel ( feigelson , dexter & liller 1978 ; meinunger 1976 ; cropper 1986 ; mukai & corbet 1987 ) show that these systems usually stay at the maximum brightness , but occasionally experience drop to a lower brightness .",
    "the typical amplitudes are @xmath60  mag and the stars remain in the low states for few years . the significant long term reduction in optical luminosity",
    "is naturally interpreted as a lowering of the average mass transfer rate .",
    "however , other cvs that undergo similar variations are nova - like variables , of vy  scl type ( garnavich & szkody 1988 ; warner 1995 ) . with our observations we are not able to unambiguously distinguish if the low states of  point to the magnetic or the vy  scl type variations .",
    "the  and  radial velocity curves of ( figure  [ fig : radvel ] ) appear to consist of small , short fluctuations superimposed on larger sinusoidal variations .",
    "the short fluctuations seem to dominate the ( 4686 ) radial velocity curve . also , long and short fluctuations seem to be present in the hydrogen emission line fluxes , eqw and fwhm ( figure  [ fig : varemis ] ) .",
    "the rapid variations may also be seen in the ( 4686 ) line properties ( table  3 ) . however , the uncertainties are quite large and the variations are not obvious .",
    "we analyzed the whole sample of radial velocities as well as the emission line properties using monet s ( 1979 ) fourier transform algorithm ( kenyon & garcia 1986 ) and the lehmann - filhes method ( e.g.petrie 1962 ) . the best large - amplitude modulations that we found had a timescale of @xmath61  h. the period of @xmath62  h was present in both ,  and , radial velocity curves , as well as in the intensities .",
    "the  intensities had shorter period of @xmath63  h , while eqw of  and  had a longer period of @xmath64  h. however , they all agree with the 4  h fluctuations .",
    "we have to mention that the periods we found are close to the characteristic length of our data sets , and as such have to be taken with caution .",
    "we also do not have enough data to fold them with this period .",
    "more observations are needed to confirm the longer modulations .",
    "the periodogram analysis of the ( 4686 ) radial velocity curve showed evidence of the period of @xmath65  min and the longer period of @xmath66  h supporting the 4  h modulations found earlier .",
    "similarly , @xmath2  min fluctuations were found in the flux .",
    "we were not able to look for shorter variations as the time resolution of our data only allows us to see variations with characteristic timescales of tens of minutes .",
    "no other significant periods were found in the data .",
    "the continuum magnitude light curves do not show any obvious periodical modulations .",
    "superposition of longer and shorter periods in the  data , where the longer modulations can not be described in detail , does not allow us to subtract it and search more carefully for the shorter period in residuals .",
    "future observations of  may provide us with better data for more detailed periodogram analysis .",
    "similar long and short variations are characteristic for intermediate polars .",
    "high quality , timed - resolved spectroscopic studies of e.g.ex  hya ( hellier et al .",
    "1987 ) , fo  aqr ( hellier , mason & cropper 1990 ; martell & keitchuck 1991 ) , ao  psc ( hellier , cropper & mason 1991 ) , showed complex structure of the emission lines .",
    "the radial velocities of the balmer lines can be dominated by the s - wave component following the orbital period , while the ( 4686 ) line radial velocities show variations with a rotational period of a magnetic white dwarf or a beat period .",
    "the short modulations also appear in the fluxes and eqw of the emission lines .",
    "assuming that the detected @xmath14  hr period corresponds to the orbital period , and the 50  min pulses to the rotational period of the primary we can put some constraints on the system parameters .",
    "fitting circular orbit to the radial velocities yields large scatter in the systemic velocities , @xmath67 .",
    "semi - amplitudes range from @xmath68  for  up to @xmath69  for  and ( 4686 ) .",
    "the radial velocities of the balmer lines have been commonly used for the spectroscopic orbit determination for many cvs ( see e.g.dobrzycka & howell 1992 ) . however , in non - magnetic cvs the emission usually originates in the outer parts of the accretion disk and do not therefore trace accurately the orbital motion of the white dwarf . in magnetic cvs the balmer lines usually originate in gas falling down towards the accretion zone ( polars ) or in the hot spot ( intermediate polars ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : contmags ] shows the continuum magnitude light curves obtained for  on march 05 , 1997 .",
    "at the end of our observing sequence the continuum brightness decreased at all wavelengths and it appears as if the system was about to enter an eclipse .",
    "we estimated following drops of brightness : @xmath70  mag , @xmath71  mag , @xmath72  mag , and @xmath73  mag .",
    "this suggests that continuum was getting redder what could indicate possible eclipse of the white dwarf by the secondary .",
    "the h  i emission lines weaken , but do not disappear completely , while at the same time the he  ii line becomes hardly visible .",
    "if what we observe is a real primary eclipse then the radial velocities of the balmer lines are out of phase , which suggests that they follow the orbital motion of the secondary , and not of the white dwarf . the radial velocity curve of ( 4686 )",
    "is dominated by the short fluctuation and analysis of the orbital variations is very unreliable .",
    "another conclusion that can be drawn from the assumption that  is an eclipsing binary is that the inclination angle of the system s orbit , @xmath74 , is close to @xmath75 .",
    "since all derived semi - amplitudes agree within errors we adopt average value of @xmath76  in further considerations . in view of above discussion",
    "we want to emphasize that determination of system parameters for  is uncertain and give us only rough estimates . applying adopted values , @xmath77  h , @xmath76  and @xmath78 , to the mass function equation , @xmath79 ^ 2 \\sin^3i$ ] we find @xmath80 . for an average mass of the white dwarfs in magnetic cvs with @xmath81  h , @xmath82 ( webbink 1990 )",
    "we obtain mass ratio @xmath83 and thus @xmath84 .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the @xmath85 calculated from the mean empirical mass - period relationship @xmath86 ( warner 1995 ) .    in the intermediate polars",
    "the accretion disk extends outward from the magnetosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "the magnetosphere is defined by the _",
    "alfvn radius _ , at which the pressure exerted by the infalling material is balanced by the magnetic pressure . assuming spherical , free - fall accretion , the alfvn radius can be written as @xmath87  cm , where @xmath88 is the mass accretion rate in units of @xmath89  g  s@xmath20 , @xmath90 is expressed in @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the magnetic moment in units of @xmath93  g  @xmath94 ( frank , king & raine 1992 ) .",
    "the magnetic moment is specified by the white dwarf surface field strength , @xmath35 , and is expressed with @xmath95 . for typical @xmath96  g  s@xmath20 and @xmath6  g",
    "we obtain @xmath97  cm if we use @xmath98 and the white dwarf radius of @xmath99  cm .",
    "as the accreting gas finds its way inside the alfvn radius , it produces shock heated region on the inner edge of the disk .",
    "after that , the matter flows along the magnetic field lines towards the magnetic poles of the white dwarf .",
    "if the base of the accretion stream on the alfvn radius remains fixed with respect to the disk then the heated region will rotate with the keplerian velocity of the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the detected 50  min period corresponds to the radius of a keplerian orbit @xmath100  cm , which agrees very well with estimated alfvn radius .",
    "we can compare it with the semiamplitude of the white dwarf s orbit @xmath101  cm ; the alfvn radius lies well within it .",
    "we observed a new cataclysmic binary .",
    "our analysis of spectroscopic and historic photometric data showed that this object may be a candidate for the intermediate polar .",
    "we observed  undergoing a low state lasting @xmath102  yr . during the minimum of its activity the stellar brightness dropped by @xmath103  mag ; such low states are common among am  her and dq  her systems .",
    "the periodogram analysis of the ,  and ( 4686 ) radial velocities revealed that the hydrogen lines are likely dominated by the s - wave component , following the orbital variations with @xmath104  hr , while ( 4686 ) shows rapid fluctuations with @xmath105  min .",
    "similar long- and short - term variations were present in the emission line fluxes and eqw .",
    "adopting 4  hr modulation as the  orbital period we obtain the mass function @xmath106 , and , after some reasonable assumptions , we put some constraints on the system parameters : @xmath107 , @xmath83 , @xmath108 .",
    "the 50  min period very likely corresponds to the white dwarf s alfvn radius @xmath109  m.    polars and intermediate polars are known to be relatively bright x - ray sources , although there are several objects that have not been detected in x - rays ( patterson 1994 ) . to our knowledge , no x - ray sources were detected on the position of , including the rosat all sky survey ( greiner & voges 1997 ) .",
    "hs0551 + 7241 appears to be a very interesting object .",
    "more uv / optical / ir and polarimetric observations are needed to derive accurately the system parameters , characterize properties of the white dwarf and the red dwarf companion , and to probe the magnetic nature of the system .",
    "future pointed x - ray observations could provide us with additional informations about the short signal modulations and put more light on the physical properties of the primary .",
