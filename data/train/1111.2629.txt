    "the properties of transport through small conducting islands have been investigated extensively during the past years .",
    "electric current in such devices flows due to tunneling of single electrons and is subject to the so - called coulomb blockade effect  @xcite which is characterized by a new energy scale , the capacitive charging energy @xmath2 of the island ( see below ) . in the recent past",
    ", substantial attention has been devoted also to thermoelectric effects in single - electron devices  @xcite .",
    "single - electron devices are interesting candidates for thermoelectric applications as it has long been known that dimensional reduction of the electron dynamics may lead to an enhanced thermoelectric efficiency  @xcite . while an immense amount of work has been done to investigate thermopower for quantum dots , surprisingly little is known about the thermoelectric effects in single - electron transistors ( set ) with superconducting electrodes . in particular , set with superconducting islands are interesting as they may exhibit the _ parity effect _ where a single unpaired quasiparticle determines the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the island electrode  @xcite as well as the current - voltage characteristics of set with normal - conducting electrodes and a superconducting island ( nsn set )  @xcite .",
    "the parity effect can be observed below a crossover temperature @xmath3 for typical system parameters ( here @xmath0 is the energy gap of the superconductor ) .",
    "one may expect that the peculiar combination of properties like several competing energy scales ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) and the presence of a singularity in the quasiparticle spectrum gives rise to interesting behavior in the thermoelectric response of such systems .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the thermopower for an nsn set was studied for @xmath5 and @xmath6 . even for this regime without parity effect ,",
    "interesting oscillations of the thermopower as a function of the electrostatic island potential and their strong dependence on the ratio @xmath7 were predicted . in this article , we investigate the thermopower of nsn set for temperatures below the crossover temperature .",
    "we find that the interplay of energy scales , coulomb - blockade and parity effects , and the peculiarity of the electronic spectrum lead to a rich variety of features in the thermopower @xmath8 .",
    "most intriguingly , however , for certain gate voltages this system displays a dramatic enhancement of the thermoelectric efficiency quantified by the figure of merit @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce the setup and the theoretical methods that are used to describe transport in such systems .",
    "subsequently we briefly review the parity effect in set with superconducting islands .",
    "we then turn to describe the results for the thermopower , and to interpret them in terms of average transport energies .",
    "finally we discuss the surprising results for the figure of merit @xmath1 which we explain in the frame of a simple re - interpretation of this quantity .",
    "in an nsn set , a superconducting island with a small electrostatic capacitance @xmath9 is connected via tunnel junctions to two normal - conducting leads ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) .",
    "the corresponding charging energy @xmath10 is large compared to the temperatures under consideration ( here , @xmath11 denotes the elementary charge ) .",
    "the conductances of the tunnel junctions are assumed to be small compared to @xmath12 , so sequential tunneling dominates and cotunneling effects may be neglected .",
    "the electrostatic potential of the island can be controlled by means of an external potential @xmath13 due to the gate voltage @xmath14 , and the electrostatic energy of the setup with @xmath15 excess electrons on the island can be expressed as @xmath16 the energy cost for adding a single electron to the island is @xmath17 while to add two electrons , an energy @xmath18 is required .",
    "a current may flow in the device if a bias voltage @xmath19 and/or a temperature difference @xmath20 is applied . throughout this work we consider the linear - response regime , that is , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "linear transport of charge and heat is conveniently described in terms of the equations @xmath23 which relate the charge and heat current response , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , to an applied potential and temperature difference . here , @xmath26 is the linear ( charge ) conductance , and the thermal conductance @xmath27 is defined via @xmath28 for @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 .",
    "the relevant quantity for the thermoelectric response is the thermopower @xmath8 , given by @xmath31 . in order to calculate the the conductances @xmath26 , @xmath32 and the thermopower @xmath8 we employ a master - equation formalism . according to the orthodox theory  @xcite",
    "charge and heat current through the system can be written as @xmath33 \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : qcurrent } i_q & = &    \\sum_n\\sum_{j=1,2 }                   p_n \\left [ q_r^{\\ , n\\to n - j } -                               q_r^{\\ , n\\to n+j }                      \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the stationary probability for finding @xmath15 excess electrons on the island , @xmath35 is the tunneling rate of @xmath36 electrons from the island to the right lead , and @xmath37 denotes the tunneling rate of @xmath36 electrons from the right lead to the island .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath38 is the energy transfer rate in @xmath36-electron tunneling to the right lead whereas @xmath38 denotes the energy transfer rate in a @xmath36-electron tunneling event from the right lead to the island .",
    "we consider only sequential tunneling and neglect co - tunneling events .    in eqs .",
    ", we have taken into account the possibility of single - electron tunneling ( @xmath39 ) and coherent two - electron tunneling ( @xmath40 )  @xcite .",
    "the rates for the latter process are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the andreev conductances in the left and the right junction and @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the energies which are dissipated in a two - electron transfer , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath46 .",
    "the energy transfer rate for two - electron tunneling is then obtained as @xmath47 where the reference point is the fermi level of the leads .",
    "the rates for single - electron transitions are given by a sum of two contributions .",
    "on the one hand , we have the standard expressions for tunneling , _",
    "e.g. _ , from a normal to a superconductor  @xcite @xmath48\\   , \\",
    "i = l,\\ r\\ ] ] ( where @xmath49 denotes the fermi function with the appropriate temperature @xmath50 , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 for the leads or the island , respectively ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is the _ escape _ rate of a single unpaired quasiparticle whose energy equals that of @xmath0  @xcite @xmath53 with the normal - electron density of states per spin on the island @xmath54 . note that there is also a corresponding recombination rate . in many cases these escape rates can be neglected , however , at very low temperatures they may exceed the subgap tunneling rate originating from thermally excited quasiparticles in the superconductor . in that case",
    ", they produces a different macroscopic behavior of the system , depending on whether the total charge number on the island is even or odd .",
    "thus we have @xmath55 where , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath56 .",
    "finally , the corresponding energy transfer rates for single - electron tunneling are found from @xmath57\\ ] ] and @xmath58 ( where again the reference point is the lead fermi level ) such that we have @xmath59 in order to calculate the currents  , we solve the stationary master equation for the probabilities @xmath34 @xmath60 for an applied ( small ) bias voltage @xmath61 or a ( small ) temperature difference @xmath62 . if a voltage or temperature difference is applied the island is , strictly speaking , in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "for the given physical situation it is reasonable to neglect the non - equilibrium part of the distribution function ( which we have already done by writing the transfer rates in the form above ) .",
    "for the temperature @xmath52 of the island we assume the arithmetic mean @xmath63 .",
    "we note that there is an independent test of the numerical calculation by checking the onsager relation @xmath64 for the coefficients in eq .   which is obeyed to a high accuracy by our method .",
    "as mentioned above , the parity effect arises as a macroscopic manifestation of the parity of the electron number in a superconductor , _",
    "i.e. _ , different behavior depending on whether the total electron number is even or odd . the effect was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and first observed by tinkham _ et .",
    "@xcite .    in an even - number superconductor at @xmath65",
    "all electrons near the fermi level are bound in cooper pairs and there is not a single unpaired quasiparticle left .",
    "this system has an energy gap @xmath66 . on the other hand , adding _",
    "one _ electron results in a single quasiparticle excitation which which does not have an excitation gap .",
    "however , the response to an external field is drastically reduced as it is caused just by a single electron .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the difference between the two parities will fade away as soon as there are more thermal quasiparticles .",
    "this defines the criterion for a crossover temperature @xmath4 beyond which even - odd differences disappear for an isolated superconductor such as the island in the nsn set : it is the temperature at which there is on average one thermally excite quasiparticle and it is defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68 can be viewed as an effective number of accessible quasiparticle states at the temperature @xmath52 .",
    "superconducting islands in set are made of aluminum , and for typical parameters ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) one has @xmath69 and @xmath70mk .    keeping in mind that an set has the characteristic energy scale @xmath2 , there arise four interesting transport regimes : for the gap and the charging energy we may have @xmath5 or @xmath71 .",
    "these two cases may be studied for @xmath72 ( no parity effects ) or in the parity regime @xmath73 .",
    "interestingly , with our numerical method we have a choice for studying the system with parity effects . for computations at high temperatures",
    "@xmath72 it does not matter whether or not the two - electron and escape rates are included , they do not give any observable effect .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath74 even - odd differences can not be observed without including these rates .",
    "therefore , including or not including these rates in calculations below @xmath75 helps us to identify the contribution due to the parity - generating processes .",
    "before we discuss our results we briefly recall an idea due to matveev  @xcite ( cf .  also  @xcite ) to interpret the thermopower as an average energy @xmath76 at which current is transported in the voltage - biased system ( under linear transport conditions ) .",
    "this is an intuitive and powerful method which will use throughout our work to interpret our results .",
    "the idea can be understood by taking into account that the current @xmath24 through a device can be written as @xmath77w(\\xi){\\mathrm d}\\xi$ ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the fermi functions in the left and right lead for the respective potential and temperature ( the energies @xmath80 are taken with respect to the chemical potentials ) . here",
    "@xmath81 includes all other quantities such as density of states in the leads and transparency of the device at the energy @xmath80 . by noting that @xmath82 and @xmath83 one finds @xmath84 and consequently for the thermopower @xmath85 that is , up to a factor the thermopower measures directly this average energy @xmath76 .    let us turn now to our calculations for the thermopower of nsn set . for the numerics we measure energy and inverse time in units of @xmath2 , and conductance in units of @xmath86 .",
    "then , the free parameters are the ratios of the conductances @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and the escape rates @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the realistic parameter values which enter our calculations are : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93ev , @xmath94 . the experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite have been carried out with device parameters close to these values .      in fig .",
    "2 we show the results for calculations of the thermopower with and without parity effects . the functional dependence @xmath95 in the latter case has been explained analytically in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as we have @xmath96 it is sufficient to include two ( or at most three ) charge states in the considerations in order to understand the behavior of @xmath95 .",
    "here we focus on a brief discussion of the additional features in the parity regime @xmath74 .",
    "= 0.43    [ fig2 ]    the key to understand the functional dependence of @xmath95 without even - odd effects is that at the points @xmath97 , that is , when @xmath98 takes half - integer values tunneling to the island @xmath99 and from the island @xmath100 occurs with equal probability . by using simple arguments for the probabilities @xmath34 and @xmath101",
    "the following equation has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath102 \\right)\\ ] ] which governs the behavior of @xmath95 in the intervals from @xmath103 to the zeros of @xmath95 which are closest to those @xmath98 values .    by inspecting fig .",
    "2 we note that the essential difference introduced in the parity regime is that the purple curve is shifted from the half - integer values of @xmath98 towards the closest even number .",
    "as the slope of the curve does not change in this shift , the consequence is that the maximum absolute value of @xmath8 increases , compared to the case without parity .",
    "it is not difficult to describe this behavior analytically by repeating the arguments that lead to eq .",
    ", now taking into account that the recombination rate of quasiparticles on the island is no longer @xmath104 . in this range of @xmath98",
    "there is an unpaired quasiparticle on the island whose recombination rate provides the dominating contribution to the charge current .",
    "this rate is @xmath105 . from this",
    "we get a modified relation @xmath106 \\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath107                  } $ ] .",
    "the relation   captures the essential features of the purple curve in fig .  2 .",
    "the green dashed line in fig .",
    "3 shows an example for the thermopower without parity effects for @xmath71 .",
    "the arguments we have given in the preceding subsection for the thermopower at half - integer values of @xmath98 are valid also in this case .",
    "that is , eq .",
    "correctly describes the behavior of the function @xmath95 also in this parameter range .",
    "hence , this equation turns out to be the key for understanding the thermopower in nsn set , _",
    "i.e. _ , a device with an electronic spectrum that is gapped around the fermi energy .",
    "we further mention that for the thermopower without parity effects for the average energy close to integer values of @xmath108 one has @xmath109 which yields @xmath110    = 0.43    [ fig3 ]    if the gap exceeds the charging energy , two - electron tunneling starts to play a prominent role for the current - voltage characteristics of nsn set in the parity regime @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "around odd - integer values of @xmath98 there occurs a current peak which is due to a cycle of two - electron tunneling processes .",
    "note that these processes do not have a gap .",
    "the thermopower is analogous to that of single - electron tunneling in nnn set , the only difference is that we have to substitute the charging energy difference for two - electron tunneling , @xmath111 which leads to a thermopower @xmath112 .",
    "this result curiously coincides with the one in the absence of parity effects , eq .",
    "although the dominating tunneling process is a different one .    in the vicinity of the half - integer values of @xmath98",
    "we observe the analogous effect to the case @xmath5 : the curve gets shifted towards the closest even - integer @xmath98 without changing the slope .",
    "scrutiny of the dominating current - carrying processes , _",
    "e.g. _ , for @xmath113 reveals that also here the largest rate is due to quasiparticle recombination on the island .",
    "however , if @xmath74 there are essentially no thermal quasiparticles .",
    "there is only a _",
    "single _ unpaired electron which is left from the pair - breaking tunneling off the island .",
    "the quantitative description of this recombination process leads in full analogy to the conclusion of the previous subsection , namely that eq .",
    "describes this shift of the curve .",
    "the essence also here is that the current is due to tunneling of a single unpaired quasiparticle .",
    "once we have studied the thermopower of the nsn set it is an interesting question to investigate the thermoelectric efficiency of this device .",
    "this efficiency is quantified by @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 denote the electronic and lattice contribution to the heat conductance of the device .",
    "our work focuses on a regime of extremely low temperatures for which @xmath116 is very small , hence we neglect it and @xmath117 .",
    "we compute @xmath27 from the heat current @xmath25 according to eqs .  .",
    "an example of the results is shown in fig .  4 .",
    "for @xmath118 we observe huge values of @xmath1 which is rather uncommon , keeping in mind that typical    = 0.43    [ fig4 ]    values for materials reach the order of 1 , or for quantum dots the order of @xmath119 .",
    "the question is why such high values are possible for this system .",
    "a quick answer might be that , given that superconductors are bad heat conductors , it could be expected that by including the superconducting island @xmath1 of a single - electron transistor would be enhanced .",
    "let us try to give a more quantitative answer which takes into account our observations from the previous section .    by transferring matveev s idea for the interpretation of @xmath8 as an average transport energy of the electrons according to eq .",
    "we can derive an expression that illuminates the meaning of @xmath1 .",
    "in analogy with eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath120 .",
    "this leads , together with eq .   and",
    "@xmath30 , to the new relation @xmath121 indeed , all additional factors cancel and @xmath1 turns out to be the ratio of the squared average transport energy and the variance of that energy .",
    "this relation clearly indicates the strategy that needs to be used in order to increase @xmath1 : the current - carrying electrons should be far from the fermi energy while their energetic distribution should be as narrow as possible .",
    "this corroborates also the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that a @xmath122 function in the spectrum is favorable for a high @xmath1 value .",
    "let us now apply eq .   to the nsn set .",
    "we have already discussed that for the @xmath98 values where the strong enhancement of @xmath1 is found , the current is carried by a single unpaired quasiparticle .",
    "the maximum energy of this quasiparticle is @xmath123 while its energy distribution is rather narrow : it is just given by the temperature @xmath52 .",
    "hence we expect @xmath124 .",
    "in fact , this estimate has the correct order of magnitude .",
    "we have investigated the thermopower for a single - electron transistor with a superconducting island for arbitrary ratios @xmath7 and for temperatures both above and below the crossover temperature for parity effects @xmath75 .",
    "the results show the expected parity effects also in the functional dependence @xmath95 of the thermopower on the gate charge @xmath98 , in particular @xmath125 periodicity . we have provided a discussion of the essential features of this functional dependence in terms of eqs .  , .",
    "it is remarkable that the basis for this discussion is eq .   which was found already in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "apart from the thermopower we have also calculated the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath1 .",
    "unexpectedly we have found a strong enhancement of @xmath1 compared to common values of this quantity . in order to understand our findings",
    "we have given a new interpretation of @xmath1 in terms of matveev s idea to represent thermoelectric quantities as moments of the energy distribution for the current - carrying electrons .",
    "it shows that large values of @xmath1 can be obtained if the dominant transport mechanism occurs far from the fermi level , and at the same time , has a narrow distribution in its energies .",
    "clearly , the nsn set is a system where these conditions can be achieved .",
