    "the wave function of the bound state of quark and antiquark is determined by the strong interaction between quark and antiquarks .",
    "the study of the wave functions of heavy - flavored mesons like @xmath2 and @xmath0 are important not only for studying the property of strong interaction between heavy and light quarks , but also for investigating the mechanism of heavy meson decays .",
    "the wave function determines the momentum distributions of the quark and antiquark in mesons , which is an important quantity for calculating the amplitude of heavy meson decays @xcite .",
    "the light - cone momentum distribution amplitudes for @xmath2 meson appear in the amplitude of @xmath2 decays , which are defined through the hadron - to - vacuum matrix element of non - local operators of quark and antiquark separated along the light - cone @xmath3 .",
    "the light - cone distribution amplitudes of @xmath2 meson have been extensively studied in the recent several years .",
    "some properties of the light - cone distribution amplitudes have been obtained .",
    "based on these achievements , several models satisfying these constraints have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "methods to obtain the light - cone distribution amplitude exactly from the first principle of qcd are still under investigation .",
    "alternatively , directly studying the wave functions of the heavy mesons by solving the bound state wave equation is an effective way to obtain the knowledge about the bound state of quark and antiquark @xcite . for a heavy - light system , in the heavy quark limit , the heavy quark can be viewed as a static color source in the rest frame of the heavy meson .",
    "the light antiquark is bound around the heavy quark by an effective potential .",
    "the heavy quark spin decouples from the interactions as @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the mass of the heavy quark ) @xcite . the interactions relevant to quark spin can be treated as perturbative correction .    inspired by asymptotic freedom at short distance in qcd and quark confinement at long distance",
    ", the effective potential between quark and antiquark in meson can be taken as a combination of a coulomb term and a linear confining term .",
    "such a potential will be consistent with perturbative qcd at short distance , it can also generate quark confinement at long distance @xcite .    the parameters in the effective potential can be constrained by comparing the eigenvalues of the bound state wave equation with the masses of the relevant bound states measured in experiment .",
    "recently the decay constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons have been measured by cleo @xcite , belle @xcite and _ babar _ @xcite collaborations .",
    "the measured values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons decay constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 can give further information about the interactions within the heavy - light quark - antiquark system . in this paper , with the recently measured decay constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 available , we revisit the study of the bound states of @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in the relativistic potential model .",
    "we solve the relativistic version of schrdinger equation for the bound state wave function of heavy - light quark - antiquark meson system .",
    "the decay constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be used as a further constriant on the parameters in the potential model .",
    "the obtained masses and decay constants of @xmath2 and @xmath0 mesons can be well consistent with the values measured in experiments .",
    "then the wave functions obtained here can be more reliable then ever .",
    "it can be useful for studying @xmath2 and @xmath0 decays , where the momentum - distribution of the quarks is needed .",
    "although the bound states of heavy mesons have been studied with the relativistic potential model in the literature several years before , these works need to be improved with the recent experimental data of the decay constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons available .",
    "the decay constants and bound state masses are calculated in refs.@xcite , where richardson potential @xcite was taken , here the potential we considered is different from theirs . in addition , with the experimental values of the decay constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 available recently , the parameters in the potential can be constrained more stringently . therefore our prediction on the decay constants for @xmath2 and @xmath0 mesons are quite different from previous predictions in the relativistic potential model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we solve the relativistic wave equation for the heavy - light quark - antiquark system . section iii gives the decay constant in terms of the wave function . in section",
    "iv the qcd - inspired potential is presented .",
    "section v is devoted to the numerical result and discussion .",
    "section vi is a brief summary .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath0 mesons are assumed to be approximately described in terms of heavy - light valence - quark configurations in the rest - frame of the mesons .",
    "the effective potential is one - gluon exchange dominant at short distances and a linear confinement at long distances @xcite .",
    "the equation describing the bound state wave functions is a schrdinger - type wave equation with relativistic dynamics @xcite @xmath9\\psi(\\vec{r})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{1cm}=e\\psi(\\vec{r } ) , \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the displacement of the light antiquark from the heavy quark , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the coordinates of the light and heavy quarks respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the gradient operators relevant to the coordinates of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath15 is the mass of the light antiquark , and @xmath16 the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "@xmath17 is the effective potential of strong interaction between heavy and light quark - antiquark . in the rest frame of the bound state system , the eigenvalues in the wave equation",
    "will be the masses of the series bound states .",
    "the wave function can be expressed in terms of spectrum integration @xmath18 substitute eq.([e2 ] ) into eq.([e1 ] ) , the wave equation becomes @xmath19 the exponential @xmath20 can be decomposed in spherical harmonics @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spherical bessel function , @xmath23 is the spherical harmonics , which satisfies the normalization condition @xmath24 using the spherical harmonics decomposition of the exponential in eq.([e4 ] ) , and factorize the wave function into the product of two parts : radial and angular wave functions @xmath25 then the wave equation of eq.([e3 ] ) can be transferred to be @xmath26 for convenience later , let us define a new reduced radial wave function @xmath27 by @xmath28 with this definition , and for the case @xmath29 which we are interested in this work , eq.([e7 ] ) becomes @xmath30 where we have used the explicit expression of the spherical bessel function for @xmath29 @xmath31 eq.([e9 ] ) is for taking @xmath32 , if recover the speed of light appearing in the formulas , eq.([e9 ] ) should be @xmath33 in principle the integration over momentum @xmath34 in the above equation can be performed because the wave function @xmath35 does not depend on the momentum .",
    "however the integration over @xmath34 will give a singular term for @xmath36 in the above equation @xcite .",
    "in this work , we will take a new step to continue to solve this equation , this method can circumvent the appearance of the singular integral equation .    for a bound state of two particles , when the separation between them is large enough , the wave function will effectively vanish .",
    "we assume such a large enough typical value for the separation between the heavy quark and the light antiquark is @xmath37 , then the quark - antiquark in the bound state can be approximately treated as if they are restricted in a limited space @xmath38 . in the limited space ,",
    "the fourier expansion of the reduced wave function @xmath39 is @xmath40 where the expansion coefficients @xmath41 are @xmath42 in the limited space , the momentum @xmath34 should be discretized , the integration over @xmath34 should be replaced by a summation , the following substitution should be made in the wave equation ( [ e11 ] ) @xmath43 with the above replacement , and the integration over the distance @xmath44 being limited within @xmath45 , eq.([e11 ] ) becomes @xmath46 the above equation can go back to eq.([e11 ] ) as @xmath47 .",
    "numerically if the value of @xmath37 is taken to be large enough , the solution of this equation only slightly depends on the value of @xmath37 . for the parameters we take in section v , we find that the solution of the wave equation will be stationary when @xmath48 .",
    "truncate the series of the fourier expansion of the wave function @xmath39 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a large integer .",
    "substitute this truncated expansion into the wave equation ( [ e15 ] ) and simplify it , one can finally get the equation about @xmath41 @xmath51 the above equation is just the eigenstate equation in the matrix form .",
    "it is not difficult to solve it numerically .",
    "the eigenvalues are the masses of the series of bound states of the heavy - light quark - antiquark system .",
    "once the eigen equation is solved , the eigenvectors composed of @xmath41 can be substituted into eq.([e16 ] ) to get the reduced wave function @xmath39 .    to get the wave function in momentum space",
    ", one can use the fourier transform of the wave function @xmath52 @xmath53 separate the variable - dependence of the momentum - space wave function as @xmath54 as in eq.([e8 ] ) , we define the reduced wave function in momentum space @xmath55 then using eqs.([e4 ] ) , ( [ e6 ] ) , ( [ e8 ] ) , ( [ e19 ] ) and ( [ e20 ] ) , one can derive from eq.([e18 ] ) @xmath56 for the case @xmath29 , we get @xmath57 which gives the momentum distribution of the quark and antiquark in the rest frame of the heavy meson .",
    "the pseudoscalar meson composed of a heavy quark and a light antiquark @xmath58 ( @xmath59 can be @xmath60 or @xmath61 quark , @xmath62 stands for @xmath63 , @xmath64 or @xmath65 quark ) can be written in the meson rest frame as follows @xmath66|0\\rangle , \\label{e23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the color index .",
    "the factor @xmath68 is the normalization factor for color indices , and @xmath69 the normalization factor for spin indices .",
    "the normalization of the meson state is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the energy of the meson .    substituting eq.([e23 ] ) into eq.([e24 ] ) , we can finally get the normalization condition of the wave function in momentum space @xmath72    the decay constant of a pseudoscalar is defined by the hadron - to - vacuum matrix element of the axial current @xmath73 substituting the meson state of eq.([e23 ] ) into the above equation in the rest frame , and contracting the quark ( antiquark ) creation operators in the meson state with quark ( antiquark ) annihilation operators in the quark field of the axial current , we can get the expression of the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the energy of the heavy and light quarks . to be consistent with the wave equation , here",
    "both heavy and light quarks are taken to be on - shell .",
    "we assume that the decays of the heavy meson can be approximately described in terms of on - shell valence quarks , although the sum of the four - momenta of the valence quarks are not equal to that of the meson because of the existence of the color field within the hadron which can carry both energy and momentum .",
    "we would like to mention that the leptonic decay of pseudoscalar mesons was considered several decades ago in a different method by assuming the coupling of meson with quark - antiquark pair @xcite .",
    "the potential of strong interaction between the heavy quark and light antiquark is taken as a combination of a coulomb term and a linear confining term inspired by qcd @xcite @xmath77 the first term is the coulomb term , which is consistent with one - gluon - exchange contribution for short distance calculated in perturbative qcd . the second term is the linear - confinement term , which generates confinement in long distance . the third term is a phenomenological constant , which is needed to reproduce the correct masses for heavy - light meson system .    the running coupling constant @xmath78 in momentum space with @xmath79 quark flavors at large values of @xmath80 , calculated in lowest - order qcd , is @xmath81 this behavior of the strong coupling can be parameterized in a simpler form which can be conveniently transformed into the @xmath82-space @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 are free parameters chosen to fit the behavior of @xmath78 given by perturbative qcd ( eq.([e29 ] ) ) . as @xmath85 , the coupling @xmath78 diverges , which is believed to be a signal of confinement .",
    "however , as @xmath85 , perturbative qcd can not apply , the behavior of @xmath78 at small @xmath80 given in eq.([e29 ] ) can not be the exact prediction of qcd .",
    "one can make other choice for the behavior of the strong coupling at small momentum transfer . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the coupling @xmath86 saturate as a critical value @xmath87 , where @xmath88 . in practice ,",
    "only several @xmath84 are needed to be non - zero , which can fit the behavior of @xmath78 well at perturbative region , deviation only occurs at small @xmath80 .    the transformation of @xmath78 by using eq .",
