    "on march 12 , 2001 a large number of condensed matter physicists gathered for a technical session at the american physical society march meeting in seattle to share their results and thoughts on the newly discovered superconductivity in a simple binary compound , magnesium diboride ( mgb@xmath0 ) . for somewhat nostalgic reasons ( in memory of so - called `` woodstock of physics '' in 1987 , where the discovery and first studies of superconducting cuprates were discussed ) this session was quickly dubbed `` woodstock west '' . as in the case of superconducting cuprates ,",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 @xcite was serendipitous : the compound itself was known , @xcite and even synthesized in single - crystalline form , @xcite decades earlier .",
    "we can only conjecture that since this material appeared not to fulfill the preconcieved notion of what high temperature superconductivity should look like , the proper experimental test for a possible superconducting ground state was not performed .",
    "the specific heat capacity of magnesium diboride was measured and tabulated from @xmath1 k to @xmath2 k , through the temperature that now we know to be its @xmath3 , but no feature that could be associated with a transition was reported .",
    "@xcite all in all , magnesium diboride was waiting almost 50 years for its moment , if not in `` the sun '' , then at least in the cryostat .",
    "( as an aside , in a similar way , ba- and sr- doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath4 cuprates were synthesized and described , @xcite but not cooled down below 78 k , almost a decade before the high temperature superconductivity in these materials was discovered .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity with @xmath5 k in magnesium diboride caused initial excitement and hopes .",
    "very quickly @xmath6 curves that exceeded those of nb@xmath7sn were achieved ( fig .",
    "[ hc2com ] ) and a `` mgb@xmath0 zone of use '' around 20 k was delineated .",
    "indeed , in few years the physics of this material was considered understood and applied research efforts took up the arduous task of furter improving critical current dencity , @xmath8 , as well as wire development .    in this brief review",
    "we summarize , mostly experimental , knowledge about superconductivity in magnesium diboride with more attention to the basic physical properties of bulk samples .",
    "mgb@xmath0 films will be mentioned only briefly , for details an interested reader can inquire several general and more specialized reviews .",
    "@xcite an interested reader will be able to find a number of in - depth discussions of specific topics related to superconductivity of magnesium diboride in two special issues of _ physica c _ @xcite and in a number of reviews scattered in different sources , @xcite as well as more general , `` popular science '' reviews.@xcite",
    "mgb@xmath0 forms in the hexagonal , alb@xmath0 - type structure ( space group : _ p6/mmm _ ) with the lattice parameters @xmath9   and @xmath10  .",
    "@xcite in this structure the characteristic graphite - like two - dimensional layers formed by boron atoms sandwich the triangular mg layers forming the structure similar to the intercalated graphite .",
    "number of other metal - diborides are formed in the same structure .",
    "details of chemical bonding in these materials are briefly surveyed by spear @xcite .",
    "bulk polycrystalline mgb@xmath0 can readily synthesized by exposing solid boron to mg vapor at elevated temperatures , @xcite that is very close to the approach used in the initial publications on mgb@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite mgb@xmath0 forms as a line compound @xcite with possible mg vacancies of , at most , less than one percent .",
    "@xcite so to make stoichiometric mgb@xmath0 one needs to mix magnesium and boron in 1 to 2 molar ratio and heat above the melting point of magnesium ( @xmath11 c ) , although often higher temperatures , @xmath12 c are used . as mgb@xmath0 is the most magnesium rich of all stable mg - b binary phases , @xcite to ensure complete reaction",
    ", it is possible to use excess of magnesium .",
    "this approach provides a form preserving method of turning boron objects ( filaments , films , tapes ) into mgb@xmath0 objects with similar morphologies .",
    "@xcite the properties of resultant mgb@xmath0 ( resistivity , @xmath3 , upper critical field , etc . ) can vary depending upon presence of impurities , in particular in boron . @xcite    despite serious efforts of several groups there was no obvious success in growing mgb@xmath0 single crystals of significant size ( larger than few @xmath13 m ) at ambient pressure .",
    "the only viable technique for single crystal growth is high pressure synthesis .",
    "crystals with dimensions up to @xmath14 mm@xmath15 and mass in excess of 200 @xmath13 g can be grown under high pressure .",
    "the mg - b phase diagram under pressure of 45 kbar @xcite contains a eutectic at mg : b @xmath16 with a temperature slightly above 550@xmath17 c. this phase diagram presents the possibility of mgb@xmath0 single crystal growth from solution at temperatures up to @xmath18 c. since in real experiments @xcite the synthesis is performed in a bn container which reacts with the melt at high temperatures ( and pressures ) , the reaction in the ternary mg - b - n system should be considered .",
    "synchrotron studies of the mgb@xmath0 formation under pressure was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , overviews of the mgb@xmath0 single crystal growth under pressure were given in several publications .",
    "@xcite    there were a number of attempts at partial replacement of mg and b in mgb@xmath0 by different elements . to judge the veracity of such claims , a set of three criteria known as `` bob",
    "s rules '' was suggested @xcite : ( 1 ) second phases should not grow systematically in proportion with increasing dopant concentration ; ( 2 ) a shift of the lattice parameters by more than three standard deviations in the series of doped samples should be seen ; ( 3 ) properties of the superconductor should change on doping .",
    "the applicability of these criteria is not limited to substitution in mgb@xmath0 , but , in our opinion , should be considered in any study that involves chemical substitution . of the attempts of substitution in mgb@xmath0 , only three are generally accepted as successful at this point : mg(b@xmath19c@xmath20)@xmath0 , mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 , and mg@xmath19mn@xmath20b@xmath0 . @xcite these substitutions were achieved both in polycrystals and in single crystals and all cause a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "it has to be mentioned that in the case of mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 a two - phase region was reported for @xmath21 .",
    "experimentally , the mechanism of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 was addressed in one of the first publications : rather large difference in @xmath3 values , @xmath22 k , was measured between mg@xmath23b@xmath0 and mg@xmath24b@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ iso ] ) .",
    "@xcite the shift in @xmath3 associated with the mg isotope effect is significantly smaller , @xmath25 k @xcite the isotope effect coefficient , @xmath26 , is defined by @xmath27 .",
    "the experimentally determined partial isotope effect coefficients for mgb@xmath0 are @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "such a large isotope effect gives a strong indication of mgb@xmath0 being a phonon mediated superconductor with boron phonon modes being dominant for superconductivity , that is there is a strong coupling between the conduction electrons and the optical @xmath30 phonon , in which neighboring boron atoms move in opposite directions within the plane .",
    "@xcite the total isotope effect in mgb@xmath0 is still notably smaller than @xmath31 expected in the simple bcs case .",
    "this difference was addressed in several theoretical works @xcite and was suggested to be related to complex properties of mgb@xmath0 including possible anharmonicity of the boron @xmath30 phonon mode and multi - band superconductivity in this material .",
    "s - wave symmetry of the superconducting gap in mgb@xmath0 has been inferred through measurements of @xmath24b nuclear spin relaxation rate @xmath32 which was found to decrease exponentially in the superconducting state , revealing a small coherence peak just below @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite    detailed band structure calculations for mgb@xmath0 were reported in a number of publications that appeared soon after the discovery of superconductivity .",
    "@xcite @xmath33 - hybridized boron atoms form @xmath34 bonds with neighboring in - plane boron atoms .",
    "the boron @xmath35 orbitals form a 3-dimensional @xmath36 bonds by overlapping with both boron atoms within the plane and boron atoms in the adjacent planes .",
    "( the bonding and the terminology are very similar to what is found in benzene . )",
    "the in - plane @xmath34 bonds give rise to quasi-2d cylindrical @xmath34 bands , whereas @xmath36 bonds result in 3d planar honeycomb tubular networks ( fig .",
    "the extremal cross sections of the fermi surface sheets experimentally observed in de haas - van alphen experiments @xcite are in a good agreement with the band structure calculations .",
    "the observed de haas - van alphen frequencies range between @xmath37 and @xmath38 t , the effective masses are between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "comparison of the experiments and calculations point to the absence of any mass renormalization apart from that due to phonons .",
    "additionally , the electron - phonon coupling in the @xmath34 and @xmath36 bands appears to be very different , @xcite consistent with the basic view of two - band superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 that will be briefly reviewed below .",
    "despite being an s - wave , phonon mediated , bcs superconductor , mgb@xmath0 became a playground for the study of several interesting aspects associated with complex superconductors . in this material the @xmath30 phonon couples to both the @xmath34 and @xmath36 bands resulting in two distinct superconducting gaps .",
    "theoretically , two - band superconductivity was considered more than 50 years ago @xcite , experimentally , before mgb@xmath0 , only a few actual materials with possible two - band superconductivity were identified ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as a result the motivation for deeper studies of multi - gap superconductivity was limited .",
    "experimentally , the existence of two superconducting gaps in mgb@xmath0 was suggested in analysis of specific heat capacity data in superconducting state @xcite , but fitting the temperature dependent specific heat capacity data with a phenomenological two gap model @xcite with meaningful parameters ( fig .",
    "[ cp ] ) , consistent with detailed band structure calculations , @xcite was a significant advance towards proving two - gap superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite additionally this analysis gave experimentalists a viable tool that since has been widely used in many novel superconductors .",
    "@xcite theoretical discussions of the specific heat capacity and penetration depth in two - band superconductors can be found in refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "two - gap superconductivity was also inferred from measurements using raman spectroscopy , @xcite photoemission , @xcite penetration depth , @xcite and tunneling .",
    "@xcite high superconducting transition temperature , clean samples , well separated values of the superconducting gaps and almost equal partial sommerfeld constants ( similar relative weights ) associated with @xmath34 and @xmath36 bands made the experimental consequences of two - band superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 relatively easy to observe .",
    "basic physical properties as measured on high quality polycrystalline mgb@xmath0 samples were reported almost immediately after discovery of its high @xmath3 . from the specific heat capacity measurements @xcite the sommerfeld coefficient and the debye temperature",
    "were estimated to be @xmath41 mj / mol k@xmath42 and @xmath43 k , respectively , with @xmath44 value being relatively low , in the range common for normal metals , and @xmath45 being rather high , exceeding by more than factor of two the values common for metals and intermetallics .",
    "it was easy to synthesize polycrystalline samples with residual resistivity ratio values , @xmath46k@xmath47k@xmath48 , of 20 - 25 , @xcite room temperature resistivity of @xmath49  cm and resistivity just above the superconducting transition , @xmath50k@xmath51  cm .",
    "@xcite anisotropic resistivity measurements on mgb@xmath0 single crystals ( hindered by the small size , in particular thickness , of the crystals ) resulted in very similar temperature dependencies of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( i.e. almost constant resistivity anisotropy , @xmath54 ) . in the initial study the room temperature values of resistivity",
    "were reported to be @xmath55k@xmath56  cm , @xmath57k@xmath58  cm , that gives an estimate of @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite later @xcite slightly temperature dependent resistivity anisotropy @xmath60 was reported with the anisotropic residual resistivity values of 0.25 and 0.86 @xmath61  cm for @xmath53 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the hall constants were reported to be temperature dependent and of opposite signs for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( fig . [ hall ] ) , @xcite indicating presence of both types of charge carriers and , thus , multi - band electronic structure of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "initial thermodynamic and transport measurements on polycrystalline samples @xcite allowed to roughly estimate ( average ) values of superconducting parameters of mgb@xmath0 : slope of the upper critical field and the thermodynamic critical field close to @xmath3 , @xmath64 t / k and @xmath65 t / k , respectively ; the ginzburg - landau parameter , @xmath66 ; the low temperature coherence length , @xmath67 nm ; the penetration depth , @xmath68 nm . using the estimate for residual resistivity of @xmath69 cm and calculated average fermi velocity , @xmath70 cm / s @xcite the electronic mean free path of @xmath71 nm was inferred .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude higher than the superconducting coherence length , @xmath72 , which meant that pure mgb@xmath0 is deep in the clean limit of superconductivity .",
    "resistivity measurements in high magnetic fields @xcite confirmed that in the normal state mgb@xmath0 behaves as good metal with high magnetoresistance that obeys the kohler s rule and has a field dependence that can be described as @xmath73 with @xmath74 ( for high quality polycrystalline samples ) .",
    "anisotropic upper critical field for mgb@xmath0 data were inferred from a combination of magnetoresistance ( that yields the maximum upper critical field ) and magnetization measurements on clean polycrystalline samples , using the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ hc2 ] ) . at low temperatures ,",
    "the anisotropy ratio of @xmath75 was determined to be @xmath76 .",

    "[ ani ] ) .",
    "@xcite    theoretical analysis of the superconducting anisotropy in mgb@xmath0 within a weak coupling , two gaps , anisotropic s - wave model @xcite revealed that the ratio of upper critical fields , @xmath78 is not equivalent to the ratio of the london penetration depths , @xmath79 , except at @xmath3 . using realistic parameters for mgb@xmath0 , it was shown that @xmath80 increases with decreasing temperature , in agreement with experimental data , @xcite whereas @xmath81 decreases , to reach the value of @xmath82 at @xmath83 .",

    "@xcite the concept of anisotropic gaps on anisotropic fermi surfaces that yields two different anisotropy parameters , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , may lead to significant macroscopic consequences : @xcite the low temperature flux line lattice for @xmath63 is predicted to evolve from standard hexagonal in low fields to orthorhombic in increasing fields , with the disappearance of such behavior close to @xmath3 . the difference between @xmath80 and @xmath81 should be taken into account e.g. when extracting anisotropy data from torque measurements in tilted fields .",
    "in general terms , beyond the particular example of mgb@xmath0 , it should be understood that a simple question `` what is the anisotropy parameter of a superconductor ? '' may not have a unique answer .",
    "the proper question should specify the quantity of interest .",
    "additionally , it should be mentioned , that all superconducting anisotropies might be suppressed by impurities .",
    "another important theoretical development followed the experimental observation of high @xmath6 curves with unusual curvature in dirty and carbon - doped mgb@xmath0 thin films.@xcite this behavior was analyzed within a model of two - gap superconductor in a dirty limit .",
    "@xcite qualitatively the experimentally observed behavior can be understood in a simple bilayer model ( fig .",
    "[ toy ] ) where the physics of two band superconductivity is mapped onto a bilayer in which two films corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath36 bands are separated by a josephson contact that models the inter - band scattering .",
    "@xcite the global @xmath6 is then determined by the film ( band ) with the highest @xmath75 even if @xmath85 and @xmath86 are very different .",
    "this theoretical approach is reviewed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and has applications beyond superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , possibly extending to iron based superconductors .",

    "@xcite    @xmath3 of pure mgb@xmath0 decreases under pressure with the initial pressure derivatives , @xmath91 , ranging between @xmath92  k / gpa to @xmath93  k / gpa .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that the difference in the values of @xmath91 for nominally pure samples is caused by shear - stress effects in non - hydrostatic pressure media , rather than by the differences in the samples , with @xmath91 being close to @xmath92  k / gpa in hydrostatic conditions .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath3 in mgb@xmath0 was explained by strong pressure dependence of the phonon spectra .",
    "@xcite    raman spectra , lattice parameters and @xmath3 of mg@xmath23b@xmath0 and mg@xmath24b@xmath0 samples were measured under pressure up to @xmath94 gpa .",
    "@xcite the anharmonic character of the @xmath30 raman mode and anomalies in the pressure dependencies of the @xmath30 raman mode and @xmath3 at @xmath95 or @xmath96 gpa ( boron isotope dependent ) were interpreted as a result of a phonon - assisted lifshitz electronic topological transition .",
    "comparative pressure studies were made on pure , al - doped , carbon - doped and neutron damaged and annealed mgb@xmath0 with the ambient pressure values of @xmath3 ranging from @xmath97 k to @xmath98 k. ( fig .",
    "[ pre ] ) , @xcite the observed difference in @xmath91 values for different samples with similar ambient pressure superconducting transition temperatures can be qualitatively understood by considering different levels of impurities / damage on boron layers ( stronger effect in mg(b@xmath19c@xmath20)@xmath0 , less in neutron damaged mgb@xmath0 and virtually none for mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 ) and therefore on details of how the substitution or damage changes the phonon spectra .",
    "change of the upper critical field ( for @xmath62 ) under pressure up to 20.5 gpa for an mgb@xmath0 single crystal was reported in ref .",
    "the @xmath3 was reported to decrease by a factor of @xmath99 in this pressure range ( consistent with other reports @xcite ) , whereas @xmath100 decreases by a factor of @xmath101 in the same range and the shape of the @xmath6 changes with increasing pressure .",
    "based on these results it was argued @xcite that in mgb@xmath0 the electron - phonon coupling strength of the nearly two - dimensional @xmath34 band , responsible for the high @xmath3 , is more affected by pressure than coupling in the @xmath36 band , and the hole doping of the @xmath34 band decreases .",
    "successful , reliable and reproducible substitutions in mgb@xmath0 are limited to three series : mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 , mg@xmath19mn@xmath20b@xmath0 and mg(b@xmath19c@xmath20)@xmath0 @xcite ( fig .",

    "@xmath3 decreases with increase of doping , although the physics causing it is different . in the case of al substitution for mg and c substitution for b the decrease of @xmath3 values",
    "can be understood in terms of a band filling effect .",
    "al and c are both electron dopants which reduce the number of holes at the top of the @xmath34 bands together with a reduction of the electronic density of states .",
    "a simple scaling of the electron - phonon coupling constant by the variation of the density of states as a function of electron doping was considered sufficient to capture the experimentally observed behavior .",
    "@xcite it should be hoted though that these two substitutions also introduce scattering centers which act in different ways ( see discussion of @xmath75 below ) .",
    "the rate of @xmath3 suppression in mg@xmath19mn@xmath20b@xmath0 is significantly higher ( @xmath3 is completely suppressed by 2% on mn doping ) .",
    "experimental data suggest that mn ions are divalent and act as magnetic impurities , suppressing @xmath3 via a spin flip scattering mechanism .",
    "@xcite @xmath102 in the case of mg@xmath19mn@xmath20b@xmath0 follows the prediction of the abrikosov - gorkov pair - breaking theory fairly well .",
    "@xcite    in mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 the upper critical field , @xmath6 , decreases with the decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "a modest decrease in @xmath103 is accompanied by a distinct decrease in @xmath104 , resulting in significant decrease of the @xmath75 anisotropy ( fig .",
    "[ al ] ) . the superconducting gaps ,",
    "as measured by point - contact spectroscopy , decrease with the increase of the level of al - substitution ( i.e. with the decrease of @xmath3 ) , however no gap merging was observed up to al concentration @xmath105 ) ( i.e. down to @xmath106  k ) fig .",
    "this behavior of the superconducting gaps was analyzed within the two - gap , eliashberg theory with the conclusion that band filling is the main effect of the al substitution that is accompanied by some increase in inter - band scattering . @xcite    despite the difference in the mechanisms of the @xmath3 suppression , there are similarities @xmath75 and superconducting gaps evolution with substitution between mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 and mg@xmath19mn@xmath20b@xmath0 . in mg@xmath19mn@xmath20b@xmath0",

    "@xcite as distinct from al- and mn- substitution , the evolution of @xmath75 and @xmath80 with c - substitution was suggested to result from increase of the intra-@xmath36-band scattering .",

    "@xcite the measurements of superconducting gaps were performed for samples with superconducting critical temperature above 20 k , so the extrapolation of the observed behavior to lower @xmath3 samples is more ambiguous than in the case of mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 and mg@xmath19mn@xmath20b@xmath0 and caused some discussion in the literature @xcite . the data in @xcite ( fig .",

    "@xcite both pressure and neutron irradiation cause change of the lattice parameters , however the effects of these changes on @xmath3 are opposite . using residual resistivity , @xmath118 to parameterize @xmath3 gives similar trends for neutron damage and al- doping , but not for c- doping , the values of @xmath119 as a function of @xmath3 are very different when neutron irradiation , al- doping and c- doping are used .",
    "the changes in superconducting properties of neutron - irradiated samples were suggested to be primarily the result of an increase in the inter - band scattering and possible changes in the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "@xcite this comparison suggested that every perturbation used to modify superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 has its own , particular and complex , mixture of different mechanisms ( inter - band scattering , intra - band scattering , band - specific change in density of states ) that makes targeted tuning of the mgb@xmath0 properties a difficult task .",
    "on one hand , the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 doubled the @xmath3 value for conventional phonon - mediated bcs superconductors and presented a clear example of i ) two gap superconductivity and ii ) low density of states , high temperature superconductivity . on the other hand , despite the initial hopes , discovery of high temperature superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 was not followed by finding a family of related , interesting superconductors ( although it did motivate broad searches for hints of superconductivity in wide classes of available materials @xcite ) . moreover , the allowed perturbations of mgb@xmath0 are limited , with only c- doping in a particular range of concentrations resulting in enhanced upper critical field .",
