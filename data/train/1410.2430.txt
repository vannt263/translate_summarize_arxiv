    "most interesting signals are _",
    "structured_. this is what distinguishes them from mere random noise .",
    "this structure can often be expressed in terms of _ sparsity _ in a particular basis .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath0 $ ] represents @xmath1 signal examples , there must exist a set of @xmath2 atoms or a _ dictionary _ @xmath3 $ ] such that each signal is a linear combination of only a few atoms , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is sparse . estimating @xmath6 and @xmath5 from @xmath7 is a sparse instance of _ matrix factorization_. in audio signal processing , it is natural to seek such a factorization in the non - negative _ power spectral density _ ( psd ) domain , since the magnitude spectra of natural sounds such as speech often feature redundancy and sparsity .",
    "this approach gave rise to a large number of methods for audio signal representation and extraction within the framework of _ non - negative matrix factorization _",
    "in contrast , complex spectra are usually considered uninformative and therefore not investigated . while single - channel signals are well represented by their psd only , disregarding the phase comes with a substantial loss of information in multichannel signals .",
    "indeed , phase differences carry important spatial cues . for this reason",
    ", nearly all existing nmf - based methods are limited to monaural sound processing , although recent multichannel extensions of nmf have been proposed for music signal separation@xcite .",
    "these method do not rely on sparsity and must be tuned to a known , relatively small number of target sources . in this paper , we propose a new sparse representation for multichannel signals in the complex fourier domain .",
    "the key novelty is to _ estimate _ the instantaneous phases of all involved signal spectra instead of ignoring them .",
    "the proposed decomposition may be viewed as blindly unmixing a mixture of @xmath8 sources where @xmath9 is the number of microphones .",
    "the fundamental assumption is here that each source contributes a specific complex - valued spectral component to the observation , and that the gain and the activation of each source is sparse along the time axis .",
    "we first derive a phase - optimized generalization of the well - known _ orthogonal matching pursuit _ ( omp ) method @xcite .",
    "this generalization allows sparse coding of a multichannel signal @xmath10 given a dictionary @xmath6 , independently of instantaneous source phases .",
    "moreover , we show that an optimal dictionary @xmath6 as well as all instantaneous source phases and sparse activations can be blindly estimated from a set of signal examples @xmath7 only .",
    "this is achieved by deriving a phase - optimized generalization of the popular k - svd algorithm@xcite .",
    "the proposed representation is applied to noise reduction in the context of a humanoid robot producing self - noise ( _ego - noise_ ) when performing motor actions @xcite .",
    "this problem is extremely challenging for two reasons : first , the noise signal is highly non - stationary due to fast and irregular motions and collisions .",
    "this rules out the use of conventional spectral - subtraction methods such as @xcite .",
    "second , ego - noise signals exhibit nonzero spatial coherence between microphones @xcite .",
    "however , they can not be modeled by a single point source , nor even by a small set of point sources . in the case of a walking robot , clicks generated by collisions with the floor as well as",
    "full body and microphone movements are producing sounds arriving at the microphones from many directions with unknown transfer functions .",
    "this seriously limits the usefulness of spatial filtering methods such as beamforming @xcite or blind source separation @xcite .    on the positive side ,",
    "motor noise signals are strongly structured .",
    "this has been exploited using noise template databases @xcite .",
    "these approaches are based on vector quantization , which can be seen as a particular instance of k - svd@xcite .",
    "some approaches estimate the instantaneous noise psd using gaussian process models @xcite or neural networks @xcite .",
    "these methods rely on synchronized motor state information , which may not be reliably available in practice .",
    "let @xmath0\\in\\mathbb{c}^{mf\\times t}$ ] be an observed @xmath11channel spectrogram with @xmath12 frequency bins and @xmath1 time frames .",
    "we use the decomposition @xmath13\\tp$ ] where @xmath14 is the captured @xmath9-channel signal at @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is the recording of a finite but potentially large mixture of @xmath2 sound sources , each emitting a specific spectral shape .",
    "one intuitive interpretation of this model in the target application of a robot recording its own noise is that the sources correspond to all possible sounds that can be emitted from the various mechanical parts of the moving robot , effectively forming a signal with an intricate spatial distribution .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the transfer function from source @xmath17 to the @xmath9 microphones at frequency @xmath18 .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 with @xmath20 the instantaneous phase of source @xmath17 at @xmath15 . at time @xmath21",
    ", we assume that each source @xmath17 emits a fixed magnitude spectrum @xmath22\\tp\\in\\mathbb{r}^{+f}$ ] multiplied by an _ activation factor _ ( gain ) @xmath23 .",
    "a central assumption of our model is that the activation vector @xmath24\\tp$ ] is _ sparse _ , _ i.e. _ , only a small number @xmath25 of sources is active at time @xmath21 , and @xmath26 has at most @xmath27 nonzero elements ( @xmath28 ) . for all @xmath18 and @xmath21 ,",
    "the mixing model reads : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents some residual noise at @xmath15 . to simplify this expression , the transfer function and the magnitude spectrum of source @xmath17 at frequency @xmath18",
    "are combined into a single vector @xmath31 .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the signal s _ dictionary _ whose columns or _ atoms _ are the vectors @xmath33\\tp\\in\\mathbb{c}^{mf}$ ] . in practice , each atom @xmath17 can be normalized so that @xmath34 and that each entry of @xmath35 associated to the first channel is real - valued and positive .",
    "this comes without loss of generality because the source activations and instantaneous phases compensate this normalization in equation ( [ eq : mixing_model ] ) .",
    "let @xmath36\\in\\mathbb{c}^{f\\times k}$ ] denote the matrix of all source phases at frame @xmath21 .",
    "we define the _ phase - corrected dictionary _ at frame @xmath21 by : @xmath37\\in\\mathbb{c}^{mf\\times k}.\\ ] ] the model ( [ eq : mixing_model ] ) can now be rewritten as @xmath38 where @xmath26 is a sparse vector . if @xmath39 is known , estimating @xmath26 in order to minimize @xmath40 given @xmath10 is known as a _ sparse coding _",
    "problem @xcite .",
    "however in the considered case of a multichannel sound mixture , this would require the prior knowledge of not only the @xmath2 sources transfer functions and magnitude spectra contained in @xmath6 , but also their instantaneous phases contained in @xmath41 .",
    "the latter randomly varies over time , is hard to predict , and should therefore be estimated from the signal .",
    "this yields the following novel optimization problem , which will be referred to as _ phase - optimized sparse coding _ : @xmath42 note that due to the sparsity of @xmath26 , only those @xmath43 for which @xmath44 intervene in the target function .",
    "the others can be ignored , leading to a sparse matrix @xmath41 . moreover , the non - negativity constraint on @xmath45 is not necessary , since for any complex pair @xmath46 , the pair @xmath47 leaves the cost function unchanged .",
    "this constraint is thus relaxed in the remainder of the paper .",
    "although finding an exact solution to sparse coding was proven to be np - hard @xcite , a number of efficient approximate methods have been proposed @xcite , among which _ orthogonal matching pursuit _",
    "( omp ) @xcite is one of the most widely used due to its simplicity and high practical efficiency . in this section ,",
