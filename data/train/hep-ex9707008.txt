    "in the context of this paper i will review the current status of exotic mesons ; glueballs and hybrid mesons .",
    "our current best evidence for a glueball comes from the scalar meson sector , @xmath0 . in this sector",
    "there appears to be two states , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are produced in several glue  rich mechanisms .",
    "the decay rates of the @xmath1 have been studied in detail by the crystal barrel experiment which finds that this state can not be explained as either a pure glueball nor a pure meson .",
    "the @xmath1 combined with the @xmath2 leads us to the interpretation that these states are mixtures of both glueball and normal mesons . in the tensor sector , there is currently a very interesting candidate state , the @xmath3 .",
    "its best evidence comes from radiative @xmath4 decays , and appears to have several properties suggestive of glueballs .",
    "lastly , there is evidence from e852 at brookhaven for a state with explicitly exotic quantum numbers .",
    "however several properties of this state seem to disagree with expectations for a hybrid meson .",
    "a pure glueball is a bound state of only gluons . due to the fact that gluons carry the color charges of qcd , it is theoretically possible for them to form bound states devoid of any quark content .",
    "the quantum numbers of these states are derived by considering them to contain either 2 or 3 _ valence _ gluons .",
    "while we are still unable to solve qcd exactly in the nonperturbative regime , most models which are able to explain observed phenomena predict that glueballs should exist , and most predict the lightest will be the scalar , @xmath0 . at the moment",
    ", we believe that lattice calculations come closest to actually solving non  perturbative qcd .",
    "a calculation of the entire glueball spectrum  @xcite finds that the scalar glueball has a mass of @xmath5mev / c@xmath6 while the next lightest state is the tensor at a mass of @xmath7mev / c@xmath6 .",
    "a recent calculation with a factor of 10 improvement in lattice density predicts that the scalar glueball has a mass of @xmath8mev / c@xmath6 , and for the first time makes predictions for decay rates into flavorless pseudoscalar meson pairs as a function of mass  @xcite .",
    "given that the two groups have a different procedures to extrapolate to the continuum limit , we take the average of these , @xmath9 mev / c@xmath6 , as the prediction for the mass of a pure scalar glueball .    next we consider where we should search for glueballs .",
    "there are several reactions which are considered as glue  rich .",
    "radiative @xmath4 decays , @xmath10 are generally considered the best source of glueballs simply because the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quark have to annihilate in order for the decay to proceed . defining @xmath13 , expectations from  @xcite give : @xmath14 where equation  [ eq : normal ] is for a normal meson and equation  [ eq : glue ] is for a glueball .",
    "these quantities can be related to the radiative decay rate via equations  [ 0++-rate ] and  [ 2++-rate ] .",
    "@xmath15 in a similar argument , @xmath16 annihilations are also considered a likely source of glueballs simply because there are so many quarks and antiquarks .",
    "it is unfortunately difficult to predict rates , and any signal will be mixed into a background of normal mesons .",
    "finally double pomeron exchange in central production , @xmath17 is believed to be a likely source of glueballs as the pomeron seems to involve glue .",
    "in addition to glue rich sources , there are glue  poor source such as @xmath18 and photoproduction . there is no direct coupling between the photon and the electrically neutral gluons , so production of glueballs should be suppressed .    finally , the glueballs are expected to have a decay pattern which in some sense is flavour blind .",
    "the gluon couples equally to all flavours of quarks , so the production of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks are expected to be more or less the same .",
    "one calculation  @xcite yields the values in table  [ tab : glueball - decay ] as the expected relative strengths of for two  pseudoscalar decays .",
    "in addition , the @xmath22 decay involving two pairs of @xmath23 @xmath21wave dipions , @xmath24 is expected to be a significant and large decay mode of a glueball  @xcite .",
    "this combined with the two  pseudoscalar decays yields the following expectations .",
    ".predicted glueball decay rates . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ( 400,100 )    ( 32,0)(0,1)20 ( 58,0)(0,1)20 ( 198,0)(0,1)20 ( 237,0)(0,1)20 ( 340,45)(0,1)20 ( 380,84)(-1,0)20    finally a third scalar state , the @xmath25 is hinted at in the @xmath26 final state  @xcite .",
    "however , this state is near the edge of available phase space and is so far only observed in the one decay mode .",
    "however as we examine radiative @xmath4 decays we find that this @xmath2 is probably the scalar component of the @xmath27 .",
    "a reanalysis of mkiii data  @xcite on @xmath28 finds two scalar states both decaying to @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 , ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "in addition they find a @xmath32 state at a mass of @xmath33mev / c@xmath6 and a width @xmath34 .",
    "these latter two states both come from the @xmath27 region .",
    "they find the radiative decay rates to the scalars as given in  [ mk3-f01500 ] and  [ mk3-f01750 ] .",
    "@xmath35 recently , bes has reported both a tensor and scalar state in the @xmath27 region , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , both decaying to @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "these are presumably the same states as seen in mkiii , and we will adopt the name @xmath2 for the scalar state . at this conference , bes reported on radiative decays to four pions  @xcite .",
    "they find the results ; and  [ bes - f01750 ] .",
    "@xmath43 taking these together with the fact that @xmath22 is on order of 50% of the decay rate , one finds using equations  [ 0++-rate ] and  [ 2++-rate ] that @xmath44 both of which are highly suggestive of a large gluonic content in the states  @xcite .",

    "however a recent observation made by the wa91 and wa102 collaborations  @xcite yields an interesting separation of normal mesons from the exotic candidates . in central production ,",
    "double pomeron exchange is believed to be responsible for formation of gluonic states . however , normal mesons are also produced , and separation of these has always been difficult . if we consider the transverse momentum transfer from each proton as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the beam axis along @xmath50 , one can define a variable @xmath51 in a sense , this is the difference in transverse momentum between the two pomerons .",
    "when this quantity is small one could visualize the two pomerons as traveling together , while when this is large , they are moving apart .",
    "data for @xmath52 and @xmath53 are shown in figure  [ fig : wa102 ] .",
    "the interesting feature is that for large @xmath54 , ( * c * and * f * ) , @xmath55 shows a clear signal for the @xmath46 and @xmath22 shows a clear signal for the @xmath45  both of which are normal mesons .",
    "however in the small @xmath54 region , ( * a * and * d * ) both of the previous states are gone and the @xmath1 and @xmath27 appear . having the pomerons moving _ together",
    "_ enhances the exotic candidates , while having them move _ apart _ enhances the normal mesons .",
    "these three production mechanisms taken together lead one to the conclusion that both the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 have a large gluonic component . given that these are near the scalar mesons",
    ", one interpretation is that the pure @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 states have mixed and become the observed @xmath59 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 states .",
    "two mixing schemes have been proposed to explain this .",
    "a lattice inspired mixing based on computed masses  @xcite and a more data inspired approach  @xcite .",
    "both of these claim to explain the measured decay rates of the @xmath1 state and are quite similar in their predictions . at this point",
    "it seems we have very strong evidence for a scalar glueball state mixed into the scalar nonet , and the question is now down to details of mixing .",
    "assuming we have found the scalar glueball near the lattice predictions , we also can ask about the next state , the tensor glueball . here",
    "the information is not nearly as clear , but a new candidate , the @xmath3 or @xmath60 has reemerged in recent years due to new measurements from bes  @xcite .",
    "this state has a mass of 2230 and an extremely narrow width of 20 .",
    "in addition , its decays appear nearly flavour  blind over @xmath61 , @xmath42 and @xmath16",
    ". it also appears to have a rather large rate for @xmath62 which would be indicative of a large gluonic component .",
    "however it s spin is currently unclear  being either @xmath32 or @xmath63 .",
    "even though it has been reported by bes to decay to @xmath16 , this state has not been observed in @xmath16 direct production .",
    "dave hertzog  @xcite has given a nice summary of the results and consequences of this at this conference .",
    "the current situation is that these measurements are just barely compatible , but as the @xmath16 limits improve , this may change .",
    "in addition , this state has been searched for and not observed in two  photon production  @xcite .",
    "its nonobservation lends support to the glueball interpretation if this state is indeed a tensor .",
    "finally , bes has recently reported the observation of @xmath22 decays of a state @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "they find a spin 2 state at a mass of @xmath65 and a width of @xmath66 decaying to @xmath67 . while the width is larger",
    "than that observed for the @xmath3 , if they are the same state it is a measurement of the spin .",
    "in addition , they find a radiative rate of @xmath68 .",
    "hybrids are meson  like states to which a valence gluon has been added .",
    "the quantum numbers of these states are given by those of the underlying meson plus the quantum numers of the gluon .",
    "these states are predicted in several models , and are expected to appear in nonets . in the _ fluxtube _ model of isgur and paton  @xcite one expects 8 nonets with quantum numbers , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "what makes these states intriguing is that the quantum numbers are not possible for a @xmath74 pair .",
    "observation of a state with these quantum numbers would be a _ smoking gun _ for a non@xmath74 state .",
    "the masses of the lightest hybrid mesons are expected to be in the 1700 to 1900 mev / c@xmath6 mass range , and an additional signature is that they are expected to decay into a pair of p and s wave mesons , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 , _ etc .",
    "_ whereas final states like @xmath77 and @xmath61 should be suppressed . in addition , the hybrids with @xmath74 quantum numbers might very well mix with their normal meson counterpart .",
    "a recent calculation of the decays of all mesons and hybrids  @xcite withing the framework of the fluxtube model will provide a guide to interpreting these states , but we need to observe a state with non@xmath74 quantum numbers to prove the existence of hybrids .    at this conference , brookhaven e852 has presented evidence for a @xmath78 state decaying into @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "this state , the @xmath79 is observed in the reaction @xmath80 at @xmath81gev / c .",
    "the state appears from a detailed partial wave analysis , and is seen via its interference with the much stronger @xmath82 state .",
    "the data are most easily explained by the introduction of a resonant state with a mass @xmath83 and a width of @xmath84 . in figure  [ fig - e852 ]",
    "are shown the results of their partial wave analysis .",
    "the results yields 8 possible solutions , and the ranges of each value are shown as solid vertical bars for the fits . * a * shows the @xmath85 wave which corresponds to the strong @xmath82 , while in * b * is the resulting amplitude of the @xmath86 partial wave as a function of @xmath87 mass .",
    "the amplitude peaks near 1370 , and is about 3% of the strength of the @xmath85 wave . in * c * is shown the fit phase difference between the two waves . in order to explain this",
    ", they postulate that a resonant state , the @xmath79 is produced in addition to the @xmath82 .",
    "they allow a relative production phase between these and treat both states as breit  wigner resonances .",
    "this hypothesis is able to reproduce the data , and yields the 4 phases shown in * d * with the relative production constant over the @xmath87 invariant mass .",
    "their data agree quite well with earlier data from ves in the reaction @xmath88 at @xmath89gev / c .",
    "in particular the same phase difference is observed in both data sets .",
    "while there does appear to be something here , it s interpretation is not so clear .",
    "the mass seems too low to be the hybrid meson predicted by the flux tube model , and the decay mode is also not favored .",
    "if it is a hybrid meson , then we expect it to be a member of a nonet .",
    "in particular we expect to find both an @xmath90 and an @xmath91 state .",
    "depending on their masses , likely decay modes would be either @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "the latter would be particularly difficult to extract from data , but its observation may be quite important as establishing this state as a hybrid meson .",
    "the scalar meson sector shows strong evidence for a glueball mixed into the normal mesons .",
    "two states , @xmath1 and @xmath2 have both been observed in three glue  rich mechanisms . in radiative @xmath4 decays ,",
    "their large rates are indicative of a large gluonic content .",
    "in central production , both states stand out from normal mesons via the @xmath54 in equation  [ eq : dpt ] .",
    "finally , in @xmath16 annihilation , the relative decay rates of the @xmath1 have been measured and lead one to the conclusion that the state is neither a pure meson nor a pure glueball .",
    "the simplest explanation for what we observe is that the three observed scalars , @xmath59 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the result of mixing between the pure @xmath56 and @xmath57 with the scalar glueball @xmath58 . in the tensor sector , we have a rather interesting candidate , the @xmath3 . this state is observed in radiative @xmath4 decays with a rate suggestive of a large gluonic content , has a very narrow width @xmath94mev and seems to have flavor blind decays .",
    "while more details are needed , this does appear as our best candidate for the tensor glueball .",
    "finally , we have evidence for a state with exotic quantum numbers , @xmath79 observed in @xmath80 .",
    "the state is consistent between two different @xmath95 experiments , but its interpretation is murky .",
    "its mass is much lower than one expects for a hybrid meson , but observation of one of its partners could help clarify this .",
