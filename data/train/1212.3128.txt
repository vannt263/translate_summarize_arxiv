    "it is an ubiquitous and intriguing question in the mathematical analysis under which conditions the dynamics of a given high - dimensional system with small parameters can be described by low - dimensional , reduced evolution equations . in this paper",
    "we answer this question , at least partially , for a particular example , namely the fokker - planck equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the small parameters and @xmath3 is a one - dimensional state variable .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 is supposed to be a double - well potential and @xmath5 is a dynamical multiplier chosen such that the solution complies with @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a prescribed control function .",
    "this dynamical constraint is , for admissible initial data , equivalent to the mean - field formula @xmath8 which turns into a nonlocal , nonlinear , and non - autonomous pde .",
    "nonlocal fokker - planck equations like + have been introduced in @xcite in order to model the hysteretic behavior of many - particle storage systems such as modern lithium - ion batteries ( for the physical background , we also refer to @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", @xmath3 describes the thermodynamic state of a single particle ( nano - particle made of iron - phosphate in the battery case ) , @xmath4 is the free energy of each particle , and @xmath2 accounts for entropic effects .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 is the probability density of a many - particle ensemble and the dynamical control @xmath7 reflects that the whole system is driven by some external process ( charging or discharging of the battery ) .",
    "since @xmath4 is non - convex , the dynamics of + can be rather involved as they are related to three different time scales , namely the small relaxation time @xmath1 , the time scale of the control @xmath7 ( which is supposed to be of order @xmath10 ) , and the kramers time scale .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath11 and corresponds , as discussed below , to probabilistic transitions between the different wells of the time - dependent effective potential with energy barriers @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper we restrict our considerations to the fast reaction regime , in which the particular scaling relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 guarantees that the time scale is of order @xmath10 for certain values of @xmath5 , and study the small - parameter limit @xmath14 .",
    "our main result is that the microscopic pde + can be replaced by a low - dimensional dynamical system which governs the evolution of the dynamical multiplier @xmath5 and the phase fraction @xmath15 where the stable regions ( or ` phases ' ) are the connected components of @xmath16 .",
    "the micro - to - macro transition studied here has much in common with those in @xcite , which likewise derive macroscopic models for the dynamics of phase transitions from microscopic gradient flows with non - convex energy and external driving . our microscopic system , however , is different as it involves the diffusive term @xmath17 , which causes specific effects and necessitates the use of different methods .",
    "[ [ many - particle - interpretation ] ] many - particle interpretation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it is well - known , see for instance @xcite , that the linear fokker - planck equation with @xmath18 is equivalent to the langevin equation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes a standard brownian motion in @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , @xmath9 describes for @xmath18 the statistics of a large ensemble of identical particles , where each single particle is driven by the gradient flow of @xmath4 but also affected by stochastic fluctuations .",
    "if both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are small , the deterministic force is very strong and dominates the stochastic term .",
    "most of the particles are therefore located near either one of the two local minima of @xmath4 and random transitions between these wells are very unlikely . for the linear fokker - planck equation",
    "this means that @xmath9 quickly approaches a meta - stable state composed of two narrow peaks ; the time scale of this fast relaxation process is @xmath1 , the width of the peaks scales with @xmath2 , and the mass distribution between the meta - stable peaks depends on the initial data for @xmath9 . in the long run , however , the stochastic fluctuations imply that the mass distribution between the peaks converges to its unique equilibrium value .",
    "kramers investigated this problem in the context of chemical reactions in @xcite and derived his seminal formula for the effective mass flux between the two phases , see formula below .",
    "for more details on kramers formula and the connection to the theory of large deviations we refer , for instance , to @xcite .    for the nonlocal fokker - planck equation",
    ", the dynamical constraint augments the deterministic force by the nonlocal coupling term @xmath5 .",
    "the energy landscape for the single - particle evolution is therefore no longer given by @xmath4 but by the effective potential @xmath22 which is , depending on the value of @xmath5 , either a non - convex single - well or a double - well potential .",
    "the crucial point is that the number , the positions , and the energies of local minima of @xmath23 are time - dependent as @xmath5 is non - constant .",
    "moreover , we have no a priori information about the evolution of @xmath23 because @xmath5 is not given explicitly but only implicitly via .",
    "any asymptotic statement about the small - parameter dynamics of nonlocal fokker - planck equations therefore requires a careful analysis of the time scale on which @xmath5 is changing . in the parameter regime",
    "studied below we are able to establish a substitute to @xmath24 , which then implies , roughly speaking , that @xmath5 evolves regularly and hence that there is always a clear but state - dependent relation between the different time scales in the problem .",
    "[ [ parameter - regimes ] ] parameter regimes + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the different dynamical regimes for @xmath25 have been investigated by the authors in @xcite using formal asymptotic analysis . according to these results ,",
    "there exist two main regimes , called _ slow reactions _ and _ fast reactions _ , as well as several sub - regimes related to limiting or borderline cases , see table [ tbl : scalingregimes ] . in each small - parameter regime , numerical simulations as well as heuristic arguments indicate that the probability density @xmath26 can  at least at most of the times @xmath27  be described by either one or two narrow and localized peaks .",
    "we therefore expect that the small - parameter dynamics can always be characterized in terms of the positions and masses of these peaks .",
    "the key dynamical features , however , depend very much on the scaling relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the temporal behavior of the macroscopic quantities @xmath5 and @xmath28 is rather different for @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; see figure [ fig : numsim ] for an illustration and @xcite for further numerical results .    in the fast reaction regime ,",
    "each localized peak is always confined to one of the stable regions and only a very small fraction of the mass is inside the spinodal interval @xmath31 . moreover , for most values of @xmath5 the mass distribution between both peaks does not change and the dynamical constraint just alters the peak positions by adapting them to the instantaneous values of @xmath7 . for certain values of @xmath5 , however , the peaks do exchange mass since the particles that pass through the spinodal region by stochastic fluctuations produce a non - negligible mass flux between the different phases .",
    "this leaking or tunneling process is governed by kramers formula and described in  [ sect : heuristicdynamics ] in more detail .",
    "the peak dynamics in the slow reaction regime is completely different for two reasons .",
    "first , kramers - type phase transitions are not feasible anymore since the corresponding time scale is , for all relevant values of @xmath5 , much larger than @xmath10 .",
    "the second important observation is that the dynamical constraint can drive a localized peak with positive mass into the spinodal region .",
    "the emerging unstable peak remains narrow for a while but splits suddenly into two stable peaks due to a subtle interplay between the parabolic and the kinetic terms of ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "the macroscopic behavior in the borderline regime can be regarded as the limiting case of both the fast and the slow reaction regime ; see also the respective comments in the caption of figure [ fig : numsim ] .",
    "more precisely , for algebraic scaling relations @xmath32 with @xmath33 , the localized peaks can still penetrate the spinodal interval but they split into stable peaks after a short time depending on @xmath2 . for @xmath34 , however , the kramers mechanism still produces macroscopic phase transitions but only when the minimal energy barrier of @xmath23 is algebraically small in @xmath2 .",
    "finally , phase transitions happen in the quasi - stationary limit whenever the two wells of @xmath23 have the same energy , that means when @xmath5 attains a certain value which depends on @xmath4 but not on @xmath35 .",
    "[ [ limit - dynamics ] ] limit dynamics + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in what follows we solely consider the fast reaction regime , that means we suppose that @xmath1 and @xmath28 are coupled as in the bottom row of table [ tbl : scalingregimes ] by some positive scaling parameter @xmath35 , which is basically independent of @xmath2 but not too large ( see assumption [ ass : tau ] below ) .",
    "the key dynamical observation is that kramers - type phase transitions can manifest on the macroscopic scale only if the dynamical multiplier @xmath5 attains one of two critical values @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which depend on @xmath4 and @xmath35 , because otherwise the corresponding microscopic mass flux between the two phases is either too small or too large .",
    "the limit dynamics for @xmath38 is therefore completely characterized by the flow rule @xmath39 and pointwise relations @xmath40 that encode the dynamical constraint .",
    "these findings can be summarized as follows .    under natural assumptions on @xmath4 , the control @xmath7 , and the initial data , the triple @xmath41 satisfies in the limit @xmath38 of the fast reaction regime a closed rate - independent evolution equation with hysteresis . moreover , the limit solution is unique provided that the initial data are well - prepared .",
    "we expect that our methods and results can be generalized to both the borderline regime and the quasi - stationary limit for the price of more notational and analytical effort ; see the discussion at the end of  [ sect : limitmodel ] .",
    "the small - parameter dynamics of the slow reaction regime , however , has to be studied in a completely different framework ; it is currently unclear , at least to the authors , how the formal results from @xcite can be justified rigorously .",
