    "being the most luminous member of the local group and the nearest archetypical spiral galaxy , m31 serves as the best astrophysical laboratory for the studies of the physical and astrophysical processes that govern the structure , kinematics and the formation and evolution of distant galaxies .",
    "recent deep optical surveys have revealed complex substructures within hundreds of kiloparsec ( kpc ) of m31 , with some of them stretching from m31 all the way to m33 , which is about 200 kpc from m31 , suggesting a possible recent close encounter of the two galaxies ( ibata et al .",
    "2007 ; mcconnachie et al .  2009 ) .",
    "detailed chemical and kinematic investigations of m31 and associated substructures are vital for our understanding of m31 , and also for the theory of galaxy formation and evolution in general .",
    "finding background quasars in the vicinity of m31 have the following two potential important applications .",
    "firstly , the background quasars can serve as an ideal reference frame which would allow highly accurate astrometric measurement of the minute proper motion ( pm ) of m31 and also the pms of its associated coherent substructures .",
    "secondly , absorption - line spectroscopy of bright background quasars can be used to probe the distribution , chemical composition and kinematics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of m31 , the milky way and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) of the local group of galaxies .",
    "this technique can be used to probe structures further out from the center of the galaxy than would be possible with traditional stellar spectroscopy , or using h  i 21 cm observations .",
    "in addition , m31 has alway been a focus of interest for astronomical observations .",
    "extensive photometric data spanning tens of years exist .",
    "therefore , identifying background quasars in the vicinity of m31 should also enable the construction of a valuable sample for studying quasar variability .",
    "the pm of m31 represents one of the most fundamental quantities of the local group , and its accurate measurement is vital to the study of the formation , evolution and dynamics of the local group , in particular for quantifying the dark matter content .",
    "m31 is known to be located at a distance of @xmath0 785 kpc ( mcconnachie et al . 2005 ) , and is moving towards the milky way with a velocity of 117 km s@xmath4 ( binney & tremaine , 1987 , p.605 ) .",
    "however , its transverse velocity has remained unknown for a long time . the very long baseline array , with a pm measurement uncertainty of the order of one micro - arcsec , has measured the distance and pm of m33 by water maser observations ( brunthaler et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , water maser sources in m31 have been discovered only recently ( darling 2011 ) , thus we do not yet have a long enough time baseline for a meaningful pm measurements .",
    "based on kinematic information about m31 s satellite galaxies , m33 and ic10 , loeb et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and van der marcel & guhathakurta ( 2008 ) deduced theoretical estimates for the pm of m31 of about 80 km s@xmath4 ( 20 @xmath5as yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "sohn , anderson & van der marel ( 2012 ) presented the first direct pm measurements for three m31 fields ( @xmath0 2.7@xmath62.7 sq .",
    "arcmin .  for each field ) using _ hst _ observations that span a time baseline of 57 yrs . due to the sparseness of known background quasars ,",
    "their analysis had to resort to using compact background galaxies as reference sources , even though it was hard to obtain highly accurate positions for those galaxies given their nature as extended sources .",
    "being essentially point sources with zero pms , background quasars can serve as perfect reference sources for highly accurate pm measurements , provided that enough of them with sufficient space density can be identified .    at the distance of m31",
    ", even a luminous red giant branch star has an @xmath7 magnitude fainter than 20 , hence high resolution spectroscopic determinations of their chemical composition are no easy tasks even for a 10 m class telescope ( ibata et al .",
    "2005 ; gilbert et al .",
    "absorption - line spectroscopy of background quasars allow one to probe the distribution , chemical composition and kinematics of the ism associated with m31 , and this technique can be used to probe material further out from the galaxy center than is possible with traditional stellar spectroscopy or with h  i 21 cm observations ( chemin , carignan & foster 2009 ) .",
    "a number of papers have been published ( see savage et al .",
    "2000 ; schneider et al .  1993 and",
    "references therein ) , reporting milky way absorption line systems which were detected in quasar spectra .",
    "analyses of those systems have revealed great complexity of the milky way halo gas , which exhibits a wide range of ionization states , chemical compositions and kinematics .",
    "similar absorption - line spectroscopic analysis of m31 background quasars will help understand the formation history of m31 and the local group .",
    "a number of efforts have been taken to search for background quasars behind nearby galaxies , with the intended purpose being to study their pms or ism / igm .",

    "with the aim of searching for background quasars in the vicinity of m31 and m33 , we selected quasar candidates based on the available optical , near infrared ( ir ) photometric data in the extended area of m31 and m33 . only point - source quasar candidates were selected in order to provide a clean sample for the pm measurements and ism / igm studies .",
    "fig.[qsocand ] shows the fields observed with the lamost during 2010 and 2011 observational seasons .",
    "m31 is covered by a special scan of a total area of 100 square degrees , 5@xmath8 wide and 20@xmath8 long , along the northeast - southwest direction ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",

    "m33 is covered by the sdss southern galactic cap survey ( aihara et al .",

    "deg .    as shown in fig.[qsocand ]",
    ", there are no reliable photometric data from the sdss in the central area of m31 and m33 given the very high stellar densities there . to select candidates in those crowded fields , we have made use of the @xmath11 photometric catalog of m31 and m33 provided by the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope ( massey et al .",

    "for the sky area also covered by the sdss , we find that about 60% of these wise ir quasar candidates overlap with the optically - selected low - redshift sample . as shown in wu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , this ir - based technique is capable of finding quasars with redshifts up to @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , for the central regions of m31 and m33 , this ir selection algorithm also yields too many interlopers , in particular along the optical disk of m31 and m33 .",
    "we expect that most of these sources are actually candidates asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , young stellar objects ( yso ) or red stars .",
    "these are interesting objects to study in their own right .",
    "further more , finding quasars in the very central regions of m31 and m33 will be extremely valuable for the pm measurements and ism spectroscopic studies .",

    "the exposure time for the plates vary from 600 to 1800s , repeated 2 or 3 times to allow rejection of cosmic rays and to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . in total , 731 and 5641 unique quasar candidates",
    "were observed in 2010 and 2011 , respectively .",
    "some sources were targeted repeatedly .",
    "this is partly because the field of view of lamost is circular , which forces adjacent fields to overlap to allow coverage of a large contiguous sky area . in 2010 , only sdss optically - selected low - redshift quasars candidates were selected and observed . in october and november of 2010 ,",
    "lamost ccds suffered severe electromagnetic interference and insufficient dewar cooling , and so few useful data were collected .",
    "see fig.[qsocand ] for the fields targeted by the lamost in both 2010 and 2011 .",
    "the lamost has 16 low resolution spectrographs , each accommodating 250 fibers .",
    "from the fall of 2011 , lamost impleted slit masks with a width of 2/3 the 3.3arcsec fiber diameter , yielding a spectral resolving power @xmath0 1800 . before",
    "that a mixture of full ( i.e.  no slit masks ) and 1/2 slit modes were used , but mostly in full slit mode , which yields a spectral resolution @xmath0 1000 .",
    "the light that enter each spectrograph is split into two channels , the blue and red channels , for which the wavelength coverages are 3700 - 5900 @xmath17 and 5700 - 9000 @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the spectra from each spectrograph are imaged onto two 4096@xmath64096 ccd cameras ( see cui et al .",
    "2012 for further details ) .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the lamost 2d pipeline , including bias subtraction , spectra tracing and extraction , wavelength calibration , flat - fielding and sky subtraction ( see luo , zhang & zhao 2004 ; luo et al .",
    "2012 ) . considering the uncertainties in the commissioning phase and the pilot surveys , and the relatively low s / n of most quasar candidate spectra , for the current work of identifying quasars ,",
    "the non flux - calibrated spectra were used .",
    "hence the photometric magnitudes serve as much better measurements of the brightness of our targets .    ,",
    "this current work is based on observations collected during the lamost commissioning phase and the pilot surveys when the lamost performance was still being characterized and optimized . thus it is unavoidable that the data presented here suffer from some defects in one way or another , such as low throughput , poor sky subtraction and so on .",
    "the fiber positioning , although improved significantly in spring 2011 , still has room for further improvement .",
    "fortunately , given their characteristic broad emission line , quasars are easily identified .",
    "we visually examined the 1d spectra of each individual quasar candidate .",
