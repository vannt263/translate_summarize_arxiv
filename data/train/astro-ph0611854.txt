    "it is generally believed that diffuse galactic @xmath0-rays are a good probe of the production sites and also the propagation of accelerated charged particles in the galactic plane ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "complementary knowledge of the cosmic - ray ( cr ) propagation is based on the isotopic composition and the content of secondary particles / anti - particles of the locally observed crs which , however , requires a number of model - dependent assumptions . also , it is not clear whether or not the locally observed cr spectra can be taken as representative for the entire galaxy @xcite .    the observed diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission is composed of three spectral components @xcite : @xmath0-rays from bremsstrahlung and from inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , and also from the decay of secondary particles , mostly neutral pions , produced in collisions of cr nuclei with ambient gas . however , the relative contributions of the first two processes with respect to the @xmath1 decays is uncertain @xcite , thus leading to a considerable uncertainty in a physical interpretation of the observed galactic @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .",
    "the situation is similarly difficult for individual sources of gev - to - tev @xmath0-rays , which may have been produced in hadronic interactions or leptonic processes like inverse compton scattering .",
    "the most notable examples of sources difficult to interpret are agn jets @xcite and recently observed shell - type snr s @xcite .",
    "exact knowledge of the @xmath0-ray source spectrum resulting from hadronic interactions is thus of prime importance for a proper physical interpretation .",
    "the production of neutral pions and their subsequent decay to @xmath0-rays is thought to be the principal mechanism for the @xmath0-ray hadronic component in cosmic ray interactions , and a number of parameterizations have been developed over the years that thus describe @xmath0-ray production in @xmath4-collision @xcite .",
    "in addition to the neutral pion production , however , the direct @xmath0-ray production in cosmic - ray interaction was found important @xcite , as was the production of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 particles , all of which eventually decay into @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "also , the helium nuclei in cosmic rays and the interstellar medium are expected to contribute about 20 - 30% to the secondary production in cosmic - ray interactions , for which the multiplicity spectra may be different .",
    "the purpose of this work is to carefully study the @xmath0-ray production from individual decay processes , including the direct production , in cosmic - ray interactions . for that purpose",
    "we employ the event generator dpmjet - iii @xcite to simulate secondary productions in both p - generated and he - generated interactions .",
    "we include all relevant secondary particles with @xmath0-rays as the final decay products .",
    "for the cosmic rays , protons and helium nuclei are taken into account . the composition the ism we assume as 90% protons , 10% helium nuclei , 0.02% carbon , and 0.04% oxygen . at energies below 20 gev , where dpmjet appears unreliable , we combine the simulation results with a parametric model of @xmath1 production @xcite , that includes the resonances @xmath8(1232 ) and @xmath8(1600 ) , thus deriving a @xmath0-ray production matrix for cosmic rays with energies up to about 10 pev that can be easily used to interpret the spectra of cosmic @xmath0-ray sources .    as examples we use the @xmath0-ray production matrix to interpret the observed spectra of diffuse galactic emission and of one particular supernova remnant .",
    "we calculate the spectrum of diffuse galactic @xmath0-rays and find , as other groups did before @xcite , that the gev excess is probably not the result of an inappropriate model of hadronic @xmath0-ray production .",
    "we also test the hypothesis that the tev - band @xmath0-ray emission of the shell - type snr rx j1713 - 3946 , that was observed with hess , is caused by hadronic cosmic rays that have a spectrum according to current theories of cosmic - ray modified shock acceleration .",
    "the @xmath1 production and subsequent decays are thought to be one of the most principal @xmath0-ray production mechanisms in high - energy astrophysics .",
    "the @xmath1 production in @xmath4-collisions was well studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "however , all the current available models have met an applicability limit : the isospin model @xcite , considering the relation @xmath9 , is found to be too simplified by comparison with accelerator data @xcite for incident proton energies from tens of gev to a few hundred of gev , and the parameterized @xmath10 and @xmath11 production cross sections in proton - induced nuclear collisions are found to deviate from the experimental data at the incident proton energy @xmath12 gev or at the transverse momentum @xmath13 gev / c @xcite ; the scaling model prediction @xcite is found to give a poor fit in both differential and total cross sections at low energy @xmath14 gev @xcite , and it was also shown @xcite that the kinematic limit of this model is incorrect at energy @xmath15 gev ; the isobar model @xcite is found superior but is valid only from threshold up to a few gev @xcite .",
    "in addition to the theoretical approach , the parametrization of the inclusive cross section of @xmath1 production in @xmath4-collisions based on the accelerator data was also studied @xcite .",
    "the validity of a parametrization depends on the functional formulae chosen and also the data used to determine the free parameters .",
    "thus , the parametrization method often re - produces tails extending beyond the energy - momentum conservation limit , which might result in unphysical structures when the spectrum is calculated in a broad energy range .",
    "it is recognized @xcite that these parameterizations lose accuracy in the high energy regime and come with a kinematic limit of validity .",
    "the parametrization of stephens and badhwar @xcite under - predicts the yield of high energy pions . the work of blattnig _ et al .",
    "@xcite is valid only for energies @xmath16 below 50 gev , and above this energy it extremely over - predicts the pion production and carries a kinematic invalidity ; kamae _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have exercised much care in determining the inclusive cross section near the pion production threshold , but the same problems with kinematic invalidities , etc , arise in the high energy range .",
    "the spectral distribution of secondary particles and the total cross section are not directly obtainable due to the lack of data .",
    "nevertheless , one can calculate the energy spectrum or total inclusive cross section by integrating the parameterized differential inclusive cross section over the whole phase space ( the scattering angle and the energy ) . by analyzing the behavior of the integral , it is possible to evaluate the accuracy and validity limit of different parameterizations .",
    "for example , by the analysis of the total cross section , a parametrization which can not integrate to a correct total cross section can be ruled out , even though the invariant differential cross section data can be reproduced , since the global behavior of the parametrization is not accurate . on the other hand ,",
    "producing a correct total cross section upon integration does nt necessarily imply accuracy of the global behavior of this parametrization .",
    "this disadvantage results from the fact that the available data are not sufficiently constraining the parametrization of differential cross sections .      in particle physics , the monte carlo simulation approach",
    "is widely applied to obtain information on particle production in hadronic interactions .",
    "the principle advantage of using the monte carlo method is that the codes can be used directly for calculations of all secondary products .",
    "however , it is quite useful to have simple representations to investigate the fundamental spectral characteristics . in this work , the monte carlo event generator , dpmjet - iii , is used to simulate the secondary production in cosmic - ray generated hadronic interactions .",
    "the monte carlo event generator dpmjet @xcite , is constructed for sampling hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus , nucleus - nucleus and neutrino - nucleus interactions from a few gev up to very high energies .",
    "dpmjet is an implementation of the two - component dual parton model for the description of interactions involving nuclei , including photonproduction and deep inelastic scattering off nuclei .",
    "it is based on the gribov - glauber approach and treats both soft and hard scattering processes in an unified way .",
    "soft processes are parameterized according to the regge - phenomenology whereas lowest - order perturbative qcd is used to simulate the hard component .",
    "multiple - parton interactions in each individual hadron / nucleon / photon - nucleon interaction are described by the phojet event generator .",
    "the fragmentation of parton configurations is treated by the lund model pythia .    as a new feature ,",
    "dpmjet - iii allows the simulation of enhanced graph cuts in non - diffractive inelastic hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions .",
    "for example , in an event with two wounded nucleons , the first nucleon might take part in a non - diffractive interaction whereas the second one scatters diffractively producing only very few secondaries .",
    "further features of dpmjet - iii are a formation - zone intranuclear cascade and the implementation of certain baryon stoppings .",
    "dpmjet - iii and earlier versions such as dpmjet - ii have been extensively tested against data in hadron  nucleus and nucleus  nucleus collisions @xcite , for the simulation of cosmic - ray air shower problems @xcite , and for the atmospheric @xmath0-ray and neutrino production @xcite .",
    "although dpmjet has reproduced well the experimental data in hadronic collisions over a quite broad incident energy range , it appears to produce unphysical structure near the threshold energy of pion production .",
    "figure  [ fig : dpmjetxsection ] shows the @xmath1 and @xmath17 production cross sections in function of the kinetic energy of protons in @xmath4-collisions simulated by dpmjet - iii .",
    "the experimental values are taken from references @xcite up to @xmath18 . to be noted from the figure",
    "is that the dpmjet results agree with the data except the energy range @xmath19 . for a high - energy physics event generator",
    "this is not uncommon behavior .",
    "the energy region in question corresponds to the resonance region relating to the nuclear cascades in the nuclear interactions .",
    "the contribution from the baryon resonances , either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , has a very narrow spike - like characteristic at energies close to pion production threshold , and is sometimes added by hand to parameterizations of the differential cross section @xcite .",
    "we therefore use the parameterizations @xcite including pion production and resonance production below a total energy @xmath22 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the production is given by the dpmjet - iii simulation ; for @xmath24 , it is purely parametric with resonance production included ; for @xmath25 , a linear combination in energy is used to transition from the parametrization to the dpmjet - iii results .",
    "the final production spectra of secondary particles are smooth and still retain agreement with experimental data .",
    "we use dpmjet to calculate energy - dependent weight factors , that allow us to parametrically account for @xmath26 and @xmath27 collisions in the parametrization approach , that has been strictly derived for @xmath28 collisions only .",
    "the weights show no strong dependence on energy of the projectile particle .",
    "a remark is in order drawn on the parametrization of pion production , that we use at low cosmic - ray energies .",
    "the functional form of the pion multiplicity spectra violates kinematic limits , so typically a few percent of pions appear to have energies higher than possible .",
    "a truncation of the multiplicity spectra at the kinematic limit would modify the mean energy of pions , thus changing the @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "as the parametrization is a best fit to data , any modification would in principle deteriorate the fit .",
    "we therefore decided not to correct for the violation of kinematic limits .",
    "the isobar model is based on the theory that @xmath29 production in @xmath28 collisions near the threshold is mediated by the excitation of the @xmath30 isobar , which subsequently decays into a nucleon and pions . in this work , the produced isobar is assumed to carry momentum directly forward and backward in the center - of - mass system of the collisions with an equal probability , and then decays isotropically into a nucleon and @xmath1 s .",
    "the decay modes and decay fractions for resonances are considered as follows based on the particle data group .",
    "* @xmath31 ; * @xmath32 ; * @xmath33 ; * @xmath34 ; * @xmath35 ; * @xmath36 ; * @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath1 contribution from resonances is then added to the non - resonant @xmath1 production .",
    "while running the dpmjet - iii , all secondary particles produced in simulated hadronic interactions are recorded .",
    "the following decay modes shows all the decay processes of secondary products with @xmath0-rays as the final decay particles that are taken into account in the current work .",
    "* baryonic decays : * * @xmath38 ; * * @xmath39 ; * * @xmath40 ; * * @xmath41 .",

    "figure  [ fig : decayspectra ] shows the energy spectra of @xmath0-rays contributed from each type of secondary particles produced in p+ism interactions for two different incident proton energies : 150 gev ( upper curve ) and 10 tev ( lower curve ) . the ism composition is taken as 90% protons , 10% helium nuclei , 0.02% carbon , and 0.04% oxygens .",
    "for ease of comparison , baryonic ( left ) and mesonic ( right ) decay contributions are separately shown .",
    "the total energy spectra of @xmath0-rays ( the sum of each contribution ) , the directly produced @xmath0-ray photons in the hadronic collisions and the @xmath0-rays from @xmath1 decays are also plotted in each figure for comparison . to be noted in the figures",
    "is that , in addition to @xmath1 decays , the directly produced @xmath0-ray photons appear more important than other mesons and baryons over almost the whole energy domain .",
    "however , the secondary mesons contribute more at the peak of the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "integrated over the @xmath0-ray spectrum , the other secondary particles have contributed about 20% @xmath0-ray photons relative to the @xmath1 decays .",
    "some authors @xcite suggested that a few percent of @xmath0-rays should be contributed by decays of @xmath7 mesons , but no @xmath7 meson is listed in dpmjet read - out table .",
    "this is due to the fact that with our simulation setup , the @xmath7 mesons have already decayed and only their decay products are listed .",
    "we have verified that the @xmath7 mesons are properly accounted for by performing test runs under different pythia parameters , so the @xmath7-decay is avoided .",
    "another independent verification arises from the very small contribution to @xmath49 and @xmath50 pairs from @xmath7 decays , which are found consistent within the statistical uncertainty with all @xmath7-mesons having decayed .",
    "the energy loss resulting from the inelastic production collisions can be determined by integrating over the yield in all secondary particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : edote ] shows the energy loss rate as function of the incident particle energy in the @xmath26 collisions . to be noted from the figure is that the energy loss rate gradually increases with energy above 10 gev on account of an increasing importance of secondary particles other than pions .",
    "the thick dashed curve in the figure is a functional approximation to the energy loss rate in @xmath26 production collisions over the entire energy range described as @xmath51 to be noted is that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : edot ] ) is a functional approximation introduced earlier for pion production up to 100 gev @xcite .",
    "this term is a good approximation below 100 gev where pions are the dominant secondary product .",
    "for the cosmic - ray hadronic interactions and the subsequent decays , the spectrum of a final secondary particle is described by @xmath52 with @xmath53 defined as the differential density of cr particles ( @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) .",
    "the differential cross section of a secondary particle produced in the @xmath56 collision is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the inelastic production cross section , whose value is simulated by dpmjet , and @xmath59 is the multiplicity spectrum of the secondary particle in question .    we can follow the decay of unstable secondary particles into @xmath0-rays , which is a purely kinematical problem , and thus obtain the @xmath0-ray spectrum from secondary - particle decay generated by a cosmic - ray particle with energy @xmath60 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the @xmath0-ray spectrum resulting from the initial multiplicity spectrum of the secondary particle species @xmath63 or the directly produced @xmath0-ray spectrum in cosmic - ray generated interactions .",
    "if the total energy of cosmic - ray particles ( @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) is parameterized as @xmath64 and the @xmath0-ray energy is sampled as @xmath65 both with sufficient energy resolution , then the production integral , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaspectra ] ) , can be written as a sum .",
    "@xmath66 the problem is thus reduced to a matrix operation , in which a vector , that describes the cosmic - ray flux at various energies according to eq .",

    "( [ eq : ecr ] ) , and the @xmath0-ray energy spectrum matrix @xmath69 .",

    "in addition to the @xmath0-ray production matrix , we have also produced the production matrices of all particles that are stable on a time scale relevant for cosmic - ray propagation , namely @xmath73 .      with this production matrix",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0-ray spectra for two examples of cosmic - ray spectra : a simple power - law spectrum and a power - law spectrum with an energy cutoff : @xmath74 @xmath60 being the cosmic - ray total energy and both assuming the cosmic - ray composed of protons and helium nuclei .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammaspectracrpowerlaw ] shows the energy spectra of @xmath0-rays contributed by the secondaries produced in @xmath75 interactions with a simple power - law cosmic - ray spectral distribution described in ( [ eq : crspectrapowerlaw ] ) . figure  [ fig : gammaspectracrcutoff ] shows the same as figure  [ fig : gammaspectracrpowerlaw ] but with an energy cutoff in cosmic - ray spectrum at @xmath76 .",

    "the @xmath1 decay is the dominant component in the diffuse @xmath0-rays spectrum , however , at least about 20% of the @xmath0-ray photons result from secondary products other than pions , including the direct @xmath0-ray production . with the energy cutoff in cosmic - ray spectrum",
    ", it is found that the @xmath0-ray spectrum is modified also at energies below 1  tev , where the spectra in figure  [ fig : gammaspectracrcutoff ] are notably softer than those shown in fig  [ fig : gammaspectracrpowerlaw ] .",
    "this is because the multiplicity spectrum of a secondary particle has a long tail , and a high energy cosmic - ray particle can generate several generations of production collisions , multiplying the production at lower energies .",
    "the observed gev - bump in diffuse @xmath0-ray spectrum @xcite is a long - term standing mystery in @xmath0-ray astrophysics .",
    "both hadronic and leptonic scenarios have been proposed to explain the gev excess",
    ". a harder spectrum of cosmic - ray nucleons is required for @xmath0-rays of nucleonic origin to account for the observed intensity in the multi - gev range @xcite , without violation of the observed intensity at a few hundred mev . however , significant variations of the cosmic - ray spectrum in the galaxy are unlikely @xcite",
    ". strong fluctuations in the spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons must be expected , though @xcite : electrons are accelerated by snr with power - law spectra of index -2.0 or similar , but severe energy losses prevent them from homogeneously filling the galaxy . a hard spectral component from inverse compton scatterings",
    "could then explain the gev bump in the diffuse @xmath0-rays .",
    "it has also been argued that both a harder electron and a harder nucleon spectrum may be required to reproduce the gev excess @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gevbump ] shows the observed gev - band @xmath0-ray emission from the inner galaxy in comparison with the contributions from @xmath1 decay as well as bremsstrahlung emission , which we here describe by a power - law spectrum @xmath77 such that @xmath78 with power - law spectral index @xmath79 , the electron energy density @xmath80 , and the gas column density @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the generating cosmic - rays are assumed with an energy density @xmath82 .",
    "models based on the locally observed cosmic - ray spectra generally predict a softer spectrum for the leptonic components , even after accounting for inverse compton emission @xcite , so we may in fact overestimate the gev - band intensity of the leptonic contribution .",
    "nevertheless , it is clearly seen in this figure , that in the total intensity an over - shooting around @xmath83 appears in the modelled @xmath0-ray energy distribution , whereas a deficit is present above 1  gev .",
    "the observed spectrum of diffuse emission is always harder than the model spectrum , and we therefore conclude that an inaccurate description of hadronic @xmath0-rays is ruled out as the origin of the gev excess , in line with earlier work @xcite .",
    "as snr s are believed to be the main sources of galactic cosmic rays , it is worth testing whether or not the observed @xmath0-ray spectra from snr can be well modelled in terms of hadronic interactions .",
    "the @xmath0-ray production matrix presented in this paper is a valuable tool in such an analysis .",
    "the hess collaboration has measured the tev - band gamma - ray spectrum of the shell - type snr rx  j1713.7 - 3946 over more than two decades in energy and in approximately ten angular resolution elements per diameter @xcite .",
    "the data we use here consist of 25 independent spectral flux measurement for the entire remnant , taken with the complete hess array in 2004 . since snr rx  j1713.7 - 3946 appears closely associated with dense molecular clouds along the line of sight @xcite , it is reasonable to expect a strong signal of hadronic @xmath0-rays .",
    "given the integrated flux in the tev band , for the hadronic scenario the required total energy in accelerated cosmic - ray nucleons is @xmath84 there is kinematic evidence that the distance @xmath85 is @xmath86  kpc @xcite , whereas the weakness of thermal x - ray emission implies a density of @xmath87 in the center of the remnant @xcite and a postshock density of @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the low postshock density indicates that about 1 solar mass or less have been swept up by the snr , which therefore should just be in transition from the adiabatic phase to the taylor - sedov phase , when its ability to accelerate particles is presumable at its peak .",
    "the low density also implies a total energy in cosmic rays of about @xmath89  erg , somewhat larger than the canonical value for the total kinetic energy in a supernova explosion .",
    "a high energy density of energetic particles is in line with the notion of fermi - type acceleration at the forward shock of snr .",
    "this process is intrinsically efficient , and a significant fraction of the pressure and energy density will be carried by energetic particles . in that case",
    "the shocks should be strongly modified , because the energetic particles have a smaller adiabatic index and a much larger mean free path for scattering than does the quasi - thermal plasma .",
    "in addition the particles at the highest energy escape , thus making the shock essentially radiative and increasing the compression ratio @xcite .    while the details of the published acceleration models differ , they essentially all predict a continuous hardening of the particle spectrum with increasing energy , until a cut - off occurs at an energy that is difficult to predict @xcite . at particle energies in excess of 1  tev , i.e. relevant for @xmath0-ray production above 200  gev",
    ", the spectrum should be harder than @xmath90 and display a positive curvature , unless the cut - off has already set in @xcite .",

    "the cut - off energy , @xmath96 , is a free parameter , but should be @xmath97  pev , if snr are to produce galactic cosmic rays up to the knee at a few pev , because rx  j1713.7 - 3946 appears to already turn into the sedov phase . for cosmic - ray modified shocks we would expect @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the normalization , @xmath100 , is not a parameter in our analysis , because we normalize both the data and the model to their value at 0.97  tev , while propagating the flux error at that energy to the errors in the normalized flux at all other energies .",

    "the presently available upper limits from egret @xcite are too high to provide meaningful constraints and are therefore omitted here .",
    "more important than the best fit are the confidence ranges of parameters , for which the probability distributions follow a @xmath105 distribution in @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the number of parameters , for which the combined confidence volume is determined @xcite .",

    "is that a positive spectral curvature , @xmath99 , is excluded at more than 95% confidence .",

    "the best fit under those constraints achieved @xmath111 , higher than the unconstrained best fit by @xmath112 , which again demonstrates how much poorer the fit is for @xmath110 .",
    "the two parameters @xmath96 and @xmath94 would be slightly correlated with pivot point at @xmath113 and @xmath114  tev , so a lower cut - off energy would compensate for a harder power index and vice versa .",
    "nevertheless the cut - off energy would be @xmath115  tev with 99.7% confidence .",
    "these findings clearly demonstrate that a softening particle spectrum is statistically required , if the tev - band @xmath0-ray spectrum from rx  j1713.7 - 3946 is of hadronic origin .",
    "a more gradual decay of the spectrum is preferred over a hard cut - off . with the best - fit curvature @xmath103",

    "<S> in this work we study the individual contribution to diffuse @xmath0-ray emission from the secondary products in hadronic interactions generated by cosmic rays ( crs ) , in addition to the contribution of @xmath1 decay via the decay mode @xmath2 . for that purpose </S>",
    "<S> we employ the monte carlo particle collision code dpmjet3.04 to determine the multiplicity spectra of various secondary particles with @xmath0 s as the final decay state , that result from inelastic collisions between cosmic - ray protons and helium nuclei and the interstellar medium with standard composition . by combining the simulation results with a parametric model of @xmath0-ray production by cosmic rays with energies below a few gev , where dpmjet appears unreliable </S>",
    "<S> , we thus derive an easy - to - use @xmath0-ray production matrix for cosmic rays with energies up to about 10 pev .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply the @xmath0-ray production matrix to the gev excess in diffuse galactic @xmath0-rays observed by egret . </S>",
    "<S> although the non-@xmath1 decay components have contributed to the total emission with a different spectrum from the @xmath1-decay component , they are insufficient to explain the gev excess .    </S>",
    "<S> we also test the hypothesis that the tev - band @xmath0-ray emission of the shell - type snr rx j1713 - 3946 observed with hess is caused by shock - accelerated hadronic cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario implies a very high efficacy of particle acceleration , so the particle spectrum is expected to continuously harden toward high energies on account of cosmic - ray modification of the shock . using the @xmath3 statistics we find that a continuously softening spectrum is strongly preferred , in contrast to expectations . </S>",
