    "transversity was first discussed by ralston and soper @xcite , who suggested its measurement in the drell - yan ( dy ) process through the double transverse spin asymmetry @xmath3 integrated over the transverse momentum @xmath0 of the lepton pair and at measured @xmath0 @xmath2 , in particular at @xmath4 . at measured @xmath0",
    "there will be background contributions from transverse momentum dependence of partons , that have not yet been considered .",
    "the @xmath2 asymmetry was estimated to be at most 5% @xcite , based on the upper bound on the transversity distribution .",
    "the first extraction @xcite indicates the quark transversity to be only half of its maximum value , which , if it also holds for the antiquarks , reduces the asymmetry to 1% , making a background study relevant .",
    "we will also study @xmath1-boson production , in which one expects zero contribution from transversity within the standard model @xcite .",
    "this allows for new physics studies as proposed in @xcite , where the maximal asymmetry was estimated to be around 1% , reinforcing the need for a background study .",
    "the two relevant tmd effects are the double sivers effect , which describes a transverse momentum distribution of quarks inside a transversely polarized hadron which is asymmetric w.r.t .  the spin direction @xcite and another effect that was first discussed by ralston and soper @xcite , which describes the distribution of longitudinally polarized quarks inside a transversely polarized hadron .",
    "both effects are described by a transverse momentum dependent parton distribution ( tmd ) : the sivers effect by a tmd often denoted by @xmath5 @xcite and the other by @xmath6 @xcite also referred to as worm - gear ( wg ) function .",
    "the expressions for the double sivers and double wg effect for dy have been given in ref .",
    "one can consider the so - called collins - soper ( cs ) frame , which allows one to distinguish the double transverse spin asymmetries arising from transversity , the sivers effect and the wg effect by their lepton azimuthal angular dependence .",
    "however , in the laboratory frame , all three effects will contribute to the same angular distribution .",
    "the lab frame is thus theoretically not the preferred frame to extract the transversity distribution , but it is experimentally more ` direct ' to do so .",
    "in fact , in @xmath1-boson production with a leptonic decay , it is virtually impossible to transform to the cs frame due to the unobserved neutrino .",
    "this makes the lab frame experimentally the most desirable frame to measure spin asymmetries . to study the impact of the sivers and wg effect on such a measurement",
    ", we will present quantitatively the size of the spin asymmetries _ in the lab frame _ caused by partonic transverse momentum effects in both the dy process and @xmath1-boson production .",
    "a factorization between @xmath7 and @xmath8 dependence and a gaussian dependence on @xmath7 will be assumed , i.e. we use for the unpolarized parton distribution @xmath9 with the value of the width @xmath10 , fitted by @xcite .",
    "for the sivers function , we will use the extraction obtained by @xcite .",
    "a determination of the worm - gear distribution based on fits of experimental data is not available , so we will employ a model for this wg function .",
    "we will use a gaussian ansatz in terms of its first transverse moment , i.e.@xmath11 for the width we will take a value in accordance with the bag model @xcite @xmath12 and for the first moment , we will use a wandzura - wilczek type approximation @xcite to express it in terms of the known helicity distribution @xmath13 by @xmath14 the resulting functions agree with model calculations and lattice evaluations , see @xcite for details . for numerical estimations",
    "the dssv helicity distribution @xcite is used .",
    "we will define a spin flip symmetric and antisymmetric cross section as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath0 , total momentum @xmath15 and rapidity @xmath16 of the lepton pair and the lepton azimuthal angle @xmath17 ( measured w.r.t .",
    "the spin plane ) in the laboratory frame by @xmath18 two double transverse spin asymmetries will be defined , @xmath19 which select out the @xmath17 independent part of the cross section and the part @xmath20 . the double sivers effect contribution to both these asymmetries",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ attdy1 ] , the share coming from the wg effect is left out being negligible compared to this . for detailed expressions",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 asymmetry reaches up to the percent level , but only for large @xmath22 outside the range of interest , whereas the @xmath23 asymmetry receives a contribution at the level of @xmath24 from the double sivers effect and @xmath25 from the double wg effect .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath23 is bounded by the maximal value of @xmath21 , irrespective of the parameterization used for tmd distributions .",
    "therefore , as a cross - check of the smallness of the tmd background , one can verify that the @xmath21 asymmetry is indeed much smaller .",
