    "the distribution function is proportional to @xmath18 , which implies that adjacent energy levels can not approach each other indefinitely because of mixing between two extended states .",
    "since @xmath19 for @xmath17 for the symplectic ensemble , the level repulsion in this ensemble is strongest amongst the three classes . in the insulating regime , mixing of quantum states belonging to adjacent levels can be ignored and the energy levels are uncorrelated .",
    "consequently , the level - spacing distribution function obeys the poissonian , @xmath20 the poisson distribution for the insulating phase and the three kinds of wigner - dyson distribution functions for the metallic phase have been confirmed numerically in two and three dimensions .",
    "@xcite    in addition to these two types of distribution functions , there exists the third distribution at the critical point of the anderson transition .",
    "@xcite a critical wavefunction percolates over the whole system in a multifractal manner reflecting no characteristic length scales , and the spatial profile of the wavefunction is similar to neither extended nor localized states .",
    "@xcite since the level statistics are governed by wavefunction profiles,@xcite the critical level statistics are expected to be different from both @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , it has been numerically elucidated that the critical level - spacing distribution can not be expressed by either eq .",

    ", two types of ingenuities have been proposed .",
    "one is to set the power - law interaction @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the localization length exponent.@xcite this leads the critical distribution function proportional to @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",

    "another attempt is to construct a random - matrix ensemble with a log - squared potential @xmath35.@xcite using such a non - gaussian random - matrix ensemble , nishigaki has obtained a differential equation for the critical distribution @xmath0.@xcite although the numerical solution of this differential equation well reproduces the critical distribution @xmath0 calculated by exact diagonalizations , the theory contains an ambiguous parameter @xmath36 and the closed form of @xmath0 remains to be unknown .",
    "thus the analytical form of @xmath0 at the anderson transition is still unclear .",
    "these arguments on @xmath0 are based on the assumption that all of critical states are multifractal characterized by an entire spectrum comprising infinitely many exponents .",
    "recently , it has , however , been shown @xcite that anomalously localized states ( als ) @xcite in which most of amplitudes concentrate on a narrow spatial region exist _ with a finite probability in infinite systems _ at the anderson transition point .",
    "als are brought by statistical fluctuations in disorder realizations and show no multifractality because of the characteristic length of large amplitude regions .",
    "it should be noted that typical states are kept to be multifractal in critical systems .",
    "when studying statistical properties of physical quantities defined at the critical point , one should take notice of the influence of als.@xcite in particular , als make a significant contribution to distribution functions of critical quantities .",
    "if the level - spacing distribution @xmath0 calculated at the critical point is strongly affected by als , there is a possibility that @xmath0 for level pairs of typical wavefunctions might be totally different from that obtained numerically so far .",
    "it follows that the contribution of als should be eliminated from a simulation result for checking numerically the validity of an analytical expression of @xmath0 at criticality .",
    "this is because previous theoretical arguments are essentially based on the random matrix theory which does not allow the existence of als .    in this paper , we study numerically the influence of als to the level - spacing distribution function at the anderson transition .",
    "energy levels and their corresponding wavefunctions at the critical point are prepared in two - dimensional symplectic systems described by the su(2 ) model.@xcite by employing our recently proposed definition of als at criticality , we distinguish als from typical multifractal states ( ms ) and construct als ( ms ) level - pair ensembles which contains only pairs of energy levels corresponding to als ( ms ) .",
