    "recent experiments on superconducting films revealed a giant peak in the low temperature magnetoresistance with the growth from several times ( in polycrystalline samples@xcite ) to several orders of magnitude ( in amorphous films@xcite ) , as compared to the value near the superconductor - insulator transition , and the re - entrant drop upon further increase of magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field - induced insulating phase and the related superconductor - insulator transition are long known , and extensive theoretical and experimental efforts@xcite resulted in a remarkable progress in understanding many features of these phenomena . yet the observed giant peak in magnetoresistance is puzzling and poses a challenge for theory .",
    "theoretical models@xcite suggested possible development of spatial inhomogeneities in amorphous samples and indicated the role they may play in formation of the resistivity maximum.@xcite consequences of the existence of the superconductor islands network were explored by the numerical studies in ref .  ; the computed behavior of magnetoresistance was in a qualitative agreement with the experiment .    in the present paper we propose and investigate a model for polycrystalline and/or granular films which offers a mechanism leading to the giant peak in the magnetoresistance .",
    "we model the superconducting film in a strong magnetic field as an array of alternating superconducting ( s ) and normal ( n ) granules and demonstrate that the superconducting insulator ( si ) phase appears in the strong coupling regime . in real multi - disperse films the formation of a network of s and n grains occurs naturally as a consequence of the spatial variations of the single grain critical fields that inevitably appear due to dispersion of grains sizes . magnetic field close to the average single - grain critical field drives about a half of the grains into a normal state , giving rise to the network of s and n granules , see fig .  [ array ] .",
    "even at a strong intergranular coupling , this array is subject to the coulomb blockade ( similar to a single sn junction@xcite ) , leading to the insulating state of the sample . varying the magnetic field results in the change of the relative fraction of the s and n grains .",
    "note that the `` standard '' model of an array of identical s granules@xcite can not describe the formation of an insulating state in the regime of a strong intergranular coupling .",
    "the charging energy of a single grain is renormalized@xcite down to the values @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the order parameter in a single grain and @xmath2 is the intergranular tunneling conductance .",
    "the josephson coupling @xmath3 if @xmath4 , and this results in the superconducting rather than the insulating state.@xcite        we consider the case where most of the grains are so small that the zeeman effect is at least of the same order as the orbital one , and , as a result , the transition between the superconducting and normal states within a single grain is of the first order.@xcite such samples are the good candidates for demonstrating the si phase since the applied strong magnetic field @xmath5 close to the clogston field @xmath6 will form a strongly inhomogeneous mixture of s and n grains with the order parameter in the s granules close to that in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath7 .     in coordinates",

    "varying the grain size one crosses the line of the phase transition which at strong enough fields is indeed always of the first order .",
    "we now recall a well known result of the percolation theory that in the site problem for the two - dimensional black and white alternate square ( or honeycomb ) lattice there exists a range of the relative concentrations of the sites where simultaneously neither black nor white sites percolate.@xcite in our model , such a `` no - percolation '' state inevitably leads to transport via sequences of sn junctions ; this is an essential ingredient for explaining the si phase . to capture this qualitative fact and at the same time to simplify the calculations",
    ", we consider a system with the checkerboard arrangement of the s and n granules .",
    "we show that the applied strong magnetic field , close to the clogston field @xmath15 , causes the formation of an insulating state with the gap in the electron excitation spectrum given by @xmath16 where @xmath2 is the tunneling conductance@xcite ( in units of @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is the single grain charging energy .",
    "this suggests the conductivity behavior @xmath19 equation  ( [ result1 ] ) is obtained in the approximation of the nearest neighbor tunneling between the grains .    to verify whether the higher - order tunneling processes can indeed be neglected , we analyze ( i )  electron tunneling between two n grains via a virtual state in an s grain and ( ii )  cooper pair tunneling between s grains via an n grain .",
    "small amplitudes of these processes ensure the stability of the insulating state with respect to formation of the metallic and superconducting state , respectively . analyzing the corresponding corrections",
    "we show that the insulating state is stable as long as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mean energy level spacing in a single grain .",
    "since the ratio @xmath23 is large ( otherwise even the mean field approximation for a single grain can not be used ) , @xmath24 is larger than the critical value @xmath25 that marks the onset of strong coulomb correlations in the two - dimensional granular array in the absence of superconductivity .",
    "@xcite thus , for samples with intergranular conductance laying within the interval @xmath26 the insulating state is indeed induced by the local superconducting correlations .",

    "now we discuss the relation between our results and experimental data of refs .   and  .",
    "a note in order is that the proposed model of a granular superconductor in the vicinity of a superconductor - insulator transition as an normal / superconductor granules alternating chessboard seems to capture adequately general features of the systems of real morphology and , therefore , allows for the comparison with the experimental data within its range of applicability .",
    "our results hold for conductances @xmath105 , where the critical conductance @xmath106 is given by eq .",
    "( [ g_c ] ) .",
    "this implies that the value of a film conductance @xmath2 may be less than unity in real experiment .",
    "the resistance of the samples used in experiments of refs .   and   was of the order of 20  k@xmath35 , which corresponds to the dimensionless conductance @xmath107 , i.e. , falling on the boundary of applicability of our theory .",
    "yet one can hope that our results can be used as a crude estimate .    in ref .",
    ", the data showing a noticeable peak in magnetoresistance were presented only for the high resistivity samples .",
    "the maximum resistance does not demonstrate the activation dependence on temperature .",
    "apparently our theory does not apply to this case , presumably due to low intergranular tunneling conductance .",
    "next , our theory is developed for granular systems and therefore should not apply to homogeneously amorphous samples .",
    "however , it is possible that realistic samples do not exactly correspond to one of the two limiting cases .",
    "for example , amorphous samples can be not uniformly disordered but rather consisting of separate regions ( due to fluctuations of chemical composition or impurity concentration ) favoring superconductivity . in this case",
    "the system reminds the granular samples studied in the present paper .    keeping this possibility in mind",
    ", we make estimates for the experiment of ref .  , where amorphous ino samples were investigated .",
    "we note that in the case of ino films the formation of the `` superconducting insulator '' state was observed in the samples where the values of the resistance at high magnetic fields , while falling into the metallic domain , were close to the critical resistance that separates insulating and metallic phases at @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the estimate of the gap @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ result1 ] ) requires taking @xmath109 . plugging this into eq .",
    "( [ result1 ] ) , we obtain the gap @xmath110 within the logarithmic accuracy , the ratio of the logarithms is about unity .",
    "finally , in order to compare our estimate with the experimental findings , we express the superconducting gap @xmath7 in the absence of the magnetic field through the critical temperature @xmath111 . using the standard relation @xmath112 , we arrive at the estimate @xmath113 or , equivalently , @xmath114 , which certainly is in a reasonable agreement with the experiment .",
    "indeed , according to fig .  4 of ref .  ,",
    "the ratio @xmath115 depending on the sample varies between 0.6 and 3 .",
    "bearing in mind that our model was strictly speaking designed for granular samples , one can hardly expect a better agreement .",
    "here we comment on the conductivity behavior in the vicinity of the magnetization peak : at lower magnetic fields the concentration of the superconducting component increases resulting in the formation of the direct josephson coupling between the superconducting grains . the cooper pair gap @xmath99 decreases and eventually becomes smaller than the electron gap @xmath74 . at the same time",
    "there is no reason for the strong suppression of the electron gap due to the josephson coupling .",
    "thus , closer to the insulator to superconductor ( is ) transition at finite but low temperatures , the transport is mediated by the activation of _ cooper pairs _ rather than by the single electron excitations , hence @xmath116 at @xmath117 .",
    "thus , we expect that the resistivity within the is transition may be described within the effective bose model as in ref .  .",
    "at the opposite side of the magnetoresistance peak ( i.e. , at higher fields ) the fraction of the normal component increases leading to the direct coupling of normal grains .",
    "this results@xcite in the decrease of the electron gap @xmath74 and eventually in the destruction of the insulating state .",
    "note that for the si state which we studied the spatial orientation of the applied magnetic field was not essential , however closer to the is transition one expects it to become important .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have investigated formation of an insulating state ( corresponding to a giant peak in the magnetoresistance ) in a two - dimensional granular array with alternating superconducting and normal granules .",
    "we have demonstrated that this model is a good representation for realistic granular ( or polycrystalline ) systems with the grain size dispersion in a strong magnetic field .",
