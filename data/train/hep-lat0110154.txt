    "glashow model has two phases : when the mass parameter of the higgs field is negative , the su(2 ) gauge symmetry is broken into u(1 ) , and when it is positive the symmetry is unbroken .",
    "the phase of the system can be determined by a local measurement of , say , the scalar field @xmath0 , which vanishes in the symmetric phase but is non - zero in the broken phase .",
    "in the broken phase , the field equations have a topologically non - trivial solution , the t  hooft  polyakov monopole  @xcite , whose energy is concentrated around a point - like core .",
    "the mass , , the total energy carried by a monopole , decreases when the mass parameter approaches zero from below , and vanishes in the symmetric phase , in the sense that the solution is indistinguishable from the trivial vacuum solution .    in many cases , however , we are more interested in the behaviour of the model when fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "it is immaterial whether the fluctuations are thermal fluctuations in a classical field theory or quantum fluctuations in a wick  rotated ( 2 + 1)dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "both of these systems are described by the same partition function , and we shall make no distinction between them .",
    "nevertheless , we shall call the treatment based on classical field equations `` semiclassical '' even though it is no more accurate in a classical field theory at a non - zero temperature than it is in a quantum field theory .    when fluctuations are present , the above simple picture changes completely . in particular , the ` symmetric ' and ` broken ' phases",
    "are believed to be analytically connected to each other  @xcite .",
    "order parameter candidates that are not gauge invariant , such as @xmath1 , vanish in both phases , and positive definite observables , such as @xmath0 mentioned above , are non - zero in both phases .",
    "it would seem natural that a quantity like the mass of a t  hooft  polyakov monopole , however , should be protected against the effects of the fluctuations by its topology , and that it should therefore serve as an order parameter for the phase transition . if this were the case , the phases could not be analytically connected .",
    "one example of this is the abelian higgs model , in which the vortex tension indeed acts as an order parameter  @xcite .    on the other hand , it is not even obvious that the monopole mass can be given a rigorous definition in a fluctuating theory , because , in general , one can not assume that the field configurations that contribute to the partition function are in some sense close to solutions of classical field equations .",
    "this problem was solved in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , where the monopole mass was defined as the increase of the free energy when the total magnetic charge of the system is increased by one .",
    "furthermore , it was shown how this quantity can be measured in monte carlo simulations .",
    "thus , we have a well defined observable , the monopole mass , which could naturally be expected to be zero in the symmetric phase and non - zero in the broken phase , and still the phases are believed to be analytically connected .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explain this apparent paradox .",
    "first , we present a calculation based on a simple dilute monopole gas approximation , which predicts that although the monopole free energy is indeed non - zero and roughly equal to its classical value in a system of intermediate volume , it decays to zero at exponentially large volumes .",
    "therefore , it should actually vanish everywhere in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this calculation is very similar to polyakov s argument  @xcite that the photon has an exponentially small mass in the broken phase .",
    "second , we measure the monopole free energy directly in a monte carlo simulation on different volumes using the method developed in ref .",
    "we find that the monopole free energy has a volume - independent value in a wide range of lattice sizes , which shows that it corresponds to a localised , point - like object . in agreement with the analytical arguments , however , it eventually starts to decrease , when the volume is large enough .",
    "the vanishing of the monopole free energy in the infinite volume limit implies that the monopoles condense .",
    "this leads to confinement of electric charge according to the dual superconductor picture  @xcite , and our results can therefore be considered as a numerical verification of polyakov s semi - classical argument @xcite that the higgs phase is confining . in particular , since the monopole free energy vanishes in both phases in the infinite volume limit , it does not act as an order parameter , and this resolves the apparent paradox between a smooth crossover and the non - analytic behaviour of the monopole mass in the semiclassical approximation .    within the framework of high  temperature dimensional reduction @xcite , the three ",

    "glashow model is an effective theory for the yang ",
    "mills theory at high temperatures ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the phase transition of our model , however , is not related to the deconfinement phase transition of the yang  mills theory or qcd . on the other hand ,",
    "our methods can be generalised to four dimensions in a straightforward way , and they may therefore be applicable also to studying abelian monopoles @xcite in the yang ",
    "mills theory , in particular whether they condense at the transition point as has been suggested as a possible `` mechanism '' for confinement @xcite .",

    "@xcite a monopole creation operator was used , which lets one measure not only the mass but also correlation functions of the monopole field . with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", however , the operator creates not only a monopole , but also an antimonopole somewhere in the system in order to satisfy gauss s law .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that the system really has a non - zero magnetic charge , and because translation invariance is preserved , no singularities can arise even near the boundaries of the lattice .",

    "we shall treat this lattice theory as an approximation to the continuum one , and therefore we parameterise the theory in terms of the renormalised continuum couplings defined in eqs .",
    "( [ equ : xdef ] ) and ( [ equ : ydef ] ) .",
    "we are able to do this , because the relationships between the lattice and continuum couplings are known  @xcite , but we shall postpone discussion of them until section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we shall also express all quantities in continuum units .",
    "it is very well known that in the continuum , the field equations have topologically non - trivial solutions , t  hooft  polyakov monopoles @xcite .",
    "they can be characterised by a non - zero winding number of the higgs field at the spatial infinity , @xmath20 where @xmath21 . although @xmath22 itself is gauge invariant , the integrand is not , and therefore it does not have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "it can be easily seen , however , that @xmath22 actually corresponds to the magnetic charge associated with the residual u(1 ) gauge invariance .    to see this ,",
    "let us define the magnetic field as  @xcite @xmath23.\\ ] ] this is a gauge invariant quantity , and agrees with @xmath24 in the unitary gauge @xmath25 .",
    "therefore it is indeed the magnetic field associated with the residual u(1 ) symmetry . the corresponding magnetic charge density , @xmath26 , has the following properties : first , because @xmath27 is given by a total derivative",
    ", the charge inside a given volume can be expressed as a surface integral .",
    "therefore any local deformation of the fields inside the volume can not change the charge inside the volume .",
    "second , the magnetic charge inside a given volume is , in fact , @xmath28 and is therefore quantised in units of @xmath29 .",
    "these two properties imply that the only way the charge inside a volume can be changed is by moving a magnetic monopole in or out of the volume . in other words ,",
    "the magnetic charges are topologically stable .    what is less well known is that these same properties are also true for the lattice theory",
    ". we can define the analogue of eq .",

    "these are the same properties that ensure the stability of monopoles in the continuum , and thereby magnetic monopoles are well - defined and absolutely stable objects even in a discrete lattice theory , unlike the instantons of the four - dimensional yang - mills theory . because of the quantisation and stability of magnetic charge , it makes sense to consider ` microcanonical ' partition functions @xmath37 which are restricted to configurations with a given magnetic charge @xmath38 . the full , ` canonical ' partition function is then simply @xmath39 we define the free energy of a given topological sector by @xmath40 and the free energy of a monopole as the free energy difference of sectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 semiclassically , @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 is the action of the monopole solution with charge @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath46 can also be interpreted as the mass of a monopole , and with a slight abuse of language we can generalise into the fully non - perturbative case by defining the monopole ` mass ' @xmath47 by @xmath48 the semiclassical picture would predict that monopoles are massive in the broken phase and massless in the symmetric phase . if this were true , the mass would serve as an order parameter for the phase transition .",
    "we measure the monopole free energy following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , which for convenience we briefly review in this section .",
    "our strategy is to work on a finite sized system , and impose boundary conditions that force the total magnetic charge of the lattice to be either odd or even , whilst preserving the translation invariance of the system .",
    "this is important because translation invariance guarantees the absence of boundary effects .",
    "gauss s law rules out periodic boundary conditions , as the total charge is constrained to be zero .",
    "however , translation invariance is preserved by any boundary conditions that are periodic up to symmetries of the lagrangian , and in general they allow a non - zero magnetic charge .",
    "for instance , ` c  periodic boundary conditions ' @xcite @xmath49 are such that the net magnetic charge can be non - zero , but it is constrained to be even  @xcite .",

    "similarly , if the fields are constrained to behave as @xmath50 on moving around the lattice , the net magnetic charge is odd .",
    "we term these ` twisted ( c  periodic ) boundary conditions ' , and denote results so obtained by a subscript ` 1 ' .",

    "( [ equ : freeen1 ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ equ : bc ] ) with the translation invariant boundary conditions , the choice of coordinates @xmath55 does not affect any observable , and in particular , it does not fix the location of the monopole on the lattice .    in physical terms , @xmath56 gives a negative gauge coupling to three orthogonal stacks of plaquettes which are pierced by three mutually intersecting lines on the lattice .",
    "these lines are known in the literature as t  hooft lines  @xcite .",
    "a single , open t  hooft line creates a pair of dirac monopoles , and has been used to measure their interaction potential in refs .",
    "it should be noted , however , that dirac monopoles are rather different from t  hooft - polyakov monopoles .",
    "they have only half the magnetic charge of the latter , and are singular , non - dynamical objects . in our case ,",
    "the t  hooft lines are closed by the boundary conditions , and therefore they do not create any singularities , but a non - singular t  hooft  polyakov monopole .    the free energy @xmath57 ( or the ` mass ' ) of a monopole",
    "is defined by analogy with eq .",
    "( [ equ : fediff ] ) as @xmath58 in the main , however , we shall study the derivative of @xmath57 with respect to the scalar mass parameter , @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the volume of the system .",
    "we know that for sufficiently large @xmath59 in the symmetric phase the free energy of the monopole will go to zero ( at least in the large volume limit ) . if we see the derivative becoming zero , the free energy is at most a constant . in section  [ sec : numerics ] we also measure the free energy at a point in the symmetric phase and find it to be consistent with zero .",
    "if the derivative is zero all over the symmetric phase , it is reasonable to assume , then , that the free energy itself is becoming zero .",
    "we now turn our attention to the semi  classical predictions for the t hooft  polyakov monopole ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , to which we would like to compare our results from the fully quantised theory .    in the broken phase of the theory the scalar field",

    ", the scalar field decays towards its vev , with a characteristic length scale @xmath63 the gauge field simultaneously decays from being su(2 ) to being asymptotically u(1 ) with a length scale @xmath64 we thus have a picture where asymptotically the gauge fields are abelian , save within some extended core whose size is defined by the above length scales where the gauge fields ` unwind ' into the full su(2 ) gauge manifold .",
    "we shall find that this scenario remains at least qualitatively valid when quantum corrections are introduced .",
    "the mass of this object is , semiclassically , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the t hooft function . to satisfy the bogomolny lower bound on the mass , @xmath67",
    "also , it is known numerically ( see , for example , @xcite ) that for small @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",

    "( [ equ : mderiv ] ) , is @xmath70 assuming that the monopoles are point - like and non - interacting , we can roughly estimate their density to be @xcite @xmath71 which is suppressed by the exponential of the mass .",
    "we may also define a mean separation @xmath72 of the monopoles as @xmath73 when @xmath74 , there is a hierarchy between @xmath72 and the fundamental length scales @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and therefore the above assumption of point - like monopoles is valid .",
    "this is the semiclassical picture for infinite volume . what we are interested in is what happens in the quantised theory of finite volume , and the interplay of the system size , @xmath77 with the scales above",
    "particularly , we wish to know the fate of the monopole mass on large length scales .",
    "let us first briefly discuss what happens when the volume of the system is comparable to , or smaller than , the length scales discussed before .",
    "the core size of a monopole is given by the correlation length @xmath78 ( we assume for sake of argument that @xmath76 and @xmath75 are comparable ) , and therefore if @xmath79 , there is no room for a monopole in the system .",
    "if the system is forced by twisted boundary conditions to contain one monopole , its core will fill the lattice and the whole system will be in the confining phase .",
    "on the other hand , the untwisted system is in the higgs phase .",
    "the free energy densities of these two phases differ by a certain non - zero amount @xmath80 , which is essentially the latent heat , and as this is the case in the whole volume , we have @xmath81 thus , we can conclude that when @xmath82 , @xmath57 should scale as the volume of the system .",
    "when the volume is increased , @xmath83 , the fields start to approach the u(1 ) of the higgs vacuum far from the monopole core of the twisted system .",
    "nonetheless , the core will be affected by the boundary conditions , and in general a restriction in the core size by the boundary will lead to an increase in the ( absolute value of the ) free energy and its derivatives . as a rough estimate ,",
    "if the total non  abelian flux inside the monopole core is roughly constant , then the flux density will vary as the inverse of the volume .",
    "the total energy of the system would then vary as @xmath84 .",
    "( the figure @xmath85 is a rough limit derived from our results . )",
    "let us then consider a system that is large enough to comfortably accommodate one monopole , but is so small that the fluctuations are not likely to create isolated monopoles ( or , more accurately , well separated monopole ",
    "antimonopole pairs ) .",
    "this is the case when @xmath86 .",
    "that is , the entropy  action balance is dominated by the action cost , which limits us to the minimum number of monopoles ( and antimonopoles ) required to satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "we expect the free energy difference , eq .",
    "( [ equ : unprog ] ) , to be that between a system of one monopole and an uncharged box .",
    "because a monopole is a localised object , the regions far from the monopole core are unaware of the twist in the boundary conditions . @xmath57 only gets a contribution from the monopole core and is therefore independent of the volume . in this case",
    ", the identification of @xmath57 with the monopole mass makes sense , and a comparison between the measured values and the semiclassical formul  above yields information on the radiative corrections to the semiclassical monopole .",
    "as the volume is increased such that @xmath87 , the entropy gain in introducing well separated monopole ",
    "antimonopole pairs into the vacuum outweighs the action cost and the mean density of topological objects is no longer expected to be the minimum commensurate with the boundary conditions .",
    "the free energy required to introduce an extra monopole into the system is now less than the mass of the single monopole , as we demonstrate with a simple model .      following ref .",
    "@xcite , where a similar effect was discussed in the case of vortices in ( 2 + 1)dimensions , we assume that the density of monopoles is low enough , so that the probability of finding one in any sub - volume of space is independent of whether there are monopoles present elsewhere in the system . in other words ,",
    "the monopoles are assumed to be point - like or that overlap of the cores is of vanishing measure . as discussed above ,",
    "this dilute monopole gas approximation is believed to be valid deep in the broken phase .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath88 monopoles or antimonopoles ( we do not distinguish ) in a volume , @xmath61 , follows poissonian statistics @xmath89 we apply this to the volume of the whole lattice @xmath90 .",
    "we find different normalisation factors for twisted ( @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ) and untwisted ( @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ) boundary conditions .",
    "the free energy of the system ( or its derivative ) is extensive and the sum of the free energy of the components for a dilute gas , and considering the entire system we obtain : @xmath95 where @xmath96 was defined in eq .",

    "( [ equ : multi - deriv ] ) gives the desired plateau for intermediate @xmath61 , but then decays to zero as @xmath97 , beginning once @xmath98 , such that @xmath99 .",
    "note that since @xmath100 is simply the typical number of monopoles and antimonopoles created by fluctuations , this result shows that the monopole free energy decays as soon as the fluctuations can create isolated monopoles .",
    "crucial in the above calculation is the assumption that the monopoles are non - interacting .",
    "although the monopoles at least semiclassically have a long range coulomb interaction , we believe this approximation is justified , because the interaction is non - confining .",
    "nevertheless , it is only an approximation , and therefore it must be tested in numerical simulations , as we do in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we can also see that the above argument would break down if we tried to apply it to the four  dimensional case , where the monopoles are world lines rather than point - like objects . in a euclidean theory ,",
    "the action of the monopole world line would be proportional to its length , and therefore @xmath101 would vanish exponentially when the limit of infinite time dimension is taken .",
    "the same happens for vortices in the three ",
    "dimensional u(1 ) theory  @xcite . in",
    "future work we aim to verify that this is also true for vortices in a non  abelian theory . on the other hand ,",
    "if one of the three dimensions is compact as in the ( 2 + 1)dimensional case at a non - zero temperature , @xmath101 is finite , and again the vortex free energy vanishes in the infinite volume limit  @xcite .",
    "the prediction of the dilute monopole gas approximation that the monopole free energy vanishes in both phases in the infinite volume limit is compatible with the properties the phase diagram of the theory is believed to have .",
    "vanishing free energy means that the monopoles condense , and according to the dual superconductor picture  @xcite , this gives rise to confinement .",
    "indeed , it is known semiclassically that the non - zero monopole density gives the photon a non - zero mass even in the higgs phase  @xcite , and this leads to confinement .",
    "thus it is natural to assume that the higgs phase is analytically connected to the confining phase  @xcite .",
    "again , this can only be true if the monopole free energy vanishes in the higgs phase , because otherwise it would act as an order parameter signalling a transition from the higgs to the confining phase .",
    "previous studies @xcite have supported the idea of a smooth crossover between the phases , but as they only concentrated on local quantities , they can not be regarded as proofs . for instance , in the three  dimensional abelian higgs model , the phase transition can only be seen in practice by measuring non - local observables such as the vortex tension or the photon mass  @xcite . in the present case",
    ", the predicted non - zero photon mass has not been observed in simulations  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the results presented here that the reason for this lies in the very large volumes required .",
    "we simulate the georgi  glashow model on the lattice via monte carlo importance sampling of the partition functions for both the c  periodic and twisted c  periodic boundary conditions .",
    "updates to the lattice were performed as compound sweeps consisting of one heatbath update to the gauge and scalar fields , followed by two over - relaxation steps to each .",
    "measurements were made once per compound sweep .",
    "statistical errors were estimated by jack - knife analysis , dividing the data sets into ten bins . for most lattices , the bin size was much longer than the autocorrelation time of the observables , making them independent . this could be seen in an approximate decrease in the statistical errors as @xmath102 as the number of measurements , @xmath103 , was increased .",
    "the only lattice on which this was not readily apparent was the @xmath104 , @xmath105 , where the errors did not show such a reduction . this may indicate that , despite considerable computational effort , the ensemble size is still such that the autocorrelation time was comparable to the bin size .",

    "we can not therefore completely rule out from our data the possibility that @xmath57 remains finite even in the infinite volume limit .",
    "as was seen for small system sizes , the plateau values at least are heavily influenced by discretisation effects at @xmath137 . to perform",
    "a scaling study of the screening mechanism is beyond our current means .",
    "nonetheless , for a demonstration of the mechanism such effects are immaterial and do not affect the qualitative arguments .",
    "note also that no attempt has been made to estimate here the systematic errors in the monopole density . to do so would require a comparison of different screening hypotheses and fit functions , something that the data is , unfortunately , not accurate enough to address satisfactorily .",
    "in this paper , we have used a fully non - perturbative technique to measure the free energy of a t  hooft  polyakov monopole in the three ",
    "dimensional georgi  glashow model .",
    "this was achieved by simulating systems with two different boundary conditions , both of which are periodic up to symmetries of the lagrangian .",
    "this preserves the lattice translation invariance of the system and therefore makes sure there are no boundary effects .",
    "we found that in the higgs phase , the free energy reached a constant value at intermediate volumes , which shows that it is associated with a localised object .",
    "this is the quantum analogue of the t  hooft  polyakov monopole .",
    "we measure its mass by two different methods , and find it compatible with semiclassical expectations . `",
    "mean field ' application of the classical relations appears successful , and we can make estimates of the quantum corrected t hooft function .",
    "our best estimates are @xmath140 and @xmath141 from the derivative of the mass with respect to @xmath59 , and @xmath142 by the method of progressive twisting .",
    "these estimates are both self  consistent , and in agreement with the classical variation @xmath69 for small @xmath68 @xcite , indicating that radiative corrections are small .",
    "when the volume increased above a certain critical value , however , the free energy started to approach zero .",
    "this is consistent with an analytical calculation within the dilute monopole gas approximation , which predicts that the free energy vanishes in the infinite volume limit at any values of the couplings .    in the dual superconductor picture ,",
    "the vanishing monopole free energy implies confinement , and therefore our results are numerical evidence for polyakov s prediction that the higgs phase of this theory is confining .",
    "furthermore , if the monopole free energy vanishes everywhere , it can not be used as an order parameter , and therefore our results strongly support the conjecture that the confining and higgs phases are analytically connected to one another .",
    "neither , of course , can the monopole mass measured from the plateau in the free energy for intermediate system sizes act to distinguish the phases .",
    "it is non - zero in the deep higgs phase and zero in the deep symmetric phase .",
    "this plateau does not exist , however , everywhere in the phase diagram , notably near the transition line itself . the mean monopole separation there will be comparable to the core size and no plateau would be observed .",
    "thus the ` mass ' is ill  defined and can not serve as an order parameter .",
    "our findings suggest a straightforward generalisation to other cases . in a euclidean formulation in any number of dimensions ,",
    "any point - like topological defect that has finite action , will always have a non - zero density at any non - zero temperature .",
    "this means that these objects always have a zero free energy .",
    "an extended topological defect , such as a string or a domain wall , is , however , either a closed loop , surface etc .",
    ", in which case it does not contribute to the global properties of the systems , or it has an infinite action . in the latter case , the fluctuations can not generate them , and their free energy remains non - zero even in the infinite volume limit . because the free energy can be used as an order parameter",
    ", this suggests that models with extended topological defects always have a true phase transition rather than a smooth crossover .",
