    "recently , there has been considerable interest in inflationary models where the motion of the inflaton triggers the production of some non - inflation ( iso - curvature ) particles _ during _ inflation @xcite .",
    "examples have been studied where this particle production occurs via parametric resonance @xcite , as a result of a phase transition @xcite , or otherwise . in some scenarios , backreaction effects from particle production",
    "can slow the motion of the inflaton on a steep potential @xcite , providing a new inflationary mechanism .",
    "moreover , inflationary particle production arises naturally in a number of realistic microscopic models from string theory @xcite and also supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the production of massive iso - curvature particles during inflation ( and their subsequent interactions with the slow roll condensate ) provides a qualitatively new mechanism for generating cosmological perturbations .",
    "this new mechanism leads to a variety of novel observable signatures , such as features @xcite and nongaussianities @xcite in the primordial fluctuations .",
    "in this paper we study in detail the observational constraints on such distortions of the primordial power spectrum for a variety of scenarios .",
    "one motivation for this study is to determine whether features generated by particle production during inflation can explain some of the anomalies in the observed primordial power spectrum , @xmath7 .",
    "a number of different studies have hinted at the possible presence of some localized features in the power spectrum @xcite , which are not compatible with the simplest power law @xmath8 model .",
    "although such glitches may simply be statistical anomalies , there is also the tantalizing possibility that they represent a signature of primordial physics beyond the simplest slow roll inflation scenario .",
    "forthcoming polarization data may play a crucial role in distinguishing between these possibilities @xcite .",
    "however , in the meantime , it is interesting to determine the extent to which such features may be explained by microscopically realistic inflation models .",
    "we consider a very simple model where the inflaton , @xmath0 , and iso - inflaton , @xmath1 , fields interact via the coupling @xmath9 we focus on this simple prototype model in order to illustrate the basic phenomenology of particle production during inflation , however , we expect our results to generalize in a straightforward way to more complicated scenarios .",
    "models of the type ( [ int ] ) have been considered as a probe of planck - scale effects @xcite and offer a novel example of the non - decoupling of high energy physics during inflation .",
    "the @xmath1 particles are _ extremely _ massive for almost the entire duration of inflation excepting a tiny interval , much less than an @xmath10-folding , about the point @xmath11 . however , the @xmath1 field can not be integrated out due to the non - adiabatic time dependence of the mode functions , see @xcite for further discussion . ]    at the moment when @xmath11 ( which we assume occurs during the observable range of @xmath10-foldings of inflation ) the @xmath1 particles become instantaneously massless and are produced by quantum effects .",
    "this burst of particle production drains energy from the condensate @xmath12 , temporarily slowing the motion of the inflaton background and violating slow roll . shortly after this moment",
    "the @xmath1 particles become extremely non - relativistic , so that their number density dilutes as @xmath13 , and eventually the inflaton settles back onto the slow roll attractor .",
    "several previous papers @xcite have studied the temporary slowing - down of the inflaton background using the mean - field equation @xmath14 where the vacuum average @xmath15 is computed following @xcite . using this approach one finds that the transient violation of slow roll leads to a `` ringing pattern '' ( damped oscillations ) in the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations leaving the horizon near the moment when @xmath11 @xcite . in @xcite observational constraints on particle production during inflation were discussed in the context of this mean field treatment .    however , in @xcite cosmological fluctuations in the model ( [ int ] ) were re - considered , going beyond the mean - field treatment of @xmath0 .",
    "it was pointed out that the massive @xmath1 particles can rescatter off the condensate to generate bremsstrahlung radiation of long - wavelength @xmath16 fluctuations via diagrams such as fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] . multiple rescattering processes lead to a rapid cascade of power into the infra - red ( ir ) - _ ir cascading_. the inflaton modes generated by ir cascading freeze once their wavelength crosses the horizon and lead to a bump - like feature in the cosmological perturbations that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bumpfit ] .",
    "this feature is complimentary to the usual ( nearly ) scale - invariant quantum vacuum fluctuations from inflation .",
    "the bump dominates over the ringing pattern discussed above by many orders of magnitude , independently of the value of @xmath5 .",
    "= 0.15    = 0.35    in light of the results of @xcite it is clear that the observational constraints on the model ( [ int ] ) need to be reconsidered . since previous studies have suggested marginal evidence for localized power excesses in the cmb using both parametric @xcite and non - parametric @xcite techniques , it is interesting to determine if a simple and well - motivated model such as ( [ int ] ) can explain these anomalies . to answer this question we provide a simple semi - analytic fitting function that accurately captures the shape of the feature generated by particle production and ir cascading during inflation",
    "next , we confront this modified power spectrum with a variety of observational data sets .",
    "we find no evidence for a detection , however , we note that observations are consistent with relatively large spectral distortions of the type predicted by the model ( [ int ] ) .",
    "if the feature is located on scales relevant for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments then its amplitude may be as large as @xmath3 of the usual scale - invariant fluctuations , corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "our results translate into a @xmath6-dependent bound on the coupling @xmath5 which is crucial in order to determine whether the nongaussian signal associated with particle production and ir cascading is detectable in future missions @xcite .",
    "we also consider the more complicated features which result from multiple bursts of particle production and ir cascading .",
    "such features are a prediction of a number of string theory inflation models , including brane / axion monodromy @xcite . for appropriate choice of the spacing between the features , we find that the constraint on @xmath5 in this scenario is even weaker than the single - bump case .",
    "although we focus on the interaction ( [ int ] ) , our findings may have some bearing also on models with phase transitions during inflation .",
    "a simple prototype model for the latter scenario is @xmath17 at the moment when @xmath18 massive iso - inflaton @xmath1 particles are produced copiously by tachyonic ( spinodal ) instability @xcite .",
    "these produced particles will subsequently interact with the condensate via rescattering diagrams similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] .",
    "hence , we expect the features produced by inflationary phase transitions to be qualitatively similar to the bumps considered in this paper .",
    "( this intuition is consistent with a second order computation of the cosmological perturbations in a closely related model @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of the observational consequences . )    in the literature it is sometimes argued that inflationary phase transitions can be studied using a toy model with a sharp step - like feature in the inflaton potential .",
    "this potential - step model predicts a ringing pattern in the power spectrum , very much analogous to the mean field treatment of resonant particle production during inflation , discussed above .",
    "this treatment does not take into account the violent growth of inhomogeneities of the fields that occurs during realistic phase transitions @xcite and , in particular , does not capture rescattering effects and ir cascading . in the case of resonant particle production , these nonlinear effects have a _ huge _ impact on the cosmological fluctuations @xcite .",
    "hence , it is far from clear if the potential - step model provides a good effective description of inflationary phase transitions .    of course ,",
    "inflation models with steps in @xmath19 ( or its derivatives ) may be considered on phenomenological grounds , irrespective of the motivation from inflationary phase transitions . in @xcite",
    "cosmological perturbations from models with step - like features and discontinuities in higher derivatives were considered , as were the microscopic motivations for such constructions .",
    "see @xcite for a study of the nongaussianities induced in a variety of single - field models with steps or oscillations in the inflaton potential .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : param ]",
    "we provide a simple parametrization of the features that are imprinted on the primordial power spectrum by one or more bursts of particle production during inflation . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe our method and discuss the observational data sets employed to derive constraints on this modified power spectrum . in section [ sec : cons ] we present observational constraints on various scenarios . in section [ sec : particle ] we present some microscopic realizations of our scenario and discuss the implications of our findings for popular string theory / susy inflation models with a special emphasis on brane monodromy . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] we conclude .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that particle production and ir cascading during inflation in the model ( [ int ] ) generates a bump - like contribution to the primordial power spectrum .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bumpfit ] , this feature can be fit with a very simple function @xmath20 .",
    "the bump - like contribution from ir cascading is complimentary to the usual ( nearly ) scale - invariant contribution to the primordial power spectrum @xmath21 coming from the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton .",
    "the total , observable , power spectrum in the model ( [ int ] ) is simply the superposition of these two contributions : @xmath22 .",
    "this simple formula can be motivated from analytical considerations @xcite and provides a good fit to lattice field theory simulations near the peak of the feature and also in the ir tail . ) which does not concern us since that region is not phenomenologically interesting . ]",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this discussion to allow for multiple bursts of particle production during inflation .",
    "suppose there are multiple points @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) along the inflationary trajectory where new degrees of freedom @xmath25 become massless : @xmath26 for each instant @xmath27 when @xmath23 there will be an associated burst of particle production and subsequent rescattering of the produced massive @xmath25 off the condensate @xmath12 .",
    "each of these events proceeds as described above and leads to a new bump - like contribution to the power spectrum .",
    "these features simply superpose owing to that fact that each field @xmath25 is statistically independent ( so that the cross terms involving @xmath28 with @xmath29 in the computation of the two - point function must vanish ) .",
    "thus , we arrive at the following parametrization of the primordial power spectrum in models with particle production during inflation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the amplitude of the usual nearly scale invariant vacuum fluctuations from inflation and @xmath32 is the pivot , which we choose to be @xmath33 following @xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath34 depend on the couplings @xmath35 and measure the size of the features from particle production .",
    "we have normalized these amplitudes so that the power in the @xmath36-th bump , measured at the peak of the feature , is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the location of each feature , @xmath37 , is related to the number of @xmath10-foldings @xmath38 from the end of inflation to the time when the @xmath36-th burst of particle production occurs : roughly @xmath39 where @xmath40 at the moment when @xmath23 . from a purely phenomenological perspective the locations @xmath37 are completely arbitrary .",
    "we compare ( [ param ] ) to lattice field theory simulations in order to determine the amplitude @xmath34 in terms of model parameters .",
    "we find @xmath41 assuming standard chaotic inflation @xmath42 we have tested this formula for @xmath43 , taking both @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we found agreement up to factors order unity in all cases .",
    "theoretical consistency of our calculation of the shape of the feature bounds the coupling as @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "hence , the power spectrum ( [ param ] ) can be obtained from sensible microphysics only when @xmath47 .",
    "this constraint still allows for a huge range of observational possibilities : near the upper bound the feature is considerably larger than the vacuum fluctuations while near the lower bound the feature is completely undetectable .",
    "note that for each bump in ( [ param ] ) the ir tail @xmath48 as @xmath49 is similar to the feature considered by hoi , cline & holder in @xcite , consistent with causality arguments about the generation of curvature perturbations by local physics .",
    "the primordial power spectrum for our model is parametrized as ( [ param ] ) .",
    "our aim is to derive observational constraints on the various model parameters @xmath31 , @xmath50 , @xmath37 and @xmath34 using cmb , galaxy power spectrum and weak lensing data . to this end",
    "we use the cosmomc package @xcite to run markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) calculations to determine the likelihood of the cosmological parameters , including our new parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we employ the following data sets .",

    "@xcite ( marginalizing the bias @xmath53 and the @xmath54 parameter ) .",
    "however with a large bump in the linear power spectrum , this naive treatment may be not sufficient to characterize the non - linear response to the feature on small scales .",
    "ideally , this should be obtained from n - body simulations , however , such a study is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "there are several other caveats on our results in the high-@xmath55 regime .",
    "first , we assume linear bias for the galaxies , which may not be entirely safe at sufficiently small scales .",
    "moreover , sharp features in the matter power spectrum can cause sharp features in the bias as a function of @xmath55 .    keeping in mind these caveats our constraints on small scales",

    "[ fig_2d_multiple ] , there is evidently a preferred value of the feature spacing , roughly @xmath59 , for which the constraints are weakest .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "for very high density @xmath60 the localized features from ir cascading smear together and the total power spectrum ( [ param ] ) is @xmath61 where the size of the constant deformation scales linearly with the density of features : @xmath62 .",

    ", this linear trend is very evident from fig .",
    "[ fig_2d_multiple ] in the small-@xmath64 regime .",
    "this linear behaviour must break down at some point since as the features become infinitely widely spaced the constraint on @xmath63 must go to zero .",

    "to get some intuition for the kinds of multi - bump distortions that are allowed by the data , we consider an example with @xmath67 , @xmath68 and fix the vanilla parameters to @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",

    "from the low energy perspective one expects interactions of the type ( [ int ] ) to be rather generic , hence particle production during inflation may be expected in a wide variety of models . in this section",
    "we consider some explicit examples in string theory and susy in order to show how such models may be obtained microscopically and also to provide the proof of concept that realistic models do exist where @xmath75 are in the observable range .",
    "string theory inflation models may be divided into two classes depending on the origin of the inflaton : closed string models and open string models . in the former case",
    "the inflaton is typically a geometrical modulus associated with the compactification manifold ( examples include racetrack inflation @xcite , khler modulus inflation @xcite and roulette inflation @xcite ) . in the latter case",
    "the inflaton is typically the position modulus of some mobile d - brane living in the compactification manifold ( examples include brane inflation @xcite such as the warped kklmmt model @xcite , d3/d7 inflation @xcite and dbi inflation @xcite )",

    "if the mobile brane collides with any spectator brane during inflation then some of the stretched string states between these branes will become massless at the moment when the branes are coincident @xcite , precisely mimicking the interaction ( [ int ] ) .",
    "thus , we expect particle production , ir cascading and the bump - like features described above to be a reasonably generic prediction of open string inflation .",

    "successful reheating in these constructions may require the inclusion of spectator branes which collide with the mobile d4-brane during inflation and hence we expect cmb features to be a fairly generic prediction .",
    "we have shown that brane / axion monodromy models predict a distribution of bump - like features which are evenly spaced in @xmath141 over the observable range of scales . in the case of axion monodromy",
    "this multiple - bump spectral distortion is complimentary to the oscillatory features discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have also estimated the magnitude of these bump - like features in terms of model parameters .",
    "one motivation for the present study was to determine the extent to which microscopically realistic models such as ( [ int ] ) can reproduce the localized `` glitches '' in the power spectrum that have been detected ( albeit with marginal significance ) by several previous studies .",
    "these anomalies can be classified as follows :    1 .",
    "_ localized power excesses _ : + in both @xcite and @xcite power spectra with localized spikes were studied and in both cases marginal evidence was found for a detection of such features . in @xcite",
    "a non - parametric reconstruction of the power spectrum was performed and the result is marginally consistent with a power law everywhere , however , several localized spikes are evident in the reconstruction . + localized excesses are naturally obtained in our model ( [ int ] ) .",
    "sadly , however , we did not find that our model fits the data significantly better than the simplest slow roll inflation scenario .",
    "this does not necessarily imply a disagreement with @xcite since we use a different shaped feature and different data sets .",
    "( indeed , when the authors of @xcite repeat their analysis using the wmap 5-year data they do not obtain a detection @xcite , consistent with our findings . )",
    "localized power deficits _ : + in @xcite the richardson - lucy deconvolution algorithm was used to perform a non - parametric reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum which displayed a prominent ir cut - off near the horizon . in @xcite a similar analysis was performed and the reconstructed power spectrum displays a localized dip in power near @xmath142 .",
    "+ localized deficits _ can _ be produced by our model ( [ multiple ] ) but only in a rather contrived way .",
    "hence , we have not focused on such features in section [ sec : cons ] .",
    "3 .   _ damped oscillations _ : + in @xcite power spectra with superimposed ringing patterns were studied .",
    "such features provide a marginally improved fit over the simplest power - law model .",
    "+ as we have discussed in the introduction , damped oscillatory `` ringing '' features are not predicted by inflationary particle production . nor",
    "is it clear if such features are predicted by models with phase transitions .",
    "( of course damped oscillations _ can _ be obtained from a toy model with a step in @xmath19 . however",
    ", it may be difficult to obtain such a potential from realistic micro - physics ; generically one expects that any sharp features in @xmath19 will be smoothed out by quantum corrections . )    finally , let us note that features of the type studied here will lead to other observables beyond the distortion of the primordial power spectrum . in particular , bumps in @xmath7 will lead to features in the tensor spectrum ( resulting from the sourcing of gravitational waves by scalar fluctuations at second order in perturbation theory ) and also , possibly , black hole production . in @xcite",
    "these effects were estimated assuming a power spectrum which is qualitatively similar to ours . as discussed in @xcite , inflationary particle production",
    "will also lead to potentially large localized nongaussian features in the bispectrum ( and higher order statistics ) of the cosmological fluctuations .",
    "these nongaussianities will be discussed in detail in an upcoming work @xcite .",
