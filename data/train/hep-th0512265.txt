    "double sine - gordon theory has attracted interest recently chiefly because it is a prototype of non - integrable field theory which can be understood by application of techniques developed in the context of integrable field theories @xcite .",
    "it has several interesting applications such as to the study of massive schwinger model ( two - dimensional quantum electrodynamics ) and a generalized ashkin - teller model ( a quantum spin system ) which are discussed in @xcite .",
    "another application to the one - dimensional hubbard model is examined in @xcite ( together with the generalized ashkin - teller model mentioned above ) .",
    "a further potentially interesting application of the two-(and multi-)frequency sine - gordon model is for ultra - short optical pulses propagating in resonant degenerate medium @xcite .    in an earlier work the authors ( and coworkers ) studied this model using non - perturbative finite size techniques and established the phase diagram of the model @xcite ( which was recently extended to the multi - frequency generalization @xcite ) .",
    "in particular we used form factor perturbation theory introduced by delfino and mussardo in @xcite to predict mass spectra and verify them using the truncated conformal space approach ( tcsa ) @xcite .",
    "recently mussardo et al .",
    "@xcite applied a semiclassical soliton form factor technique developed by goldstone and jackiw @xcite to study the mass spectrum of the theory .",
    "they obtained results that contradict explicitely some of the results obtained using form factor perturbation theory in @xcite . in principle , the truncated conformal space approach applied in @xcite could decide the question , but the accuracy achieved there is not sufficient for this purpose .",
    "the present work reports a systematic study of this issue using improved tcsa numerics which do have the required accuracy . besides the numerical comparisons we also address the theoretical arguments raised in @xcite to support their case .",
    "we find a convincing and consistent picture , both numerically and theoretically , which allows us to clarify the issue .",
    "we would like to stress that the problem at hand is much more than a simple numerical discrepancy : it is the validity of the form factor perturbation theory and that of semiclassical techniques that is at stake here , both of which are very promising tools for non - perturbative investigation of non - integrable quantum field theories .    we start with recalling some necessary facts about the double sine - gordon model to set the stage in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the mass spectrum obtained from form factor perturbation theory in @xcite on the one hand and from the semiclassical soliton form factor technique on the other @xcite .",
    "section 4 describes the numerical work and the results obtained , while section 5 is devoted to the underlying theoretical issues .",
    "we conclude briefly in section 6 .",
    "the classical model is defined by the lagrangian density@xmath0 for @xmath1 we recover standard sine - gordon theory , where the spectrum is known to consist of a soliton doublet of mass @xmath2 and a continuum of breathers@xmath3 we define the quantum version of the model using perturbed conformal field theory as in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of a @xmath6 free boson cft .",
    "the quantum spectrum for @xmath7 consists of a soliton doublet of mass @xmath8 which is related to the coupling @xmath9 by @xcite@xmath10 which satisfies the semiclassical asymptotics@xmath11 which means that @xmath9 can be identified with @xmath12 in that limit ( similar results hold for @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) . in the quantum theory ,",
    "the breather spectrum is discrete and their numbers depend on the frequency @xmath15 : @xmath16 - 1\\label{eq : br_masses}\\ ] ]    double sine - gordon model can be considered as a non - integrable perturbation of the integrable sine - gordon field theory @xcite . because of the presence of the second cosine term , the field must be taken to have the periodicity @xmath17 which is called a @xmath18-folded model following @xcite .",
    "therefore at @xmath7 the theory has two degenerate vacua corresponding to the classical solutions @xmath19 as a result , each breather comes in two copies , and soliton states must be labeled with the vacua between which they mediate , thereby implementing a so - called kink structure @xcite . in this paper",
    "we treat @xmath13 as the non - integrable perturbing coupling constant , although it is equally possible to swap the roles of the cosine terms in this respect .",
    "the most interesting case is @xmath20 when for small @xmath13 the two vacua remain degenerate until a critical value is reached where the theory undergoes a phase transition .",
    "this was shown at the classical level ( mean field theory ) by @xcite to be of second order in the ising universality class , and it was established that this holds even after taking quantum fluctuations into account ( non - perturbatively ) in @xcite .",
    "this is the model in which we are the most interested , although we shall also use the @xmath21 case as a testing ground for our numerical calculations .",
    "form factor perturbation theory ( ffpt ) was introduced in @xcite to provide a way of expanding physical quantities in the non - integrable perturbing coupling .",
    "it was applied to the double sine - gordon model in @xcite . for our present purposes ,",
    "we only need the mass shift of the first breather , which reads    @xmath22    where @xmath23 labels the two copies of the first breather , @xmath24 , @xmath25^{\\frac{a^{2}}{4\\pi}}\\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\exp\\left\\ { \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{dt}{t}\\left[\\frac{\\sinh^{2}\\left(\\frac{a\\beta}{4\\pi}t\\right)}{2\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{8\\pi}t\\right)\\sinh\\left(t\\right)\\cosh\\left(\\left(1-\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{8\\pi}\\right)t\\right)}-\\frac{a^{2}}{4\\pi}e^{-2t}\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{lz_vev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath26 it is an important prediction of ffpt that the mass corrections vanish when @xmath20 and that also @xmath27 in general .      in @xcite a semiclassical method , based on the goldstone - jackiw semiclassical kink form factor @xcite ,",
    "was used to determine the spectrum of double sine - gordon theory . here",
    "we give a brief summary of their results for the case @xmath20 .",
    "they claim that the perturbation by @xmath28 induces a linear mass correction to the mass of the @xmath29th breather , and obtain the following result:@xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 index the splitting up of the @xmath29th breather level into what they call a short and a long breather .",
    "the main problem and the central issue in this paper , is that this disagrees with the ffpt results in the previous subsection that give a vanishing linear correction to the breather masses , and it also disagrees with the numerical studies in @xcite where the masses of the two copies of any breather levels remained degenerate as long as @xmath13 was lower than the critical value , where a second order phase transition induced a mass gap between the ground states and also lifted the degeneracy of the breather masses .",
    "however , the numerical studies in @xcite were not aimed at studying the breather levels and the data produced for that work , while still accessible , have insufficient precision to decide whether a splitting of the order of ( [ eq : mussardo_d2_orig ] ) is actually present .",
    "in addition , the authors of @xcite presented some arguments to support the result ( [ eq : mussardo_d2_orig ] ) , to which we shall return later . for the moment",
    "the issue is to decide which of the predictions is borne out by the dynamics of the model .    using the soliton mass @xmath33 , the mass correction can be written as@xmath34 in terms of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath35 this can be written@xmath36 where we again absorbed the difference between the classical and quantum mass / coupling relations into the higher order correction term .    the dimensionless coupling of the quantum theory is defined by@xmath37 ( where the difference in the exponent of @xmath8 is just the anomalous dimension of the perturbing operator ) . in the semiclassical limit",
    "@xmath38 only differs from @xmath39 by terms higher order in @xmath40 as discussed in the previous section , and similarly for @xmath8 and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore we can still use formula ( [ eq : mussardo_leading ] ) to leading order in @xmath15 in the quantum theory just replacing @xmath41 by @xmath8 and @xmath39 by @xmath38@xmath42 for our purposes we are only interested in the first breather ( @xmath43 ) and the comparisons to numerical results will be done at the following couplings:@xmath44",
    "we now aim to get the mass spectrum solving the model directly using the so - called truncated conformal space approach ( tcsa ) introduced by yurov and zamolodchikov in @xcite .",
    "it was extended to perturbations of @xmath6 free boson models in @xcite and applied to the double sine - gordon model in @xcite .",
    "the application of tcsa to perturbations of @xmath6 free boson cft is described in detail in @xcite and references therein , therefore we do not go into the details here .",
    "we mention only that this method gives the finite volume spectrum of the theory , from which the masses can be extracted by locating the so - called scaling region in which the mass gap function ( the energy difference between the one - particle state and the corresponding vacuum state ) is approximately constant .",
    "more precisely , we locate the volume range where the magnitude of the numerical derivative of the mass gap function is smallest and define the mass as the value the mass gap function takes there . the hilbert space can be split up into sectors differing in the value of the winding number of the field @xmath45 and the eigenvalue of total spatial momentum , and the mass gap functions we are interested in can be measured from the sector with no winding and zero momentum .",
    "we improved on the precision of the tcsa significantly with respect to @xcite .",
    "first , we chose smaller values for @xmath15 which makes tcsa converge faster in the models at hand .",
    "this is also advantageous since it means we are closer to the classical limit and so we expect to be able to test the semiclassical prediction ( [ eq : mussardo_d2_orig ] ) .",
    "second , we pushed the cutoff much higher using more machine power , and also by applying the parity symmetries to project the hilbert space into even and odd subspaces , using that the tcsa hamiltonian is block diagonal in the appropriate basis .",
    "this made possible treating more than @xmath46 states in reasonable computing time , and allowed us to achieve the accuracy which makes it possible to judge the correctness of the semiclassical prediction ( [ eq : mussardo_d2_orig ] ) .      in this case",
    "the model has a symmetry @xmath47 which can be used to project the tcsa hilbert space onto an even and an odd sector .",
    "this reduces the number of states and helps to achieve higher values of the cutoff . in order to be on safe ground ,",
    "the program was run both with and without a projection for several values of @xmath15 , @xmath38 and the cutoff .",
    "the resulting spectra were always identical ( within the precision of floating point arithmetics ) , independently of the values of the parameters and of the cutoff , which confirms that the symmetry projection was correctly implemented .",
    "we also compared the @xmath48 to predictions of exact @xmath32 matrix theory , which they matched perfectly within the truncation errors .",
    "the vacua can be found in the even , while the one - particle states in the odd sector .",
    "they can be matched against each other using the fact that the bulk energy constant of the two vacua are different , therefore the two vacua ( and also the two corresponding one - particle states ) have a different slope in the scaling region .",
    "the redefinition @xmath49 leaves the total spectrum invariant ( in both the odd and the even sector separately ) , but exchanges the role of the two sets of states , therefore it is expected that@xmath50 we choose the following value for the coupling @xmath51 for mass determination , the cutoff was placed at level @xmath52 resulting in @xmath53 states in the even and @xmath54 states in the odd sector respectively .    at this value of @xmath15 there are@xmath55 - 1=10\\ ] ] breathers in the @xmath7 spectrum which shows that this model is deeply in the semiclassical regime .",
    "the ffpt formula ( [ eq : ffpt_b1 ] ) gives the following prediction for the mass corrections:@xmath56 we summarize the measured values of the masses in table [ cap : mass_2.5_0 ] and plotted them against predictions of form factor perturbation theory in figure [ cap : tcsa_ffpt ] .",
    "it is obvious that the measured masses follow well the predictions from form factor perturbation theory , but there are deviations that grow with the coupling .",
    "these are expected to be higher order effects . however , second order corrections should cancel from the difference , since sending @xmath13 to @xmath57 exchanges the identity of the two particles @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mass differences agree with form factor perturbation theory within the estimated tcsa errors which can be estimated from cut - off dependence of the energy levels and the flatness of the gap function in the scaling region .",
    "we can also fit the coefficient of ( [ eq : d0_ffpt_prediction ] ) against the mass splitting measured in tcsa , for which we find@xmath58 the central value differs by only @xmath59 from ( [ eq : d0_ffpt_prediction ] ) , consistent with the @xmath60 error range of the fit .",
    ".[cap : mass_2.5_0 ] comparing masses measured from tcsa and predicted using ffpt for @xmath61 .",
    "all data are in units of the unperturbed soliton mass @xmath8 .",
    "tcsa mass measurements have an estimated error of order @xmath62 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the mass splitting measured from tcsa compared to the semiclassical prediction ( [ eq : mussardo_prediction ] ) at @xmath63 .",
    "the error bars indicate the estimated magnitude of truncation errors . ]",
    "we can again perform a fit in the range @xmath64 $ ] with the results @xmath65 the prediction ( [ eq : mussardo_prediction ] ) gives @xmath66 which is again ruled out by two orders of magnitude .",
    "in the previous section we demonstrated that tcsa data are strongly incompatible with the semiclassical analysis of the mass spectrum in @xcite , while they are in full accordance with the analysis of our earlier paper @xcite based on form factor perturbation theory .      considering that the prediction ( [ eq : mussardo_d2_orig ] ) is only semiclassical , one may hope that higher order corrections can adjust it to be compatible to the numerical data .",
    "this hope is unfounded , however , since we have seen that quantum corrections can be estimated to be at most a few percent at the values of @xmath15 we considered .",
    "therefore we must conclude that ( [ eq : mussardo_d2_orig ] ) is not correct even to its lowest order .",
    "this is not surprising in the light of the fact that the leading order term ( [ eq : mussardo_leading ] ) is of order @xmath67 .",
    "the semiclassical computation presented in @xcite is simply not valid to this order .",
    "quantum corrections to soliton form factor and soliton mass should be taken into account before extracting the breather mass from the pole of the form factor . to order @xmath40 , however , ( [ eq : mussardo_leading ] ) is in accord with form factor perturbation theory that predicts no linear correction to the masses .",
    "we would also like to discuss briefly the mass corrections predicted in @xcite for the case @xmath21 .",
    "they obtain@xmath68+o\\left(\\lambda_{0}^{2}\\right)\\ ] ] expanding in @xmath15 @xmath69 the classical limit @xmath70 is correctly reproduced by this formula . however , the @xmath67 term can not be trusted because of the same reasons as above .",
    "expansion of the ffpt mass correction ( [ eq : d0_ffpt_prediction ] ) produces terms of all orders in @xmath40 .",
    "it is obvious that a @xmath40 term is also generated from ( [ eq : mussardo_d0_expanded ] ) when we replace the classical parameters @xmath14 and @xmath41 by the pcft coupling @xmath13 and the quantum soliton mass @xmath8 since the coupling and the mass are redefined at each order in the @xmath40 expansion .",
    "for this reason alone the terms in ( [ eq : mussardo_d0_expanded ] ) that are higher order in @xmath15 can not be compared directly to ( [ eq : d0_ffpt_prediction ] ) .",
    "however , there is a deeper problem with ( [ eq : mussardo_d0_expanded ] ) : the presence of the nonanalytic ( logarithmic ) dependence in @xmath14 would suggest that although the masses have the correct limit when @xmath71 , the @xmath72 case can not be treated as a perturbation of the @xmath1 model .",
    "in contrast , both conformal perturbation theory and form factor perturbation theory shows a rather different behaviour .",
    "conformal perturbation theory produces a series expansion in @xmath13 and @xmath9 , which contains no ultraviolet divergences at any order if @xmath73 .",
    "there does not seem to be any way to produce nonanalytic behaviour in the coupling @xmath13 in the regime of small @xmath15 : even a partial resummation over @xmath9 would leave us with an analytic expansion in powers of @xmath13 despite the fact that it may produce nonanalytic terms in @xmath9 ( due to infrared divergences present in the perturbation around the conformal field theory describing the massless ultraviolet fixed point ) .",
    "this partial resummation , on the other hand , is just expected to be identical to form factor perturbation theory ( which is free of the infrared divergences since it expands around a massive field theory ) which gives a first order correction in @xmath13 with no @xmath74 terms , and matches very well with the numerics of tcsa as shown in subsection 3.1 . on the other hand , since the semiclassical soliton form factor calculation in @xcite is not self - consistent to order @xmath67 , it can not be used to argue for the presence of @xmath74 corrections . before attempting any comparison to tcsa results , one must compute all the relevant loop corrections and suitably renormalize @xmath75 to @xmath76 , which is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "we remark that even if all of the above is carried out , it could prove very difficult to provide any conclusive evidence against the existence of @xmath77 corrections of order @xmath67 , since these can not be separated easily from the already present @xmath13 corrections , which are of order @xmath78 .",
    "however , the agreement of the measured mass splitting ( illustrated in figure [ cap : tcsa_ffpt](b ) ) with the ffpt result ( [ eq : d0_ffpt_prediction ] ) is very suggestive : the linear coefficient can be determined to a relative accuracy of @xmath79 , and we still have not exhausted all resources to make the tcsa even more accurate : increasing the cut level is still a definite possibility ( although it increases the required computer time very fast , with around the @xmath80th power of the dimension of the hilbert space ) , and extrapolating the cutoff dependence of measured masses to infinite cutoff is another one .      in the paper",
    "@xcite the authors also produce a scenario in the @xmath20 case to support the presence of the linear mass correction term ( [ eq : mussardo_d2_orig ] ) .",
    "let us recall the main line of their argument .",
    "it is known that the breathers arise as bound states in the soliton - antisoliton ( @xmath81 ) channel , with alternating @xmath82-parity .",
    "namely , the @xmath29th breather @xmath83 with @xmath29 odd / even arises as a bound state in a channel where the @xmath81 wave - function is odd / even under charge conjugation ( interchanging soliton and antisoliton ) , respectively .",
    "the authors argue that such a situation is very unique to the sine - gordon model and holds only if the non - integrable coupling @xmath13 is not present .",
    "they claim that there exists another breather state of `` wrong '' @xmath82-parity and the @xmath29 breather is actually a doublet @xmath84 ( the upper index denoting @xmath82-parity ) , but the states of wrong parity @xmath85 decouple from the model which means that the corresponding three - particle couplings have the behaviour@xmath86 so that only one pole appears in the @xmath81 channel for any @xmath29 , with alternating @xmath82-parity , since the other residue vanishes , and therefore the @xmath87 @xmath81 scattering matrix degenerates to a one - dimensional projection at each pole .",
    "they continue by demonstrating that a modified form factor perturbation theory , adjusted to take into account this degeneracy produces a linear correction to the breather mass of equal magnitude and opposite sign to the two breather copies , thus making the picture appear consistent with their semiclassical result ( [ eq : mussardo_d2_orig ] ) . for @xmath88-folded models where the periodicity of the field is determined so that vacua are only identified after @xmath88 periods@xmath89 they predict @xmath90 copies of each breather , twice as much",
    "as the @xmath88-folded model has , half of which is claimed to decouple from the model .",
    "there are , however , several problems with this scenario .",
    "extensive investigation of the spectrum of sine - gordon theory has been carried out using the tcsa approach .",
    "no sign of these extra states was ever detected , although the hilbert space was guaranteed to be complete by taking all states of the ultraviolet conformal field theory into account ( truncated by an upper energy cut , but all the experience with tcsa shows that this can not be the reason for missing these states ) .",
    "varying @xmath15 down from the free fermion value @xmath91 one can observe directly how the breather states appear .",
    "the result can be stated very simply in the case of the 1-folded model .",
    "we can identify the @xmath81 states in the spectrum by fitting their finite size energy dependence using bethe ansatz and the exact @xmath32-matrix @xcite , and since the @xmath32-matrix eigenvalue in the odd / even parity channel is different , we can even identify the parity of the states .",
    "when @xmath15 crosses the threshold corresponding to the appearance of the @xmath29 breather , a single @xmath81 state crosses below the @xmath92 limit ( where @xmath8 is the soliton mass ) , and this is a state of @xmath82-parity @xmath93 : new breather states appear one by one , and always with the right parity .",
    "there is no trace of the extra states , and this carries over to the @xmath88-folded case as well : at each threshold value of @xmath15 we always observe @xmath88 copies of the appropriate breathers appearing in the spectrum ( cf .",
    "@xcite for some examples of spectra ; we have produced many of them for different values of @xmath15 , of which the published paper naturally contains only a few representative examples . )    in the above argument , there is one possible loophole : tcsa uses periodic boundary conditions , and it may be argued that these exclude some states from the spectrum or produce some identification between states , leaving only half of the breather states that are actually there in infinite volume discussed in the main text . ] . however , even in this case one expects the mass spectrum extracted from tcsa to display the correct dependence on the couplings , and so the fact that our numerical results present such a strong case against any linear term ( or , in fact , any odd power ) in @xmath13 remains a very compelling evidence against this scenario .",
    "the paper @xcite also brings up an analogy with the theory @xmath94 ( the factorized scattering theory of the tricritical ising model ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath32-matrix has no bound state poles , but such poles can be introduced by dressing with appropriate cdd factors .",
    "@xmath94 has three vacua which can be illustrated by the potential        the middle well of these is flanked by two others , and a simple calculation of the bootstrap spectrum reveals two breather bound states over it .",
    "these can be described as bound states of a kink going from the middle vacuum to one side and of a kink coming the way back .",
    "this seems to be analogous to the sine - gordon vacuum structure , which is periodically infinite , but any chosen vacuum has again two neighbours .    the analogy is flawed , however , because in sine - gordon theory due to the periodic vacuum structure the boson is actually compactified on a circle . in the standard ( 1-folded )",
    "case , the identification is @xmath95 and therefore all vacua are identified . it does not make much sense to talk about two vacua flanking a middle one as in the @xmath94 case where all three vacua are physically distinct and show up as @xmath96 different energy levels in a finite volume ( e.g. tcsa ) spectrum , which become exponentially degenerate in the large volume limit .",
    "the @xmath97-folded sine - gordon model , on the other hand , has a unique ground state even in the large volume limit . in the @xmath88-folded model",
    "there are @xmath88 different vacua ( with the topology of a circle ) , which is also manifest in the finite volume spectrum @xcite .",
    "this vacuum structure is corroborated both by tcsa studies and by the exact description of the finite volume spectrum using the destri - de vega nonlinear integral equation ( nlie ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it accounts readily for the @xmath88 copies of each breather , but there is no additional doubling in the spectrum : the physics of these vacua is rather different from that of the @xmath94 case .",
    "our final conclusion is that the arguments given by the authors of @xcite for these additional states are not well - founded , while the numerical data show that the dynamics of the model can be described very well by the usual form factor perturbation theory applied in @xcite without any need for adjustments .",
    "the numerical analysis has shown with quite large precision that the conclusions of @xcite regarding the mass spectrum are untenable , more precisely the linear mass corrections at @xmath20 predicted by them are ruled out by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the main issue seems to be that they trust the results from the semiclassical form factor approach to an order at which it is simply not consistent without performing the appropriate loop corrections as well .",
    "we also considered their theoretical arguments and have shown that they do not stand up to closer scrutiny .",
    "in contrast , the numerics is fully consistent with our original conclusions about the mass spectrum in @xcite .",
    "obviously , this must not be taken as a complete verification of these results .",
    "it is always possible that there are effects that the numerics misses because of its finite precision and otherwise limited scope but which may be relevant for theoretical understanding . for the present",
    "we can only say that under closer examination the picture presented in @xcite holds up .",
    "that picture is also consistent with many theoretical expectations and accumulated experience from the long study of two - dimensional quantum field theory ( the folklore ) , but certainly this is not a water - tight proof either .",
