    "<S> [ gamma ] tells us that our qualitative conclusions in the previous paragraph are true for the entire range of possible values of @xmath88 shown . </S>",

    "<S> [ gamma ] allows us to suggest ameliorating the coherence times by e.g. increasing the thickness of the layer so as to move defects further away , and by passivation of the most deleterious defects : interface , border and mobile point defects .    </S>",
    "<S> sample dephasing rates for uniform defect densities have been calculated in the table [ defecttable ] using typical defect parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> all defects have been assigned a switching time @xmath119 @xmath70s . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we do not consider a distribution of switching times @xmath61 , but rather focus on an incoherent array of fluctuators , each giving rise to a random walk in time , all with the _ same _ @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to average @xmath0 , rather than @xmath120 , over defect locations . </S>",
    "<S> the table [ defecttable ] upholds our findings that charge defects are much more efficient in causing dephasing than spin defects .    </S>",
    "<S> conventional wisdom holds that , since magnetic defects couple to the spin degree of freedom , their effect on dephasing of spin qubits should be stronger . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of both individual defects and uniform defect densities shows this to be incorrect . </S>",
    "<S> charge defects , including interface , border and mobile point defects , are most deleterious for singlet - triplet qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of charge defects on dephasing can be reduced by going into the far - detuned regime , since the dephasing rate is @xmath121 . at the same time , the exchange coupling @xmath122 , thus in the far detuned regime the effect of charge noise is weaker , but with the cost that the exchange gate is correspondingly slower .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a picture of the potential landscape seen by singlet - triplet qubits in si and conclude that charge defects are much more effective in inducing dephasing than spin defects . in the process of analyzing a specific architecture and material system , we laid out a general framework enabling this analysis to be extended to different types of devices , so that the most deleterious defects can be identified in other types of charge and spin qubits .    </S>",
