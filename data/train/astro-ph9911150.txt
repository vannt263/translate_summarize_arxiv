    "since the launch of the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) , ground - based @xmath0-ray telescopes have come to play an important role in our understanding of the @xmath0-ray sky . in many cases , it has required the results from both the ground and space to properly interpret the observations of a particular source . in this context ,",
    "i review the status of ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy and consider the implications of these observations .",
    "i will concentrate on the results obtained with imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes because they have produced most of the scientific results to date and because several papers in this proceedings address other ground - based telescope results .",
    "the interested reader is encouraged to seek out more complete reviews that have recently been published @xcite for more information . to save space",
    ", i will not cite the original detection references for those objects that are included in the review articles .",
    "seven sources of very high energy ( vhe , @xmath1gev ) @xmath0-ray emission associated with galactic objects have been detected at this time : three plerionic supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( crab nebula , psr1706 - 44 , and vela ) , three shell - type snrs ( sn1006 , rxj1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , and cassiopeiaa @xcite ) , and the x - ray binary centaurusx-3 @xcite . a summary of the vhe properties of these objects is given in table[gal_srcs ] .",
    "the crab nebula and psr1706 - 44 have been confirmed as sources of vhe @xmath0-rays by detections from independent groups . the crab nebula has the highest vhe @xmath0-ray flux of these objects and this , along with its steady flux , has established it as the standard candle of ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy . because of this and because ground - based @xmath0-ray telescopes have a range of energy thresholds , i list source fluxes in units of the crab flux to make comparisons of source strength easier .",
    ".galactic sources of vhe @xmath0-rays . [ cols=\">,^,^,^ \" , ]     the most distinctive feature of the vhe emission from mrk421 and mrk501 is large amplitude , rapid variability . for mrk421 , the average flux does not change much from year to year",
    "instead , flares develop and decay on day - scales or less and drop to a baseline emission level ( if one exists at all ) that is below the sensitivity of current telescopes @xcite .",
    "fluxes from 0.1 to 10 times the crab flux have been detected and flares lasting as little as 30 minutes have been measured @xcite . for mrk501 , the flaring appears to be somewhat slower and of lower amplitude than that seen in mrk421 @xcite .",
    "the most prominent features of the variability in mrk501 are large changes in its average flux and flaring activity , as shown in figure  [ m5var ] .",
    "the yearly average flux has varied from 0.08crab in 1995 to 1.4crab in 1997 and the amount of day - scale flaring increases with increasing flux @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important development in the tev results on mrk421 and mrk501 since the 4th compton symposium has been accurate measurements of their spectra .",
    "observations of several high ( 1  10crab ) flux states between 1995 and 1996 from mrk421 by the whipple collaboration show that the spectra are all consistent with a simple power law with photon index @xmath2 over the energy range from 0.25  10tev @xcite .",
    "observations by the hegra collaboration of mrk421 in a lower ( @xmath31crab ) flux state in 1998 also indicate a power law spectrum , but the spectral index is @xmath4 over the energy range 0.5 ",
    "7tev @xcite .",
    "this difference could reflect a change in spectral index with flux , but neither whipple nor hegra see evidence of spectral variability within their respective data sets .",
    "further study may help resolve these differences .    unlike mrk421 , the spectrum of mrk501 during its high state in 1997 is not consistent with a simple power law .",
    "the whipple @xcite and hegra @xcite collaborations derive spectra of the form : @xmath5 the form of the curvature term in these two expressions reflects the preferences of the authors , since the data from both groups are indistinguishable when overlaid .",
    "the average spectrum for mrk501 measured by the cat group is consistent with that observed by hegra and whipple @xcite , but the cat data show evidence of spectral hardening during high flux states while the whipple and hegra data do not .",
    "again , further study may resolve these issues .",
    "mrk421 and mrk501 have been the target of several intensive multi - wavelength campaigns .",
    "observations of mrk421 in 1995 @xcite and mrk501 in 1997 @xcite revealed day - scale correlations between the tev @xmath0-ray and x - ray emissions , suggesting that both sets of photons derive from the same population of particles .",
    "the variability of the synchrotron emission increases with increasing energy , and egret s lack of detected variability in these studies suggests similar behavior for the high energy emission .",
    "thus , these flares seem to be caused primarily by impulsive increases in the efficiency for acceleration of the highest energy electrons .",
    "this is not to say that the multi - wavelength behavior of mrk421 and mrk501 is identical .",
    "for example , in mrk421 , the variability amplitude of the tev @xmath0-rays and x - rays is comparable while for mrk501 , the variability amplitude is larger in the tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "more spectacular , is the difference in the spectral energy distributions of these two objects , as shown in figure  [ m4_m5_sed ] .",
    "the spectrum of mrk421 is typical of high - frequency peaked bl lacs : a synchrotron peak at @xmath61kev followed by a rapid drop - off .",
    "mrk501 , on the other hand , appears to be an extreme version of a high - frequency peaked bl lac , as its synchrotron spectrum peaked at 100kev in 1997 , the highest ever observed in a blazar .",
    "also , the power output at x - ray and tev energies in mrk421 is approximately equal but for mrk501 , the tev power can be much less than in x - rays .",
    "those observations do not resolve any of the hour - scale flares known to occur in mrk421 and mrk501 . in 1998 ,",
    "a campaign involving the whipple telescope and _ bepposax _ had overlapping observations of an hour - scale flare from mrk421 as shown in figure  [ m4_1998 ] @xcite .",
    "the different energy bands exhibit a similar rise time , but the tev @xmath0-ray flux appears to fall - off much faster than the x - rays .",
    "thus , at the same time that the first hour - scale correlations are seen in a tev blazar , there is also evidence that the tev @xmath0-rays and x - rays in mrk421 may not be completely correlated on all time - scales .",
    "from the previous paragraphs , it should be clear that ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy has become a vibrant branch of astrophysics .",
    "there are established sources with well - measured spectra and , in the case of the bl lacs , variability light - curves .",
    "there are several unconfirmed sources which lead me to believe that more sources are to be found in this waveband . and , there are some controversies which need resolving ( e.g. , do the spectra in mrk421 and mrk501 vary or not ? ) - which i interpret as a healthy sign of a growing field",
    "however , it is also clear that many questions remain unanswered .",
    "for example , none of the sources show conclusive evidence of cosmic - ray acceleration . also , we do not know the particle content in blazar jets , nor do we know where the emission spectra of most of the egret - detected blazars cut - off .",
    "ground - based efforts , such as veritas @xcite , will dramatically improve the measurements in the vhe band .",
    "combined with the next generation of space - based @xmath0-ray telescopes ( e.g. , glast ) and x - ray telescopes like chandra and astro - e , many of these questions will hopefully be answered ."
