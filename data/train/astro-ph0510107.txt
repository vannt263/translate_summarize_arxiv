    "for gravitational collapse in the universe , zeldovich ( 1970 ) proposed an approximation , the zeldovich approximation ( za ) .",
    "the za is a lagrangian approximation based on the motion of a fluid element .",
    "if its initial position is @xmath0 in comoving coordinates , the eulerian position @xmath1 at time @xmath2 is @xmath3 the displacement @xmath4 satisfies the lagrangian equation of motion ( peacock 1999 ,  15.2 ) : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the hubble parameter . the gravitational potential @xmath7 is obtained from the density contrast @xmath8 and the density parameter @xmath9 via the poisson equation @xmath10 from the first - order perturbation to equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , zeldovich ( 1970 ; see also shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ; sahni & coles 1995 ) assumed that the displacement @xmath11 scales with the linear growth factor @xmath12 : @xmath13 here the subscript `` in '' indicates a value at the initial time @xmath14 .",
    "the linear growth factor @xmath15 satisfies the evolution equation @xmath16 hence , the displacement @xmath11 is assumed to satisfy the following equation : @xmath17 equation ( [ eq4 ] ) or ( [ eq6 ] ) provides an approximation for the gravitational collapse , until the shell crossing where fluid elements from different initial positions reach the same position in eulerian coordinates .",
    "the approximation applies to any cosmological model .",
    "the za is used for various topics in observational cosmology , e.g. , the construction of the initial conditions in an @xmath18-body simulation ( doroshkevich et al . 1980 ; bertschinger 1998 ) , the estimation of the initial conditions of the universe from observations of galaxies in the present universe ( dekel 1994 ) , and the analytical study of the pairwise peculiar velocities of galaxies ( yoshisato et al .",
    "the za is also used to develop the adhesion approximation ( gurbatov et al .",
    "1989 ) , the truncated za ( coles et al . 1993 ) , and the post- , post - post- , and pad - zas ( bernardeau 1994 ; buchert 1994 ; munshi et al . 1994",
    "; bouchet et al . 1995 ; catelan 1995 ; matsubara et al .",
    "thus , the za plays an important role .    despite its simplicity",
    ", the za is accurate even in the quasi - nonlinear regime , provided that the shell crossing is unimportant as at early times or at large scales .",
    "this accuracy has been demonstrated in statistical comparison with an @xmath18-body simulation ( coles et al .",
    "1993 ; kofman et al .",
    "1994 ) and with a high - order eulerian perturbation theory ( bernardeau et al . 1994 ; munshi & starobinsky 1994 ) .",
    "why is the za so accurate ?",
    "the usual explanation invokes the fact that the lagrangian description is intrinsically nonlinear in the density field ( catelan 1995 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "the density contrast @xmath19 is obtained from the displacement @xmath11 . even if the displacement is small and",
    "lies in the linear regime , the corresponding density contrast could be large and lie in the nonlinear regime .",
    "however , the za s accuracy depends on the shape of the overdense region .",
    "we believe that this dependence is the most essential ( yoshisato et al .",
    "1998 ; peacock 1999 ,  15.8 ) .",
    "the past comparison of the za with an exact solution was made only for a spherical collapse ( munshi et al . 1994 ; sahni & shandarin 1996 ) .",
    "yoshisato et al .",
    "( 1998 ) made the comparison for spheroidal collapses , which are more usual situations in the real universe .",
    "it was found that , for a given value of the density contrast , the za is more accurate in a lower dimensional collapse .",
    "zeldovich ( 1970 ) noticed that , in the za equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , the acceleration term @xmath20 in the true equation of motion ( [ eq2 ] ) has been replaced with the linear term for the displacement @xmath21 .",
    "this gravitational acceleration of the za is identical to the true gravitational acceleration in a one - dimensional collapse ( buchert 1989 ) , for which the za is exact ( doroshkevich et al .",
    "1973 ) .    here",
    "we analytically show that the za s gravitational acceleration approaches the true gravitational acceleration in the order of three- , two- , then one - dimensional collapses (  [ s2 ] ) . we also numerically show that any spheroidal collapse becomes progressively lower dimensional with the passage of time .",
    "the za s gravitational acceleration remains close to the true gravitational acceleration (  [ s3 ] ) .",
    "then we discuss why the za is accurate (  [ s4 ] ) .",
    "the lagrangian equations of motion ( [ eq2 ] ) are derived for one - dimensional planar , two - dimensional cylindrical , and three - dimensional spherical collapses .",
    "we compare these equations with the za equation ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "when the collapse is planar , the gravitational potential @xmath22 is obtained using green s function @xmath23 for the one - dimensional poisson equation ( [ eq3 ] ) : @xmath24 the gravitational acceleration of the fluid element at position @xmath25 is @xmath26.\\ ] ] this gravitational acceleration is proportional to the difference of the integrated density contrast between both sides of the position @xmath25 .",
    "the reason is that , in a one - dimensional collapse , the gravity is independent of the distance .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ eq8 ] ) with the displacement of the fluid element @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the initial position . until the shell crossing",
    ", mass conservation leads to @xmath29 here we set the initial density contrast to zero .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ eq9 ] ) that the integrated density contrast is proportional to the displacement @xmath30 : @xmath31 the gravitational acceleration is @xmath32 thus , in the one - dimensional planar collapse , the true gravitational acceleration is identical to the za s gravitational acceleration .",
    "when the collapse is cylindrical , we use green s function @xmath33 for the two - dimensional poisson equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the gravitational acceleration of the fluid element at position @xmath34 is @xmath35 this acceleration is proportional to @xmath36 times the density contrast integrated over the radius @xmath37 , in accordance with gauss s theorem ( binney & tremaine 1987 ,  2.0 ) .",
    "the gravity in a two - dimensional collapse is proportional to the inverse of the distance .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ eq12 ] ) with the initial position of the fluid element @xmath0 .",
    "until the shell crossing , mass conservation leads to @xmath38 r'dr ' = \\int^{\\vert \\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$ } \\vert}_0 r ' dr ' .\\ ] ] then , as in  [ s21 ] ,",
    "the gravitational acceleration is @xmath39 since the displacement @xmath30 is @xmath40 , this true gravitational acceleration differs from the za s gravitational acceleration @xmath41 by a factor @xmath42 .",

    "[ s21 ] and [ s22 ] , the gravitational acceleration is @xmath47 since the displacement @xmath30 is @xmath40 , this true gravitational acceleration differs from the za s gravitational acceleration @xmath41 by a factor @xmath48 .      summarizing the equations of motion for one - dimensional planar , two - dimensional cylindrical , and three - dimensional spherical collapses ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq11 ] ] , [ [ eq14 ] ] , and [ [ eq17 ] ] ) , we have @xmath49 with the displacement @xmath50 and the dimension @xmath51 , 2 , or 3 .",
    "the factor @xmath52 reflects the dependence of the gravity on the distance @xmath37 .",
    "the factor @xmath53 reflects the change of the integrated density contrast in the course of the gravitational collapse .",
    "we compare equation ( [ eq18 ] ) with the za equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , in order to study the za s accuracy .",
    "when the displacement is small , these two equations are almost identical .",
    "the za is accurate .",
    "even when the displacement is large , in a lower dimensional collapse , the gravity @xmath52 is more independent of the distance @xmath37 , and the change of the integrated density contrast @xmath53 is closer to the displacement @xmath54 .",
    "the za becomes progressively more accurate in the order of three- , two- , and one - dimensional collapses .",
    "for the one - dimensional collapse , the za equation ( [ eq6 ] ) is exact .",
    "these results are independent of the functional forms of @xmath6 and @xmath9 and thus apply to any cosmological model .",
    "during a real gravitational collapse , the overdense region changes its shape .",
    "the effect of this change on the za s accuracy , especially in the gravitational acceleration , is studied by using the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous spheroid as an idealized model ( see also yoshisato et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "when pressure is negligible , the gravitational collapse increases the ellipticity of the spheroid ( lin et al .",
    "1965 ) . while an initially oblate spheroid forms a plane - like structure , an initially prolate spheroid forms a line - like structure .",
    "this is because the gradient of the gravitational potential generated by the spheroid is larger along the minor axis of the spheroid than along the major axis .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is stronger and the gravitational collapse is more significant along the minor axis ( binney 1977 ) . since the collapse becomes progressively lower dimensional with the passage of time , the za",
    "is expected to remain accurate .",
    "the density contrast in the presence of a homogeneous ellipsoid is determined by the half - lengths of its principal axes @xmath55 : @xmath56.\\ ] ] here @xmath57 is a step function : @xmath58 for @xmath59 and 0 for @xmath60 .",
    "the density contrast within the ellipsoid @xmath61 is @xmath62 we adopt spheroidal symmetry , @xmath63 .",
    "then the poisson equation ( [ eq3 ] ) yields the gravitational potential @xmath64 as @xmath65 with @xmath66 , \\quad     a_3(t ) = \\frac{2}{3 } [ 1 - 2 h(t)].\\ ] ] for an oblate case @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 with the ellipticity @xmath69 ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] for a prolate case @xmath70 , we have ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) have typographical errors . ]",
    "@xmath71 with the ellipticity @xmath72 ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] these equations are derived in binney & tremaine ( 1987 ,  2.3 ) .",
    "we consequently obtain the equation of motion ( [ eq2 ] ) for the half - lengths @xmath73 @xmath74 the evolution of the half - lengths @xmath73 describes the evolution of the homogeneous spheroid .",
    "[ [ s32 ] ] za ~~    equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) yield the equation for the evolution of the half - lengths @xmath73 in the za : @xmath75 the za equation of motion ( [ eq6 ] ) is @xmath76 the factor @xmath77 is larger along the minor axis of the spheroid than that along the major axis .",
    "hence , also in the za , the gravitational collapse is more significant along the minor axis .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath78 or @xmath79 accordingly increases .      equation ( [ eq27 ] ) is numerically solved to obtain the evolution of the homogeneous spheroid . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the einstein - de sitter model ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , but the results could qualitatively apply to any cosmological model .",
    "the initial axis ratio @xmath82 or @xmath83 is 2 , 4 , or 8 .",
    "the initial density contrast is @xmath84 . the initial velocity @xmath85 is determined using the za ( eq . [ [ eq28 ] ] ) .",
    "we also obtain the evolution in the za .",
    "table 1 shows the scale factor at the moment of complete collapse @xmath86 .",
    "it is evident that , in a lower dimensional collapse , the za provides a more accurate result .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the results for oblate collapses @xmath87 and for prolate collapses @xmath88 , respectively , as a function of the normalized scale factor @xmath89 ( _ solid lines _ ) . for reference ,",
    "the solutions for the one - dimensional planar , two - dimensional cylindrical , and three - dimensional spherical collapses are also shown ( _ dotted lines _ ) .",
    "first , we discuss the evolution of the half - lengths ( figs .",
    "1@xmath90 and 2@xmath90 ) .",
    "the collapse is rapid along the minor axis , while it is slow along the major axis . in the oblate cases ( fig .",
    "1@xmath90 ) , the collapse asymptotically becomes one - dimensional .",
    "the collapse along the minor axis is intermediate between the one- and three - dimensional collapses .",
    "if the initial axis ratio @xmath82 is large , the collapse is close to the one - dimensional collapse . in the prolate cases ( fig .",
    "2@xmath90 ) , the collapse asymptotically becomes two - dimensional .",
    "the collapse along the minor axis is intermediate between the two- and three - dimensional collapses .",
    "if the initial axis ratio @xmath83 is large , the collapse is close to the two - dimensional collapse .",
    "second , for the gravitational acceleration along the minor axis , we compare the za with the true numerical solution ( figs .",
    "1@xmath91 and 2@xmath91 ) . in the oblate cases ( fig .",
    "1@xmath91 ) , the za s accuracy is intermediate between those in the one- and three - dimensional collapses .",
    "if the initial axis ratio is large , the za s accuracy is close to that in the one - dimensional collapse in which the za is identical to the true solution .",
    "this is because , as shown in figure 1@xmath90 , the collapse is close to the one - dimensional collapse . in the prolate cases ( fig .",
    "2@xmath91 ) , the za s accuracy is intermediate between those in the two- and three - dimensional collapses .",
    "if the initial axis ratio is large , the za s accuracy is close to that in the two - dimensional collapse .",
    "this is because , as shown in figure 2@xmath90 , the collapse is close to the two - dimensional collapse .",
    "the relative accuracy is the same if the za is compared with the true numerical solution along the density contrast @xmath92 in figure 3 .",
    "third , for the density contrast , we compare the za with the true numerical solution ( figs .",
    "1@xmath93 and 2@xmath93 ) . in the oblate cases ( fig .",
    "1@xmath93 ) , the za s accuracy is intermediate between those in the one- and three - dimensional collapses .",
    "if the initial axis ratio is large , the za s accuracy is close to that in the one - dimensional collapse . in the prolate cases ( fig .",
    "2@xmath93 ) , the za s accuracy is intermediate between those in the two- and three - dimensional collapses .",
    "if the initial axis ratio is large , the za s accuracy is close to that in the two - dimensional collapse .",
    "the za is less accurate in the density contrast than in the gravitational acceleration at the late stage of the evolution .",
    "this is because complete collapse occurs earlier in the true numerical solution than in the za ( table 1 ) .",
    "the za is the linear approximation to replace @xmath20 with @xmath21 for the gravitational acceleration in the lagrangian equation of motion ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq2 ] ] and [ [ eq6 ] ] ) .",
    "this approximation becomes progressively more accurate in the order of three- , two- , and one - dimensional collapses ( eq . [ [ eq18 ] ] ) .",
    "the reason is that , in a lower dimensional collapse , the gravity @xmath52 is more independent of the distance @xmath37 , and the change of the integrated density contrast @xmath53 is closer to the displacement @xmath94 . for the one - dimensional collapse ,",
    "the za s gravitational acceleration is exact .",
    "the spheroidal collapse preferentially proceeds along the minor axis , i.e. , the direction of the strongest gravitational acceleration ( figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "while an oblate spheroid asymptotically undergoes a one - dimensional collapse , a prolate spheroid asymptotically undergoes a two - dimensional collapse .",
    "the dimension of the collapse decreases in the course of the collapse .",
    "this is well reproduced in the za .",
    "the za s gravitational acceleration remains close to the true gravitational acceleration .    during structure formation in the real universe ,",
    "an overdense region preferentially collapses along the direction of the strongest gravitational acceleration .",
    "the collapse asymptotically becomes one - dimensional as in the case of oblate spheroidal collapse .",
    "therefore , the za is accurate for the following reasons .",
    "first , the za is more accurate in a lower dimensional collapse ( see also yoshisato et al .",
    "second , any gravitational collapse preferentially proceeds along the direction of the strongest gravitational acceleration , and it becomes progressively lower dimensional with the passage of time . that is , the za is accurate because the essence of the gravitational collapse is incorporated in the za .",
    "this conclusion applies to other approximations based on the za , e.g. , the truncated za ( coles et al . 1993 ) .",
    "such an approximation has inherited the za s dependence of accuracy on the dimensionality of the gravitational collapse ( see also yoshisato et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "our study is based on buchert ( 1989 ) , in which the za s gravitational acceleration was found to be exact for a one - dimensional collapse .",
    "this finding was for local motions .",
    "we have shown that this is also true for global motions .",
    "we have also shown that the za s gravitational acceleration is closer to the true gravitational acceleration in a lower dimensional collapse .",
    "the usual explanation for the za s accuracy , especially in the density , is that the density contrast is a nonlinear function of the displacement ( catelan 1995 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 ) . even if the displacement is small and",
    "lies in the linear regime , the corresponding density contrast could be large and lie in the nonlinear regime .",
    "for a given change of the displacement , the corresponding change of the density contrast is larger in a higher dimensional collapse ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq18 ] ] ) .",
    "the za should be more accurate in a higher dimensional collapse , according to this usual explanation .",
    "however , in practice ( figs . 13",
    "; see also yoshisato et al .",
    "1998 ) , the za is more accurate in a lower dimensional collapse .",
    "the za has long been known to be exact for a one - dimensional collapse ( doroshkevich et al .",
    "however , with this property alone , it is impossible to explain the za s accuracy .",
    "this is because , in general , gravitational collapse is not exactly one - dimensional .",
    "our study has clarified that , even if the gravitational collapse is not exactly one - dimensional , the za is sufficiently accurate .",
    "thus we have successfully explained why the za is accurate .",
