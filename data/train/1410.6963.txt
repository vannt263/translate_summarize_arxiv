    "the study of hadronic structure with baryon - meson degrees of freedom in the non - perturbative low energy regime of qcd has proved to be rather successful with applications of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "the role of chpt in our understanding of hadron structure has very broad spectrum of goals , ranging from the precise calculations of hadron formfactors to the studies of polarizabilities .",
    "our attention goes to the polarizabilities , because their values clearly reflect dynamical response of the mesons and baryons to the external electromagnetic probe . to date our knowledge of the polarizabilities",
    "is limited by the many experimental challenges , and only reliable information is available for the proton s electric and magnetic polarizabilities : @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "that is explained by the fact that polarizabilities are accessible through the real or some form of virtual compton scattering and only experiments involving stable and charged target particle , such as proton , have sufficient statistical significance . as a result ,",
    "polarizability of the neutron is less understood and plagued by the large uncertainties : @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . as for the simplest @xmath4 state , such as meson ( @xmath5 ) , situation is even more complicated due to the meson short lifetime @xmath6 sec . up to now , only charged and neutral pion polarizabilities have been measured , producing broad range of values @xcite . in order to improve precision of charged pion polarizability , at jefferson laboratory , gluex collaboration will measure polarizability through the primakoff pion photo - production reaction",
    ". calculations of polarizabilities in chpt also have been completed for the pions up to order of @xmath7 @xcite , and for kaons up to order @xmath8 in @xcite . in this short paper",
    "we update calculations of the polarizabilities for su(3 ) octet of mesons using computational hadronic model @xcite with extension to lightest vector mesons .",
    "moreover we produce analysis of energy dependence of meson polarizabilities and study their impact on the photon fusion cross sections @xmath9 relevant to the primakoff two - meson photo - production process .",
    "meson electric and magnetic polarizabilities are determined from the compton structure functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 arising in the compton scattering : @xmath12    @xmath13    polarizabilities represented in eq.[eq:1 ] are energy dependent and hence we will call them dynamical . in the limit , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we recover static values of the polarizabilities .",
    "compton structure functions from eq.[eq:1 ] are related to the compton tensor @xmath16 , which enters compton amplitude ( @xmath17 ) computable in chm .",
    "lorentz tensors @xmath18 have the following simple structure :    @xmath19    in eq.[eq:2 ] , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are momenta of incoming / outgoing photon and meson respectively .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "results for the static electric and magnetic polarizabilities , produced with the help of chm , can be found in @xcite . since the experimental values of the polarizabilities are extracted from the photon fusion cross section @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) , it is more convenient to rotate compton scattering from t- to s - plane and use eq.[eq:1 ] with crossing symmetry @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in this case",
    "static values of the polarizabilities are recovered from the following limits : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "using eq.[eq:1 ] and neglecting structure - dependent vector meson pole contribution , in fig.[fig1 ] , we show results reproduced by chm for dynamical electric polarizabilities of mesons ( here , we have used @xmath29 ) .",
    "in order to study impact of the polarizabilities on @xmath9 cross section we recall the following expression @xcite :    @xmath30    here @xmath31 and @xmath32 stands for the charge of meson , @xmath33 is the center of mass velocity of produced pair of mesons .",
    "parameter @xmath34 or @xmath35 for the case of a neutral or charged meson , respectively .",
    "substituting polarizabilities from eq.[eq:1 ] to eq.[eq:3 ] , we show dependencies for the @xmath9 cross section on invariant mass of the produced pair of mesons in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "first , it is quite noticeable that all meson polarizabilities on the fig.[fig1 ] have rather strong energy dependence . unlike baryon",
    "dynamic polarizabilities @xcite , su(3 ) meson electric and magnetic polarizabilities exhibit strong excitation mechanism in the low energy domain and have similar slopes . at the region of the pion production peak",
    ", electric polarizability has the same resonance type shape for all su(3 ) mesons .",
    "same could be said for the magnetic polarizability . at the order of @xmath8 of chpt , condition",
    "@xmath36 arises from the fact that compton structure function @xmath11 is close to zero , and only first significant non - zero contribution to @xmath11 is derived from two - loop @xmath7 calculations . for the charged pion ,",
    "@xmath7 calculations have been carried out in @xcite and it was shown that two - loop calculations have strong impact on @xmath37 magnetic polarizability .",
    "it would be important to see the @xmath7 type of calculations for the polarizabilities completed for the rest of su(3 ) mesons and the analysis of their dynamical behavior is carried out . as for the @xmath38 cross sections , shown on the fig.[fig2 ] , it is clear that changes in the charged pion polarizability from its static to the dynamic value has only small impact on @xmath39 cross section ( lower left plot on fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this should certainly provide some degree of model - independence when it comes to extraction of the charged pion polarizabilities from primakoff cross section .",
    "for the rest of mesons , cross - sections are very sensitive to the variations in the polarizability .",
    "for example , if we take cross section @xmath40 calculated with polarizability taken as static value ( dot - dashed and blue graph on the lower right part of fig.[fig2 ] ) and compare it to the cross section computed with dynamic polarizability ( dashed and green graph on the lower right part of fig.[fig2 ] ) , we can see that difference is quite large for the entire region of @xmath41 invariant masses . for the neutral mesons static polarizabilities are close or equal to zero ( @xmath42 ) and",
    "hence difference in cross sections is even more dramatic ( we even do not show cross sections for the neutral mesons computed with the static polarizabilities because their values are close to zero ) . in general , we observe very large sensitivity of the @xmath43 cross sections ( except for the charged pion ) to the variations in the meson polarizability . obviously , meson polarizability calculated in the different models will be strongly reflected in the different shapes of the @xmath43 cross section .",
    "essential interest goes to the charged kaon polarizability . here , we have second largest ( after charged pion ) photo - production cross section and its shape is strongly correlated to the model in which polarizability was calculated .",
    "it would be rather important to measure energy dependence of @xmath44 cross section and extract charged kaon polarizability .",
    "this in turn should shed some light on the effective models we are currently using in the low energy qcd ."
