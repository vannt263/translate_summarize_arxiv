    "an alternative approach to representation theory for _ quantum invariants _ is provided by _",
    "skein theory_. the word `` skein '' and the notion were introduced by conway in 1970 for his model of the _ alexander polynomial_. this idea became really useful after the work of kauffman @xcite which redefined the _ jones polynomial _ in a very simple and combinatorial way passing through the _ kauffman bracket_. these combinatorial techniques allow us to reproduce all quantum invariants arising from the representations of @xmath2 without any reference to representation theory .",
    "this also leads to many interesting and quite easy computations .",
    "this skein method was used by various authors @xcite to re - interpret and extend some of the methods of representation theory .",
    "the first notion in skein theory is the one of `` _ _ skein vector space _ _ '' ( or _ skein module _ ) .",
    "these are vector spaces ( @xmath3-modules ) associated to oriented 3-manifolds , where the base field is equipped with a fixed invertible element @xmath4 .",
    "these were introduced independently in 1988 by turaev @xcite and in 1991 by hoste and przytycki @xcite .",
    "we can think of them as an attempt to get an algebraic topology for knots : they can be seen as homology spaces obtained using isotopy classes instead of homotopy or homology classes . in fact they are defined taking a vector space generated by sub - objects ( _ framed links _ ) and then quotienting them by some relations . in this framework , the following questions arise naturally and are still open in general :    @xmath5    * are skein spaces ( modules ) computable ? * how powerful are them to distinguish 3-manifolds and links ?",
    "* do the vector spaces ( modules ) reflect the topology / geometry of the 3-manifolds ( _ e.g. _ surfaces , geometric decomposition ) ?",
    "* does this theory have a functorial aspect ? can it be extended to a functor from a category of cobordisms to the category of vector spaces ( modules ) and linear maps ?    skein spaces ( modules ) can also be seen as deformations of the ring of the @xmath6-_character variety _ of the 3-manifold @xcite .",
    "moreover they are useful to generalize the kauffman bracket , hence the jones polynomial , to manifolds other than @xmath7 .",
    "thanks to result of hoste - przytycki @xcite and ( with different techniques ) to costantino @xcite , now we can define the kauffman bracket also in the connected sum @xmath8 of @xmath9 copies of @xmath10 .    until now there are only few 3-manifolds whose skein space ( module ) is known ,",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "another natural question is :    is the skein vector space of a closed oriented 3-manifold always finite generated ?    in this paper we take as base field the set @xmath11 of all rational functions with rational coefficients and abstract variable @xmath4 , and then we note that every result in this work holds also for the field @xmath12 of complex numbers with @xmath13 a non null number such that @xmath14 for every @xmath15 .",
    "the skein space @xmath16 of the 3-torus @xmath17 is finitely generated .",
    "a set of @xmath0 generators is given by the empty set @xmath18 , some simple closed curves representing the non null elements of the first homology group @xmath19 with coefficients in @xmath1 , and a skein element @xmath20 that is equal to the link consisting of two parallel copies of any previous non empty knots .",
    "our main tool is the algebraic work of frohman and gelca @xcite .",
    "the skein space ( module ) of a ( thickened ) surface has a natural structure of algebra obtained by overlap of framed links . in their work frohman and",
    "gelca gave a nice formula that describes the product in the skein space ( algebra ) @xmath21 of the 2-torus @xmath22 .",
    "a standard embedding of @xmath23 in @xmath24 makes this product commutative , hence we can get further relations from the formula of frohman - gelca .",
    "the author is warmly grateful to bruno martelli for his constant support and encouragement .",
