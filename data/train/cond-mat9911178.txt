    "in a recent experiment the dilute - gas , attractive , bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) was created for the first time for lithium@xcite . as predicted by the nonlinear schrdinger@xcite equation ( nlse ) for three dimensions@xcite ,",
    "the condensate collapsed when the number of particles became large .",
    "however , in one or quasi - one dimension no collapse is predicted  @xcite , and in one dimension the nlse has wide application in fiber optics@xcite as well as other fields@xcite .    in this article",
    "we present stationary solutions to the one - dimensional nlse for attractive nonlinearity under periodic and box boundary conditions . in the preceeding article@xcite we solved the analogous problem for repulsive nonlinearity .",
    "although we will place our results in the context of attractive atomic interactions in the bec , they are equally applicable to wave phenomena in many physical situations , as for example ring lasers@xcite .",
    "we define the bec to be in the quasi - one - dimensional regime when its transverse dimensions are on the order of its healing length and its longitudinal dimension is much longer than its transverse ones . in this case",
    "the 1d limit of the 3d nlse is appropriate , rather than a true 1d mean field theory  @xcite , as would be the case for a transverse dimension on the order of the atomic interaction length . under these criteria",
    "the condensate is well out of the thomas - fermi limit ; i.e. the kinetic energy in the transverse dimensions is very high .",
    "it is this high kinetic energy which prevents the condensate from collapsing .",
    "we have numerically illustrated the stability of the condensate in quasi-1d elsewhere@xcite .    as was shown in the previous article@xcite , in the quasi-1d regime",
    "the solutions are approximately separable , and the dimensionless nlse may be written :    @xmath1\\,f(\\tilde{x } ) = \\tilde{\\mu}\\,f(\\tilde{x } ) \\label{eqn : nlse}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the dimensionless wavefunction describing excitations along @xmath3 , @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 is a dimensionless potential representing the boundary conditions , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , the ratio of the healing length to the box / ring length .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scattering length and @xmath10 is the mean particle density .    for comparison with experiment we list the conversion factor from the unitless @xmath11 to @xmath12 in @xmath12k .",
    "using the formula from the previous article@xcite , for @xmath13li with @xmath14 and @xmath15 nm , the conversion factor is 0.125 . since the unitless chemical potentials we find will be on the order of -1 to -10 this gives a sense of the energy scale of the solutions , on the order of 0.1 to 1.0 @xmath12k .",
    "we also note that throughout our presentation we will use a reasonable test scale of @xmath16 for illustrative purposes .",
    "as @xmath17 is the longitudinal portion of the single particle density , we require the normalization condition :    @xmath18    be satisfied together with the nlse ( [ eqn : nlse ] ) and such boundary conditions as we will describe below .",
    "these are the equations we will solve .",
    "the key concept underpinning the approach taken in this paper is that in a region of constant potential the nlse is integrable .",
    "this was utilized in our companion paper@xcite , and virtually all the techniques applied there to the case of repulsive nonlinearity apply here as well , though they lead to the identification of different particular solutions .",
    "specifically , it was shown in the previous article@xcite that solutions of the stationary nlse on the unit interval , subject to the box boundary conditions    @xmath19    can be expressed , without loss of generality , by purely real functions .",
    "such solutions are given in terms of jacobian elliptic functions , whose properties were reviewed in the previous article .",
    "this result holds independent of the sign of the nonlinearity . for the case of repulsive nonlinearity",
    ", it was established that the sn function provides all possible solutions .",
    "for the attractive case , both the cn and dn functions offer solutions .",

    "[ sec : pbc]c . because the complex solutions interpolate between the cn and dn solutions :    @xmath139    note that @xmath80 is stricly less than @xmath140 .",
    "this is because the phase quanta of the cn solution is actually 0 , not @xmath140 .",
    "@xmath140 is the limiting case , and @xmath32 can be odd , even though an odd - peaked cn solution does not solve the nlse on the ring .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fminscale ] we plot the inverse scale at which each @xmath32 becomes available for the maximum @xmath80 within the range of @xmath80 . for odd @xmath32",
    "this is only half a phase quantum away from @xmath140 , while for even @xmath32 it is a whole phase quantum away .",
    "thus we expect that the odd @xmath32 solutions should become available at lower inverse scales than the even @xmath32 solutions , due to the quantization condition :    @xmath141    for even or odd @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the order of j - peaked solutions turning on as a function of @xmath86 is then : @xmath142 thus for large @xmath86 many more odd than even solutions are available , as again may be seen in the plot .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fminscale ] and in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : evenj ] ) it is apparent that the minimum inverse scale for a complex solution is @xmath102 .",
    "this means that the ground state for less than about 4.5 healing lengths to the box length is the @xmath78 constant solution , rather than the single - peaked @xmath78 dn solution .",
    "this is also the source of the constant factor in the entropy of the nodeless solutions , eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : entropy2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : entropy3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath102 is the minimum size of a peak .    supposing that @xmath86 is large there are then three regimes : for small @xmath32 all solution types are available ; for intermediate @xmath32 even - peaked solutions are cn and go to zero , while odd - peaked solutions are complex and shallow ; and for large @xmath32 only cn solutions are available , so that there are no odd - peaked solutions .      from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nlse ] ) one may consider the negative nonlinear term in the nlse as an effective potential generated by the wavefunction .",
    "as long as the peaks in the wavefunction are well separated then the self - generated troughs do not interact . on a ring one",
    "may treat the well - separated limit as a rotationally symmetric set of @xmath32 potential wells , where @xmath32 is , as before , the number of peaks in the magnitude of the wavefunction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fgroupring5 ] the case for @xmath143 is shown .",
    "this is in complete analogy to the quantum dynamics of a particle in a j - fold rotationally symmetric potential in two dimensions .",
    "such a physical situation is described by the @xmath144 symmetry point group .",
    "the number of irreducible representations of the @xmath144 group determines the degeneracy of the solutions .",
    "thus one may look up the @xmath144 character tables  @xcite in order to find the degeneracy .",
    "consider the case of @xmath143 : from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : evenj ] ) it may be seen that there is a real , @xmath78 , dn solution and two complex solutions , @xmath145 and @xmath146 . as the two complex solutions are each two - fold degenerate there are five solutions in all .",
    "this is identical to the the @xmath147 character table  @xcite : there are one real solution and two doubly - degenerate , intrinsically complex solutions .",
    "the latter are essentially a linear combination of independent bright solitons with coefficients which are simply the appropriate group characters , as familiar to chemists in molecular orbital theory  @xcite .    in the limit that @xmath148 , i.e. that the peaks are well separated , given @xmath32 peaks there are @xmath32 nearly degenerate solutions .",
    "if @xmath32 is even there are 2 real solutions , one symmetric and one antisymmetric , and @xmath149 complex solutions , each two - fold degenerate .",
    "the splitting is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : splitting ] ) .",
    "if @xmath32 is odd there is only one real solution , the symmetric one , and @xmath150 complex solutions , each two - fold degenerate .",
    "an upper bound may be placed on the splitting by applying eq .",
    "( [ eqn : splitting ] ) and keeping in mind that the odd - peaked cn solution is a limiting case on the ring . for both even and odd @xmath32",
    "the ordering of the chemical potentials is as detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pbc]d , with the anti - symmetric solution being the lowest and the other symmetry - breaking solutions being higher in chemical potential as @xmath151 .",
    "there is an additional degeneracy due to symmetry - breaking , as seen in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : entropy1 ] ) , ( [ eqn : entropy2 ] ) , and ( [ eqn : entropy3 ] ) .",
    "thus we have shown by group theoretic considerations that our bright stationary state solutions to the nlse under periodic boundary conditions include all symmetry - breaking eigenstates of evenly spaced peaks identical up to a phase .",
    "the symmetry of the ground state of the nlse on a ring is scale - dependent .",
    "for @xmath152 the ground state is a constant ; for @xmath153 it is single - peaked , symmetry - breaking , and nodeless .",
    "the width of this peak is about @xmath154 . recalling the definition of @xmath40 , for fixed l ,",
    "i.e. a fixed trap size , we may consider the symmetry - breaking as a function of either particle number or scattering length .",
    "the former case corresponds to the experimental situation of adiabatic accretion of particles in quasi-1d .",
    "the latter corresponds to the tuning of a scattering length , by a feshbach resonance  @xcite or other means .",
    "thus one expects under adiabatic growth of the condensate to observe the density of the attractive bec , as a function of the number of atoms trapped , to be constant , then to peak in the middle , thereby breaking symmetry , and finally to disappear from view as the width of the peak becomes less than the wavelength of the imaging radiation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fadiabatring ] we show this sequence of events in four stages superimposed on each other . under box boundary conditions",
    "one expects a similiar occurrence .",
    "although the ground state is not a constant , it is quite broad for @xmath155 . as @xmath86 increases ,",
    "the ground state becomes steadily sharper until it is no longer visible under the imaging radiation .    though it has been shown that the nlse models the bec quite well in the repulsive case , it has been unclear as to how well it models the physics of the attractive case .",
    "there have been relatively few experiments with attractive interactions , and analysis of the nlse in a three - dimensional trapped condensate suggested a small upper limit on the number of atoms that can be maintained in a stable condensate@xcite .",
    "we predict that in quasi-1d , i.e. for transverse dimensions on the order of @xmath156 , a slow enough accretion of particles to the attractive condensate will have the sequence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fadiabatring ] for the ring and a similiar sequence for the box .",
    "an experiment looking for such a change in the shape of the ground state could answer two questions at once : whether there are bright solitons and whether the nlse is a useful model for the attractive bec . if it can be shown that the nlse models the attractive bec in quasi-1d then there are a plethora of rich phenomena in fiber optics which could have a direct analogue in the bec .      for @xmath152 we have shown that the constant solution is the ground state .",
    "we have discussed the case of adiabatic changes in the particle number or the scattering length .",
    "let us now consider _ non - adiabatic _ changes .",
    "we first note that the depth of the dn solutions is highly scale dependent .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pbcnormconddn ] ) in the limit as @xmath42 for @xmath86 :    @xmath157    for each @xmath158 there is a scale for which the real , j - peaked dn solution is in fact a constant . near these scales",
    "the dn has shallow modulations .",
    "midway between these scales it is exponentially close to zero between the peaks . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmodinstability ] we plot such a sequence for the @xmath143 solution .",
    "the four plots of the wavefunction maintain the same phase quantum number , @xmath78 , yet vary greatly in depth with only a small fluctuation of scale .",
    "this extreme sensitivity in the form of the solutions to an external parameter , here @xmath86 , is akin to the modulational instability found in fiber optics , in which a continuous wave laser picks up highly variable sidebands in response to small changes in the power  @xcite .",
    "if the scattering length is positive then the bec is repulsive and the ground state on a ring is the constant solution . using a feshbach resonance the scattering length may be tuned rapidly negative . in the case of @xmath159na",
    "the condensate has been experimentally observed to disappear from view when the scattering length becomes negative  @xcite , with various explanations based on atomic recombination mechanisms  @xcite . in the case of @xmath160rb",
    "the condensate shrank to below the resolution limit and then emitted a burst of high - energy atoms  @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that the stationary nlse provides a mechanism for the apparent destruction of the condensate even in the absence of recombination , at least in the quasi-1d approximation .",
    "for a fast transition in the scattering length we expect the constant solution , in response to noise , to be able to easily shift to a many - peaked soliton solution without having to change phase quantum number",
    ". it may even be possible to control the form of this transition by using intentional noise to induce the desired j - peaked soliton train solution .",
    "induced modulation has proven quite useful in fiber optics , as for example in the creation of a new kind of laser  @xcite .",
    "we have presented the complete set of stationary solutions to the nonlinear schrdinger equation under periodic and box boundary conditions in one dimension for the case of attractive nonlinearity . in a box",
    "all solutions may be taken to be real . on a ring",
    "there are four solution types : constant amplitude solutions which are plane waves ; real symmetry - breaking solutions with nodes ; real nodeless symmetry - breaking solutions ; and a novel class of complex , symmetry - breaking , nodeless solutions .",
    "all symmetry - breaking stationary states on the ring are described by the theory of point symmetry groups .",
    "constant amplitude solutions and real solutions with nodes are in one - to - one correspondence with those of the analogous particle - on - a - ring and particle - in - a - box problems in linear quantum mechanics .",
    "nodeless , symmetry - breaking solutions are uniquely nonlinear",
    ". solutions of non - constant amplitude may be treated as bright soliton - trains .",
    "as the natural size of a density - peak is @xmath102 , the minimum scale size needed to obtain nodeless solutions is @xmath161 . as a consequence ,",
    "the form of the ground state depends on @xmath162 , which in the context of the bec means that as atoms accrete the ground state on the ring breaks symmetry .",
    "in addition to describing the properties and physical meaning of stationary states in detail , we have made experimental predictions specific to the bec .",
    "the creation of an attractive bec in the quasi - one - dimensional regime could answer two questions at once : is the nlse with attractive nonlinearity a good model ; and can one observe solitons ? thus far experiments have only been performed in the three - dimensional regime .",
    "the quasi - one - dimensional solutions presented in this work may suggest further experiments .",
    "elsewhere we have illustrated such solutions numerically  @xcite .",
