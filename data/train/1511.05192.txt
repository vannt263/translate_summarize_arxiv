    "<S> a compound poisson process whose randomized time is an independent poisson process is called compound poisson process with poisson subordinator . </S>",
    "<S> we provide its probability distribution , which is expressed in terms of the bell polynomials , and investigate in detail both the special cases in which the compound poisson process has exponential jumps and normal jumps . </S>",
    "<S> then for the iterated poisson process we discuss some properties and provide convergence results to a poisson process . the first - crossing - time problem for the iterated poisson process is finally tackled in the cases of ( i ) a decreasing and constant boundary , where we provide some closed - form results , and ( ii ) a linearly increasing boundary , where we propose an iterative procedure to compute the first - crossing - time density and survival functions .    </S>",
