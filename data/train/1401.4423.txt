    "+ in the first section of this paper we will focus on these semifinite spectral triples , in particular we will consider the dimension spectrum @xcite of semifinite spectral triples and we will deal with products of semifinite spectral triples . combining this , one can obtain a semifinite spectral triple of ` dimension ' @xmath10 from the @xmath2-dimensional triple and a spin - manifold of dimension @xmath11",
    ". we will construct the product of semifinite spectral triples , this is a natural generalisation of the product of ordinary spectral triples and then we will show that the product preserves finite summability and regularity .",
    "in the second part of this paper we will give the construction of the @xmath2-dimensional semifinite spectral triples .",
    "we will elaborate on why they can be considered as a generalisation of a geometric space of dimension @xmath2 and we will compare our construction with the definition of connes and marcolli . in particular we will pay attention to the ` dimension spectrum ' , this is a subset of @xmath12 which is a generalisation of the dimension of manifolds to spectral triples .",
    "connes and moscovici @xcite use the operator @xmath13 in their definition of the dimension spectrum .",

    "an alternative definition of the ` dimension spectrum ' uses the operator @xmath14 which in this case is well - defined .",
    "however this definition has as a disadvantage that computations are a lot more complicated .",
    "in the last part of this paper we will show that these semifinite spectral triples can indeed be used to define integrals in @xmath2 dimensions so that we obtain a little more concrete picture of dimensional regularisation .",
    "we will not build a full theory , but we will work out an example in details which illustrates the main ideas .",
