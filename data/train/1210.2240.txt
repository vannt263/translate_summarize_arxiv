    "modern permanent magnetic materials , like smco@xmath0 and ndfe@xmath3b , are based on intermetallic compounds of rare - earth and 3d transition metals .",
    "sm - co intermetallics are hard magnetic materials with a high coercive field and a high uniaxial magnetocrystaline anisotropy , where the easy axis is aligned along the crystallographic @xmath4-axis . since the 1970s/1980s many groups investigated the properties of sm - co crystals and thin films .",
    "the control of the composition and the crystallographic texture are the key parameters to obtain thin films with the desired hard magnetic properties .",
    "these properties are interesting from both a technical and a fundamental point of view .",
    "the further miniaturization of magnetic microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite requires the control of such films . but also the combination between a hard magnet like smco@xmath0 with soft magnets @xcite or superconductors @xcite is an unexplored area that can lead to interesting and useful magnetic configurations .",
    "in the last years , recipes have been developed to grow films with the desired hard magnetic properties .",
    "one way to obtain them is to grow epitaxial thin films .",
    "epitaxial growth can be obtained by using mgo(100 ) , mgo(110 ) and si(100 ) single crystals , commonly in combination with a chromium buffer layer . growing sm - co films on the four - fold symmetric mgo(100 ) substrates results in the epitaxial relation sm - co(11 - 20)[0001]//cr(001)[110]//mgo(001)[100 ] , where in the film the sm - co grains are equally distributed along the two in - plane directions .",
    "sm - co films can also be deposited on a glass substrate .",
    "growing on glass results in very small crystallites in a disordered structure , and yields large coercive fields @xcite .",
    "most groups grow thin sm - co films using pulsed - laser deposition ( pld ) @xcite or sputter deposition @xcite from single elemental targets sm and co. by tuning the sputter power of both sources or the pulse ratio by pld , it is possible to grow compositions in the desired range .",
    "also the influence of the substrate temperature has been studied , for obtaining epitaxial films .",
    "the effect on the film growth of the sputter background pressure is often not taken into account .",
    "still , the sputter pressure plays an important role in the growth kinetics and one recent study showed that changes in the stoichiometry and magnetic properties occur when varying the pressure @xcite .",
    "one of the underlying problems is the complexity of the sm - co phase diagram @xcite in which , on the co - rich side , the compounds sm@xmath1co@xmath5 ( 11  % sm ) , smco@xmath6 ( 17  % sm ) , sm@xmath0co@xmath7 ( 21  % sm ) and sm@xmath1co@xmath8 ( 22  % sm ) all exist ; with the note that smco@xmath0 actually is a metastable compound .",
    "the connection between composition and magnetic properties is therefore not trivial .",
    "fortunately , high coercive fields can be found over a range of compositions and a number of studies has focused on this particular aspect .",
    "+ in this paper , we show that by varying the argon pressure , we are able to grow smco@xmath0-like and sm@xmath1co@xmath2-like phases from an alloy target , with good crystallographic texture , coercive field and saturation magnetization . the properties of the grown films are shown to be very sensitive to the sputter pressure used .     +",
    "the sm - co films were deposited in a uhv chamber ( base pressure 1  @xmath9   10  @xmath10 mbar ) using dc magnetron sputter deposition with argon as plasma from a commercially obtained alloy target with a nominal composition of smco@xmath0 ( 3n ) . a rotating sample holder was used .",
    "the deposition rate was measured by x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) using cu - k@xmath11 radiation .",
    "films were deposited on 500 @xmath12 m thick mgo(100 ) single crystal substrates on which a 100 nm thick cr buffer layer was first deposited at 250@xmath13c in an ar pressure of 1.5  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar .",
    "all sm - co films were approximately 100 nm thick and were grown at 450@xmath13c with an ar pressure varying between 1.5  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar and 12.5  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar .",
    "afterwards , a 10 nm thick cr layer was deposited at 450@xmath13c as a protection layer .",
    "the actual film composition and thickness were determined using rutherford backscattering ( rbs ) .",
    "the structural quality of the film was measured with @xmath15-@xmath16 x - ray diffractometry ( xrd ) using cu - k@xmath11 radiation , where the mgo substrate peak was measured as a reference for the angle , by using an extra cu - absorber to decrease the intensity .",
    "the morphology of the films was characterized by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) in tapping mode .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed in a squid - based magnetometer ( mpms 5s from quantum design ) in fields up to 5 t. for the magnetization measurements , the substrates were cut in pieces of approximately 10  @xmath17  4   mm@xmath18 . as a reference , an mgo(100 )",

    "the magnetization was calculated by dividing the measured magnetic moment by the measured volume of the sm - co films ( typically 10 mm @xmath17 4 mm @xmath17 100 nm ) .",
    "all samples show hysteretic behavior with a square - like loop and a large coercivity , of the order of 3  t , but also a substantial diamagnetic contribution .",
    "separate measurements on an mgo(100 ) substrate and an mgo(100)/cr(100 nm)/cu(30 nm ) film show that , at room temperature , the magnetic susceptibility @xmath28 of mgo for substrates from different batches varied and the samples measured had a magnetic susceptibility of -2.4 and -3.5  @xmath9  10@xmath29  emu / g .",
    "these values are in agreement with @xmath28 = -5.1  @xmath9  10@xmath29  emu / g for a single - crystal mgo @xcite .    for the films grown at 1.5 , 3.0 and 9.0  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar ,",
    "the coercive field @xmath30 is approximately 2.5  t and the saturation magnetization @xmath31 is approximately @xmath32 t. the film grown at 6.0  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar has a slightly higher coercive field of 3.0  t and a significantly larger saturation magnetization of 0.87  t. both @xmath30 and @xmath31 as a function of sputter pressure are given in figure  [ fig : figure_5 ] .",
    "again we find clear trends : with increasing pressure up to 6  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar @xmath30 slowly increases from 2.6  t to 3.3  t , but above 6  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar a rapid decrease sets in , down to 1.8  t at 12  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar .",
    "the saturation magnetization is 0.3 - 0.4  t in the whole pressure range , but clearly visible is the much higher saturation magnetization of the film grown at 6.0  @xmath9   10@xmath14 mbar . to characterize the magnetic texture ,",
    "the ratio of the remnance of the in - plane and out - of - plane magnetizations was determined for the films grown at 1.5 and 6.0  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar ( not shown ) .",

    "[ fig : figure_6 ] , the uncorrected magnetization hysteresis loops for a sm - co film grown at 10.5  @xmath9  10@xmath14   mbar are shown as a function of temperature . for temperatures",
    "down to 30  k , the coercive field and the saturation magnetization increase slowly .",
    "also , the diamagnetic contribution of the substrate becomes smaller .",
    "when going to even lower temperatures , the hysteresis loop shows a clear paramagnetic behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_7](a ) shows the uncorrected hysteresis loop for two mgo substrates from different batches at 4  k. also here the low temperature magnetization measurements show a clear paramagnetic behavior .",
    "electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) measurements were done to identify the paramagnetic impurities .",

    "clearly visible are the resonance lines of cr@xmath33 , v@xmath34 and mn@xmath34 impurities @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure_8 ] , the uncorrected and corrected magnetization hysteresis loops at 4.2  k for a sm - co film grown at 2.3  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar are shown .",
    "clearly visible is that the uncorrected loop is a minor loop , where the remanent magnetization for both the positive and negative field sweep has the same high and positive value .",
    "the magnetization hysteresis loop is corrected by subtracting the magnetization of the impurities .",
    "the corrected hysteresis loop is almost field independent , showing that the coercive field is larger than 5  t.    10@xmath14  mbar as a function of temperature .",
    "for the 10  k and 4  k loop , the 5  t magnet of the magnetometer is not strong enough to reach the coercive field of the sm - co film and the contribution of the mgo substrate increases significantly . ]",
    "10@xmath14  mbar at 4.2k.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "summarizing the experimental findings , we see that with increasing sputter pressure , the lattice parameters and the values for @xmath30 increase until the pressure of 6.0  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar is reached , where the lattice parameter corresponds to the sm@xmath1co@xmath2 alloy . at this pressure",
    "@xmath31 increases sharply . increasing the pressure further",
    ", @xmath31 comes down again , while @xmath30 now starts to decrease . in the whole range",
    ", we find the sm content of the films higher than expected from the stoichiometric ratio s of the line compounds .",
    "apparently , the sputter process does not result in a well - defined composition .",
    "in particular , the films are not a mixture of the smco@xmath0 and sm@xmath1co@xmath2 compounds , which would result in two lines with different weight in the x - ray data .",
    "rather , the films consist of one main composition which is able to incorporate a varying amount of co - atoms , probably in a complex with the detected surplus of sm .",
    "cross sectional transmission electron microscope data @xcite have shown that when the sm - co film is not grown under the optimal conditions , different epitaxial growth modes exist .",
    "the film does not grow with a full crystalline structure and amorphous areas are formed where the remaining material is stored .",
    "the surface morphology in figure [ fig : figure_3 ] shows that the grain size and grain shape changes when the sputter pressure is changed . at high pressures ,",
    "relatively large rectangular grains are grown .",
    "when reducing the pressure , the grains become smaller and more square - like .",
    "we surmise this is due to the change in average energy of the atoms bombarding the substrate : at low pressure , this energy is higher and as a result , more defects are created during the growth of the first sm - co layers . when the number of defects becomes larger , also the number of preferred nucleation sites increases .",
    "the increase in the number of nucleation sites results in a reduced grain size and a more rough surface .",
    "magnetically , the picture is somewhat complicated by the paramagnetic behavior of the mgo substrates , which is due to transition metal impurities , in particular mn , v , and cr .",
    "their amount varies from batch to batch .",
    "the low temperature magnetic hysteresis shows a clear paramagnetic behavior superimposed on it , so we assume that the magnetization @xmath35 of these impurities can be described by the brillouin function    @xmath36    with @xmath37 the number of atoms , @xmath38 the g - factor , @xmath39 the bohr magneton , @xmath40 the total angular momentum , @xmath41 boltmans constant and @xmath42 the temperature .",
    "the total magnetization for the three different impurities is then modelled as the sum of the magnetization of each type of impurities .    from fitting equation  [ eq : brillouin ] to the low temperature magnetic hysteresis of a bare mgo substrate , we estimate that in the mgo substrates in figure  [ fig : figure_7](a ) , the concentration of the impurities is in the range of 15 - 60  ppm @xcite .",
    "another factor that influences the corrections made to the magnetization is the oxidation of the cr capping layer , which induces an unknown extra magnetization .",
    "magnetically , the properties of the films grown at different sputter background pressures up to 6.0  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar are very similar . at 300  k , the films show a square hysteresis loop for the field applied in the plane of the sample , with a coercive fields of about 3  t and a saturation magnetization of 0.4  t. the films grown with a sputter background pressure above 6.0@xmath23 mbar show a decrease in coercive field , although the sm concentration , lattice constant and saturation magnetization do not change significant with respect to the films grown at pressures below 6.0  @xmath9  10@xmath14 mbar .",
    "we attribute the change in coercive field to the larger grain size of the grown sm - co film .",
    "the grain size of thin sm - co films is hard to control , but the grain size of smco@xmath0 powder can be controlled well by grinding and milling . in experiments with nanoparticles with a different size , it was found that the size has a significant influence on the coercive field and a optimum particle size is approximately 100 - 200 nm @xcite .",
    "only the film grown at 6.0  @xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar shows a large saturation magnetization of 0.87  t. smco@xmath0 and sm@xmath1co@xmath2 crystals have a saturation magnetization @xmath31 of 1.05 and 1.29 t respectively . due to the four - fold symmetry of the mgo(100 ) substrate",
    ", the saturation magnetization of the films will not have this values because part of the sm - co grains are aligned in - plane and the other grains are aligned out - of - plane and do not contribute to the saturation magnetization when measured along the ( 100)- or ( 010)-axis .    the optimal sputter pressure to grow the smco@xmath0-like phase with a larger saturation magnetization might be lower than 1.5@xmath9  10@xmath14  mbar , the lowest pressure at which we can grow films .",
    "this appears also from the fact that the sm@xmath1co@xmath2-like phase can be grown over a large pressure window with a large coercive field but only at a very small pressure window gives a high saturation magnetization , as is shown in figure  [ fig : figure_5 ] .    at 4.2 k ,",
    "the result is a little bit more complicated . when decreasing the temperature , the mgo substrate develops an induced moment .",
    "the mn , cr and v impurities add at low temperatures a paramagnetic contribution .",
    "the variation in the magnetic moment is quite large , as shown in figure  [ fig : figure_7](a ) .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : figure_8 ] shows clearly that the measured magnetic hysteresis loop is not the hysteresis loop itself , but a minor loop , since the coercive field is larger than the 5  t which can be reached in the magnetometer .",
    "when the contribution of the impurities in the mgo substrate is subtracted using equation [ eq : brillouin ] , the sm - co film shows an almost constant magnetization .",
    "a problem of growing sm - co films from an alloy target is , that the film composition is very sensitive to the target composition .",
    "we used a number of different commercially obtained targets which , according to the vendor , where fabricated from the same batch of alloy material .",
    "all targets had a slightly different sm concentration . from figure [",
    "fig : figure_2 ] , it is clear that a small change in sm concentration can change the magnetic and crystallographic properties a lot .",
    "the films grown with the other targets showed coercive fields between 1.0 and 2.0 t. further investigations with cosputtering , confirmed this assumption that a very small change in composition has a huge influence on the grown films . * ? ? ?",
    "*    to conclude , by varying the sputter ar pressure , we can change the phase from a smco@xmath0-like to the sm@xmath1co@xmath2-like phase .",
    "we find that the film composition is extremely sensitive to small variation in target composition and the ar gas pressure used for sputtering .",
    "the grown films have good crystal texture and magnetic properties .",
    "but , the type of film is not as well defined as might be expected .",
