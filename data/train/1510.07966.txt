    "in @xcite , snchez - palencia analyzes the situation in which a species , with population density @xmath0 , splits , due to a number of factors , into two different species with population densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but still keeping the original ecological behavior .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath0 followed a logistics law until time @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 then , after splitting , @xmath5 is assumed to satisfy the lotka - volterra system @xmath6 for @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "note that , under this splitting _ without differentiation _",
    ", @xmath9 still satisfies ( [ sp.1 ] ) for @xmath10 .",
    "although problem ( [ sp.1 ] ) has a unique non - trivial equilibrium , @xmath11 , problem ( [ sp.2 ] ) has a continuum set of non - trivial equilibria given by all the combinations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author analyzes how the differentiation of populations @xmath1 , @xmath2 after splitting , understood as a perturbation in the lotka - volterra coefficients , affects the equilibrium of the system . by splitting _ with differentiation _ we mean that @xmath5 is a solution of the following problem : @xmath15 for @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "observe that , under this splitting , @xmath9 does not satisfy , in general , problem ( [ sp.1 ] ) for @xmath10 .",
    "the main conclusion of @xcite is that the differentiation mechanism selects , in general , a unique solution for the equilibrium system , having therefore a stabilizing effect .      in this article , we extend the previous dynamical system models to the case of space dependent population densities .",
    "we start considering the dynamics of one single species population satisfying @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a bounded domain with lipschitz continuous boundary , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the parabolic boundary of @xmath21 .",
    "the vector @xmath22 is the outwards canonical normal to @xmath18 .",
    "the growth - competition term is assumed to have the logistic form @xmath23 , and the flow to be given by @xmath24 .",
    "as it is well known , the term @xmath25 captures the individuals aversion to overcrowding , while @xmath26 is usually determined by an environmental potential , @xmath27 , whose minima represent attracting points for the populations . for biological background and origins of the model",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "after splitting , the new two populations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , satisfy , for @xmath7 , @xmath30 with @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , and with @xmath33 and @xmath34 to be defined .    assuming , like in the dynamical system model , that the possible differentiation process only takes place through the growth and the inter- and intra - competitive behavior of the new species implies that the split flows must satisfy @xmath35 , that is @xmath36 being clear the way of defining the linear transport term of @xmath33 , the nonlinear diffusive term admits several reasonable decompositions .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the following splitting was considered @xmath37 with @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . under this splitting , problem ( [ p.u2 ] ) takes the form of the cross - diffusion model introduced by shigesada et al .",
    "@xcite , for which a thorough mathematical analysis does exist , see for instance @xcite for numerical approaches , @xcite for analytical and qualitative results , or @xcite for applications .    in this paper , we consider the alternative splitting @xmath40 which brings problem ( [ p.u2 ] ) to the form of the busenberg and travis model @xcite .",
    "although apparently simpler than ( [ def.flows2 ] ) , no general proof of existence of solutions does exist for problem ( [ p.u2 ] ) with flows given by ( [ def.flows ] ) .",
    "however , some partial results related to the cell - growth contact - inhibition problem may be found in @xcite , as well as in @xcite for other specific situations .      according to the species behavior after splitting , we consider two problems arising from two different sets of lotka - volterra terms : @xmath41 for @xmath7 .",
    "we shall refer to problem ( [ p.u2 ] ) with flows given by ( [ def.flows ] ) and with @xmath34 given by ( [ f.nm ] ) and ( [ f.m ] ) as to * problems ( nd ) and ( d ) * , respectively .",
    "observe that these are the pde versions that generalize the non - differentiation and differentiation ode problems ( [ sp.2 ] ) and ( [ sp.3 ] ) , introduced in @xcite .",
    "the existence of solutions of problem ( nd ) was proven in @xcite in the multi - dimensional case . the proof is based on the construction of solutions , @xmath42 , to a nonlinear parabolic regularization of problem ( nd ) such that , although @xmath43 only converges weakly to the solution of the limit problem , @xmath44 , the global density , @xmath45 , converges strongly to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , weak and strong convergences are compensated so that the limit problem ( nd ) is shown to have a solution .",
    "however , since no a.e .",
    "convergence of @xmath43 to @xmath44 was proven in @xcite , the case of differentiated lotka - volterra terms , i.e. problem ( d ) , may not be handled directly with this technique .    previously to @xcite , in the one - dimensional setting and for @xmath47 , bertsch et al .",

    "their proof is based on the parabolic regularization of the auxiliary problem together with the use of the lagrangian flows ( characteristics ) associated to @xmath52 . in particular , and important for the results proven in this article , they obtained _ strong convergence _ of the sequence of approximated solutions to a limit , which is identified as a solution of problem  ( d ) .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to show the existence of solutions of problem ( d ) with an alternative proof to that given in @xcite .",
    "our proof is based on the direct parabolic regularization used for problem ( nd ) in @xcite , and takes advantage of the techniques employed in @xcite to obtain the strong convergence of each component of the regularized problem .",

    "after the proofs of our results in section  [ sec : proof ] , we conclude the article with some conclusions , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we compare the approximated solutions to problem ( d ) constructed via the regularization scheme employed in the proof of theorem  [ th.1 ] , and those corresponding to the approximated problem introduced in @xcite . the formulation of these problems is the following , respectively .",

    "the proof of the convergence of the numerical scheme for problem ( p)@xmath76 may be found in @xcite .",

    "in this section , we present numerical simulations for two sets of initial and lotka - volterra data aiming to clarify the advantages of approximating the solutions of problem ( d ) either by the scheme derived from the regularized parabolic - hyperbolic formulation ( p)@xmath51 of @xcite , or by the direct viscosity approximation introduced in this article , ( p)@xmath76 .",
    "the general conclusion is that approximating the solution , @xmath67 , of problem ( d ) by the sequence @xmath129 of solutions of problem ( p)@xmath76 is more robust against instabilities produced in discontinuity points than that given by the sequence @xmath130 corresponding to ( p)@xmath51 . although we only show the results for two standard examples , we confirmed this conclusion for a variety of data problem .",
    "parameter data was fixed as follows .",
    "in all the examples , we consider the spatial domain @xmath131 and investigate the mesh sizes @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , whereas the time step is empirically chosen as @xmath135 ( in the first experiment ) and @xmath136 ( in the second ) .",
    "the regularization parameters are taken as @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "to avoid negative values of the discrete solutions , we use the functions @xmath139 and @xmath140 , see ( [ landa ] ) and ( [ landamay ] ) , respectively , setting @xmath141 . finally , the tolerance for the fixed point stopping criterion is set to @xmath142 ; in all the examples , we observed good convergence properties of the fixed point algorithm , reaching the prescribed tolerance in less than ten iterations .    in all the cases , the solutions corresponding to problem ( p)@xmath51 produce more oscillations than those of problem ( p)@xmath76 . to measure these oscillations , we compute an approximation to the zero - crossings of @xmath143 in @xmath74 by @xmath144 where @xmath145 stands for the difference between two consecutive node values , and the sum runs over the spatial nodes .",
    "in fact , we may observe that while solutions of ( p)@xmath76 attenuate the oscillations when @xmath146 increases , those corresponding to solutions of ( p)@xmath51 are always above some threshold value .",
    "in addition , in all the experiments we observe that the size of oscillations diminish according to the mesh size , for both approximations .      in this example",
    "we investigate the question ( q2 ) stated in @xcite , concerning the invasion of a population ( which simulates mutated abnormal cells ) over an initially dominant population ( which represents the normal cell ) .",
    "more precisely , we take the initial data @xmath147 besides , we deal with the lotka - volterra coefficients @xmath148 we conducted the experiments for several choices of the mesh size , @xmath94 .",
    "only the experiments corresponding to @xmath132 ( 101 nodes ) , @xmath149 ( 301 nodes ) , and @xmath150 ( 501 nodes ) are shown in figure  [ fig_invasion_sol ] .",
    "we may check that for the finer mesh ( last two rows ) , both approximations give similar results .",
