    "magnetism is ubiquitous in these correlated systems and might provide the key to the understanding of their behavior .    the quest for superconductivity in organic conductors",

    "early efforts towards the chemical synthesis of such compounds were not successful  as far as superconductivity is concerned  , but lead to the realization of a 1d charge transfer salt ( ttf - tcnq ) undergoing a peierls instability at low temperatures.@xcite attempts to suppress the peierls state and stabilize a conducting ( and possibly superconducting ) state by increasing the 3d character of this 1d conductor proved to be unsuccessful .",

    "the existence of strong correlations suggests that the kinetic interchain exchange @xmath38 , which drives the af transition in the sulfur series , still plays an important role in the bechgaard salts . in this picture , the decrease of @xmath47 with increasing pressure is due both to the decrease of @xmath38 and the deterioration of the fermi surface nesting .",

    "for instance , @xmath86 would lead according to ( [ tx ] ) to @xmath87 , a value much below the experimental observations .      on the other hand , there are experiments pointing to the absence of strong correlations in the bechgaard salts .",

    "the position of the resonance peaks is given by the zeros of the bessel function @xmath89 evaluated at @xmath90 ( @xmath10 is the interchain spacing in the @xmath10 direction ) .",
    "this enables a direct measure of the interchain hopping amplitude in the @xmath9 direction , yielding @xmath91 k above the anion ordering transition taking place at 24 k , in very good agreement with values derived from band calculations.@xcite these results can hardly be reconciled with the existence of strong correlations .",
    "sizeable 1d fluctuations should lead to a strong ( @xmath92 ) dependence of the self - energy , and in turn to a significant renormalization of @xmath93-dependent quantities like the interchain hopping amplitudes.@xcite this lends support to the idea that the low - temperature phase of the bechgaard salts can be described as a weakly interacting fermi liquid subject to spin fluctuations induced by the nesting of the fermi surface.@xcite    the weak - coupling approach has been particularly successful in the framework of the quantized nesting model.@xcite the latter explains the cascade of sdw phases induced by a magnetic field in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 and ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath2 , and provides a natural explanation for the quantization of the hall effect  @xmath94 ( @xmath95 integer ) per @xmath60 plane  observed in these phases .",
    "furthermore , it reproduces the experimental phase diagram only for interchain hopping amplitudes @xmath96 close to their unrenormalized values .    despite the apparent success of the weak - coupling approach ,",
