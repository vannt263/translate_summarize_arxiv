    "the statistical equilibrium calculations are performed in horizontally homogeneous lte model atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "this model is nearly the same as that used by carlsson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "all terms are coupled by radiative and collisional interactions as described in more detail in paper i.    we have shown in paper  i that collisional interaction with neutral hydrogen atoms will not affect the results obtained for the solar lines except those in the infrared . however , since neutral hydrogen collision rates do not depend on metal abundance , they can maintain an important influence in metal - poor stellar atmospheres and raise the total collision rates to high enough efficiency at which they can even compensate the strongly increased photoionization .",
    "as outlined in paper  i the hydrogen collisions are based on the formula of drawin ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is most often used in a form due to steenbock & holweger ( @xcite ) although the validity of this formula can not be judged .",
    "we have used it as an order of magnitude estimate and carefully investigated the influence of hydrogen collisions on our atomic model by fitting all available lines modifying drawin s formula by a scaling factor . for",
    "it turns out ( as was the case for aluminium ) that this factor should vary _ exponentially _ with upper level excitation energy @xmath28 ( in ev ) , @xmath29 .",
    "this was determined in a fully empirical manner recomputing the complete nlte line formation with statistical equilibrium equations including the scaled hydrogen collision rates , and it enabled us to fit solar lines of different excitation energies .",
    "the decrease of hydrogen collision cross - sections with excitation energy is also in rough agreement with kaulakys ( @xcite , @xcite ) prediction for rydberg transitions .",
    "the statistical equilibrium is calculated using the detail code ( giddings @xcite ; butler & giddings @xcite ) in a version based on the method of complete linearization as described by auer & heasley ( @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation includes all radiative line transitions , most of them represented by doppler profiles ; 99 lines were linearized .",
    "the mg b lines are treated with full radiative and van der waals damping .",
    "the linearized line transitions were selected from test calculations including different combinations with a preference for the stronger transitions including the @xmath30 levels .",
    "adding more transitions did not change the results .",
    "the bound - free transitions of the lowest 22 levels were linearized , too .    in a star such as the sun the flux in the ultraviolet spectral region",
    "is determined to a large part by opacities due to metal line absorption . as in our analysis of the solar mg spectrum we use the opacity distribution functions of kurucz ( @xcite ) to represent this opacity . in these odf data",
    "single line opacities in small frequency intervals are represented by superlines ; consequently , the odf opacity is not identical to that required at a specific position in frequency space . for the calculation of a model atmosphere",
    "this simplification is a sufficient approximation , but for nlte line formation the actual radiation field across a line transition or an ionization continuum is important for the determination of the statistical equilibrium of an atom . for bound - free transitions",
    "the exact position of the absorbing lines is less important , and the use of the odfs will be reliable , provided the intervals are small enough in the frequency region near the ionization edge . for a bound - bound transition with its narrow line width it can be important in which part of the broad synthetic odf line it is formed .",
    "we include the additional odf opacity in the uv for wavelengths between 1300 and 3860    to allow for a realistic behaviour of the ionization from the ground state and the first excited level without affecting most of the line transitions .",
    "only a few lines are found in this region allowing us to omit additional line opacities as most of these transitions are of minor importance for the statistical equilibrium .",

    "abundance differences between the nlte and lte calculations with various stellar models are shown in table [ nltediff ] .",
    "these results are obtained requiring nlte and lte line formation to fit the same equivalent width .",
    "the results confirm that deviations of the level populations from lte increase with decreasing metal abundance .",

    "it is evident that the nlte effects are systematically stronger for the hotter models , which is in accordance with the statistical equilibrium of aluminium and sodium ( baumller & gehren @xcite ; baumller et al .",
    "the dependence upon temperature is , however , strongly tied to the change in ionization ; as soon as @xmath15  drops below 5300 k , starts to recombine , and becomes more dominant . for stars at the turnoff",
    "the temperature dependence is negligible .",
    "as expected , the strongest departures from lte are found for models with high temperature and low metallicity .",
    "the reduction of surface gravity results in a decreased efficiency of collisions by electron and hydrogen atoms which again leads to slightly stronger nlte effects .",

    "<S> calculations of the statistical equilibrium of magnesium in the solar photosphere have shown that nlte populations hardly affect mg line formation in the sun . however , in metal - poor dwarfs and giants the influence of electron collisions is reduced , and the ultraviolet radiation field , enhanced due to reduced background line opacity , results in more pronounced nlte effects . in the photosphere of a cool star excitation and ionization due to collisions with neutral hydrogen can outweigh electron collisions . analyses based on nlte populations lead to significantly higher mg abundances than those calculated from lte . </S>",
