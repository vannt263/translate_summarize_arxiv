    "isotopic @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures have deserved theoretical and experimental interest for many years due to their unique properties.@xcite among them one may recognize the only isotopic mixture which remains stable at a certain @xmath0he concentration down to zero temperature , and the only liquid system in which the two quantum statistics , bosons ( @xmath1he ) and fermions ( @xmath0he ) , are put together and one influences the other through the interatomic potential . as a result of this interplay , it has been observed both experimentally and theoretically , that the @xmath1he superfluid fraction decreases and simultaneously the @xmath1he condensate fraction increases when the @xmath0he concentration increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0he momentum distribution in the mixture appears largely influenced by the presence of @xmath1he showing a considerably larger depletion above the fermi momentum in comparison with pure @xmath0he .",
    "experimental information on the @xmath1he condensate fraction ( @xmath2 ) and the kinetic energy of both @xmath1he and @xmath0he in the mixture have been recently extracted from deep - inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite these analysis show a large enhancement of @xmath2 with respect to pure @xmath1he , and @xmath0he kinetic energies very similar to the ones of pure @xmath0he .",
    "in contrast , all the theoretical calculations@xcite have shown only an small increment of @xmath2 when the @xmath0he concentration ( @xmath3 ) increases ( mainly due to the change in the total density at a fixed pressure ) and a @xmath0he kinetic energy appreciably larger .",
    "the maximum solubility of @xmath0he in @xmath1he is @xmath4 at zero pressure and presents a maxim value of @xmath5 at @xmath6 atm .",
    "these @xmath3 values are sufficiently small to stimulate the theoretical interest in describing microscopically the limit of zero @xmath0he concentration which , on the other hand , has also been experimentally analyzed and a number of characteristic properties are nowadays available.@xcite from a theoretical viewpoint , this limiting system has been studied considering a single @xmath0he atom solved in bulk @xmath1he .",
    "the most useful approach in the past has been the variational method combined with the resolution of the hypernetted chain equations ( hnc ) coupled@xcite or not@xcite to an euler - lagrange optimization procedure .",
    "the results obtained with this approach reproduces the energetic and structural properties of the system with a good accuracy but the impurity effective mass appears slightly underestimated.@xcite the application of monte carlo methods , both variational@xcite and _ ab initio_,@xcite to the impurity system in order to calculate a basic property as the chemical potential of the impurity in the bulk ( @xmath7 ) , has been seriously hindered by the fact that @xmath7 results from the difference of two energy terms of order @xmath8 , @xmath8 being the number of particles .",
    "in fact , a straightforward application of the monte carlo method can not estimate @xmath7 because the statistical fluctuations would mask it completely .    in the present calculation",
    ", the reported results for @xmath7 have been obtained using a particular reweighting procedure suitable for the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method , which has allowed a direct calculation of @xmath7 with a statistical error reduced to a manageable level . using this method , we have been able to obtain reliable results for @xmath7 that fit accurately the experimental data from the equilibrium up to the freezing @xmath1he densities .",
    "the local environment of the impurity , reflected in the crossed radial distribution and structure functions , has been studied by means of a pure estimator@xcite to remove the bias associated to the trial wave function .",
    "we have , finally , focused our attention to the calculation of the impurity effective mass and its kinetic energy for several densities .",
    "as in previous quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) applications,@xcite the effective mass is extracted from the diffusion coefficient in imaginary time and , in spite of some uncertainties inherent to the extrapolated estimator used in this calculation , a reasonable agreement with recent experimental determinations@xcite is attained .",
    "our results concerning the kinetic energy of the impurity , derived from the hellmann - feynman theorem , avoid the residual importance - sampling dependence and show values which are definitely larger than the experimental data , as pointed out previously in variational@xcite and path integral monte carlo ( pimc)@xcite calculations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly introduce the dmc algorithm for the impurity system and present a dmc reweighting technique that permits a direct estimation of arbitrarily small differences . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results and compare them with available experimental and theoretical data .",
    "we close in sec .",
    "iv with the summary and final remarks .",
    "the dmc method@xcite allows for a very accurate description of the ground - state properties of an interacting @xmath8-body system . in the dmc formulation the imaginary - time schrdinger equation for the function @xmath9 , @xmath10 +    \\left ( e_l({\\bf r } ) -e \\right ) \\ , f({\\bf r},t ) \\ ,   \\label{dmc}\\ ] ] is turned into a stochastic process which provides a sample of configuration points @xmath11 ( walkers ) and weights @xmath12 in a @xmath13-dimensional space , whose probability distribution is given by @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is a time - independent trial wave function that acts as an importance - sampling function , and @xmath16 is the exact wave function of the system . in this form , the schrdinger equation appears as a diffusion - like differential equation with a diffusion , drift and branching terms corresponding to the first , second and third terms of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ dmc ] ) , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ dmc ] ) , @xmath17 is the local energy , @xmath18 is the quantum drift force , and @xmath19 acts as the free - diffusion constant of the @xmath20 particle . at",
    "sufficiently long imaginary times the probability density evolves to a stationary solution given by @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the ground - state wave function from which the exact ground - state energy is obtained as the average of the local energy @xmath23 .",
    "let us now turn to the implementation of the reweighting method . in the dmc algorithm ,",
    "the distribution probability of the walkers is modified in every single operation .",
    "consider in particular the stochastic process originated by the diffusion term , which is a random gaussian displacement @xmath24 . the new weight and distribution probability are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in this stochastic process",
    "we can make use again of importance sampling in order to perform a modified diffusion random displacement . in this case , if the transition probability of going from @xmath11 to @xmath27 following a modified diffusion process is @xmath28 , the new distribution probability is given by @xmath29 the statistical sample of walkers provides unchanged averaged values if one uses accordingly a new weight given by @xmath30 this means that a system can be studied using a variety of diffusion random laws , although the efficiency of the method will be related to the magnitude of the changes .",
    "in general , the modification has to be small enough so that the same configuration space is sampled .",
    "the reweighting method is specially useful in the calculation of differences between two almost identical systems .",
    "performing independent samplings for both systems generates a global uncorrelated noise that prevents a direct measure of the difference .",
    "assume , however , that given a common starting configuration point , a single drift process brings both walkers to new positions @xmath31 and @xmath32 which are very close ( in particular , separated a distance much smaller than the typical size of a random gaussian displacement ) .",
    "the configuration region attainable after a combined drift and diffusion process is the same , and the transition probabilities @xmath33 and @xmath34 are almost equal .",
    "equations [ salt ] and [ wprima ] may be used then to change @xmath33 into @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , there is no need of taking averages using two independent walkers for the two systems , and it may be highly preferable to use _ correlated walkers _ , in the sense of carrying a single random walk to obtain statistical values for both systems .",
    "furthermore , notice that this technique may be applied to modify the diffusion process of the whole walker , i.e. , all the particles of the system , or only a subset of it .",
    "the generalized reweighting method is an appropriate tool for studying the quantum liquid in which we are now interested .",
    "it is composed by @xmath35 @xmath36he particles and one @xmath0he atom ( @xmath37 ) enclosed in a simulation box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath38 and the trial wave function @xmath15 has been chosen to be of jastrow type @xmath39 without distinguishing between the @xmath40 and @xmath41 pairs of particles .",
    "this simplification in the wave function , known as average correlation approximation ( aca ) , has been used in several variational calculations@xcite obtaining a quite good description of the impurity properties . in the dmc method",
    "the trial wave function acts only as a guiding wave function for the walkers driving them to regions where @xmath22 is expected to be large and thus a particular choice , as the aca one in the present case , does not bias the expected value for the ground - state energy . on the other hand , the _ sign _ problem that would emerge in a simulation of a finite @xmath0he concentration in @xmath1he does not appear here and an exact energy for the system , apart from statistical uncertainties , can be safely obtained .    from the energetic viewpoint ,",
    "the more fundamental quantity in the study of the @xmath0he impurity in @xmath1he is the impurity chemical potential or binding energy @xmath42 both energy estimations being evaluated at fixed volume @xmath43 .",
    "if the total number of particles is also conserved , and therefore one @xmath1he atom is substituted by the @xmath0he impurity , @xmath7 is given by @xmath44 we have chosen the second option in which the difference between the two energy estimations is much less density dependent than in eq .",
    "( [ muidef ] ) , and moreover because it is more convenient if a correlated estimation of the difference is intended .",
    "the pure @xmath1he chemical potential @xmath45 entering in eq .",
    "( [ muidif4 ] ) has been determined in a previous work using also the dmc method with a nice agreement with experimental data.@xcite    the drawback of an _ ab initio _",
    "mc estimation of @xmath7 , that has precluded such a calculation for years , is that an independent calculation of @xmath46 and @xmath47 followed by its difference , produces a result completely hidden by the statistical error . in order to overcome this serious problem ,",
    "we have directly sampled the difference by means of the reweighting method above introduced .",
    "our purpose was to perform two correlated dmc runs , one of bulk @xmath1he and the other with one @xmath0he impurity .",
    "in this case , eq .",
    "( [ salt ] ) has allowed us to use the same environment for both the @xmath0he atom in the impurity system and the equivalent @xmath1he atom in the pure liquid .",
    "in fact , the drift of the surrounding @xmath35 particles in eq .",
    "( [ dmc ] ) is almost insensitive to the mass of the impurity , i.e. , the resulting positions in the impurity system ( @xmath48 ) and in the pure phase ( @xmath49 ) are very close . if one decides to change the diffusion process of the environment in the pure system with @xmath50 then the distribution probability of the environment , after the double process of drift and diffusion , is the same for the two systems . in this form ,",
    "the statistical fluctuations coming from regions far from the impurity and its corresponding @xmath1he atom cancel exactly , and the remaining signal corresponds only to their local environment making feasible a direct estimation of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the impurity chemical potential @xmath7 , the knowledge of other properties as the crossed radial distribution function @xmath51 , the impurity effective mass and its kinetic energy are also relevant in a microscopic characterization of the @xmath0he impurity .",
    "expectation values of operators @xmath52 that do not commute with the hamiltonian @xmath53 are however biased because the probability density is @xmath54 and not @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the natural expectation values , called mixed estimators ( m ) , have to be corrected in order to reduce or eliminate this systematic source of error . in the extrapolation methods,@xcite this correction is approximated by @xmath56 or @xmath57 @xmath58 being a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) estimation .",
    "both @xmath59 and @xmath60 are accurate to first order in @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , but in general it is not enough to completely eliminate the influence of @xmath63 in @xmath64 . in order to go beyond this approximation ,",
    "we have used for the expectation values of coordinate operators the pure estimators following the methodology of ref .",
    "based on the future - walking strategy.@xcite as proved in pure @xmath1he,@xcite the pure estimator removes all the dependence on @xmath63 providing results as exact as the ones for the total energy .",
    "derivative operators as the kinetic energy can not be evaluated with the pure estimator , and the extrapolation methods generate more unreliable results than in the case of @xmath65 . in a pure phase it is not a severe problem because the kinetic energy can be calculated through the difference @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the pure estimation of the potential energy . that it is not obviously possible in the impurity system because the total energy includes the kinetic energy of the medium and the one of the @xmath0he impurity . to overcome this difficulty and",
    "go to an unbiased estimation of the @xmath0he kinetic energy one can invoke the hellmann - feynman theorem.@xcite it states that @xmath68 @xmath69 being the exact ground - state energy .",
    "we have then evaluated @xmath70 discretizing the derivative @xmath71 and computing the difference in the total energy ( with @xmath72% ) by means of the generalized reweighting method .",
    "the microscopic properties of a @xmath0he atom immersed in bulk @xmath1he have been investigated putting it in a simulation box with @xmath35 @xmath1he atoms in such a way that the volume is @xmath73 , with @xmath74 the input density . in all the simulations",
    "@xmath75 particles have been used and the time step and population bias have been analyzed in order to remove any systematic error .",
    "we have also verified that for @xmath76 the finite - system size introduces an error which is smaller than the statistical noise , indicating that the influence of the replicas of the @xmath0he impurity implied by the use of periodic boundary conditions is negligible .",
    "the interatomic interaction , which does not distinguish between the two isotopes , is the hfd - b(he ) aziz potential@xcite which has proved its high accuracy in a dmc calculation of the equation of state of superfluid @xmath1he at zero temperature.@xcite concerning the trial wave function ( [ jastrow ] ) , the two - body factor proposed in ref . with the parameters optimized for pure @xmath1he @xcite",
    "has been considered .",
    "we present the results of our calculations starting with a microscopic analysis of the local environment of the @xmath0he impurity in the medium .",
    "this information is mainly contained in the crossed two - body radial distribution function @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "1 , mixed ( short - dashed line ) and pure ( solid line ) estimations of @xmath51 at densities @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath80 ( @xmath81  ) are reported . in all the three densities",
    "the pure or exact results appear shifted to the right with respect to the mixed estimations pointing to a larger hole that is absolutely absent in the trial wave function . on the other hand ,",
    "the height of the main peak in the pure @xmath51 is slightly reduced at positive pressures and remains unchanged at the equilibrium density . in fig .",
    "2 , the evolution of @xmath51 with density is compared with the one shown by the pure @xmath1he distribution function @xmath82 .",
    "both functions show an increase of the localization when the density increases as well as a shift of the main peak to shorter interparticle distances . at a given density",
    ", the height of the main peak of @xmath51 is smaller than the one of @xmath82 and , what is more relevant , it appears localized to the right of the main peak of @xmath82 pointing manifestly to the existence of an excluded - volume region due to the smaller mass of the @xmath0he atom .",
    "the size of the excluded volume decreases when the density increases as one qualitatively can see comparing @xmath82 and @xmath51 at equilibrium and at the highest density plotted in fig .",
    "additional information on the local environment of the impurity is contained in the crossed static structure factor @xmath83 , @xmath84 which corresponds to the fourier transform of @xmath51 @xmath85 @xmath74 being the density of pure @xmath1he .",
    "from the above definition it is easy to check that the value of @xmath83 at the origin is@xcite @xmath86 with @xmath87 the quotient between the molar volume of the impurity system ( @xmath88 ) and that of pure @xmath1he ( @xmath89 ) . in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath83 is plotted in comparison with @xmath90 at the @xmath1he equilibrium density , @xmath91 being the pure @xmath1he static structure factor @xmath92    the function @xmath83 shown in the figure has been obtained fourier transforming @xmath51 for values @xmath93 @xmath94 and by a direct calculation of eq .",
    "( [ skai ] ) for @xmath95 @xmath94 . the main peak of @xmath83 appears slightly depressed with respect to the one of @xmath90 reflecting the same feature observed in the comparison of the radial distribution functions . nevertheless , the largest differences between the two static structure functions are at low @xmath96 values ( @xmath97 @xmath94 ) . in spite of the impossibility of calculating @xmath98 below a certain @xmath99 , imposed by the use of a finite - size simulation box and periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "if a linear extrapolation to @xmath100 is carried out one obtains @xmath101 and @xmath102 . if the latter is compared with eq .",
    "( [ sk0 ] ) , it results @xmath103 to be compared with the experimental value @xmath104.@xcite the volume - excess parameter @xmath105 decreases with pressure but this feature may be hardly observed in the limiting behaviour of @xmath83 at different densities ( fig .",
    "one of the most relevant magnitudes in the study of the impurity system is the binding energy of the @xmath0he atom in the medium or , otherwise , the chemical potential of the impurity @xmath7 . in table",
    "i , we report dmc results of the pure @xmath1he chemical potential @xmath45 and @xmath7 at three densities which correspond to the pressures also contained in the table .",
    "the results for the pressure and @xmath45 reproduce the experimental data with high accuracy as pointed out in refs . .",
    "also , in the present case , one gets a nice agreement between the calculated @xmath7 and the experimental data,@xcite the statistical uncertainties in the values of @xmath7 being less than 10 % . a more exhaustive comparison between theoretical and experimental values for @xmath7 is displayed in fig .",
    "5 . in the figure ,",
    "two additional results are plotted : one at a pressure higher than 20 atm , and another located at a density smaller than the equilibrium one ( @xmath106 ) which corresponds to a negative pressure of -6 atm .",
    "the solid line is a polynomial fit to the dmc results and has to be compared with the available experimental data of ref .",
    ", also reported in the figure .",
    "as one can see , the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent and a minimum in @xmath107 is not observed in this region .",
    "in fact , if a minimum exists it is located at lower densities , even below the spinodal density of @xmath1he ( @xmath108).@xcite it is worth noticing that @xmath0he energetically prefers to remain in the surface of liquid @xmath1he forming an andreev state rather than penetrate in the bulk.@xcite we have verified@xcite that if the @xmath0he impurity is replaced by a h@xmath109 molecule there is a minimum of @xmath7 at a density below @xmath106 that nearly coincides with the local density of the preferred location of h@xmath109 in @xmath1he clusters obtained in a dmc calculation of barnett and whaley.@xcite    in aca the chemical potential of the impurity is given by@xcite @xmath110 i. e. , it can be calculated from the knowledge of properties of the pure liquid .",
    "this approximation provides upper bounds ( see table i ) which , using dmc values for @xmath45 and @xmath111 , come close to the dmc and experimental values .    the volume - excess parameter @xmath105 may be obtained from the knowledge of @xmath107 , or equivalently @xmath112 , through the thermodynamic relation @xmath113 the values for @xmath105 so obtained are reported in table i in comparison with the experimental data of ref . .",
    "the agreement between @xmath105 and @xmath114 is very good at zero and intermediate pressures and even at high pressure where the error bar is somewhat larger .",
    "microscopic quantities which are also significant in the present study are the kinetic energy of the @xmath0he atom and the mean potential energy @xmath0he-@xmath1he ( @xmath115 ) . in table ii ,",
    "results for the kinetic and potential energies for the two helium isotopes are reported at several densities .",
    "all of them correspond to pure estimations .",
    "in both systems , pure liquid @xmath1he and liquid @xmath1he with one @xmath0he impurity , the potential energies may be obtained using the same method that has been used for the radial distribution functions because they are coordinate operators .",
    "the pure @xmath1he kinetic energy simply results from the difference @xmath116 but that is not the case for @xmath70 in the impurity system due to the coexistence of the two isotopes .",
    "therefore , the kinetic energy of the impurity has been calculated using the hellmann - feynman theorem as commented in sect .",
    "the aca estimation of the partial energies of the impurity is @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the values of @xmath119 being explicitly given in table ii to be compared with the exact results . in going from @xmath111 to @xmath70",
    "one can see that the largest change is due to the difference in the mass of the two isotopes , the only effect contained in @xmath120 , and the correction due to different correlations , i. e. , @xmath121 , is in all cases less than 10 % .",
    "this small correction is also observed by comparing @xmath122 and @xmath115 . in the range of densities here analyzed",
    ", it is observed that @xmath115 is always smaller than @xmath122 ( in absolute value ) whereas the difference @xmath123 is not monotonous : at @xmath124 , @xmath125 but @xmath126 at a density @xmath127 ( @xmath128 atm ) .",
    "this striking behaviour can be better understood looking at the differences between @xmath129 and @xmath51 at each density . in the region of positive and zero pressures",
    "the main peak of @xmath51 is ever shifted to the right with respect to the one of @xmath82 and with a smaller localization ( fig .",
    "the environment of the impurity may then be made _ equivalent _ to a pure @xmath1he liquid at a reduced density .",

    "6 , results for @xmath70 using different masses for the impurity are displayed in comparison with the aca prediction ( dashed line ) . for simplicity ,",

    "the results obtained show a good agreement with recent experimental data that slightly worsens at high pressure due probably to uncertainties in the mc extrapolation method used in the estimation of @xmath146 . a natural extension to the present work would be the calculation of the excitation energy of the @xmath0he impurity in liquid @xmath1he , which in the limit @xmath154 is given by @xmath155 , and",
    "therefore will provide another method to estimate the impurity effective mass .",
    "in such a calculation , one can use dmc combined with the fixed - node and released - node methods , that we have already employed in the study of the phonon - roton spectrum in superfluid @xmath1he.@xcite work in this direction is in progress .",
