    "[ tab : lj - tolman - empirical ] and the corresponding literature sources.@xcite this suggests that the first - order curvature correction increases the surface tension .",
    "it also suggests that this contribution is not very strong , and that it may be neglected except for very small droplets : based on this effect only , a droplet with a radius of @xmath164 ( i.e. , typically , @xmath165 to @xmath166  nm ) would have a surface tension which is 1% greater than that of the planar limit ( @xmath167 ) . for larger droplets ,",
    "the deviation from @xmath4 would be smaller than @xmath168 .",
    "tolman@xcite was aware of this , but he nonetheless proposed a truncation of the curvature expansion of @xmath1 after the first - order term .",
    "however , it is plausible that at this length scale , higher - order contributions to @xmath1 , e.g. , proportional to @xmath169 or @xmath170 , are already at least as significant as the first - order contribution.@xcite it is therefore important to take such terms into account ; otherwise it is impossible to assess whether @xmath25 holds in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "baidakov and bobrov@xcite and wilhelmsen  _ et al._@xcite advocate the use of the helfrich@xcite expansion , @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the bending rigidity and @xmath173 is the rigidity with respect to the gaussian surface curvature @xmath55 .",

    "( [ eqn : curvature - expansion ] ) , after the second - order term has been proposed on the basis of the hadwiger@xcite theorem which can be understood to imply the absence of a bending rigidity and of higher - order terms  @xcite @xmath174 however , results on the hard - sphere fluid indicate that at least at high packing fractions , this interpretation of the hadwiger theorem constitutes an oversimplification.@xcite",
    "care must be taken when concepts from macroscopic equilibrium thermodynamics are applied to small systems.@xcite this also holds for relations which are well established , such as the gibbs adsorption equation .",
    "it was discussed here how a deviation between the surface tension @xmath1 and the specific surface excess free energy @xmath105 affects this equation .",
    "a generalized gibbs adsorption equation was derived which takes these effects consistently into account .    on this basis , for expansions of the type @xmath175 , we have shown that the coefficient @xmath49 , which characterizes the influence of the surface curvature on the surface tension to first order in @xmath176 , can not be determined from the tolman length @xmath10 . as a consequence ,",
    "the leading - order coefficient can not be computed , e.g. , by molecular simulation , comparing the equimolar radius @xmath8 and the laplace radius @xmath9 .",
    "this does not imply that the only way to obtain @xmath49 is from an analysis of numerical data for @xmath27 .",
    "thermodynamic approaches can be employed to determine the coefficient from the compressibility of the fluid phases at equilibrium or from other related properties.@xcite    however , since recent findings indicate that @xmath49 is very small or zero , and that the contribution to @xmath1 which is proportional to @xmath176 is very small ( and could even be entirely absent ) , such approaches will probably fail to capture @xmath27 correctly .",
    "the challenge of developing rigorous thermodynamic approaches and simulation methods to quantify the higher - order curvature contributions to the surface tension of small bubbles and droplets therefore remains an important area of investigation .",
