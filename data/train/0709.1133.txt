    "we conclude that @xmath75 alone does not suffice in describing the mechanism of hydrophobic assembly .",

    "the diffusive trough in the free energy surface funnels into the deep basin associated with the aggregated dimer state .",
    "the difference in free energy between the minimum of the diffusive basin and the bottom of the aggregated basin is about @xmath94 . near the transition state ,",
    "fluctuations in @xmath87 are non - gaussian , and large fluctuations , especially towards larger values of @xmath87 are stabilized . in addiction ,",
    "the assembly of the hydrophobic nano - particles is an activationless process , as there is no appreciable barrier in the free energy surface . as a result , when the particles are separated by distance @xmath95 the solvent fluctuations required to create a vapor tunnel are of the order @xmath96 , the thermal energy of the system .",
    "the collapse probability distribution @xmath97 was computed for two points in the transition state region .",
    "we found that just as for the one - dimensional @xmath75 ( plotted in in fig .",
    "[ fig : icdenmap ] ) , the distribution of collapse probabilities are bimodal for both points in the transition state region for the two dimensional coordinate .",
    "this is a sign that a solvent coordinate with greater spatial resolution is required to characterize this transition .",
    "although @xmath87 is capable of distinguishing between panels a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : icdenmap ] , it does not reliably resolve a vapor tunnel in individual trajectories .",
    "this can be seen by comparing snapshots a and c in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajmech ] , which appear very different in their solvent configurations , but lie in almost identical regions of the two - dimensional phase space @xmath98 .            with the spatial resolution of @xmath99",
    "we observe a pronounced depletion of the solvent density between the solutes prior to the passing through of the transition bottleneck .",
    "the red points in figure [ fig : op3fe ] are members of the transition state ensemble , which are clustered near the transition bottleneck of the free energy surface .",
    "this figure , along with fig .",
    "[ fig : icdenmap ] provides us with a description of the aggregation .",
    "the transition begins when the particles have diffused to positions that bring their surrounding solute cavities to within the range accessible by equilibrium fluctuation of the cavity interface . as the interfaces surrounding each solute particle samples many configurations the cavities come into contact which creates the beginning of a vapor tunnel .",
    "the growth of the vapor tunnel is manifest on fig .",
    "[ fig : op3fe ] as the rapid decrease of the density , @xmath99 , between the solutes prior to passing through the bottle neck in the free energy surface .",
    "the existence of a vapor tunnel leads to an unbalancing of the solvent induced force on the solute particles .",
    "this unbalanced force arises because the solute particles are being pushed by solvent in every direction accept the direction of the vapor tunnel .",
    "the result is a net solvent induced force on each solute in the direction of the vapor tunnel .",
    "the particles are pushed closer together and are eventually squeezed into physical contact by the solvent .",
    "solvent dynamics were carried out along a markov chain , the details of which are provided in section [ sec : methods ] .",
    "one consequence of using single lattice site moves , is that the net solvent density is allowed to fluctuate in a fashion that does not account for solvent mass conservation . to examine the extent to which this conservation is important , we have generated trajectories with kawasaki@xcite neighbor exchange dynamics .",
    "these dynamics are carried out just like the metropolis dynamics described in section [ sec : methods ] , but instead of attempting changes of state for single lattice sites , the states of two neighboring lattice sites are exchanged . the acceptance probability , of course , is consistent with the boltzmann weight for the energy in eq .",
    "[ eq : latham ] . the free energy surface , an equilibrium property , is invariant to the choice of dynamics . those aspects of trajectories determined by statistics are unchanged .",
    "specifically , under both the mass - conserving and non mass - conserving dynamics , dimerization is preempted by the formation of a vapor tunnel which accelerates assembly . in both cases",
    "the onset of accelerated assembly occurs near @xmath104 .",
    "but the rate at which solutes are pushed together in this region are very different for the two forms of solvent dynamics . specifically , after passing through the transition state by forming a stable vapor tunnel , trajectories with the mass - conserving solvent dynamics take about 2000ps to dimerize , more than one order of magnitude slower than the dynamics without mass conservation .",
    "thus , although the mechanism of hydrophobic assembly is invariant to solvent mass conservation , the rate of passing through the transition state ensemble does depend upon conservation , so that prefactors to an arrhenius rate constant expression depend upon it significantly .",
    "the model considered in detail here contains idealized hydrophobic solutes who s only interactions with the solvent is to excluded it from occupying a specific volume . in real physical systems , there are additional solute - solvent interactions , such as van der waals attractions which can also play a role in the dynamics .",
    "recent work@xcite has described how the average solvent density surrounding hydrophobic solutes responds linearly to attractive solute - solvent forces .",
    "this response increases the mean density , and shifts the position of the surrounding interface closer to the solute surface . to the extent that solvent fluctuations are gaussian , the nature of the interfacial fluctuations are unchanged .",
    "thus , for fixed solute positions , the addition of such attractions necessarily increases the distance between the interfaces surrounding different solute particles . as a result",
    ", larger solvent fluctuations are required to form a vapor tunnel , leading to an increase in the activation energy to reach the transition state . a free energy barrier to the formation of a vapor tunnel that is more than a few @xmath96 , can be reduced ( and even avoided all together ) if the solutes diffuse closer together . thus , attractive forces that do not destroy the interface by pinning it to the solute surface ( in which case the solute could hardly be considered hydrophobic ) do not qualitatively change the mechanism discussed here .",
    "the effect of such attractions would , however , cause a decrease in the value of the distance @xmath84 , the distance at which the onset of dimerization is observed , in effect , small attractive forces make the solvated particles look smaller .",
