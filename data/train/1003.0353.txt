    "<S> different ways of addressing additional degrees of freedom in such ultra - cold bosonic gases have been suggested  @xcite .    in the present fast track communication </S>",

    "<S> we go beyond a weak coupling of energy bands and consider an isolated two - band system with a strong external force . </S>",
    "<S> a closed two - band system is an idealisation but can be realised approximatively with ultra - cold atoms  @xcite using different techniques as , e.g. , super lattices  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the bands are separated by a bandgap @xmath12 and have onsite - energies @xmath13 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we include hopping between neighbouring sites in band @xmath14 with a hopping strength @xmath15 , and a repulsive interaction between particles occupying the same site in band @xmath16 with a strength @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> all parameters are measured in recoil energies @xmath22 and we set @xmath23 troughout . </S>",
    "<S> focussing on a realisation with a single optical lattice rather than a superlattice , the relation between the parameters is generally : @xmath24 , as well as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we take the external force @xmath19 as a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the interaction strength can be tuned ( experimentally , e.g , by the use of feshbach resonances  @xcite ) and include a corresponding scaling factor @xmath27 to all interaction terms . to study the occupation of the upper band , we prepare the system in an initial state @xmath28 , with a uniform distribution of particles in the lower band only and evolve it in time by the many - body schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity we study is the ( normalised ) number of particles in the upper band @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total number of particles . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to @xmath31 as _ occupation of the upper band_.    let us discuss the non - interacting single - particle case @xmath32 first . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the following transformation involving bessel functions of the first kind @xmath33 to our operators , which is known to remove the hopping terms in the single - band case  @xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 . using relations for bessel functions , we arrive at @xmath37,\\ ] ] </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath38 and @xmath13 as above . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain coupling between any two sites of the two different bands , weighted by bessel functions . in the coupling between different and possibly remote sites </S>",
    "<S> originates from an on - site coupling and subsequent hoppings . </S>",
    "<S> it can thus be considered a higher order process in the original basis . </S>",
    "<S> but in the transformed hamiltonian  , this coupling is now direct with a strength modified by the factor @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space in the many - particle problem is spanned by fock states with fixed particle number @xmath40 with single - particle basis @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the total dimension of the fock space for a given number of atoms @xmath42 and lattice sites @xmath7 per band is given by @xmath43 $ ] . for numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we change to the interaction - picture with respect to the external force  @xcite which removes the tilt @xmath44 and replaces @xmath45 ( and likewise for @xmath46 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is then time - dependent with a periodicity of @xmath47 and decomposes into a direct sum of operators for specific quasi - momenta @xmath48  @xcite . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the size of the hilbert space is reduced by a factor of the order of @xmath7  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the different subspaces are physically equivalent , we restrain our discussion to the @xmath49-subspace of the hilbert space  @xcite . + for the time - evolution of a given initial state , we use either a direct numerical integration ( with an adaptive step - size runge - kutta algorithm  @xcite ) or an eigenbasis expansion after diagonalising the problem : @xmath50 here we use the eigenstates @xmath51 of the floquet - bloch operator ( @xmath52 denotes time - ordering ) @xmath53,\\ ] ] since the hamiltonian is explicitly time - dependent , with a periodicity @xmath54 . in addition , this gives us the full spectrum and enables access to relevant energy scales of the problem , as well as an identification of the most important states participating in the time - evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> _ results .  </S>",
    "<S> _ for the specific system under consideration , i.e. , bosons in optical lattices , both hopping coefficients @xmath55 are smaller than unity and ( since we are interested in strong inter - band coupling ) we take the external stark force @xmath19 to be much larger than the hopping coefficients : @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - interacting hamiltonian now allows for simple solutions for two regimes : values of the external force @xmath19 not leading to a degeneracy between energy levels of different bands ( _ off - resonant _ regime ) and values of the force @xmath19 leading to such a degeneracy ( _ resonant _ regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the off - resonant regime we make use of @xmath57 and neglect all bessel functions in except for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian then decomposes  @xcite into a sum of independent two - level systems and the occupation of the upper band when initially zero follows a simple rabi formula @xmath59^{-1}\\sin^2 ( \\tilde\\delta t/2)$ ] , where @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to rabi oscillations between the bands with an amplitude much smaller than unity and a period @xmath61 of the order of the _ bloch period _ @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> an example is shown in the lower panel of where the off - resonant contribution to the oscillations is shown .    </S>",
    "<S> although the coupling from a site @xmath6 to sites in the other band with different index @xmath63 is usually small ( cf . discussion after ) , it is important when the two levels become degenerate in energy , i.e. , for resonant values of the force @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when the energy gap between both bands is close to an integer multiple of the external force @xmath64 and we refer to this regime as _ resonant of order @xmath65_. in resonance , the coupling of the degenerate levels is most important and the hamiltonian of can similarly be reduced to a sum of independent two - level systems @xmath66,\\ ] ] and diagonalised by @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant oscillations ( of order @xmath65 ) between the two bands have an amplitude of almost unity and a period given by @xmath69 an example of these resonant oscillations for @xmath70 is shown as the thin dashed line in . the period predicted by the reduction to independent two - level systems </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath71 for the parameters given there , in excellent agreement with where the actual period is @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we found equally good agreement in numerical simulations for different lattice depths and other orders @xmath65 of resonance not explicitly reported here .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now study the effect of the many - body interaction in the original hamiltonian  </S>",
    "<S> . also shows the occupation of the upper band as a function of time for the initial state @xmath73 in a weakly interacting system with @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a decay of the resonant oscillations followed by a major revival . at later times </S>",
    "<S> several minor revivals occur ( not shown in ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is stable against variations of the system parameters ( as number of particles and lattice sites , even for fillings @xmath75 of order but not always close to one ) , with the time scales of decay and revival depending on the interaction strength @xmath27 ( see the following section and ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found the same phenomenon with different initial states in numerical simulations as long as the particles are mainly delocalised along the lattice and occupy only the lower band , i.e. , excluding fock states with all particles on one lattice site for instance .    </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory behaviour depicted in strongly reminds of the collapse and revival effect known from quantum optics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a specific feature in these systems is a linear dependence of the collapse and revival time on the inverse coupling strength , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath27 usually denotes the coupling strength between the light field and the two - level atom in the quantum optical systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we verified numerically for our system that the observed decay and revival times obey a similar dependence with the interaction parameter @xmath27 as coupling strength in our model . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath78 as the time when the difference between the maximal and average amplitude of the inter - band oscillations has fallen to @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath80 . the revival time is taken as the maximum of the revived oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> clearly demonstrates the linear dependence of these times on the inverse interaction strength .    to find an effective description , we try to understand the most relevant interaction processes </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the repulsive two - body interaction disfavours double occupancy of sites since this will always cost an interaction energy @xmath81 for two particles occupying the same site in the lower ( upper ) band . </S>",
    "<S> starting from an initial state with population of the ground band only , the strong stark force leads to an occupation of the upper band . </S>",
    "<S> doubly occupied sites are also suppressed there , but two particles may sit at the same site in either band , i.e.  on top of each other \" . indeed , the most important interaction term in the time - evolution is @xmath82 , since it already gives a non - zero contribution when there is only one particle per site in each of the two bands . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , comparing the time evolution of the initial state with all interaction terms and only the one mentioned shows almost no difference ( cf . ) . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on fillings close to unity @xmath83 and study the time - evolution of states of the form @xmath84 , which is not an eigenstate of the system in resonance . note </S>",
    "<S> that this is the most important contribution to the superfluid ground state in an expansion in our configuration state fock basis . for large enough systems the superfluid ground state of the untilted system ( and the single - occupancy state @xmath85 likewise ) becomes indistinguishable from a coherent state ( eq .  ( 66 ) in  @xcite ) that factorises into a product of local coherent states at each site @xmath6 : @xmath86 |{\\rm vac}\\rangle =       \\prod_l \\big ( \\rme^{\\sqrt{\\bar n } a_l^{{\\dagger } } } |{\\rm vac}\\rangle_l\\big ) =       \\prod_l |\\varphi ; 0\\rangle_l       \\equiv |\\boldsymbol \\varphi ; 0\\rangle.\\ ] ] we denote this coherent state with phase @xmath87 by @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> we are now going to re - write this state in the resonant basis and determine the effect of the interaction term @xmath89 when acting on this state . </S>",

    "<S> let us denote fock states with single - particle basis @xmath96 by round parentheses @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> from we see , that the coherent state of the lower band in resonance is a product of local coherent states for both bands in the resonance basis @xmath98 with @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the time - evolution of this state ( for the non - interacting system in resonance ) is simple since it is diagonal in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian in resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we continue to study the phase evolution created by the most important term @xmath89 perturbatively by expressing the operators @xmath100 in the @xmath101-basis : @xmath102 |\\boldsymbol{\\tilde\\varphi } ; -\\boldsymbol{\\tilde\\varphi } )        = \\exp\\bigg[\\frac{\\rmi gw_x t } { 2}\\sum_{l}\\sum_{l_1,\\ldots , l_4 } j_{l - l_1}(x_a)j_{l - l_2}(x_a)j_{l - l_3}(x_b ) \\times \\nonumber\\\\      j_{l - l_4}(x_b ) ( \\mu_{l_1}^{\\dagger } - \\nu_{l_1}^{\\dagger})(\\mu_{l_2 } - \\nu_{l_2})(\\mu_{l_3}^{\\dagger}+ \\nu_{l_3}^{\\dagger})(\\mu_{l_4 } + \\nu_{l_4})\\bigg ] |\\boldsymbol{\\tilde\\varphi } ; -\\boldsymbol{\\tilde\\varphi}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath103 is a product of local coherent states we can ignore the sum over @xmath6 and discuss the expected behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , both @xmath104 are much smaller than unity and the main contribution in the sums over @xmath105 will come from the zeroth - order bessel functions @xmath106 . secondly , the product of operators gives @xmath107 different combinations of the field operators . </S>",
    "<S> but due to the prefactors , the combinations with equal indices are the most important . </S>",
    "<S> they simply give an integer number when applied to the product of local coherent states they are acting on . taking these two points together , the time evolution of this state should show an approximate revival at @xmath108 this result is valid for large systems and can not account for the effect of non - universal properties like a limited number of particles and lattice sites , but we expect it to yield the right order of magnitude for finite systems , and in particular the correct scaling with the parameters of external potentials ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> , inset , below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> additional finite size corrections to can be understood by using the decomposition into the eigenbasis  . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the occupation of the upper band certainly depends on the initial state , which we can take into account by studying the weights @xmath109 of the initial state expanded in the eigenbasis . </S>",
    "<S> the result of a numerical diagonalisation for a system in resonance is depicted in , where the absolute values of the expansion coefficients with their corresponding quasi - energies are shown .    </S>",
    "<S> for vanishing two - body interaction strength @xmath110 , the quasi - energies from the states with different occupation numbers are degenerate as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference between neighbouring lines of constant quasi - energies corresponds to the time - scale of the resonant inter - band oscillations and follows from the diagonalisation of the resonant non - interacting system as @xmath111 . in the non - interacting system ( @xmath110 ) </S>",
    "<S> , two coefficients are dominating and the difference of the quasi - energies yields a single time - scale @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> when the interaction is turned on , the weight of states with many contributions from double- or higher occupancies of sites decrease significantly ( since they are energetically disfavoured ) and their quasi - energies are slightly shifted . </S>",
    "<S> but , surprisingly , only a limited number of additional coefficients @xmath109 contributes significantly in the eigenbasis expansion even for @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed collapse and revival signal is now determined by a few expansion coefficients that are much larger than the others . </S>",
    "<S> if we focus on the three largest coefficients , denoted as @xmath114 and sorted by their quasi - energies @xmath115 , we find that the latter are shifted by the interaction by different amounts . the differences between neighbouring quasi - energies , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( shown for the example @xmath118 in ) , lead to a beating between two oscillations with periods @xmath119 and the revival time will thus be given by @xmath120 this estimate requires a numerical diagonalisation but gives a clear physical interpretation to the revival time observed in a specific realisation with @xmath42 atoms on @xmath7 lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> thus , taking and together , we have an understanding of the general physical mechanism triggering the collapse and revival of the resonant two - band oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare our prediction for the revival time , and , to actual numerical simulations in .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that gives the right order of magnitude for the revival in a specific realisation , and , in particular , it shows the correct scaling behaviour with the depth of the optical lattice ( shown in the inset of ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , shows that the corrections for specific sizes of the system are well accounted for by , which only slightly underestimate the revival times by a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> this deviation could be corrected by including more than three participating states , extending in this manner the arguments which lead to . </S>",
    "<S> + in an experimental realisation , the shorter the collapse time @xmath78 the easier it could be observed , and for an estimate we make use of the fact  @xcite that the collapse time is proportional to the revival time @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the width of the distribution of coefficients @xmath109 necessary to expand the initial state in the eigenbasis . for the specific example of @xmath123 and @xmath124 </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath125 for the width of the distribution ( i.e. the @xmath126 couplings include just one or very few additional states as in the derivation of above ) , such that we estimate @xmath127 compared to @xmath128 found numerically .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we focused on realisations with ultra - cold atoms in a tilted periodic potential , and the observed effect can be manipulated by engineering the potential  @xcite or the two - body interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the revival time depends sensitively on parameters as the hopping strength and the external force close to the zeros of the bessel function in . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to already realised manipulations by time - dependent forces as predicted by  @xcite and realized in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of bloch oscillations over thousands of periods and a fine control on the two - body interaction have already been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the collapse and revival of resonant inter - band oscillations predicted here should be accessible in such state - of - the - art experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we finally remark that the collapse and revival phenomena discussed in this section have their origin ( cf . ) in the degradation ( due to interactions ) of single particle _ </S>",
    "<S> inter - band _ oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> so , even if there are analogies to the collapses and revivals observed in other experiments  @xcite , the collapse - revival oscillations reported there arise from the interaction within a single - band . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in contrast to our results , those oscillations would not at all occur when the lower band interaction is suppressed , equivalent to @xmath129 in the model here discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary .  </S>",
    "<S> _ we studied the coupling between two energy bands in a two - band bose  hubbard model with an additional tilting force . </S>",
    "<S> the force can lead to a strong coupling of the bands and we found strong resonances in the inter - band oscillations in this lattice model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the two - particle interaction leads to a collapse and revival of the resonant inter - band oscillations . here , we made predictions for the relevant time scales which were verified numerically . </S>",
    "<S> + a closed two - band system is an idealisation , but it can approximately be realised in various parameter regimes with ultra - cold atoms  @xcite using different techniques as e.g. super lattices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the use of feshbach resonances allows a complete control and fine tuning of the interaction strength  @xcite needed to test our predictions . </S>",
    "<S> our work is a first important step in going beyond ground - band physics and accessing more degrees of freedom in bosonic ultra - cold gases .    </S>",
