    "collective coordinates of a field theory soliton play a central role in the study of the soliton dynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "they represent the motion of the soliton as a whole in the symmetry directions of the original field theory .",
    "since the soliton breaks these symmetries , the collective coordinates are related with the zero - mode fluctuations around the soliton .",
    "the simplest way to construct the system of collective coordinates is to promote the ( originally constant ) free parameters of the static soliton associated with symmetries to time - dependent dynamical variables by discarding the fluctuation of non - zero modes .    as an example , let us consider the collective coordinate of space - translation of a static soliton @xmath2 in a scalar field theory in @xmath3 dimensions with lagrangian density @xmath4 . in the simple treatment ,",
    "we take @xmath5 as the soliton field with a dynamical variable of the center - of - mass @xmath6 . plugging this into the lagrangian density and carrying out the space integration",
    ", we get the following lagrangian of @xmath6 : @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the energy of the static soliton .",
    "somehow , we have obtained the _ non - relativistic _ lagrangian of a point particle with coordinate @xmath6 , although we started with a relativistic scalar field theory .",
    "we need an improved treatment of collective coordinates which leads to the relativistic lagrangian @xmath9 the purpose of this paper is to propose a simple and general principle of constructing the system of collective coordinates of a field theory soliton , by which we can obtain the complete and relativistic lagrangian of collective coordinates .",
    "first , let us state our principle of introducing the collective coordinates into a static soliton solution : _ collective coordinates must be introduced into the static solution in such a way that the equation of motion ( eom ) of the collective coordinates ensures that of the original field theory .",
    "_ we call this the `` eom principle '' hereafter .",
    "although the original field theory has an infinite number of degrees of freedom , the reduced system of collective coordinates has only a finite number of ones .",
    "therefore , even if the eom of collective coordinates holds , it does not necessarily imply that the field theory eom holds .",
    "our eom principle demands in a sense that there should be no mismatch between the field theory dynamics and the collective coordinate dynamics .",
    "if the original field theory is a relativistic one , our eom principle should automatically lead to a relativistic lagrangian of the collective coordinates .",
    "practically , the introduction of collective coordinates by the eom principle must be carried out in a self - consistent manner .",
    "starting with a suitably chosen dependence of the soliton field on the collective coordinates , we obtain the lagrangian and consequently the eom of the collective coordinates by plugging the soliton field into the field theory lagrangian .",
    "besides this , we plug the assumed soliton field into the field theory eom , and examine whether it holds under the eom of collective coordinates .",
    "we tune the dependence of the soliton field on the collective coordinates so that the eom principle is realized .    in the above example of the center - of - mass in a scalar field theory in @xmath3 dimensions ,",
    "the field theory eom is in fact broken by the term @xmath10 if we take as the soliton field ( see eq .  ) .",
    "let us apply our eom principle to this system to resolve the breaking of field theory eom successively in the number of time - derivatives .",
    "as an improved soliton field , we take @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants to be determined by the eom principle .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian of @xmath6 reads @xmath15 up to time - derivative terms .",
    "therefore , the eom of @xmath6 remains unchanged from that in the simple treatment : @xmath16 . on the other hand , for the field theory eom",
    ", we have @xmath17\\phi''_{\\text{cl}}(y ) , \\label{eom_x}\\ ] ] up to terms containing @xmath18 . from this , we find that the eom principle is satisfied ( up to @xmath19 ) by taking @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are nothing but the first three terms of the expansion in powers of @xmath24 of the lorentz boost @xmath25 and the relativistic lagrangian , respectively . , @xmath22 of obviously leads to the relativistic lagrangian to all orders in @xmath24 .",
    "however , for a generic @xmath6 , we have to add corrections of @xmath26 starting with @xmath27 for obtaining . ]    here , we should mention another and conventional way of constructing the system of collective coordinates",
    ". it is , starting with suitably introduced collective coordinates ( for example , for the center - of - mass ) , to integrate over the non - zero modes around the soliton .",
    "equivalently , we solve the eom of the non - zero modes to express them in terms of the collective coordinates .",
    "since the set of eoms of both the zero and non - zero modes are equivalent to the field theory eom , integration over the non - zero modes leads to a system of collective coordinates whose eom implies the field theory eom . in fact , the relativistic energy of the center - of - mass motion , @xmath28 , has been obtained by this method for a scalar field theory in @xmath3 dimensions @xcite .",
    "looking back the procedure of , and , the eom of the non - zero modes implies that they are equal to zero if we adopt the elaborated way of introducing the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath6 by using @xmath22 of .    in the case of the center - of - mass coordinate of a soliton , we know its relativistic lagrangian from the start . however , for the collective coordinate of the spinning motion of a soliton , it is quite a non - trivial problem to obtain its relativistic description , and this is our main concern of this paper .",
    "concretely , we consider the spinning collective coordinate of the skyrmion , which is a soliton representing a baryon in the low energy effective theory of pions ( the skyrme - model ) @xcite .",
    "let @xmath29 be the static skyrmion solution . in the simple treatment , we take @xmath30 as the spinning skyrmion field with the rotation matrix @xmath31 of spinning motion .",
    "this leads to the hamiltonian of a spinning spherical rigid body @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the energy of the static solution , moment of inertia , angular velocity in isospace ( body - fixed frame ) and the isospin operator , respectively .",
    "( @xmath37 also has an equivalent expression with @xmath35 and @xmath38 replaced with the angular velocity @xmath39 in real space and the spin operator @xmath40 , respectively . )",
    "however , this rigid body description is certainly a non - relativistic one valid only for a slow spinning motion . for a large angular velocity",
    ", the skyrmion should intuitively deform from its original spherical shape , and this should lead to corrections with higher powers of @xmath35 to the rigid body hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , it is an interesting theoretical subject to obtain relativistic ( i.e. , higher time - derivative ) corrections to the rigid body approximation , or , if possible , to find the fully relativistic description which is the spinning motion counterpart of .",
    "relativistic corrections to the rigid body approximation may be important also phenomenologically for the skyrmion describing baryons .",
    "identifying the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian with the masses of the nucleon ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , we find the followings : @xmath46 this implies that , ( i ) about @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) of the total mass of the nucleon ( @xmath43 ) comes from the rotational energy , and ( ii ) the rotational velocity of the nucleon ( @xmath43 ) at the radius of @xmath49 is @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ! ) of the light velocity .",
    "these facts suggest that relativistic corrections are non - negligible especially for @xmath43 , and that we should reexamine the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite based on the rigid body approximation by incorporating the effects of the corrections .",
    "the limitations of the rigid body approximation were shown numerically without relying on the expansion in powers of angular velocity in the case of the @xmath52-dimensional baby version of the skyrme theory @xcite .    in this paper , we derive the leading relativistic correction to the rigid body lagrangian of the spinning skyrmion by taking the eom principle as the basic principle of constructing the lagrangian of spinning collective coordinate .",
    "we follow the procedure starting with for the center - of - mass motion .",
    "namely , assuming the spinning skyrmion field of the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 , we determine the correction term from the eom principle . note that the relativistic correction to @xmath55 is made only to the argument of the static solution . in the case of the center - of - mass motion ,",
    "the first relativistic correction is specified by the constant coefficient @xmath13 . for the spinning skyrmion",
    ", we have to determine three functions @xmath56 of the radial coordinate @xmath57 appearing in @xmath58 ( see eq .  ) by solving their differential equations derived from the eom principle .",
    "then , from @xmath56 , the @xmath59 correction term to the rigid body lagrangian is obtained ( see eq .  ) . from the function @xmath58",
    ", we can also learn how the static skyrmion of spherical shape deforms due to the spinning motion .",
    "then , we repeat the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite for the decay constant @xmath60 and various static properties of nucleons , such as charge radii , magnetic moments and axial vector coupling , by including the relativistic corrections .",
    "we find that the contribution of the relativistic corrections is in the range of @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "however , the comparison with the experimental data is a rather disappointing one : although the value of @xmath60 is shifted closer to the experimental one due to the relativistic correction , it makes the theoretical value move away from the experimental one for most of the static properties .",
    "however , this should not be regarded as a problem of our eom principle .",
    "either higher order relativistic corrections are important , or we can not expect the skyrme model to reproduce the baryon sector so precisely .    as we mentioned before",
    ", there is another way of constructing the system of collective coordinates .",
    "this is , starting with a simply introduced collective coordinates ( such as in the rigid body approximation ) , to solve the eom of the massive modes to express them in terms of the collective coordinates .",
    "though there has appeared no explicit analysis of the spinning skyrmion by this method , the present one using the eom principle should have some advantages : firstly , ours is simpler since we are not bothered by the non - zero modes , and secondly we can directly know how the soliton deforms due to its fast spinning motion since the collective coordinates are introduced by deforming the coordinate of the static solution .",
    "we should mention that there have appeared many attempts to improve the rigid body approximation of @xcite .",
    "they include the papers @xcite .",
    "we wish to emphasize that our method based on the eom principle gives a systematic and self - consistent way of analyzing the spinning motion of a field theory soliton without any ad hoc physical pictures .    finally , we remark that the eom principle has already been used for solitons in gauge theories even in the `` rigid body approximation '' before introducing the relativistic corrections .",
    "namely , the dependence of the gauge field on the collective coordinates must be determined from the eom of @xmath61 , the gauss law , which is non - trivial even in the rigid body approximation .",
    "the examples are the magnetic monopoles in gauge - higgs systems ( see @xcite for a review ) and the baryon solution @xcite in the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite .",
