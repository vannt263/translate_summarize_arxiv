    "polar systems , a subgroup of magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) , contain a highly magnetized white dwarf with polar field strengths ranging from @xmath0 10 mg @xmath0 to 230 mg ( see beuermann 1997 and references therein ) , and accreting material from a late type main sequence star .",
    "the magnetic field of the white dwarf is strong enough to phase  lock its rotation with the orbital period .",
    "these systems are strong x - ray emitters in both soft and hard x - ray bands ( see review by cropper 1990 ) .",
    "while hard x - rays are emitted from a standing shock above the white dwarf surface , soft x - rays originate from hot photospheric regions heated either by irradiation from the post - shock plasma ( lamb & masters 1979 ) or by dense plasma blobs carrying their kinetic energy deep into the atmosphere ( kuipers & pringle 1982 ) .",
    "irradiation is important primarily for flow rates sufficiently low for the shock to stand high above the surface .",
    "however , a large fraction of the reprocessed radiation appears in the uv rather than at soft x - rays , as shown quantitatively in the case of amher ( gnsicke et al .",
    "the `` blobby '' accretion mode is increasingly important at higher field strengths , because the blobs become more and more compressed when arriving at the surface of the white dwarf ( e.g. beuermann & burwitz 1995 ; king 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "while the soft x  ray component is in general adequately fitted by a black  body spectrum with a temperature of a few tens of ev ( even if more sophisticated models are sometimes needed : see e.g. van teeseling et al .",
    "1994 ) , it has recently become clear that a simple thermal plasma model is no longer adequate in reproducing the hard x  ray component of polars . reflection from the white dwarf surface , complex absorption and multi  temperature emission may contribute significantly to the spectrum above a few tenth of kev ( e.g. cropper et al .",

    "1983 ) , exosat ( beuermann & schwope 1989 , hereafter b&s89 ) and rosat ( ramsay et al . 1996 ; schwope et al .",
    "in particular , the heao-1 and exosat observations showed that copious soft x - ray emission originates from the secondary pole in states of high accretion rate , while the exosat observations showed this pole to become increasingly less active at lower accretion rates .",
    "this suggests a picture in which the source switches from one to two  pole accretion in going from low to high states ( b&s89 ) .",

    "ray emission is best reproduced by a 17 ev blackbody ( szkody et al .",

    "despite all the above observations , the hard x  ray spectrum of bl hyi was still poorly known before the launch of asca and bepposax satellites .",

    "the asca satellite ( tanaka et al . 1994 ) contains two ccd s ( sis0 and sis1 ) and two gspc s ( gis2 and gis3 ) .",
    "sis s have a broader energy range ( 0.510 kev ) and better spectral resolution ( @xmath0150 ev , roughly constant with energy ) , while gis s have a narrower band ( 0.810 kev ) , poorer energy resolution ( about 500 ev at 6 kev ) but higher sensitivity above a few kev .",
    "the asca observation , carried out on 1994 oct 11/12 , was retrieved from the public archive ( preliminary results on this observation were presented by fujimoto & ishida 1995 ) . the log of the asca observation can be found in table 1 .",
    "the observation was performed in a mixture of 1-ccd and 2-ccd modes for the siss . after cleaning , and selecting bright2 mode for the siss , the effective exposure time reduced to about 42 , 41 , 43 and 43 ksec for sis0 , sis1 , gis2 and gis3 , respectively .",
    "data analysis was performed using the xanadu and ftools packages available from nasa goddard heasarc .",
    "images , light curves and spectra were created using xselect .",
    "spectral fitting and temporal analysis were performed with xspec and xronos , respectively .",
    "gis and sis spectra and light curves have been extracted within a circular region of radius equal to 6 ( gis2 and gis3 ) , 4 ( sis0 ) and 3 ( sis1 ) centred on the source .    for the giss , background levels have been estimated in an annulus centred on the source with inner radius of 6 and outer radius of 12. for the siss , the entire chip containing the source was used , after excluding a circle of 4.5 centred on the source .",
    "the adopted response matrices are those released on march 1995 for the gis , while for the siss they have been created with the routine sisrmg in the ftools3.6.0 environment , adopting the march 1997 cti calibration file .",
    "bepposax ( see boella et al .",
    "1997 for an overall description of the mission ) carries both narrow and wide field instruments .",
    "two wide field cameras point to opposite directions to each other , and perpendicularly to four co - aligned narrow field instruments : two imaging instruments , the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) and the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) ; and two collimated high  energy instruments , the phoswich detector system ( pds ) and the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) .    the mecs is actually composed of three units , working in the 110 kev energy range , with a total effective area of @xmath0150 @xmath3 at 6 kev .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath08% and the angular resolution is @xmath00.7  arcmin ( fwhm ) at 6  kev .",
    "the lecs has characteristics similar to that of a single mecs unit in the overlapping band , but its energy band extends down to 0.1 kev .",
    "bepposax observed the source on 1996 sep 27 .",
    "the effective exposure time for the mecs was 12.5 ksec , but unfortunately , due to instrument problems , only 3.7 ksec of lecs data were collected .",
    "the source was not detected by the hpgspc and the pds .",
    "the log of the bepposax observation can be found in table 1 .",

    "pi relationship .",
    "( in the following , with the name mecs we denote the sum of the three units . )",
    "we selected data acquired with an angle higher than 5@xmath6 with respect to the earth limb .",
    "the background subtraction was performed using blank sky spectra extracted from the same region of the detector field of view .",
    "the spectra were fitted using the calibration matrices released on september 1997 .",
    "we first searched for periodicity in both gis and sis light curves .",
    "a peak , consistent with the optical period ( but with a large error ) , was found ; we then used in the analysis the optical ephemeris of schwope ( private communication to szkody et al .",
    "1997 ) , even if it may no longer be fully appropriate ( schwope , private communication ) :",
    "@xmath7    the corresponding folded light curves for the gis2 and sis1 are shown in fig .  [ lc ] ( first and second panels from the top , respectively ) .",
    "the two curves are rather similar , despite the sis broader and softer energy band . comparing the curves with that of b&s89 ( fourth panel ) , obtained with the exosat",
    " me ( i.e. in a similar energy band ) in october 1985 , when the source was at a flux level more than a factor 2 lower ( see below ) , a rough agreement is found , but the maximum seems to start at a somewhat earlier phase in the asca curves . whether this difference is due to an intrinsic difference in the accretion pattern or to the ephemeris being no longer entirely appropriate is impossible to say until a new improved ephemeris will be available . during the minimum",
    ", the source is at a level much higher than the background , implying significant emission from the second pole .",
    "a hardness ratio analysis was also performed for the sis in order to search for spectral variations along the period .",
    "no significant variations were observed , and in the spectral analysis ( see section 4.1 ) we therefore used phase  averaged spectra .      in fig .  [ mecs_lc ] and in the third panel of fig .",
    "[ lc ] we show the mecs total and folded light curves , respectively .",
    "the folded light curve is incomplete due to the short observing time .",
    "the onset is covered , however , and the curve looks similar to the asca light curve .    as in the asca light curve , there is significant emission outside the bright phase .",
    "it is also important to note that the minimum flux varies considerably between individual orbits ( fig .",
    "the bepposax observation spanned about three cycles : in the first and third the countrate is always well above the background , while in the second cycle the flux drops down to zero and then starts rising , but remaining well below the corresponding level in the other two cycles .",
    "the accretion on the second pole is therefore clearly variable , both from cycle to cycle and within each minimum .",
    "as no spectral variations along the period are observed ( see section 3.1 ) , we used phase  averaged spectra . to perform the spectral analysis , we summed together the two siss and the two giss spectra , after having verified that the spectra of the single detectors were consistent with each other .",
    "as said above ( sec .",
    "3.1 ) , no significant variations of the hardness ratio along the phase is observed ( possibly due to the limited statistics in the low phase ) and we then used phase  averaged spectra ( which are , of course , dominated by the emission at the high phase ) .",
    "the resulting spectra were grouped to have at least 20 counts per bin , in order to apply the @xmath8 statistics . as the resulting sis and gis spectra were , in the overlapping band , consistent with each other , we fitted them simultaneously to improve the statistical quality of the fits , keeping the two normalizations different to account for possible remaining miscalibration between sis and gis .",
    "the results of the fits are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the fit with an optically thin isothermal plasma model ( i.e. mekal model in xspec_9.00 ; model 1 in table 2 ) is formally acceptable ; it gives a temperature of @xmath030 kev and a rather high value of the metal ( essentially iron ) abundance ( @xmath02.9 the solar one ) .",
    "the 210 kev averaged flux in the gis2 is 8@xmath410@xmath5 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 .    inspection of the residuals ( fig .",
    "[ ascasp ] ) indicates the presence of features , probably due to absorption , at low energies ( see below ) .",
    "also , the model does not reproduce adequately the iron line complex . adding a gaussian line at @xmath06.7 kev , i.e. from he  like iron , a significant improvement",
    "is obtained , with a line ew of about 350 ev : this strongly suggests that the real temperature is lower than estimated by the fit .",
    "furthermore , fitting the spectra in a restricted range with the upper energy fixed to 10 kev and the lower energy increasing from 1 to 6 kev , both the temperature and the abundance monotonically decrease , going from 22 kev and 2.7 to 10.7 kev and 0.7 , respectively , again suggesting the presence of further components in the spectrum as the reason for the high temperature and abundance found .    to investigate the origin of the observed low energy features in the residuals , we first added a full cold absorber .",
    "the quality of the fit increases significantly , and the plasma temperature reduces to @xmath014 kev , a value more in line with the common value for polars ( e.g. ishida 1991 ; done et al .",
    "1995 ; beardmore et al . 1995",
    "; ishida et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the fit , however , is still unsatisfactory because the value of the column density , 8@xmath410@xmath11 @xmath9 , is largely in excess of that determined by euve and rosat ( @xmath1210@xmath13 @xmath9 : szkody et al .",
    "1997 , ramsay et al .",
    "we then fitted a partial covering model , in analogy with other sources , in particular intermediate polars ( ishida 1991 ) .",
    "the fit ( model 2 ) is , from a statistical point of view , somewhat better than that with the full absorber ; the absorbing column is about 3@xmath410@xmath14 @xmath9 , and the covering factor is @xmath00.4 .",
    "fitting the spectra with more complex absorbers , like that discussed by done & magdziarz ( 1997 ) , does not improve significantly the quality of the fit .    even if the partial absorber is able to cure the low energy features in the residuals and to",
    "significantly reduces the temperature , the abundance remains rather large ( about 1.7 ) .",
    "such a high value has never been observed in this type of sources and it will require a very specific evolution of the system .",
    "we then investigated whether the high abundance could be an artifact of adopting a single  temperature model instead of a multi  temperature plasma expected since a temperature gradient along the emitting region is obtained from most models ( e.g. aizu 1973 ; wu et al .",
    "1994 ; woelk & beuermann 1996 ) .",
    "the fit with the cemekl multi  temperature model , however , is worse than that with an isothermal plasma and will not be considered further .",
    "we then included in the model the so  called compton reflection component ( lightman & white 1988 ; matt et al .",
    "1991 ; van teeseling et al .",
    "1996 ) in order to account for reflection of the hard radiation by the white dwarf surface .",
    "the presence of this component was suggested by done et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and beardmore et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for ef eri and am her , and it is now recognized to be an important ingredient of the x  ray spectrum of magnetic cvs .",
    "we adopted the model described in done et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , assuming the matter to be neutral ( van teeseling et al . 1996 ) and a mean inclination angle of 60@xmath6 . as the reflection continuum",
    "is always expected to be accompanied by a fluorescent iron line at 6.4 kev ( e.g. matt et al .",
    "1991 ) , we added also this feature .",
    "as shown in table 2 ( model 3 ) , an improvement in the fit is obtained , and the abundance is now close to one . the best fit value for @xmath15 ( i.e. @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the total and primary flux , respectively , and @xmath19 is the albedo of the reflecting matter ) is rather high ( @xmath02.5 ) , while a value about unity is expected for 2@xmath20 illuminated matter ; this could be due to the fact that a two  phase plane ",
    "parallel geometry is a too simple picture .",
    "there is also a mismatch between the amount of reflection continuum and the ew of the 6.4 kev iron fluorescent line : for the latter quantity , a value of about 90(@xmath21 ) ev , obtained assuming a @xmath010 kev illuminating spectrum , solar abundances and a mean observing angle of 60@xmath6 is in fact expected , to be compared with an observed 90% upper limit of 70 ev .",
    "this may suggest the presence in the spectrum of complexities too subtle to be explored with the present data .",
    "we also searched for sulphur lines at @xmath02.5 kev ; contrary to the claim of fujimoto & ishida ( 1995 ) , based on the very same data , we found no evidence for these lines .",
    "note that the sis calibration matrices have been quite improved since the time of their analysis , which may explain the difference .    in summary",
    ", there is clear evidence for complex absorption : a partial covering model provides an adequate description of the data , even if more complex absorbers can not be excluded .",
    "the continuum is well described by a single temperature plasma model ( but , again , multi  temperature components can not be rejected by the data ) , but in order to reduce the metal abundance to  normal \" values , a reflection component is needed , similarly to the case of other polars .",

    "1997 ) . to be conservative",
    ", we put the black  body component behind the cold partial screener ( model 3 in table 2 ) .",
    "the combined lecs+mecs fit gives no black  body flux ; the 90% upper limit to this component implies a bolometric soft luminosity less than about 10 times that of the hard one . a much more stringent limit ( i.e. @xmath45 )",
    "can be put if a 25 ev black  body temperature , as suggested by the rosat data ( ramsay et al .",
    "1996 ) , in instead adopted .",
    "during the asca and bepposax observations the source was significantly brighter than during the ` intermediate state ' of october 1985 , when it was observed by exosat ( b&s89 ) . assuming a 10 kev thermal plasma spectrum , the 210 kev phase  averaged flux , estimated with the pimms package , was in fact @xmath03@xmath410@xmath5 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 during that exosat observation , while it was @xmath02.3 and 2.7 times brighter during the bepposax and asca observations , respectively .",
    "the asca flux is in turn slightly lower than that measured by ariel v ( @xmath010@xmath46 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 , agrawal et al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "comparing both asca and bepposax folded light curves with the exosat ones ( and in particular with that of october 1985 , for which the statistics were the best ) , one important difference is apparent : there is significant emission from the second pole , while this emission during the exosat observation was less intense , even if still present . as",
    "clearly evident from the bepposax light curve , the emission from the second pole is highly variable , changing from cycle to cycle , and then suggesting non  stationary accretion .",
    "the asca and bepposax hard x  ray spectra are the first of sufficient quality to reveal spectral complexities .",
    "a simple thermal plasma model , even if formally acceptable , is unsatisfactory due to both the presence of features ( mostly at the lowest energies ) in the residuals and the high temperature and metal ( mainly iron ) abundance obtained",
    ". the inclusion of complex absorption cures the low energy features .",
    "a partial covering model , with a column density of about 3@xmath410@xmath14 @xmath9 and a covering fraction of @xmath00.4 provides an acceptable description of the spectrum .",
    "it is conceivable that the absorber in front of the hard x - ray component is the free - falling matter feeding the accretion spot .",
    "for example in v834 cen , this material was identified by its zeeman component shifted in wavelength as expected from the free - fall velocity ( schwope & beuermann 1990 ) .",
    "as the hard x - ray emitting post - shock plasma is probably located in front of the soft x - ray emitting sections of the photosphere , this absorbing material should affect the soft component as well .",
    "due to substantial pre - ionization , however , it may be partially transparent to soft x - rays . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that zeeman absorption from this material was seen in v834 cen indicates that in that system neutral material is also present .",
    "hence , the soft component may not emerge unhindered and its spectral properties may carry the signatures of the intervening absorber as well as those of the emitter .",
    "this has been taken into account when we have estimated the intensity of the soft component from the bepposax data .",
    "the upper limit so obtained is about ten times that of the hard luminosity , if a black  body temperature of 17 ev ( szkody et al . 1997 ) is assumed ; if , instead , a temperature of 25 ev ( ramsay et al .",
    "1995 ) is adopted the upper limit is much more tight , reducing to about the hard luminosity .",
    "we also computed the upper limit to the black  body to hot plasma flux ratio in the 0.12.4 kev , to make comparison with the theoretical expectation ( see fig .  8 in beuermann 1997 ) .",
    "the limits are 5 and 1.3 for the adopted black  body temperatures , consistent with the comparatively hard x - ray spectra encountered in low - field systems ( beuermann & schwope 1994 ) .",
    "this is especially true if the field strength of 12 mg measured by schwope et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is characteristic of the main accreting pole .",
    "even a field strength of 23 mg reported by ferrario et al .",
    "( 1996 ) would still qualify bl hyi as a low - field system , characterized by a strong hard x - ray component . only at still higher field strengths",
    "is bremsstrahlung effectively suppressed by increasing cyclotron cooling ( woelk & beuermann 1996 , see also beuermann 1997 ) .",
    "finally , the inclusion in the spectral model of the reflection component from the white dwarf surface provides a significant improvement in the statistical quality of the fit and reduces the abundance to roughly the solar value .",
    "this component has been already detected in a number of polars ( e.g. done et al .",
    "1995 ; beardmore et al . 1995",
    "; ishida et al . 1997 ; cropper et al . 1997 ; done & magdziarz 1997 ) and is now recognized as an important ingredient of their x  ray spectrum . with all these components included , the best fit post  shock temperature results to be about 10 kev ( with about 20% uncertainty ) in both observations , consistent with the exosat results ( b&s89 ) for the same source and with the values usually found in polars .",
