    "pierre curie  @xcite was the first to predict the interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity .",
    "the macroscopic symmetry consideration of the magnetoelectric ( me ) effect was given by dzyaloshinskii only in 1959  @xcite , whereas experimentally it was discovered by astrov in cr@xmath2o@xmath1 in 1960  @xcite .",
    "in the last decade whole new classes of magnetoelectric materials were discovered and experimentally studied ( for a recent review see , for example , @xcite ) .    despite a long history of me",
    "effect its microscopic origin is still a subject of debate .",
    "the fact that ferroelectricity commonly occurs in incommensurately modulated magnetically ordered phases predominates the assumption and consideration of various complex types of magnetic order such as screw , cycloidal , helix and others in most of the microscopic models of magnetoelectricity  @xcite . from the macroscopic crystal symmetry point of view the close connection between the appearance of modulated and ferroelectric phases in magnetoelectrics was recently pointed out  @xcite . whereas electric polarization indeed often occurs concurrently with complex modulated spin structures it",
    "can also be induced by commensurate magnetic order ( such is the case , for example , in some rare - earth manganates rmn@xmath2o@xmath3  @xcite ) .",
    "currently two models of me coupling are widely accepted in literature . in the model by sergienko et al .",
    "@xcite electric polarization @xmath4 $ ] is induced by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction between two magnetic ions @xmath5 and @xmath6 with superexchange . in the spin current model by katsura et al .",
    "@xcite the electric polarization is due to the spin supercurrent @xmath7 $ ] with @xmath8 being the unit vector connecting the sites @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "interpretation of the experimentally observed polarization using these models meets difficulties though and was a subject of critique  @xcite .",
    "it was argued  @xcite that the dm coupling  @xcite is 2 orders of magnitude weaker than what is needed to explain experimental situation in magnetoelectric manganites . on the other hand in the spin current model",
    "@xcite the authors also overestimated up to 2 orders of magnitude the value of the magnetically induced polarization  @xcite .",
    "several other mechanisms of the me effect were proposed  @xcite but as argued by the authors themselves they are insufficient to explain magnetoelectricity in some cu@xmath10 magnetoelectrics .    from our point of view",
    "most of the microscopic models proposed so far do not take into account the macroscopic crystal symmetry mainly focusing on three - site clusters ( two metal ions and oxygen ) and considering various spiral magnetic structures .",
    "the authors of the dm model of me effect  @xcite , for example , apply it to the case of rare - earth manganites rmno@xmath1 , whereas it can be shown that the macroscopic polarization vanishes when one considers the orthorhombic symmetry of the unit cell .",
    "indeed , the authors take tbmno@xmath1 as an example using the spiral magnetic structure available from neutron diffraction data .",
    "they consider the polarization induced in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 chains of mn - o - mn , but erroneously take into account only the @xmath13 plane . indeed , when one considers also the @xmath14 plane ( obtained from the first one by @xmath15 ) the macroscopic polarization cancels out .",
    "the aim of any me model is to find the mechanism of inversion symmetry breaking by magnetic order . at the same time",
    "some authors explicitly start with a centrosymmetric cluster such as , for example , in the spin current  @xcite or the meo@xmath16 cluster model  @xcite .",
    "this dismisses the fact that in many magnetoelectrics some types of ions are located in noncentrosymmetric surroundings already in the paramagnetic phase . in this work using mnwo@xmath0 as an example we suggest a microscopic magnetoelectric coupling model taking into account macroscopic symmetry of the unit cell and noncentrosymmetric surrounding of the mn@xmath10 ions .",
    "we then apply our microscopic model to estimate the linear magnetoelectric coefficients in mnps@xmath1 and linipo@xmath0 and discuss its application to other magnetoelectrics .",
    "wolframite mnwo@xmath0 possesses a monoclinic structure at room temperature ( figure  [ fig : mwostructure_and_cluster]a ) described by the space group @xmath17 ( c@xmath18 ) . on lowering the temperature it undergoes a sequence of magnetic phase transitions at 13.5  k ( t@xmath19 ) , 12.7  k ( t@xmath2 ) and 7.6  k ( t@xmath20 ) , leading to the appearance of magnetically ordered states * af3 * , * af2 * and * af1 *  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the low temperature phase * af1 * is characterized by the wave vector @xmath21 , whereas the incommensurate phases * af2 * and * af3 * by @xmath22 .",
    "electric polarization in mnwo@xmath0 appears in the * af2 * phase along the crystal @xmath23 axis  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological model of phase transitions in wolframite was suggested earlier based on the assumption that the magnetic order is driven by the instability in the @xmath24 point of the brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "however , for our purpose of building a microscopic model of the me effect we first start with a hypothetical magnetic order with @xmath25 in mnwo@xmath0 ( i. e. without multiplication of the unit cell ) and then consider the real magnetic structure .",
    "( a ) the monoclinic unit cell of mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "mn@xmath10 , w@xmath26 and o@xmath27 ions are shown by black , dark gray and light gray circles , respectively .",
    "( b ) the mn@xmath10 cluster showing distorted oxygen octahedron . the rotational c@xmath2 symmetry axis is indicated . ]",
    "mnwo@xmath0 contains two magnetic mn@xmath10 ions mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath2 in the unit cell located at positions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . in the following",
    "we define the orthogonal @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath30 axes parallel to the @xmath31 axis , parallel to the @xmath23 axis and perpendicular to both the @xmath31 and @xmath23 axes of the monoclinic cell , respectively . for the description of the magnetic order with @xmath25 we can introduce ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the magnetic moments of mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath2 .",
    "table  [ tab : gm - irs ] summarizes the irreducible representations ( ir ) possessed by the @xmath17 space group in the center of the brillouin zone and shows how the components of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and electric polarization @xmath38 transform according to the symmetry operations of the group .",
    "@llll ir & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & order parameters + gm@xmath41 &  1 &  1 & @xmath42 + gm@xmath43 &  1 & -1 & @xmath44 , @xmath45 + gm@xmath10 & -1 &  1 & @xmath46 , @xmath47 + gm@xmath27 & -1 & -1 & @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 +    as evident from the table the following magnetoelectric interactions are allowed by the macroscopic symmetry @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus any combination of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering produces electric polarization .",
    "the polarization also arises in case when only one of the mn@xmath10 moments orders ( e. g. when @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which corresponds to @xmath57 ) .",
    "such collinear commensurate magnetic ordering gives no polarization according to any of the microscopic models proposed so far , since they are usually concentrated on noncollinear modulated magnetic structures .",
    "nevertheless , from the crystal symmetry point of view such magnetic order breaks the crystallographic equivalency of mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath2 atoms , which are connected by inversion ( i.  e. breaks inversion symmetry ) and electric polarization arises .    in order to build a valid microscopic model of me interaction",
    "we proceed with the following consideration .",
    "first we note that the mn@xmath10 ions in mnwo@xmath0 are located in noncentrosymmetric positions .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that @xmath40 interchanges mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath2 or by direct examination of oxygen positions around mn@xmath10 ions  @xcite . since @xmath39 transforms each mn@xmath10 ion into itself",
    "their local crystal symmetry is c@xmath2 as depicted in figure  [ fig : mwostructure_and_cluster]b .",
    "thus the manganese ions are located in polar surroundings and all their electron s orbitals have electric dipole moment along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "every monoclinic cell has two mn@xmath10 ions with opposite dipole moments , thus , preserving zero dipole moment of the unit cell as schematically shown in figure  [ fig : boxion]a .",
    "( a ) two mn@xmath10 ions in the monoclinic unit cell with opposing electric dipole moments ( gray arrows ) .",
    "( b ) an ion ( black circle ) in c@xmath2 crystal field ( indicated ) possessing dipole moment @xmath58 ( gray arrow ) .",
    "( c ) same as ( b ) but taking the spin degree of freedom into account .",
    "a spin @xmath59 ( white arrow ) deviating from the c@xmath2 axis breaks the rotational symmetry and changes the electric dipole moment to @xmath60 deflecting it from the initial symmetry axis .",
    "( d ) two mn@xmath10 ions in the monoclinic unit cell with spin dependent electric dipole moments @xmath61 and @xmath62 resulting in nonzero total dipole moment of the unit cell @xmath63 . ]    figure  [ fig : boxion]b shows an ion in polar crystal environment ( local symmetry c@xmath2 ) .",
    "all electron orbitals possess , therefore , an electric dipole moment .",
    "if one takes the spin degree of freedom into account then the spin - orbit coupling alters the electric dipole moment .",
    "when the spin directs away from the two - fold rotational axis it breaks the rotational symmetry resulting in modification of the dipole moment as schematically shown in figure  [ fig : boxion]c .",
    "we now proceed from this simple physics consideration to semiquantitative quantum mechanical treatment .",
    "the manganese ions in mnwo@xmath0 are located in distorted oxygen octahedra as shown in figure  [ fig : mwostructure_and_cluster]b .",
    "therefore we start with a mn@xmath10 ion in octahedral crystal field and for simplicity consider only the @xmath64 orbitals .",
    "inclusion of @xmath65 levels is straightforward .",
    "thus as a zeroth order perturbation we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 or @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the hamiltonian including octahedral splitting field and @xmath70 is the @xmath64 energy level .",
    "next , we include as perturbation the monoclinic crystal field of c@xmath2 symmetry assuming the polar axis along the @xmath30 axis @xmath71 and spin - orbit coupling @xmath72 here @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are coefficients , @xmath77 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath59 is the spin and @xmath78 is the spin - orbit coupling constant .",
    "thus , the perturbed hamiltonian has the form @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "the perturbation @xmath81 mixes the unperturbed @xmath82 @xmath64 states with other states and for simplicity it is sufficient to consider only the @xmath83 states @xmath84 with the energy @xmath85 , @xmath54 .",
    "the two - fold degeneracy is removed in the first order and one can write for one of the perturbed eigenvectors @xmath86 are coefficients and @xmath87 is an eigenvector from the subspace spanned by @xmath88 .",
    "the electric dipole moment is given then by @xmath89 assuming @xmath90 we obtain in the first order of perturbation the @xmath30-component of the electric dipole moment induced by the local crystal field @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 . due to local c@xmath2 crystal field symmetry @xmath94 .",
    "performing the perturbation up to the third order we get the spin - independent first order contribution and the spin - dependent part of the dipole moment as @xmath95 where @xmath96 thus , in addition to the crystal field induced electric dipole moment the spin - orbit coupling gives rise to spin - dependent contribution .",
    "we now use the obtained results for the above case of magnetic ordering in mnwo@xmath0 with @xmath25 .",
    "each unit cell has two mn@xmath10 ions in opposite polar surroundings with polar axes along @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , using  ( [ eqs : dipolemoment ] ) for both of them and performing the proper cyclic permutation of indices @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath30 we get the electric polarization @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the unit cell volume .",
    "therefore , we obtain the same polarization as the one implied by the me interactions  ( [ eqs : magnetoelectricinteractions ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : boxion]d schematically illustrates relations  ( [ eqs : polarizationk=0 ] ) showing mn@xmath10 ions with spins @xmath34 and @xmath35 directed in such a way that the spin - dependent electric dipole moments @xmath61 and @xmath62 result in nonzero total dipole moment of the unit cell @xmath63 .",
    "other me interactions present in  ( [ eqs : magnetoelectricinteractions ] ) and absent in  ( [ eqs : polarizationk=0 ] ) can be obtained by performing the quantum perturbations to higher orders .",
    "it has to be noted , that when deriving the spin - dependent dipole moments  ( [ eqs : dipolemoment ] ) we assumed the polar distortion of the octahedral crystal field to be directed along the @xmath30 axis ( i.e. with two oxygens on the symmetry axis ) , which is not the case in mnwo@xmath0 , but this does not change our semiquantitative model .",
    "equations  ( [ eqs : polarizationk=0 ] ) give the electric polarization for magnetic structures with @xmath25 . in mnwo@xmath0",
    "the magnetic phase transitions can be described by the order parameters with @xmath21  @xcite . in this point of the brillouin zone",
    "the space group @xmath17 possesses two two - dimensional ir s @xmath99 and @xmath100 . using the magnetic representation analysis conducted earlier  @xcite , for every direction @xmath54",
    "we introduce two order parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 transforming according to @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the spin components along @xmath11 induced by these order parameters are given in table  [ tab : spinstructures ] .",

    "analogous analysis can be conducted for the @xmath12 and @xmath30 spin components .",
    "the magnetic unit cell in mnwo@xmath0 is 16 times the crystallographic one .",
    "we now sum up @xmath115 over the magnetic cell @xmath116 to obtain the electric polarization using  ( [ eqs : polarizationk=0 ] ) @xmath117 equation  ( [ eqs : py_mwo ] ) gives @xmath44 in accordance with the polarization that can be derived from the me interaction @xmath118 obtained from the macroscopic symmetry analysis  @xcite . in agreement with the experiment  @xcite and",
    "phenomenological model  @xcite @xmath44 arises in the * af2 * phase when both @xmath99 and @xmath100 condense .",
    "long - wavelength modulation does not lead to cancellation of  ( [ eqs : py_mwo ] ) as shown earlier  @xcite .",
    "similar to  ( [ eqs : py_mwo ] ) other contributions to polarization can be obtained using remaining me interactions  ( [ eqs : magnetoelectricinteractions ] ) .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath44 from  ( [ eqs : py_mwo ] ) for mnwo@xmath0 can be estimated as follows .",
    "we use the real crystal data and oxygen positions from @xcite to perform the crystal field expansion  ( [ eq : vcrystalfield ] ) and obtain @xmath119  n and @xmath120  @xmath121 . for the matrix elements @xmath122 we use the hydrogen - like orbitals and",

    "the orbitals of @xmath82 electrons of mn@xmath10 ions possess electric dipole moments due to the crystal field influence , which gives rise to additional contributions ( such as the considered @xmath83 states ) to their wave functions  ( [ eq : psiwavefunction ] ) .",

    "we show that for certain spin configurations the sum over all magnetic ions of these spin - dependent electric dipole moments gives rise to macroscopic polarization .",
