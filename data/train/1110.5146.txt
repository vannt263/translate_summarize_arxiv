    "the problem which arised in the very early days of quantum mechanics was finding the relativistic counterpart of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the most popular choices of the relativistic quantum mechanical equations for spinless massive particle are the klein - gordon equation @xcite and less familiar relativistic schrdinger equation which is usually referred to as the spinless salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "the latter can be regarded as the `` square root '' of the klein - gordon equation and is based on the approach which is sometimes referred to as the relativistic hamiltonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the klein - gordon equation is that it is manifestly covariant .",
    "its well - known flaw related to the fact that this equation is of second order in the time derivative , is the problem with the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "namely the time component of the probability four - current which in the nonrelativistic case should coincide with the probability density , can be negative . as a matter of fact , as the second order equation the klein - gordon equation can be cast into system of first order equations which can be represented in matrix - form equation .",
    "an example is the kemmer equation @xcite and the two - dimensional system discussed by feshbach and villars @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the reduction of this kind does not solve problems with the klein - gordon equation and generate new ones .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of both signs of energies for the solutions to the klein - gordon equation leads to the occurence of the `` zitterbewegung '' and the klein paradox .",
    "the `` zitterbewegung '' or trembling motion i.e.  rapidly oscillatory motion whose amplitude and period are of order @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , is the result of the interference between positive and negative energy states .",
    "the klein paradox relies on possibility of transmission to states with negative kinetic energy in the electrostatic step - like potentials . to circumvent the problem one usually suggests the creation of the particle - antiparticle pairs , that is the need",
    "is indicated for second quantization as with the pauli - weisskopf approach @xcite where the probability current is reinterpreted as a charge current . finally , the scalar product in the space of solutions of the klein - gordon equation , although lorentz covariant , is not positive definite which causes serious problems .",
    "therefore , the severe difficulties arise with the physical interpretation of the klein - gordon equation and it is widely believed that based on this equation one can not construct consistent one particle relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the disadvantage of the salpeter equation is that it is not manifestly covariant .",
    "another problem which is sometimes indicated is the nonlocality of the relativistic hamiltonian which is the pseudodifferential operator .",
    "however , as was pointed out by lmmerzahl @xcite the nonlocality of the salpeter equation does not disturb the light cone structure .",
    "the macrocausality of the second quantized version of this theory was also reported therein .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated by foldy @xcite that the space @xmath2 of solutions to the salpeter equation is invariant under the lorentz group transformations which is a direct consequence of a unitary relationship between @xmath2 and the space of the unitary irreducible representation of the inhomogeneous lorentz group @xcite . on the other hand , it is clear that nonlocal pseudodifferential equations like the salpeter equation are much more complicated than the local differential ones like the klein - gordon equation . in spite of difficulties ,",
    "the great advantage of the salpeter equation is that it possesses solutions of positive energies only , so we have no problems with paradoxes mentioned above occurring in the case of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "we also point out that agreement of predictions of the spinless salpeter equation with the experimental spectrum of mesonic atoms is as good as in the case of the klein - gordon equation @xcite . moreover , the possibility of probablistic interpretation in the quantum case as well as clear classical physical content of the salpeter equation was the motivation for its wide usage in the phenomenological description of the quark - antiquark - gluon system as a hadron model @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "after discussion of the relationship of the salpeter equation with the corresponding integro - differential equation , we introduce and examine the probablility current derived from the spinless salpeter equation .",
    "we show that such current has all good properties of its nonrelativistic counterpart .",
    "in particular , our analysis shows that the nonlocality of the salpeter equation does not disturb causal propagation of particles .",
    "the theory is illustrated by the concrete examples of exact solutions of the salpeter equation .",
    "this section is devoted to the discussion of the basic facts about the salpeter equation .",
    "the hamiltonian of a relativistic classical particle subject to the potential @xmath3 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the paricle , @xmath6 is the speed of light and @xmath7 is the three - position . in relativistic quantum mechanics the system defined by the hamiltonian ( 2.1 )",

    "we have the standard quantization rule @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . as a consequence ,",
    "the space of solutions of the salpeter equation is the hilbert space @xmath2 with the scalar product @xmath12 therefore , according to the quantum - mechanical spirit , we should identify @xmath13 with the probability density @xmath14 satisfying the normalization condition : @xmath15 motivated by usage of limiting procedures in the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic case as well as some dimensional considerations we keep in this section and the following one the physical constants @xmath16 and @xmath6 . the natural units @xmath17 and @xmath18 are utilized in sec .",

    "thus , it turns out that the pseudodifferential operator @xmath22 can be defined as the integral operator with the kernel ( 2.12 ) .",
    "consequently , the salpeter equation ( 2.2 ) takes the form of the integro - differential equation @xmath33 we also remark that the nonlocality of the salpeter equation is related only to the kinetic energy term described by the integral operator from the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the correctness of the quantization based on the massless salpeter equation was confirmed by the good behavior of the related probability density and expectation values of observables .",

    "we conclude that @xmath58 can be either positive or negative and the problem arises with the probablistic interpretation of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the expression for @xmath58 reduces to the nonrelativistic form in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath59 .",

    "the formula on the probability current for a klein - gordon particle is identical with the nonrelativistic one , that is we have @xmath60 we stress that neither the probability density ( 3.3 ) nor the probability current ( 3.4 ) has the correct limit @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , it can be checked that the continuity equation implied by the massless klein - gordon equation obtained from ( 3.1 ) by setting @xmath34 requires existence of some universal constant with the dimension of length .",
