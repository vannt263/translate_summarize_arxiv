    "for any graph @xmath3 , we call a set @xmath4 of vertices of @xmath3 an _ independent set _ if no two vertices of @xmath4 are adjacent .",
    "we let @xmath5 denote the total number of independent sets of @xmath3 and , for each @xmath6 , we let @xmath7 denote the number of independent sets of @xmath3 of size @xmath8 ; thus , @xmath9 . the quantity @xmath5 was first explicitly considered by prodinger and tichy in @xcite , who referred to it as the fibonacci number of a graph .",
    "we present two of their main results as the following theorem . here , @xmath10 denotes the @xmath0-vertex path graph , @xmath11 denotes the @xmath0-vertex cycle graph ( where the @xmath12-vertex cycle is taken to be a vertex with a loop , and the @xmath13-vertex cycle is taken to be a single edge ) , and we adopt the common conventions @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .    [ prod ] for any @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20        our main result will be a generalization of theorem  [ prod ] . for this",
    ", we will define two new classes of graphs .",
    "fix any @xmath21 with @xmath22 . create an @xmath0-vertex cycle with vertex set @xmath23 ;",
    "for each vertex of the cycle , create an @xmath24-vertex complete graph sharing with the cycle only this vertex .",
    "then , for each @xmath25 , make vertex @xmath26 adjacent to @xmath27 additional vertices of the complete graph containing vertex @xmath28 ( mod @xmath0 ) , and denote this graph @xmath29 .",
    "for example , @xmath30 is the graph :    .",
    "we refer to this class of graphs , over all valid @xmath21 , as _ chainsaw graphs_. when referring to a particular chainsaw graph @xmath29 , we call the @xmath0 vertices lying on the inner cycle its _ chain vertices _ , and we call the set of remaining vertices its _ blade vertices_. this will serve as our generalization of @xmath11 , as we will soon see .",
    "we generalize the path graph to a graph which we denote @xmath31 by considering @xmath32 and removing one of the chain vertices ( e.g. , vertex @xmath33 ) and all edges adjacent to it .",
    "we call these graphs _ broken chainsaws _ , and refer to the vertices similarly as chain and blade vertices .    with these definitions in place ,",
    "we now state our generalization of theorem  [ prod ] .",
    "as is common , we let @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the lucas sequences of the first and second kind , respectively .",
    "that is , we let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 ( so that @xmath40 are the fibonacci numbers ) ; we let @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for @xmath39 ( so that @xmath44 are the lucas numbers ) .    [ chainsaw ] for any @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 , we have that @xmath45 and that @xmath46    ",
    "we prove this theorem in section  [ proofs ] while discussing some relationships between dickson polynomials and lucas sequences and providing some graph - theoretic interpretations of these well - studied objects .",
    "we note that theorem  [ prod ] is the special case of theorem  [ chainsaw ] when @xmath47 .",
    "in this section we examine the relationship between dickson polynomials and lucas sequences and discuss some results which will be crucial to proving theorem  [ chainsaw ] . in the process",
    ", we provide new graph - theoretic interpretations of lucas sequences and dickson polynomials .",
    "as is common , we use @xmath48 and @xmath49 to denote dickson polynomials of the first and second kind , respectively .",
    "that is , we let @xmath50 and @xmath51 we start with the following result which is known in finite field theory .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite for more on this result . for more information on dickson polynomials in general ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for any @xmath18 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54        we will prove theorem  [ chainsaw ] by showing that the @xmath55 term of ( [ firstkind ] ) and the @xmath55 term of ( [ secondkind ] ) can be graph - theoretically interpreted as the number of independent sets in the chainsaw graph @xmath29 and the broken chainsaw graph @xmath31 , respectively , which contain exactly @xmath8 chain vertices .",
    "for this , we will need the following result , which is well known in graph theory , and is not difficult to prove .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .    for any @xmath18 and @xmath56",
    ", we have @xmath57 and we also have @xmath58        with this in place , we are now ready to proceed to the proof of theorem  [ chainsaw ] .",
    "fix @xmath21 so that @xmath22 . as previously discussed , it follows from ( [ secondkind ] ) and ( [ oldstuffpath ] ) that ( [ pathgen ] ) holds if the number of independent sets in @xmath31 which contain exactly @xmath8 chain vertices for @xmath56 is given by @xmath59 first , note that the number of ways to choose @xmath8 independent chain vertices in @xmath31 , by definition , is @xmath60 .",
    "then , once @xmath8 independent chain vertices are chosen , there are @xmath8 sets of @xmath61 blade vertices and @xmath62 sets of @xmath63 blade vertices with which they share no adjacencies , so ( [ firstob ] ) holds .",
    "a similar argument shows that the number of independent sets in @xmath29 which contain exactly @xmath8 chain vertices for @xmath56 is given by @xmath64 and thus , by ( [ firstkind ] ) and ( [ oldstuff ] ) , we have ( [ cyclegen ] ) .    a graph - theoretic interpretation of the lucas sequence is now established by theorem  [ chainsaw ] , and from its proof emerges a graph - theoretic interpretation of the terms of the dickson polynomial .",
    "we would like to thank professor robert coulter for bringing our attention to the connection between lucas sequences and dickson polynomials , which led to a much shorter proof of our main result .",
    "we also thank both him and professor felix lazebnik for their suggestions on the preliminary draft of this note .",
