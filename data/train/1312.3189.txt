    "this suggests the ` hot qcd matter ' to be the ` most perfect fluid '  @xcite . on the empirical side , relativistic viscous hydrodynamic calculations ( using the israel - stewart framework ) also require a very small @xmath16 of @xmath21 in order to reproduce the rhic elliptic flow @xmath15 data @xcite ; these phenomenological findings thus are in accord with the theoretical studies for @xmath16 in refs .",

[ pic : bcvst ] .",
    "accordingly , the response of the qgp in actual heavy - ion experiments should be diamagnetic",
    ". however , for the much higher field strength explored in lattice qcd calculations @xcite for temperatures close to @xmath17 the response should be paramagnetic .",

    "similar statements ( with less accuracy ) hold for the magnetic susceptibility in ( [ eq20 ] ) which gives @xmath202 = 0.49 .",
    "the scaling ( [ eq20 ] ) can be traced back again to the scaling of the quark+antiquark density @xmath203 in the dqpm .     in eq .",

    "in conclusion , we have evaluated the electric conductivity @xmath56 of the quark - gluon plasma as a function of temperature @xmath0 and quark chemical potential @xmath1 by employing the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) off - shell transport model in a finite box for the simulation of dynamical partonic systems in equilibrium .",
    "the phsd approach in the partonic sector is based on the lattice qcd equation of state of  @xcite ; accordingly , it describes the qgp entropy density @xmath205 , the energy density @xmath206 and the pressure @xmath207 from lqcd  @xcite very well .",
    "studies of the qcd matter within phsd have previously given reasonable results also for the shear and bulk viscosities @xmath208 and @xmath209 versus @xmath0  @xcite and related transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "in extension of our previous study in ref .",
    "@xcite we have found that the electric conductivity shows a simple scaling with @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "eq.(8 ) ) which essentially can be traced back to the variation of the quark+antiquark density @xmath210 of the system in the dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm ) .",
    "we recall that phsd calculations in a fixed box in equilibrium give practically the same results for the equation of state of qcd matter and transport coefficients as the dqpm @xcite . in analogy to the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath16 we find a clear minimum of the dimensionless ratio @xmath6 in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath17 with values close to more recent lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "this prediction as well as the explicit dependence on @xmath1 should be controlled by related qcd studies on the lattice .",
    "the frequency dependence of the complex electric conductivity @xmath9 is found to be well in line with the simple results from the dqpm ( 11 ) , too .",
    "furthermore , we have explored the response of the partonic system on a moderate external magnetic field @xmath211 gev / fm and studied separately the diamagnetic response from the lorentz force ( 1 ) and the paramagnetic response due to the interaction of the quark spin with the magnetic field in eq .",
    "within the temperature range investigated ( 170 mev @xmath212 250 mev ) the magnetic moment due to the lorentz force rises with temperature @xmath0 but drops with @xmath213 providing a constant energy shift due to a coupling to the magnetic field @xmath214 .",
    "the coupling of the spin to the @xmath142-field gives a paramagnetic contribution which can well be characterized by a magnetic susceptibility @xmath10 .",
    "its contribution to the energy shift of the system is negative and increases with @xmath190 .",
    "according , there is a critical magnetic field @xmath12 for which the response of the system changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic .",
    "the actual values for @xmath12 ( cf . fig .",
    "12 ) demonstrate that the response of the qgp in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions should be diamagnetic since the maximal magnetic fields created in these collisions are smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "as in case of the electric conductivity the dependence of the energy shift @xmath196 as well as the magnetic susceptibility @xmath10 show a very similar scaling correction @xmath215 with a coefficient of order 0.5 .",
    "we close by noting that in the hadronic phase for temperatures below @xmath17 and @xmath1 = 0 the system dominantly consists of pseudoscalar mesons that have no spin and accordingly a low ( or vanishing ) paramagnetic contribution to the magnetization @xmath31 when restricting to the first order in the magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the charged hadrons see the lorentz force ( 1 ) and build up a diamagnetic contribution .",
