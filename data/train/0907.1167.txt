    "charge and orbital order ( co - oo ) in mixed - valence manganites with perovskite - related structures has been attracting great interest since the co - oo makes a strong impact on crystallography , magnetism , and electrical conduction@xcite .",
    "for example , magnetic - field induced melting of long - range and/or short - range co - oo results in colossal magnetoresistance@xcite .",
    "huge changes in electrical conduction due to the melting of co - oo have been reported with the application of other external stimuli , such as an electric field , x - ray , light , and pressure @xcite .",
    "many diffraction and theoretical studies have reported the checkerboard type charge order of mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 ions with charge disproportionation and stripe - type orbital order , explaining a complex antiferromagnetic spin order at low temperatures in half - doped manganites @xcite . on the other hand , another model with less distinct charge disproportionation",
    "has also been proposed@xcite .",
    "for example , taking into account the on - site coulomb interaction , brink _ et al .",
    "_ have suggested@xcite that maximum value of charge disproportionation is as little as 20% .",
    "first principle calculation by mahadevan _",
    "_ have also shown@xcite that the charge disproprtionation is almost negligible for la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath8 compound .",
    "herrero - martin _ et al .",
    "_ have inferred@xcite from the resonant x - ray scattering data that the charge disproportionation of nd@xmath6sr@xmath6mno@xmath9 is about 20 % .",
    "these different models have raised an important question about the nature of co state .",
    "another issue to be clarified is the orbital shape at mn@xmath0 ion in the co - oo phase .",
    "suggested by powder neutron and synchrotron x - ray diffraction studies that the ( @xmath12)/(@xmath13)-type orbital order takes place in la@xmath6ca@xmath6mno@xmath9@xcite .",
    "la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath8 was also studied as another co - oo system by resonant x - ray scattering and x - ray linear dichroism methods@xcite ; the latter @xcite strongly suggested the ( @xmath10)/(@xmath11)-type orbital shape at mn@xmath0 ion .",
    "it is an unsolved problem why the orbital shape of la@xmath6ca@xmath6mno@xmath9 and la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath8 appear different .",
    "one obvious difference between these two materials is the dimensionality of mno@xmath14 network .",
    "the variation of the dimensionality has already been reported @xcite to affect the co - oo state significantly in terms of correlation length , but its effect on the orbital shape should be investigated systematically . to clarify these issues ,",
    "we have made systematic investigations on the charge disproportionation and orbital shape in the co - oo phases of half - doped manganites with various mn - o networks ( single- , double- , and infinite - layered mno@xmath4 sheets ) by means of x - ray structure analysis .",
    "the results indicate that the charge disproportionation is in reality much smaller than unity , and that the orbital shape critically depends on the lattice form , in particular on the dimensionality of mn - o network . as far as we know ,",
    "there has been no experimental investigation on the charge disproportionation for the layered manganites thus far .",
    "the investigated materials in this study are pr@xmath6ca@xmath6mno@xmath9 , pr(sr@xmath2ca@xmath3)@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath5 , and eu@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 with pseudo cubic , double - layer , and single - layer mn - o networks , respectively .",
    "we chose these materials with good size matching of the ionic radii at the @xmath15-sites to reduce the effect of quenched disorder ( randomness ) as much as possible@xcite .",
    "another important point in selecting the target materials is that the well - defined orthorhombic distortion of all these materials enables us to obtain the single - domain orbital - ordered state as locked by the orthorhombicity .",
    "the concomitant co - oo is observed at @xmath16 which is higher than the ce - type antiferromagnetic ordering in every case@xcite . in pr@xmath6ca@xmath6mno@xmath9 and eu@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 , the co - oo transitions take place at @xmath17230 k and 325 k , and the ce - type antiferromagnetic order with spins pointing along the @xmath18-axis is established at @xmath19170 k and 120 k , respectively@xcite . the ferromagnetic zig - zag chain is parallel to the @xmath18-axis in pr@xmath6ca@xmath6mno@xmath9 , and to @xmath20-axis in eu@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , successive co - oo transitions are observed at @xmath21370 k and @xmath22315 k in pr(sr@xmath2ca@xmath3)@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath5 . the propagation direction of stripe - type orbital order spontaneously rotates from along the @xmath20-axis to along the @xmath18-axis at @xmath23 ; this appears as a generic feature of co - oo double - layer manganites@xcite .",
    "ce - type antiferromagnetic order with spins pointing along @xmath18-axis grows below @xmath19153 k@xcite , and the ferromagnetic zig - zag chain is along @xmath20-axis . in both of the eu@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 and pr(sr@xmath2ca@xmath3)@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ,",
    "co - oo produces clear anisotropy of electronic states , typically manifested by the optical conductivity spectra , in which the oscillator strength at low energy region is more suppressed in orbital - stripe direction than in orbital zig - zag chain direction@xcite",
    "we have performed structure analysis for single crystals of eu@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 and pr(sr@xmath2ca@xmath3)@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath5 grown by the floating zone method .",
    "the crystals were crashed into small grains .",
    "x - ray diffraction experiments were performed for twin - free single crystals with a diameter of about 30 @xmath24 m on the beamline bl-1a at photon factory in kek , japan .",
    "the photon energy of the incident x - rays was tuned at 18 kev(@xmath25=0.688  ) .",
    "x - ray beams were shaped into a square with the size of 300 @xmath24 m @xmath26 300 @xmath24 m by a collimator , which is enough larger than the size of samples . to detect x - rays ,",
    "a large cylindrical imaging plate was utilized .",
    "temperature was controlled by a nitrogen gas stream cryostat .",
    "the intensity data were operated to the f - tables by using the program of rapid - auto , rigaku corp . and",
    "the sir2004 program@xcite was employed for the direct method .",
    "we used the program of crystalstructure of rigaku corp . and msc .",
    "for analyzing the crystal structure from the f - table .",
    "absorption effects were not corrected , because the @xmath27 were enough small in each sample . for eu@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 and pr(sr@xmath2ca@xmath3)@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ,",

    "to check this assumption , we tried to correct the absorption effects .",
    "no difference was observed for the structural data obtained with and without the absorption correction .    for the analysis , we used thus determined crystal structure data for eu@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 and pr(sr@xmath2ca@xmath3)@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath5 , and the published data for pr@xmath6ca@xmath6mno@xmath9 by goff _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
