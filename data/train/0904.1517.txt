    "the understanding of natural , technological and social phenomena through the network perspective has motivated a large body of research in the past @xmath0 years @xcite , as many of their properties can be inferred from the simple idea that relations among elements in such systems can be interpreted , at a certain level of abstraction , as nodes and links of a complex network .",
    "examples range from physically interacting proteins in the cell @xcite and the set of routers comprising the internet @xcite to social networks @xcite and , according to empirical measurements of a few network properties , like degree distribution and correlations , clustering and average shortest path , it is observed that many of these networks are strikingly similar ( in the statistical sense ) @xcite .",
    "thus , generic features of these networks can be predicted by the analysis of simple models . since the classic work of erds and rnyi @xcite , a whole set of interesting results in percolation theory have been brought up revealing the importance of network structure in determining critical properties @xcite . in particular , it has been found that in nonequilibrium ( growing ) networks with exponential @xcite or power - law degree distribution @xcite an infinite order critical point separates a phase with many finite clusters from another where a single macroscopic connected cluster emerges .",
    "it has been shown both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite that all the derivatives of the average size of the largest cluster , taken as the order parameter , are zero at the critical point . here",
    "we study a similar problem , where networks are grown by the addition of nodes and links that attach preferentially , but with an age - dependent probability .",
    "with computer simulations and scaling arguments we show that one has a first - order transition in the size of the giant connected cluster as one makes it less likely to attach links to older nodes . following the transition the topology of the largest cluster changes from tree - like to one - dimensional , as one can infer from measurements of the average shortest - path length inside the largest cluster in each phase .",
    "let a network grow from an initial cluster of @xmath1 fully - connected nodes ( we use @xmath2 ) by the addition of a node and a link at each time step .",
    "this new link will randomly join a pair of nodes @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the probability that a node with @xmath6 links and added at time @xmath7 to the network receives a link is necessary for the newly added node , which has @xmath8 , to participate in the dynamics .",

    "self - links and multiple links between the same pair of nodes are forbidden .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 plays the role of the inverse of a timescale @xmath12 , which suppresses the attractiveness of older nodes for new connections .",
    "the case @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) has been extensively studied in @xcite , who reported an infinite - order phase transition as the number @xmath15 of links added per time step is varied around a critical value @xmath16 . here",
    "we analyze the effect of varying the memory parameter @xmath11 and find another nontrivial phase transition at a critical value @xmath17 separating a phase with multiple clusters from another where a single , @xmath18 , giant component emerges .    for each value of @xmath11",
    "we grow @xmath19 networks with up to @xmath20 nodes .",
    "since we do not force the newly added node to immediately attach to a preexisting cluster , there is always a possibility to create networks with isolated clusters . for a given value of @xmath11 , we identify these clusters in each network with breadth - first - search and calculate the average size of the largest cluster @xmath21 in each network , normalized by the total number of nodes @xmath22 ( fig .",

    "this might result from the fact that , close to @xmath17 , the dimensionless scaling variable for the average size of the largest cluster @xmath42 is @xmath43 , as appears from the scaling of the rounding of the phase transition [ eq .",

    "one might guess this result by noting that when @xmath66 , the most typical configuration is a line of nodes , that is , each added node gets connected to its immediate neighbor in the past . given @xmath67 , the probability of joining nodes @xmath68 and @xmath15 with ages @xmath69 and @xmath70 and degrees @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , and neglecting , as a first approximation , terms with contributions smaller than @xmath73 , the probability that a newly added node gets connected to this line is @xmath74 and",
    "a new cluster emerges with probability @xmath75 .",
    "these probabilities get comparable when @xmath76 but , since there is always a nonzero chance of not connecting the new node to the previous ones one finds that for large values of @xmath11 the system should have scaling properties of a critical one - dimensional percolation network .",
    "we also find power - law scaling for the divergence of the susceptibility at the critical point @xmath77 with @xmath78 , as depicted in fig .",

    "the emergence of a giant connected component is followed by a change from tree - like to quasi - one dimensional topology , as indicates the crossover from logarithmic to linear scaling of @xmath82 with @xmath22 . ]    in the limit @xmath58 , when the age - dependence becomes vanishingly small , links between nodes are added in a random fashion ( although with different rates on nodes with different degrees ) and the finite clusters are locally trees in the large size limit @xcite . in this limit",
    "one should expect a logarithmic dependence of the average shortest - path length @xmath83 with system size @xmath22    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the minimum number of links that must be traversed to join nodes @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and @xmath88 means average over realizations . on the other side , on @xmath89-dimensional networks",
    "@xmath90 is proportional to the linear dimension @xmath91 .",
    "thus , as one increases the effects of aging in the preferential attachment of links , one expects a transition from `` small '' to `` large - world '' networks @xcite , or a change from logarithmic to linear scaling of the average shortest - path with system size . in fig .",

    "we have studied the percolating properties of growing networks with age and degree preferential attachment of links : nodes introduced earlier in time are exponentially less likely to acquire new links than `` younger '' ones and links attach preferentially to nodes with high degree .",
    "one node and one link are introduced at each time step and the effect of aging on a node with age @xmath68 and @xmath6 links is varied by changing the exponent @xmath11 in the age- and connectivity- dependent attachment probability @xmath95 .",
    "this model has a discontinuous transition in the relative size of the largest connected component : below a critical value @xmath17 there is an extensive number of topologically tree - like clusters of connected nodes and at a first - order critical point a giant cluster of linearly connected nodes emerges .",
    "we analyzed the properties of this phase transition with numerical simulations , finding that fluctuations of the order parameter scale linearly with system size and that , close to the critical point , the inverse of a characteristic length scale vanishes linearly with the distance from the critical point , suggesting that the transition is in the universality class of @xmath45 percolation .",
