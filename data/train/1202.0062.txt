    "accretion onto supermassive black holes liberates copious amounts of energy , mainly as big blue bumps and x - rays , driving many phenomena associated with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , such as broad emission lines and outflows .",
    "numerous attempts have been made over the past four decades to construct a self - consistent model of agns , but these have not yet been successful and the structure of agns and quasars remains largely unsolved .",
    "principle component analysis ( pca ) for large samples of agns ( boroson & green 1992 ; vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ; marziani et al . 2003 ; 2010 )",
    "has shown that the eddington ratio is tightly correlated with eigenvector 1 and the properties of the broad emission lines .",
    "in addition , the broad line region ( blr ) metallicity relates with agn luminosity or eddington ratios , linking with the feeding process ( hamann & ferland 1999 ; shemmer et al .",
    "2004 ; warner et al . 2004 ; matsuoka et al . 2011 ) .",
    "it is likely that accretion onto the super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) and the appearance of blrs are accompanying processes resulting from supplying gas to the central engine , and the properties of the blr are determined by the supplying processes .",
    "spectra of seyfert galaxies and quasars generally show broad emission lines with full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of a few @xmath2 ( see the reviews by osterbrock & mathews 1986 ; netzer 1990 ; sulentic et al .",
    "2000 and ho 2008 ) .",
    "blrs are generally discussed as being composed of discrete rapidly moving clouds responsible for emitting the observed broad lines , although the smoothness of the observed profiles indicates that there must be large numbers of such clouds ( arav et al .",
    "1997 ; ferland 2004 ; laor 2006 ; laor et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "[ chart_flow ]    it has been speculated for a long time that these clouds are formed from the thermal instability of the hot gas .",
    "however , some major questions remain open :    * why does the blr form ? * what are the origins of the emitting gas and its high metalicity ? * what are properties of cold clouds formed by thermal instability ?",
    "* what is the geometry of the blr ?",
    "* do the blr clouds relate to phenomenon of agn outflows ?",
    "the existing models listed below in  6 generally treat the above issues as being independent of each other , but there is increasing evidence that they are in fact closely related .",
    "first , the gravitational energy is mainly released around @xmath3 schwarzschild radii , but the well - known reverberation mapping relation of the strong correlation between blr size and ionizing luminosity indicates @xmath4 with @xmath5 schwarzschild radii ( kaspi et al . 2000 ; 2005 ) .",
    "the mapping relation is so strong that we believe there is an intrinsic connection between the accretion onto the smbhs and blr formation though the two scales are differing by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "the intrinsic connection could be complex somehow .",
    "if the broadening mechanism is due to an assembly of clouds with keplerian rotation , the differences in width of different emission lines indicates that the blr is an extended region .",
    "a flattened disk is then favored ( laor 2007 ; collin et al .",
    "second , it is well - known that quasars are metal - rich , generally a few times the solar abundance and up to ten or more times the solar value ( hamann & ferland 1992 ) , and that higher metallicity correlates with higher luminosity , eddington ratios or smbh mass ( hamann & ferland 1999 ; shemmer et al . 2004 ; netzer et al .",
    "2004 ; warner et al . 2004 ; matsuoka et al .",
    "in particular , the metallicity does _ not _ relate with the ir luminosity ( simon & hamann 2010 ) .",
    "all of these results provide potential clues for understanding the formation of blrs and related phenomena , in the context of the blr being a by - product of the feeding process .",
    "in addition , it has gradually been realized that star formation is not only important for feeding the smbhs , but also for the metallicity observed in the broad line regions ( wang et al .",

    "it should be emphasized that the skins are continuously supplied by the sf disk , resulting in a non - stationary state in the compton gas .",

    "the sf disk is assumed to be located in the region between the self - gravitating radius ( @xmath7 ) and the inner edge of the torus .",
    "the self - gravitating radius is given by @xmath17 ( laor & netzer 1989 ) , where @xmath18 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the radiative efficiency , assuming toomre s parameter @xmath22 ( goodman 2003 ; rafikov 2009 ; collin & zahn 2008 ) .",
    "we take as the inner radius of the dusty torus @xmath23pc , for quasars with @xmath24 .",
    "the density and temperature of the warm gas inside the sf disk are determined by the balance of heating and cooling .",

    "the sound speed of the warm gas is @xmath36 , which is smaller than the escape velocity @xmath37 ( within @xmath38 ) .",

    "we find that the total mass rates of the warm gas diffusion over the entire sf disk can be as high as a few @xmath44 , which exceeds the eddington limit for a @xmath45 smbhs .",
    "it should be noted that the diffusion rates are much smaller than the inflow rate of the sf disk ( @xmath46 ; see wang et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the skins have less significant influence on the sf disk itself .",
    "the warm skins caused by the evaporation from the sf disk have the same angular momentum as the disk .",

    "we will show that the continuous injection driven by this pressure leads to a transient appearance of the blr .",
    "in our discussion of the blr formation , we assume a steady star formation rate in the sf disk during one episode of smbh activity .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the properties of the warm skin are governed by the star formation rate in the sf disk , or by the surface density of the disk itself .",
    "since the skins are totally influenced by the central engine , they just provide the boundary condition of the compton atmosphere for the blr formation discussed later .",
    "the cas undergoes a complicated evolution which drives the episodic appearance of a blr even in response to continuous injection from the sf disk .",
    "[ hc ]        we mainly consider two processes of heating by the agn continuum as the main mechanisms : compton heating and photoionzation . assuming a point energy source with luminosity @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) at the center , compton heating rates are given by ( levich and sunyaev 1970 ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the photon flux of the agn continuum ( in @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 is the thompson cross section , @xmath59 is the planck constant , @xmath60 is the mass of the electron and @xmath61 is the number density of electrons .",
    "here @xmath62 , @xmath49 , @xmath63 is the distance of the ionized gas to the center and @xmath64hz . here",
    "the compton heating is simply expressed for a cas with a constant density typical of that at the characteristic radius .",
    "we include the dependence on radius in following calculations .",
    "the heating rate due to photoionization is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66k ( beltrametti 1981 ) .",
    "we note that the photoionization heating rate must actually depend on the ionization parameter ( defined by equation 13 ) . here",
    "we just use a simple approximation from the published literature that is roughly correct for the conditions in the blr .",
    "fortunately , equation ( 7 ) does not affect the triggering thermal instability , although the final temperature of cold clouds depends on the ionization parameter .",
    "this simplified version of the heating will be improved in a future paper .",
    "the free - free absorption coefficient is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , and only becomes significant at radio frequencies . considering that the gravitational energy is originally released from optical to hard x - rays ,",
    "the free - free absorption is neglected here though radio and ir photons can significantly heat the medium through this process ( ferland & baldwin 1999 ) . however , for those low luminosity agns powered by advection - dominated accretion flows , heating by radio emission can not be neglected in the total energy budget of emission lines .",
    "in particular , clouds responsible for emission lines in low ionization emission regions ( liners ) have been strongly influenced by the radio heating .",
    "however , we focus here on the radio - quiet quasars in which the radio emission is much fainter than the other bands .",
    "we have the total heating function as @xmath69 .",
    "three cooling processes are important : 1 ) compton cooling ; 2 ) free - free cooling and 3 ) line cooling .",
    "the compton cooling is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath64hz , and the bremsstrahlung cooling is @xmath72 the line cooling function has been extensively studied by many authors ( e.g. bhringer & hensler 1989 ; sutherland & dopita 1993 ; gnat & sternberg 2007 ) .",

    "this approximation is accurate to within 10% over the whole domain of temperatures from @xmath81k , but it does not apply free - free emission of fully ionized gas ( @xmath82k ) .",
    "this is sufficient for the purposes of the present paper .",
    "the total cooling functions is then @xmath83 .",
    "we wish to stress the important role of metallicity in the cooling .",
    "the metallicity gradient suggested by w11 implies different cooling functions at different radii .",
    "as shown by subsequent figure 3 , the inner regions are overheated , if they are metal - poor , so that cold clouds are forbidden to form .",
    "a proper metallicity is necessary at a radius to cool the heating so that formation of clouds is permitted at this distance .",

    "2006 ; vasudevan et al . 2009 ; grupe et al .",
    "the compton temperature is determined by the photon mean energy ( @xmath85 ) of the sed in the @xmath84pc region .",
    "the hard x - ray sed is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 with a cutoff at roughly @xmath88 kev ( with the exception of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies in grupe et al.s ( 2010 ) sample , which have quite soft spectra in hard x - rays ) .",
    "the optical - uv sed has index @xmath89 and a cutoff at 0.1kev .",
    "for this mean quasar sed , the compton temperature is @xmath90 agreeing with netzer ( 2008 ) , where @xmath91 is the boltzmann constant , in light of the sed .",
    "this compton temperature is at or slightly above the critical values below which serious absorption appears in soft x - rays ( e.g. petre et al .",
    "1984 ; mathews & ferland 1987 ) .",
    "we use the compton temperature @xmath92k in this paper , which is generally lower than the virial temperature given by @xmath93k , indicating the diffuse gas is still bound by the potential of the smbhs .",
    "this heated gas forms an atmosphere above the sf disk .",
    "the timescale of compton heating is @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath63 is the distance from the smbh , @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the eddington ratio and @xmath99 is the bolometric luminosity .",
    "this timescale is very important for determining the fate of the warm skins above the sf disk .    from figure 3",

    ", we find the approximate dependence @xmath100 .",
    "the cas is not an exactly isothermal atmosphere .",
    "it should be pointed out that formation of clouds is a local event in the cas , and the global properties of the cas hardly affect cloud formation .",
    "the ionization parameter of the gas supplied by the sf disk is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the ionizing luminosity and @xmath103 is in units of @xmath104 .",
    "this definition is very convenient for discussing the two - phase model with a pressure balance .",
    "it is well - known that the s - shaped relation between @xmath105 and @xmath106 shows the thermal states of the ionized plasma ( krolik et al .",
    "when @xmath107 , the ionized plasma will have only one hot phase with compton temperature .",
    "only a cold phase exists when @xmath108 .",
    "figure [ sed_t]_b _ shows a comparison of the compton and virial temperatures , indicating that the compton gas is not able to escape from the smbh potential .",
    "in the presence of continuous injection due to thermal diffusion , the compton gas accumulates and its density increases .",
    "the ionization parameter of the compton gas will drop until thermal instability develops . as we argue below",
    ", a two - phase medium will form in the compton gas once the gas injected from the sf disk is sufficiently dense .",
    "the ionization parameter is a strong function of the distance to the black hole . as a convenient estimate of the thermal state of the ionized gas ,",
    "we divide the regions into two parts with the boundary at @xmath109 , corresponding to @xmath110 . the inner part , known as the high ionization line ( hil ) region , has higher values of the ionization parameter with typical @xmath111 .",
    "the outer part , called the low ionization line ( lil ) region , is characterized here by the lower value @xmath112 .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the hil and lil regions .",
    "detailed discussions are given in section 3.4.3 , 4.2 and 4.3 .",
    "another definition of ionization parameter as @xmath113 ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) is often used to distinguish the lil and hil regions , with @xmath114 corresponding to the hil region(e.g .",

    "2010 ) .",
    "[ phase ]      thermal conduction in the cas plays a key role in governing the growth of instability .",
    "its importance can be assessed by considering the heating rate for conduction @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the scale of the perturbation length of the temperature , and @xmath117 is spitzer s coefficient of thermal conductivity ( spitzer 1962 ) . comparing it with the free - free cooling rate gives @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the initial length of the thermal perturbation , while its ratio to the photoionization heating rate is @xmath120 , showing that conduction must be considered in the energy balance .",
    "when the perturbation length @xmath116 is smaller than @xmath121 cm , thermal conduction will smear the perturbation within the thermal timescale and prevent development of the thermal instability and formation of clouds .    as a summary , we have the net heating function @xmath122 which are approximated by equations ( 6 - 10 ) for a hot plasma with temperature of @xmath123 .",
    "it should be noted that unlike other processes , thermal conduction is excluded in this equation , but it appears in equation ( 33 ) since it only happens between a hot and a cold medium .",
    "thermal instability of isobaric gas at a constant pressure occurs when @xmath124 , since the heating rate rises faster than the cooling rate , determining the fate of the cas that has arisen from the sf disk .",
    "figure [ hc ] shows the heating and cooling functions versus temperature at different radii and metallicity .",
    "we set @xmath24 , bolometric luminosity @xmath125 and the sed of the photoionizing source is from figure [ sed_t ] .      the warm skin above the sf disk is inevitably heated by the central engine , producing a new static equilibrium .",
    "the heated and expanded skin is referred to as the compton atmosphere ( cas ) because it has the compton temperature , @xmath126k ( see  2.2.3 ) .",
    "its height is @xmath127 where @xmath128k .",
    "the higher the compton temperature , the thicker the cas .",
    "since the cas has angular momentum taken from the sf disk , it forms a flattened disk around the axis perpendicular to the sf disk . as we discuss below , cold clouds are born through the thermal instability in the cas , but they do not always follow the dynamics of the cas . once the cold clouds are formed from the cas , their dynamics and fates are governed by the smbh gravity , radiation pressure from the central engine and the friction of the cas . depending on their column density and metallicity ,",
    "cold clouds are either blown away as cloud outflows driven by the radiation pressure , or sink backward onto the sf disk , or are destroyed by the dynamical friction of the cas and then recycle back into the cas .",
    "we would like to point out that the compton temperature is determined by the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which depends on the eddington ratios ( wang et al .",
    "this implies that the blr geometry might relate to the eddington ratios , namely , the properties of broad emission lines correlate with the eddington ratios .",
    "this is indeed true in large samples of quasars ( marziani et al .",
    "2009 ) , where the eigenvector 1 spectra depends on the eddington ratio .",
    "finally the mass ratio of the compton gas converting into cold clouds remains a free parameter in the present model .",
    "a self - consistent model could resolve this problem .",
    "for a typical luminous qso with continuum luminosity @xmath129 , the total mass needed to provide the emission lines seen from the full blr is of order @xmath130 ( baldwin et al .",
    "this estimate includes neutral material in the interiors of optically thick clouds , and we use it here for the total mass of the lil clouds , which we designate @xmath131 . for the case of the optically - thin hil clouds ,",
    "we use just the zones within the clouds which produce  emission , which would correspond to @xmath132 for the same continuum luminosity . following peterson ( 1997 ) , we round this down to @xmath133 .",
    "the timescales for supplying the hil and lil masses are given by @xmath134 we find that @xmath135yr for typical @xmath133 and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) , and @xmath138yr for @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "it generally follows that @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "this means that all the supplied gas will be efficiently heated to the compton temperature until the two timescales are equal .",
    "the cas keeps a quasi - static equilibrium state so that we use a linear analysis to treat its thermal instability , which depends on the equilibrium .",
    "[ phase ]      once clouds have formed , they are subject to destruction by various dynamical processes provided the cas is sufficiently dense ( see mathews & blumenthal 1977 ; krolik et al . 1981 ; mathews 1986 for details of these destruction processes ) .",
    "if they are not destroyed instantly , they may undergo one of three different fates depending on their properties and the cas density . if the clouds column density is small enough , radiation pressure may blow them away from the region where they born , forming outflows ( boroson 2005 ) and increasing the metallicity in narrow line regions .",
    "this process simply decreases the total mass of the atmosphere .",
    "the second possibility is for the clouds to sink to the sf disk since they are too heavy to be supported by the buoyancy and radiation pressure ( as shown in ",
    "this also simply decreases the total mass of the atmosphere .",
    "the third possible fate is for a cycle between the cas and the clouds ( krolik 1988 ) .",
    "the clouds are destroyed by the dynamic interaction with the cas and return mass to the cas , which then forms new clouds .",
    "this opens the way to an eventual collapse of the cas .",
    "the mass cycle does not decrease the total mass of the atmosphere , while at the same time the continuous supply from the sf disk steadily increases the total mass of the cas .",
    "if then at some point the mass stored in the clouds is rapidly released into the atmosphere through dynamical destruction , the optical depth of the atmosphere is suddenly amplified , making the irradiation insufficient and the cooling of the cas very efficient .",
    "this induces the cas to catastrophically collapse onto the sf disk .",
    "this process drives episodic appearance of the blrs , at least in some parts .",
    "we will discuss these complicated processes in  4 .",
    "those optically thin clouds formed in the innermost regions are almost instantly blown away by the radiation pressure .",
    "this might be related to the formation of narrow line regions ( wang et al .",
    "2011 in preparation ) .",
    "evidence for this is the tight correlation between the blr and the nlr metallicities ( wang et al .",
    "the acceleration of the clouds in this region is discussed in  4.2 .",
    "once the supplied gas is exposed to the central engine , it will be heated up to the compton temperature and will become a rotating flattened disk of compton gas .",
    "we stress that the continuous injection into the atmosphere from the sf disk leads to a complicated evolution of the atmosphere .",
    "the cas is undergoing heating by the accretion disk and radiative cooling , and also is carrying the keplerian angular momentum from the sf disk .",
    "the resulting gas flows are reflected in the initial motions of the cold clouds that form from the cas , and thus are reflected in the observed profiles of broad emission lines .",
    "we first consider the mass budget of the cas . for simplicity , we assume the cold clouds which form from the cas all have the same mass and size unless we point out the difference in the lil and hil .",
    "the cas evolution can generally be divided into the four phases illustrated by figure [ phase ] : phase i : accumulation of the atmosphere is simply governed by the injection from the sf disk ; phase ii : formation and pile - up of clouds are driven by the thermal instability along with significant downward - spiraling of clouds to the sf disk ; phase iii : the atmosphere is so dense that sinking clouds are destroyed by dynamical friction , forming a cycle between clouds and atmosphere , and phase iv : the dense atmosphere is not supported by the gas pressure , giving rise to a collapse of the atmosphere into the sf disk .",
    "phase i continues until the time @xmath144 when the line cooling dominates over the compton cooling . during this phase",
    ", we have @xmath145 at @xmath144 , the cas enters phase ii .",
    "cold clouds form and separate from the cas atmosphere . during phase ii , some clouds sink to the sf disk and we have @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the birth rates of clouds , and @xmath148 is the mass of each cloud . since the cas is not yet very dense , the damping can be neglected in this phase .",
    "the sinking velocity of clouds can be estimated by @xmath149 with a timescale of @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the keplerian rotation velocity .",
    "this means that clouds will sink to the sf disk roughly within a keplerian timescale .",
    "it should be noted that this simple estimation does not include the influence of the cas friction .",
    "the sinking timescale could be longer then .",
    "the cas comes into phase iii when it becomes sufficiently dense that dynamical friction destroys the clouds before they can sink all the way to the sf disk , leading to return of cloud material to the atmosphere .",
    "we now have @xmath152 and @xmath153 , where @xmath154 .",
    "since mass continues to be injected from the sf disk , the cas will become denser and denser until its temperature balance becomes dominated by line cooling .",
    "the catastrophe is then triggered , leading to a collapse of the cas onto the sf disk .",
    "the collapse timescale ( @xmath155 ) is determined by the maximum of the sinking timescale ( @xmath156 ) and cooling timescale ( @xmath157 ) , namely , @xmath158 in the following sections , we will determine the critical times and the corresponding densities .",
    "there is a necessary condition for continuous injection from the sf disk into the cas , namely , the gas pressure in the sf disk ( @xmath52 ) should be higher than that of the cas ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "otherwise , the injection will stop if @xmath160 .",
    "these pressures are compared in figure 5_b _ , and it is seen that @xmath161 throughout phases i - iii .",
    "this guarantees the continuous injection to the cas from the sf disk .      for a fully ionized compton gas ,",
    "the radiative acceleration is @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "before line cooling dominates , radiation pressure acting on the ions is mainly through thompson scattering by electrons .",
    "provided the radiation luminosity of the smbh is sub - eddington , the compton gas is bound by the smbh potential since its thermal temperature is lower than the virial temperature .",
    "the compton gas will accumulate until it becomes partially ionized . at that point",
    "the radiation pressure will be enhanced by line absorption , and the partially ionized gas will be blown away if the radiation pressure is strong enough . there are critical densities of the cas governing its thermal states in light of the cooling and heating .",
    "we discuss the case with @xmath24 and @xmath164 to illustrate the evolution of the cas .    during phase",
    "i , the cas receives gas through thermal diffusion from the sf disk and is cooled mainly by the compton cooling until the cas density is high enough so that line cooling dominates in the formed clouds . during phase",
    "i , the largest size of a perturbation can not exceed the vertical height of the cas given by equation ( 15 ) for a thermal instability which developes as described below by equation ( 57 ) .",
    "this gives a lower limit of the cas density as @xmath165 .",
    "however , cold clouds can not be formed because their collapse timescale will be much longer than the cooling timescale , and so the thermal perturbation is removed by the dynamics ( see equation 59 , below )",
    ". therefore , pure accumulation without formation of clouds happens in phase i. accumulation continues until clouds form , and the cas enters phase ii .",
    "this transition from phase i to ii is determined by the time at which line cooling in clouds dominates the compton cooling .",
    "the compton cooling function is given by @xmath166 .",
    "when the cas density exceeds @xmath167 , for a plasma with temperature @xmath168 k , the cas begins to form clouds . with @xmath169 from figure [ hc ] , we have @xmath170 the total mass of the cas is given by the integration over the entire cas .",
    "we have @xmath171 where @xmath96 is the outer boundary of the blr , and the time is roughly given by @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the diffusion rate given by equation ( 3 ) . during phase ii ,",
    "once clouds have formed , they will spiral down to the sf disk with a sink velocity estimated by @xmath174 , where @xmath151 is the keplerian rotation velocity .",
    "this estimate is based on fact that the cloud motions are mainly controlled by the vertical gravity of the smbh .",
    "we have the sink timescale @xmath175 , which is just the keplerian one .",
    "there will be a dynamical interaction due to the velocity difference between the clouds and the cas .",
    "this eventually can destroy the clouds and return their material to the cas , constituting a mass cycle .",
    "the destruction timescale is given by @xmath176 sec , where @xmath177 is the velocity difference ( krolik 1988 ) .",
    "setting @xmath178 , we have @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the column density of clouds .",
    "ferland et al .",
    "( 2009 ) show that the typical column density of clouds is of order @xmath181 .",
    "we then have , at the point where the cloud destruction takes over and mass cycling begins , the cas mass @xmath182 corresponding to the time @xmath183 @xmath184 since the formation of cold clouds decreases the gas pressure in the cas , @xmath185 drives the continuous injection into the cas , entering phase iii .",
    "however , the start of the mass cycle between the clouds and the compton gas in the cas will cause an increase in the gas pressure in the cas .",
    "the cas reaches a steady state with a balance between production and destruction of clouds , entering phase iii .",
    "once mass begins cycling back and forth between the clouds and the cas , there is no longer a loss of gas back onto the sf disk , and the cas density will increase more rapidly in response to the injection from the sf disk .",
    "this increase will eventually cause the cas to enter phase iv , where rather than compton cooling the entire cas is cooling mainly through emission lines from h - like fe ions .",
    "in such a case , the cooling function is approximated by @xmath186 , where @xmath187 and @xmath92k . setting @xmath188 , we have as the critical density for the start of phase iv ( the collapse phase ) @xmath189 with a scale height of @xmath190 given by equation ( 15 ) .",
    "the corresponding mass is roughly obtained through integrating the regions with the density profile ( equation 27 ) , giving @xmath191 and the time is roughly @xmath192 since the entire cas is cooling with a timescale ( see equation 62 ) much shorter than the injection timescale , a direct collapse of the cas including the clouds is inevitable within timescale @xmath193 following such a collapse , the continued injection from the sf disk drives the blr to undergo episodic reappearances during the agn lifetime .    in figure",
    "[ phase]_b _ we compare the sf disk pressure with the cas pressure during phases i - iii .",
    "we use @xmath194 for the three phases , respectively .",
    "the metallicity appearing in the critical density is given by the results in w11 .",
    "we find that the sf disk pressure is always higher than the cas pressure .",
    "this simply indicates that the sf disk continuously injects material into the cas .",
    "this is a necessary condition for the episodic appearance of the blr . on the other hand ,",
    "the injection timescale is much longer than the dynamical timescale , allowing us to approximate the cas by a static state at any time except during phase iv .",
    "it is interesting to find that the accumulated mass of the blr agrees well with the observational estimates given above in  2.4 .",

    "the estimates based on the observed emission line strengths are of order @xmath133 and @xmath197 .",
    "this provides independent support for the present model of the blr formation .",
    "we find that the maximum cas mass is very sensitive to the smbh mass , but also to the eddington ratio , implying the dependence of the blr mass on the smbh mass and accretion rate through the star formation rate . for narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies with @xmath198",

    "the phase i cas emits @xmath200 and the thompson scattering depth is @xmath201 . this soft x - ray emission can be totally neglected compared with the bolometric luminosity . we should point out that most of the injected mass @xmath202 will be rapidly converted into clouds after phase i , but",
    "the cas gas will emit soft x - rays during the formation of clouds . in phase ii , the injected mass is efficiently converted into clouds , and the luminosity from the cas cooling is given by @xmath203 .",

    "we note that the continuous injection could be stopped if pressure of the compton atmosphere is higher than the pressure of the hot gas in the star forming disk .",

    "basic results from these studies show that a two - phase medium will be formed through the thermal instability .",
    "however , most of results do not directly apply to the present case because the authors did not include the role of the angular momentum of the gas that is undergoing the thermal instability .",
    "this plays a key role in determining the geometry of the resulting blr .",
    "furthermore all these studies neglect the role of metallicity in the condensation of the clouds .",

    "this gives the lower limit of the cas density for cloud formation .",
    "once thermal instability is triggered , the perturbed gas will undergo contraction until clouds finally form and then maintain a pressure balance with their surrounding medium .",
    "these processes are very complicated ( see the review by meerson 1996 ; or recent papers of iwasaki & tsuribe 2008 ; 2009 , but which only deal with a one - dimensional medium ) .",
    "krolik ( 1988 ) investigated cloud formation in an inflow and outflow under the condition of broken radiative equilibrium , where the convergence or divergence of the inflows and outflows enhance or diminish the cooling in clouds , giving rise to only algebraic growth of clouds rather than exponential .",
    "the present cas is in static equilibrium , so the context of cloud formation is different from the case described by krolik ( 1988 ) .",
    "clouds are born swirling around in the cas .",
    "the initial phase of contraction is driven by the free - free cooling on a timescale of @xmath316 we find that this timescale is still smaller than the keplerian one , @xmath317 yr . due to the high metallicity ,",

    "we then have as the formation timescale of cold clouds @xmath322 which is much shorter than the diffusion time of the compton gas and the keplerian rotation period .    following onset of the thermal instability , cold clouds form in the timescale given by equation ( 62 ) , within one keplerian rotation .",
    "this allows us to reasonably assume that the cold clouds have the same angular momentum as gas diffused from the sf disk since the specific angular momentum of the gas approximately remains constant ( neglecting the radiation pressure for the compton gas ) .",
    "the temperature of cold clouds can be determined from the new thermal equilibrium condition @xmath323 , while density can be determined from the pressure equilibrium with the cas as given by @xmath324 , yielding @xmath325 and @xmath326k .",

    "the evolution of clouds depends on the metallicity of the clouds .",
    "here we neglect the dependence of the line cooling and photoionization heating on the ionization parameter .",

    "future papers in this series will treat the clouds in a more self - consistent manner using photoionization models , and will study the dependence of cloud properties on the metallicity .",

    "right ) we plot the potential correlation of ew ( ) with the ionizing luminosity .",
    "the non - correlation between the two directly shows that the maximum is not caused by the flux - limit effects .",
    "we would like to stress that the clouds are optically thin for  photons , making  ew a robust indicator of the covering factor .",
    "the maximum  ew indicates the last stage ( phase iv ) of the transient blr .",
    "the cloud outflows which we predict will be ejected from blr - i by radiation pressure have the important implications that the clouds may undergo expansion and become highly ionized gas ( hig ) , which produces many features in x - rays . although absorption features due to hig were first clearly seen in agn with _ rosat _ ( turner et al . 1993 ) ,",
    "most of the fundamental physical properties of this component remain a matter for debate .",
    "the hig appears as absorption lines , such as ( 0.74kev ) and ( 0.87kev ) in type i agns ( reynolds 1997 , george et al .",
    "1998 , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) whereas it is seen as emission lines in type 2 agns ( turner et al . 1997 , netzer et al .",
    "the hig is variously suggested to be intrinsically related with blr clouds ( reynolds & fabian 1995 ) , or to have evaporated off  bloated stars \" ( netzer 1996 ) , or to be gas evaporated off the dusty torus obscuring the nucleus ( krolik & kriss 1995 ) , or to be a wind driven off the accretion disk ( bottorff et al . 2000 ) . in at least one object , mr 2251 - 178 , the general characteristics of the uv and x - ray absorbers are consistent with them having originated in the same gas ( kaspi et al .",
    "a brief summary is given by risaliti ( 2010 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the radiatively accelerated hil clouds predicted by our model is worth investigating to see if these clouds really can be the progenitors of the observed hig , and it will be very important to determine the metallicity of the hig through x - ray spectroscopy",
    ". future work on the comparison of warm absorbers with the properties of clouds in the hil blr is also well worth carrying out to examine the prediction of the present model through the observational tests of ultraviolet absorption lines with x - ray absorption .",
    "furthermore , we find a strong correlation between the blr and nlr metallicity in a sample of quasars observed with _ hst _ ( wang et al .",
    "2011 in preparation ) .",
    "this lends strong support to there being a connection between these two regions , even though they are separated by the large spatial distance of @xmath471kpc .",
    "another firm prediction of our model is that the hil lines ( blr - i ) will have higher metallicity than the lil lines ( blr - ii ) .",
    "metallicity in quasars can be estimated by measuring the n / c and n / o abundance ratio by using the , and  methods described by hamann & ferland ( 1999 ) , hamann et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and baldwin et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "as we have discussed in paper i , the expected differences may have already been found , with @xmath472 from the stacked spectra ( warner et al .",
    "additional checks of these results are badly needed .",
    "finally , future reverberation mapping of the agns that are thought to represent different phases in our model could provide observational tests of the model(like denney et al . 2009 ; 2010 ) .",
    "the self - gravitating part of the accretion disk has been regarded as a likely source of the blr for a quite long time ( e.g. collin & hure 2001 ; bian & zhao 2002 ) .",
    "the argument is favored by the fact that the self - gravitation radius is about the same as the reverberation mapping radius .",
    "our results are also generally compatible with the well - known result from reverberation mapping that the hil lines are formed at smaller radii and the lil lines at larger radii ( peterson & wandel 1999 ) , but a detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "mont - carlo simulations of the reverberation mapping relation will be carried out in a separate paper .",
    "-9 cm    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ blr_model ]",
    "it is generally thought that blrs are composed of a two - phase medium ( krolik et al .",
    "properties of photoionized cold clouds formed through thermal instability can be predicted and generally agree with observations . but key issues have long remained in doubt .",
    "these include the origin of the hot - phase gas , the evolution of the hot gas and also of the cold blr clouds , and the geometry of the blr .",
    "the present model makes clear predictions about the properties of the blr and clouds , which are testable from observations .",
    "we now make a brief comparison of the present model with previously existing ones .",
    "table [ blr_model ] lists existing models of the blrs .",
    "we divided them into five types in light of their main features .",
    "they are : 1 ) model type a employs the outer part of the accretion disk , which is irradiated by the central part ; 2 ) model type b deals with outflows which are approximately parallel to the surface of the accretion disk ; 3 ) model type c invokes clouds bound by magnetic fields which are poloidal perpendicular to the disk ; 4 ) model type d employs gas stirred by stars in a central cluster ; 5 ) model type e uses bloated stars ; and 6 ) model type f deals with supernova explosions .",
    "we briefly compare them with the present model .",
    "first of all , _ all _ models of types a - e are neither able to specify how the blr gas originates , nor connect the metallicity in the blr with feeding the smbh .",
    "model a employs the outer part of the accretion disk ( e.g. collin - souffrin 1987 ) , which is irradiated by the central engine .",
    "clouds may be formed in the outer region of the accretion disk , but the origin of the high metallicity in the blr remains open .",
    "these models could explain the dependence of the blr on the accretion rates , but the detailed relationship with the accretion disk is highly uncertain .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of non - blr agns with normal eddington ratios ( i.e. the panda agns ) strongly challenges model a and also the improved suggestions of gu & huang ( 2002 ) , nicastro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and elitzur & ho ( 2009 ) . the same is true with models of type b and c. interaction between stars and the accretion disk has been employed by model d in artymowicz et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and zurek et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and leads to production of metals . however , these models do not attempt to explain the establishments of the blr geometry or the dynamics of clouds .",
    "model e invokes bloated stars , but it is hard to explain a clear trend relating metallicity and luminosity of agns . in particular , there is no space for the huge size of the bloated stars ( laor et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "second , properties of clouds in the models a - f are only deduced from the necessary conditions for photoionzation in light of the cooling and heating function or from observed features .",
    "the present model is capable of predicting cloud properties , dynamics of clouds and how they evolve .",
    "this is the advantage .",
    "in addition , these are stationary models of the blr clouds , with very short lifetimes against destruction through dynamical friction with their surroundings .",
    "the existing models at best assume some motion of clouds around the smbh in order to predict the line profiles ( e.g. netzer & marziani 2010 ) .",
    "in contrast to these previous models , the present model predicts the details of the blr s evolution with time , giving rise to the episodic appearance and reappearance of blrs during the agn lifetime .",
    "the dynamics of clouds are fully predicted , and are different in phases ii and iii .",
    "the dynamical destruction of clouds is explicitly followed and plays a key role in driving the evolution .",
    "third , in our model the blr geometry and dynamics are both fully predicted .",
    "they are naturally derived from the dynamics of the cas , the birthplace of the clouds , the spatial distribution of blr clouds follows the cas density profile , but also the initial angular momentum of clouds tracks the rotation of the cas .",
    "the cas properties in turn follow predictably from the properties of the sf disk . in most other models",
    "the geometry is not known , so can not be tested .",
    "we have not yet carried out the numerical simulation of the reverberation mapping relation for the present model , but that needs to be done in the future and compared in detail with observations .",
    "fourth , the present model suggests the hil regions could develop outflows through enhanced radiation pressure and predict a potential connection between the blr and the nlr . as a consequence of the connection",
    ", the outflowing clouds could evolve into warm absorbers appearing in soft x - ray bands .",
    "we expect an intrinsic relation between high ionization lines and the warmer absorbers .",
    "outflowing clouds are also employed in other models to explain the blrs .",
    "spherical outflows ( beltrametti 1981 ) and ascending winds from the accretion disks ( shlosman et al .",
    "1985 ) have been investigated .",
    "emmering et al .",
    "( 1992 ) studied magnetized outflows perpendicular to the disk whereas murray & chiang ( 1995 ) and chiang & murray ( 1996 ) considered flows parallel to the disk .",
    "though these outflow models can generally generate the profiles of broad emission lines , the geometry is neither certain , nor do they incorporate the stratified structure of the blrs .",
    "the advantages of the present model can be summarized as follows :    * the model suggests that blr formation is a by - product of feeding smbhs . without supernova explosions driving outward transportation of angular momentum , neither accretion onto the smbh nor blr formation are able to proceed .",
    "this leads to a natural relationship between high metallicity and accretion onto the smbh .",
    "* cold clouds are produced in an evolving compton gas originated from the star forming disk , avoiding the crisis of the dynamical destruction of clouds , which has not been solved in the classical model .",
    "on the contrary , the episodic appearance of the blr employs the dynamical destruction of clouds , which is a necessary element in the present model . *",
    "the geometry and dynamics of clouds follows the compton gas .",
    "the blr is naturally divided into the low and high ionization regions related with different phenomena of emission lines .",
    "outflows from the hil regions bridge the blr and narrow line regions separated by 5 orders in size scale . *",
    "the model predicts a new kind of agns , which have higher eddington ratio , but do _ not _ have blrs .",
    "this enriches the classes of known agns . *",
    "the model predicts a metallicity gradient between high and low ionization line regions .",
    "this is one of the main characteristics of the present model .",
    "the present model has further implications to observations beyond the scope of blrs as a by - product of feeding the smbhs .",
    "the fact that the blrs emit more energy than they received from uv and x - rays , which is known as  energy budget problem \" ( collin - souffrin 1986 ; netzer 1990 ) could be explained by supplementing the uv emission with light from the massive stars in the star forming disk provided the star formation rates are high enough ( see  6.2 ) .",
    "if this is true , quasars with the energy budget problem ( netzer 1985 ) should have higher star formation rates , and hence higher metallicity .",
    "this possibility should be explored .    in this paper , we show that broad line regions are formed as a consequence of the accretion flow onto the smbhs . since the evolving blrs are not stationary during the agn lifetime , the blr will be renewed in the next episode with a duty cycle of a few @xmath473yrs .",
    "the smbh activities are composed of : 1 ) blr episodes and 2 ) agn episodes .",
    "this indicates that the blrs will have similar properties in low- and high - high redshift quasars .",
    "there is no measurable cosmological evolution of spectral energy distribution ( brandt et al .",
    "2007 ) or of metallicity ( hamnann & ferland 1993 ; warner et al . 2004",
    "; shemmer et al . 2004 ; matsuoka et al . 2011 ) . also as relics of smbh activities , stellar rings / belts and eventually nuclear compact star clusters ( wang et al .",
    "2010 ) should be produced during random accretion onto smbhs ( king & pringle 2007 ) as evidenced by the results from @xmath474equation of smbh spins ( wang et al .",
    "a future paper will provide a global explanation of fueling smbh , blrs , metallicity , nuclear compact star cluster and evolution of smbh as they spin down .",
    "first of all , we approximate the compton gas as barotropic gas in a quasi - steady state for discussion of the thermal instability of the compton gas .",
    "this approximation holds provided the supplying timescale is longer than the thermal instability timescale .",
    "the present model should be improved for some special cases with fast injection from the sf disk .",
    "we simply discuss the fate of the compton gas with several critical densities .",
    "we neglect the detailed contraction of clouds .",
    "second , we do not discuss the detailed dynamics of clouds after their formation from the compton gas .",
    "for simplicity , we simplify their motion to be a spiral path down to the sf disk with the initial angular momentum of their birth .",
    "this is important for profiles from the bound clouds in blrs .",
    "third , the dynamics of outflowing clouds is not discussed with regard to the connection between the blr and nlr .",
    "we plan to investigate the evolution of the outflowing clouds in a self - consistent way , including expansion , involving the swept medium and metallicity mixture , for the connection between the blr and the nlr .",
    "these processes should produce multiwavelength features .",
    "warm absorbers in x - rays should somehow be linked with the clouds in blr - i .",
    "this could be examined by comparing the properties of uv profiles with the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "one may ask about two other potential energy sources for heating the cas . the first is self - heating when the cas is accreted , through viscosity resembling the @xmath475prescription . this is similar to the case studied by meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1994 ) . the energy flux due to the viscosity",
    "is given by @xmath476 , where @xmath477 is the accretion rates of the cas onto the smbh .",
    "the energy flux from the central engine reads @xmath478 .",
    "we have @xmath479 .",
    "however , the leakage of the cas gas through accretion would play an important role in the evolution of the cas .",
    "actually the accretion rate in the cas is much less than the injection rate from the sf disk .",
    "this guarantees the results presented in this paper .",
    "the second possible additional energy source is radiation from the star - forming disk .",
    "the energy flux from the sf disk is @xmath480 , where @xmath481 for a salpeter initial mass function ( thompson et al . 2005 ) and @xmath482 is the surface density of the star formation rate .",
    "we have @xmath483 if @xmath484 and @xmath485 .",
    "so this energy supply to the cas could be important in some cases . especially , its contribution may change the compton temperature , but this depends on its sed ( e.g. sirko & goodman 2003 ) .",
    "future work should include the leakage of the cas mass through accretion onto the smbh and the heating of the sf disk itself .",
    "accurate cooling functions should be used to determine the new thermal equilibrium to obtain the final column density and then the dynamics of clouds in the radiation fields .",
    "furthermore , we may , in principle , include other heating mechanism discussed in krolik et al .",
    "the dynamics of the clouds should be specified more completely by including the friction due to the cas , radiation pressure , and even evaporation of clouds and condensations .",
    "this will allow us to study the detailed processes of the evolution of clouds .",
    "composite spectra from the assembly clouds in the blrs should be created by adding all the spectra from every individual clouds ( ferland & baldwin 1999 ) .",
    "line profiles from such a complicated model will be calculated in light of the cloud s dynamics .",
    "clouds in lil regions only have one orbital lifetime in phase ii , and an even shorter lifetime in phase iii .",
    "this complicates the calculations of the line profiles , as compared to the scheme used by netzer & marziani ( 2010 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping of broad emission line regions given in this paper should be done in future .",
    "we will carry out these results in a separate paper .",
    "the present model will also need modifications to be able to properly describe those low luminosity agns which lack blrs . for a very low accretion rate",
    ", the sf disk will be so thin that the snexp will break out and develop strong expansion outside of the disk .",
    "the central engines of these low - luminosity objects are expected to develop advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) with winds that will collide with the supernovae winds , producing significant @xmath486ray emission .",
    "such objects should manifest themselves as low ionization emission line regions ( liners )",
    ". the predicted @xmath486rays may be observable with _ fermi _ or _",
    "hess_. a detailed model for this scenario will be developed separately .",
    "we have developed a model that describes the way in which a star - forming region in the outer parts of an agn accretion disk ( beyond the self - gravitation radius ) will quite naturally , just as an inevitable result of the accretion process , lead to a two - component broad emission line region .",
    "we have shown that the blr should appear , disappear , and then reappear in a continuing series of episodes . within each episode",
    ", the blr will progress through an evolutionary cycle consisting of four phases .",
    "this will lead to an observable sequence of quasar broad emission line spectral types , with predictable characteristics .",
    "we have briefly tested these predictions against observations .",
    "this episodic model for the blr predicts : 1 ) the observed result that @xmath487 of sdss quasars show systematic redshifts correlated with the eddington ratios whereas about @xmath488 quasars show overlapping profiles of intermediate and broad components ; 2 ) a new class of bright type ii agns without broad emission lines and with high eddington ratios ; 3 ) an intrinsic connection of broad and narrow line regions through the outflows developed from the high ionization regions ; and 4 ) a significant difference of metallicity between the high and low ionization regions .",
    "we have described mostly - published observational evidence suggesting that each of these predictions is correct .",
    "the broad line regions are naturally divided into high- and low - ionization ( hil and lil ) regions .",
    "the hil region is characterized by outflows .",
    "the lil region has a mass circulation with the sf disk and , later , a mass cycle with the compton atmosphere in phase ii and iii , respectively .",
    "properties of clouds are self - consistently obtained from the model .",
    "an important advantage of the present model is that it employs clouds which are not in stationary states , avoiding the difficulties encountered by models in which dynamical destruction of the clouds must be prevented .",
    "the striking predictions of our model have been compared to sdss data in a preliminary way .",
    "further observational tests should in the future provide a more detailed test of this transient blr model .",
    "as we shown in figure 3 , the cas is not an isothermal atmosphere .",
    "however , it could be a good approximation , providing very simple results . in this appendix",
    ", we discuss the isothermal cas . for @xmath244 , equations ( 40 ) and ( 41 )",

    "it should be noted that the index @xmath238 in the development of thermal instability for an isothermal cas .",
    "the thermal instability of a rotating corona above a galactic disk has been studied by binney , nipoti & fraternali ( 2009 ) and nipoti ( 2010 ) , however the results of his analysis can not directly be scaled down to the blr case .",
    "following nipoti ( 2010 ) , the perturbation equations ( 48 - 52 ) give @xmath492 \\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\vr^1\\\\ \\vz^1\\\\ \\vphi^1\\\\ \\rho_1\\\\ p_1\\end{array}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath493 , @xmath494 and @xmath495 . here",
