    "the canonical function method ( cfm ) is a powerful means for solving the radial schrdinger equation ( rse ) , a singular boundary value problem ( sbvp ) with a stringent dual requirement of regularity near the origin ( @xmath0 ) where the potential is large and near infinity ( @xmath1 ) where the potential is very small .",
    "the cfm turns this sbvp into a regular initial value problem and allows full and accurate determination of the spectrum of the schrdinger operator .",
    "the cfm can handle bound states and scattering states , spinless and spin - dependent , single channel or multi - channel problems and possesses several features that makes it of interest for solving a large variety of problems in quantum mechanics of atoms , molecules and scattering .",
    "those capabilities are based essentially on the following main characteristics :    * its capability to transform a svbp into a regular initial value problem ( rivp ) , means mathematically that the cfm belongs to a family of invariant embedding methods ( iem ) .",
    "those essentially transform a boundary value problem into an initial value problem .",
    "the cfm is even more powerful than standard iem techniques since it turns the nature of the problem from singular to regular . * the evaluation of the schrdinger operator spectrum",
    "is done without performing diagonalization , bypassing the evaluation of the eigenfunctions .",
    "this allows to preserve a high degree of numerical precision that is required in solving sensitive eigenvalue problems arising in cold molecules or large @xmath2-limit problems where levels to evaluate are very close to the continuum limit or dissociation .",
    "the numerical precision gained with the bypass of intermediate digonalization operations is reminiscent of the golub - reinsch algorithm ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) used for the singular value decomposition of arbitrary rectangular matrices .",
    "this review is organised as follows : the next section is a description of the cfm with highlights of its mathematical aspects and its generalisation to the multichannel case . in section iii the mathematical and numerical techniques of the radial schrdinger equation are discussed and the full procedure for dealing with general potentials , energy levels and evaluation of phaseshifts is detailed in section iv . in the rest of the sections , we apply the cfm method systematically to a variety of problems highlighting its successes and showing its limitations whenever they show up . while , the versatility of the method is illustrated with the help of this selection of examples , the list below is by no means exhaustive but serves the purpose of underlining the breadth of applications of the cfm .    * energy levels for regular and singular potentials ( radial case ) * potential estimation ( in parametric or pseudo form ) from spectroscopic data * test of the bohr correspondence principle * vibrational energy levels of cold molecules and application to the @xmath3 molecule in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 electronic states",
    ". the lennard - jones molecule case is also studied .",
    "* local and non - local exchange problems . *",
    "accurate phase shift evaluation for regular and singular potentials .    in the last section before the conclusion , we treat the general but non obvious ( regular and singular ) 1d potentials to illustrate how the method can be applied in this case of lesser interest than the 3d s .    in the appendix we provide information linking the various units used since the review contains results spanning several fields of physics where different systems of units are used .",
    "the boundary conditions affecting the spectrum determination via the matching conditions at a single radial point are also discussed in the appendix .",
    "the cfm @xcite is a powerful means for solving the radial schrdinger equation ( rse ) .",
    "the mathematical difficulty of the rse lies in the fact it is a singular boundary value problem .",
    "the cfm turns it into a regular initial value problem and allows the full determination of the spectrum of the schrdinger operator bypassing the evaluation of the eigenfunctions .",
    "+ the partial wave form of the rse is written as :          the cfm developed initially by kobeissi @xcite and his coworkers to integrate the rse , consists of writing the general solution @xmath12 representing the probability amplitude @xmath8 as a function of the radial distance @xmath13 in terms of two basis functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 for some energy @xmath10 .",
    "+ generally , the rse is rewritten in a system of units such that @xmath16 ( see appendix on units ) : @xmath17 y(r )   \\label{schro}\\ ] ] at a selected distance @xmath18 , a well defined set of initial conditions are satisfied by the canonical functions and their derivatives ie : @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 . thus we write :      the method of solving the rse is to proceed from @xmath18 simultaneously towards the origin ( @xmath24 ) and towards infinity ( @xmath1 ) . expressing the continuity condition of the `` wavefunction '' @xmath12 and its derivative @xmath25 at the point @xmath18 from the left ( @xmath24 ) and right ( @xmath1 ) yields ( see appendix on matching and boundary conditions ) :      when the integration is performed , the ratio of the @xmath13 dependent canonical functions is monitored until saturation with respect to @xmath13 is reached at both limits ( @xmath24 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the saturation of the @xmath27 ratio with @xmath13 yields a position independent eigenvalue function @xmath28 .",
    "+ the latter is mathematically defined with the help of two associated energy functions : @xmath29 and : @xmath30              with @xmath34 the radial coordinates where saturation is observed ( within some predefined tolerance ) respectively in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "an example of typical behaviour of @xmath28 is displayed in fig .",
    "the eigenfunctions may be obtained for any @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a zero of @xmath28 .",
    "+    the eigenvalue function definition depends on the type of boundary conditions at hand . in the appendix",
    "we describe the general boundary conditions case and the corresponding matching conditions along with the corresponding eigenvalue function .",
    "+ the @xmath39 shape of @xmath28 provides a deep insight into the physical significance of the cfm method .",
    "the latter transforms a sbvp from the open interval @xmath40 to the finite interval @xmath41 $ ] defined by the saturation coordinates of the energy functions .",
    "this means the cfm maps an arbitrary potential @xmath42 onto the infinite square well problem defined by @xmath43 in the open interval @xmath44r_{min } , r_{max}[$ ] and @xmath45 ( see section vii for additional information ) . in fact , for the infinite square well problem @xmath28 has a @xmath39 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the speed and accuracy of the cfm method have been tested and compared to standard integration algorithms such as the order four runge - kutta ( rk4 ) method , numerov etc .. in a variety of cases and for a wide of range of potentials .",
    "more specifically , @xmath18 being selected as the starting point for the integration , the @xmath13-axis is divided into intervals @xmath46 $ ] in a way such that the potential can be series expanded over @xmath47 ( see refs  @xcite ) . + the expansion uses coefficients @xmath48 so that the local expression of the total potential is defined as : @xmath49_{r \\in i_p}=   \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty } \\gamma_{n}^{(p ) } x^n , x \\in i_p\\ ] ]          where the @xmath52 are a particular set of canonical functions and the @xmath53 are their derivatives in the interval @xmath54 $ ] . the @xmath55",

    "[ schro ] : @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    in practice ,",
    "the above sums over @xmath2 are truncated to a cutoff value @xmath59 ( instead of @xmath60 ) chosen large enough so that the remainder error is less than a selected truncation error @xmath61 .",
    "+ given @xmath59 and @xmath61 , the integration step @xmath62 for the interval @xmath54 $ ] is deduced from @xmath63 .",
    "+ at the starting point of integration @xmath18 , the starting step size @xmath64 is thus determined , and the procedure is repeated at @xmath65 leading to @xmath66 and so forth until we reach @xmath67 after @xmath68 steps .",
    "+ these equations allow the propagation of the solution from one point to the next using a variable step and a local series expansion of variable order controlled by the truncation error @xmath61 .",
    "the accuracy of the results are monitored with respect to the decrease of @xmath69 and the procedure is referred to as the vsca ( variable step with controlled accuracy ) method .",
    "generally , one avoids using or evaluating the radial wavefunction but if one insists on evaluating it , the canonical functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are used to determine the radial wavefunction at any energy via the expression :        before proceeding any further , the essential test of any method that pretends solving the rse is the coulomb potential and the essential case to test the accuracy and reliability of the cfm is the ( textbook ) hydrogen atom .",
