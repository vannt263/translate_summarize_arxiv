    "tight dynamical bounds on the graviton mass can be obtained using gw observations in space .",
    "this is due to two reasons : ( 1 ) the larger mass of observable bh binaries , as compared to ground - based gw observations ; ( 2 ) the statistical increase in the bound that would result from observing _",
    "populations _ of individually resolved binaries .",
    "to illustrate point ( 1 ) , in this section we review existing work on massive graviton bounds from gw observations of individual binaries with lisa . in section [ sec :",
    "pops ] we will present the first attempt to quantify the statistical improvement of bounds on @xmath5 that could be achievable in reality by observing several events in the context of hierarchical models of massive bh formation .",
    "will @xcite first pointed out that interesting bounds on @xmath5 could come from a careful monitoring of the phase of gws emitted by binaries of compact objects , such as bhs and/or neutron stars . in hypothetical massive graviton theories , the gw damping formulae and dispersion relation",
    "would be modified . as a consequence ,",
    "the gw phasing @xmath23 would acquire an additional term : _ mg(f)=_gr(f)- _",
    "g ( mf)^-1 , where @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 is a distance parameter , similar to ( but not quite the same as ) the luminosity distance @xmath26 ( here and below we assume a @xmath27cdm model with @xmath28 km@xmath29s@xmath30mpc@xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .    using the restricted post - newtonian approximation and neglecting binary spins , will estimated that stellar - mass binary inspirals to be observed with ligo would yield a bound @xmath33  km , only slightly better than solar system bounds .",
    "for an `` optimal '' lisa system , i.e. an equal - mass bh binary of total mass @xmath34 at @xmath35  gpc ( @xmath36 ) , the bound would be four orders of magnitude better : @xmath37 .",
    "these initial estimates were refined in various papers .",
    "will and yunes @xcite showed that bounds from binary bh inspirals at @xmath35  gpc would range between @xmath38  km and @xmath39  km for @xmath11 in the range @xmath40 .",
    "they found that the bound on @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the lisa armlength ) and to ( lisa acceleration noise)@xmath43 , and that it scales in the following way : _",
    "g()^1/2 , where @xmath44 is the `` chirp mass '' , @xmath45 ( in hz@xmath30 ) sets the scale of the noise power spectral density ( psd ) of the detector , and @xmath46 is a characteristic `` knee '' frequency where the psd has a minimum .",
    "distance dependence is weak because the effect of the massive graviton and measurement errors both grow with distance .",
    "berti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a more detailed monte carlo calculation of lisa s parameter estimation capabilities .",
    "they still considered restricted post - newtonian inspiral waveforms , but they used cutler s model @xcite to take into account the motion of the detector ( all previous analyses assumed a _ static _",
    "lisa constellation ) . in this paper",
    "we will do the same . in cutler s model , lisa",
    "can be seen as one ( two ) independent `` ligo - like '' michelson interferometers depending on whether 4 ( 5/6 , respectively ) laser links are available between the three satellites forming the constellation . for the `` optimal binary '' ( a nonspinning , equal - mass binary with @xmath34 at @xmath47gpc ) , monte carlo averages over the binary position and orientation yield a bound @xmath48  km when using two ( one ) michelsons , in excellent agreement with will s original results . for masses in the range @xmath49 , the mean bound using two michelsons at @xmath47gpc is in the range @xmath50  km . later work used mostly cutler s model and investigated the effect of more complex inspiral waveforms .",
    "arun and will @xcite studied the effect of higher harmonics and pn amplitude corrections .",
    "they found that bounds on @xmath5 improve by a factor of a few for systems of total mass @xmath51 , and that this improvement is more significant for binaries with large mass ratios . if one ignores spin precession , adding spins to the waveforms generally introduces degeneracies between the binary parameters , degrading parameter estimation accuracy @xcite .",
    "stavridis and will @xcite showed that modulations induced by spin precession can break these degeneracies .",
    "for the `` optimal binary '' , for example , the average bound including spin precession is @xmath52  km , basically the same as in the case of nonspinning binaries .",
    "yagi and tanaka @xcite included _ both _ spin precession and eccentricity . performing simulations for a @xmath53 binary at 3  gpc",
    ", they found an average bound @xmath54  km .",
    "this is again consistent with @xcite to within a factor 2 .",
    "more recently , keppel and ajith @xcite revisited this problem using phenomenological waveforms for nonspinning bh binaries that include the merger / ringdown phase .",
    "their analysis of lisa bounds is similar to the original work by will @xcite in that it ignores the motion of the detector , using an effective non - sky - averaged noise psd .",
    "this simplification should not affect their main conclusions : ( i ) for the `` optimal binary '' , the bound on @xmath5 _ improves by about one order of magnitude _",
    ", up to @xmath55  km ; ( ii ) a comparable bound is obtained also for binaries of larger mass , up to @xmath56 . at @xmath35  gpc ,",

    "in this study we consider quasicircular , nonspinning , restricted post - newtonian inspiral waveforms .",

    "we take into account weak lensing errors on the redshift following @xcite , and we compute the individual graviton mass bounds by generalizing the fisher matrix formalism described in @xcite , which takes into account correlations with the other waveform parameters .",

    "@xcite suggest that our bounds will be ( i ) very close to the bounds we would obtain for spinning , precessing inspirals , and ( ii ) about one order of magnitude worse than the bounds achievable if we used `` full '' merger waveforms .",
