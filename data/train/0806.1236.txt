    "we study a model of monotone non - intersecting lattice paths in @xmath13 .",
    "while this is a classically studied model in statistical mechanics , related to dyson brownian motion and random matrices , there are few studies concerned with the influence of the boundary conditions at the critical point of the model .",
    "the authors of @xcite studied a similar model in this setting , finding some surprising `` resonance '' phenomena , which showed how the shape of the domain  in particular the rationality of the aspect ratio  had a strong influence on the partition function and other observables in the model . here",
    "we study a model very closely related to that in @xcite , on which we can obtain more accurate and complete information using simple probabilistic methods .",
    "one of our goals is to explain some of the conjectured behavior in @xcite .",
    "however we feel that our model is of primary interest as an example of a quenched random dynamical system for which a fairly complete analysis can be obtained .    for positive integers @xmath14 let @xmath15 be the sublattice of @xmath16 generated by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 , the @xmath20-torus .",
    "we will consider configurations consisting of collections of vertex - disjoint monotone lattice cycles on @xmath21 .",
    "the law on such configurations that we consider has two simple definitions .",
    "firstly , we define @xmath22 by setting @xmath23 to be equal , with equal probability , either to @xmath24 or @xmath3 , these choices being made independently over the @xmath25 vertices of @xmath21 .",
    "we call @xmath6 a * quenched random walk*. each @xmath6 represents a dynamical system , with at least one periodic orbit",
    ". the law on disjoint unions of cycles that we consider is given by the collection of distinct orbits of this randomly selected @xmath6 .",
    "the dynamical system @xmath6 is equivalent to another model , the * cycle - rooted spanning forest*. we may make @xmath21 into a directed graph , with each vertex @xmath26 having two outgoing edges , that point to @xmath24 and @xmath3 . a cycle - rooted spanning forest is a subgraph in which each vertex has one outgoing edge . the components in these subgraphs may be several , but each component contains a single directed cycle , which is topologically nontrivial .",
    "the remaining edges of the component form in - directed trees , attached to this cycle .",
    "the uniform probability measure on cycle - rooted spanning forests is called the crsf measure , @xmath27 .",
    "each component is referred to as a cycle - rooted spanning tree .",
    "see figure [ cycles ] .",
    "it is not hard to see that the cycles of the quenched random walk @xmath6 are precisely the cycles in the crsf model .",
    "we simply define @xmath23 to be the vertex pointed to by the random outgoing edge from @xmath26 in the crsf .",
    "the model is closely related to the monotone non - intersecting lattice path ( mnlp ) model , which was studied in @xcite .",
    "the state space of the measure again consists of collections of disjoint , monotone northeast - going lattice cycles .",
    "a given configuration is chosen according to a boltzmann measure @xmath28 at temperature @xmath29 , which is the probability measure assigning to a configuration a probability proportional to @xmath30 . here ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are positive constants , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the total number of eastgoing or northgoing steps in the configuration .    in @xcite ,",
    "the behaviour of the mnlp model was examined near its critical temperature @xmath29 , which is the temperature at which @xmath35 . in the critical case",
    ", a configuration is being chosen with probability proportional to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 satisfy @xmath38 .",
    "the two models , crsf and mnlp , have similarities in their definition , and we will shortly explain their connection more precisely .",
    "as @xcite showed , mnlp is amenable to an exact solution analysis using kasteleyn theory .",
    "the crsf model , on the other hand , has a dynamical definition that permits a more geometric discussion of its behaviour .",
    "the authors of @xcite determine that the behaviour of mnlp depends sensitively , for large tori , on the aspect ratio @xmath8 of the torus , with radical changes in behaviour occurring near rational values for this ratio .",
    "in theorem 1 of @xcite , for example , an asymptotic expression for the value of partition function ( whose definition we will shortly give ) , and for the mean and variance of the number of edges present in an mnlp configuration is computed .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite illustrates a conjecture of @xcite : the number of edges typically present in an mnlp configuration appears to be highly peaked when the aspect ratio is precisely equal to a given small rational , it experiences a rapid decay if the aspect ratio is slightly increased or decreased , and , strikingly , it increases again if the change in aspect ratio is further accentuated , while still remaining `` far '' from other rationals .",
    "consider the critical case of mnlp where @xmath39 ( we might consider other values of @xmath37 such that @xmath40 , but this is essentially indistinguishable , for asymptotic behaviour , from changing the aspect ratio of the torus ) . in this case",
    ", mnlp assigns a weight of @xmath41 to any configuration @xmath42 , a disjoint union of north- and east - going cycles , where @xmath43 is the total number of edges of @xmath42 .",
    "we define @xmath44 , where the sum is over all configurations , so that the probability of a configuration in @xmath45 .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is the * partition function * of the mnlp model .",
    "we now discuss the relation between the two models , mnlp and crsf .",
    "consider a variant of crsf , called oriented crsf , which is given by the uniform measure on cycle - rooted spanning forests , each of whose cycles is given an orientation ( either to the northeast , or the southwest ) .",
    "we can exhibit a measure - preserving correspondence between mnlp and oriented crsf .",
    "indeed , if we take a sample of mnlp , and orient each of its cycles in the southwesterly direction , and then assign to each remaining vertex in the torus an edge pointing to the east or to the north , indepedently and with equal probability , declaring that the newly formed cycles , if any , are to be oriented in the northeasterly direction , we claim that the resulting law is the uniform measure on oriented cycle - rooted spanning forests .",
    "we see this as follows : for a given cycle - rooted spanning forest whose cycles are oriented , the procedure will alight on this configuration if , firstly , the sample of mnlp happens to pick its set @xmath42 of southwesterly oriented cycles and , secondly , the correct choice of north or east outgoing edges is made in each of the remaining vertices .",
    "the probability of the first event is @xmath47 , while the second then occurs with probability @xmath48 .",
    "so the probability of obtaining the given oriented cycle - rooted spanning forest , which is @xmath49 , does indeed not depend on the choice of oriented crsf .",
    "this argument also demonstrates that the number of oriented crsfs is given by @xmath50 .",
    "we also know that it is equal to the sum over crsfs of @xmath51 , or to @xmath52 , since there a total of @xmath53 crsfs .",
    "we summarise these deductions :    [ mnlpthm ] the mnlp model is in measure - preserving correspondence with oriented crsf , and @xmath54 that is , the partition function for the mnlp model is the expected value of @xmath55 to the number of components in the crsf model .    in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that @xmath56 .",
    "this follows trivially from .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=51.0% ]    in this paper we study the number and the length of cycles in crsf , as well as their homology class .",
    "our results , which we shortly outline , yield a geometric understanding of crsf : the sharp changes in behaviour that occur near rational choices for the aspect ratio for a large torus , and the remaining generic case in which the aspect ratio is not close to any small rational . as well as treating this simple and natural model , our results also have implications for mnlp . a reweighting as in ( [ zequality ] ) is required to make inferences about mnlp , because our results treat the unoriented version of crsf .",
    "it is easily seen , however , that the number of cycles present in oriented and unoriented crsf differs by a constant factor , uniformly in @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this means that , for example , we have found a qualitative explanation for the secondary spikes present in the mean total length of cycles in mnlp near a given rational aspect ratio that is described in section 6 of @xcite .    .",

    "we refer to such an orbit as a * @xmath69-cycle*. two disjoint closed orbits necessarily have the same homology class , and @xmath72 are necessarily relatively prime , since the orbits are simple closed curves .",

    "a cycle is partitioned by the set of its strands .    for a particular realization of @xmath6 , and for @xmath84 , we write @xmath85 for the number of cycles of homology class @xmath69 , and @xmath86 for the total number ( note that exactly one term in the sum is nonzero ) .    for each @xmath87 ,",
    "associate a random walk @xmath88 , starting at @xmath89 and whose steps are independently up and to the right with equal probability .",

    "although in constructing the crsf , we have no cause to examine the walks after they intersect themselves , the independence properties of the walks without stopping will be useful in the proofs of the propositions .",
