    "magnetoelectronics or spintronics is a field of growing interest . since the discovery of giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) @xcite",
    ", rapid progress has been made in this field .",
    "electron spin injection and spin dependent transport are essential aspects of spintronics and have been extensively studied in a number of different contexts including : ferromagnetic metals to superconductors @xcite ; ferromagnetic metals to normal metals @xcite ; ferromagnetic metals to nonmagnetic semiconductors @xcite and magnetic semiconductors to nonmagnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "recently , spin polarized injection and spin polarized transport in conjugated polymers have been reported @xcite .",
    "specifically , spin injection was observed into thin films of the conjugated organic material sexithienyl from half - metallic manganites ( in which electron spins at the fermi surface are completely polarized ) at room temperature .",
    "the ease of fabrication and low temperature processing of conjugated organic materials open many application possibilities , and electronic as well as opto - electronic devices fabricated from these materials , e.g. organic light - emitting diodes and spin valves , are being actively pursued @xcite .",
    "theoretical study of spin polarized injection and transport has been carried out primarily in the framework of classical transport equations @xcite . the role of interface properties for spin injection in inorganic semiconductors",
    "was investigated in this context @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the ground state characteristics such as lattice displacements , charge density and spin density distribution of conjugated organic polymers contacted with a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "an added motivation to study this type of `` active '' interface is that because of relatively large electron - phonon coupling the materials on _ both _ sides of the interface can deform , which may facilitate spin polarized injection .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present tight - binding models for a nondegenerate conjugated polymer , a ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal , a half - metallic colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) material and the interface between the polymer and the two kinds of magnetic materials .",
    "section iii presents the results for a model junction between the polymer and the fm metal , and sec .",
    "iv describes results for cmr / polymer junctions .",
    "our main findings are summarized in sec .",
    "organic polymers currently used for electronic and opto - electronic devices typically have a nondegenerate ground state .",
    "the first experimental evidence of spin polarized electrical injection and transport in conjugated organic materials was carried out using sexithienyl ( t@xmath0 ) , a @xmath1-conjugated oligomer @xcite .",
    "the underlying physics of spin injection and transport is of particular interest for conjugated organic materials , where strong electron - phonon coupling leads to polaronic ( or bipolaronic ) charged states @xcite .",
    "these polymers or oligomers have chain structures that can be described using a nondegenerate version of the one - dimensional ssh model , the brazovskii - kirova ( bk ) model @xcite , @xmath2 ( a^+_{i,\\sigma}a_{i+1,\\sigma}+a^+_{i+1,\\sigma}a_{i,\\sigma})\\nonumber\\\\ + \\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{2}k_{p}(u_{i+1}-u_{i})^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) denotes the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath5 with spin @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the on - site electron energy of an atom , @xmath8 is the transfer integral in a uniform ( undimerized ) lattice and @xmath9 the electron - phonon interaction parameter , @xmath10 introduces nondegeneracy into the polymer , and @xmath11 denotes a spring constant .    to describe a conventional ferromagnetic metal",
    "we use a one - dimensional tight - binding model with kinetic energy ( @xmath12 ) and spin splitting ( @xmath13 ) terms : @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the transfer integral for a ferromagnetic metal and @xmath13 describes the spin splitting of the magnetic atom with site - dependent strength @xmath18 .",
    "we take an occupation of one electron per atom and @xmath19 with parameters @xmath20 ev and @xmath21 ev for the conventional ferromagnetic metal .",
    "cmr materials can form half - metallic ferromagnets and are therefore very interesting as spin polarized electron injecting contacts .",
    "cmr materials have a chemical composition such as re@xmath22ak@xmath23mno@xmath24 , where re represents a rare earth atom , e.g. la and nd , and ak represents an alkali metal such as ca , sr and ba .",
    "mn has a valence of ( @xmath25 ) which depends on the doping concentration @xmath26 .",
    "depending on doping , the material can be either a metal or an insulator and either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "in particular , re@xmath22ak@xmath23mno@xmath24 can be a half - metallic ferromagnet when @xmath27 , for example , with re = la and ak = ca . in this state",
    "all the electrons at the fermi surface have the same spin orientation .",
    "the mn atom has 5 electrons in its 3d orbitals .",
    "these electrons have a parallel spin alignment due to a strong hund s rule splitting .",
    "because of crystal field splitting in a solid , three of the orbitals form the low energy @xmath28 states , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the other two form the higher energy @xmath31 states , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the ground state , the electrons in @xmath28 are localized and constitute core spins .",

    "coupling at the interface between the conjugated polymer and the ferromagnetic metal is described by the hopping integral , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a weighting parameter . in principle , this coupling could be spin - dependent , but here we take @xmath47 for simplicity .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are adopted .",
    "the parameters used for the cmr contact re@xmath22ak@xmath23mno@xmath24 are @xmath20 ev , @xmath48 ev , @xmath49 ev / @xmath50 @xcite and @xmath51ev /  . for the organic polymer",

    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) we see that the displacements of both oxygen and manganese atoms depend on the electronic density at the manganese atoms .",
    "the structure and magnetism of re@xmath22ak@xmath23mno@xmath24 depend on the doping concentration @xmath26 which determines the electron number per manganese atom .",
    "the orbitals of each manganese atom have been renormalized to a single orbital in the present model and the electron number per manganese atom is denoted by @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "figure 1(@xmath76 ) shows the dependence of the energy difference per site between the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) states on @xmath74 . for an electronic doping concentration @xmath77 ( no electrons ) ,",
    "the fm and afm states have the same energy and the equilibrium conditions give @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , that is each manganese atom having one electron , the afm state is lower in energy than the fm state .",
    "an energy gap of 2.5 ev appears in the afm state for both the spin up and down energy levels .",
    "the lower subband levels are occupied and the system is an insulator . at @xmath80 , the fm state is lower in energy than the afm state . at this electron concentration ,",
    "the energy difference between fm and afm states is 0.127 ev per manganese atom . in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "1(@xmath81 ) , the energy bands of the fm state are totally spin split . there is a gap of 0.26 ev at the wavevector @xmath82 ( @xmath76 is the lattice constant between two nearest mn sites ) and the system is an insulator .",
    "this gap can be adjusted by changing @xmath43 . when @xmath83 ev /  , the gap is close to zero .",
    "all the spin down levels are empty and only the lower sublevels of the spin up band are occupied . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the charge density has an oscillatory distribution .",
    "for example , at @xmath84 ev /  , the densities on two adjacent manganese atoms are about 0.621@xmath85 and 0.379@xmath85 ( at @xmath80 ) .",
    "away from @xmath80 , the energy gap disappears and the system becomes a ferromagnetic half - metal . in the ferromagnetic state ,",
    "the sites displace in the approximate pattern , @xmath86,\\\\   u_{i}=u_{0}\\cos[2i(y-0.5)\\pi ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with electron concentration @xmath87 , the displacements of both mn and o atoms become very small ( @xmath88    and @xmath89  ) and decrease to zero when the chain length becomes arbitrarily long .",
    "that is , the system becomes uniform in this doping region , and correspondingly the charge density is also uniform with a half - metallic property .",
    "these results are consistent with the basic properties of the cmr materials @xcite and show that the one - dimensional model gives a reasonable description of them .",
    "we first consider a polymer chain contacted by a simple rigid ferromagnetic metal chain . in the case of half filling for the parameters used ,",
    "the spin polarization is @xmath90 the polymer has a one - dimensional chain structure with a strong electron - lattice interaction that will cause localized charged excitations . when the polymer is connected with a ferromagnetic metal , both the lattice configuration and charge distribution of the polymer are affected . by adjusting the relative chemical potential , electrons ( or holes ) are transferred into the polymer and cause the displacement of the lattice sites .",
    "results are shown in fig . 2 and fig . 3 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 ev , respectively .",
    "following the usual convention , in this paper the displacement is plotted with a multiplying factor @xmath93 , where @xmath5 is the site index .",
    "the ferromagnetic metal is to the left and the polymer is to the right of the interface which is between sites @xmath94=100 and 101 . in fig .",
    "2 , there is no electron transfer between the segments , and the charge density is uniform within the whole system .",
    "but the charges near the interface can be spin polarized .",
    "the polarization oscillates and decays into the polymer segment .",
    "the decay length of the spin polarization is about 6@xmath81 , where @xmath81 is the lattice constant in the polymer . if the chemical potential of the ferromagnet is higher than the bipolaron level in the polymer , as in fig .",
    "3 , electrons are transferred into the polymer segment to reach a new equilibrium for the system . instead of forming extended electronic waves , the extra electrons in the polymer form localized charged bipolarons .",
    "figure 3(@xmath76 ) shows the displacements of lattice sites , from which we see that , in this case , three complete bipolarons are formed within the polymer together with some local distortions at the interface . the corresponding charge and spin distributions are shown in fig .",
    "3(@xmath81 ) . in the present bk model for the nondegenerate polymer ,",
    "bipolarons are energetically lower than polarons . since each bipolaron has two confined electronic charges with opposite spins , a bipolaron has no spin .",
    "there is neither localized nor extended spin distribution within the polymer layer . because the polymer is nonmagnetic in the ground state , or more generally at thermal equilibrium , there is no spin distribution far from the interface .",
    "here , we consider the polymer chain in contact with a half - metallic ferromagnetic re@xmath22ak@xmath23mno@xmath24 chain with electron concentration @xmath95 . by adjusting the relative chemical potential ,",
    "electrons are transferred between the cmr material and polymer . at @xmath96",
    "ev , there is essentially no electron transfer between the segments . figure 4(@xmath76 )",
    "shows the displacements of the atoms ( mn , o and c ) compared to their uniform bulk positions . within the cmr segment , both the manganese and oxygen atoms are only slightly displaced .",
    "the small displacements are due to the finite length of the segment and disappear as the segment length is increased .",
    "the carbon atoms have a displacement of 0.05  , corresponding to the bulk dimerization of the polymer chain .",
    "the interfacial atoms have a deviation from the bulk dimerization , which results in a small expansion of the end bonds of the cmr segment and a contraction of the first few polymer bonds .",
    "the charge and spin densities are shown in fig .",
    "4(@xmath81 ) . because the cmr material is completely spin polarized . the charge and spin densities coincide in this segment .",
    "the distributions of charge and spin density in each segment are uniform except for a small modulation near the interface .",
    "the modulation in the cmr material is a finite size effect discussed previously .",
    "there is neither a net charge nor spin distribution within the bulk polymer .",
    "when we increase the chemical potential of the cmr material , electrons are transferred into the polymer .",
    "the results for @xmath97 ev are shown in fig .",
    "5 . at this value for the chemical potential ,",
    "6.11 electrons transfer to the polymer segment .",
    "the cmr segment keeps a nearly uniform lattice structure except a small deviation at the interface . in the polymer , from the displacements shown in fig .",
    "5(@xmath76 ) , bipolaron states form .",
    "the localized electronic density can be seen more clearly in fig .",
    "5(@xmath81 ) .",
    "because the transferred electrons form spinless bipolarons , there is no spin amplitude within the polymer segment .",
    "these results become more apparent if we examine the change in electronic density of states ( dos ) defined by the lorentz line shape formula @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a one - electron energy eigenvalue and @xmath100 a phenomenological lorentz line width , which we choose as @xmath100=0.15 ev .",
    "figure 6(@xmath76 ) shows the dos for the cmr / polymer chain before coupling of the two segments ( that is , for the two separate material segments ) and fig .",
    "6(@xmath81 ) shows the dos after coupling .",
    "the relative chemical potential was adjusted to be @xmath96 ev as in fig .",
    "4 so that there is no electron transfer between the cmr material and polymer after coupling . from the figure",
    "we see that there is still a large gap for the spin down states , but the gap for spin up states decreases after coupling .",
    "all the occupied states near the fermi level have spin up and these states are confined in the segment of the cmr material .",
    "increasing the relative chemical potential @xmath97 ev as in fig . 5 , we plot the dos before and after coupling in fig .",
    "7(@xmath76 ) and fig .",
    "7(@xmath81 ) , respectively . because the fermi level of the cmr is above the bipolaron level of the polymer , electrons transfer to the polymer after coupling .",
    "they form double - charged bipolarons .",
    "the bipolaron levels are indicated in fig .",
    "7(@xmath81 ) , where the levels of spin up and down states overlap ( the spin up states of the bipolaron near @xmath1012.5 ev can not be seen easily due to the large dos caused by the cmr material ) .",
    "thus , bipolarons have no spin .",
    "the difference in dos of spin up and down at the bipolaron states arises from the effect of the cmr material at the interface .",
    "organic ( @xmath1-conjugated ) polymers differ from traditional inorganic semiconductors due to their strong electron - lattice interactions .",
    "carriers in ( nondegenerate ) polymers are not typically electrons or holes but rather charged polarons or bipolarons . in this paper",
    "we have studied the ground state properties of a ferromagnetic metal / organic polymer junction .",
    "two kinds of magnetic contacts were considered , a simple ferromagnetic metal with fractional spin polarization and a cmr ferromagnet with a half - metallic ground state .",
    "it was found that the electric charges in the polymer near the interface can have spin polarization .",
    "the spin density decays in an oscillatory fashion into the polymer . by adjusting the relative chemical potential ,",
    "electrons can be transferred into the polymer from the magnetic layer through the interfacial coupling .",
    "the transferred electrons form bipolarons , which have no spin , so that there is no spin density in the bulk of the polymer .",
    "the polymer is nonmagnetic and in the ground state , or more generally at thermal equilibrium , there will not be a spin polarization in this material far from the interface .",
    "the present model is simple and only static characteristics were investigated .",
    "in addition , the model is one - dimensional and coulomb interactions between electrons were not included so that there was no schottky effect at the interface . but",
    "major factors have been included , such as lattice relaxation and interfacial coupling .",
    "the main motivation for this model came from recent polarized spin injection ( and spin - coherent transfer ) experiments on the conjugated organic oligomer sexithienyl ( thin film ) in which a half - metallic ferromagnetic cmr contact was used @xcite .",
    "this oligomer can serve as an active transport material for potential organic opto - electronic and spintronic devices .",
    "dynamics under external bias will be studied to describe spin injection and polarized spin transport in conjugated organic materials , but an understanding of ground state properties is required to initiate a study of such dynamics .",
