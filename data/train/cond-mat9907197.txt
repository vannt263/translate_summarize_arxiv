    "a large variety of problems in physics can be modeled in terms of a spin of large magnitude which is then described by a hamiltonian which is a polynomial in the spin components . it is natural in many of these cases to seek a semiclassical description",
    "this is especially so when the system possesses a number of degenerate states in the classical limit , and one wishes to see how this degeneracy is lifted by quantum tunneling .",
    "examples include the lipkin - meshov - glick model in nuclear physics@xcite , the rotational spectrum of polyatomic molecules  @xcite , and the hamamoto - mottleson model  @xcite for the @xmath0 staggering of the rotational spectra of certain superdeformed nuclei .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of such a problem is provided by the hamiltonian = -k_1 s_z^2 + k_2 s_x^2 , [ ham ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) are components of the spin operator @xmath7 obeying the usual commutation rules = i _ s_. [ cr ] further , the spin has a magnitude @xmath8 , i.e. , the operator @xmath9 has eigenvalue @xmath10 . as @xmath11 ,",
    "the system is more and more classical , and in the limit it has two degenerate ground states corresponding to @xmath12 . for large but finite @xmath8",
    ", the quantal analogs of these states will be admixed by a tunneling matrix element @xmath13 .",
    "the two lowest energy eigenstates will then be split by an amount @xmath14 .",
    "the goal of a tunneling calculation is to find an expression for @xmath14 that is asymptotically valid as @xmath11 . in analogy with the result for particles with a position like coordinate in a potential well , we expect this expression to take the form 0 = e^-(b_0 + b_1 + b_2 + ) , [ asy ] where b_0 b_1 b_2 [ bseq ] in the sense that @xmath15 , @xmath16 as @xmath17 . by looking at the commutation relations for the scaled operators",
    "@xmath18 , we can see that @xmath19 plays the same role as @xmath20 in conventional wkb theory , and we thus expect @xmath21 . as is often done for a particle in a well ,",

    "this one must know all @xmath28 that are of @xmath29 or greater .",
    "the first correct calculation to such accuracy that we know of was done by enz and schilling  @xcite , who mapped the spin onto a canonically conjugate variable pair via a villain transformation , and then applied an instanton method  @xcite to the resulting problem .",
    "great care must be taken in this approach with operator ordering problems , leading to a rather complex calculation .",
    "a more natural approach is one based on klauder s spin - coherent - state path integral  @xcite . a naive application of instanton methods for the tunnel splitting to this path integral @xcite , however , only gives the leading @xmath8 dependence correctly .",

    "once again , the simplicity of the instanton approach is lost .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have a means of calculating the tunnel splitting using only elementary methods of analysis .",
    "such an approach is provided by the discrete wkb method .",

    "the method is a straightforward generalization of the continuous wkb method  @xcite , and it may also be viewed as equivalent to the use of semiclassical dynamics for bloch electrons .",
    "the earliest appearance of this method in a physics context of which we are aware is by schulten and gordon @xcite , who use it to find semiclassical approximations for the @xmath32 ( wigner ) and @xmath33 ( racah ) symbols .",
    "a cogent review of the method in the context of atomic physics has been given by braun @xcite , who also cites its application in a variety of other physics settings , as well as earlier discussions in russian mathematics texts .",
    "it has also been previously applied to spin tunneling problems by van hemmen and st  @xcite .",
    "these authors have not , however , utilized the method to its full potential .",
    "specifically , they calculate @xmath14 for a class of hamiltonians including = -s_z^2 - s_x , [ ham2 ] but only the leading @xmath8 dependence is correctly found .",

    "other problems commonly solved by the continuous wkb method , such as escape from a metastable well , are also amenable to the method , but we do not discuss these here .",

    "v. we compare our answers for the splittings with numerical results , and in the case of eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) to answers given by van hemmen and and st  @xcite , and scharf , wreszinski , and van hemmen  @xcite .",
    "to introduce the discrete wkb method , let us consider the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , and focus on an energy eigenfunction @xmath37 . denoting @xmath30 eigenfunctions @xmath38 with @xmath39 as usual , and writing @xmath40",
    ", it is easy to see that schrdinger s equation takes the form of a three - term recursion relation connecting @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the step @xmath44 in the index is inconvenient , so it is preferable to change the notation somewhat , and relabel the states which are connected to each other by an index @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 equals @xmath8 or @xmath48 .",
    "the schrdinger equation then takes the form w_j",
    "c_j + t_j , j+1 c_j+1 + t_j , j-1c_j-1 = e c_j , [ ttr ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being understood as zero .",
    "we may also assume that @xmath53 for any @xmath45 , since otherwise the matrix for @xmath54 is block diagonal , and eq .",
    "( [ ttr ] ) may be regarded as applying to one block .",
    "we can also choose the phases of the basis states so that all @xmath55 are real .",
    "hermiticity then yields @xmath56 .",
    "the above problem is equivalent to a tight - binding model for an electron on a one - dimensional lattice with on - site energies @xmath57 , and hopping matrix elements @xmath55 , and indeed our notation is chosen to reflect this analogy .",
    "if @xmath57 and @xmath58 vary slowly enough with @xmath45 ( how slowly will be seen below ) we may use the approximation of semiclassical electron dynamics . to do this",
    "we first note that for the uniform case where @xmath59 and @xmath60 for all @xmath45 , the eigenstates are bloch states with wavefunction @xmath61 and energy @xmath62 . for the nonuniform case , we first extend @xmath45 to be a continuous variable , and define @xmath63 and @xmath64 to be extensions of @xmath57 and @xmath55 via the relations w(j ) & = & w_j , [ wj ] + t(j ) & = & ( t_j , j+1 + t_j , j-1)/2 , [ tj ] which are required to hold whenever @xmath45 is an integer .",
    "we further demand that @xmath63 and @xmath64 be smooth enough that if @xmath65 is regarded as a quantity of order @xmath66 , then = o ( w(j ) n , [ slow ] and likewise for @xmath64 .",
    "this equation is the formal statement of ` slowly varying ' coefficients . whether or not it can be satisfied depends , of course , on the problem under consideration , and it is this condition which determines whether or not the problem is amenable to solution by the discrete wkb method .",
    "it is easy to see that it holds for eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) whenever @xmath67 .",
    "we next define a local wavevector @xmath68 by the relation q(j ) = e - w(j ) / 2 t(j ) .",
    "[ qj ] further , since the electron velocity is given by @xmath69 in semiclassical dynamics , we define v(j ) = - 2 t(j ) q(j ) .",
    "[ vj ] then by a straightforward repeat of the arguments employed in the continuous wkb method ( see @xcite , e.g. ) , it is a simple matter to show that two linearly independent solutions to eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) are given by c_j ~1 ( i ^j q(j ) dj .",
    "[ cj ] a general solution is obtained by taking linear combinations of these two solutions .    a formal proof of eq .",
    "( [ cj ] ) is given by braun  @xcite , along with connection formulas , bohr - sommerfeld quantization rules , etc .",
    "we will therefore limit ourselves to a few key comments and comparisons with the continuous wkb method .",
    "the first point is that eq .",
    "( [ cj ] ) represents a development of @xmath70 in powers of @xmath71 , in which only the leading two terms are kept . to this accuracy ,",
    "we need only keep the first two terms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in an expansion in powers of @xmath72 .",
    "alternatively , we can use any expression for these functions which will reproduce the first two terms correctly .",
    "in particular , eqs .",
    "( [ wj ] ) and([tj ] ) need only hold to this order . in considering this point , it should be remembered that @xmath65 is regarded as being of @xmath73 .",
    "the second point is that the factor @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ cj ] ) has the effect of normalizing each of the two solutions so that the probability flux is conserved and has a value of unity .",
    "this follows from noting that @xmath75 , so that the particle spends a time inversely proportional to its velocity in any given coordinate segment @xmath76 .",
    "since this is exactly what we expect for a classical particle , the quantum mechanical wavefunction is correctly adjusted to give a conserved probability flux .",
    "the third point is that for a given energy @xmath77 , the classically accessible region of motion is defined by the inequalities & & u^-(j ) e u^+(j ) , [ class ] + & & u^ = w(j ) 2|t(j)| . [ upm ] this follows from eqs .",
    "( [ qj ] ) and ( [ vj ] ) because whenever the condition ( [ class ] ) is violated , @xmath68 and @xmath78 acquire imaginary parts .",
    "the expression ( [ cj ] ) [ with @xmath79 replaced by @xmath80 as usual ] then describes an exponentially decaying or growing wavefunction as opposed to an oscillatory one .",
    "it may also be noted that for uniform @xmath57 and @xmath55 , the quantities @xmath81 would be the limits of the allowable range of bloch state energies .",
    "more generally they may be regarded as local , @xmath45-dependent band edges .    finally , let us note the conditions for the validity of eq .",
    "( [ cj ] ) .",
    "the physical requirement is that the wavelength of the particle should not change by very much over dimensions of the wavelength itself , which is equivalent to demanding that |dq(j)/dj| ^2q(j ) .",
    "[ slowq ] in addition to failing if @xmath63 and @xmath64 do not vary slowly ( as defined above ) , it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ slowq ] ) is violated whenever @xmath82 or @xmath83 . in light of eqs .",
    "( [ class ] ) and ( [ upm ] ) , this is hardly surprising , since these are turning points of the classical motion .",
    "solutions of the form ( [ cj ] ) on opposite sides of these points must be related to each other by the above mentioned connection formulas , as in the usual wkb method .",
    "in this section we consider the problem where the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 possess reflection symmetry about some point , and the central region is classically forbidden for some energies .",
    "the band - edge functions @xmath84 then have the form shown in fig .",
    "1 . we will derive a formula [ see eq .",
    "( [ edif ] ) ] for the tunnel splitting between states formed from symmetrical states localized in the two potential wells .",
