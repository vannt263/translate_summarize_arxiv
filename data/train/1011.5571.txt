    "low energy electron transport across the interface between normal metals and superconductors ( ns ) is provided by the mechanism of andreev reflection @xcite .",
    "this mechanism involves conversion of a subgap quasiparticle entering the superconductor from the normal metal into a cooper pair together with simultaneous creation of a hole that goes back into the normal metal .",
    "each such act of electron - hole reflection corresponds to transferring twice the electron charge @xmath1 across the ns interface and results , e.g. , in non - zero conductance of the system at subgap energies @xcite .",
    "andreev reflection is also responsible for dc josephson effect in superconducting weak links without tunnel barriers .",
    "suffering andreev reflections at both @xmath2 interfaces , quasiparticles with energies below the superconducting gap are effectively `` trapped '' inside the junction forming a discrete set of levels which can be tuned by passing the supercurrent across the system @xcite . at the same time , these subgap andreev levels themselves contribute to the supercurrent @xcite thus making the behavior of superconducting point contacts and @xmath3 junctions in many respects different from that of tunnel barriers .",
    "note that the above theories remain applicable if one can neglect coulomb effects . in small - size superconducting contacts ,",
    "however , such effects can be important and should in general be taken into account .",
    "a lot is known about interplay between fluctuations and charging effects in superconducting tunnel barriers @xcite . here",
    "we examine the properties of superconducting junctions going beyond the tunneling limit . below",
    "we will demonstrate that coulomb blockade in such junctions weakens with increasing barrier transmissions and eventually disappears in the limit of fully open superconducting contacts .",
    "we will also argue that in superconducting systems  similarly to normal contacts @xcite  there also exists a direct relation between coulomb effects and current fluctuations .",
    "as it is shown in fig . 1 , we will consider big metallic reservoirs one of which is superconducting while another one could be either normal or superconducting .",
    "these two reservoirs are connected by a rather short normal bridge ( conductor ) with arbitrary transmission distribution @xmath4 of its conducting modes and normal state conductance @xmath5 .",
    "both phase and energy relaxation of electrons may occur only in the reservoirs and not inside the conductor which length is assumed to be shorter than dephasing and inelastic relaxation lengths . as usually , coulomb interaction between electrons in the conductor area is accounted for by some effective capacitance @xmath6 .        in order to analyze electron transport in the presence of interactions we will make use of an approach based on the effective action formalism combined with the scattering matrix technique @xcite",
    ". this approach can be conveniently generalized to superconducting systems .",
    "in fact , the structure of the effective action remains the same also in the supeconducting case , one should only replace normal propagators by @xmath7 matrix green functions which account for superconductivity , as it was done , e.g. , in @xcite .    following the standard procedure we express the kernel @xmath8 of the evolution operator on the keldysh contour in terms of a path integral over the fermionic fields which can be integrated out after the standard hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the interacting term .",

    "the effective action consists of two terms , @xmath14=s_c[\\varphi ] + s_t[\\varphi ] $ ] , where @xmath15= \\frac{c}{2e^2}\\int\\limits_0^t dt ' ( \\dot\\varphi_{1}^2-\\dot\\varphi_{2}^2)\\equiv \\frac{c}{e^2}\\int\\limits_0^t dt \\dot\\varphi^+\\dot\\varphi^-\\label{sc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describes charging effects and the term @xmath16 $ ] accounts for electron transfer between normal and superconducting reservoirs .",

    "( [ sc ] ) we also introduced `` classical '' and `` quantum '' parts of the phase , respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    for later purposes we also express the average current and the current - current correlator via the effective action as @xmath23 } , \\label{curr}\\\\ & & \\frac12\\langle \\hat i\\hat i\\rangle_+=-e^2\\int { \\cal d } \\varphi_{\\pm}\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta    \\varphi_-(t)\\delta\\varphi_-(t')}e^{is[\\varphi ] } , \\label{corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .",

    "now let us separately consider ns and ss interfaces .      at temperatures and voltages well below the superconducting gap andreev contribution to the action of ns system dominates .",
    "hence , it suffices to consider the limit of low energies @xmath31 . in this limit",
    "we can define the andreev transmissions @xcite @xmath32 and andreev conductance @xmath33 .",
    "let us assume that either dimensionless andreev conductance @xmath34 is large , @xmath35 , or temperature is sufficiently high ( though still smaller than @xmath36 ) . in either case one can describe quantum dynamics of the phase variable @xmath37 within the quasiclassical approximation @xcite which amounts to expanding @xmath26 in powers of ( small ) `` quantum '' part of the phase @xmath38 . employing the above equations and expanding @xmath26 up to terms @xmath39 we arrive at the andreev effective action @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 } \\varphi^-(t')\\varphi^-(t '' ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times [ \\beta_a \\cos(2\\varphi^+(t')-2\\varphi^+(t '' ) ) + 1-\\beta_a ] \\label{sins}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath42 is the andreev fano factor defined in a complete analogy with the normal fano factor @xmath43 .",
    "we observe that the action @xmath26 is expressed in exactly the same form as that for normal conductors @xcite derived within the the same quasiclassical approximation for the phase variable @xmath44 . in order to observe the correspondence between the action @xcite and that defined in eqs .",
    "( [ finals])-([sins ] ) one only needs to interchange normal and andreev conductances as well as the corresponding fano factors @xmath45 and to account for an extra factor 2 in front of the phase @xmath46 under @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ sins ] ) .",
    "this extra factor implies doubling of the charge during andreev reflection .      turning to superconducting contacts",
    "we assume that fluctuating phases @xmath48 are sufficiently small and perform regular expansion of the exact effective action in powers of these phases .",
    "then we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the time - independent phase difference , @xmath51 defines the supercurrent across the system @xcite and @xmath52 with both kernels @xmath53 and @xmath54 being real functions .",
    "the complete expressions for these functions turn out to be somewhat lengthy and for this reason are not presented here .",
    "below we only emphasize some of the properties of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    to begin with , it is straightforward to verify that in the lowest order in barrier transmissions @xmath4 the result ( [ finalss])-([siii ] ) reduces to the standard aes action @xcite for tunnel barriers in the limit of small phase fluctuations .",
    "qualitatively new features emerge in higher orders in @xmath4 being directly related to the presence of subgap andreev levels @xmath55 inside the contact .",
    "consider , for instance , the kernel @xmath54 .",
    "it can be split into three contributions of different physical origin @xmath56 the first of these terms , @xmath57 , represents the subgap contribution due to discrete andreev states .",
    "the fourier transform of this term has the form @xmath58 [ \\delta\\left(\\omega-2\\epsilon_n(\\chi)\\right)+ \\delta\\left(\\omega+2\\epsilon_n(\\chi)\\right ) ] \\bigg\\}. \\label{i1 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obvious that this contribution is not contained in the aes action at all .",
    "the second term @xmath59 can be interpreted as the  interference term  between subgap andreev levels and quasiparticle states above the gap . in the low temperature limit",
    "@xmath60 the fourier transform of this term @xmath61 differs from zero only at sufficiently high frequencies @xmath62 . at higher temperatures",
    "@xmath63 , however , @xmath61 vanishes only for @xmath64 and remains non - zero otherwise . in the limit of small barrier transmissions",
    "this term scales as @xmath65 and , hence , is not contained in the aes action either .",
    "finally , the third term @xmath66 accounts for the contribution of quasiparticles with energies above the gap . in the high frequency limit @xmath67 or for @xmath68 this term reduces to the standard result for a normal conductor @xmath69 .",
    "turning now to the function @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ srrr ] ) we note that its fourier transform can be represented as @xmath70 , where both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are real functions .",
    "the function @xmath71 is even in @xmath73 while @xmath72 is an odd function of @xmath73 , thus implying that the function @xmath53 is real .    the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not independent .",
    "for instance , the fourier transform @xmath72 is related to @xmath74 by means of the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath75 .",
    "the two functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 are in turn linked to each other by the causality principle : the function @xmath53 should vanish for @xmath76 .",
    "finally we would like to point out that with the aid of the above gaussian effective action one can easily evaluate the phase - phase correlation functions for our problem . combining eqs .",
    "( [ finalss])-([siii ] ) with ( [ sc ] ) one finds ( cf .",
    ", e.g. @xcite ) @xmath77    now we will employ the above results in order to describe the effect of electron - electron interactions on transport properties of superconducting contacts .",

( [ sn1 ] ) reduces to the result @xcite while in the diffusive regime the correlator ( [ sn1 ] ) matches with the semiclassical result @xcite .",
    "let us now turn on interactions . in this case",
    "one should add the charging term ( [ sc ] ) to the action and account for phase fluctuations .",
    "proceeding along the same lines as in @xcite , for @xmath35 or max@xmath83 we get @xmath84 .",
    "\\label{iv}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the digamma function , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ iv ] ) is the interaction correction to the i - v curve which scales with andreev fano factor @xmath88 in exactly the same way as the shot noise .",
    "thus , we arrive at an important conclusion : _ interaction correction to andreev conductance of ns structures is proportional to the shot noise power in such structures_. this fundamental relation between interaction effects and shot noise goes along with that established earlier for normal conductors @xcite extending it to superconducting systems . in both cases",
    "this relation is due to discrete nature of the charge carriers passing through the conductor .",
    "another important observation is that the interaction correction to andreev conductance defined in eq .",
    "( [ iv ] ) has exactly the same functional form as that for normal conductors , cf .",
    "( 25 ) in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a special case of diffusive systems we have @xmath89 , @xmath90 and the only difference between the interaction corrections to the i - v curve in normal and ns systems is the charge doubling in the latter case . as a result ,",
    "the coulomb dip on the i - v curve of a diffusive ns system at any given @xmath91 is exactly _ 2 times narrower _ than that in the normal case .",
    "we believe that this narrowing effect was detected in normal wires attached to superconducting electrodes @xcite , cf .",
    "3c in that paper .",
    "let us now turn to the electron - electron interaction correction to the equilibrium josephson current ( [ ichi ] ) .",
    "previously such correction was analyzed in the case of josephson tunnel barriers in the presence of linear ohmic dissipation @xcite .",
    "the task at hand is to investigate the interaction correction to the supercurrent in contacts with arbitrary transmission distribution .    in order to evaluate the interaction correction",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the gaussian effective action ( [ finalss])-([siii ] ) and to evaluate the higher order contribution @xmath92 .",
    "it is easy to observe that the interaction correction to the supercurrent is provided by the following non - gaussian terms in the effective action : @xmath93 the function @xmath94 can be written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "the function @xmath97 can be expressed in a similar way .    adding the non - gaussian terms ( [ 3rd ] ) to the action and employing eq .",
    "( [ curr ] ) we arrive at the following expression for the interaction correction @xmath98 where the phase - phase correlators are defined in eq .",
    "( [ phiphi ] ) .",
    "let us consider the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ zs ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that in the limit of low temperatures only frequencies @xmath99 contribute to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ phiphi ] ) for @xmath100 while the contribution from the frequency interval @xmath101 vanishes .",
    "furthermore , the leading contribution from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ zs ] ) is picked up logarithmically from the interval @xmath102 where @xmath103 and the function @xmath104 tends to a frequency independent value .    after a straightforward but tedious calculation in the interesting frequency range @xmath105 from eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) one finds @xmath106 this high - frequency term involves the factor @xmath107 , i.e. it vanishes for fully open conducting channels .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ as ] ) , ( [ yw ] ) with ( [ zs ] ) , we arrive at the expression for the supercurrent @xmath108 in the limit of low temperatures the interaction correction reads @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the dimensionless normal state conductance of the contact .",
    "this result is justified as long as the coulomb correction @xmath111 remains much smaller than the non - interacting term @xmath112 ( [ ichi ] ) .",
    "typically this condition requires the dimensionless conductance to be large @xmath113 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ intcor ] ) was derived only from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ zs ] ) .",
    "the second term in this equation involving the function @xmath114 and the correlator @xmath115 can be treated analogously .",
    "it turns out to be smaller than that of the first term by the logarithmic factor @xmath116 .",
    "let us emphasize again an important property of the result ( [ intcor ] ) : the interaction correction contains the factor @xmath107 and , hence , vanishes for fully open barriers . in other words ,",
    "_ no coulomb blockade of the josephson current is expected in fully transparent superconducting contacts_.    the expression for the interaction correction ( [ intcor ] ) can further be specified in the case of diffusive contacts . in the absence of interactions",
    "the josephson current in such contacts follows from ( [ ichi ] ) and takes the form corresponding to the zero - temperature limit of a well known kulik - omelyanchuk formula for a short diffusive wire @xmath117 including interactions and averaging ( [ intcor ] ) with the bimodal transmission distribution @xmath118 one finds @xmath119 .",
    "\\label{intdif}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the result ( [ intcor ] ) can formally be reproduced if one substitutes @xmath120 into eq .",
    "( [ ichi ] ) , where @xmath121 and then expands the result to the first order in @xmath122 .",
    "interestingly , the same transmission renormalization ( [ tcor ] ) follows from the renormalization group ( rg ) equations @xcite @xmath123 derived for _ normal _ conductors . in order to arrive at eq .",
    "( [ tcor ] ) one should just start the rg flow at @xmath124 and stop it at @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the result ( [ intcor ] ) can be interpreted in a very simple manner : coulomb interaction provides high frequency renormalization @xmath126 ( [ tcor ] ) of the barrier transmissions which should be substituted into the classical expression for the supercurrent ( [ ichi ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the last step would by no means appear obvious without our rigorous derivation since the coulomb correction to the josephson current originates from the term @xmath127 in the effective action which is , of course , totally absent in the normal case .",
    "in this paper we derived a general expression for the effective action of superconducting contacts with arbitrary transmissions of conducting channels . in the case of ns systems we described the interplay between coulomb blockade and andreev reflection and demonstrated a direct relation between shot noise and interaction effects in these structures .",
    "the fundamental physical reason behind this relation lies in discrete nature of the charge carriers  electrons and cooper pairs  passing through ns interfaces .",
    "our results allow to explain recent experimental findings @xcite .",
    "superconducting contacts with arbitrary channel transmissions show qualitatively new features as compared to the case of josephson tunnel barriers @xcite .",
    "the main physical reason for such differences is the presence of subgap andreev bound states inside the system .",
    "our results for the interaction correction might explain a rapid change between superconducting and insulating behavior recently observed @xcite in comparatively short metallic wires with resistances close to the quantum resistance unit @xmath128 k@xmath129 in - between two bulk superconductors . previously it was already argued @xcite that such a superconductor - to - insulator crossover can be due to coulomb effects .",
    "our present results provide further quantitative arguments in favor of this conclusion .",
