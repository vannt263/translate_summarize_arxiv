    "the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) has been proposed as an extension to the standard model ( sm ) , in part because it provides an additional mechanism for cp violation @xcite .",
    "various experimental observations impose non - trivial constraints on it .",
    "for example , the @xmath5 oscillations @xcite and @xmath6 decay width @xcite exclude low values of @xmath0 , whereas the @xmath7 rate @xcite excludes values of the charged - higgs mass , @xmath8 , below approximately 300  gev @xcite . also , the precise measurements at lep of the so - called @xmath9 parameter constrain the mass splitting in the higgs sector , and force the masses to be not too far from the @xmath10 mass scale @xcite . while these individual constraints are all well - known , we are not aware of any dedicated attempt to combine them , other than those of @xcite .",
    "there are also theoretical consistency conditions .",
    "in particular , for vacuum stability , the potential has to be positive for large values of the fields @xcite",
    ". we shall furthermore require the higgs ",
    "higgs scattering amplitudes to satisfy perturbative unitarity @xcite . taken together",
    ", these constraints dramatically reduce the allowed parameter space of the model .",
    "the unitarity conditions are traditionally phrased in terms of upper bounds on the higgs masses @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a study of the vacuum stability ( or positivity ) and unitarity conditions .",
    "these limits will here be seen in conjunction with the cp - violating yukawa couplings .",
    "we will study how the cp - violating couplings are constrained by the stability and unitarity constraints , for various higgs mass scenarios .",
    "the combination with experimental constraints will be considered elsewhere .    in our parameterization of the model",
    ", we emphasize the masses and mixing angles .",
    "the latter are closely related to the yukawa couplings , and thus somewhat more `` physical '' than the parameters of the potential , to which they are clearly related .",
    "[ sect : model ] the present study is limited to the 2hdm  ( ii ) , which is defined by having one higgs doublet ( @xmath11 ) couple to the up - type quarks , and the other ( @xmath12 ) to the down - type quarks @xcite .",
    "we take the 2hdm potential to be parametrized as : @xmath13 \\\\ & -\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{m_{11}^2(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1 ) \\!+\\!\\left[m_{12}^2 ( \\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)\\!+\\!{\\rm h.c.}\\right ] \\!+\\!m_{22}^2(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the @xmath14 symmetry will be respected by the quartic terms , and flavour - changing neutral currents are constrained @xcite",
    ". we shall refer to this model ( without the @xmath15 and @xmath16 terms ) as the @xmath17 .",
    "the more general model , with also @xmath15 and @xmath16 couplings , will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we allow for cp violation , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 may be complex .",
    "all three neutral states will then mix , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is determined from second derivatives of the above potential .",
    "the @xmath22 mixing matrix @xmath23 governing the neutral sector will be parametrized in terms of the angles @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 as in @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , etc . , and @xmath30 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , the angles are denoted as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 . ) for these angular ranges , we have @xmath34 , @xmath35 , whereas @xmath36 and @xmath37 may be either positive or negative .",
    "we will use the terminology `` general 2hdm '' as a reminder that cp violation is allowed .    with all three masses",
    "different , there are three limits of _ no _ cp violation , i.e. , with two higgs bosons that are cp even and one that is odd .",
    "the three limits are @xcite : @xmath38 these limits of no cp - violation are indicated in fig .  [",
