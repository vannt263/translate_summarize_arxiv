    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin systems have attracted considerable attention because of their intriguing ground states where quantum fluctuations play a crucial role .",
    "much excitement in their magnetism has been caused by the theoretical prediction that the integer - spin chains have an energy gap in the excitation spectrum,@xcite while the half - integer spin chains have a gapless excitation spectrum.@xcite in particular , 1d @xmath4 heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( haf ) systems are interesting since enhanced quantum fluctuations due to reduced dimensionality and low spin value impede long range magnetic order ( lro ) . in the last decade ,",
    "theoretical studies on these systems have achieved a remarkable progress but real material realizations for such compounds are limited to date .",
    "the @xmath4 chains formed via direct linkage of cuo@xmath13 units can be grouped into two categories : in one group , the chains are formed by edge - sharing cuo@xmath13 units while in the other compound family they are built from corner - sharing cuo@xmath13 units .",
    "cugeo@xmath14 and li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 belong to the former category@xcite , where the nearest neighbor ( nn ) interaction @xmath5 and the next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath15 have comparable strength ( @xmath16 1 ) thereby leading to a strong frustration within the chain .",
    "in such a scenario , various ground states are possible . on the contrary , in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath14 which has corner shared cuo@xmath13 units @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 , which greatly reduces the in - chain frustration@xcite . with @xmath5 @xmath20 t@xmath21",
    ", sr@xmath0cuo@xmath14 is a better quasi-1d @xmath4 chain system than cugeo@xmath14 and li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 .",
    "recently another system , sr@xmath0cu(po@xmath13)@xmath0 containing isolated cuo@xmath13 units ( neither edge- nor corner - shared ) was reported to have @xmath22 @xmath18 @xmath23 and a much reduced @xmath24 of 85 mk@xcite .",
    "the presence of inter - chain coupling ( ic ) normally provides lro , while frustrating ic reduces the tendency to lro .",
    "along with @xmath5 @xmath20 @xmath24 , the presence of frustration between the chains strongly influences the 1d nature of this system , making it a nearly perfect realization for the 1d nn only haf chain model .",
    "unfortunately the sample quality was not very good , thereby reducing the chains to a finite length .",
    "the analytical solution by bethe ansatz@xcite provides a clear picture of the magnetic ( thermodynamic ) properties of a very good 1d material .",
    "thus , deviations from these predictions can be assigned to other degrees of freedom ( anisotropy , dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) and other spin - spin interactions ) allowing to analyse their influence on the ground state behaviour .",
    "therefore , strong interest still prevails in the experimental community to find possible ways to synthesize a system which keeps the in - chain geometry of sr@xmath0cu(po@xmath13)@xmath0 , but with a smaller inter - chain coupling which is still frustrating , along with an improved sample quality .",
    "formaly , k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 belongs to the family of m@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 ( m = li , na , k ) compounds , though the arrangement of the magnetic cuo@xmath25 building blocks is modified within the family .",
    "the magnetic properties of na@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 and li@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1  were reported earlier.@xcite na@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 and li@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 both have an in - chain exchange coupling @xmath5 of about 28 k and they undergo magnetic ordering at around 5 k. unlike the other members of this family , our experiments reveal that k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 shows a much stronger in - chain exchange interaction ( @xmath26 k ) but no ordering down to 2 k. due to such a wide @xmath24@xmath5 temperature range it can be considered as a very good candidate on which to test the theoretical predictions of both static and dynamic properties of an 1d haf model .    in this paper , we present susceptibility , specific heat , @xmath2p nmr results and first principles band structure calculations on k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 in order to shed light on the 1d character of the system .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in the next two sections , we describe the structural aspects , measurement procedures and the theoretical methodology . in section iv we present the experimental results followed by the electronic structure analysis . in the discussion section ,",
    "we address the issues concerning the almost ideal 1d nature of this compound inferred from the @xmath2p nmr and band structure calculations . at the end",

    "the super - exchange between cu@xmath34 ions in k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 will be similar to that of edge sharing cuo@xmath13 chains with every second cuo@xmath13 unit cut - off .",

    "bulk magnetic susceptibility @xmath67 (= @xmath68 ) was measured as a function of temperature in an applied field of 5 koe ( fig .",
    "[ susceptibility ] ) .",
    "as shown in the figure , the sample exhibits a shoulder at about 100 k , suggesting a maximum in this temperature range , which is a hallmark of low - dimensional magnetic interactions . with further decreasing temperature , @xmath67 increases again in a curie - weiss manner .",
    "common sources for such an increase are the presence of paramagnetic impurities or finite length chains due to disorder .",
    "however , an intrinsic curie like tail is expected in a quasi 1d @xmath4 chain , if dm interaction and/or a staggered @xmath69-factor anisotropy are present.@xcite among the 3d systems , cu benzoate @xcite and pyrimidine cu dinitrate@xcite are well known examples .",
    "no obvious features associated with lro were observed for @xmath70 k @xmath71 @xmath47 @xmath71 @xmath72 k.    in order to fit the bulk susceptibility data , we decomposed @xmath73 into    _ _",

    "@xmath77 is the spin susceptibility for a uniform @xmath4 1d haf system , which is known quite precisely over the whole measured temperature range .",
    "we took the johnston s expression@xcite valid for @xmath78 .",

    "therefore we reduced the number of fitting parameters by fixing @xmath69 = 2.2 ( obtained from nmr shift analysis)@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath84 is comparable to that found in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath14@xcite .",
    "the curie contribution present in the sample would correspond to a defect spin concentration of @xmath85 % assuming defect spin @xmath4 .",
    "alternatively , it would correspond to the contribution expected for finite chains with a length of @xmath18 15 spins according to the calculation of schmidt _ et al.,_@xcite . we add in fig .",
    "2 a plot of @xmath86 as a function of temperature , after subtracting the curie contribution . now a pronounced broad maximum around 100 k is well resolved .",
    "the small peak at 50 k corresponds to a parasitic contribution of adsorbed oxygen .",
    "unfortunately , we failed to improve the quality of the sample , since further annealing ( in flowing ar or vacuum ) did not lead to any noticeable change in the xrd pattern .    the information about the lattice dimensionality can be obtained from the low temperature specific heat @xmath48 . for a @xmath4 chain ,",
    "one expects a linear term , whereas for a square lattice , one expects a leading quadratic term in the absence of excitation gap . in the @xmath87 vs. @xmath88 plot ( shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ susceptibility ] ) in the temperature range 5 k @xmath89 12 k , one can see clearly that the plot follows a straight line over a considerable temperature range .",
    "this indicates that @xmath48 is a sum of a linear and a cubic contribution .",
    "since the cubic term corresponds to the expected contribution of the phonons , this demonstrate that the leading term of the magnetic contribution is linear in @xmath47 . for an @xmath4 haf chain ,",
    "theoretical calculations@xcite predict for low temperatures ( @xmath90 ) ; @xmath91 . with @xmath92 k obtained from the nmr shift @xmath3 analysis ( presented later ) , this corresponds to a value @xmath93 j / k@xmath94 mole .",

    "this strongly supports the quasi 1d nature of the spin system in k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "no other anomaly was observed down to @xmath53 k in @xmath48 , suggesting the absence of magnetic order . below @xmath98 k , our experimental data deviates upward from the straight line fit ( inset fig .",
    "[ susceptibility ] ) .",
    "this is likely related to the contributions of paramagnetic impurities and of chain ends , which should follow a @xmath99 @xmath18 @xmath100 behavior .",
    "although our analysis of the susceptibility and specific heat suggests the presence of a @xmath12 1d haf system , the evidence is only of preliminary nature because of the large curie tail in @xmath101 at low @xmath47 . in order to gain a more reliable insight into this system , we turned our attention towards nmr results .",
    "nmr has the advantage to be much less sensitive to contribution of defects or impurities , because usually only the nucleus on an undistorted site contributes to the narrow nmr line . as shown in the crystal structures ( fig .",
    "[ str ] ) , k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 has two inequivalent @xmath2p sites which are coupled inductively to cu@xmath34 ions in the chain .",

    "[ nmr ] ) .",
    "although there are two inequivalent @xmath2p sites present the crystal structure , a single resonance line implies that both the @xmath2p sites in this compound are nearly identical .",
    "with decreasing temperature , the nmr line shifts away from the larmor frequency , broadens paramagnetically but the overall line shape remain same down to @xmath53 k. the asymmetric shape of the spectra corresponds to a powder pattern due to an asymmetric hyperfine coupling .    the temperature dependence of the nmr shift @xmath102 is shown in fig .",
    "[ nmrshift ] . with decreasing temperature",

    "one measures accurately the @xmath86 by nmr shift without suffering from the contribution from the free spins and extrinsic foreign phases , which limits the accuracy of the bulk susceptibility measurements .",
    "therefore , it is more reliable to extract the magnetic parameters from the temperature dependence of the nmr shift rather than from the bulk susceptibility .",
    "the conventional scheme of correlating @xmath3 and @xmath67 is to plot , @xmath102 vs. @xmath105 with @xmath47 as an implicit parameter",

    ". thus @xmath11 should include contributions from both the uniform @xmath191 and staggered @xmath192 spin fluctuations .",
    "a theoretical analysis by sachdev@xcite shows that the staggered component is dominant at low temperatures ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "indeed , the uniform component leads to @xmath194 , while the staggered component gives @xmath11 = constant .",
    "monte carlo calculations by sandvik supported the validity of these results over an appropriate temperature range.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ relax ] , our experimentally observed constant @xmath11 at low temperatures ( @xmath195 ) suggests the dominance of staggered fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "the @xmath2p form factor for such systems is defined in ref .  .",
    "since @xmath2p is located symmetrically between the cu ions , the fluctuations are expected to be filtered out provided the hyperfine couplings are equal .",
    "moreover in this case we still have a significant remnant contribution from @xmath196 which plays a dominant role at low temperatures .",
    "the possible origin of the remnant staggered fluctuations could be the unequal hyperfine couplings .",
    "in fact , such features have been previously observed in a few other 1d @xmath4 haf systems where @xmath197.@xcite the strong increase of @xmath11 with t above 30 k could be attributed to the uniform fluctuations .",
    "when the dominant contribution is from @xmath198 , then one expects a constant @xmath199 .",
    "in k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 , for @xmath200 k , we rather observe a weak temperature dependency ( inset of fig .  [ relax ] ) which might be due to some remanent contributions from the staggered fluctuations and/or some additional relaxation mechanisms .",
    "this weak temperature dependence as well as the reduction of the slope in the plot @xmath11 versus @xmath47 above 180 k might be related to spin diffusion as observed in @xmath201-vo(po@xmath14)@xmath0 above @xmath5@xcite .",
    "the relaxation rate due to staggered fluctuations can be calculated following the prescription of barzykin@xcite . for the purpose of comparison of theory with experiment",
    "he defined the normalized dimensionless nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate at low - temperature @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is @xmath204 . assuming the fluctuations to be correlated because of the exchange @xmath5 along the chains , @xmath11 can be written as @xmath205 . using this expression , @xmath59 at the @xmath2p site wascalculated to be about @xmath206 sec,@xmath207 whereas our experimental value is 50 sec,@xmath207 in the @xmath53 k @xmath208 @xmath71 @xmath122 k range .",
    "the experimental value is about two times smaller than the theoretical value , likely due to the effect of the geometrical form factor .",
    "further on a weak logarithmic increase in @xmath11 is theoretically expected at low temperatures.@xcite in the present case , our measurements were not done down to low enough temperatures to rise this contribution above our experimental error .",
    "in conclusion , our experimental and theoretical studies of k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 demonstrate that this compound presents a very uniform and strongly 1d @xmath4 haf chain system .",
    "our nmr , specific heat and susceptibility measurements show good agreement with theoretical predictions for a 1d @xmath12 haf chain .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the nmr shift @xmath102 can be fitted in good agreement with model calculations giving @xmath209 ( 141@xmath1095 ) k. a calculation of the exchange interactions using a tbm fitted to the results of _ ab initio _ lda band structure calculations , subsequently mapped onto a heisenberg model , leads to a quite similar value of @xmath209 190 k and evidences extremely weak nnn interactions as well as extremely weak and `` frustrated '' inter - chain exchange of the order of @xmath210 0.1 k , in contrast to sr@xmath0cu(po@xmath13)@xmath0 with @xmath210 9 k@xcite and to sr@xmath0cuo@xmath14 `` non - frustrated '' @xmath210 10 k@xcite .",
    "the absence of any evidence for magnetic order above 2 k in the experimental data confirms the weakness of the inter - chain exchanges . using the tbm results , a rough estimate of the nel temperature results in a value of @xmath211 37 mk , only .",
    "k@xmath0cup@xmath0o@xmath1 has the smallest in - chain as well as frustrating smallest inter - chain exchanges which do not suppress quantum fluctuations , thereby making this system an even better example of a 1d @xmath12 haf system than the compounds reported so far .",
    "we further studied the magnetic fluctuations by analysing the temperature dependence of @xmath11 . at low temperatures",
    "@xmath11 remains constant , in reasonable agreement with sachdev s predictions for 1d @xmath4 haf system where relaxation is dominated by @xmath196 at low @xmath47 .",
    "below 5 k , we obtained a decrease of the nmr shift @xmath102 which is more pronounced than that expected for a 1d @xmath12 haf .",
    "it s origin is not yet clear , but might be due to dm interactions .",
