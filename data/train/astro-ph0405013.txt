    "although the ly@xmath1 forest  was discovered many decades ago @xcite , it has only recently emerged as one of the prime tracers of the large scale structure in the universe .",
    "the high resolution measurements using the keck hires spectrograph @xcite have been largely reproduced using hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and semi - analytical models @xcite .",
    "the picture that has emerged from these studies is one in which the neutral gas responsible for the absorption is in a relatively low density , smooth environment , which implies a simple connection between the gas and the underlying dark matter .",
    "the neutral fraction of the gas is determined by the interplay between the recombination rate ( which depends on the temperature of the gas ) and ionization caused by ultraviolet photons .",
    "photoionization heating and expansion cooling cause the gas density and temperature to be tightly related , except where mild shocks heat up the gas .",
    "this leads to a tight relation between the absorption and the gas density .",
    "finally , the gas density is closely related to the dark matter density on large scales , while on small scales the effects of thermal broadening and jeans smoothing must be included . in the simplest picture described here ,",
    "all of the physics ingredients are known and can be modeled .",
    "the fact that one can trace the fluctuations over a range of redshifts ( @xmath4 using ground based spectrographs ) and over a range of scales , which are typically smaller than the scales of other tracers , is the main strength of this method .",
    "it becomes particularly powerful when combined with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies or other tracers that are sensitive to larger scales .",
    "such a combination is sensitive to the shape of the primordial spectrum of fluctuations , which is one of the few observationally accessible probes of the early universe .",
    "these observations are therefore directly testing the models of the early universe such as inflation .",
    "ly@xmath1 forest  observations and constraints on cosmology have been explored by several groups in the past .",
    "most of the analyses focused on the power spectrum , @xmath5 , of the fluctuations in the ly@xmath1 forest  flux , @xmath6/\\left<\\exp(-\\tau)\\right>-1~,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the optical depth to ly@xmath1  absorption .",
    "the first such work was by @xcite , followed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these groups were limited to a few dozen spectra at most .",
    "recent theoretical analyses , in addition to above , have been performed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the latter two of these papers",
    "the degeneracy between the amplitude and slope of the primordial power spectrum and the normalization of the optical depth - density relation [ most sensitive to the intensity of uv background , and typically parametrized in terms of the mean transmitted flux fraction , @xmath8 was emphasized , which leads to a significant expansion of the allowed range of cosmological parameters relative to what one would have inferred from the errors on the flux power spectrum alone .",
    "@xcite have shown that the current ly@xmath1 forestconstraints are consistent with the @xmath9cdm  model favored by recent cmb data , testing it in a regime of redshift and length scale not probed by other measurements , but that within the @xmath9cdm  framework they do not add much leverage on parameter values beyond that afforded by the cmb data alone .",
    "an important practical implication of the theoretical breakthroughs of the 1990s is that large scale structure in the ly@xmath1 forest  can be effectively studied with moderate resolution spectra .",
    "once the spectrum is modeled as a continuous phenomenon rather than a collection of discrete lines , there is no need to resolve every feature .",
    "some of the studies cited above use high resolution ( @xmath10 ) spectra , some use moderate resolution ( @xmath11 ) spectra , and some use a mix of the two .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a new measurement of the ly@xmath1 forest   power spectrum , based on @xmath12 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) spectra that probe the ly@xmath1 forest  at a resolution @xmath13 ( @xmath14  fwhm ) .",
    "this sample is almost two orders of magnitude larger than anything that was available before .",
    "as such it greatly increases the statistical power of the ly@xmath1 forest , making it comparable to the cmb from wmap . at the same time , the required tolerance of systematic errors also increases by the same amount .",
    "this requires a careful investigation of all of the sources of systematic errors , and a large portion of this paper is devoted to the issue of possible systematics in the data and their influence on the parameters of interest .",
    "we also discuss how the analysis we perform and results we obtain differ from what can be done using the standard spectral pipeline outputs in the public sdss data . in part because of the practicalities of work in a large , multi - institutional collaboration , and in part because of the importance of obtaining an accurate measurement with well understood statistical and systematic errors , the ly@xmath1  forest power spectrum has been pursued by two independent groups within the sdss , one led by p. mcdonald and u. seljak , and the other by l. hui and a. lidz .",
    "the methods employed are different and have been developed independently .",
    "results of the alternative analysis will be presented elsewhere ( hui et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we only present the observational measurement of the sdss ly@xmath1 forest  power spectrum in the current paper .",
    "independent of any theoretical interpretation , this basic result should be robust on the scales for which we give results , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 if @xmath17 is the wavelength of a fourier mode ( not to be confused with spectral wavelength ) , here measured in @xmath18 ( note that throughout the paper we frequently use velocity in place of observed wavelength , with the understanding that all that enters into our calculations are velocity differences between pixels of measured spectra , defined by @xmath19  we do not measure power on scales large enough for the imperfections in this expression to become relevant ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath20-range is determined by the continuum fluctuations on the low end and spectral resolution at the high end .",
    "we note also that the useful range is limited not only by these uncertainties , which are related to the data analysis , but also by the uncertainties in the theoretical modeling and/or additional astrophysical effects .",
    "we will address these latter issues in more detail in a separate publication .",
    "however , we do not completely decouple the theory from the data analysis .",
    "for example , when discussing the importance of systematic errors it is useful to understand how they would affect cosmological results like the slope and amplitude of the matter power spectrum , so much of our discussion of systematics is devoted to this issue .",
    "the common usage of the term ly@xmath1 forest  is to describe the ly@xmath1  absorption by neutral hydrogen in the relatively low density bulk of the igm . in this paper",
    "we include damped - ly@xmath1  systems ( dlas ) in the definition of the `` forest '' , so it includes all hi - ly@xmath1  absorption .",
    "we could try to remove dlas before measuring @xmath0 , because they are more difficult to simulate than the lower optical depth absorption ; however ,",
    "we believe the advantage of removal is illusory . if the dlas were located randomly within the igm ( which they certainly are not completely ) , it would be simple to include them in the theory using their known column density distribution . if they are not located randomly ,",
    "the regions obscured by dlas in the spectra are special , so the effect of removing the dlas still must be understood using simulations .",
    "we leave the handling of the effects of dlas as a problem for the theory , which we will address elsewhere .",
    "absorption by metals is also difficult to simulate accurately , so we would like to remove this contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "this is relatively easy to do for transitions with wavelength @xmath21  , but it is basically impossible for transitions with @xmath22 , because the metal features always appear mixed with hi - ly@xmath1 . we will subtract the power measured in the rest wavelength range @xmath23    from our measurement of the power in the forest , which removes the effect of transitions with longer wavelength , but we leave shorter wavelength transitions as part of the forest . the only significant contaminant of this kind that we can identify is siiii absorption at @xmath24 , and we develop a simple and effective way to account for this in the theory . we refer to our final background - subtracted power spectrum as @xmath0 , and use @xmath25 for the raw power measured in the interval @xmath26 .",
    "we are using the range @xmath27   for the ly@xmath1 forest",
    ".    the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ secdataprep ] , we describe the selection of our data set and the preparation of spectra for the measurement of @xmath0 . in  [ secpowerextract ] we describe the method used to measure the power spectrum and estimate the error bars , test the procedure , and give the basic results .",
    "we perform consistency checks on the results and discuss systematic errors in  [ secconchecks ] , which is followed by a brief recipe for using our results in  [ directionsforuse ] , and conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we describe the sample of quasar spectra that we use in  [ secsampselect ] . in  [ secbal ]",
    "we explain how we remove broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars from the sample . in  [ secexpcomb ]",
    "we explain how we combine spectra from different exposures for the same quasar and use the differences between exposures to understand the noise in the data .",
    "we discuss the resolution of the spectra in  [ secrescal ] .",
    "finally , in  [ secmeandiv ] we describe how we divide each spectrum by an estimate of the quasar continuum , the expected mean absorption level in the spectrum , and a spectral calibration vector ( see below ) , to produce the vectors of transmission - fluctuation estimates , @xmath28 , for each quasar , from which we will measure @xmath0 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite uses a drift - scanning imaging camera @xcite and a 640 fiber double spectrograph on a dedicated 2.5 m telescope .",
    "it is an ongoing survey to image 10,000 sq .",
    "deg . of the sky in the sdss @xmath29",
    "ab magnitude system @xcite and to obtain spectra for @xmath30 galaxies and @xmath31 quasars .",
    "the astrometric calibration is good to better than @xmath32 rms per coordinate @xcite , and the photometric calibration is accurate to 3% or better @xcite . the data sample used in this paper was compiled in summer 2002 and is a combination of data releases one @xcite and two @xcite .",
    "about 13% of the spectroscopic survey targets are quasar candidates selected based on their colors @xcite .",
    "the magnitude limit for uv - excess objects is @xmath33 , while additional high - redshift candidates ( @xmath34 ) are targeted to @xmath35 .",
    "fibers are allocated according to a tiling algorithm @xcite , with the galaxy sample and the quasar sample being the top priorities .",
    "the remaining 8% of fibers serve for calibration purposes .",
    "sdss spectra are obtained using plates holding 640 fibers , each of which subtends 3@xmath36 on the sky ; the spectra cover @xmath37 .",
    "the pixel width is a slowly varying function of wavelength , but is typically @xmath38 .",
    "the resolution also varies , but is typically also @xmath38 rms ( i.e. , the resolution is @xmath39 and there are @xmath40 pixels per fwhm resolution element ) .",
    "all quasars have multiple spectra , usually taken one after the other ( timescales of a fraction of an hour ) , so the quasar variability can be ignored ( in the opposite case it would act as an additional source of noise ) .",
    "the co - added spectra in the official sdss release use local spline interpolation onto a uniform grid of pixels of width @xmath41 , and do not guarantee the noise to be uncorrelated .",
    "we therefore redo this step starting from the individual exposures .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below .",
    "spectral flux errors per pixel in most cases are about @xmath42 erg s@xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath43 .",
    "redshifts are automatically assigned by the sdss spectral classification algorithm , which is based on @xmath45 fitting of templates to each spectrum ( schlegel et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we limit ourselves to quasars with redshift @xmath46 when measuring the power in the ly@xmath1 forest  region of spectra , so that each spectrum contains a significant stretch of the ly@xmath1 forest  above the detector cutoff at 3800   ( which corresponds to ly@xmath1  absorption at @xmath47 ) .",
    "we use the sample compiled in summer 2002 , cut down to 3035 spectra by eliminating some plates of questionable quality , some spectra where two different redshift estimation codes disagree , and some bal quasars ( see below ) .",
    "figure [ zhist ] shows the redshift distribution of the data .",
    "the dashed , red histogram shows the distribution of quasar redshifts .",
    "the solid , black histogram shows the distribution of pixels in the range @xmath48 .",
    "note that there is a gap in the quasar redshifts around @xmath49 , which is due to the stellar locus crossing the quasar locus in the 5-color sdss photometry @xcite .",
    "figure [ fullspecexamp ] shows an example sdss spectrum of a @xmath50 quasar .",
    "this spectrum is unusual in that most have lower s / n , and most quasars are at lower redshift .",
    "we employ an additional sample of @xmath51 spectra with @xmath52 , so that we can study the full observed wavelength range , @xmath53 , outside the confusion of the ly@xmath1 forest . as we discuss in  [ secbacksubtract ] , we compute a non - negligible background power term ( probably mostly metal absorption ) , by measuring the power in the wavelength range @xmath54  . using only the primary sample",
    ", we would not be able to compute this term for observed wavelengths below @xmath55  .",
    "we remove several wavelength regions from our analysis because of calibration problems : @xmath56  , @xmath57  , @xmath58  , @xmath59  , and @xmath60 (the last two have no direct effect on the results we present ) .",
    "most of these problems are due to strong sky lines .",
    "our sample was initially examined by eye , and the most extreme broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars were removed ( see @xcite for a discussion of bals ) .",
    "when we first measured the background power in the region @xmath61 , we found that the most extreme outliers in power were still obvious bals ( this was not true of the ly@xmath1 forest  region ) . to test the importance of these systems to our ly@xmath1 forest  power measurement ,",
    "we removed a further 147 quasars using the following automated method : each spectrum is smoothed by a gaussian with rms width @xmath62 .",
    "the continuum within the region @xmath63is redefined by dividing by the mean flux - to - continuum ratio in the region .",
    "a quasar is identified as a bal quasar if the region @xmath63  contains a @xmath64 long continuous set of pixels that all fall more than 20% above or below our estimated continuum ( we initially identified wide regions with flux above the continuum out of simple curiosity , but found that these are in practice almost always obvious bal quasars where the continuum has been biased low by the bal feature ) .",
    "we iterate the continuum redefinition twice , computing the new mean after throwing out pixels more than 20% below the previous mean , but this makes almost no difference to the results .",
    "note that the @xmath65 smoothing was applied to allow easier identification of bals in noisy spectra . as we show below",
    ", this bal cut makes essentially no difference to our @xmath0  result , although it does have a noticeable effect on the power measurement in the region @xmath61 .",
    "sdss obtains multiple ( at least 3 ) exposures for each quasar .",
    "we combine the individual exposure spectra to produce a single spectrum , using a nearest - grid - point method that produces uncorrelated noise and a reasonably well - defined sampling window . for each pixel",
    "we record estimates of wavelength , quasar flux , resolution , sky flux , read - noise , and two different total noise estimates . the first noise estimate , which we will call simply @xmath66 ( @xmath67 for pipeline ) , is computed using the error array given for the exposure spectra by the spectral reduction pipeline .",
    "the second noise estimate , which we call @xmath68 ( @xmath69 for component ) , is computed by summing the read - noise and the noise implied by estimates of the number of photons corresponding to the quasar flux and sky flux .",
    "the two noise estimates generally do not agree , but this is not a problem for us because we ultimately recalibrate the noise ( next ) . finally , we record @xmath70 for each pixel , computed by treating the determination of the combined flux value for each pixel as a one parameter fit to the measurements given by the different exposures .",
    "examples of the more important of these quantities in ly@xmath1 forest regions are shown in figure [ deltafvector ] .",
    "for comparison to the sky and quasar flux levels , we have converted the gaussian read - noise into the flux of photons that would contribute the same noise variance .",
    "several elements of figure [ deltafvector ] ( e.g. , the estimation of the quasar continuum and @xmath71 ) will be described later in this paper .",
    "the noise estimate from the standard sdss pipeline is only approximate .",
    "the accuracy of the noise estimate required for our purpose is much higher than anticipated when the pipeline was developed .",
    "for this reason we use the differences between single - exposure spectra for the same quasar to determine the noise properties of the data .",
    "we construct difference spectra by combining the flux - calibrated exposures with alternating sign for each exposure , i.e. , we use exactly the same procedure that we normally use to produce combined spectra from the exposures , except half of the exposures are subtracted instead of added , so the mean result is zero ( we drop the last exposure when there are an odd number  this is not the most efficient method possible , but we do not need it to be ) . the result is a direct measure of the exposure - to - exposure changes .",
    "we measure the power spectrum of these difference spectra using the method described in  3.1 , including noise subtraction based on the pipeline noise estimates for the pixels .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ diffspecpow ] ( points with error bars ) .",
    "we obtain a clear detection of power , where there should be none if the spectra differ only by the noise estimate from the pipeline which is being subtracted .",
    "if we assume that the noise has been underestimated by a constant factor , and fit for that factor using the error covariance matrix estimated by bootstrap resampling , we find a decent fit : @xmath72 for 107 degrees of freedom ( formally , this fit is not good because @xmath45 is unlikely to be this high by chance ) .",
    "this fit uses our usual points in @xmath73 .",
    "the best fit value of the excess noise contribution is @xmath74% of the original noise estimate , indicating that the rms noise was underestimated by 8% .",
    "the best fit and goodness of fit do not change if we add points on larger scales .",
    "the quality of the fit begins to degrade as we add points with larger @xmath20 , but the best fit value changes by only 1% ( in power ) out to the nyquist frequency of the data .",
    "of course , we have no reason to expect a single redshift - independent factor to describe the relation between the true and pipeline noise , so the formally bad @xmath45 is not a fundamental problem .",
    "we check for systematic change with redshift by allowing a power law dependence , @xmath75^d$ ] , but find no significant detection ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "our final method will effectively account for evolution anyway , as described below .    a @xmath20 dependence different than expected for white noise could be a problem for us , so we check for this by fitting for a power law dependence , @xmath77 [ with @xmath78 , finding @xmath79 , a significant detection ( @xmath45 is now a reasonable 123.3 for 106 dof ) . allowing a running of the power law , @xmath80 ,",
    "does not improve the fit ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the slope we find corresponds to a @xmath82% change in 16% of the noise power at the extremes of our @xmath20 range , i.e. , only @xmath83% of the total noise power , which is a relatively small fraction of the ly@xmath1 forest  power except at the highest @xmath20 ( see figure [ noisefraction ] below ) .",
    "we henceforth assume that the extra noise is proportional to @xmath84 rather than white ( this makes @xmath85% difference in the final results except for the one highest @xmath20 , lowest @xmath86 point where the difference is 2% ) .",
    "how accurate is this noise estimate based on differences between exposures ?",
    "our difference spectra will contain a component of the ly@xmath1 forest  power if the calibration between exposures is not perfect .",
    "the power in this term would be suppressed relative to the ly@xmath1 forest  power by the fractional calibration error squared , so it would be very small unless the exposure - to - exposure calibration errors were quite large .",
    "the fact that a simple one parameter extra - noise model fits reasonably well , in the face of variation in redshift , noise amplitude , and @xmath20 , argues against calibration errors being a big problem .",
    "more convincingly , we measure nearly the same excess noise contribution ( @xmath87% ) and slope ( @xmath88 ) in the region @xmath89   as we do in the ly@xmath1 forest .",
    "this argues against any connection to leaking ly@xmath1",
    "forest  power .",
    "note that the effective absolute level of noise in the @xmath89   region is about half that in the ly@xmath1 forest  region , so this test shows that the fraction of extra noise does not depend strongly on the noise level itself .",
    "pixels in different exposures are not perfectly aligned , and misalignment can allow ly@xmath1 forest  power to leak into our difference spectra . to test this alternative explanation for the apparent excess noise in the spectra",
    ", we split the spectra into two groups with approximately equal weight , based on the rms misalignment in the forest region ( the alignment is known from the wavelength calibration of the exposures , which is thought to be practically perfect ) .",
    "we find the same excess noise power in both the poorly aligned group ( @xmath90% , @xmath91 ) and the better aligned group ( @xmath92% , @xmath93 ) , suggesting that the excess power is not due to misalignment .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a similar level of excess noise power outside of the forest region again argues against leakage .",
    "we therefore believe that our noise estimate is considerably more accurate than the noise estimate from the sdss pipeline .    in our initial power spectrum analysis we multiplied the noise - power estimated from the pipeline errors by the factor 1.16 for all spectra ; however , when we split the data based on the mean value of @xmath70 for the exposure combination ( see  [ secsubsamples ] ) we found that the large and small @xmath70 subsamples disagreed significantly on the @xmath0  results .",
    "we eliminated this problem by estimating the noise - correction factor individually for each spectrum , by fitting to the power in the difference spectrum for that quasar .",
    "the mean extra power from these fits is still close to 16% , but there is considerable scatter .",
    "when we use these individual estimates , the correlation between measured @xmath0  and @xmath70 disappears , i.e , the mean value of @xmath70 for a spectrum s exposure combination was a good indicator of the amount by which the noise in each spectrum was misestimated .",
    "note that there are statistical errors in these noise estimates for each spectrum , of the same order as the error for which we are trying to correct ; however , there is no systematic bias associated with these errors , and the random error they contribute is automatically included in our final bootstrap errors .",
    "in fact , including the spectrum - by - spectrum noise estimate reduces the bootstrap errors slightly on small scales , verifying that these estimates are on average more accurate than the original noise estimates .",
    "it is not known why the noise is misestimated by the standard pipeline .",
    "tests at this level have not been done before .",
    "our final data product will be a measurement of @xmath0binned in @xmath20 and @xmath86 , i.e. , a matrix @xmath94 where @xmath95 labels bins with @xmath96 and @xmath97 labels bins with @xmath98",
    ". we will also give the noise power that was subtracted , @xmath99 , in the same bins .",
    "we suggest allowing a 5% rms freedom in the noise amplitude in each @xmath86 bin when performing model fits , i.e. , for each bin subtract @xmath100 from @xmath94 , and add @xmath101 to @xmath45 .",
    "this is probably overly conservative for any one bin , but implies a combined freedom @xmath102 ( for 9 bins ) on an overall noise misestimation .",
    "this seems prudent , even though it is not really required by any test we have performed .",
    "the resolution of the sdss spectra is estimated using lines from calibration lamps mounted on the telescope structure .",
    "shifts of the detector pixel grid relative to a fixed observed wavelength frame during an exposure , which we will call flexure , are expected to be the dominant source of error in this spectral resolution estimate .",
    "we tried estimating the rate of shifting for each pixel by differencing the wavelength calibrations of adjacent exposures ( this calibration is determined very precisely for each exposure using the positions of sky lines ) .",
    "the implied extra smoothing only changes the power by @xmath103% at our highest @xmath20 bin .    the strong sky line at 5577    provides a good opportunity to measure the resolution more directly ( note that the spectral wavelengths are in vacuum , and heliocentric , so this and other sky lines generally appear shifted from their standard wavelength ) .",
    "we measure the power spectrum in @xmath12 sky spectra in the range @xmath104 .",
    "if the sky line has negligible width and the smoothing has a gaussian shape with rms width @xmath105 , the power spectrum should be proportional to @xmath106 [ \\sin(k~l/2)/(k~l/2)]^2 $ ] , where @xmath107 is the pixel width ( the pixelization effect is subdominant but not negligible ) . in figure [ skypower5579 ]",
    "we show the measured power averaged over all the sky spectra after dividing each individual measurement by @xmath108 , where @xmath105 and @xmath107 are the local values ( they are to a good approximation constant over the range we are looking at ) , and also dividing each measurement by the value at a low @xmath20 where the resolution should not have any effect .",
    "the result is remarkably close to unity , indicating that the estimated resolution is an accurate representation of the true resolution .",
    "what are the small wiggles ?",
    "figure [ zoom5579 ] shows an example of the region we fourier transform to measure the power .",
    "we believe the small features to the sides of the main line are oh lines at 5564 and 5589   @xcite .",
    "we test this explanation for the wiggles by constructing mock sky spectra that simply have a delta function at 5579  and two more with 0.003 times the main line s amplitude at 5566 and 5591  , convolved with the resolution and pixelization ( 0.003 was chosen to give the best fit to the wiggles ) .",
    "the red , dotted line in figure [ skypower5579 ] shows the same resolution test using the mocks .",
    "we see that the wiggles are essentially perfectly reproduced . in conclusion",
    ": the resolution profile appears to be perfectly gaussian , with exactly the width expected from the given resolution .",
    "there is apparently no room for even a 2% level effect from flexure .",
    "we are prevented from performing the same kind of measurement using other sky lines by similar features which are always much larger relative to the central line .",
    "we suggest that fits to @xmath0  include a multiplicative uncertainty on the overall power , of the form @xmath109 , where @xmath1 is a single parameter in the fit subject to the rms constraint @xmath110 .",
    "this allows for a @xmath103% change in the smoothing kernel at our highest @xmath20 , similar to our estimate of the error from flexure .",
    "this error estimate is somewhat arbitrary , but the evidence we have presented suggests that it should be smaller , so our estimate is conservative .",
    "note that this resolution test , and the noise calibration , can not be used directly with the standard pipeline spectra , where the exposures are combined in a different way .",
    "the reader may be confused at this point about how our spectra differ from the standard publicly available set , so we give the following summary :    * our nearest - grid - point combination of the exposures produces uncorrelated noise in pixels ( to the extent that the noise in the exposures was uncorrelated , which is expected from the way they are extracted ) , while the standard pipeline uses a local splining procedure which does a good but not perfect job of preventing noise correlation . * when combining exposures we record the effect of different pixel sizes , misalignment of the pixels , and flexure of the detector during exposures , which can influence the effective resolution .",
    "* we record the contribution of quasar flux , sky flux , and read - noise to the total noise in each pixel . knowing the contribution from quasar flux is important if pixel - by - pixel noise weighting is to be used , because the correlation between flux level and noise amplitude can lead to biases ( see the end of  [ secmeandiv ] ) .",
    "* we correct for the bias in the exposure combination associated with cross - correlation between the noise variance level in exposure pixels and the quasar flux in the pixel ( a different incarnation of the problem alluded to in the previous point ) . *",
    "the noise is recalibrated for each spectrum by differencing the exposures .",
    "the noise variance in the standard pipeline exposure spectra is underestimated by on average 16% , on top of any error related to the exposure combination , and the power measured in the difference spectra is slightly tilted relative to white noise .",
    "the last point is the most important .",
    "our goal is to measure the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the transmitted flux fraction through the igm , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath113 is the ly@xmath1 forest  optical depth ( as defined in  1 ) .",
    "however , the spectrum of each quasar is the product of @xmath114 and the quasar continuum ( note that we use `` continuum '' to refer to all the flux emitted by the quasar , including emission lines ) , further complicated by errors in the detector calibration and absorption by longer wavelength transitions .",
    "the details of the procedure we use to separate these contributions will be presented elsewhere , here we give the basic idea and key results that are relevant for the flux power spectrum determination .",
    "we use an iterative procedure to determine the components of the data model @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the raw flux in pixel @xmath95 , @xmath117 is the noise , @xmath118 is the overall normalization of the quasar spectrum , @xmath119 is the mean quasar continuum shape , @xmath120 are fluctuations around the mean continuum , @xmath121 is a mean generalized calibration vector ( this includes wavelength dependent calibration errors in the sdss spectra , but also the mean absorption by metal lines with resonance wavelength @xmath122 ) , @xmath123 are fluctuations around @xmath124 , such as individual metal lines or variable calibration errors , @xmath125 is the mean ly@xmath1 forest  absorption at a given redshift , and @xmath126 are the fluctuations in ly@xmath1 forest  absorption . note that here , as most places in this paper , @xmath127 is the redshift of gas that would produce ly@xmath1  absorption in the pixel , not the redshift of the quasar .",
    "briefly , we determine @xmath118 for each spectrum , the global functions @xmath119 , @xmath121 , and @xmath125 , and a set of principal component analysis ( pca ) eigenvectors that describe @xmath120 by , in turn , computing each component of the model from all the spectra while holding all the others fixed .",

    "we have tried several different values for n ranging from 0 to 13 , and find that the power spectrum results depend slightly ( but not critically ) on the value , as we discuss below . for our final results we use @xmath131 , i.e. , we only divide by a mean continuum , although we will also show how using @xmath132 affects the cosmological fit results .",
    "we do not use the pca continua because we are not satisfied with their robustness , and division by them frequently actually increases the resulting power slightly .",
    "this may indicate that the error introduced by allowing additional freedom in the continuum is larger than the continuum fluctuations that we are trying to remove .",
    "our study of pca continua was primarily aimed at determining @xmath125 rather than the power spectrum , so we can not be certain that the pca method could not be used productively in a power spectrum measurement if it was more carefully optimized for that application . because we know that our continuum estimate ( which involves an extrapolation from outside the ly@xmath1 forest  region ) is not perfect within the ly@xmath1 forest , we further divide each chunk of spectrum that will be used to make a power spectrum estimate by its mean ( optimally computed considering both observational noise and absorption variance ) .",
    "we call our resulting observed data vector @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the normalized noise fluctuation and we are ignoring the cross - terms between @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 . as we describe in detail below ,",

    "the original noise estimate is @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the flux from the quasar , @xmath145 is the flux from the sky , and @xmath146 accounts for the conversion between the units of flux and photons ( this description is slightly idealized since the reduction of two - dimensional ccd data to a spectrum introduces some complications ) . to remove the correlation between flux and noise",

    "we make a final , very small , correction to the mean estimation based on a direct computation of the cross - correlation between the flux and noise amplitude .",
    "we use the same decorrelated noise amplitudes for weighting the power spectrum extraction ( discussed below ) ; however , the bias is completely insignificant in that case ( i.e. , @xmath0   computed using the original noise estimates for weighting is practically identical ) .",

    "the noise term in equation ( [ expectdeltaf ] ) is relatively easy to compute and subtract .",

    "as it appears in @xmath158 , @xmath86 is the redshift of gas that would produce ly@xmath1  absorption in this part of the quasar spectrum , if it was not at a higher redshift than the quasar , i.e. , @xmath86 is really just an indicator of observed wavelength . the subtraction in equation ( [ backsubeq ] ) will completely remove the power due to transitions with @xmath159  , including siiv ( a doublet absorbing at rest wavelengths 1393.75 and 1402.77  ) and civ ( another doublet at 1548.20 and 1550.78  ) . note that this subtraction of metal power is exact , not an approximation [ except for the approximation that @xmath160 , because we are determining the metal power in exactly the same observed wavelength range as the ly@xmath1 forest  power from which it is being subtracted , i.e. , the same gas , at the same redshift , is doing the absorbing both inside and outside the forest , so the absorption will have identical statistical properties .",
    "this background subtraction will also remove any strictly observed - wavelength - dependent power introduced by the detector , such as spectrum to spectrum variations in the calibration of the detector .",
    "we implement it in  [ secbacksubtract ] .      in this subsection",
    "we describe our method for extracting the power spectrum , @xmath161 , from any selected rest wavelength range @xmath162 (  [ secbandpowerest ] ) , and estimating its statistical uncertainty (  [ secbootstrap ] ) .",

    "this method is optimal for a gaussian probability distribution . while the power spectrum estimates are not gaussian distributed , the deviations are small , as shown below .",
    "we measure the power in flat bands with edges given by @xmath164 where @xmath95 ranges from 0 to 30 ( to produce 29 bands ) , although we will not give results for some of the large and small - scale bands when we think they are unreliable . defining @xmath165 , where @xmath166 are the fluctuations we are measuring ( e.g. , @xmath167 within the forest ) and @xmath134 are the normalized noise fluctuations , a band - power estimate , @xmath168 , for each chunk of spectrum is given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 is the fisher matrix and the noise bias is @xmath175 note that we could include the background power explicitly in these equations as a noise source when measuring the power in the ly@xmath1 forest  region , but we ignore this because its contribution is too small to change the weighting significantly",

    "the noise subtraction term , @xmath176 , is computed using the pipeline noise estimates , @xmath66 ( not @xmath71 ) , with the amplitude corrected as discussed above based on the differences between exposures . in principle , @xmath177 in these equations should be the true covariance matrix ; however , as we discuss below , we use the measured covariance from a previous iteration of the power spectrum determination instead .    except in a few cases that we will identify as they arise , when we set out to measure the power in a defined rest - wavelength region ( e.g. , @xmath178   for the ly@xmath1 forest   region ) we first use equation ( [ pestimator ] ) to estimate the power separately in halves of the region in each spectrum ( e.g. , @xmath179   and @xmath180  ) .",
    "our choice of half - spectra is a compromise between competing desires for resolution in redshift and wavenumber .",
    "the full length of the forest in a spectrum corresponds to a redshift interval , @xmath181 , that is unnecessarily large . while the precision of the measured power spectrum would support smaller than half - spectrum chunks to give finer redshift resolution than @xmath182",
    ", the shorter chunks would limit the @xmath20-space resolution .",
    "note that we could have used full chunks and still achieved the same @xmath86-resolution by more carefully applying the estimator equation , as we discuss below , but this would increase the computational time without much improvement in the final errors on the scales of relevance .",
    "after computing estimates @xmath168 for each half - spectrum , we perform a weighted average to determine @xmath161  in redshift bins centered at @xmath183 where @xmath184 ( in this paper we only present results up to @xmath185 ) .",
    "each bin is the average of the power in all the half - spectra for which the redshift of the central pixel falls within @xmath186 of the bin center ( we discuss below how we correct for an asymmetric distribution of data within a bin ) .",
    "we combine sets of estimates using the fisher matrices ( equation [ fishmat ] ) for the weighting . in practice",
    "this means that we sum the quantity in parentheses in equation ( [ pestimator ] ) over all estimates and multiply the result by the inverse of the sum of the fisher matrices for each individual estimate .",
    "our procedure would be optimal for gaussian data , which the ly@xmath1 forest  is not ; however , when we use the gaussian approximation to compute the errors on the measured power the results are not much different from the more accurate bootstrap errors ( see  [ secbootstrap ] ) , so we conclude that our method is not far from optimal .    whenever we have a finite length of spectrum ,",
    "there will be mixing between the power in different bins .",
    "variable noise or gaps in the data will produce more mixing .",
    "this mixing is described in terms of a window matrix , which is given by the fisher matrix in equation [ fishmat ] . in our standard procedure , the power spectrum estimates in equation [ pestimator ]",
    "are multiplied with the inverse of fisher matrix and are thus deconvolved with the window , which removes the mixing of other modes into the bin one is estimating ( however , the bins are still correlated ) .",
    "this method thus produces a diagonal window matrix , so each combined estimate of @xmath161  represents exactly the range of @xmath20 corresponding to its bin .",
    "our tests below show that there is no practical problem with instability in the fisher matrix inversion ( the window matrices are close to diagonal to begin with ) .",
    "a diagonal window matrix is desirable from a theoretical standpoint because our ability to compute the power spectrum from simulations is limited at both low @xmath20 ( by limited box size ) and high @xmath20 ( by simulation resolution and complexity of physics ) . in the few cases where we use the power without deconvolution",
    ", we are using the estimator @xmath187 , where @xmath188 @xcite .    to compute the weight matrix @xmath142",
    ", we need an estimate of @xmath177 , i.e. , the power spectrum we are trying to measure .",
    "we solve this problem by computing @xmath161  iteratively .",
    "the first estimate is made assuming @xmath189 . in subsequent iterations",
    "we compute @xmath177 from the previous estimate of @xmath161 .",
    "this procedure converges quickly ( the difference between @xmath189 and a reasonable estimate of @xmath177 is significant , but once @xmath177 is in the right ballpark it does not matter what it is exactly ) .",
    "we add a large constant ( 10.0 ) to all elements of the weight matrix , to remove all direct sensitivity of our power measurement to the mean of the chunk .",
    "this makes very little difference to the results on the scales we present .",
    "we are however still sensitive to the mean estimate from when we divided the spectrum by it .",
    "even if the mean estimates are correct on average , the statistical error on the mean for each spectrum can still lead to a bias .",
    "if the errors on the mean estimate were small and uncorrelated with the fluctuations in the flux field , the bias would be @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the error on the mean [ to lowest order in @xmath191 , i.e. , the bias is @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the fractional error in the mean , and @xmath194 .",
    "we divide each estimate by this factor as part of our standard procedure ; however , as we discuss below when we test our code on mock spectra , this approximation is not sufficient and we will need to include another small , @xmath20-dependent , factor determined numerically using the mock spectra ( this is the only use of the mock spectra other than for testing ) .    the reader may at this point be wondering what redshift the resulting @xmath195 should be taken to represent , i.e. , @xmath96 is not necessarily the center of weight of the data , and neither is the mean redshift of the pixels in the bin , considering the rather complicated weighting in equation ( [ pestimator ] ) .",
    "in fact , the effective redshift is not even the same for each @xmath20-bin in the same @xmath86-bin .",
    "we resolve this question  @xmath195 represents the power spectrum at precisely @xmath96 ( to first order )  in our construction of @xmath196 and @xmath197 , where @xmath198 and @xmath199 label pixels at redshifts @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and @xmath95 labels the redshift bin in which this chunk of spectrum falls . to account for the evolution from @xmath200 and @xmath201 to @xmath96 ,",

    "finally , @xmath207 . this correction may be difficult to understand intuitively at first , but it is really quite simple .",
    "the modification of @xmath208 just corrects the power spectrum estimate for the excess ( dearth ) of power that we expect for pixels in the high ( low ) redshift ends of the bin .",
    "the correction to @xmath177 affects the weighting , simply producing a more accurate @xmath177 at the redshift of the pixels in question .",
    "note that an alternative method would be to treat the points @xmath195 as simply parameters of a continuous power spectrum defined by some form of interpolation .",
    "this would mean @xmath209 would have non - zero derivative with respect to more than one of the power spectrum bins ( e.g. , usually two for linear interpolation ) .",
    "this method would be elegant , and probably produce narrower effective window functions in the @xmath86 direction ; however , it will increase the correlation in the @xmath86 direction between measurement errors , because the same pixels would contribute to more than one power spectrum point . since this more sophisticated method would allow long chunks of spectra to be used without degrading our @xmath86 resolution , it would be most useful if we were trying to measure the power on even larger scales .",
    "how does our method compare to the straightforward fourier transform ( ft ) method ?",
    "the basic ft method is to project the data vector , @xmath28 , onto a set of modes of the form @xmath210 , and to simply compute the variance of the amplitudes of all the modes with @xmath20 in some bin , i.e. , @xmath211 where @xmath212 and @xmath213 define the bin , and the discrete spacing of @xmath214 is somewhat arbitrary ( the natural spacing is @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the length of the spectrum , but nothing prevents one from choosing more finely spaced @xmath20s )",
    ". our estimator , equation ( [ pestimator ] ) , can be cast in a similar form , i.e. , as a projection of the data vector onto a set of modes , and a sum of the squares of the mode amplitudes .",
    "we require that the mode amplitudes are statistically independent , which makes their computation equivalent to a computation of karhunen - love eigenmodes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ demoestimator ] shows the two most important modes for our bin with @xmath217 , for the chunk of spectrum shown in figure [ deltafvector]a .    in this case",
    "two modes differing primarily by a phase shift , analogous to @xmath218 and @xmath219 , contain most of the information , because our bin width is approximately @xmath220 .",
    "we see that the difference between our modes and a simple sine wave is not dramatic ",
    "there is a little bit of edge tapering ( downweighting the edges to make the effective window on the data more compact in fourier space ) and some straightforward downweighting of the most noisy pixels .",
    "curiously , there seems to be an additional effect where pixels adjacent to an edge are given extra weight , possibly as a way of compensating for missing data ( this is seen more clearly in spectra where a narrow gap is present in the middle of the data ) .",
    "the picture is similar for bins with larger @xmath20 , except of course that there are increasingly many important modes as the width of our bins increases ( the bins have a fixed width @xmath221 , but the relevant mode width is @xmath222 ) . for more discussion of the quadratic estimator",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the method we adopt is optimal for gaussian fields and therefore guarantees that no other method can surpass it .",
    "an additional advantage is that within this formalism window and covariance matrices are automatically computed . for continuous spectra with few gaps and near uniform noise one",
    "does not necessarily expect an ft method to be significantly worse . in practice",
    "the noise level is slowly varying across the spectrum , so averaging all the pixels uniformly is not optimal and degrades performance .",
    "another advantage is that with our method each pixel pair has its own effective redshift and the correlations for a given pair are then interpolated to the redshift of interest using the appropriate evolution . in the ft method",
    "the whole spectrum is fourier transformed first , so the redshift information is preserved only in an averaged sense , but a priori it is not clear how this average is defined .      while the fisher matrix obtained during the estimation process would give the error matrix for @xmath161  if the data were gaussian , we can not reliably assume this .",
    "our solution is to compute a bootstrap error matrix by the standard procedure ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) . from our data set of @xmath223 spectra",
    ", we form a bootstrap data set by selecting @xmath223 spectra at random , with replacement . the covariance matrix of @xmath161  is taken to be @xmath224 , where @xmath225",

    "we generally use 4000 realizations , after checking that this produces convergence in the result .",
    "we assume that the error correlations extend only one bin off diagonal in the @xmath86 direction , because the spectrum of a single quasar practically never contributes to non - adjacent bins .",
    "we have no compelling reason to believe that this method of computing the error bars will give rigorously correct results . considering the large number of off - diagonal elements that must be estimated",
    ", one worry is that a particular linear combination of the bins may accidentally vary very little in our data set , so it will appear to have an unrealistically small error .",
    "our tests on mock spectra (  [ sectestboot ] ) show no sign of this problem .",
    "still , to be conservative we apply one tweak to @xmath228 after it is computed , in an attempt to inoculate it against the possibility .",
    "we perform a singular - value decomposition on @xmath228 , which produces a set of independent vectors and their variances .",
    "we then compute the variances of the same vectors under the gaussian approximation , using the fisher matrix .",

    "we start with the term we divide by before computing the power spectrum , @xmath230 ( see equation [ datamodel ] ) .",
    "we multiply this by @xmath229 ( generated as described below ) , smooth the result using the resolution from the observed spectrum , and sample the result onto the observed grid of pixels .",

    "we add flux from the sky as estimated for the observed spectrum , and transform the total flux to the number of photons that would be expected in each pixel .",
    "we generate a poisson deviate with this mean , add the appropriate gaussian read - noise for each pixel , transform back to the original flux units , and subtract the sky flux estimate to obtain an observed ( noisy ) quasar spectrum .",
    "the results of this procedure for each observed quasar are written into files in the same format as the observed spectra , so exactly the same code can be used to measure the power in the mock spectra .    to generate the @xmath229 fields we use a simple model that is arranged to give roughly the correct power spectrum as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath86 , and the correct mean absorption as a function of redshift .",

    "we determine the true @xmath0 by a simple fft of extremely long @xmath229 fields ( without redshift evolution ) .      without accurate statistical errors",
    "it is difficult to identify systematic problems , so we first test our bootstrap procedure for estimating the errors .",

    "finally , figure [ ratio1558 ] shows @xmath294 , past the wavelength of civ absorption .",
    "the reduction of power relative to shorter wavelengths is dramatic , but not surprising since civ is the most common metal absorber .",
    "it does suggest however that most of the power is due to metals and not continuum fluctuations , unless the continuum in the range 1558 - 1774 has significantly less power relative to other intervals studied here ( which is admittedly not inconceivable ) .",

    "the procedure we describe next would remove this power .    since we know that @xmath282 depends on noise it seems logical to subtract the value of @xmath282 corresponding to the level of noise in the forest , rather than the best measured value of @xmath282 , which is dominated in practice by data with less noise .",
    "if we had simply misestimated the noise by an overall factor , for example , the errors in @xmath272 and @xmath282 would cancel for this form of subtraction .",
    "to implement this idea , we model the background subtraction term as a linear function of the noise level , @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the mean noise level in the data computed in the same way as the mean flux level ( this is the mean of the normalized noise , i.e. , after division by continuum and mean flux ) .",
    "the choice of a linear relation is arbitrary but it does the job ( see  [ secsubsamples ] ) better than the alternatives we tried .",
    "we compute @xmath298 and @xmath271 for each value of @xmath20 and @xmath86 using a linear fit to the full sample of spectra that probe @xmath158 , weighted by the gaussian estimate of the error on each point for each spectrum .",

    "the reader who is paying attention may complain that we have no compelling reason to believe that this source of noise - dependent power that we do not understand depends on noise in the same way inside and outside the ly@xmath1 forest  region .",

    "this would be a remarkable coincidence if our model for the subtraction was not substantially correct .",

    "we see ( fig . [ nobinzcorrat ] ) that this correction mostly affects the lowest redshift bin ( where the low-@xmath86 edge of the bin is empty of data ) and has little effect on the fit ( not surprisingly , leaving out this correction increases @xmath45 ) .",
    "the line `` ignore @xmath376 correlation '' in table [ modtab ] shows the change in the fitted parameters if we naively use the given noise estimates for weighting without accounting for the fact that there is a correlation between the flux estimate and the noise amplitude estimate for each pixel .",
    "figure [ nosopherrrat ] shows that the bias is a fairly constant 3 - 5% increase in the flux power .",
    "the difference is not actually caused by the change in weighting used in the power spectrum estimation ",
    "instead , the power is biased high because the estimation of the mean that each chunk of spectrum is divided by is biased low because low - flux pixels have smaller noise estimates .",
    "ignoring this effect does not change our fit results .",
    "normally we base our estimation of the amount of the noise that is due to quasar flux on the separate estimates we have from the spectral reduction pipeline for the flux , sky , and read - noise contributions , however these estimates do not add up to the total noise reported by the pipeline .",
    "if we rescale the individual numbers to make them consistent with the total ( not necessarily the correct thing to do ) we see that the fit results are not changed significantly ( the line `` rescale @xmath68 ''  we use @xmath68 to refer to noise computed using the separate flux , sky , and read - noise estimates ) , although the power does change by as much as 3% ( fig .",
    "[ nobelievephotrat ]  this difference would be a bit larger if we did not directly measure and correct for the cross - correlation between the noise amplitude and flux ) .",
    "finally , our power spectrum extraction code has a bias ( partially related to division by the mean of each chunk of spectrum ) , that we correct for by dividing the result by equation [ codebiaseq ] . removing this correction decreases the estimated @xmath310 by about @xmath288 and increases the amplitude by a similar amount .",
    "the combined change is actually quite significant because it is transverse to the degeneracy direction for these parameters .",
    "to summarize , most of the effects described above are small relative to the statistical errors on the final estimated parameters .",
    "we understand the cases where the difference is significant , and expect that our standard method will be much more accurate than the difference between it and the variants ( we show these variants to help the reader better understand our measurement ) .",
    "these tests give us confidence that the final results are very robust to small changes in the analysis pipeline .",
    "how sensitive are these conclusions to our assumptions about the nuisance parameters , @xmath327 , @xmath377 , and @xmath146 , i.e. , if these constraints improve in the future , will we need to worry more about systematic errors in @xmath0 ?",
    "we investigate this by first fixing all the parameters in the fit ( including removing the noise amplitude uncertainty , resolution uncertainty , and freedom in the siiii correction ) , so the only uncertainty is on @xmath0 .",
    "table [ modtab ] ( the `` fixed nuisance parameters '' line ) shows that the error on the amplitude improves dramatically , by a factor of 5 .",
    "the error on @xmath310 improves by a factor of 2 .",
    "so in principle the amplitude error can be improved a lot relative to potential systematic errors , and @xmath310 improved as well ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the next line ( `` optimistic @xmath327 '' ) , where we assume the hires constraint on @xmath327 is improved by a factor of 5 , and the sdss constraint by a factor of 2 , shows that @xmath309 is substantially degenerate with @xmath327 ( as expected ) , but @xmath310 is less degenerate . improving the constraints on @xmath377 and @xmath146 by factors of 5 , in addition to the improved constraints on @xmath327 , leads to little further improvement . finally , for comparison , we tried simply reducing the errors on @xmath0  by a factor of @xmath378 , and found that the error on @xmath310 decreases by almost the same factor ( 1.6 ) , but the error on @xmath309 decreases less ( a factor of 1.2 )",
    ". sdss will collect a factor of @xmath83 more data than we have in the present sample .",

    "the extraordinary size of the data sample leads to an order of magnitude reduction in errors compared to previous analyses .",
    "consequently , to do justice to this data set requires a much more careful analysis than was needed in the past . to this end",
    "we have developed a new analysis pipeline using quadratic power spectrum estimation with near optimal performance .",
    "we applied this analysis to realistic mock spectra and demonstrated ( after several tweaks ) that the method performs as expected .",
    "we emphasize that realistic mock spectra are essential if one is to trust the results at the level of precision allowed by this data set .",
    "our error estimation is based on bootstrap resampling , which works well here because the individual quasars are independent of each other .",
    "the errors were tested against mock spectra and found to be accurate .",
    "we also compared the bootstrap errors to gaussian errors , finding them to be in general less than 20% higher than gaussian .",
    "given the small errors on the recovered flux power spectrum the required control of systematic effects must be improved correspondingly as well .",
    "a significant part of this paper is devoted to this issue .",
    "we find several sources of contamination present in the data and develop methods to remove them .",
    "metal absorption for metals with rest wavelength transitions above @xmath580 , uncertainties in sky subtraction , and calibration errors can be subtracted essentially exactly by measuring the power on the red side of ly@xmath1 forest using the same observed wavelength range .",
    "we search for a contribution from metals with transitions close to ly-@xmath1 using a correlation function analysis , assuming that they are correlated with hydrogen .",
    "we find clear evidence of siiii contamination and develop a simple and effective scheme to remove it .",
    "this procedure improves the @xmath45 of the fit from 194 to 129 for @xmath581 degrees of freedom and is thus necessary for a satisfactory fit .",
    "we find no evidence of any other metal line contribution to the background subtracted flux power spectrum .",
    "we reduce any contribution of the continuum to the flux power spectrum by dividing each spectrum by the mean quasar continuum",
    ". if contributions from quasar - to - quasar continuum differences are similar in different regions of the spectrum , then our subtraction of power from the red side of ly@xmath1 , as described above , should remove them .",
    "several tests suggest that any residual contributions from continuum fluctuations are negligible .",
    "first , we measure the power in the mean continuum in several rest frame regions , finding it to be always small relative to our error bars , so power in quasar - to - quasar fluctuations has to be larger than power in the mean continuum itself to be significant .",
    "second , measurements of the background in several rest frame regions place upper limits on the fluctuations in those regions .",
    "third , a split of the ly@xmath1 forestregion into two halves reveals no evidence that residual continuum fluctuations differ from one half to the other . finally , estimating the continuum",
    "quasar - by - quasar using a principal component analysis does not change the power spectrum results significantly .    in section",
    " 4 we perform a series of tests to verify the robustness of the analysis against several modifications of the standard procedure and splits of the data .",
    "this reveals an interesting correlation between the power in the red side and the average noise ( and some other properties of the spectra that correlate with noise , like the amplitude of the sky flux relative to the quasar flux ) . while we do not have a detailed explanation for this effect , we are able to remove it by modifying the standard procedure to include this correlation . from our full battery of tests , we conclude that systematic effects in the power spectrum measurement are not likely to significantly affect the results of cosmological fitting ( i.e. , it is likely that some effects remain formally significant relative to the errors on @xmath0 , but the shape of these systematic errors does not seem to correspond to a change in the cosmological parameters ) .",
    "this conclusion is further confirmed by the analysis of different subsets , which do not reveal any systematic deviations from those expected statistically .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to the analysis of the flux power spectrum , without attempting to compare it to cosmological models .",
    "the results of this paper should thus be fairly noncontroversial and can be used by others who wish to perform their own cosmological analysis .",
    "our own analysis will be presented in a separate publication , as will the cosmological implications that follow from it .",
    "we note that the expected error on the linear rms amplitude of fluctuations is @xmath582% and on the slope is @xmath583 , both at the pivot point @xmath584 .",
    "this should be compared to 10% error on the amplitude and 0.04 on the slope from the wmap data at @xmath585 @xcite .",
    "this data set provides very tight constraints on the amplitude and slope of the matter power spectrum .",
    "many additional analyses can be performed using this data set , among them the mean flux evolution , cross - correlations between close pairs , and a bispectrum measurement .",
    "these will provide a wealth of additional information both on cosmology and on the state of the intergalactic medium at @xmath579 , and they will allow us to test the basic picture of the ly@xmath1 forest  that has emerged over the last decade .",
