    "this dense orbit is a torsor over @xmath4 , so arithmetic toric varieties are normal equivariant compactifications of torsors . extending scalars to a finite galois extension @xmath1 over which @xmath4 splits , @xmath5 becomes a split toric variety @xmath6 for some fan @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath3 is a @xmath0-form of the toric variety @xmath8 .",

    "* iii ) or section  [ s : galcoh ] ) . in general galois cohomology classifies what are called twisted forms of @xmath9 , and a twisted form @xmath3 descends to a variety over @xmath0 if and only if every @xmath12-orbit in @xmath3 is contained in some affine open subset .",

    "we offer a simple condition which implies that a twisted form descends to a variety over @xmath0 .",
    "a toric automorphism gives an automorphism of the corresponding lattice @xmath15 preserving the fan @xmath7 . writing @xmath16 for the group of such automorphisms , we have maps of algebraic groups @xmath17 which in turn induce maps of galois cohomology sets @xmath18 the last galois cohomology set classifies @xmath0-tori that split over @xmath10 , and the fiber of the map @xmath19 over a given element @xmath20 in @xmath21 classifies the different twisted forms of the toric variety for the torus @xmath22 associated to @xmath23 . in theorem",

    "huruguen also gives several examples , including a three - dimensional toric variety , which do not satisfy descent .",
    "this is significantly more general than our work in that it applies to spherical varieties and it addresses the issue of descent , but it is also more restrictive in that it requires a @xmath0-rational point .",
    "this is essentially the same restriction as in the work of voskresenski and it rules out many examples such as the brauer - severi varieties of subsection  [ s : realp1 ] .    a toric variety @xmath8 is a geometric invariant theory quotient of @xmath34 , the vector space with basis the rays of @xmath7  @xcite . after possibly replacing @xmath10 by a field extension ,",

    "we illustrate this when @xmath12 is a cyclic group , and use that to classify @xmath1-forms of projective space for a cyclic extension @xmath10 of @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : surf ] we compute the galois cohomology sets for fans in @xmath36 , which classifies arithmetic toric surfaces .",
    "in forthcoming work  @xcite , we use this classification when @xmath37 to compute the @xmath38-equivariant cohomology of real toric varieties  and plan to use it to investigate more refined equivariant invariants such as bredon cohomology  @xcite .",
    "similar ideas should enable the computation of @xmath39-equivariant cohomology of toric varieties that split over the field extension @xmath1 .",
