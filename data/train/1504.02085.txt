    "a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) on a lattice is an open , connected path on the lattice that does not revisit any previously visited vertex .",
    "walks are considered distinct if they are not translates of one another .",
    "if we let the number of saws of @xmath0 steps be @xmath1 , it is known that @xmath2 exists  @xcite , where @xmath3 is the _ growth constant _ of self - avoiding walks on the lattice .",
    "this work will consider saws on the @xmath4-dimensional simple cubic lattice @xmath5 with the vertices having integer coordinates @xmath6 for @xmath7    the upper half - space @xmath8 is characterised by @xmath9 an @xmath0-step _ bridge _ is a self - avoiding walk in the upper half - space that starts at the origin and is constrained so that @xmath10 for any @xmath11 .",
    "we denote the number of @xmath0-step bridges starting at the origin by @xmath12 .",
    "it is known that @xmath13 where @xmath3 is unchanged from the corresponding value for saws  @xcite .    a terminally attached self - avoiding walk , or taw , is a saw with one end anchored in the surface , but with the rest of the walk free in the upper half - space .",
    "terminally attached self - avoiding walks are also referred to as half - space self - avoiding walks in the literature .",
    "clearly taws are a superset of bridges , and a subset of saws , so have the same growth constant .",
    "the number of @xmath0-step taws starting at the origin is denoted by @xmath14    the last subset of saws we wish to consider are _",
    "arches _ , which are saws in the upper half - space with both the start- and end - point constrained to lie in the @xmath15-dimensional surface @xmath16 . that is to say",
    ", @xmath17 as the number of arches is bounded above by the number of saws and below by the number of self - avoiding polygons ( saps ) , which are known to have the same growth constant as saws  @xcite , it follows that arches also have the same growth constant as saws .",
    "the number of @xmath0-step arches starting at the origin is denoted by @xmath18    the results on growth constants are the only results that have been proved .",
    "nevertheless , it is universally accepted that the asymptotic behaviour of the above objects is given by : @xmath19 for saws , bridges , taws and arches respectively .",
    "the existence of the various critical exponents has not been proved , but is universally accepted , and will be assumed hereinafter .",
    "all the above definitions also hold for the two - dimensional square lattice , where the upper half - space referred to becomes the upper half - plane , and the originating surface is the line @xmath20    another critical exponent that needs to be defined is that which characterises the length of a saw .",
    "all standard measures of the square of the length , such as the mean - squared end - to - end distance , the radius of gyration , the squared caliper span etc .",
    ", behave as @xmath21 where in two dimensions it is accepted that @xmath22 this exponent can also be understood as the reciprocal of the fractal dimension , @xmath23    in two dimensions , the exponents are known exactly ( assuming existence ) . in that case it is believed that @xmath24 @xmath25 , and @xmath26 as far as we are aware , there are no published estimates for @xmath27 but as long ago as last millennium one of us ( ajg ) estimated the value of this exponent by series analysis to be @xmath28 subsequently , much longer series have been produced by iwan jensen , which enabled this estimate to be affirmed with much greater confidence . somewhat later",
    ", alberts and madras ( private communication ) obtained the estimate @xmath29 for two - dimensional bridges through sle arguments , subject to certain unproven assumptions , but this work was never published .    in",
    "@xcite both saws spanning a strip and bridges were discussed , and comparisons made with conjectured results from @xmath30 the arguments given there allow one to predict @xmath27 and they are reproduced , in summary , here . in  @xcite it was explained why the measure of bridges starting at the origin and ending at @xmath31 should be @xmath32 for an ( explicit ) function @xmath33 that decays exponentially .",
    "summing over all values of @xmath34 it follows that the measure of bridges starting at the origin and ending at height @xmath35 should be asymptotic to a constant times @xmath36 then by integrating over height , the measure of bridges of height less than or equal to @xmath35 should grow as @xmath37    recall that for two - dimensional saws and bridges the exponent @xmath38 if we weight each bridge of length @xmath0 by @xmath39 , so that the normalised counts are given by @xmath40 , it follows that normalised bridges of height @xmath35 typically have @xmath41 steps",
    ". hence the measure of bridges of @xmath0 steps should be the same as the measure of bridges of height at most @xmath42 , which gives @xmath43 for the measure .",
    "equivalently , the number of bridges of exactly @xmath0 steps grows like @xmath44 so that @xmath45    these exponents are not all independent .",
    "there is a scaling relation , due to barber  @xcite , @xmath46 which holds independent of dimension .",
    "very recently , duplantier and guttmann  @xcite have proposed the existence of another scaling relation giving the bridge exponent , @xmath47 as expected , the exponents given above for two - dimensional saws satisfy both these relations .    in three dimensions",
    "the most precise estimates we have are from the monte carlo work of one of us  @xcite , with @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 though the details of the monte carlo simulation for the estimation of @xmath51 have not yet been published . for @xmath52",
    "there are a few estimates in the literature based on rather short series .",
    "some 30 years ago , guttmann and torrie  @xcite estimated @xmath53 while the most recent monte carlo estimate is by grassberger  @xcite who estimated @xmath54 from barber s scaling relation this gives @xmath55    there is renewed interest in the values of the exponents @xmath52 and @xmath56 in this case , as the former exponent arises in recent tests for the conformal invariance of 3d saws  @xcite , and the latter has been predicted by the recent scaling argument  @xcite given above , and estimation of the exponent @xmath56 would be a useful test of that scaling relation . more precisely , kennedy discusses the hitting density of a saw in a connected domain when conformally mapped by a function @xmath33 to another domain .",
    "the hitting densities with respect to arc length in the two domains are related by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a critical exponent , identified by scaling arguments as @xmath59 note that the above exponent estimates give the prediction @xmath60 compared to kennedy s direct monte carlo estimate @xmath61  @xcite . for the bridge exponent",
    "the prediction from the pre - existing exponent estimates is @xmath62    in this paper we will estimate critical exponents and amplitudes associated with bridges and taws via series and monte carlo methods .",
    "combining the two scaling relations , ( [ eq : scalinga ] ) and ( [ eq : scalingb ] ) , given in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , we obtain @xmath63 this exact relation suggests that the relationship between amplitudes corresponding to the lhs and rhs of the equation must be lattice independent , which in turn leads to a universal amplitude ratio .",
    "one interesting aspect of this ratio is that the objects involved are bridges and taws , which interact with a surface . loosely speaking , the scaling relation ( [ eq : scaling ] )",
    "may be interpreted as saying that the exponent associated with the number of pairs of taws of length @xmath0 ( which together have 2 free ends , and two ends anchored to a surface ) is the same as the exponent associated with the number of pairs made up of a saw and a bridge , each of length @xmath0 .    in order for the lattice specific effects to cancel",
    "it is crucial that the boundary condition where the walk terminates on the surface is the same for the taws and both ends of the bridges .",
    "now , the taws are anchored to the surface , and must satisfy the rule that the entire walk lies above this surface .",
    "in contrast , for convenience the bridges are defined to be asymmetric , with an additional step prepended to one end to lift it completely out of the surface at one end .",
    "thus we need modify the definition of a bridge to make it symmetric between its two ends . the most natural way to do this is to remove the trivial edge from the start of the bridge .",
    "conveniently , a straight - forward bijection exists between modified bridges of length @xmath0 which satisfy @xmath64 for any @xmath65 , and the usual bridges of length @xmath66 which satisfy @xmath67 for any @xmath68 .",
    "hence the number of modified bridges of length @xmath0 is just @xmath69 , and this is the coefficient that must be used in the definition of the amplitude ratio .    at the coefficient level ,",
    "the above considerations lead to the following sequence of ratios @xmath70 where the amplitudes @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are from ( [ eq : saw_asympt])([eq : t_asympt ] ) , and @xmath74 is a universal constant .",
    "that is to say , we expect this ratio @xmath74 to depend only on the spatial dimension of the lattice .    in terms of generating functions",
    ", the amplitude ratio is given as the limit @xmath75      we wish to highlight that the error estimates for the quantities calculated in this paper are not purely statistical , and hence there is a degree of subjectivity in obtaining them . in the analysis of relatively short series , which is the best that can be achieved for non - trivial 3d models such as saws , taws , and bridges , the interpretation of the results from series analysis can be quite subtle , and it is easy to be overly optimistic in interpreting the convergence ( or lack thereof ) of a sequence of improved estimates . for our monte carlo results we are approaching the large @xmath0 limit , and",
    "consequently there is a lesser ( but non - zero ) amount of subjectivity involved .",
    "we have included plots where relevant to allow readers to judge for themselves how reliable our confidence intervals are .",
    "loosely , one may think of the confidence intervals given in this paper as being roughly equivalent to a single standard deviation .      in sec .",
    "[ sec : series ] we describe the generation of the series data for simple cubic lattice taws and bridges , which is then analysed in the sec .  [ sec : seriesanalysis ] .",
    "thereafter we describe the monte carlo computer experiment in sec .",
    "[ sec : mcmethod ] , and analyse the resulting data in sec .",
    "[ sec : mcanalysis ] . finally , we discuss possible extensions and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we directly enumerated bridges and taws via a straight - forward optimized backtracking algorithm , whose running time was roughly proportional to the number of items being computed .    to enumerate taws up to a certain length a recursive function was used that took the set of sites currently visited , the coordinates of the current site , and the maximum number of bonds left . the function first adds one to the tally of taws of the current length .",
    "it then , assuming there is at least one bond left , chooses each unused adjacent site ( not allowing negative @xmath76 coordinates ) and calls the function again with that site as the current site , and one fewer sites remaining .",
    "this algorithm clearly has the function called exactly once for each taw enumerated .",
    "as each iteration of the recursive function contains a small amount of code , with only one loop over adjacent sites ( maximum 6 ) , its execution time is exactly proportional to the number of taws enumerated .",
    "enumerating bridges uses a very similar algorithm . in this case",
    "the recursive algorithm keeps track of an extra variable ; the maximum @xmath76 value reached ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "now instead of adding one to the taw tally on each function call , a check is performed to see if the @xmath76 coordinate of the current site equals @xmath77 .",
    "as described , this algorithm would have execution time proportional to the number of taws , as exactly the same function calls would be made as for the taws .",
    "the performance can be improved to be proportional to the ( significantly smaller ) number of bridges by pruning the search tree when the current taw can not ever result in a valid bridge .",
    "this can be prohibitively expensive to compute exactly ; a fast and very effective heuristic is to prune any branches when the @xmath76 coordinate of the current point plus the number of remaining bonds is less than @xmath77 .",
    "this is somewhat conservative ; it will not prune every dead branch as there might be an occupied site in the way ; however in practice it works very well resulting in a runtime basically proportional to the number of bridges .",
    "we can reduce the work required to determine @xmath12 by enumerating irreducible bridges instead , which are the set of bridges that can not be decomposed into a sequence of more than one bridge .",
    "irreducible bridges can also be characterised as the set of bridges which have at least 3 bonds between any two layers , other than the first layer , which must have precisely one bond .",
    "each bridge can in fact be uniquely decomposed into a non - empty sequence of irreducible bridges , and so the generating function for bridges , @xmath78 , may be expressed in terms of the generating function for irreducible bridges , @xmath79 , as @xmath80 using this relation one may obtain @xmath12 from the series for the less numerous irreducible bridges .",
    "enumerating irreducible bridges requires a slight modification to the bridges algorithm . in this case",
    "yet another variable @xmath81 is kept track of in the recursive function : @xmath81 is the largest @xmath76 value below which the taw is irreducible ( it has at least three bonds in the @xmath76 direction at each layer ) . to see",
    "if it is a valid irreducible bridge one now checks that the current @xmath76 value , @xmath77 , and @xmath81 are all equal .",
    "@xmath81 is easy to keep track of ; @xmath81 is incremented whenever a vertical step is made upwards from @xmath82 , as long as @xmath83 .",
    "as described , this algorithm would have the same execution time as the bridges algorithm .",
    "again , pruning can improve the speed to close to the significantly smaller number of irreducible bridges .",
    "the following conservative heuristic is used :    * if @xmath84 , prune if the number of remaining steps is less than @xmath85 ( this is the same as the bridges pruning ) ; * if @xmath86 , prune if the number of remaining steps is less than @xmath87 ( this is due to the need to go back down to @xmath82 , take one step sideways , and then return to @xmath88 ) .",
    "we find that his heuristic works very well in practice , and so the running time is roughly proportional to the number of irreducible bridges .",
    "there were a variety of other optimizations used to give constant improvements , such as assigning each conceivably reachable lattice point an integer index and pre - computing adjacencies so that points were represented by integers rather than a tuple of integers .",
    "symmetries were taken into account by enumerating all prefixes up to length roughly 8 ( it varied somewhat depending on what computer the enumeration was run on ) , canonicalizing them to account for symmetries , and assigning to equivalence classes .",
    "then the recursive algorithm described above was used on each equivalence class , and the results multiplied by the number of members of the equivalence class .",
    "the enumerations for each equivalence class were summed for the final result .",
    "it was then straight - forward to make the algorithm parallel ( to run on many different processors simultaneously ) .",
    "each equivalence class can be computed independently , and so were parcelled out to multiple processors , with the only interaction being the final summation .",
    "the algorithm as described above is in no way specific to three - dimensional systems , and indeed was made to also work in other dimensions .",
    "different lattice types could also be used , but this may affect the heuristics used for pruning dead branches of the search tree .",
    "the memory use is insignificant ; execution time is the constraint .",
    "as usual , we assume that the critical behaviour of taws is given by @xmath89 and that of bridges by @xmath90 here @xmath91 ( @xmath12 ) is the number of @xmath0-step taws ( bridges ) , counted up to translations .",
    "@xmath3 is the growth constant , for which we assume clisby s  @xcite estimate @xmath92 here @xmath93  @xcite is the leading correction - to - scaling exponent .",
    "@xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 are critical amplitudes ( n.b . , these are simply related to , but not the same as , the amplitudes for the series defined previously ) .    in analysing the data , we have of course assumed the existence of the various critical exponents ( which has not been proved ) , and have also used the best available estimate of the growth constant , given above , and the estimate of the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath98 there are a number of estimates in the literature for this exponent , obtained by a variety of methods , including field theoretical methods , series methods and monte carlo methods .",
    "estimates range from 0.47 up to 0.57 , with non - overlapping error bars .",
    "the recent monte carlo work of one of us  @xcite gives @xmath99 and it is this value that we will use in our monte carlo analysis .",
    "however our series work is less precise than the monte carlo work , and for that purpose taking @xmath100 is sufficiently precise .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : enumerations ] we give in table [ tab : one ] the series for taws up to length 26 , and for bridges up to length 28 .",
    "the bridge series is longer , as we actually counted the far less numerous irreducible bridges , and reconstructed the bridge generating function from the irreducible bridge generating function .",
    "we also recorded the heights of the irreducible bridges , and the full two - variable generating function for irreducible bridges , counting both length and height , is given in table [ tab : two ] in the appendix .",
    "the relationship between bridges and irreducible bridges is given in ( [ eq : irreducible ] ) .",
    "we first analysed both the taw and bridge series by using the standard method of differential approximants  @xcite .",
    "we initially attempted unbiased analyses of both the taw series and the bridge series .",
    "the results were disappointingly imprecise , despite choosing to use third order differential approximants , which should , in principle , be able to accommodate the expected confluent singularity structure .",
    "we had always intended to use biased differential approximants , as these are expected to give much more precise estimates of the exponents .",
    "but the disappointing lack of well - converged estimates in the unbiased case warns us not to be too hopeful of obtaining excellent results in the biased case . despite this",
    ", the estimates appeared tolerably well converged , and for taws we estimated @xmath101 while for bridges we estimated @xmath102 the estimate of @xmath52 just overlaps the earlier monte carlo estimate of grassberger @xcite , and also just overlaps our much more precise monte carlo estimate quoted below .",
    "we do not know why this estimate of @xmath52 is not more accurate .",
    "it is possible that the amplitude of the correction - to - scaling exponent is quite large , but we were unable to confirm this from the available data .",
    "the corresponding estimate of the bridge exponent @xmath56 is in excellent agreement with our monte carlo estimate , given below , though that estimate is again significantly more precise .",
    "we do not give more details or tables of data here , as in the next subsection we give a more precise analysis .    a completely different method of analysis",
    "was also tried .",
    "we first calculated the ratios of alternate coefficients , @xmath103 where we have used alternate coefficients to minimise the effect of the anti - ferromagnetic singularity located at @xmath104 then by standard ratio method techniques  @xcite , one expects the ratios to behave as @xmath105 here , for taws @xmath106 and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are constants , while for bridges @xmath109 using the estimate of @xmath3 given above , we can then estimate the exponent @xmath110 as the limit of the sequence @xmath111 defined by @xmath112    we used the inbuilt fitting function of maple to fit the elements of the sequence @xmath111 from @xmath113 to @xmath114 where @xmath115 to @xmath116 with @xmath117 varying from @xmath118 up to @xmath119 the estimates of @xmath111 were reasonably well converged , and in this way we estimated @xmath120 or @xmath121 a similar analysis for the bridge series was less well converged . fitting just to",
    "@xmath122 gave a decreasing sequence of estimates of @xmath123 while fitting to @xmath124 as done for taws gave an increasing sequence of estimates of @xmath125 averaging corresponding entries gave a fairly stable sequence , from which we estimated @xmath126 or @xmath127    combining our results from the two methods of analysis , we give as our series estimates from this data , @xmath128 and @xmath129 again , we do not give more details or tables of data here , as in the next subsection we give a more precise analysis .      the analysis discussed above",
    "is based on the exact series coefficients given in appendix  [ sec : enumerations ] .",
    "we can however obtain accurate approximations to the next five to seven terms of the series , which can then be used in our ratio analysis .",
    "because every differential approximant that uses all the available series coefficients implicitly predicts all subsequent coefficients , we realised that we could utilise this observation to calculate , approximately , all subsequent coefficients .",
    "of course the number of significant digits decreases as the number of predicted coefficients increases , but as we show below , we can get useful estimates of the next six or seven coefficients .    for every approximant using all the known coefficients",
    ", we generated the subsequent six or seven coefficients .",
    "we observe that the predicted coefficients agree to a certain number of significant digits among all the approximants , and we take these as our estimates .",
    "that is to say , assume we know the coefficients @xmath130 for @xmath131.$ ] we then predict the coefficients @xmath132 our estimate of each such coefficient is given by the average of the values predicted by the differential approximants .",
    "we reject obvious outliers , which are infrequent , and quote only those digits for which all approximants agree .",
    "so for example if the first 8 digits agree , and the coefficient is predicted to be a 20 digit integer , we will quote the coefficient as the 8 predicted digits followed by 12 zeros .",
    "not surprisingly , we find the greatest number of digits are predicted for @xmath133 with the number of digits slowly decreasing as we generated further coefficients .    these predicted",
    "coefficients are not suitable for including in our differential approximant analysis , as they were derived from lower order differential approximants .",
    "however for ratio type analyses they are very well suited , as discrepancies in say the seventh or eighth significant digits will not affect the ratio analysis in the slightest .",
    "this is particularly useful in those situations where we suspect there might be a turning point in the behaviour of ratios or their extrapolants with our exact coefficients , as these approximate coefficients are more than accurate enough to reveal such behaviour , if it is present .    as a demonstration of this method ,",
    "assume we only have 23 terms in the bridge generating function , and we ll predict the next 6 coefficients . in table [ tab : bridge - pred ] we show the predicted and exact coefficients .",
