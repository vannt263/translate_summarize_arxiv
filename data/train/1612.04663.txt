    "among the various sources of energy , oil remains as one of the most valuable ones , considering its extensive use in the daily life , such as in the production of gasoline , plastic , etc . after discovering a petroleum reservoir",
    ", one can extract about 15 - 50% of the oil by using and maintaining the initial pressure in the reservoir through water flooding ( first and second phase oil recovery ) ; however , 50 - 85% of oil remains in the reservoir after this , so called conventional recovery @xcite .",
    "this is the motivation for developing new extraction techniques in order to recover the most oil possible .",
    "one of these eor techniques consists of adding bacteria to the reservoirs and using their bioproducts and effects to improve the oil production , which is called meor .",
    "besides all meor experiments @xcite , it is worth pointing out that meor has been already used successfully in oil reservoirs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the meor technology is not yet completely understood and there is a strong need for reliable mathematical models and numerical tools to be used for optimizing meor .",
    "the bioproducts formed due to microbial activity are acids , biomass , gases , polymers , solvents and surfactants @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of using microbes ( bacteria ) is to modify the fluid and rock properties in order to enhance the oil recovery .",
    "these microbes and the produced surfactants have the advantage to be biodegradable , temperature tolerant , ph - hardy , non - harmful to humans and lower concentrations of them can produce similar results as chemical surfactants @xcite .",
    "we can describe briefly the model presented as follows : we inject water , bacteria and nutrients to a reservoir .",
    "the bacteria consume nutrients and produce more bacteria and surfactants . as time passes , some bacteria die or reproduce .",
    "the surfactants reduce the oil - water ift , allowing the recovery of more oil .",
    "the consideration of ifa in the model allows to include the biological production of surfactants at the oil - water interface @xcite , reduces the hysteresis @xcite and also enables to include that bacteria is mainly living at the oil - water interface @xcite , which is believed to be a very important feature for meor .",
    "there exist different systems where the ifa is important .",
    "for example , another important application of microorganisms is in the soil remediation @xcite .",
    "specially , surfactants can increase bioavailability and degradation of soil contaminants , for example petroleum - derived hydrocarbons @xcite . nevertheless , although the general theory for ifa was established @xcite , the development of ifa based models for particular applications remains a current challenge . in this work",
    "we will derive for the first time a mathematical model for meor which includes ifa .",
    "it is worth to be mentioned that further developments of the present model , which are considering a formal upscaling from pore to core and in this way better describe the evolution of the micro scale are possible but beyond the aim of this study @xcite .",
    "mathematical models for meor are based on coupled nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) and ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , which are very difficult to be solved .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to use advanced numerical methods and simulations to predict the behavior on time of the unknowns in this complex system .",
    "for example , in @xcite they used a semi - implicit finite difference technique and in @xcite they used comsol multiphysics , that is a commercial pde solver using finite elements together with variable - step back differentiation and newton method . even though it is possible to buy commercial software in the petroleum industry for simulation",
    ", it is preferable to do the discretization of the equations and write an own code to perform numerical simulations , in order to implement new relations that are not included in the commercial ones .",
    "most of the meor models are based on non - realistic simplifications ( for example , only one transport equation for the bacteria is considered , hysteresis in the capillary pressure is neglected , the oil - water interfacial area is not included , numerical simulations are just made in 1d @xcite ) . in this general context ,",
    "the objective of the research reported in the present article was to develop and implement ( in a 2d porous media ) an accurate numerical simulator for meor .    to summarize , the new contributions of this paper are    * the development of a multidimensional comprehensive mathematical model for + meor , which includes bacteria , nutrients , surfactants and two - phase flow . * the inclusion of the role of ifa in meor .",
    "* the inclusion of the tendency of bacteria to move to the oil - water interface . * the inclusion of the biological production of surfactants at the oil - water interface .",
    "the paper is structured as follows    * reservoir modeling .",
    "we introduce the basic concepts , ideas and equations for modeling meor .",
    "in addition , we explain the new phenomena we can model in meor when we include the ifa .",
    "* discretization and implementation .",
    "we explain the techniques we used for the discretization , namely finite differences and tpfa for the spatial discretization and backward euler ( be ) for the time discretization .",
    "we also describe the algorithm we used for numerically solving the mathematical model for meor . * results and discussion .",
    "we present the results of the numerical experiments by studying the effects of the new relations we proposed for modeling meor .",
    "* conclusion and future work .",
    "let us consider a porous medium filled with water and oil .",
    "we assume that the fluids are immiscible and incompressible . for knowing the amount of a phase in the representative element volume ( rev )",
    ", we introduce the saturation of phase @xmath1 ( for oil @xmath2 and for water @xmath3 ) given by the ratio of volume of phase @xmath1 ( in rev ) over the volume of voids ( in rev ) . in the case where the porous medium is just filled with two fluids",
    ", we have that @xmath4 .    in the oil - water interface",
    "there is a surface free energy due to natural electrical forces , which attract the molecules to the interior of each phase and to the contact surface @xcite .",
    "the ift keeps the fluids separated and it is defined by the quantity of work needed to separate a surface of unit area from both fluids .    capillary pressure @xmath5 is the difference in pressure between two immiscible phases of fluids occupying similar pores due to ift between the phases @xcite .",
    "it is known that @xmath5 is not a well - defined function because to one value of water saturation , corresponds more than one value of @xmath5 , due to @xmath5 being dependent on the history .",
    "it means that different saturation values are expected during imbibition as in drainage .",
    "this phenomenon occurring in many porous media systems is called hysteresis .",
    "we write darcy s law and the mass conservation equations for each @xmath1 phase ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the porosity , @xmath9 the volumetric flow rate per area , @xmath10 the source / sink term , @xmath11 the density , @xmath12 the absolute permeability and @xmath13 the phase mobility , with @xmath14 the relative permeability and @xmath15 the viscosity . in this work",
    "we consider that the porosity does not change over time .",
    "defining the average pressure @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , using @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we can reformulate the problem solving for @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 an extended description of the previous equations can be found e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .      considering a porous medium filled with two fluids , the surface where they make contact",
    "is called ifa .",
    "mathematically , we compute the specific ifa @xmath24 as a ratio of the ifa in the rev over the volume of rev . for understanding better the importance of @xmath24 in the oil recovery ,",
    "let us consider fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we observe that splitting the square in four pieces , the ifa increases by a factor of 2 .",
    "then , we can recover faster the oil in the zones with larger ifa .        when darcy made his experiments and deduced his law , he just considered a single - phase flow . in the case of two - phase flow , we just extend darcy s law for two fluids , but we may expect there are more forces involve than the gradient of the hydraulic head . in @xcite",
    "was developed equations of momentum balance for phases and interfaces , based on thermodynamic principles .",
    "in addition , equations of balance of mass for phases and interfaces are considered @xcite . after performing various transformations @xcite , the following balance equation of specific interfacial area for the oil - water interface is obtained @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the interfacial velocity , @xmath27 is the rate of production / destruction of specific ifa and @xmath28 is the interfacial permeability .",
    "based on a thermodynamic approach , @xcite demonstrated that including the ifa in the capillary pressure relation reduces the hysteresis under equilibrium conditions .    in order to close our model , which includes the specific oil - water ifa",
    ", we have to provide a relation @xmath29 that accounts for interfacial forces .",
    "this relation can be obtained by fitting surfaces to @xmath30 data coming from models or experiments . in @xcite",
    ", they used a bi - quadratic relationship .",
    "however , this relation does not fulfill the requirements @xmath31 . in this work",
    ", we use the next relation @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 constants . from the previous parameterization",
    ", we can isolate the capillary pressure @xmath37 for solving the specific ifa equation , we need to provide the mathematical expression for @xmath27 . in @xcite",
    "was proposed the following relation based on physical arguments @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a parameter characterizing the strength of change of specific ifa due to a change of saturation @xmath40    the path @xmath41 is in general unknown , but in the main drainage and imbibition curves , @xmath5 is a known function of @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , it is possible to compute this derivative for @xmath42 .",
    "for all other paths , we interpolate using these three values of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations focused on simultaneously measuring @xmath5 , @xmath22 and @xmath24 are often difficult , expensive and subject to limitations , thus only a few have been reported in the literature , indicating a need for further experimental studies characterizing the relationship @xmath43 @xcite .      for describing the movement of bacteria , nutrients and surfactants , we consider the following transport equations ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 where the reaction rate terms are given by @xcite @xmath46 and in the general case",
    "the dispersion coefficients are given by @xmath47 where the fluid velocity of the aqueous phase is given by @xmath48 .",
    "in the previous equations , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the concentrations of bacteria , nutrients and surfactants , @xmath52 the longitudinal dispersivity , @xmath53 the transverse dispersivity , @xmath54 the effective diffusion coefficients of bacteria , nutrients and surfactants in the water phase and @xmath55 the dirac delta .",
    "we consider that the bacteria , nutrients and surfactants live on the water , so their transport due to the convection is given by the term @xmath56 .",
    "we include gravity effects on the bacteria considering the settling velocity of bacteria @xmath57 . for including that the bacteria has a tendency to live in the oil - water interface @xcite , we add the chemotactic velocity @xmath58 in the bacteria transport equation .",
    "we propose the following expression for the chemotactic velocity @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a diffusive term .",
    "it is for the first time when such a chemotaxis term is included in the modeling transport of bacteria in two - phase porous media . including the chemotaxis in meor models is important because besides the external constrains , it also determines the distribution of bacteria in the soil @xcite .",
    "let us analyses the reaction terms for the transport equations . for modeling the growth of bacteria",
    ", we use the monod - type model @xcite @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the observed maximum growth rate and @xmath63 the half saturation constant , being the nutrient concentration level when @xmath64 . on the other hand",

    "we introduce the surfactant yield coefficients @xmath66 .",
    "for the nutrients consumed for bacteria , we consider the yield coefficient @xmath67 , which we included in the @xmath68 term . in the absence of ifa , one relation for the production rate of surfactants is given by @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the maximum specific biomass production rate , and @xmath71 the critical nutrient concentration for metabolism term , that models a need of minimum @xmath50 for obtaining surfactants .",
    "one of the characteristics that a surfactant should have is biological production at the oil - water interface @xcite . in order to consider this effect in our model",
    ", we consider the production rate of surfactant as a function of the nutrient concentration and ifa . to our knowledge",
    ", there are not experimental studies to deduce a mathematical relation of the surfactant production in function of the ifa ; therefore , we need experiments for @xmath72 . given the mathematical characteristics of the monod - type function , we propose the following expression for the production rate of surfactants @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the half saturation constant .",
    "the pressure , saturation and ifa equations are coupled with these transport equations under the assumptions that the two - phase flows are incompressible and immiscible , both viscosities are constants , the presence of dissolved salt in the wetting phase is neglected and the system is isothermal @xcite .",
    "one of the main objectives of applying meor is to reduce the @xmath75 via surfactant effect on the oil - water ift .",
    "there exist several experiments showing the impact of surfactants in reducing the ift @xcite .",
    "common initial ift values are of the order of @xmath76 mn / m and we aim to lower this value @xmath77 mn / m @xcite",
    ". one mathematical model for the ift reduction is given by @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the initial ift , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are fitting parameters , which define the efficiency of the surfactant , moderating the concentration where the ift drops dramatically and the minimal ift achieved after the surfactant action @xcite .",
