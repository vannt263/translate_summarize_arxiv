    "the gamma - ray binary system psr  b1259 - 63/ls  2883  consists of a 48  ms pulsar orbiting around a be star .",
    "the orbit is eccentric ( @xmath0 ) with an orbital period of @xmath1  yr @xcite .",
    "the system is particularly interesting because it is the only gamma - ray binary system where the nature of the compact object is known .",
    "unpulsed tev gamma - ray emission has previously been detected around periastron by the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . )",
    "previous observations have also detected unpulsed radio emission near periastron ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) and x - ray emission across the whole orbit ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the discovery of extended radio and x - ray structures have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "these observations have shown that the unpulsed emission is variable at all wavelengths with respect to the orbital period .",
    "the system was observed around the 2010 periastron passage ( @xmath2 14 december 2010 ) with _",
    "fermi_/lat in the high energy ( he , @xmath3  gev ) regime and showed a flux modulation during the periastron passage , peaking @xmath4  days after periastron @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal radiation from the system is powered by the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar and the unpulsed radiation originates from the stand - off shock front which forms between the pulsar and stellar wind .",
    "extensive modelling of this process has been presented in @xcite , where the x - rays are produced via synchrotron radiation of ultra - relativistic electrons ( lorentz factor @xmath5 ) and gamma - rays through the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of target photons from the be star .",
    "the ratio between the x - ray and gamma - ray flux is dependent on the radiative and adiabatic cooling times of the post - shocked pulsar wind .",
    "ic cooling was predicted to increase near periastron .",
    "ic cooling of the pre - shocked pulsar wind was also suggested for psr  b1259 - 63  by @xcite .",
    "the optical companion in the system , ls  2883 , is a be star , and produces an infrared ( ir ) flux which is higher than predicted by kurucz stellar atmosphere models @xcite .",
    "this ir excess is produced by free - free and free - bound emission in the circumstellar disc which surrounds the be star .",
    "these be star circumstellar discs are decretion discs which form around be stars and are regions of enhanced stellar outflow .",
    "optical interferometry observations of these extended circumstellar envelopes have shown that they are symmetrical around the rotation axis ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the decretion discs are variable and grow and shrink over periods of hundreds to thousands of days . see e.g.  @xcite for a review of classical be stars .",
    "the ir excess from the circumstellar disc provides an additional photon source to the blackbody flux from the optical star .",
    "@xcite showed that in the isotropic case this ir excess could increase the gamma - ray flux , particularly at gev energies , by a factor @xmath6 .",
    "it is possible that near the disc crossing the ir excess may have a much greater effect . in this study",
    "we discuss the effects of the ir excess near periastron , adopting an anisotropic inverse compton model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the soft photon excess provides target photons for ic scattering in the thomson limit where the scattering cross section is a maximum .",
    "the additional effects of the different electron cooling processes in the plerion shock front ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the effects of gamma - ray absorption @xcite , will not be discussed in this paper and the reader is directed to the given reference for relevant discussions . in order to include the ir excess",
    ", we determine the target photon distribution using a modified version of the curve of growth method which was first proposed by @xcite ( referred to hereafter as the cog method ) .",
    "this modified cog model takes into account the changing optical depth as seen by the pulsar during its orbit .",
    "we constrain the cog model using literature data and vlt observations which were taken during january 2011 , approximately 22  days after the december 2010 periastron passage .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : an outline of previous observations and modelling of psr  b1259 - 63  is presented in section  [ psrb ] ; section  [ sec : observations ] discusses observations we obtained with the vlt , salt , saao  1.9 m   and irsf  telescopes after the 2010 periastron passage ; section  [ be - stars ] discusses the modified cog method that we have derived ; the anisotropic ic scattering is discussed in section  [ ic ] ; section  [ sec : modelling ] outlines our modelling of the anisotropic inverse compton scattering around periastron ; sections  [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] discuss the results and implications thereof .",
    "a few optical and ir photometric observations of ls  2883 are reported in literature and available in bright star catalogues .",
    "a comparison of the catalogues observations show little change in the optical magnitude . @xcite",
    "confined the spectral range of ls  2883 to a o9 - b2 type star with a colour excess of @xmath7 and assumed a spectral type b2e , with @xmath8  m@xmath9 and @xmath10  r@xmath11 .",
    "analysis of spectroscopic observations also showed that h@xmath12 emission occurred at a radius of @xmath13 , assuming a keplerian circumstellar disc , which implies that the circumstellar disc has a radius @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite undertook spectroscopic observations of ls  2883 and proposed new system parameters .",

    "observations of the system during consecutive periastron passages show that the pulsed radio signal is eclipsed between roughly 20 days before periastron until 20 days after .",
    "this is believed to be the result of the pulsar passing behind the be star s circumstellar disc .",
    "the binary separation at @xmath17 days is @xmath18 ( assuming @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) which implies that the disc radius is @xmath21 .",
    "for this reason we have adopted a disc radius of @xmath22 in this study .",
    "it should be noted , however , that smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the circumstellar disc might be `` blown - away '' by the pulsar wind if the base density of the disc is low .",

    "this results in a slight decrease in the influence of the circumstellar disc in the anisotropic calculation .",
    "the increase in the aic spectrum is of the same order as the isotropic approximation because the ir excess predicted in this paper is higher than considered in @xcite .",

    "this implies that the ir excess is higher than previously considered .",
    "the disc is therefore brighter because of a higher disc temperature and is brighter relative to the star .",
    "this relative increase in the photon spectrum increases the influence of the disc photon contribution .      the predicted aic , gamma - ray light curves ( figs .  [",
    "fig : aic_light_curve_fermi_new ] , [ fig : aic_light_curve_hess_new ] & [ fig : fermi_multiplot_preshock ] ) show that the disc contribution exhibits three properties : firstly , the contribution is a maximum around periastron ; secondly , there is a slight increase just before the disc crossing epoch and a minimum at the disc crossing ; and lastly , the rise after the disc crossing is much faster than the slow rise just before the disc crossing .",
    "this modelled disc contribution light curve is a combination of the photon distribution of the circumstellar disc and the ic scattering angle , as discussed below .    as shown by the profile of the normalized photon number density originating from the disc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disc_ir_profile ] ) , higher frequency photons occur mainly near the centre of the circumstellar disc while longer wavelengths remain constant further out in the disc .",

    "the photon density is much lower .",
    "while the target photons from the disc originate from a wide solid angle near the disc crossing epoch , the bright central region only extends over a small solid angle at large polar angles .",
    "near periastron the pulsar is closer to the star and the bright region of the disc , providing a larger solid angle of brighter photons for ic scattering .",

    "the scattering from the disc increases rapidly after the disc crossing epoch due to more favourable scattering angles . due to the system orientation ,",
    "before the disc crossing , all scatterings occur predominantly head - to - tail ( @xmath54 ) while after the disc crossing predominantly head - to - head ( @xmath55 ) collisions occur . on the other hand , the aic scattering of the stellar photons follows a smooth transition which results in a smooth light curve and not the sharp increase and decrease seen for the disc contribution .",

    "these observations then suggest that the shock heating which should occur during the pulsar - disc crossing will be more localised around the pulsar .",
    "@xcite discussed thermal x - ray emission in gamma - ray binaries as a result of the shock heating of the stellar wind .",
    "these authors estimated the total luminosity of the thermal x - rays as some fraction of the total kinetic luminosity of the stellar wind .",
    "we can make a similar approximation of the total amount of energy available for optical / ir emission from shock heating by estimating the kinetic luminosity of the stellar wind from ls  2883 .",
    "the total kinetic luminosity can be approximated by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the mass loss rate , and @xmath65 is the speed of the wind .",
    "similarly to @xcite we can estimate the kinetic luminosity for the polar wind to be , @xmath66 and for the equatorial wind to be @xmath67 the kinetic luminosity of the circumstellar disc can also be estimated by considering the disc to be keplerian , with a velocity @xmath68 .",
    "if the density through the circumstellar disc is given by equation  [ eqn : rho_distance ] , the mass flow rate of the disc through an area d@xmath69 is given by @xmath70 , where the density and velocity depend on the distance @xmath71 from the centre of the star .",
    "integrating over the area of the disc perpendicular to the direction of the disc motion ( d@xmath72 ) gives the total kinetic luminosity as @xmath73 here @xmath74 has been calculated from equation  [ eqn : rho_distance ] and the fitted cog parameters have been used . since",
    "only a fraction of the available kinetic luminosity can be directed into shock heating , it seems likely that any increase in the ir / optical emission will have a luminosity @xmath75  erg  s@xmath27 .",
    "it has also been shown by @xcite that doppler boosting of the synchrotron emission could produce the required energy level to explain the _",
    "fermi_/lat flare .",
    "the resulting flare occurs because of the preferential direction of the shock outflow after the second disc crossing which results in bulk doppler boosting of material in the cone of the pulsar wind shock front .",
    "this suggests that the _ fermi_/lat flare is the result of the combined effects of shock heating and doppler shifting .",
    "the sph simulations undertaken by @xcite show that circumstellar disc can be deformed around the pulsar , creating a cavity - like structure around the pulsar .",
    "such a shock heated cavity may then allow for additional photons , which will allow for head - to - head gamma - ray production after the second disc crossing .    dedicated optical and ir campaigns around future disc crossing phases are required to investigate the degree to which the circumstellar disc is influenced by the pulsar and pulsar wind .",
    "the binary star system psr  b1259 - 63/ls  2883  has remained a fascinating source since the detection of the pulsar approximately two decades ago .",
    "the interaction between the be star and the pulsar produces multi - wavelength emission from radio up to tev gamma - rays , covering 19 decades in energy .",
    "the optical companion in the system is a be type star , known to possess a circumstellar disc which produces an ir flux .",
    "this flux is observed as an ir excess which is higher than predicted by blackbody and stellar atmosphere models .",
    "since the gamma - rays in the system are produced by the up - scattering of photons , the presence of an extended and additional photon source could potentially have a significant effect on the gamma - ray production in psr  b1259 - 63/ls  2883 .",
    "we modified the cog method , first proposed by @xcite , which allowed us to predict the flux originating from the circumstellar disc at any position near the disc .",
    "this method has been used to predict the photon density as observed from the point - of - view of the pulsar .",
    "the cog method was constrained using optical and ir data obtained from literature and vlt observations .",
    "the photon density was calculated around periastron and we applied it to the problem of aic scattering .",
    "the anisotropic scattering considered the change in the photon distribution during the orbit , the variation in the solid angle subtending the disc , and the direction of scattering .",
    "the variation in the gamma - ray spectrum around periastron was calculated for different disc orientations .",
    "in this study the leptons in the pulsar wind are assumed to be mono - energetic before the stand - off shock and a power - law energy distribution in the post - shock region .",
    "both a pre and post  shock distribution have been considered . for psr",
    "b1259 - 63 , it can be shown that adiabatic cooling dominates near the stand - off shock and , for this reason , only adiabatic cooling was considered for the aic modelling .",
    "the ic modelling showed that the inclusion of the ir excess associated with the circumstellar disc increased the gev gamma - rays by a factor @xmath76 .",
    "this relative increase in the flux is partly dependent on the choice of the electron distribution . for a wide distribution",
    "( e.g.  @xmath77 ) , as was shown for the isotropic modelling ( fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or an electron distribution centred around @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_multiplot_preshock ] ) , the ic scattering is dominated by the scattering of stellar photons in the thomson limit . however , this study has shown that for the electron distribution proposed by @xcite , which has been shown to provide a reasonable fit to the 2004 h.e.s.s .",
    "observations , the ir excess from the circumstellar disc increases the gamma - ray flux by a factor @xmath79 at gev energies .    the predicted light curves show ( figs .",
    "[ fig : aic_light_curve_fermi_new ] , [ fig : aic_light_curve_hess_new ] & [ fig : fermi_multiplot_preshock ] ) that the circumstellar disc is most influential close to periastron and , generally , after the disc crossing .",
    "this is a result of the disc being brightest near the stellar surface and the associated favourable scattering angles after the disc crossing .",
    "while it was thought the predicted gamma - ray flux may be highest near the disc crossing epoch ( @xmath80  days ) , the low intensity of the disc at @xmath40 stellar radii from the star s surface does not provide a sufficient number of photons to increase significantly the gamma - ray flux in this region .",
    "this study has only considered a steady state disc and has not considered what effects the pulsar passage may have introduced on the circumstellar disc .",
    "shock heating of the disc or clumping of material may result in regions of higher intensity which could result in more localised flux increases .",
    "the additional effects such as changes in the electron cooling have not been considered , as these have been addressed by other authors .",
    "this study has focussed on the effect of the ir excess from the circumstellar disc in order to determine its influence on the production of gev energy gamma - rays .",
    "the study shows that the gamma - ray flux could be increased by a factor greater than two at gev energies , which is a significant increase .",
    "however , the predicted gamma - ray flux lies far below that detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat at the previous periastron passage . a combination of a number of effects , including e.g.  doppler boosting , shock heating and changes in the shock front are required to explain the flare that was observed by _",
