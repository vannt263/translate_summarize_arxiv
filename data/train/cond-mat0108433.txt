    "a combinatorial optimization problem is defined , in a broad sense , by specifying a certain number of free variables constituting it and the conditions that its solution must satisfy . in treating an optimization problem",
    "the fundamental step is to find the _ most efficient _ algorithm yielding the solution .",
    "efficient from the point of view of all the computing resources needed for its performance , the most important of which is the time requirement , and , in particular , its dependence on the _ size _ of the problem . by size we mean , in an informal way , the number of variables , or , even , the number of conditions .    a computational hard problem @xcite is an optimization problem for which the time needed to find the solution , or to determine with certainty that it has no solution , very sensitively increases with the size . more specifically there are no polynomial algorithms able to solve it .",
    "this kind of problems are therefore called _ intractable _ or non polynomial ( np ) .",
    "any np problem can be reduced to a particular np paradigmatic problem ( the sat problem ) exploiting algorithms performing such a mapping in a polynomial time @xcite .",
    "computer scientists call this class of very hard combinatorial optimization problems the class of non polynomial - complete ( npc ) problems @xcite .    summing - up , a npc problem is defined , in a qualitative way , as an optimization problem whose solutions , or the certainty that it has no solution , can only be found , in the worst case , by algorithms whose computation time grows faster than any polynomial with the number of variables of the system",
    ".    in this paper we shall consider the 3-sat problem @xcite .",
    "this is a particular version of sat problem , which is the paradigm of npc combinatorial problems showing a phase transition . for this problem",
    "the free variables are boolean variables and the conditions are sets of three boolean numbers .",
    "its importance , apart from being a historical one , comes from the fact that even if theoretically any npc problem can be mapped in any other , in practice given problems are better suited for proving such correspondence . of these reference problems",
    "one of the most useful ( and used ) is the 3-sat .    in the last years a one to one correspondence",
    "has been observed between computational hard problems and the ground state properties of spin - glass models @xcite .",
    "statistical mechanics has been applied to the study of universal behaviour in the computational cost of some class of algorithms , searching for solutions of random realizations of the prototype of the npc problems : the satisfaction ( sat ) problem @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the properties of npc problems is then performed through the introduction of an energy or cost function and an artificial temperature . in this mapping",
    "the actual npc problem is recovered as the @xmath3 limit of the associated statistical mechanical problem .",
    "such an approach has been implemented both numerically , using simulated annealing algorithms @xcite ) , and analytically .    to set up a statistical mechanical approach",
    "one first introduces a semidefinite positive hamiltonian @xmath4 $ ] function , defined for each given instance @xmath5 of the problem , constructed in such a way that if the configuration @xmath6 is solution of the computational problem then @xmath7=0 $ ] . on the contrary , if @xmath4>0 $ ] for any @xmath5 then problem does not admit solution .",
    "having defined an hamiltonian , the associated statistical mechanical problem is described by the partition function @xmath8 ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the ( artificial ) temperature of the system .",
    "proceeding further one introduces the usual thermodynamic quantities , e.g. , the energy @xmath10 the mapping is not trivial since intensive quantities , such as the energy density @xmath11 , do not depend on @xmath12 in the infinite @xmath12 limit , so that a computation of their average over the distribution of instances of the computational problem is sufficient to obtain relevant informations on its satisfiability .    eventually , to recover the original computational problem , the limit @xmath13 has to be taken .",
    "we stress that , in this approach , the temperature only plays a role for the constsruction of a statistical mechanics problem , of which the only interesting features are those at @xmath3 .    in this approach ,",
    "phase transition concepts play an important role to build a theory for typical case complexity in theoretical computational science .",
    "the importance comes from the fact that npc decision problems , that are computationally hard in the worst case , may be not in the typical case , if one excludes the critical regions of the parameter space , where almost all instances become computationally hard to solve .",
    "the computational critical region corresponds to a phase transition region in statistical mechanics language .",
    "far from phase boundaries the problems are either under - constrained or over - constrained and one can determine search procedures able to find solutions , or certainty of no solution , in polynomial times : the results of worst - case complexity theory are not very relevant in practice and what is necessary is a theory for typical - case complexity .",
    "to such a purpose , the analysis of general search methods applied to different classes of hard computational problems , characterized by a large number or relevant , randomly generated , variables , is fundamental .",
    "variables are under - constrained when the minimal number of violated clauses does not depend on their possible assignments . in particular this",
    "is true when they do not appear in any clause . in the under - constrained phase the clauses of the problem",
    "can always be satisfied ( sat phase ) .",
    "on the contrary , variables are over - constrained when they can not satisfy simultaneously all the clauses imposed on them . in this case",
    "we are in the unsat phase .",
    "going back to the mapping onto a statistical mechanical problem , the unsat - phase corresponds to a frozen ( spin - glass ) phase while the sat - phase corresponds to an ordered ( ferromagnetic ) phase .    the 3-sat problem , and , in general , the @xmath14-sat problem where the clauses contain a number @xmath14 of elements , can be mapped onto a diluted long - range spin - glass model @xcite .",
    "the model is mean - field because of the lack of geometrical correlations in the clauses .",
    "however , since each spin has only a finite number of neighbours strong local field fluctuations , stronger than in those of fully connected spin - glass , are present .    the relevant parameter driving the sat / unsat transition is the ratio @xmath15 between clauses and number of variables of the system , which is the connectivity in the statistical mechanical analogue of the combinatorial problem .",
    "indeed too many conditions cause the unsatisfiability of the problem .",
    "the entropy of the associated spin model gives a measure of the typical number of solutions .",
    "therefore at the transition an abrupt disappearance of all ( exponentially numerous ) solutions makes the entropy jump to zero .    for @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "the problem is solvable : the time to find the solutions grows polynomially ( actually even linearly @xcite ) with the number of variables .",
    "for @xmath18 the problem is , on the contrary , npc .",
    "the transition threshold for 3-sat has been determined numerically at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "based on the mapping of random clauses onto the quenched disorder of the associated spin model , in ref .",
    "@xcite the replica trick was introduced to compute the statistical mechanics of the k - sat problem and the replica symmetric ( rs ) theory was carried out .",
    "the k - sat problem is naturally mapped onto a disordered spin model with finite connectivity , where the role of connectivity is played by the density of clauses . even if it gives a qualitative good pattern of the transition it is , however , unable to predict correctly the value of the transition threshold between the sat - phase and the unsat - phase and the correct thermodynamic quantities in the unsat - phase .",
    "the failure of the rs solution can be traced back to the existence of a very large number of equilibrium states of the associated statistical mechanical problem in the thermodynamic limit @xmath20 . to deal with those , and improve the knowledge of the structure of the solutions of the decision problem , it is necessary to break the replica symmetry .",
    "replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) in diluted models is a very hard issue , due to the complex structure of the saddle point equations , for recent approaches see @xcite .    as shown in @xcite the sat / unsat transition results from the sudden freezing of a finite number of variables , as @xmath15 increases above @xmath21 .",
    "these variables form a _",
    "backbone _ that does not disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "information about the structure of this backbone and about the mutual overlap between different assignments minimizing the cost function in the unsat phase is , then , very important to understand the transition .    in an attempt to overcome the difficulty of solving a spin glass diluted model a variational approach , both for rs and @xmath22-rsb solution , has been recently proposed .",
    "it is based on the existence of the backbone of over - constrained variable that remains finite in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this circumvent the necessity of solving the self - consistent equations for rs and @xmath22-rsb , but does not resolve the question about the nature of the rsb solution in the unsat - phase .",
    "thus the relation between rsb transition and the typical case complexity theory is yet an open question .    in order to investigate the the nature of the rsb solution in the unsat - phase , in this paper we shall consider the k - sat problem with @xmath23 , the simplest npc problem of this class , in the limit of a large number of clauses @xmath24 ( over - constrained ) , where the associated statistical mechanical problem can be handled with known techniques of disordered spin systems .",
    "the basic idea is that since there should be no other transitions for @xmath25 , the structure of the unsat - phase for @xmath26 should be representative of the whole unsat - phase in the range @xmath25 . performing a careful study of the thermodynamic quantities down to zero temperature of the associated disordered spin model we find that the rsb is infinitely broken ( @xmath2-rsb ) in the unsat - phase",
    "moreover , using the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion in @xmath27 of the thermodynamic quantities , we can obtain an upper bound for @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secmod ]",
    "we introduce the model .",
    "the details of the derivation of the @xmath2-rsb solution with an arbitrary gauge are given in section [ secirsb ] .",
    "the calculation is carried out for a general model introduced in section [ secr ] , to which the over - constrained @xmath0-sat problem belongs .",
    "here we also sketch the procedure used for the numerical of solution of the @xmath2-rsb solution .",
    "the @xmath2-rsb solution for the over - constrained @xmath0-sat model is discussed in sections [ irsb ] and [ td ] .",
    "the model we study has been introduced in @xcite , where the analysis of rsb at one and two steps has been carried out .",
    "the @xmath0-sat model is defined by a set of boolean variables @xmath28 , defined on the sites @xmath29 , and an ensemble of randomly generated @xmath0-sat boolean formulae .",
    "first the random boolean formulae are constructed by assign to each triplet @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , a set of three independent variables @xmath32 which take the value @xmath33 or @xmath34 with probability @xmath35 .",
    "next for each instance of the problem triplets of randomly chosen sites @xmath30 are selected by assigning to the variables @xmath36 the value @xmath22 with probability @xmath37 and @xmath38 with probability @xmath39 . for",
    "@xmath40 there are @xmath41 variables @xmath42 which are different from zero , and hence @xmath41 @xmath0-sat boolean formulae ..    if we introduce the spin variables @xmath43 , the cost function reads @xmath44 which is nothing but the number of unsatisfied clauses .",
    "indeed it is easy to see that each term is either @xmath22 ( unsatisfied ) or @xmath38 ( satisfied ) .",
    "note that @xmath45 if and only if all the clauses are satisfied .",
    "the statistical mechanical approach to the @xmath0-sat problem takes @xmath46 as the hamiltonian of a disordered spin system , and , as discussed above , studies the properties of the ground state .",
    "the fundamental quantities in studying the hard optimization problems with the tools of statistical mechanics are the zero temperature energy and entropy densities , respectively @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "@xmath47 represents the average over the distribution of clauses of the number of clauses that are not satisfied by the formula ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "@xmath48 is the logarithm of the number of solutions satisfying the formula divided by the number of variables . for the behaviour of these quantities as functions of the connectivity - like parameter @xmath15 , the conjecture is done@xcite that @xmath49    for @xmath50 the problem is quite under - constrained and it is relatively easy to find an assignment of variables @xmath51 satisfying the clauses .",
    "in other words for @xmath52 the problem is sat , with probability going to 1 for @xmath20 , on the contrary for @xmath25 the problem does not have solutions , unsat - phase .",
    "the analysis of the unsat - phase is in general rather hard .",
    "the most difficult case occurs around @xmath21 where an exponential time may be needed to determine the unsatisfiability .",
    "away from the critical region , i.e. , @xmath53 , to prove unsatisfiability is easier , and more insight into the structure of the phase space can be gained .    in the present paper",
    "we will work in the over - constrained approximation @xmath54 , where the computation strongly simplifies .",
    "this limit is obtained by expanding in @xmath27 to second order , after having rescaled the temperature @xmath55 . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the reduced inverse temperature was @xmath56 . here",
    "we will , instead , keep the notation @xmath57 also for the reduced inverse temperature .",
    "moreover in @xcite the clauses are erroneously over counted in the evaluation of the partition function @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not produce any relevant change , apart from a rescaling of the reduced temperature and of the energy and the free energy of a factor @xmath58 , leaving the entropy invariant . in order to make a comparison with the results shown there ,",
    "it is enough to multiply @xmath57 , the free energy and the energy shown in the present paper by a factor @xmath59 .",
    "the 3-sat model belongs to the family of spin models interacting via quenched random couplings .",
    "these are described by a random hamiltonian @xmath60 $ ] where @xmath61 are the random `` quenched '' couplings .",
    "for example , in the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xmath61 is a symmetric gaussian matrix of zero mean and variance proportional to @xmath62 @xcite , while in its @xmath1-spin generalization the variance goes like @xmath63 @xcite . for the 3-sat problem the disorder is introduced by the random clauses imposed on the set of variables . in the simple limit that we are considering here ,",
    "the quenched disorder is represented by the random @xmath64 variables @xmath65 , assigning a clause on the three sites @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite .    for any fixed coupling realization @xmath61",
    ", the partition function of the spin system , with @xmath12 spins , is given by @xcite @xmath69= \\mbox{tr}_{\\sigma}\\ \\exp\\bigl(-\\beta { \\cal h}[j;\\sigma]\\bigr)\\ ] ] and the quenched free energy per spin is @xmath70\\ p[j]\\ \\ln z_n[j]\\ ] ] where @xmath71 indicates the average over the couplings realizations .",

    "the analytic computation of the quenched free energy , i.e. , of the average of the logarithm of the partition function , is a quite difficult problem , even in simple cases as nearest neighbour one dimensional models .",
    "however , since the integer moments of the partition function are easier to compute , the standard method uses the so called `` replica trick '' by considering the annealed free energy @xmath74 of @xmath75 non - interacting ` replicas ' of the system @xcite , @xmath76)^n }                                                 \\right].\\ ] ] the quenched free energy of the original system is then recovered as the continuation of @xmath74 down to the unphysical limit @xmath77 , @xmath78)^n } - 1\\over n\\beta n }        = \\lim_{n\\to 0 } f(n).\\ ] ] in the last equality we assumed that the replica limit and the thermodynamic limit can be exchanged .",
