    "elliptical galaxies define a fundamental plane ( fp ) on the 3-parameter space of the half - light radius @xmath10 , the mean surface brightness within that radius @xmath11 , and the central velocity dispersion @xmath12 ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "the scatter around the fp is only @xmath13 dex in log@xmath10 for cluster ellipticals .",
    "the existence of this scaling relation provides one of the most important constraints to model the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies ( bender et al 1993 ; guzmn et al .",
    "1993 ; renzini & ciotti 1993 ; zepf & silk 1996 ) .",
    "also , it can be used as a distance indicator to trace the non - hubble motions in the local universe ( dressler et al 1987b ; lucey & carter 1988 ; lynden - bell et al .",
    "1988 ) , and potentially as a cosmological evolutionary probe when studying the fp for cluster ellipticals at higher redshifts ( franx et al . 1996",
    "; van dokkum & franx 1996 ; barger et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the biparametric nature of elliptical galaxies suggests that the virial theorem is the main constraint on their structure ( faber et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski 1987 ; but see guzmn et al .",
    "the tilt of the fp relative to the virial equation implies a systematic variation either in the imf , the shape of the light profile , the age and metallicity or the dark and luminous matter distribution with galaxy mass ( guzmn et al .",
    "1993 ; ciotti et al .",
    "our understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for such variation is still at a very early stage .",
    "moreover , substantial fine - tuning is required to produce the tilt while preserving the small scatter of the galaxy distribution along the fp ( ciotti et al .",
    "the tightness of the fp for cluster ellipticals is clear evidence for a very standardized and synchronized production of ellipticals , with the vast majority of their stellar populations being formed at redshifts @xmath14 , at least for those ellipticals in clusters ( renzini 1995 ; ellis et al .",
    ". however , there is growing evidence that ellipticals outside the core of rich clusters tend to have a younger stellar component ( rose 1985 ; pickles 1985 ; bower et al .",
    "1990 ) . as a result ,",
    "non - cluster ellipticals at a given @xmath10 and/or @xmath12 have , on average , bluer colours , higher effective surface brightnesses , and lower @xmath15 line strength indices as compared to their cluster counterparts ( larson et al .",
    "1980 ; guzmn et al .",
    "1992 ; de carvalho & djorgovski 1992 ) .",
    "this systematic variation of stellar population properties due to the environment may in turn translate into a zero - point offset of the fp - based distance indicators ( such as @xmath16 ) and thus lead to spurious peculiar velocities ( kaiser 1988 ; silk 1989 ; de carvalho & djorgovski 1992 ; but see burstein et al .",
    "1990 ) . indeed , using stellar population evolutionary models , guzmn & lucey ( 1993 )",
    "have combined the fp with the @xmath17 relation to create a new distance indicator that is independent of age / environmental differences . when the new distance indicator is applied to the ellipticals with a younger stellar component ,",
    "the large positive peculiar motions previously reported are greatly removed ( guzmn & lucey 1993 ) .",
    "most studies on the fp have been done at optical wavelengths .",
    "observations in the infrared may shed light on the origin of the tilt and scatter of the fp by probing a wavelength region with a different sensitivity to stellar population effects .",
    "in particular , the effect of age and/or metallicity variations in ellipticals is expected to be greatly reduced in the k - band ( i.e. , 2.2@xmath0 ) since the galaxy light at these wavelengths is mainly sensitive to the old stellar component and is less affected by line - blanketing . moreover , the k - band is significantly less sensitive to both the presence of dust in ellipticals and galactic extinction .",
    "the new k - band fp can also be used as an independent distance indicator to check for stellar - population effects on the peculiar velocity measurements derived using the fp in the optical . early work on the infrared fp relied on single element photometry and hence , lacked detailed surface photometry ( gregg 1995a ; recillas - cruz et al .",
    "1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "recently , pahre et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that the coefficients and scatter of the fp in the k - band for a sample of ellipticals in five nearby clusters are similar to those derived in the optical .",
    "they conclude that the observed small differences are consistent with the reduction of metallicity effects in the near - infared bandpass .    in this paper",
    ", we present the first results of a large - scale k - band survey of elliptical galaxies located in different environments ( i.e. , clusters , field and great attractor region ) . here",
    "we study the coefficients and scatter of the k - band fp , using accurate surface photometry for a homogeneous sample of 48 galaxies in the coma cluster . by considering a single cluster ,",
    "we avoid introducing artificial scatter due to distance errors or non - universality of the fp .",
    "the aim of this study is three fold : 1 ) to shed light on the origin of the fp by using a wavelength region with a different sensitivity to the stellar population effects than the optical ; 2 ) to establish the intrinsic scatter on the k - band fp ; and 3 ) to set the zero - point of the new infrared distance scale using the k - band fp for coma cluster ellipticals .    in the next section ,",
    "the observations and data reduction are discussed .",
    "this is followed by the study of the near - infrared scaling laws in section 3 .",
    "the implications for the origin of the fp and the new distance scale are discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",

    "near - infrared k - band ( 2.2 @xmath0 ) images of 48 elliptical galaxies in the coma cluster were obtained , using the @xmath18 infrared array detector ( ircam3 ) with a pixel size of @xmath19 .",

    "they are located at different distances from the center of the coma cluster ( @xmath20 12 57 19 @xmath21 28 15 51 ( 1950 ) ) . also , they have optical half - light diameters smaller than @xmath22 , fitting the field of view of the ircam3 .",
    "an exposure time of 10 sec . was used with 6 co - adds . for each object ,",
    "nine exposures were taken at different positions , separated by @xmath23 , giving a total integration time of 9 mins . per object .",
    "this technique was employed to avoid the effect of bad pixels and cosmic rays , to construct reliable flatfields for each frame and to measure the sky background .",
    "surface photometry of smaller galaxies can be affected by the seeing condition which was estimated to be around @xmath24 .",
    "the sensitivity of the results to this effect will be explored in the following analysis .",
    "observations of faint ukirt standards were also carried out during the night and were used to monitor the accuracy of the photometry .",
    "observations were dark subtracted using the dark frames closest ( in time ) to each object . for each galaxy , the nine mosaic frames were then median filtered and the result normalised to its median pixel value to construct the flatfield .",
    "the dark subtracted , flatfielded frames were then registered and mosaiced to increase the s / n .",
    "the data reduction was carried out , using the ccdpack software in the starlink environment .",
    "the median sky value was then estimated for each frame individually and used to sky - subtract that frame .",
    "the mosaic frames , providing a larger sky coverage than single frames , were used for this purpose and the sky values were measured as far away from the center of galaxy as possible .",
    "the variations in sky estimates at different positions on the frame were monitored , giving a measure of the uncertainties in these values .",
    "this did not exceed 0.02 mag .",
    ", even for the bigger galaxies for which the uncertainties are larger . therefore , this is taken as our estimated error due to sky subtraction .",
    "the standard stars were reduced in the same way and used to establish the extinction relation for each night .",
    "changes in the zero - points , estimated from the standards throughout the run ( internal photometric error ) , is 0.02 mag .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the final images and used to construct the near - ir growth curves for individual galaxies .",
    "the magnitudes were corrected for atmospheric extinction , galactic absorption ( taking @xmath25 ( pahre et al .",
    "1996 ) and the median @xmath26 for the coma galaxies from faber et al ( 1989 ) ) and redshift effect ( assuming @xmath27 for ellipticals at the k - band ( persson et al ( 1979 ) ) .",
    "the photometric accuracy is checked by comparing magnitudes of the objects in our sample with the same galaxies from other independent observations .",
    "the k - band magnitudes for 18 galaxies in the present sample , in common with bower et al ( 1992 ) , are measured over an aperture of @xmath28 diameter , used by these authors .",
    "the two magnitudes are compared in figure 1a and show a mean offset of @xmath29 with an rms scatter of 0.03 mag . assuming equal errors in both the data sets , this corresponds to an internal error of @xmath30 mag . per galaxy ,",
    "consistent with that claimed by bower et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "the cause of the zero - point offset between the two data sets is not clear but is likely to be due to different detectors used .",
    "however , since the data here are 2-d and bower et al s is based on single element photometry , we expect to have a more accurate control over the sky subtraction in our data .",
    "neverthless , the offset is relatively small .",
    "the growth curves , corrected for galactic absorption and redshift effects , were used to construct near - infrared surface brightness profiles for each galaxy , corrected for the @xmath31 surface brightness dimming .",
    "near - infrared isophotal diameters , corresponding to a mean surface brightness of 16.5 mag / arcsec@xmath32 are then estimated .",
    "this isophote was adopted to be directly comparable with the mean optical surface brightness of 19.8 mag / arcsec.@xmath32 ( assuming @xmath33 mag . for ellipticals ) used in the optical @xmath34 relation . to examine the accuracy of our surface photometry , we have also obtained data for a sub - set of 12 ellipticals in our sample , using the iris at the anglo - australian telescope ( march 1995 ) .",
    "these diameters , measured at a mean k - band surface brightness of 16.5 mag./arcsec@xmath32 , are compared with the present measurements in figure 1b and show a mean offset of @xmath35 with an rms scatter of 0.019 dex .",
    "assuming that the uncertainty in these measurements is shared equally between both the data sets , we estimate an observational error of 0.01 dex in log(@xmath36 ) values .",
    "the diameters of smaller galaxies in our sample might be affected by the seeing condition . to estimate this effect",
    ", we used the models in lucey et al ( 1991 ) and estimated the effect of 1 arcsec seeing on the aperture photometry ( the observations here were done in 0.8 - 1.2 arcsec seeing conditions ) .",
    "the correction was then applied to one of our smaller galaxies and its photometric parameters were recalculated .",
    "we find that at 1 arcsec seeing conditions , an increase in log(@xmath36 ) of only 0.01 dex was needed due to seeing .",
    "the diameters of larger galaxies were almost insensitive to this effect .",
    "the range in surface brightness values between 16 and 17 mag / arcsec@xmath32 was explored in 0.1 intervals .",
    "the results in the following sections were found to be insensitive to the actual choice of the isophote .",
    "the near - infrared effective diameter and surface brightness ( i.e. the diameter containing half the total luminosity of a galaxy and the mean surface brightness within that diameter ) were calculated for galaxies in the present sample by fitting the observed k - band curve of growths to the de vaucouleurs @xmath37 law .",
    "the accuracy of this fitting procedure was estimated by generating simulated profiles following the @xmath37 law with known effective parameters and artificially added noise , analogous to the photometric errors .",
    "an @xmath37 fit to these profiles recovers both the input effective parameters , giving errors of @xmath38 and 0.03 mag / arcsec@xmath32 in the effective diameter and surface brightness values respectively .",

    "these galaxies are indistinguishable from the rest of the ellipticals on the near - ir fp in the coma cluster ( fig 2 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the near - ir fp to changes in the stellar population and metallicity among the ellipticals are further investigated by comparing the @xmath47 ( fp ) values with the mg@xmath8 index and v - k colour residuals ( at a given @xmath12 ) from the mg@xmath59 and ( v - k)@xmath60 relations respectively ( figure 3 ) .",

    "these scenarios are currently explored by extending the study of the near - infrared fp to the field ellipticals .",

    "7 ) , using the empirical mg@xmath8-@xmath12 relation derived from the present sample .",
    "we find that the ( v@xmath9k)-@xmath12 relations , predicted by bruzual and charlot ( 1996 ) model , have similar slopes due to changes in metallicity ( at a given age ) or age ( at a given metallicity ) .",
    "this confirms that the results in figures 5 and 7 are independent of the models used ( ie .",
    "the metallicity and age trends are degenerate ) .",
    "the @xmath79 relation is independent of distance and hence , can be used to study evolution of ellipticals at different environments ( i.e. in field and clusters ) and redshifts .",
    "this relation can also be used to estimate velocity dispersion of ellipticals at high redshifts ( for which a spectroscopic measurement of @xmath12 is difficult ) , using their v@xmath9k colours and allowing for evolution with redshift . the accuracy in log(@xmath12 )",
    "values , estimated from the ( v@xmath9k)-@xmath12 relation , is 0.11 dex .",
    "the near - infrared fp found here differs , at a high confidence level , from that expected from a pure virial theorem if light directly traces the mass and if ellipticals are dynamically and structurally homologous ( @xmath88 ; where @xmath89 is the effective surface brightness in units of luminosity per area and @xmath90 is the effective diameter ) .",
    "this leads to a relation between the near - ir mass - to - luminosity ratios @xmath91 and mass @xmath92 of the ellipticals ( fig .",
    "8)- ( faber et al 1987 ; djorgovski 1987 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 and mass estimates in figure 8 are in solar units , assuming @xmath93 for the coma and @xmath94 km / sec / mpc .",
    "this relation is consistent with @xmath95 where @xmath96 , in excellent agreement with @xmath97 estimated from a k - band study of 59 ellipticals in 5 nearby clusters ( pahre et al 1996 ; see also recillas - cruz et al 1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "to investigate the origin of this relation and explore if it is caused by differences in the dark - to - luminous matter distribution among the ellipticals or is due to changes in metallicity , age or stellar population , we extend this study to optical wavelengths , using the same sample of galaxies ( fig .",
    "the optical relation has a steeper slope of @xmath98 , indicating that over the same range in mass , the optical and infrared m / l ratios change by factors of 3 and 2.3 respectively .",
    "the slight wavelength dependence of the slope of the m / l @xmath99 m relation implies that changes in the luminous - to - dark matter distribution and/or luminosity profile among the ellipticals is not the only parameter responsible for the observed relations .",
    "other observable parameters ( see below ) , are also likely to be as important .    in order to have an entirely independent measurement of the slope of the m / l @xmath99 m relations in the two passbands , we estimate both the m / l ratios and masses of individual galaxies , using their respective effective diameters in the near - ir and optical wavelengths .",
    "however , this introduces the unphysical effect of the dependence of the dynamical mass on the wavelength in figure 8 .",
    "therefore , the shift in the masses of the same object between the optical and near - infrared ( m / l ) @xmath99 m relations in figure 8 is due to differences in the shape of the surface brightness profiles in the two bands , and to observational uncertainties in the values of the effective diameters .",
    "nevertheless , using the effective diameters measured only in one passband to estimate the mass of galaxies , the slope of the m / l @xmath99 m relations remain the same as above , indicating that the conclusions in this section do not depend on different effective diameters for individual galaxies , used to estimate the mass .",
    "the effects of stellar population , metallicity and age on the near - infrared mass - to - luminosity ratios of the ellipticals are investigated in fig 9 , using v - k colours and mg@xmath8 line indices . employing the stellar synthesis models of worthey ( 1994 ) , changes in the ( m / l)@xmath100 with age and metallicity",
    "are calculated for 5 gyrs @xmath101 17 gyrs at constant metallicities of [ fe / h]=-0.25 , 0 and 0.25 and for a range in metallicity corresponding to @xmath102<0.5 $ ] at a constant age of 12 gyrs .",
    "the models , normalised to have @xmath103 at 12 gyrs and [ fe / h]=0 , are compared with the data in figs 9a and 9b .",
    "there is only a weak dependence of the near - ir mass - to - luminosity ratio on metallicity .",
    "furthermore , the effects of age and metallicity in ellipticals , as shown in fig . 9 , decouple when using their ( m / l)@xmath100 estimates ( ie .",
    "the age and metallicity sequences are orthogonal ) .",
    "assuming the same ` collapse factor ' ( the ratio of the radius covering half the total mass to the effective radius ) for all the elliptical galaxies in our sample .",
    "figures 9a and 9b suggest that the age is responsible for the observed trends on both the ( m / l)@xmath104mg@xmath8 and ( m / l)@xmath104(v@xmath9k ) diagrams while metallicity mainly contributes to the scatter in these relations .",
    "the near - infrared fp is less affected by differences in line blanketing , metallicity and stellar population among the ellipticals , compared to its optical counterpart .",
    "this implies a fp relation with a potentially reduced scatter at the near - infrared wavelength .",
    "therefore , the similarity of the rms scatter between the near - ir ( 0.072 dex ) and optical ( 0.074 dex ) fps found here , was unexpected and could have important implications for constraining models of formation of ellipticals .",
    "understanding the origin of this scatter provides a challenge in studying the evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "study of the scatter around the optical fp with ellipticity ( ie .",
    "shape ) has found no relation between the two quantities ( jorgensen et al 1996 ; jorgensen et al 1993 ) .",
    "as discussed in section 3.4 , it is likely that changes in the @xmath7 among ellipticals is responsible for at least part of the scatter in their near - infrared fp .",
    "this may be caused by differences in age and/or metallicity ( figure 9 ) , contributions from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) population to their near - infrared light or differences in matter distribution and the internal dynamics ( ie .",
    "orbital anisotropy or rotation ; bender et al 1993 ) among the ellipticals .",
    "however , similarity of the scatter between the optical and near - infrared fp relations indicates that structural and dynamical differences rather than changes in age / metallicity or the agb contributions among the ellipticals are probably responsible for the observed scatter in their near - infrared fp .    the tightness of the fp has been exploited in estimating relative distances between elliptical galaxies in the field or clusters .",
    "however , the optical fp is affected by contributions from the young population or residual star formation .",
    "indeed , it is likely that the relatively blue ellipticals , found in the great attractor region , are responsible for the proposed streaming motion ( guzman and lucey 1993 ) .",
    "the near - infrared fp may be less sensitive to this effect ( see section 3.1 ) and hence , the fp at this wavelength is expected to have a more stable slope and zero - point .",
    "therefore , this relation can be used to test the reality of the streaming motion and its dependence on the non - uniformity of stellar populations among the ellipticals . for this purpose",
    ", we have performed near - ir ( k - band ) imaging observations of a sub - sample of ellipticals in the great attractor region . using the present sample of ellipticals in the coma cluster , we establish the zero - point of the field near - ir fp in order to use this to explore the sensitivity of the streaming motion to changes in stellar populations among the ellipticals .",
    "these results will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "recent studies have indicated that elliptical galaxies are not the homogeneous population once assumed and are likely to have a complex evolutionary history involving interaction , starburst and infall of material ( white and frenk 1991 ; cole et al .",
    "this leads to changes in the luminosity , mass and morphology of these galaxies with time , implying that their progenitors may be distinctly different from the galaxies we see today .",
    "a study of the fp of ellipticals at high redshift is needed to address these scenarios .",
    "recently , using the high resolution imaging capability of the hubble space telescope and spectroscopic facilities on the largest ground - based telescopes ( mmt and keck ) , it has become possible to explore the evolution of the optical fp and m / l of ellipticals with redshift ( franx et al 1996 ; van dokkum & franx 1996 ; barger et al 1996 ) .",
    "this reveals a fp similar to those at low redshift with a comparable scatter .",
    "however , the observed change in the optical m / l is found to be smaller than that expected from population synthesis models based on a given metallicity , imf and formation redshift ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) . with the installation of the near - infrared ( nicmos ) detectors on the hst , it is now possible to extend this study to longer wavelengths .",
    "the near - infrared light mainly measures the integrated star formation and hence , is more closely related to the mass function of the ellipticals .",
    "therefore , study of the evolution of near - infrared fp and m / l of ellipticals with redshift constrains the infall and merging in these galaxies and is needed for a careful interpretation of the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "the results of this study can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the near - infrared ( 2.2 @xmath0 ) fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies in the coma cluster is studied , using a sample of 48 galaxies .",
    "this shows an rms scatter of 0.072 dex , similar to its optical counterpart , corresponding to an accuracy of @xmath1 in distances derived from this relation . +",
    "no relation is found between the scatter around the near - infrared fp and the v@xmath9k colours or mg@xmath8 line strengths in ellipticals , probably implying negligible contribution to this relation due to changes in metallicity or the young population among the coma cluster ellipticals .",
    "the agb stars are proposed as the likely source responsible for the observed scatter in the near - ir fp .",
    "allowing for observational uncertainties , we estimate an intrinsic scatter of 0.060 dex in this relation .",
    "2 .   the @xmath61 and @xmath73 relations are studied .",
    "these have an rms scatter of 0.073 dex and 0.50 mag . respectively , compared to scatters of 0.077 dex and 0.49 mag . for their optical counterparts .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the slopes of these relations lead to correlations between @xmath105 and ( v - k ) with the mass ( @xmath12 ) of ellipticals . using stellar synthesis models",
    ", we interprete these as due to an age or metallicity ( or a combination of these two ) effect . however , it is not possible to disentangle the effect of age and metallicity , using these parameters .",
    "the relation between the m / l ratio and the mass of ellipticals ( @xmath106 ) in the coma cluster is studied .",
    "the slight difference in the slope of this relation between the infrared ( @xmath5 ) and optical ( @xmath6 ) wavelengths is caused by a mass - metallicity relation and not due to changes in the luminous - to - dark matter distribution among the ellipticals .",
    "4 .   using the stellar synthesis models",
    ", we disentangle the effects of age and metallicity on the ( m / l)@xmath104mg@xmath8 and ( m / l)@xmath104(v@xmath9k ) diagrams . the trend in these relations",
    "is interpreted as an age sequence while metallicity mainly contributs to its scatter .",
    "we propose the use of ( m / l)@xmath100 to separate the effects of age and metallicity in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we propose to use the near - infrared fp of ellipticals in the coma cluster to fix the zero - point of its corresponding field sample in the great attractor region .",
    "this is required in order to explore the effect of stellar population and metallicity on the estimates of the streaming motion of galaxies .",
