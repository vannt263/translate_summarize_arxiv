    "recently a significant experimental progress has been achieved in studying the heavy baryon spectroscopy . in the last five years",
    "the number of the observed charmed and bottom baryons almost doubled and now it is nearly the same as the number of known charmed and bottom mesons @xcite . observations of new charmed baryons were mainly done at the @xmath2-factories , while new bottom baryons were discovered at tevatron @xcite . it is expected that new data on excited bottom baryons will come soon from the lhc , where they are supposed to be copiously produced . due to the poor statistics ,",
    "the quantum numbers of most of the excited states of heavy baryons are not known experimentally and are usually prescribed following the quark model predictions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate heavy baryon spectroscopy in the framework of the qcd - motivated relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach @xcite .",
    "to simplify the very complicated relativistic three - body problem heavy baryons are considered in the heavy - quark  light - diquark approximation .",
    "this reduces the initial three - body problem to two step two - body calculations .",
    "first , the light diquark properties , such as masses and form factors , are presented @xcite .",
    "then a heavy baryon is considered as the bound system of a heavy quark and a light diquark . in order to take into account the rather large size and structure of the light diquark",
    ", its nonlocal interaction with gluons is described by the form factor expressed in terms of the diquark wave functions .",
    "all heavy baryon excitations , both orbital and radial , are assumed to occur in the bound system of the heavy quark and light diquark , while the latter is taken only in the ground ( scalar or axial vector ) state .",
    "such scheme significantly reduces the number of the excited baryon states compared to the genuine three - quark picture .",
    "the goal of this paper is the calculation of the masses of the excited heavy baryons up to rather high orbital and radial excitations .",
    "this will allow us to construct the heavy baryon regge trajectories both in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 planes , where @xmath5 is the baryon spin , @xmath6 is the baryon mass and @xmath7 is the radial quantum number . then we can test their linearity , parallelism and equidistance and determine their parameters : regge slopes and intercepts .",
    "their determination is of great importance , since they provide a better understanding of the hadron dynamics . moreover , their knowledge is also important for non - spectroscopic problems such as , e.g. , hadron production and high energy scattering .",
    "since we are going to calculate highly excited heavy baryon states it is important to use a fully relativistic approach , which does not use the nonrelativistic @xmath0 expansion for light quarks and diquarks and does not employ the heavy quark @xmath1 expansion for the heavy quark .",
    "the heavy baryon spectroscopy has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "various quark models @xcite , heavy quark @xmath1 and @xmath8 expansions @xcite , quenched and unquenched lattice calculations @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite have been used . however , in all these calculations either masses of the ground state baryons were obtained or only a few lowest orbital and radial excitations were considered .",
    "therefore the regge trajectories of heavy baryons have not been constructed .",
    "contrarily , the regge trajectories of light baryons received significant attention @xcite .",
    "the related investigations were performed on the basis of quark models @xcite , empirical relations @xcite and in models based on the ads / qcd duality @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the highly orbitally excited light baryons have an antisymmetric structure of the quark - diquark type @xcite and such configuration minimizes the energy @xcite . only in this case",
    "light baryon and meson regge trajectories have the same slope @xcite   which is in agreement with experimental data .    several simple relations between slopes and intercepts of light and heavy baryons have been deduced in different models within qcd ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . they were used for obtaining various linear and quadratic mass relations between baryon masses @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rqdm ] we present the relativistic quark - diquark model of heavy baryons .",
    "first we discuss properties of light diquarks and give their masses and form factors .",
    "then a heavy baryon is considered as the bound system of a heavy quark and a light diquark .",
    "the completely relativistic expressions for the corresponding quasipotentials are given . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rd ] the heavy baryon spectroscopy is presented and discussed .",
    "our predictions for charmed and bottom baryon masses are confronted with the available experimental data .",
    "the obtained results are used for constructing the heavy baryon regge trajectories both in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 planes .",
    "the prescription of the observed baryon states to the particular trajectory allows to determine their quantum numbers",
    ". then we obtain slopes and intercepts of parent and daughter trajectories and test the proposed relations between them .",
    "finally , a comparison of the slopes of the heavy meson and heavy baryon regge trajectories is performed .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "in the quasipotential approach and quark - diquark picture of heavy baryons the interaction of two light quarks in a diquark and the heavy quark interaction with a light diquark in a baryon are described by the diquark wave function ( @xmath9 ) of the bound quark - quark state and by the baryon wave function ( @xmath10 ) of the bound quark - diquark state respectively , which satisfy the quasipotential equation of the schrdinger type @xcite @xmath11 where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the bound state mass ( diquark or baryon ) , @xmath17 are the masses of light quarks ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) which form the diquark or of the light diquark ( @xmath20 ) and heavy quark ( @xmath21 ) which form the heavy baryon ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath22 is their relative momentum . in the center of mass system",
    "the relative momentum squared on mass shell reads @xmath23[m^2-(m_1-m_2)^2]}{4m^2}.\\ ] ]    the kernel @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ quas ] ) is the quasipotential operator of the quark - quark or quark - diquark interaction .",
    "it is constructed with the help of the off - mass - shell scattering amplitude , projected onto the positive energy states . in the following analysis",
    "we closely follow the similar construction of the quark - antiquark interaction in mesons which were extensively studied in our relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "for the quark - quark interaction in a diquark we use the relation @xmath25 arising under the assumption about the octet structure of the interaction from the difference of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 colour antitriplet and singlet states . an important role in this construction",
    "is played by the lorentz - structure of the nonperturbative confining interaction . in our analysis of mesons , while constructing the quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction , we adopted that the effective interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term with the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli term .",
    "we use the same conventions for the construction of the quark - quark and quark - diquark interactions in the baryon .",
    "the quasipotential is then defined by the following expressions @xcite    \\(a ) for the quark - quark ( @xmath26 ) interaction in the colour antitriplet state @xmath28 with @xmath29,\\ ] ]    \\(b ) for quark - diquark ( @xmath30 ) interaction in the colour singlet state @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath33 is the vertex of the diquark - gluon interaction which takes into account the diquark internal structure , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge , @xmath38 ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the dirac matrices and spinors @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the diquark state in the confining part of the quark - diquark quasipotential ( [ dpot ] ) is described by the wave functions @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the polarization vector of the axial vector diquark .",
    "the effective long - range vector vertex of the diquark can be presented in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the antisymmetric tensor @xmath48 and the axial vector diquark spin @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 .",
    "we choose the total chromomagnetic moment of the axial vector diquark @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the effective long - range vector vertex of the quark is defined by @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the pauli interaction constant characterizing the anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks . in the configuration space",
    "the vector and scalar confining potentials in the nonrelativistic limit reduce to @xmath54 with @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "the constituent quark masses @xmath57 gev , @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 gev , and the parameters of the linear potential @xmath61 gev@xmath62 and @xmath63 gev have the usual values of quark models .",
    "the value of the mixing coefficient of vector and scalar confining potentials @xmath64 has been determined from the consideration of charmonium radiative decays @xcite and the heavy quark expansion @xcite .",
    "finally , the universal pauli interaction constant @xmath65 has been fixed from the analysis of the fine splitting of heavy quarkonia @xmath66- states @xcite .",
    "note that the long - range chromomagnetic contribution to the potential in our model is proportional to @xmath67 and thus vanishes for the chosen value of @xmath65 .",
    "since we deal with diquarks and baryons containing light quarks we adopt for the qcd coupling constant @xmath68 the simplest model with freezing @xcite , namely @xmath69 where the scale is taken as @xmath70 , the background mass is @xmath71  gev @xcite , and @xmath72  mev was fixed from fitting the @xmath73 mass @xcite .",
    "note that an other popular parametrization of @xmath32 with freezing @xcite leads to close values .      at the first step , we present the masses and form factors of the light diquark @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the light quarks are highly relativistic , which makes the @xmath0 expansion inapplicable and thus , a completely relativistic treatment is required . to achieve this goal in describing light diquarks ,",
    "we closely follow our consideration of the light meson spectra @xcite and adopt the same procedure to make the relativistic quark potential local by replacing @xmath74 ( see ( [ ee ] ) and discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the quasipotential equation ( [ quas ] ) is solved numerically for the complete relativistic potential which depends on the diquark mass in a complicated highly nonlinear way @xcite .",
    "the obtained ground state masses of scalar and axial vector light diquarks are presented in table  [ tab : dmass ] .    in order to determine the diquark interaction with the gluon field @xmath33 , which takes into account the diquark structure ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the corresponding matrix element of the quark current between diquark states .",
    "this diagonal matrix element can be parametrized by the set of elastic form factors in the following way    \\(a ) scalar diquark ( @xmath75 ) @xmath76    \\(b ) axial vector diquark ( @xmath77 ) @xmath78h_1(k^2)(p+q)_\\mu\\cr & & + h_2(k^2 )",

    "the calculation of the matrix element of the quark current @xmath81 between the diquark states leads to the emergence of the form factor @xmath82 entering the vertex of the diquark - gluon interaction @xcite . then the elastic form factors in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sff ] ) and ( [ eq : avff ] ) are expressed by @xmath83 where the form factor @xmath82 is given by the overlap integral of the diquark wave functions . using the numerical diquark wave functions we find that @xmath82 can be approximated with high accuracy by the expression @xcite @xmath84 the values of the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the ground states of the scalar @xmath87 $ ] and axial vector @xmath88 light diquarks",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is important to compare the values of the slopes of the regge trajectories for heavy baryons , heavy - light and light mesons . from the comparison of the heavy baryon slopes in tables  [ tab : rtj ] , [ tab : rtn ]",
    "we see that the @xmath93 values are systematically larger than the @xmath94 ones .",
    "the ratio of their mean values is about 1.5 both for the charmed and bottom baryons .",
    "this value of the ratio is very close to the one found for the heavy - light mesons @xcite and is slightly larger than the one ( 1.3 ) obtained for the light mesons @xcite .    from comparison of tables  [ tab : rtj ] , [ tab : rtn ] and tables  4 , 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite we find that for the same flavour of the heavy quark the heavy baryon slopes have higher values than the heavy - light meson ones .",
    "it is interesting that the ratios of the heavy baryon to heavy - light meson slopes ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) have very close values , which are about 1.4 , both in the ( @xmath97 ) and in ( @xmath98 ) planes .",
    "note that light baryons and light mesons have almost equal values of the regge trajectory slopes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper the spectroscopy of charmed and bottom baryons was studied in the framework of the quark - diquark picture in the relativistic quark model .",
    "the heavy baryon was considered as a heavy - quark  light - diquark bound system in which excitations occur only between a heavy quark and a light diquark .",
    "the light diquarks were considered only in the ground ( either scalar or axial vector ) state .",
    "the diquarks were not treated as point - like objects .",
    "their internal structure was taken into account by including form factors of the diquark - gluon interaction in terms of the diquark wave functions .",
    "the dynamics of light quarks inside a diquark as well as the dynamics of a light diquark and a heavy quark inside a baryon were treated completely relativistically without application of either the nonrelativistic @xmath0 or heavy quark @xmath1 expansions .",
    "such nonperturbative approach is especially important for the highly excited charmed baryon states , where the heavy quark expansion is not adequate enough .",
    "it is important to emphasize that all parameters of our relativistic quark model such as quark masses and parameters of the interquark potential were fixed previously form the investigation of meson mass spectra and decay processes .",
    "thus our model provides a unified universal description of meson and baryon properties .",
    "we calculated the masses of ground , orbitally and radially excited heavy baryons up to rather high excitations ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "this allowed us to construct the regge trajectories both in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 planes .",
    "it was found that they are almost linear , parallel and equidistant .",
    "the available experimental data nicely fit to them .",
    "the assignment of the experimentally observed heavy baryons to the particular regge trajectories was carried out .",
    "this allowed us to determine the quantum numbers of the excited heavy baryons .",
    "it was found that all currently available experimental data can be well described in the relativistic quark - diquark picture , which predicts significantly less states than the genuine three - body picture .",
    "the comparison of the slopes of the regge trajectories of heavy baryons and heavy - light mesons was given .",
    "it was found that the slope values of heavy baryons are approximately 1.4 times higher than the ones of heavy mesons with the same flavour of the heavy quark .",
