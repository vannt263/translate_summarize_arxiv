    "the theory of isothermic surfaces in conformal geometry has been the focus for intense research over the past years due to its relation with the theory of integrable systems ; see for instance @xcite and the literature therein .    among isothermic surfaces darboux",

    "examples include surfaces of constant mean curvature ( cmc ) .",
    "this article has its origins in the two seminal papers of bianchi @xcite on isothermic surfaces and deals with special isothermic surfaces of type @xmath0 , henceforth simply referred to as special isothermic .",
    "these surfaces are invariant under the group of conformal transformations .",
    "since the work of bianchi , it has been known that umbilic free special isothermic surfaces are conformally equivalent to cmc surfaces in 3-dimensional space forms .",
    "examples of special isothermic surfaces with umbilic lines can be constructed by revolving elastic curves in the hyperbolic half - plane about the boundary at infinity ( cf .",
