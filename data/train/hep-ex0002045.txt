    "experiment e761 , `` an electroweak enigma : hyperon radiative decays '' @xcite was my first encounter with experimental high energy physics .",
    "i got experience on silicon micro strip and wire chamber detectors , magnet spectrometers for momentum precision measurements , data acquisition and trigger systems based on nim and camac , reconstruction and analysis packages , and performed high precision physics measurements of the magnetic moment and of the and production polarization @xcite .",
    "this experiment now represents the starting push for the particle physics group at san luis potos .",
    "there are several aspects to talk about selex , recent hyperon and charm physics results , i only highlight a few of them .    also prior to talk about physics i should mention that e781 or selex is the first experiment where san luis potos is a formal collaborating institution .",
    "two students have gotten their master degree thesis related to selex , ricardo lpez fernndez working in the rich group and analyzing the beam composition using the rich , and galileo domnguez zacaras working with the sample looking into @xmath0 asymmetry @xcite .",
    "personally i worked in the smart crate controller in the camac setup and trigger installation .",
    "an impact at san luis potos also happen in relation to this collaboration : jrgen engelfried , member of selex and previously wa89 at cern , accepted to work as professor at san luis potos , his expertise brings more life and conforms the local group and opens more physics opportunities as i ll discuss in the section `` the near future '' .",
    "selex is a new fixed target experiment designed to enhance charm - strange baryon over meson data .",
    "the data taking lasted from summer 1996 to fall 1997 .",
    "it includes a tagged hadron beam on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and proton using a trd detector ; a micro - vertex detector , and particle i d using trd , lead glass , and rich detectors ; all these detectors distributed among three magnet spectrometers @xcite .",
    "selex was designed to be a high charm baryon spectrometer , and in fact this can be appreciated by the high acceptance at @xmath2 0.5 . in the three modes , , , and , the acceptance is grater than 6 % , and identical for particle and antiparticle decays .",
    "the control on the acceptance gives the opportunity to study charm baryon production as a function of with very good precision for challenging theoretical models and other experiments @xcite .",
    "charm baryon and meson lifetime measurements are also under control in the experiment .",
    "selex was designed with a trigger to enhance all charm baryon production and decay modes , as a result it has the ability to look for unseen decay modes , right now selex is reporting the first observation of cabibbo suppressed decay @xcite .    the fact of having a beam to study charm production also provides by its own nature the tool to study properties of the hyperon itself . at present",
    "there are preliminary reports on radius and total cross section of beam on different target material @xcite .",
    "on april 26 1996 , fermilab invited physicists for a workshop towards the use of a 120 gev / c proton beam on collider and fixed target mode .",
    "all mexican groups had the opportunity for joining this activity .",
    "the event really represented a great opportunity for young mexican groups since the enterprises are small in size and with a lot of opportunities to start at the zero point of the design and construction for leading a project or subproject .",
    "of all the mexican existing groups only san luis potos , so far , has taken the challenge to participate actively in one of these experiments .",
    "ckm `` charged kaons at the main injector '' , a proposal for a precision measurement of the decay and other rare processes at fermilab using the main injector , is one of the experiments which were born after the april 96 workshop @xcite .",
    "the experiment will measure the branching ratio of the ultra - rare charged kaon decay by observing a large sample of those decays with small background .",
    "the physics goal is to measure the magnitude of the cabibbo , kobayashi , maskawa matrix element @xmath3 with a statistical precision of about 5% based upon a @xmath4  100 event sample with total backgrounds of less than 10 events .",
    "this decay mode is known to be theoretically clean .",
    "the only significant theoretical uncertainty in the calculation of this branching ratio is due to the charm contribution .",
    "a 10% measurement of the branching ratio will yield a 10% total uncertainty on the magnitude of @xmath3 .    in this experiment",
    "if - uaslp is in charge for testing parts and the whole design of two ring imaging cherenkov counters , rich s @xcite .",
    "experience on this technology came from the participation of jrgen engelfried on the design , construction , operation , and analysis of two previous rich s , one in wa89 and another in selex .",
    "also , in selex , ricardo lpez fernndez , graduate student from if - uaslp , worked on and used the rich as part of his m.sc .",
    "thesis .",
    "ckm marks the near future experimental enterprise we are working on at if - uaslp .",
    "we are initiating high energy physics instrumentation at if - uaslp , aimed right now at the rich technology applied to the ckm experiment .",
    "experimental high energy physics evolves with projects and this aspect is also reflected on the if - uaslp group which has seen the pass of experiments e761 , wa89 , e781 and now ckm .",
    "presently , the group is creating a high energy instrumentation laboratory towards detector research and development .",
    "the basic idea of the laboratory is to target user defined detectors at world wide experiments , right now we have the rich design and testing for ckm . in 1999 ,",
    "if - uaslp just hired ruben flores mendieta to strength particle physics theory and phenomenology research . looking backwards from the beginning of the 80 s to the end of the 90 s",
    "a spawn of close to 20 years has happened for initiating an experimental group at san luis potos , that is a positive result from an initial kick .",
    "this work was partly financed by if - uaslp and conacyt .",
