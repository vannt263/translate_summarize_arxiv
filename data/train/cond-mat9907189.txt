    "many unusual aspects of the unconventional superconductivity in the cuprate and heavy fermion materials are related to the existence of nodes in the energy gap .",
    "although intensely discussed in the 1980s and 1990s , most of these phenomena were already known much earlier to students of the unconventional superfluid @xmath4he , which exhibits several phases , some with gap nodes and accompanying low - energy fermionic excitations .",
    "for example , power laws in specific heat , transport properties , and nmr were predicted and measured in the anisotropic , high - pressure `` a '' phase , along with singular responses to impurities , unusual vortex phases , and even anomalous josephson currents @xcite . from this perspective , the one important difference between the new superconductors and the @xmath4he system is that they are charged ; unconventional superconductivity can be uniquely probed by studying the response of the system to an applied electromagnetic field . .2",
    "cm even the simplest such phenomenon , the expulsion of a weak applied magnetic field , or meissner effect , is still the subject of intense discussion today in the context of unconventional superconductivity .",
    "the new materials are strong type - ii superconductors , with large values of the london penetration depth @xmath5 and small coherence lengths @xmath6 , such that the condition @xmath7 is expected to hold .",
    "it was therefore anticipated in the earliest theories of the meissner effect in unconventional superconductors@xcite that the electrodynamics of the system could be treated as _",
    "local _ , i.e. , as though the cooper pairs were point objects , neglecting the spatial variation of the electromagnetic wave over the extent of the pair . under this rather plausible assumption ,",
    "the simple anisotropic extension of the bcs theory is expected to hold , @xmath8 where the quasiparticle spectrum is @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the normal - state electron band , @xmath11 is the momentum - dependent order parameter , @xmath12 is the fermi function , @xmath13 is the direction of the supercurrent , and @xmath14 represents a fermi surface average . the london penetration depth at @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 , and is typically one to several thousand angstrm in the new materials .",
    ".2 cm at low temperatures , the local penetration depth calculated from eq .",
    "( 1 ) may be shown@xcite to vary as a power law of temperature , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the gap maximum and the exponent @xmath19 depends on dimensionality , nodal topology , and the rate at which the gap goes to zero near a nodal wave vector @xmath20 . for line nodes in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) system ( or point nodes in a 2d system ) like the @xmath21 state thought to characterize the cuprate superconductors , @xmath19 is found to be 1 .",
    "thus when hardy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured a linear temperature dependence in the yba@xmath22cu@xmath23o@xmath24 ( ybco ) system down to a few degrees k , it was dramatic evidence in favor of line order parameter nodes and possible unconventional pairing .",
    ".2 cm recently , kosztin and leggett@xcite questioned the theoretical basis for this identification , pointing out that the approximation of local electrodynamics used to derive eq .",
    "( 1 ) is not valid for the quasiparticle states near the nodes whose occupation determines the asymptotic low - temperature behavior .",
    "the coherence length @xmath25 determines the scale of order - parameter variations , as in the usual bcs theory , but an effective coherence length @xmath26 appears in the electromagnetic response , as noted in ref .",
    "the divergence of @xmath27 at the nodes means that quasiparticle states near the nodes must always be treated nonlocally @xcite .",
    "a full nonlocal calculation gives a crossover from a @xmath28 regime for @xmath29 to a @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "in the ybco system , this crossover scale @xmath32 is about 1 k , and thus the identification of the @xmath0-wave state on the basis of the local theory is not really in question ; measurements on the purest ybco crystals down to 1 k or so have seen no deviation from the linear behavior .",
    "@xcite quadratic dependences @xmath30 measured in some samples are more likely due to impurity effects @xcite , which also produce a @xmath33 crossover .",
    ".2 cm an interesting perspective on the question of the linear @xmath2 dependence of the penetration depth was provided recently by schopohl and dolgov @xcite , who observed that _",
    "if _ the @xmath0-wave penetration depth temperature dependence were to remain linear down to @xmath15 , one would be unable to satisfy the third law of thermodynamics ( nernst s theorem ) . in the framework of linear - response theory",
    ", they expressed the change of the free energy in the presence of the magnetic field ( for fixed external current source ) as a functional of the penetration depth , @xmath34 |\\a_\\q(t)|^2 , \\label{fesd }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the fourier component of the magnetic vector potential .",
    "the resulting entropy is @xmath36 |\\a_\\q(t)|^2 .",
    "\\label{entropysd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the nernst theorem requires @xmath37 to be 0 when @xmath38 , inconsistent with @xmath39 .",
    ".2 cm schopohl and dolgov speculated that this result might imply the instability of a pure @xmath0-wave state within bcs theory at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , that the extra magnetic - field - induced quasiparticles that deplete the shielding current , leading to a magnetic - field - dependent penetration depth known as the nonlinear meissner effect @xcite , were neglected in this analysis .",
    "several authors have recently considered the effects of these nonlinear terms in the supercurrent on transverse magnetization measurements@xcite and on the structure of the vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that , like impurity effects , the magnetic field itself may serve as a cooper pair breaker that creates nodal quasiparticles , leading to a temperature dependent penetration depth @xmath40 at temperatures below the scale for nonlinear electrodynamics , @xmath41 with @xmath1 a typical supercurrent velocity and @xmath42 the fermi wave vector .",
    "the current authors@xcite then provided a synthesis of the various arguments given above , pointing out that for any experimental geometry with given disorder , external current distribution , and ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath43 , a sample of @xmath0-wave superconductor would inevitably avoid the violation of the nernst theorem by creating a @xmath44 term in its penetration depth through a competition of nonlinear , nonlocal , and impurity effects .",
    ".2 cm although this issue of principle has been resolved , an important prediction of the @xmath0-wave model for the electrodynamics of high-@xmath45 superconductors ( hts ) has not yet been confirmed . in the early discussion of the symmetry of the hts order parameter",
    ", yip and sauls proposed that the angular position of the gap nodes could be probed by a measurement of the magnetic field dependence of the penetration depth . in the local limit and for @xmath38 , they predicted that the nonlinear effect induces a _ linear_-@xmath3 term in the penetration depth , @xmath46 where @xmath3 is the applied magnetic field at the surface and @xmath47 is of order the thermodynamic critical field of the system with @xmath48 the flux quantum .",
    "the prefactor of the linear @xmath3 term in eq .",
    "( [ pdys ] ) depends generally on the angle @xmath49 that the supercurrent makes with the crystalline @xmath50 axis and is independent of @xmath2 ( the @xmath2 dependence appears in the @xmath51 term as discussed recently by dahm and scalapino @xcite ) .",
    "several experimental groups tried to verify the prediction of yip and sauls , but failed to identify a linear @xmath3 term which scaled with the temperature according to the theory@xcite .",
    "there are three relevant energy scales in the low - energy sector in the meissner state , @xmath2 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the first two are experimentally controlled parameters while the last is an intrinsic one .",
    "obviously , @xmath39 behavior should be expected at @xmath54 .",
    "but in the opposite limit , i.e. , at extremely low @xmath2 , either nonlinear or nonlocal effects may play a crucial role in modifying the linear @xmath2 behavior .",
    "thus a full study including both nonlinear and nonlocal effects in the meissner state is necessary .",
    "a similar investigation has been performed by amin , affleck , and franz @xcite in the mixed state where @xmath55 , the lower critical field .",
    "it was found in this numerical study that the nonlinear and nonlocal corrections were of the same order .",
    "this result is not surprising : in the mixed state the nonlinear energy scale and the nonlocal one are not independent , since typical spatial variations take place on a scale of the magnetic length or intervortex distance , fixed by the fluxoid quantization .    in this paper , we perform a full study of a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0-wave superconductor in the presence of a weak magnetic field .",
    "we start from a phenomenological bcs hamiltonian with a quasiparticle energy spectrum in the normal state , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the chemical potential ) and a @xmath21-wave order parameter , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is the angle of @xmath60 with the @xmath50 axis ) . using the functional - integral approach , we calculate the free energy and compare it with that obtained in other theories .",
    "our main approximation is that the supercurrent along the surface boundary is a slowly varying function of the distance to the surface .",
    "thus we take @xmath61 as the supercurrent to which the quasiparticles couple , leading to the doppler shift in the energy spectrum of particles and holes @xmath62 , where @xmath63^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the response of the quasiparticles to the @xmath64 modes is treated perturbatively , and the resulting response function involves both the nonlinear and nonlocal effects . from this response function",
    "we then calculate the penetration depth , and express it as a scaling function of the two parameters @xmath65 .",
    "we show explicitly that , below a temperature @xmath66 , the linear @xmath2 behavior of the penetration depth is always modified by either nonlinear or nonlocal effects to a quadratic function of @xmath2 , while the linear @xmath3 behavior in the penetration depth is also cut off by the nonlocal effects when @xmath3 is below some characteristic critical field @xmath67 , which is geometry dependent . for most geometries",
    "@xmath68 , implying the unobservability of the nonlinear meissner effect , as discussed in our recent paper on this subject @xcite .",
    "but for some special geometries , in which the supercurrent is along nodal directions , the nonlinear meissner effect may be recovered .",
    "we also present a brief discussion on the geometry in which the magnetic field is along the conduction plane , which presents some special features due to the highly layered nature of the cuprates .",
    "finally , we investigate the consequence of the spatially varying nature of the supercurrent and find that this property does not influence the qualitative behavior of the penetration depth .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the model hamiltonian and the partition function are obtained . in sec .",
    "iii , the expression of the free energy as well as its comparison with various theories in several limiting cases is presented , and the supercurrent and the response function are discussed .",
    "detailed study of the penetration depth in the presence of a constant @xmath1 is given in sec .",
    "section v is devoted to concluding remarks and comparison with existing experiments .",
    "finally , a discussion of the renormalization of the penetration depth due to space - dependent @xmath1 is included in the appendix .",
