    "the baryon resonances present a peculiar conundrum in the context of qcd . on one hand ,",
    "the resonances are continuum effects , often manifesting themselves as little more than a subtle disturbance in an otherwise smooth argand diagram for a process such as meson - baryon scattering or photoproduction . on the other hand",
    ", they are states with more or less well - defined masses , are numerous , and occur with a regularity that suggests a spectrum delineated by multiplets of some underlying symmetry structure  @xcite .    a growing series of papers  @xcite has developed a field theory - based approach in which to tackle the challenging problem of studying these states and the scattering amplitudes in which they appear .",
    "short reviews of this literature appear in refs .",
    "the central idea rests upon symmetries that emerge for qcd in the large @xmath1 limit , and that relate the scattering amplitudes in channels of different @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and other quantum numbers .",
    "the original motivation dates back to a number of papers from the 1980s that developed the group - theoretical consequences of the skyrme and other chiral soliton models  @xcite .",
    "as one can show , the leading - order amplitudes in the @xmath0 expansion , expressed in terms of @xmath9-channel quantum numbers , have @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this is a direct result  @xcite of unitarity in the large @xmath1 limit  @xcite and holds for 3-flavor as well as 2-flavor processes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the result can be extended to finite-@xmath1 processes : amplitudes with @xmath11 are suppressed by at least @xmath12 compared to the leading order  @xcite .",
    "the consequence is a systematic expansion in @xmath0 that can be applied to any process involving scattering with a stable ( ground - state ) baryon state , and like for any other effective theory , a number of results hold at the lowest order in the expansion that receive corrections from higher - order effects . in the present case ,",
    "linear relations arise among the scattering amplitudes in different channels , imposing degeneracies among poles ( representing resonance masses and widths ) that occur within them .",
    "our focus here is to press beyond the baryon - plus - single meson final state processes that were considered exclusively in all the previous papers in this series . a quick glance at the voluminous listings for baryon resonances in the _ review of particle physics _ by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite reminds even the casual reader that baryon resonances are common features in processes with multiple final - state pions .",
    "we speak here exclusively of nonstrange processes purely as a matter of convenience ; the 3-flavor formalism is more cumbersome but is nevertheless tractable  @xcite .",
    "however , since the @xmath0 scattering formalism depends upon a single incoming source and a single outgoing source scattering from the baryon , one must employ additional considerations to find a meaningful way to constrain such multipion processes .",
    "in particular , standard @xmath1 counting shows that the generic scattering amplitude for @xmath13 is @xmath14 , while that for @xmath15 [ fig .",
    "[ scatfigs](a ) ] is @xmath16 .",
    "this figure represents one of the six diagrams for this processes , when all permutations of the @xmath17-baryon vertices with respect to the external @xmath17 states are counted ; indeed , when the intermediate baryon lines belong to the ground - state multiplet ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , cancellations between the @xmath17-baryon couplings , which depend upon the existence of this degenerate multiplet of baryon states , are necessary to obtain the @xmath16 scaling of the full amplitude  @xcite .    1.8 in 1.8 in 1.8 in    nevertheless",
    ", circumstances exist in which processes that _ eventually _ produce two ( or more ) pions nevertheless appear with amplitudes at leading order , @xmath14 . as suggested above and to be elucidated further in the next section , the @xmath20 is stable for sufficiently large @xmath1 ; its width scales as @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , as in fig .",
    "[ scatfigs](b ) , the @xmath22 process may be cut ( indicating an on - shell state ) at the intermediate stage , @xmath23 . of course",
    ", we live in the @xmath24 world where @xmath25 is over 100  mev ; even so , @xmath25 is considered sufficiently small ( relative to its mass ) that researchers regularly extract @xmath23 partial widths , and the pdg sees fit to tabulate them .",
    "in such cases , the single source - plus - baryon scattering formalism discussed above may be utilized .",
    "similarly , standard large @xmath1 counting shows all meson widths to be @xmath26 ; in particular , the first stage of a @xmath27 process such as in fig .",
    "[ scatfigs](c ) that is found to be dominated by an on - shell meson resonance ( @xmath28 followed by @xmath29 ) is also @xmath14 .",
    "again , one may analyze such processes using the original two - body formalism since @xmath30 partial widths have been tabulated . as long as one is confident that the analyzed process contains a two - body resonant intermediate state , which is tantamount to having confidence that the continuum background of fig .",
    "[ scatfigs](a ) is correctly subtracted from the full experimentally measured @xmath31 scattering amplitude , then the separation between fig .",
    "[ scatfigs](a ) and ( b),(c ) processes is clean .",
    "this applies not only to the leading - order amplitudes , but to the @xmath0 subleading corrections in each case .    in this paper",
    "we tabulate all @xmath32 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath33 , @xmath2 , and @xmath34 scattering amplitudes at leading order using the large @xmath1 scattering formalism , for all channels up to spin-5/2 for either parity @xmath35 .",
    "( likewise , @xmath36 and @xmath37 could easily be tabulated , but the thresholds for these states are about @xmath38  gev , where baryon resonance data becomes less abundant . ) the @xmath6 final - state results of course represent elastic scattering , and have been tabulated in the original papers  @xcite , as have been unmixed ( no change in relative orbital angular momentum ) @xmath3 amplitudes .",
    "the older papers also presented results for the illustrative but unphysical case of @xmath39 scattering .",
    "we also note that previous papers using the @xmath0 expansion  @xcite present numerical results for excited baryons decaying into @xmath4 and @xmath40 final states , but the assumptions required for these analyses is rather different from ours , and we defer a direct comparison to the conclusions .",
    "our approach is fraught with difficulties , both at the theoretical and practical levels .",
    "first , we do not explicitly include the @xmath0 corrections in the tabulated results .",
    "while the previous papers have shown how to carry out this procedure  @xcite , presenting all the explicit results here would make already complicated tables positively impenetrable .",
    "nevertheless , to illustrate our points about the importance of @xmath0 corrections , we demonstrate in one specific case ( @xmath41 positive-@xmath42 resonances ) the effect of these @xmath0 corrections .",
    "second , the mesons considered differ widely in mass , from 140  mev @xmath17 to the 783  mev @xmath43 .",
    "we take into account differences in phase space when making numerical comparisons , simply by using the standard two - body formula ( eqs .",
    "( 38.16)(38.17 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) for @xmath44 .",
    "even so , the mesons fall into two entirely different categories : the @xmath17 and @xmath45 are pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , while the @xmath46 and @xmath43 are vector mesons whose masses are set by the qcd scale .",
    "chiral symmetry has not been imposed anywhere in this formalism ( although combining this approach and chiral symmetry has yielded some rather interesting results  @xcite ) , and likely produce interesting physical effects beyond those considered here .",
    "third , the data set , while quite extensive , is filled with internal contradictions between one given partial - wave analysis and the next ; and even when the analyses agree , the uncertainties extracted are often as large as the effects themselves .",
    "this fact was an additional motivating factor for us not to attempt to tabulate all the @xmath47 corrections : our opinion is that such a global analysis of all baryon resonance observables based upon the large set of amplitudes appearing at @xmath14 and @xmath47 should be carried out by the experts of partial - wave analysis themselves , who have access to the raw data and understand the many systematic and correlated uncertainties in the experimental measurements .",
    "here we are mainly interested in identifying the underlying pole structure of the system of nonstrange baryon resonances ( classified according to the underlying symmetry provided by large @xmath1 ) , as identified  for reasons to be discussed below  by the presence or absence of certain decay channels ( primarily those containing an @xmath45 or a mixed partial - wave @xmath5 final state ) .",
    "we also find that , once identified , the pole - containing amplitudes alone do not provide robust numerical results for the relative branching ratios ( br s ) at @xmath14 ; including @xmath47 corrections has a dramatic effect upon the numerical predictions , and their inclusion appears to be essential to obtain an accurate rendering of the data .",
    "we shall use a well - defined field theoretical expansion to peer into one of the murkiest corners of qcd , and reveal both the successes and limitations of the method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ group ] we present the explicit expressions used to derive the leading - order [ @xmath14 ] scattering amplitudes for all meson - baryon to meson - baryon scattering amplitudes . in sec",

    "section  [ phenom ] presents an analysis , channel by channel , of results from comparing existing resonance data to our results and consider the evidence for resonant multiplets . in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we present a brief discussion ( including a comparison to related previous large @xmath1 work ) and conclude .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the linear expressions describing meson - baryon scattering amplitudes and degeneracies among the baryonic resonances embedded within them .",
    "the formalism from which they are derived  @xcite is obtained from considering only initial- and final - state baryons lying in the ground - state band of large @xmath1 , which is the completely symmetric spin - flavor representation generalizing the * 56 * of su(6 ) , and whose nonstrange members have spin = isospin @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath20 is therefore , like the nucleon , a stable baryon in the large @xmath1 limit [ @xmath51 and decays in the case of @xmath52 only because the chiral limit is approached more quickly than the large @xmath1 limit : @xmath53 .",
    "but the restriction of baryons to this multiplet is not physically constraining , since all observed meson - baryon scattering processes fit into this category .",
    "this analysis can in principle be carried out for baryons ( in the ground - state multiplet ) and mesons of arbitrary spin , isospin , and strangeness quantum numbers , although in the context of this paper we examine only processes created by @xmath6 scattering , and restrict the final states to consist of nonstrange mesons and baryons .",
    "the basic process is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a meson of spin @xmath56 and isospin @xmath57 , in a state of relative orbital angular momentum @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) with a baryon @xmath60 of spin = isospin @xmath61 in the ground - state multiplet , and the total spin angular momentum ( not including relative orbital angular momentum ) of the meson and baryon is denoted @xmath62 .",

    ", one of the @xmath80 amplitudes must contain the pole .",
    "however , since the @xmath97 amplitudes each contribute to multiple partial waves , all of these channels must have resonances at the same position , which means that the masses and widths of certain resonances in different partial waves must be degenerate . moreover , while the amplitudes themselves , as functions of energy , carry dependence on the orbital angular momenta @xmath58 , @xmath59 and the auxiliary variables @xmath69 , @xmath70 , the resonances themselves ( once formed ) have no memory of the process used to create them .",

    "the following is our analysis for each channel .",
    "1 .   @xmath127 : the two well - established resonances in this channel are @xmath128 ( the roper ) and @xmath129 . in comparison ,",
    "our transition amplitude calculations provide two distinct pole structures , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "the roper breit - wigner mass does in fact lie slightly below the @xmath4 threshold ( 1485  mev ) , but it is also a very broad state ( @xmath134 perhaps as large as 450  mev ) , making the total absence of an @xmath4 final state noteworthy ; indeed , some partial - wave analyses find the even more kinematically suppressed @xmath2 final state to occur at the level of several percent .",
    "comparing this observation to our tabulated result for the @xmath135 transition amplitude suggests that the roper is a @xmath136 pole and the @xmath129 is a @xmath131 pole .",
    "this assignment also agrees very well with the assumption of the roper as a radial excitation of ground - state @xmath18 , which is a ( nonresonant ) @xmath137 state .",
    "unfortunately , the leading - order prediction of @xmath138 to @xmath23 br s with this assignment does not agree well with experiment .",

    "the same is true for the @xmath129 resonance but in the opposite fashion : the leading - order prediction for the ratio of @xmath32 to @xmath143 br for this resonance is @xmath144 , but the experimental value is @xmath145 . as mentioned above , this discrepancy can be cured by 1/@xmath1-suppressed amplitudes . to demonstrate this",

    "too many amplitudes appear in the each of the @xmath2 channels ( 3055@xmath218 total br ) to make any useful predictions .",
    "@xmath274 : the only prominent resonance in this channel is @xmath275 . unfortunately there is not sufficient experimental data to perform any meaningful analysis for this state ; indeed , although the @xmath32 br is listed as only 515@xmath218 , one old analysis listed in the pdg states that no @xmath276 final state was seen . in light of the complicated reduced amplitude structure for the @xmath277 , a determination of the pole assignment of this resonance would require a measurement of either the @xmath33 or @xmath278 @xmath5 br .    the summary of our analysis is the pole assignments for the following resonances : @xmath130 are @xmath128 @xmath279 and @xmath197 @xmath280 ; @xmath131 are @xmath129 @xmath279 , @xmath281 @xmath282 , @xmath198 @xmath280 , @xmath211 @xmath223 , and @xmath260 @xmath283 ; @xmath168 are @xmath181 @xmath192 and @xmath284 @xmath285 .",
    "taking into account that the two values of @xmath42 ( @xmath172 and @xmath179 waves for @xmath286 , @xmath78 and @xmath287 waves for @xmath288 ) give separate multiplet structures , one concludes that @xmath129 and @xmath281 belong to a single @xmath289 multiplet , as do @xmath198 , @xmath211 , and @xmath260 ( @xmath290 ) , and @xmath181 and @xmath284 ( @xmath291 ) . by the same token",
    ", @xmath128 is a @xmath292 and @xmath197 is a @xmath293 .",
    "do the data support these as degenerate multiplets ? certainly the masses are consistent ; the natural size of the mass splitting within a degenerate multiplet is relatively @xmath294 compared to the common @xmath295  gev baryon mass , of order 110  mev or larger . as demonstrated some time ago  @xcite , even the @xmath20-@xmath18 mass difference @xmath296  mev is of a natural size in this sense . on the other hand ,",
    "the range of well - known baryon resonances is remarkably small : only from about 1.4 to 2.0  gev .",
    "the masses in our proposed multiplets certainly pass this criterion .",
    "there is also some evidence from the widths , which are @xmath14 and , if two resonances are in a multiplet , should be equal to about 1 part in 3 . for the proposed @xmath297 multiplet they are 50250 and 200400  mev , respectively ; for the @xmath298 they are 145185 , 100125 , and 135150  mev , respectively ; and for the @xmath299 multiplet they are 120140 and 270400  mev",
    ". only the last of these should warrant attention as a possible problem , and even in this case the large difference in width may simply be attributable to the large number of final - state channels that open between 1680 and 1905  mev .    those resonances for which we conclude pole assignments are not unambiguous ( but could be made so by observing @xmath45 final states or @xmath5 mixed partial waves ) are @xmath228 @xmath300 ( @xmath301 or 3 ) , @xmath212 @xmath223 ( @xmath131 or 2 ) , @xmath161 @xmath302 ( @xmath131 or 2 ) , @xmath246 and @xmath303 @xmath282 ( @xmath304 , or 2 ) , @xmath240 @xmath305 ( @xmath131 or 2 ) , and @xmath306 @xmath307 ( @xmath308 , or 3 ) . while this level of ambiguity may be bothersome",
    ", we hasten to point out the multitude of opportunities for tests .",
    "for example , the @xmath309 pole appears in no less than 28 of our observable partial waves .",
    "as should be clear from this analysis , the constraints provided by the @xmath0 expansion seem reliable in most cases for predicting the identity of a resonant pole ; the states with a final @xmath45 and the mixed partial - wave @xmath5 final states , each being sensitive to a single @xmath68 amplitude , make this possible .",
    "( it should be added that the @xmath310 mixed partial - wave amplitudes , if they are ever measured , share this property . )",
    "however , the particular coupling ratios given at leading order by the group - theoretical constraints of the @xmath0 expansion do not fare as well , even when phase space corrections are included .",
    "we have referred several times to the need for including @xmath0 corrections in order to explain these large discrepancies with data , and in the first example ( @xmath167 ) presented the explicit expressions for the @xmath0-suppressed amplitudes to show that corrections of the required size are in fact possible .",
    "however , the true measure of whether the @xmath0 expansion is in genuine agreement with the full data set would require a global fit to the multitude of physical scattering amplitudes , many of which are poorly determined or have never been determined at all .    in comparison , the older works of refs .",
    "@xcite employ specific operators at both leading and subleading orders in @xmath0 , to consider @xmath4 and @xmath40 final states , their starting point being well - defined spin - flavor multiplets such as [ su(6),@xmath311 = ( * 70 * , @xmath298 ) . as discussed in great detail starting in refs .",
    "@xcite , this `` operator '' or `` hamiltonian '' approach is absolutely legitimate when either the baryons are stable against strong decays or are comprised of heavy valence quarks , in which case the eigenstates of a hamiltonian consisting of operators with well - defined spin - flavor transformation properties are the asymptotically free states of the theory .",
    "indeed , such analyses were patterned after works such as refs .",
    "@xcite and were introduced for the excited baryons in refs .",
    "it is not clear in this strict approach , however , that substantial baryon resonance widths or configuration mixing between distinct spin - flavor multiplets can be accommodated , which is why the present `` scattering '' approach was developed .",
    "the old spin - flavor multiplets of su(6)@xmath312o(3 ) were shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be compatible with the scattering approach , meaning that they form reducible collections of the true large @xmath1 irreducible degenerate resonance multiplets .",
    "the numerical results of refs .",
    "@xcite are certainly have smaller stated uncertainties than the ones in this work ( ours being presented only at leading order in @xmath1 ) , but this reflects the fact that their formalism is more limited by considering only particular spin - flavor multiplets , which are effectively assumed to be narrow in width and unmixed with other states . as mentioned above , it is possible in principle to perform a global analysis of all baryon resonances in our formalism , including @xmath0 corrections . finally , we point out that the older works did not consider final - state vector mesons .    in the context of our formalism",
    ", how might a violation of the @xmath0 expansion manifest itself ?",
    "let us suppose that the analysis of the data , including the large data set being collected at jefferson lab , extracts branching ratios with smaller uncertainties for all the expected partial waves .",
    "a large branching ratio for a given resonance into both the @xmath45 and mixed partial - wave @xmath5 final state , corresponding to two distinct values of @xmath68 , would be problematic for this program .",
    "alternately , a partial wave that gives no signal of a pole determined through other channels but nevertheless contains the requisite reduced amplitudes [ for example , if a prominent pole seen in @xmath313 , giving @xmath314 , did not appear in @xmath315 would spell trouble for the approach .",
    "finally , a global fit of the sort described above , in which some of the reduced amplitudes turned out to be substantially larger than unity , would indicate a problem .    as we discussed in the introduction",
