    "the long - distance color - dependent forces among quarks and gluons are the key quantities for the understanding of the internal structure of hadron as well as color confinement dynamics .",
    "the quarks and gluons are described in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and have a color charge based on the su(3 ) group , with which the quark combination yields many color - dependent forces including both attractive and repulsive forces .",
    "they make the hadron structure ( quark bound state ) more complicated .",
    "therefore , it is essential to know the basic behavior of the color - dependent force at short and large distances",
    ".    the color - dependent force will be important when one investigates the multiquark hadron ( made of more than four quarks ) and the exotic meson , etc .",
    "although many candidates of those particles have been recently reported by experimental groups @xcite , it is still a hard task to theoretically understand those new particles .",
    "they may consist of many quarks with various color - dependent forces that make their internal structure more complicated than the existing baryons .",
    "the quark interaction at short distances can be characterized by a coefficient @xmath0 of a one - gluon exchange potential .",
    "this is a basic assumption if we construct a quark model to deal with the baryon system .",
    "however , owing to the quark confinement , it is not obvious how quarks behave for large quark separation .",
    "we thus need a lattice simulation to obtain a nonperturbative feature for the long - range color - dependent force .    however , the lattice study along this line is sparse , although there are many lattice studies about the @xmath1 potential @xcite obtained by the gauge - invariant wilson - loop operator .",
    "this operator mixes color - singlet with color - octet contributions ; therefore , we can not separately extract the color - octet potential from the wilson loop . in spite of this",
    ", the color - octet process has been discussed in the detailed analysis of the @xmath2 photoproduction to explain the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions @xcite . on the other hand , there is no lattice calculation for @xmath3 sector as well ; however , the diquark ( color-@xmath4 @xmath3 ) is also an important ingredient on hadron physics .",
    "the existence of the diquark has been believed by many physicists and applied to work out unsolved problems @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath3 potential in the lattice theory is not formulated gauge - invariantly .    in this study , we employ a color - dependent polyakov line correlator ( plc ) with the coulomb gauge fixing in order to clarify the color - dependent forces @xcite . in the quark - gluon plasma phase ,",
    "there have been already some numerical studies of the color - screened color - dependent force with the coulomb and landau gauge fixings @xcite .",
    "investigating the confining color - dependent forces we use coulomb gauge qcd @xcite , theoretical background of which has been recently studied well @xcite .",
    "in this theory , the plc potential can be separated into the vacuum polarization part and the color - coulomb instantaneous part ; the latter relatively produces us a clear numerical signal even in the confinement phase @xcite .",
    "the color - coulomb instantaneous potential is not the same as the wilson - loop potential .",
    "however , it yields an upper bound of a linearly - rising quark potential @xcite and is the most important quantity on the coulomb gauge confinement scenario @xcite .",
    "the infrared singularity of this potential is caused from accumulation of the faddeev - popov ( fp ) ghost eigenvalue at the vanishing momentum @xcite .",
    "coulomb gauge qcd may provide us the most favorable framework when one considers the hadron phenomenological studies such as a constituent quark model .",
    "the coulomb gauge as a physical gauge gives a positive - definite fock space that is suitable for constructing effective hamiltonians .",
    "moreover , the color - coulomb instantaneous potential without the vacuum polarization ( or a retarded effect ) is required to make a quark bound state in analogy with the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "this formulation is applicable in the heavy - quark system with no retarded effect as well as in the light - quark system with the constituent quarks due to chiral - symmetry breaking @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the long - distance divergence behavior of the color - dependent forces . because the color - nonsinglet state can not exist in nature",
    ", singularities in such states will emerge on the lattice as a finite - volume effect .",
    "this has not been verified in the previous calculation [ 13 ] , and thus we should investigate their divergence behavior on a variety of lattice sizes .",
    "we also discuss the color - factor dependence for the degree of the divergence and will confirm this point by the numerical lattice simulation . in section",
    "ii , we briefly summarize coulomb gauge qcd and the definition of the color - dependent potentials with the plcs . in section iii , we give lattice numerical results and fitting analyses .",
    "section iv is devoted to our summary .",
    "coulomb gauge qcd has been quantized through the faddeev - popov technique @xcite and renormalizability of this theory has been also proved in terms of the hamiltonian and lagrangian formalism @xcite . the use of the coulomb gauge as a physical gauge leads us to classify transverse gluon modes and an instantaneous interaction , which is required to make quark bound states in analogy with qed .",
    "the hamiltonian of qcd in the coulomb gauge can be given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the transverse electric field , the transverse magnetic field and the color - charge density , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath9 in the second term is made by the faddeev - popov ( fp ) operator in the spatial direction , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",

    "( [ part ] ) , one can evaluate the time - time gluon propagator composed of the following two parts : @xmath12 where @xmath13 equation ( [ vi ] ) is the instantaneous color - coulomb potential at equal time and causes antiscreening , so that this potential should be a confining potential to attract quarks in hadrons and is the most important quantity on the coulomb gauge confinement scenario .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) in the case of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) as a nonconfining theory is identified as a coulomb propagator @xmath14 or a coulomb potential @xmath15 .",
    "simultaneously , eq . ( [ d00 ] ) stands for a vacuum polarization , @xmath16 which brings about color - screening effect owing to the negative sign , producing the reduction of a color - confining force .",
    "note that this term is associated with a quark - pair creation from vacuum when dynamical quarks exist .",
    "consequently , we can consider that the instantaneous interaction is somewhat more classical than the time - dependent vacuum part .",
    "one can define the color - dependent potentials on a lattice with the polyakov line ( pl ) correlators@xcite . in this study",
    "we separate the original potential obtained from the pl correlators into the color - coulomb instantaneous and color vacuum polarization ( retarded ) parts with the coulomb gauge fixing .",
    "moreover , the color - coulomb potential defined by the link - link correlator as will be described below gives clear signals into practical numerical calculation even in the quenched lattice simulations .",

    "( [ pot1 ] ) and ( [ pot2 ] ) we obtain the color - dependent potentials in each color channel .",
    "the above four potentials are classified in terms of the color ( the quadratic casimir ) factor on color @xmath19 group in the fundamental representation : @xmath40 for color - singlet , color - octet , color - triplet and color - sextet channels , respectively .",
    "these coefficients appear as the proportional constant of the one - gluon exchange potential . and",
    "@xmath3 sectors in relation to a so - called @xmath0 quark model . therefore , in this study , we do not calculate the gauge - invariant wilson - loop potentials in higher representations for @xmath1 sector as introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite ]      since the color - dependent potentials defined by the ppl correlators are not gauge invariant , we have to fix a gauge .",
    "we use the coulomb gauge realized on a lattice as @xmath41 by repeating the following gauge rotations : @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 is a gauge rotation matrix , where the parameter @xmath45 is chosen suitably depending on the lattice size , etc . ] and @xmath46 are spatial lattice link variables .",
    "the thermalized lattice configuration can be gauge fixed iteratively @xcite .    because the coulomb gauge fixing does not fully fix a gauge",
    "one can still perform a time - dependent gauge rotation on the coulomb - gauge fixed links , @xmath47 thereby , @xmath48 and @xmath49 constructed by ppl are not invariant under this transformation eq .",
    "( [ gt ] ) .",
    "accordingly , when performing numerical simulations for the octet and two @xmath3 correlators with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we should additionally implement a global temporal - gauge fixing on the coulomb - gauge fixed links as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a spatial lattice volume .",
    "note that this gauge fixing does not affect an intrinsic coulomb gauge feature .",
    "in coulomb gauge qcd , we find that infrared divergences cancel only for color - singlet interactions .",
    "let us write the color - charge density for two - quark system as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the generators of the color-@xmath19 group .",
    "the instantaneous potential with @xmath54 ( eq . ( [ instinteraction ] ) ) is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the expectation value of the faddeev - popov operator and @xmath57 means the deviations of the factorization , e.g. , @xmath58 if there is no quantum correction ; this argument has been done in refs .",

    "@xmath59 is reduced to each color factor that appeared in eq .",

    "the self - energy interaction not depending on the distance @xmath25 is written as @xmath60 where the casimir invariant @xmath61 in the fundamental representation of the @xmath19 group .",
    "the infrared ( not ultraviolet ) divergence emerges in both eps .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) and ( [ self2 ] ) .",
    "if the term @xmath62 behaves as @xmath63 that would be responsible for the linear confinement @xmath64 , as has been analyzed in the refs .",
    "@xcite , then the infrared singularities unrelated to the linear potential arise from two terms : @xmath65 consequently , they are completely cancelled in the case of the color - singlet representation since @xmath66 . meanwhile ,",
    "the other cases are proportional to the following factors : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 for @xmath70 , @xmath4 and @xmath71 , respectively , implying that the color - sextet channel may diverge most strongly .",
    "we carry out @xmath19 lattice gauge simulations in the quenched approximation to calculate the color - decomposed ppl correlators .",
    "the lattice update is done by the heat - bath monte carlo algorithm with a plaquette wilson gauge action .",
    "the lattice configuration numbers for the @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 lattices are 600 , 700 and 320 ; additionally , in order to investigate the volume dependence , we added the @xmath75 and @xmath76 lattices with @xmath77 configurations .",
    "the lattice coupling constant @xmath78 for all the lattices is fixed to @xmath79 corresponding to the lattice cutoff @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "figure [ 4pots ] shows numerical results for the color - coulomb instantaneous potential @xmath30 , in the color - singlet , color - octet , color - sextet , color - triplet ( antisymmetric ) channels .",
    "we find that both the color - singlet @xmath81 and color - antitriplet @xmath82 yield attractions at all distances , and in particular , are linearly rising potential at large distances . on the other hand ,",
    "the color - octet @xmath83 and color - sextet @xmath84 potentials are repulsive forces although the variation of those potentials on distances is small .    in order to investigate the magnitude of the string tensions , we calculate an effective string tension for the color - singlet and color - antitriplet channels .",
    "the confining potential can be described by the function @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a self - energy constant term , k corresponds to the string tension , and the last term is the coulomb term . here",
    "the effective string tension is defined as @xmath87 in lattice units , which should be a constant for large quark separations if it is a confining potential with a finite string tension . in fig . [ effstring ]",
    "we find that the ks become stable over approximately @xmath88 as the lattice size increases .",
    "when we use the data for @xmath89 ( @xmath90 for the @xmath72 lattice ) , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ ratios ] the ratio @xmath91 , which is found to be close to @xmath92 ; for example , we obtain the @xmath93 and @xmath94 from the @xmath73 lattice .",
    "note that our definition of the color - coulomb instantaneous part on a lattice in terms of the ppl correlator ( eq .",
    "( [ pot2 ] ) ) does not completely exclude a vacuum polarization effect .    for the color - octet and sextet channels it is hard to discuss a precise value of both string tensions under the present statistical accuracy .",
    "in practice , from @xmath73 lattice data and under the fitting range @xmath95 , we obtain the octet string tension @xmath96 and the sextet string tension @xmath97 although the volume dependence does not appear large as shown in fig .",
    "this indicates that the long - range behavior of the octet and sextet channels is quantitatively a minor contribution to two - quark system .",
    "however , in order to work out more quantitative measurement for the repulsive channels ( and also the attractive channels ) , one may need enough statistics on a larger lattice .",
    "here we consider the infrared divergence property of the color - dependent potentials while the string tensions obtained from them have little volume dependence as shown in the previous section .",
    "the short - distance coulomb term @xmath98 , which is not related to the color confinement , may not matter on this argument .",
    "figure [ divfor4pot ] shows our nonperturbative numerical results , by which we find that the color - singlet potential has little volume dependence and the absolute value of the color - nonsinglet potentials increases with the lattice volume ; this tendency remains at the distances @xmath99 and @xmath71 as displayed in fig .",
    "[ divfor4pot2 ] .",
    "thereby we conclude that the color - nonsinglet potentials diverge regardless of the distance .",
    "moreover , in order to estimate the degree of divergence for the color - nonsinglet channels , we assume the fitting function @xmath100 for the potential data in the distance @xmath95 ( long range ) .",
    "the corresponding self - energy term @xmath86s fitted well are plotted in fig .",
    "[ divc ] ; this graph shows that the divergence contribution increases monotonically with the volume .",
    "therefore we adopt the linear function @xmath101 where @xmath102 may correspond to the constant meaning the degree of divergence .",
    "the fitted results are summarized in table i , which gives the conclusion that the magnitude of the divergence on the finite lattice depends on the ratio being @xmath103 for @xmath4 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 as observed in the section ii .",
    "e. however , note that they will diverge equally to infinity in the large volume limit , as shown in figs . [ divfor4pot ] and [ divc ] .",
    "this indicates that the color - nonsinglet quarks can not exist independently ; finally , they will become a color - singlet state with finite energy to compensate insufficient color degrees of freedom .",
    "this numerical result does not contradict the dual - ginzburg - landau picture , in which one understands that the color - singlet flux between two quarks is shrunk like a string while the color - nonsinglet flux will radiate rather than produce a closed string .",
    "a singularity of the color flux not making the closed string can be expected to emerge as the volume dependence on the lattice gauge theory .",

    "we have studied the long - distance color - dependent forces between two quarks in the quenched @xmath19 lattice simulation with the polyakov line correlator .",
    "we here focus the color - coulomb instantaneous term in coulomb gauge qcd , which has been discussed in the gribov - zwanziger confinement scenario and is required to make the hadron bound state consisting of quarks .",
    "our numerical simulation shows that the color - singlet @xmath1 channel as well as the color - antitriplet @xmath3 ( diquark ) channel causes a linearly confining potential at large distances .",
    "the other color - octet and color - sextet channels at large distances yield also repulsive forces .",
    "in addition , we find that the string tensions in the color - singlet and color - antitriplet channels have not significant volume dependence    we also investigated the infrared divergence of color - nonsinglet potentials and find that the divergence on the finite lattice seems to be proportional to the color ( casimir ) factor ; however , the divergence of the color - singlet channel is not left over , in the infinite volume limit the color - dependent potentials except the color - singlet channel will diverge ; in particular , the color - sextet channel diverges most strongly as expected .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the dual - ginzburg - landau picture of the color confinement .",
    "this approach , in which we take notice of the color - coulomb instantaneous part , may be suitable for further work to investigate three - quark color - dependent forces for the understanding of baryons as well as new multiquark particles .",
    "it is also necessary to study how the vacuum polarization term affects the instantaneous forces because it is reported in refs .",
    "@xcite that the octet ( adjoint ) channel calculated by the full - length polyakov line correlator with the vacuum polarization gives the complicated distance dependence at large distances .",
    "the simulation was performed on sx-5 and sx-8 ( nec ) vector - parallel computers at the rcnp of osaka university .",
