    "nanoparticles exhibit chemical and structural inhomogeneities insomuch as they appear in various morphologies , regardless of the production method used@xcite .",
    "even a well - crystallized nanoparticle with a well - defined polyhedral shape consists of low - coordinated surface atoms that are obviously dissimilar to high - coordinated ( bulk - like ) atoms .",
    "one recognizes immediately by inspection that the bulk - like atoms have indeed a local ( bonding ) environment that resembles the _ bulk solid _ _ _ _ _ whereas the surface atoms along the edges or at the corners have similarities with the atoms of _ atomic clusters _ _ _ _ _ in regard to bonding and local coordination . utilizing these similarities ( or dissimilarities ) in elucidating",
    "the properties of nanoparticles would be rewarding since one could then employ similarity search methods@xcite in computer - aided design of nanoparticles with customized properties .",
    "we should like to complement this consideration by noting that similarity measures / indices@xcite based on quantum - chemical descriptors@xcite have long been available , which proved to be promising in carrying out various tasks related to a multitude of physicochemical phenomena , such as comparing properties and reactivities of different molecular systems@xcite , deriving quantitative structure - activity or -property relationships@xcite , and identification of the active molecular sites@xcite .",
    "clearly these efforts demonstrate the utility of the similarity - based analysis in molecular design@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure and/or properties of nanoparticles have _ never _ _ _ _ _ been explored via the notion of the ( quantum ) similarity .",
    "this is , in our opinion , due to lacking a _ complete_____@xcite similarity - based representation of atomic environments , which furnishes an adequate description for the nanoparticle atoms .",
    "the present study is thus devoted to fulfill an objective along this line : first , we develop a descriptor - based representation of atomic environments by devising _ two _ _ _ _ _ local similarity indices that are defined from the atom - partitioned@xcite _ shape function_____@xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the electronic density function and number of electrons , respectively .",
    "then , we employ this representation to explore the size- , shape- , and composition - dependent nanocrystal energetics via the notion of quantum similarity .",
    "we focus on an _ energy difference _ _ _ _ _ @xmath0 , which is related to the _ atomic chemical potential _ _ _ _ _ , for its utility in the modelling and simulation of nanoparticles@xcite .",
    "this energy difference and the local similarity indices were obtained by performing first - principles calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) for ( i ) a set of _ database _ _ _ _ _ systems including unary atomic clusters in the shape of regular polyhedra and the bulk solids of c , si , pd , and pt , and ( ii ) a _ test set _ _ _ _ _ for validation , which includes a variety of unary nanocrystals as well as binary pt - pt nanoalloys and pt - c nanocompounds . regarding the energy difference @xmath0 as a `` property '' and exploring its correlations with the local similarity indices , we find that there _ exists _ _ _ _ _ an interconnection between nanocrystal energetics and quantum similarity measures .",
    "furthermore , we introduce an interpolation procedure in order to obtain total energies and energy differences from the two similarity indices .",
    "the latter enables us to demonstrate that the similarity - based energies could be utilized in computer - aided design of nanoparticles .",
    "although one of the similarity indices ( denoted by @xmath4 below ) employed in this study is of the same form as the local carb index@xcite , we find it necessary to introduce a _",
    "second _ _ _ _ _ similarity index ( denoted by @xmath5 below ) in order to achieve an adequate chemical representation .",
    "our findings reveal that using a single similarity index , cf .",
    "@xmath4 , leads to a bijection between @xmath4 and @xmath0 _ if and only if _ _ _ _ _ the set of systems are restricted to include _ equilibrium _ _ _ _ _ structures .",
    "this has the obvious drawback that it requires _ a priori _ _ _ _ _ knowledge of the _ equilibrium _ _ _ _ _ geometries .",
    "thus we find the introduction of a second similarity index necessary , which enables us to extend the aforementioned bijection to cover a generalized set of systems , including strained ( compressed or dilated ) systems .",
    "hence the foregoing drawback is overcome by using _",
    "two _ _ _ _ _ similarity indices with adequately tailored functional forms given below .",
    "it should be emphasized that this approach makes a similarity - based representation of the potential energy surfaces@xcite accessible thanks to the inclusion of the strained systems , which facilitates an adequate description of physicochemical processes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the next section is devoted to the methodological aspects which also summarizes the computational details .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the calculation results before concluding remarks given in the last section .",
    "in this section we first define the energy difference @xmath0 and the similarity indices that constitute the employed chemical representation .",
    "we then describe ( i ) the set of _ database _ _ _ _ _ systems that are used to construct a database for the purpose of exploring correlations between energy differences and local similarity indices , and ( ii ) the _ test set _ _ _ _ _ employed for validation .",
    "next we introduce an _ ad hoc _ _ _ _ _ interpolation procedure that enables one to compute the similarity - based energy differences and total energies .",
    "we finalize this section with a description of our computational modelling framework .",

    "recent investigations@xcite by one of the present authors have indicated that the energy difference @xmath0 could be utilized to introduce a _ scale _ _ _ _ _ of energy on which small ( less stable , more reactive ) and large ( more stable , less reactive ) nanocrystals are naturally ordered near the higher ( @xmath18 ) and lower ( @xmath19 ) ends of the scale , respectively .      in the present study ,",
    "the isolated ( free ) atom is employed as a _ reference _ _ _ _ _ system for each atomic species : namely , the free c , si , pd , or pt atoms are used as a reference for the c , si , pd , or pt atoms in any system , viz . atomic clusters , bulk solids , or nanocrystals , respectively .",
    "this is advantageous for computational efficiency and avoids the need for an alignment@xcite procedure .",
    "it implies that the similarity of an atom of a certain type in a system is measured with respect to the free atom of the same type , regardless of the type of the system ( atomic cluster , bulk solid , or nanocrystal ) . the local ( atom - partitioned ) carb index , which here serves as an indicator of similarity of an atom @xmath20 , located at @xmath21 , of type @xmath22 in the system under consideration to the free @xmath22 atom ,",

    "in this study , first - principles calculations are employed for building a database that comprises @xmath0 and ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) values for the _ unary _ _ _ _ _ atomic clusters in the shape of platonic or archimedean solids .",
    "in addition to these regular polyhedra , dimers c@xmath32 , si@xmath32 , pd@xmath32 , and pt@xmath32 , and the bulk solids of c , si , pd , and pt are included in this database .",
    "it should be emphasized that not only equilibrium systems ( @xmath33 ) but also _ compressed _ _ _ _ _ or _ dilated _ _ _ _ _ systems ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) are included in this set . the systems in this set are called here _ database _ _ _ _ _ systems for ease of speech , which are thoroughly used for the purpose of exploring the correlations between the @xmath0 and @xmath4 or @xmath5 values .",
    "that the set of _ database _ _ _ _ _ systems comprise only _ equivalent _ _ _ _ _ atoms makes it possible to set @xmath36 in equation  ( [ eqmu ] ) , where @xmath37 denotes the dft - calculated total energy . for each _ database _ _ _ _ _ system , plotting @xmath0 values as a function of @xmath4 yields a convex curve that could accurately be parameterized , as demonstrated below .",
    "accordingly , for a given _ database _ _ _ _ _ system @xmath20 , the energy difference defined in equation  ( [ eqmu ] ) is represented by @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes a polynomial function of forth order ( whose coefficients are determined by fitting to the dft - calculated values ) . it is found that one must employ a distinct function @xmath39 with a unique set of polynomial coefficients for each system . thus the @xmath38 relationships are tabulated for all _ database _ _ _ _ _ systems with @xmath40 c , si , pd , pt in tables  1 - 4 in supplementary data .",

    "a variety of cubic supercells with a side length in the range 1530    were used for the atomic clusters and nanocrystals , which included a vacuum region that put at least 10    distance between nearest atoms of two systems in neighboring supercells .",

    "hence sufficiently large supercells were used in the computation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the bulk solids , and it was confirmed that the computed values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are independent of the size of the employed supercells .",
    "in this section we first investigate the correlations between the energy difference @xmath0 and local ( atom - partitioned ) carb index .",

    "the points ( a ) or curves ( b ) corresponding to dimers and bulk solids are labeled while the unlabeled symbols represent the atomic clusters in the shape of regular polyhedra . ]",
    "the plot of the _ equilibrium _ _ _ _ _ energy difference @xmath67 versus the local carb index @xmath4 is displayed in figure  1(a ) .",
    "it is noticeable that there exists a correlation between @xmath67 and @xmath4 , which appears to be a distinct relationship for each atomic species .",
    "note that the correlation is seemingly _ linear _ _ _ _ _ for the pd and pt systems ( as marked by the dashed line passing through the set of pt systems ) .",
    "furthermore , it is seen that the set of pd and pt systems are grouped , i.e. , they fall nearly on the same line . for the si systems",
    "the correlation could also be regarded _",
    "approximately _ _ _ _ _ linear whereas the points for the c systems fall on a monotonic curve that is _ not _ _ _ _ _ linear and show a more pronounced scatter . yet , overall , there seems to exist a roughly one - to - one correspondence , i.e. , bijection , between the _ equilibrium _ _ _ _ _ energy difference @xmath67 and @xmath4 , regardless of the atomic species .",
    "this implies that the variety of local environments sampled by the _ database _ _ _ _ _ systems are adequately reflected by the atom - partitioned carb index . on one hand , this finding implying that a single number , viz .",
    "@xmath4 , per atom ( as opposed to a function of space ) suffices to capture _ energetics trends _ _ _ _ _ is striking in the view of the holographic electron density theorem@xcite which applies to the local electronic ground state density , i.e. , a function of space restricted to some region ( as opposed to a number ) .",
    "it could , on the other hand , be expounded by noting that _ similar _ _ _ _ _ atoms ( viz .",
    "atoms with close @xmath4 values ) would exhibit _ similar _ _ _ _ _ energetic stability ( as indicated by close @xmath0 values ) .",
    "( a)-(d ) and the similarity index @xmath5 ( e)-(h ) versus the similarity index @xmath4 for the c ( a ) and ( e ) , si ( b ) and ( f ) , pd ( c ) and ( g ) , and pt ( d ) and ( h ) systems .",
    "the circles represent the calculation results to which the solid - line curves are fitted . the curves corresponding to dimers and bulk",
    "solids are labeled while the unlabeled symbols represent the atomic clusters in the shape of regular polyhedra . ]",
    "it is obviously interesting to see if the preceding analysis for the unstrained systems could as well be applied to the ( negatively or positively ) strained systems , i.e. , if one could introduce a generalized @xmath0-@xmath68 relationship .",
    "thus the plot of the energy difference @xmath0 versus the atom - partitioned carb index @xmath4 is drawn in figure  1(b ) for the pt systems , where the small ( large ) circles represents strained ( equilibrium ) systems .",
    "note that the large solid ( red ) circles as well as the ( red ) dashed lines on both panels of figure  1 are identical .",
    "the small ( black ) circles represent the dft - calculated ( @xmath0,@xmath4 ) values .",
    "it is seen that the ( @xmath0,@xmath4 ) points fall on a distinct convex curve ( represented by solid lines ) for each system .",
    "this observation is of practical significance , which makes it possible to parameterize @xmath0 as a function of @xmath4 . in practice , this parameterization was carried out by using a distinct polynomial function @xmath69 with a unique set of polynomial coefficients \\{@xmath70 } for each system @xmath20 , yielding the solid - line curves given in figure  1(b ) , which are obtained via fitting to the dft - calculated points . repeating the same procedure for the c , si , and pd systems results in the @xmath0-@xmath68 curves given in the top panels of figure  2 where , for each atomic species , the curves for the atomic clusters lay necessarily between the curves for the dimer and bulk solid . on the other hand , despite the utility of the @xmath0-@xmath68 parameterization , there exists now _ no _ _ _ _ _ one - to - one correspondence between the energy difference @xmath0 and the atom - partitioned carb index , i.e. , a given value of @xmath4 does not correspond to a _ unique _ _ _ _ _ _ database _ _ _ _ _ system .",
    "thus one can utilize the atom - partitioned carb index as a measure of similarity _ only _ _ _ _ _ for equilibrium systems .",
    "this , however , require _ a priori _ _ _ _ _ knowledge of the interatomic distances \\{@xmath14 } ; in other words , the equilibrium geometries .",
    "as mentioned above , this limitation is lifted by devising a _ second _ _ _ _ _ indicator @xmath5 of local similarity given in equation  ( [ eq2nd ] ) .",
    "note that one would in principle need to use the local electronic ground state density@xcite rather than numeric value of an integral of it , viz .",
    "@xmath4 , in order to differentiate closely - related systems , cf .",
    "the holographic electron density theorem .",
    "our analysis reveals that a pair of local similarity indices @xmath71 constitute an adequate chemical representation adopted here since a single similarity index fails to reflect _",
    "energetic trends _ _ _ _ _ once the variations with the interatomic distance @xmath9 are taken into account .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  2 show the plot of @xmath5 versus @xmath4 for the _ database _ _ _ _ _ systems .",
    "although the two similarity indices are not genuinely independent of each other , cf .",
    "equations  ( [ eq1st ] ) and ( [ eq2nd ] ) , the @xmath5-@xmath4 curves appear to be distinct for each system . furthermore all curves lie in the same region bounded by the dimer curve acting as an upper bound and the curve for the bulk solid , which serves as a lower bound .",
    "interestingly , one could make the same observation in the top panels of figure  2 , where all the @xmath0-@xmath68 curves are also bounded by the dimer and bulk curves .",
    "thus the @xmath72-@xmath68 curves and the @xmath0-@xmath68 curves are roughly ordered in a similar fashion .",
    "this finding encourages one to utilize the _",
    "second _ _ _ _ _ similarity index ( in combination with the local carb index ) to establish a bijection between the energy differences and similarity indices .",
    "the latter is achieved by employing the _ ad hoc _ _ _ _ _ interpolation formula given in equation  ( [ wii ] ) , which enables one to obtain the contribution @xmath41 of atom @xmath42 to the similarity - based total energy difference @xmath46 from the similarity indices @xmath73 .",
    "computed via equation  ( [ eqeloc ] ) for a series of pd nanocrystals ( top graphs ) , pt - pd nanoalloys ( middle graphs ) and pt nanocrystals ( bottom graphs ) .",

    "figure  3 displays color - coded graphs of @xmath41 values for a series of pd nanocrystals ( top graphs ) , pt - pd nanoalloys ( middle graphs ) and pt nanocrystals ( bottom graphs ) .",
    "the scales on the left hand side represent the range for the computed values of @xmath41 for pd atoms ( top scale ) and pt atoms ( bottom scale ) .",
    "the higher end ( blue ) of these scales corresponds to less stable ( more reactive ) atoms while the lower end ( red ) corresponds to more stable ( less reactive ) atoms .",
    "it is encouraging to see that the bulk - like atoms near to the center of a nanocrystal have @xmath74 and @xmath75 values around the lower end whereas @xmath74 and @xmath75 values are considerably higher for the low - coordinated atoms located on the faces , along the edges , or at the corners . thus using the @xmath41 values",
    "facilitates the characterization of the energetic ( site - specific , morphology - dependent ) inhomogeneity of the nanocrystals .",
    "moreover _ energetics trends _ _ _ _ _ in regard to the size - dependence appears to be reasonable as one approach bulk - like energies in going from small to large nanocrystals .",
    "besides using the set of @xmath76 or @xmath77 values enables one to look into local ( e.g. , site - specific ) mixing of @xmath22- and @xmath78-type atoms in a binary alloy formation .",
    "for example , comparative inspection of pt@xmath79 , pt@xmath80pd@xmath81 , and pd@xmath79 in figure  3 shows that the pt atoms at the corners of pt@xmath80pd@xmath81 are less energetic in comparison those of pt@xmath79 , indicating that alloying pt nanocrystal with pd increases the energetic stability of the corner ( pt ) atoms . since a similar analysis",
    "could be applied to any nanocrystal in a site - specific manner , using the set of @xmath41 values would clearly be useful in elucidating trends in the size- , shape- and composition - dependent nanocrystal energetics .",

    "performing a sum over atoms as in equation  ( [ eqesim ] ) enables one to obtain @xmath46 from the set of the atomic contributions @xmath41 , cf .",
    "figure  3 .",
    "it is then crucial to inquire if @xmath46 could be utilized in lieu of @xmath82 ( calculated directly ) for practical purposes , e.g. , in the computer - aided design of nanocrystals .",
    "thus the plot of @xmath46 versus @xmath82 is drawn for the _ test _ _ _ _ _ systems in figure  4 where the calculation results are included for a variety of nanocrystal sizes and shapes as well as a range of alloy / compound compositions with various mixing patterns .",
