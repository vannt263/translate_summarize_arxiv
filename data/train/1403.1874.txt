    "these are then used to compute @xmath45 for the subsequent timestep .",
    "we integrate the radiation field along 84 rays , distributed nearly uniformly over the half unit sphere , taking advantage of the reflection symmetry of two dimensional cartesian domains .",

    "a more detailed description of the algorithm and its implementation will be provided in a forthcoming work ( jiang et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in fld , one drops the radiation momentum equation from the evolution equations , replacing it with a diffusion equation for the flux @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the flux - limiter .",
    "the radiation energy equation is then solved by substituting this relation for @xmath48 in equations ( [ eq : srcrade])-([eq : radenergy ] ) .",

    "strictly speaking , it is the comoving frame flux for which the diffusion approximation applies in high optical depth media .",
    "however , the low vales of @xmath2 in the simulations lead to very small differences between the eulerian and comoving frame fluxes .    due to the ad hoc aspects of this approximation , it is not as reliable as our vet method , which evolves the radiation momentum equation and uses a solution of the radiation transfer equation to estimate @xmath56 .",
    "modulo the velocity dependent terms that we neglect in computing @xmath35 ( and only in computing @xmath35 ) , the accuracy of our approximation can always be improved by increasing the angular resolution .",

    "well known deficiencies of this method include its inability to cast shadows ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the radiation field diffuses around opaque barriers , even in optically thin environments .",
    "we have implemented fld in athena only to facilitate comparison of our vet calculation with previous fld - based results , since it aids in determining which aspects of the calculation depend on the transfer method .",
    "our simulation setup follows the computations performed in kt12 . the goal is to simulate the evolution of the interstellar gas in ulirgs , although the results may generalize to other rapidly star forming environments .",
    "we assume that the gas and dust are strongly coupled , both dynamically and thermally",
    ". this assumption should be quite reasonable for ulirgs , as discussed in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "hence , the gas and dust are assumed to share a common temperature ( hereafter simply referenced as the gas temperature @xmath24 ) , and any momentum exchanged between the dust and radiation field is rapidly shared via collisions with the gas .",
    "following kt12 , the planck @xmath57 and rosseland @xmath58 mean opacities are given by @xmath59 this @xmath60 scaling approximately holds for dust in thermal equilibrium with a blackbody radiation field for @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "this implicitly assumes the characteristic temperature of the radiation and @xmath24 are equal .",
    "since we evolve the radiation energy density , we can define a characteristic radiation temperature @xmath62 and check a posteriori if @xmath63 .",
    "this is generally a good approximation although modest differences are present in some regions , which motivated us to perform alternative simulations with @xmath64 .",
    "the two sets of simulations agreed very closely with each other so we report only the @xmath65 here .",
    "these assumptions imply that the radiation field is characterized by blackbodies with @xmath66 k. since the main source of radiation is massive stars emitting primarily in the uv , this analysis assumes the direct stellar radiation has already been reprocessed by the dust and converted to infrared radiation .",
    "the simulations are performed on a two - dimensional , cartesian grid . for simplicity , the gravitational acceleration @xmath67 is assumed to be constant and the radiation field is sourced by a constant flux @xmath68 , incident at the lower boundary .",

    "furthermore , it had the weakest transient acceleration at the beginning of the simulation , reached the lowest maximum vertical extent , and had the lowest maximum velocity dispersion . in this sense , the run represented the worst case for driving turbulence and outflows among the runs considered by kt12 .        in our work , we consider two runs : one using our fld module ( t3f0.5fld ) and one using the vet module ( t3f0.5vet ) , in order to assess the impact of the radiation transfer method . in principle , we could simply compare our vet method directly against the orion fld results , but we perform athena fld runs to control for differences in the hydrodynamics algorithms between athena and orion .",
    "the simulations were initialized with the goal of nearly reproducing the kt12 setup .",
    "one notable exception is that both runs have sinusoidal and random perturbations , as described in equation ( [ eq : pert ] ) .",
    "we made this choice after running a simulation with the vet module that only included sinusoidal perturbations . in that case , the development of non - linear structure ( due to the rti , as discussed below ) was slower than seen in kt12 and most of the mass in the shell was able to reach the top of the domain before this structure produced a significant feedback on the radiative acceleration of the shell .",
    "since the sinusoidal perturbation is a artificial construction and because we were interested in the evolution of an atmosphere with significant non - linear structure , we seeded the rti with additional random perturbations .",
    "this allowed for faster development of the rti in the vet runs .",
    "we also initialize the fld run with random perturbations to facilitate direct comparison between our fld and vet runs .",
    "we first consider the results from t3f0.5fld , which we run for @xmath133 .",
    "this is run in a taller box than the t10f0.02vet simulation , with the initial condition and boundary conditions described in section  [ setup ] .",
    "note that we began the simulations with @xmath134 in equation ( [ eq : limiter ] ) to place a floor on @xmath54 and avoid convergence problems in our backward euler scheme .",
    "this was sufficient for the first @xmath135 , but we had to increase @xmath136 at @xmath137 to ensure convergence thereafter .",
    "as in the t10f0.02vet run , there is an initial increase in @xmath116 at the base of the domain due to the finite optical depth , constant incoming flux , and close thermal coupling between gas , dust , and radiation .",
    "this increase in @xmath24 drives an increase in @xmath58 , resulting in an increase of the radiation force above the gravitational force .",
    "hence , the lower part of the atmosphere quickly becomes super - eddington , and the vast majority of the mass is driven upward in a thin shell .",
    "figure  [ f : t3f0.5fld ] shows snapshots of @xmath7 and @xmath116 from four different times . by @xmath138 ,",
    "the shell has already begun to break up , with some material running behind the shell ( or even falling back ) in a number of plumes .",
    "this behavior is consistent with expectations that the shell should be subject to the rti when accelerated against gravity by the radiation forces under these conditions .",
    "( see section [ rti ] for further discussion . )",
    "our results are also qualitatively consistent with those of kt12 , who also attribute the non - linear structure to rti .",
    "the growth of non - linear structure in our run is somewhat faster and the structures are less uniform , consistent with our additional random perturbations , which seed the growth of smaller scale structure .",
    "subsequent evolution is also consistent with kt12 .",
    "the rti plumes grow into high density filaments interspersed with lower density channels .",
    "since @xmath139 is largest in the low density channels , there is an anti - correlation of @xmath139 and @xmath7 that reduces the momentum exchange between the radiation field and gas .",
    "the radiation forces become sub - eddington in the optically - thick , high - density filaments and the majority of the matter falls back by @xmath129 .",
    "this behavior is reinforced by a drop in the volume averaged optical depth , which leads to a drop in @xmath116 ( and therefore @xmath24 ) at the base of the atmosphere , further reducing the radiation force .",
    "by @xmath140 , almost all of the mass is contained in the bottom @xmath141 of the domain and remains there for the duration of the run , which we stop at @xmath142 .",
    "as expected from the lack of a one - dimensional equilibrium , the matter at the base of the domain does not settle into a hydrostatic equilibrium , but instead remains in a turbulent state , with a moderate velocity dispersion and very little average vertical motion .",
    "again , this quasi - steady state turbulent flow is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the results in kt12 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the vet run labeled t3f0.5vet .",
    "this simulation began in a domain with the same dimensions , resolution , and initial condition as in the t3f0.5fld run .",

    "initially , the dynamics of the simulation are qualitatively consistent with the t3f0.5fld run .",
    "again , @xmath116 and @xmath24 rises rapidly at the base of the domain and the bulk of the mass is launched upward as a shell .",
    "the rti seems to grow slightly slower than in the fld run , but is still fairly rapid and significant growth of non - linear structure is apparent by @xmath143 .",
    "the difference between the fld and vet runs become more apparent in the subsequent evolution . as in the t3f0.5fld run",
    ", there is a flux - density anti - correlation that allows high density filaments to become sub - eddington even as the volume averaged structure remains super - eddington .",
    "some of these high - density filaments do fall back to the base of the domain , where they are reflected by the boundaries .",
    "others are disrupted and reaccelerated by the radiation field as they disperse .",
    "the overall evolution leads to a gradual filling of the volume with @xmath144 gas , although most of the mass remains in several dense filaments .    at @xmath145 ,",
    "the dense gas reaches the upper boundary of the initial domain and the assumptions made for the radiation boundary condition ( near vacuum with no incoming radiation ) cease to be valid .",
    "this leads to an abrupt , unphysical increase in @xmath116 at the upper boundary .",

    "note that @xmath169 multiplies @xmath170 to give the momentum per unit area transfered from the radiation to the gas while @xmath161 would be the characteristic value for the total infrared optical depth @xmath171 in a uniform medium .",

    "the key point is that even modest variations @xmath48 can lead to rather large differences in the outcome when systems are near an eddington ratio of unity .",

    "is largely determined by the value of @xmath179 in figure  [ f : feddcomp ] .",

    "the @xmath97 and @xmath98 components of @xmath178 show a modest initial increase , followed by a faster rises in @xmath122 as the rti sets in and the shells start to break apart .",
    "the subsequent evolution for t3f0.5fld involves a weak decline in @xmath122 compensated by a slow increase in @xmath121 . these trends",
    "roughly cancel so that @xmath178 fluctuates about @xmath184 for the majority of the simulation , consistent with the results of kt12 .",
    "the t3f0.5vet evolution displays a more continuous rise in @xmath122 , with only a brief drop after @xmath185 , when @xmath124 increases quickly during a period of moderately high @xmath158 .",
    "we find a slow , continuous rise in @xmath121 , similar to the t3f0.5fld .",
    "when we need to stop the run shortly after @xmath186 , @xmath178 is still increasing and already a factor of @xmath187 larger than in t3f0.5fld .",
    "in this work , we have revisited the calculations of kt12 , but have been unable to reproduce all of their results with our more accurate vet radiation transfer algorithm .",
    "in contrast , our own implementation of the fld algorithm seems to agree well with their calculations , indicating that discrepancies arise from the use of the fld approximation , rather than implementation differences between the athena and orion codes .",
    "although we reproduce several aspects of kt12 s results ( see section  [ results ] ) , in this section we focus primarily on the discrepancies , and describe the deficiencies of the fld algorithm that we believe are primarily responsible .     and",
    "the two sets of vectors show the direction of @xmath48 , with length scaled by magnitude .",
    "the white vectors are values of @xmath48 computed by the vet algorithm and the green vectors represent the fluxes that would be inferred from fld ( equation [ [ eq : fld ] ] ) using the @xmath20 in the vet run . to show detail , we only plot a small fraction of the domain .",
    "the snaphsot corresponds to @xmath188 , when the disruption of the shell is well underway , but not complete.[f : dens_flux],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    first , we note that our vet calculations do closely reproduce the kt12 results in the stable regime .",
    "therefore , qualitative differences in the evolution arise from the development of non - linear structure , driven by the rti .",
    "although the development of the rti is slightly slower in the vet case , some general aspects of the evolution are similar to the fld simulations : a thin shell develops , becomes unstable to rti , breaks up into high density filaments interspersed with low - density channels , and eventually settles to state with @xmath189 at late times .    in spite of these qualitative similarities ,",
    "the differences in transfer methods have a fairly striking impact on the evolution of the velocity and spatial distributions of the gas . for the majority of the vet simulation , the radiation force exceeds gravity and the net vertical velocity is always positive . in contrast , the fld results only see a transient acceleration phase followed by fallback of most of the gas , and settle into quasi - steady state turbulence with a scale height and velocity dispersion which are much too low to explain observed systems .",
    "we would like to understand what aspects of the fld method lead to these discrepancies in evolution .",
    "we note that since both simulations reach eddington ratios near unity , only modest differences are needed to produce divergent outcomes .",
    "figure [ f : dens_flux ] shows a snapshot of @xmath7 for the t3f0.5vet run at @xmath188 .",
    "we focus on a small fraction of the domain where the shell is being disrupted .",
    "the white vectors denote the @xmath48 values , scaled by magnitude , from the vet calculation . for comparison",
    ", we also plot green arrows showing what @xmath48 would be using equation ( [ eq : fld ] ) with the values @xmath20 in the vet run .        in the densest regions , our vet calculations are nearly in the diffusion limit where the fld method is reliable , and the two sets of vectors are in approximate agreement . in lower density regions , where the diffusion approximation is poor ,",
    "the magnitude of the fld flux is much larger and the directions may be significantly different , even anti - parallel .",
    "for example , below and adjacent to the large plume in the center of the figure , the fld fluxes point downward or horizontal while the vet fluxes point nearly upward almost everywhere in the domain .",
    "since the radiation forces are proportional to @xmath48 , the fld fluxes would not be opposing the downward motion of the plume to the same extent as the vet flux and may even be reinforcing it .",
    "in contrast , the underdense regions near @xmath190 and with @xmath191 have implied fld fluxes that significantly exceed the vet fluxes .",
    "this means that ( relative to vet ) the fld radiation forces would be more effective at reinforcing the development of the low density channels that are forming .",
    "overall , the tendency is for fld to reinforce the development of non - linear structure to a greater extent than the vet algorithm , which is consistent with the faster non - linear development of the rti in the fld runs .",
    "one objection to the comparison in figure  [ f : dens_flux ] is that the values of @xmath20 in the fld run will not generally be the same as those in the vet run .",
    "figure  [ f : limiter ] avoids this issue by comparing @xmath7 and @xmath192 in the t3f0.5vet run to the same quantities in the t3f0.5fld run . in both cases ,",
    "we focus on a @xmath193 subsets of the simulation domains",
    ". the upper boundaries of these subsets are chosen to so that less than an optical depth of intervening matter lies between the top of the subset and the top boundary of the simulation domain , where vacuum boundary conditions are imposed .    since the mean - free - path of photons is proportional to @xmath194 , @xmath139 will generally be larger when @xmath7 is smaller and vice - versa .",
    "such an anti - correlation is apparent in both runs and is particularly clear when we scale @xmath139 with @xmath20 .",
    "such anti - correlations are expected to be particularly strong if the gradient in @xmath20 is relatively uniform and the diffusion limit applies ( equation [ [ eq : fld ] ] with @xmath195 ) . however , the optical depths across most of the filaments seen in figure  [ f : limiter ] are of order unity or less , so the diffusion limit is not valid and the radiation flux is expected to be less sensitive to local values of @xmath7 .",
    "instead it is determined by the geometry of sources of strong emission and the integrated optical depth along different lines - of - site to these sources .",
    "the local value of the radiation field is determined by non - local properties of the flow .",
    "the vet algorithm accurately captures the variation of @xmath196 in this regime , because the eddington tensor follows from the calculation of the angle dependent radiation transfer equation .",
    "in contrast , the fld radiation field is highly constrained by the ad hoc assumptions that underlie the approximation . there is a single preferred direction ( parallel to @xmath197 ) and the ratio @xmath196 is determined by @xmath54 ( equation [ [ eq : limiter ] ] ) . since @xmath198 and @xmath24",
    "are relatively uniform , the sharp variation of @xmath7 dominates the variation of @xmath54 and , therefore , @xmath199 .",
    "this stronge dependence of @xmath199 on @xmath7 leads to an unphysically high level of anti - correlation between @xmath192 and @xmath7 in low - to - moderate optical depth regions .",
    "the upshot is that fld tends to overestimate the contrast in @xmath48 between the high density filaments and the low density channels , where most of the radiation escapes . in effect , the fld radiation field is more effective at `` punching holes '' through the @xmath7 distribution and then reinforces the resulting channels to a greater degree than in the more accurate vet calculations .",
    "this allows more of the radiation to escape through the low density channels , leading to a lower average radiation force for the majority of the gas .    finally , we note that the fld and vet methods agree well in regions where structures are moderately optically thick ( @xmath200 ) and the diffusion approximation applies .",
    "this suggests that the fld results may still be relevant for systems where the photospheric eddington ratio is low . in these systems ( i.e. systems with low @xmath201 and large @xmath86 ) ,",
    "the radiation force can only exceed the gravitational force at high optical depth , where @xmath24 , and therefore @xmath202 , is sufficiently large .",
    "since our vet solutions differ in important respects from earlier results using fld , it is important to reexamine the implications of rti for radiation feedback . although the current simulation setup is conducive to exploring the role of rti , the choice to start with a hydrostatic initial condition limits the relevance to observations of real star forming galaxies .",
    "this is because the hydrostatic length scale in the problem is @xmath203 ( for @xmath204 and @xmath114 ) and @xmath205 .",
    "hence the domain is nearly two orders of magnitude too small to contain a realistic ulirg disk .",
    "other simplifications , such as the assumption of a constant @xmath67 , approximate grey opacity , and the constant incident infrared flux may also have a strong effect on the evolution .",
    "nevertheless , we can reach some tentative conclusions .",
    "one quantity of interest is the mass - weighted velocity dispersion @xmath178 .",
    "since @xmath178 is growing throughout most of the simulation and @xmath206 at the simulations s end , we view our maximum @xmath178 as a lower bound rather than a characteristic estimate .",
    "we find @xmath207 .",
    "this is about an order - of - magnitude lower than the values typical inferred ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this is unsurprising given the small size of the simulation domain .",
    "it is difficult to assess what implications the trend towards @xmath189 will have for the subsequent evolution of @xmath124 and @xmath178 .",
    "the system is very sensitive to the precise value of @xmath166 when @xmath67 is constant .",
    "if ( on average ) @xmath166 continues to be slightly greater than one , then acceleration will continue and we would expect the scale height and velocities to grow with time indefinitely . in a real system , the vertical variation of @xmath67 would presumably play a significant role in determining an equilibrium scale height and velocity dispersion .",
    "a second question of interest is what is the correct efficiency ( or `` trapping '' ) factor to use in assessing the momentum imparted by radiation pressure . in feedback models for optically thick environments ,",
    "the rate of momentum injection has been parameterized as ( see e.g * ? ? ? * and references therein ) @xmath208 where @xmath209 is an estimate of the momentum transferred to the interstellar gas , @xmath171 is an estimate of the integrated optical depth through the dusty gas at infrared wavelengths , @xmath210 is luminosity of a star ( or star cluster ) , and @xmath211 is an ad hoc reduction factor ( @xmath212 ) included to account for inhomogeneities in the surrounding gas . since @xmath161 corresponds to a volume - weighted average total optical depth , one can estimate @xmath213 , while @xmath169 represents the effective optical depth for momentum exchange . therefore , we estimate the @xmath211 in equation ( [ eq : feedback ] ) as the ratio @xmath214 , where we have time averaged the vet run for @xmath215 .",
    "a value of @xmath216 is in the same range that was considered by @xcite in their calculations .",
    "as noted in section  [ stable ] , our value of @xmath174 agrees with kt12 s @xmath175 ( since @xmath172 ) .",
    "however , in their discussion kt12 argue that @xcite and others likely overestimate @xmath211 .",
    "the origin of this apparent discrepancy lies partly in how one estimates @xmath171 and partly in the dependence of @xmath161 and @xmath169 on @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "first , kt12 estimate @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the temperature at the base of the simulation domain . for our simulation , this quantity is a factor of @xmath219 larger than @xmath161 for t3f0.5vet .",
    "kt12 also perform a number of calculations with @xmath111 , which are associated with lower values of @xmath211 .",
    "although we consider only a single parameter set with @xmath113 , we can derive approximate scalings for @xmath211 with @xmath86 and @xmath220 by assuming that all simulations will approach a characteristic horizontally average vertical profile . at late times",
    "our t3f0.5vet run can be fit approximately by ) implies @xmath221 , which is roughly the ratio returned by our short - characteristics calculation at the top of the domain . for an approximately isotropically emitting , semi - infinite atmosphere , which is essentially what our periodic horizontal boundary conditions provide",
    ", this agrees well with standard grey treatments @xcite . this is greater than the @xmath222 assumed in fld calculations , a limit that is only obtained at large distances from a point source . ]",
    "@xmath223 where quantities with an overbar correspond to @xmath98-dependent , horizontally average quantities ( e.g. @xmath224 ) .",
    "the exceptions are @xmath225    to a reasonable approximation , we find that @xmath226 with a constant @xmath227 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath228 with @xmath229 , we find @xmath230 at the base of the domain , @xmath231 and @xmath232 for @xmath113 , which agrees with our measurement of @xmath233 in t3f0.5vet .",
    "if we assume that all of our simulations will approach @xmath234 at late times we can infer that @xmath235 which is equivalent to kt12 s equation ( 43 ) with @xmath236 .",
    "thus , for a given input flux @xmath68 and constant gravitational acceleration @xmath67 , we can define a characteristic opacity @xmath237 , for which radiative acceleration and gravitational acceleration balance .",
    "then the optical depth @xmath238 can be used in place of @xmath239 in equation ( [ eq : feedback ] ) . in our calculation @xmath240 near the photosphere where @xmath241 .",
    "this is in approximate agreement with conclusion of @xcite that the photospheric opacity is the relevant opacity for evaluating momentum feedback , although it is not clear how precisely this would generalize to other parameters .    alternatively , we can provide an estimate for @xmath211 by combing equations ( [ eq : taubar ] ) and ( [ eq : tauf ] ) to obtain @xmath242 which implies @xmath243 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , in good agreement with the simulation results .",
    "hence , @xmath211 would be a function of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath244 for @xmath245 , although it should be kept in mind that @xmath162 approximation becomes poor for @xmath246 , so there is a limited range where this relation could be physically relevant .",
    "finally , we can use equations ( [ eq : temp2 ] ) and ( [ eq : tauf ] ) to estimate the optical depth using the temperature at the base of the domain @xmath247 this implies @xmath248 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , nearly matching the measured value of @xmath249 from t3f0.5vet .",
    "another question of interest is whether these simulations are consistent with the radiation driving of large scale outflows .",
    "our results show that the simulations approach an eddington ratio near unity for a constant value of @xmath67 . however , if we assume that the gas in real ulirgs is distributed in a disk - like geometry the vertical component of gravity @xmath250 will increase from near zero at the midplane ( where @xmath251 ) to a maximum value set by the overall potential of the galaxy .",
    "it seems plausible that an eddington ratio near unity will also be reached in this case , but it is not clear what would pick out the specific value of @xmath252 where the radiation forces and gravity balance .",
    "however , if this hypothetical equilibrium behaves like our simulations , we would expect a fraction of the gas to be accelerated well beyond this characteristic @xmath252 , because the opacity typically increases while @xmath250 decreases as we approach the midplane .",
    "therefore , gas in low density channels can be efficiently accelerated to high velocities , conceivably approaching the escape velocity from the galaxy .",
    "such acceleration of low density gas to high velocities is seen in our simulations .",
    "for example , when we stop the t3f0.5vet run , 4.1% and 1.2% of the gas had @xmath253 greater than @xmath254 and @xmath255 ( respectively ) .",
    "in typical ulirgs , only a few percent of the gas is observed in the cold neutral outflows , so even a small tail of high velocity gas could explain the observed outflow rates and velocities if @xmath256 can be obtained in more realistic simulations .    in this respect ,",
    "a prominent role of rti in the dynamics could help solve a potential problem with radiation driving  that it can not simultaneously explain both the presence of a radiation supported , quasi - equilibrium gas disk and the launching of outflows .",
    "if all the gas experienced the same radiative acceleration , it would all be in state of hydrostatic equilibrium or it would all be accelerated in an outflow . in an rti",
    "dominated picture , the bulk of the gas can be in a quasi - equilibrium turbulent state with @xmath257 , but the presence of low density channels with larger than average @xmath139 could still allow a modest fraction of the gas to be accelerated out the gas disk . in principle , this could allow radiation to launch outflows even in galaxies that are well below their global eddington limit ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although more realistic calculations are required to assess the effectiveness of this mechanism .",
    "finally , we note that all of our analysis and discussion assumes that only radiation and gravitational forces play a role . in real systems , mechanical feedback from stellar winds , supernovae , cosmic rays , magnetic fields , and other sources may be present .",
    "even if they are not the dominant mechanisms of momentum transfer to the gas , they may still have a measurable impact on the gas velocity and density distributions .",
    "the implication that rti will generically produce density inhomogeneities that drive @xmath166 towards a value @xmath258 may break down if any of these other mechanisms are strong enough to reorient the low density channels and dense filaments .",
    "it seems much more likely that such reorientation will interfere with , rather than enhance , the escape of photons , leading to increased coupling and conceivably to generically super - eddington configurations .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested with future calculations .",
    "we attribute the growth of structure in our simulations primarily to the rti , but other instability mechanisms may play a role , in principle .",
    "section 5.1 of kt12 provides a fairly comprehensive and persuasive discussion why the rti is dominant and other instability mechanisms , such as radiative driving of unstable acoustic modes @xcite , are likely to be absent or unimportant .",
    "here we simply summarize some of the most salient results and refer the reader to kt12 for further details .    although a general solution for linear growth of the radiative rti has never been formulated ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , numerical experiments @xcite suggest that the instability will grow at a rate that can be approximated by @xmath259 , if @xmath260 is a characteristic horizontal wavelength .",
    "this is the analytic prediction in the optically thick limit of an incompressible flow if the density contrast at the base of the shell is large ( i.e. atwood number of unity ) .",
    "radiative diffusion effects can slow the rate of growth , but typically only by factors of order unity unless radiation pressure is much greater that gas pressure . for our simulations",
    ", this timescale evaluates to @xmath261 and we have @xmath262 for @xmath263 .",
    "the growth of the instability on small scales is even faster and there is ample time for growth of the rti to explain the large scale non - linear structure observed at @xmath188 ( and earlier ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     further evidence that the evolution is due to rti is provided by calculations we performed with constant , temperature - independent opacities in the limits of pure scattering or pure absorption .",
    "the simulation setup for these runs were identical to our t3f0.5vet calculations except that @xmath264 .",
    "in the standard runs , with @xmath265 , radiation forces are largest near the base of the domain and decrease with height .",
    "therefore , gas closer to the base of the domain quickly reaches higher velocities than the overlying material and leads to the formation of dense shells with sharp density inversions .",
    "in contrast , the gas in the constant opacity simulations receives an acceleration that is significantly more uniform , and no significant density inversions form until very late in the run . as a result",
    ", there is very little rti , and the small scale random perturbations are smoothed out by diffusion before they can grow appreciably . only the largest scales show non - linear development from the initial sinusoidal perturbation , and the timescale for this growth is much longer .",
    "thus , there is strong evidence that density inversions driven by the @xmath162 opacity law are essential to the dynamics , providing a clear indication that the rti is the dominant instability mechanism .",
    "we have considered the role of the rayleigh - taylor instability in the interaction of infrared radiation fields , dust , and gas in rapidly star - forming environments .",
    "we have focused on the regime of radiation supported , dense gas that may be present in some systems , such as ulirgs .",
    "our primary results stem from the numerical simulation of such environments , which are studied in a simplified problem setup with a constant gravitational acceleration , a constant incident infrared flux on the base of the domain , and initialized with a perturbed isothermal atmosphere to match previous calculations in kt12 .    in the stable regime , we find that the atmosphere settles down into an equilibrium solution in agreement with the previous results . in the unstable regime , we confirm that the rti develops and has a significant impact on subsequent evolution . however , we find that after the growth of the rti , the evolution depends significantly on the choice of algorithm for modeling radiation transfer .",
    "our vet simulations show a stronger coupling between radiation and dusty gas , leading to continuous net upward acceleration of the gas .",
    "no steady state is reached before the end of the calculation , when high density material had reached the top of the domain .",
    "the mean velocities and velocity dispersion are both increasing at the end of the run .",
    "in contrast , our fld calculations broadly reproduce the fld results of kt12 , finding weaker coupling between gas and radiation .",
    "this leads to a short initial burst of acceleration , followed by a period of fallback , finally settling into quasi - steady state turbulence with zero mean velocity and low velocity dispersion . as a result ,",
    "our vet calculations imply a much larger scale height and higher velocity dispersion than the fld - based calculations .",
    "we argue that these discrepancies result from limitations in the diffusion - based fld algorithm , which lead to inaccuracies in modeling how the radiation field responds to structure in the gas distribution that is a few optical depths or smaller in size .",
    "these errors are related to the fld radiation field s tendency to diffuse around denser , optically - thicker structures even when the diffusion limit does not apply .",
    "relative to our vet calculations , this leads the fld radiation forces to be more effective at opening and reinforcing low density channels but less effective at disrupting high density filaments , ultimately reducing the coupling between radiation and dusty gas .    despite the discrepancies in the scale height and velocity distributions",
    ", it appears that both the vet and fld simulations trend towards an approximate balance between the volume - averaged radiation and gravitational forces at late times .",
    "if this behavior is general , it confirms one of the key results of kt12 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting the rate of momentum transfer between radiation and dusty gas may scale approximately as @xmath266 , where @xmath210 is the luminosity , @xmath267 , @xmath77 is the mass surface density , and @xmath268 is the opacity for which the radiation and gravitational accelerations balance . since @xmath202 is generally larger nearer to the midplane , @xmath269 will be lower than estimates of @xmath171 that assume volume - average or mid - plane opacities .",
    "for example , in the simulation parameters considered here ( @xmath270 ) , we infer a total optical depth @xmath271 using a volume - averaged opacity , which must be reduced by an efficiency factor @xmath216 to obtain the correct rate of momentum transfer .",
    "however , if the eddington ratio is always near unity , this efficiency factor may be lower for gas disks or clouds with larger surface densities .",
    "although the simulation setup considered here is useful for studying the development and saturation of the rti , it is not optimally suited for making observational predictions .",
    "future work with more realistic assumptions , such as a vertically varying gravitational acceleration , non - grey opacity , distributed radiation sources , and physically relevant simulation volumes will be necessary to provide robust predictions and facilitate direct comparison with observations .     for snapshots from two versions of the t3f0.5vet run shown at @xmath146 .",
    "the left panel shows results from the standard run with rays distributed in six poloidal levels while the right panel shows results using a single poloidal level , as shown in the left and right panels ( respectively ) of figure  [ f : angdist ] .",
    "as described in section [ angquad ] , the right panel has higher effective angular resolution , reducing ray - effects .",
    "the close agreement between the two runs suggests that the dynamics are not strongly sensitive to our choice of angular grid .",
    "[ f : anglecomp],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the discussion in section  [ comparison ] assumes that the vet radiative transfer algorithm provides a more accurate realization of the radiation field than the fld algorithm .",
    "since we solve the momentum equation ( [ eq : radmomentum ] ) , this should be true , as long as our method for computing the eddington tensor is valid . as discussed in section [ shortchar ] , the main approximation made in our computation of the eddington tensor is the neglect of order @xmath2 terms ( which are retained in the radiation moment equations ) .",
    "we confirm a posteriori that this is a very good approximation .",
    "the only significant potential problem for our vet calculation would be if our angular grid of rays under - resolves the radiation field .",
    "our experience has been that angular resolution used here is more than adequate for previous problems , but angular resolution requirements can vary from problem to problem . in the short characteristics method , the most apparent features in under - resolved systems are usually referred to as `` ray - effects '' , which correspond to unphysical anisotropies in the radiation field correlated with the angular grid .",
    "ray - effects can be particularly problematic when bright point sources dominate the radiation field and scattering opacity is negligible ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the intensity can be overestimated in grid zones that lie along ray directions that point directly back to the point source and underestimated in regions between rays , with a relative error that increases in magnitude with the number of grid zones traversed .",
    "this leads to the appearance of ` rays ' or ` spokes ' in radiation variables emanating radially outward from the point source .",
    "scattering introduces angular diffusion that can mitigate ray - effects ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is absent in the current calculations .",
    "although bright point sources are also absent , dense filaments can lead to rather sharp variations in the emissivity .",
    "ray - effects are most clearly apparent in the low density regions well above the photosphere , reflecting variations in the emissivity near the photosphere that propagate along rays in the angular grid into the regions above .",
    "however , there is very little mass in this region and radiation is less important because the radiation forces are sub - eddington here .",
    "ray - effects are less apparent below the photosphere , but must be present at some level . in order to assess their impact ( if any ) , we reran the t3f0.5vet run with an alternative ray distribution that has effectively higher resolution in the @xmath97@xmath98 plane .",
    "our default ray distribution is shown in the left panel of figure  [ f : angdist ] .",
    "it attempts to cover the unit sphere uniformly , treating all three spatial directions , including the implied third dimension ( @xmath272 ) on equal footing .",
    "this is formally required even though the domain is two dimensional , because rays traveling at different angles relative to @xmath273 will travel different total path lengths for a given displacement in the @xmath97@xmath98 plane .",
    "this means that many of the rays nearly overlap when projected onto the @xmath97@xmath98 plane , and the effective angular resolution in the @xmath97@xmath98 plane is closer to @xmath274 rays per @xmath275 radians , even though we have 84 rays total .",
    "the right panel shows our alternative distribution , in which all rays have the same projection onto the @xmath272-axis ( @xmath276 so that @xmath277 ) .",
    "we distribute 80 total rays uniformly in azimuthal angle @xmath278 ( @xmath279 ) .",
    "this amounts to a factor @xmath280 increase in the effective angular resolution in the @xmath97@xmath98 plane even though the total number of angles is nearly identical .",
    "the higher effective azimuthal angular resolution significantly reduced ray - effects above the photosphere , but had relatively little effect on the eddington tensor below the photosphere , suggesting ray effects were already minor in the original run .",
    "overall , the global properties and evolution of the two simulation were nearly identical",
    ". a sense of how similar the runs are is provide by figure  [ f : anglecomp ] , which compares snapshots of @xmath7 from the two simulation at @xmath146 .",
    "we therefore conclude that our results are well - converged in terms of the effective angular resolution of our vet calculations ."

    "<S> our vet simulations show continuous net acceleration of the gas , with no steady - state reached by the end of the simulation . in contrast , fld results show little net acceleration of the gas and settle in to a quasi - steady , turbulent state with low velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancies result primarily from the inability of fld to properly model the variation of the radiation field around structures that are less than a few optical depths across . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that radiation feedback remains a viable mechanism for driving high - mach number turbulence . </S>",
