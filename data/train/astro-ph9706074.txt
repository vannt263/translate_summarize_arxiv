    "it is well known , that if the gamma ray bursts ( grb ) origin from the mergers of relativistic binary stars , their progenitors should be a strong source of gravitational waves , observable by the detectors of the advanced ligo type .",
    "in addition , there are some reasons to expect that the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) could be also a powerful sources of radio emission . for example , if grb origin from binary neutron stars or neutron stars and black holes mergers , their pre - merger evolution could be accompanied with pulsar - like phenomena arising due to fast orbital motion of two compact objects ( lipunov & panchenko , 1996 ) or their magnitospheric interaction ( vietri , 1996 ; nulsen & fabian , 1984 )",
    ". this emission could be observable as a radio `` before - glow '' of grb .",
    "the observational detection of such radio sources is complicated because their position on the sky is apriori unknown .",
    "but the time delay that occurs in the propagation of low - frequency signal through the galactic and extragalactic plasma makes it possible to observe the signal emitted by the grb progenitors _ before _ the burst _",
    "after _ the burst itself has been already observed and the position is known , thus changing the beforeglow into afterglow .",
    "the delay of a radio signal of a frequency @xmath0 passing a distance @xmath1 through plasma with electron density @xmath2 equals to : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the plasma frequency @xmath5    in the observer frame the same delay is multiplied by @xmath6 .    using for estimate the simple case of a flat universe ( @xmath7 ) with @xmath8 , in which the metric distance is @xmath9 taking into account that the emission frequency changes while it propagates through the universe ( @xmath10 ) and assuming that the relative density of extragalactic plasma @xmath11 is constant within some @xmath12 which implies the electron density @xmath13 at a redshift @xmath12 , we obtain the delay @xmath14 where @xmath15  mhz and the dispersion measure is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18  km / s / mpc .",
    "now the delay can be rewritten as @xmath19    of course , the delay takes place not only in the extragalactic media , where the electron density is @xmath20 , but also in our galaxy , and in the host galaxy .",
    "for example , our galaxy provides the dispersion measures from @xmath21 in the polar direction to @xmath22 in the direction of its center ( taylor , cordes , 1993 )",
    ". the contribution of the host galaxy can be in the same range , or even higher because of its lower age .",
    "thus , we can expect that at a frequency of @xmath23  mhz the delay will be of the order of minutes or tens of minutes , and even hours at @xmath24  mhz .",
    "therefore , the gamma - ray burst allows us to observe up to an hour of its radio prehistory .",
    "let us estimate the radio flux on the base of magnetic dipole energy losses .",
    "the spectral flux density observered at the frequency @xmath25 if the source has a power - law spectrum with the index @xmath26 and is located at a redshift @xmath12 , is equal to    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the spectral luminosity of the source at the frequency @xmath25 .",
    "for the purpose of estimating the flux , let us assume that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the total energy output of the source .",
    "then @xmath31 has the meaning of the `` efficiency of radioemission '' .",
    "if we approximate the total luminosity by the magnetic dipole formula , then we would obtain the flux @xmath32",
    "where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the dipole spin period in milliseconds , and @xmath35    this flux estimate is rather high , which means that even for less efficient energy losses than a dipole one the value of the flux can be over the limit of detection .",
    "as shown in previous sections , the dispersion of the low - frequency emission during its propagation in plasma can lead to the `` time - machine '' effect , allowing us to observe several minutes of the radio prehistory of a grb at @xmath23  mhz , or even hours at @xmath24  mhz .",
    "as shown by lipunov & panchenko ( 1996 ) , this last minute can be accompanied by powerful pulsar - like emission , arising from the fast orbital motion of two magnetic dipoles with millisecond periods . according to the well - known formula , describing the gravitational wave lifetime of a binary ( shapiro & teukolsky , 1983 ) :",
    "@xmath36 a minute before the merger ( which is associated with the grb itself ) the orbital period is @xmath37  ms , and a hour before it is @xmath38  ms .",
    "the pre - grb emission should ( see lipunov & panchenko ( 1996 ) , fig .",
    "2 ) display a quick burst - like power - law growth of intensivity , and should probably be modulated with the decreasing as given by ( [ t(p ) ] ) period .",
    "in general , this emission could be observed as a `` beforeglow '' of a grb together with its gravitational wave `` beforeglow '' , but if the dispersion measure is high enough , the time delay may turn it into its afterglow .    due to the fact that this effect has a strong observational frequency dependance ( @xmath39 )",
    ", it could be preferably detected by the large phased arrays similar to those of pushino and kharkov radio astronomy observatories kharkov , which are sensitive in the frequency range @xmath40  mhz .",
    "the importance of the described effect of `` radio - astronomical time machine '' is that it provides a new tool for studying grb by opening a direct view of their precursors .",
    "also search for it can involve new kinds of radio instruments in the grb follow - up observations programme .",
