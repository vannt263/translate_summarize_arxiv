    "in this appendix we review the derivation of the effective hamiltonian ( [ atom photon interaction ] ) .",

    "general theory about this effect has actually been well established @xcite .",
    "we include the derivation here just to serve our concrete purpose . for simplicity",
    ", we take the optical field to be classical , generalization to the quantum case is straightforward . the alkali atom in question is assumed to be in the @xmath129 @xmath130 hyperfine ground state manifold .",
    "a laser with electric field @xmath131 couples the atom to the @xmath132 excited state manifold ( @xmath5 line ) . here",
    "it is assumed that the frequency of the laser is chosen so that the fine structure of the alkali @xmath4 line is well resolved while the hyperfine structure is not .",
    "this is feasible since the fine structure splitting is generally three or four orders larger in magnitude than the hyperfine structure splitting for the alkali @xmath4 line .",
    "for instance , the fine splitting of the @xmath4 line of @xmath133rb is @xmath134 ghz , while the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath5 line is @xmath135 mhz .",
    "we aim to derive an effective hamiltonian confined in the @xmath130 ground state subspace . by second order perturbation theory and taking the rotating wave approximation",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the electric dipole operator and @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the projection operators on the @xmath130 hyperfine ground state manifold and @xmath140 fine excited state manifold respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , where the sum is over all the possible values of @xmath143 and @xmath144 . for the latter",
    ", we can also transfer from the coupled representation to the uncoupled representation , i.e. , equivalently we have @xmath145 here @xmath146 is purely an electronic projection operator onto the @xmath147 excited state subspace while @xmath148 is purely a nuclear projection operator .",
    "we can also define the project operator @xmath149 which projects onto the ground state manifold up to the fine structure . substituting ( [ uncoupled ] ) and ( [ ground fine ] ) into ( [ second order ] ) and noting that @xmath150 , we rewrite the effective hamiltonian as      note that in the parentheses we have successfully separated the electronic part from the nuclear part .",
    "this is important since the external electric field couples with the electrons but not the nucleus .",
    "we define @xmath152 , which is a vector operator ( and so is @xmath153 ) .",
    "the electronic part in the parentheses in ( [ effective h 2 ] ) is then in the form @xmath154 , which can be rewritten in the form @xmath155 , the scalar contraction of two rank-2 tensors , with the atomic and optical parts separated .",
    "we can decompose the dyadic @xmath156 into rank-@xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath57 irreducible tensors ,      with @xmath160 done similarly .",
    "we note that since @xmath161 acts on a two - dimensional hilbert space , the rank-2 irreducible part vanishes identically .",
    "we can then contract the corresponding irreducible tensors to form scalars .",
    "the result is @xmath162 using the wigner - eckart theorem , we see that in the @xmath147 ground state subspace the scalar operator @xmath163 is proportional to the identity operator while the vector operator @xmath164 to @xmath165 .",
    "thus the above equation is equivalent to @xmath166 with @xmath167 and @xmath168 being some constants and @xmath169 being the laser polarization vector . substituting this result into ( [ effective h 2 ] ) and using again the wigner - eckart theorem , we have finally @xmath170 with @xmath171 being some constant incorporating the land factor @xcite .",
    "the first term describes a center - of - mass shift of the ground state multiplet while the second term is in effect a zeeman term  the very effect we are seeking .",
    "note that for a linearly polarized laser the second term vanishes identically while for @xmath2 and @xmath22 polarized lasers , the fictitious magnetic fields point opposite .",
    "therefore we have shown how an effective hamiltonian like ( 1 ) can arise naturally under certain ciucumstances . to get the coefficients @xmath167 and @xmath171 determined , it is better to resort to the dipole matrix elements tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite .              in this paper",
    "we assume the total atom number @xmath1 is even . for @xmath1 being odd",
    ", the afm ground state is of total spin @xmath172 and thus not strictly isotropic .",

    "<S> the two phases differ in their rotational properties  the afm ground state is a @xmath0 singlet and thus isotropic @xcite ; while the fm ground state is a @xmath0 multiplet heavily degenerate and thus can be well directed ( up to the uncertainty principle associated with the @xmath0 algebra ) . from the point of view of quantum phase transition , these two phases deserve to be distinguished experimentally for their own sake .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method based on cavity quantum electrodynamics techniques to fulfill this object . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is similar to that of mekhov _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where they proposed to probe the superfluidity - mott insulator transition of cold atoms in optical lattices with cavity transmission spectra . in the dispersive regime , </S>",
    "<S> atoms inside the cavity shift the cavity frequency and in turn influence the cavity transmission spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the superfluidity and mott - insulator phases differ in their atom number statistics and thus lead to drastically different cavity transmission spectra , which can be used inversely to differentiate the two phases . in their proposal , it is adequate to treat the atoms in a two - level fashion with the atomic levels structureless . </S>",
    "<S> however , here in our case , we have to go beyond the two - level model and take into account the detailed and realistic atomic level structure . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we can retrieve the vector polarizability @xcite of the atom that is dropped artificially in the two - level model . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that by choosing a circularly polarized cavity mode , the cavity photon couples not only to the total atom number but also to the total magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the latter effect allows us to do our job , since the cavity transmission spectra carry information of the magnetization statistics of the bec , which are absolutely different in the two phases .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume a spin-1 bec of @xmath1 alkali atoms of a certain type is loaded inside an optical cavity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system is probed with a @xmath2 polarized laser so that the relevant cavity mode coupled with the atoms is also @xmath2 polarized . </S>",
    "<S> the bare frequency @xmath3 of this cavity mode is chosen to resolve the alkali @xmath4 line ( fine structure ) and placed relatively near the @xmath5 transition @xcite . however , the detuning between the @xmath5 transition and the cavity mode frequency is still large enough not to resolve the hyperfine structures of the @xmath5 line . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we have latexmath:[$\\delta_{hfs1}\\ll |\\omega_c-\\omega_{d1}|\\ll    magnitude of the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath5 line , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the average frequency of the hyperfine levels of @xmath5 and @xmath9 , respectively . in the appendix we show that the effective hamiltonian describing the atom - cavity photon interaction is ( @xmath10 throughout in this paper ) @xmath11 here @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the field annihilation operator for an atom in the hyperfine state @xmath14 at position @xmath15 ( the quantization direction is along the cavity axis and is denoted as the @xmath16-direction ) , and @xmath17 is the annihilation operator for the cavity photon . the cavity mode function with its maximum normalized to unity is denoted as @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath19 characterizes the strength of the ac - stark shifts of the atomic levels per photon , in the viewpoint of the atoms ; or alternatively , the magnitude of the cavity frequency shift per atom , in the viewpoint of the photons . </S>",
    "<S> formally , we can write @xmath19 as @xmath20 by introducing an effective atom - photon coupling strength @xmath21 , which incorporates the overall effect of coupling with all the hyperfine levels in the @xmath5 line .    here some comments are in order . the main feature of hamiltonian ( [ atom photon interaction ] ) is the spin dependence of the level shifts , which can be interpreted in terms of a fictitious magnetic field . in most experiments aiming to study intrinsic spin dynamics of a spinor bec , this effect is ( and should be ) avoided or minimized by taking the laser beam to be linearly polarized or with a detuning too large to resolve the @xmath4 line or both ( an exception being ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the purpose of continuous observation of spin dynamics and spin magnetization , this effect proves to be useful . actually , it is exactly the same physics that underlies the faraday rotation spectroscopy developed recently for _ in situ _ observation of a spinor bec @xcite . for if the cavity mode is @xmath22 polarized , the plus sign in front of @xmath23 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ atom photon interaction ] ) should be replaced with a minus sign . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the @xmath2 and @xmath22 polarized light respond differently to a given atomic sample  the essence of the faraday rotation effect .    for the spinor bec </S>",
    "<S> , we assume the sma is valid and rewrite the atomic field operators as @xmath24 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 denotes the common spatial mode ( normalized to unity ) for the three spin components and @xmath26 is the annihilation operator associated with the corresponding spin component . under the sma , we can rewrite hamiltonian ( [ atom photon interaction ] ) as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total atom number and @xmath29 is the total magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath30 is proportional to the overlap between the cavity mode function and the condensate mode function . in general , the extension of a condensate is much larger than the period of @xmath31 in the axial direction while much smaller than its waist in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a condensate placed around the axis of the cavity , the integral can be well approximated with @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 commute with both @xmath36 and the hamiltonian of the spinor bec itself . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have a quantum non - demolition measurement </S>",
    "<S> .    assume the probe laser is of frequency @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the heisenberg equation ( in the frame rotating at @xmath37 ) for the cavity mode annihilation operator is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the damping rate of the cavity mode and @xmath40 the driving amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the damping term leads to the stationary solutions of @xmath17 and the photon number @xcite ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the shifted cavity - probe detuning . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of @xmath43 over a prescribed state of the spinor bec is then @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the probability for @xmath35 taking value @xmath46 in the prescribed state . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath47 , where the sum is over all the possible values of @xmath46 . as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the total photon number contains incoherent contributions of a series of coherent states , the @xmath46-th of which is of amplitude @xmath48 and of weight @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , we see from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expectation value ] ) that @xmath49 , as a function of the detuning @xmath50 , is a weighted sum of a series of lorentz functions , which are evenly displaced with @xmath51 and of full - width half - maximum @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that the cavity transmission spectra ( proportional to @xmath49 ) contain information of the atomic statistics embodied in @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now apply the formalism developed above to the two possible phases of a spin-1 bec . for a spin-1 bec in the sma , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian accounting for the spin dynamics is @xmath53 @xcite , with the spin operator @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath55 is proportional to the difference of the s - wave scattering lengthes in the two total spin channels ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the sign of @xmath55 determines the nature of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath58 , the ground state is of total spin @xmath59 and given explicitly as @xcite @xmath60 where the scalar ( rotationally invariant ) operator @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this state is a singlet and also the unique ground state . </S>",
    "<S> for this afm ground state , the magnetization has no fluctuations at all . the only nonvanishing term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expectation value ] ) is @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by scanning the probe frequency @xmath37 , we get the intracavity photon number as a single lorentz function , @xmath63 with a width of @xmath52 and maximum height of unity ( in units of @xmath64 , the maximum possible intracavity photon number ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that it is of the same shape as that of a bare cavity , though the center is shifted by @xmath65 .    if @xmath66 , the ground state is of total spin @xmath67 and @xmath68 fold degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , we have as a set of orthonormal basis @xcite , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the lowering operator for @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath68 states each have a definite magnetization , thus the corresponding transmission spectra is also a single lorentz function ( but the center of which may vary ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , here we are most interested in the experimentally most accessible states  angular momentum coherent states  states that can be obtained by rotating the @xmath16-aligned state @xmath72 , @xmath73 here @xmath74 perpendicular to the @xmath16-axis is the axis of rotation , while @xmath75 is the angle of rotation or inclination angle . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath76 s are determined by @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the state constructed in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ angular momentum coherent state ] ) defines a direction @xmath78 in that it is the eigenstate of @xmath79 with eigenvalue @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these states can be readily prepared with a proper radio - frequency ( rf ) pulse from the state @xmath72 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for such a state , the weight coefficients of the fock states @xmath80 follow the triple - nominal distribution @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , we have @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath85 are independent of the azimuth angle @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable since all angular momentum coherent states with the same inclination angle @xmath75 are connected by rotations around the @xmath16-axis </S>",
    "<S> . therefore they share the same distribution @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution function @xmath45 can be generated in a random walk process . </S>",
    "<S> image a particle , initially at the origin , performing random walks on the real axis . at each step , the particle either moves rightward or leftward or just keeps still , with probabilities @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath45 is just the probability of arriving at @xmath46 after @xmath1 steps . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , @xmath46 is the sum of @xmath1 independent random variables @xmath91 , the common distribution function of which is @xmath92 , with @xmath93 , @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation enables us to calculate @xmath45 both analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> analytically , for @xmath95 , by the central limit theorem , we can approximate @xmath45 with the normal distribution @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( here @xmath99 being the variance of @xmath100 ) are respectively the average value and variance of @xmath46 . numerically , the characteristic function of @xmath45 is @xmath101 . by an inverse fourier transform , we get @xmath45 determined ( it is just the coefficient of @xmath102 in the expansion of @xmath103 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two approaches yield the same result up to a high precision . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , we show the distribution @xmath45 for four different inclination angles with the total atom number @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> we see the larger the absolute value of @xmath105 , the larger the fluctuations of @xmath46 . for all cases , </S>",
    "<S> we see a clear @xmath106 scaling of @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the intracavity photon number @xmath49 by approximating @xmath45 with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ normal distribution ] ) and replacing the sum with an integral . </S>",
    "<S> the integral can be further understood as the convolution of the probability distribution function @xmath45 and a lorentz function . </S>",
    "<S> we can then use the convolution theorem to first solve the fourier transforms of the two functions respectively , form their product , and then take an inverse fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath108 where @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the procedure can be done inversely , i.e. , from the cavity transmission spectra observed experimentally , we can infer the distribution of the magnetization by fourier transforms .    </S>",
    "<S> we can read two facts from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans final expression ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the shape of @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50 is shifted by @xmath110 from that depicted in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expectation value anti ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this overall shift is due to the average deviation of @xmath46 from zero and thus has a classical nature . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the shape of @xmath49 is broadened compared to that in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expectation value anti ] ) , which is due to the fluctuations of @xmath46 around the mean and thus has a quantum nature . the shift and broadening are appreciable if @xmath111 , or in terms of @xmath1 , @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> currently , @xmath21 is about @xmath113 mhz and the line width @xmath39 of the cavity can be made as small as @xmath114 mhz @xcite . by taking the detuning @xmath115 to @xmath116 ghz </S>",
    "<S> , we get @xmath117 khz . </S>",
    "<S> the atom number of a spinor bec is typically on the order of @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see the first condition @xmath119 is well satisfied while the second condition @xmath120 is marginally satisfied . in the near future , </S>",
    "<S> we expect @xmath39 can be reduced by one order and then the second condition can be well met also .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) probability distribution function @xmath45 of the magnetization @xmath46 of ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground states with different inclination angles . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) intracavity photon number at steady state @xmath49 as a function of the detuning @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line corresponds to the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state . </S>",
    "<S> other lines correspond to fm ground states in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are @xmath104 and @xmath121 . for the horizontal labels , @xmath97 and @xmath109 in the fm case , while @xmath122 and @xmath123 in the afm case.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) , we present the intracavity photon number at steady state @xmath49 as a function of the detuning @xmath50 . for the afm ground state , the curve ( solid line ) is a simple lorentzian centered at @xmath123 and with width @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the only possibility . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the fm ground states , depending on the inclination angle @xmath75 , the center and width of the curve vary widely ( the figure may be a bit misleading , but note that we have artificially shifted the curves to a common center ; see the labels of the horizontal axes ) . especially , the broadening effect is apparent compared to the afm case ( here we have @xmath124 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the afm and fm ground states can be distinguished on one hand by the different shapes of the corresponding spectra @xcite and on the other hand by their responses to rf pulses ( or a transverse magnetic field ) . under the action of rf pulses , </S>",
    "<S> the afm ground state remains unaltered since it is rotationally invariant , so the cavity transmission spectra are unchanged . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> , a fm ground state can be tickled to other directions and thus both the center and the width of the transmission spectra will change .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative and more convenient method may be just reversing the polarization of the probe laser . because the @xmath2 and @xmath22 polarized cavity modes couple respectively to @xmath35 and @xmath125 , it is easy to see that for the afm case , the transmission spectra are unaffected ; while for the fm case , the transmission spectra are reflected to be centered at @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the two centers is on the order of @xmath127 , which is much larger than @xmath39 , therefore this effect can be readily observed . </S>",
    "<S> this method makes evident the similarity between our approach and the faraday rotation spectroscopy .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that by choosing a circularly polarized cavity mode , we can achieve coupling between the photon number with the magnetization , i.e. the @xmath16-component of the total spin of the spinor bec . </S>",
    "<S> full statistics of the magnetization of the spinor bec can be extracted from the cavity transmission spectra and this allows us to discern the afm and fm phases , which due to their different rotational properties , possess absolutely different magnetization statistics . </S>",
    "<S> our discussion has been focused on the thermodynamical properties of the bec ( ground state oriented ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clear that the technique can also be used for observing the real - time evolution of a spinor bec . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the condition @xmath128 can be readily fulfilled , the sensitivity can be high .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that our discussion has been greatly simplified by neglecting the center - of - mass motion of the bec and by the sma [ without the two approximations , we can not reduce eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ atom photon interaction ] ) to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sma h ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> these approximations are reasonable if the probe is weak enough . for future works </S>",
    "<S> , however , the strong probe case is worth investigation . </S>",
    "<S> if the probe is so strong that the intracavity optical lattice can not be neglected , center - of - mass motion of the spinor bec can be excited . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the optical lattice felt by different spin components are different , a dynamical sma is inappropriate . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is further complicated by the back - action of the bec on the cavity mode . in the end </S>",
