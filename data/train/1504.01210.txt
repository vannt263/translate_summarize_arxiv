    "let @xmath6 be a finitely generated group ( generated by @xmath0 elements ) , perhaps the fundamental group of a manifold or orbifold @xmath7 , and let @xmath2 be a reductive affine algebraic group over an algebraically closed field @xmath8 .",
    "then the collection of group homomorphisms @xmath9 is naturally a @xmath8variety cut out of the product variety @xmath10 via the relations defining @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath2 admits a faithful morphism into @xmath11 , we call @xmath9 the @xmath2representation variety of @xmath6 . standard in representation theory is that two representations are equivalent if they are conjugate .",

    "the purpose of this note is to prove that the singularities of a character variety @xmath3 are always well behaved , when @xmath2 is reductive and @xmath1 is a rank @xmath0 free group .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the situation when @xmath6 is not free ; see @xcite .",
    "in particular , we characterize when @xmath3 is factorial ( in arbitrary characteristic ) and show it is always gorenstein ( when @xmath16 ) .",
    "this allows us to describe conditions when the picard group of @xmath17 is trivial .    in general , regular rings ( smooth varieties )",
    "are local complete - intersection rings ( varieties locally cut out by codimension relations ) which are gorenstein .",
    "all gorenstein rings are cohen - macaulay , and assuming the singular locus lies in codimension at least 2 , this further implies normality ( which implies irreducibility )",
    ". so gorenstein varieties ( coordinate rings are gorenstein ) are situated between complete - intersections and cohen - macaulay varieties .",
    "factorial varieties ( coordinate rings are unique factorization domains ) fall slightly in between . when they are additionally normal , they have the property that all irreducible hypersurfaces ( divisors ) come from rational functions ( principal divisors ) .",
    "a factorial cohen - macaulay variety is automatically gorenstein ( but not conversely ) . for @xmath18 , we describe exactly when these properties hold for @xmath19 ; see example [ typea ] .    here is the main theorem of the paper :    [ maintheorem ] for any @xmath20 and any connected complex reductive algebraic group @xmath2 , the space @xmath17 is gorenstein . if the derived subgroup @xmath4 is simply connected , then @xmath17 is factorial",
    ". if the derived subgroup @xmath4 is not simply connected , there are examples where @xmath17 is not factorial , nor locally factorial .",
    "we prove the factoriality parts of the above theorem ( in arbitrary characteristic ) in section [ ufd - sec ] . as an interesting corollary",
    ", we give conditions for the picard group of the character variety to be trivial : @xmath21 if @xmath5 is simply connected .",
    "the proof of the gorenstein part of theorem [ maintheorem ] makes up the rest of the paper . as the proof uses the representation theory of algebraic groups , in section [ gor - sec ] we review the relevant ideas and build up the machinery needed for the proof which is in sections [ application - sec ] and [ gor - proof - sec ] .",
    "in the course of our proof of theorem [ maintheorem ] we also obtain similar results for the configuration space @xmath22 of @xmath23 points in the homogeneous variety @xmath24 for @xmath25 a maximal unipotent subgroup ; see theorem [ pnufdgor ] , and remark [ pngor ] .",
    "these spaces play a central role in the study of saturation problems which arise from the theory of tensor product invariants in the representation theory of @xmath2 , see e.g. section @xmath26 of @xcite .",
