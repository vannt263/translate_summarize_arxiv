    "<S> the hamiltonian considered consists of ( i )  the effective on - site interaction @xmath0 and ( ii )  the intersite charge exchange interactions @xmath1 , determining the hopping of electron pairs between nearest - neighbour sites . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of this model have been determined within the variational approach ( va ) , which treats the on - site interaction term exactly and the intersite interactions within the mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation of the general case shows that the system can exhibit not only the homogeneous phases : superconducting ( ss ) and nonordered ( no ) , but also the phase separated states ( ps : ) . depending on the values of interaction parameters , the ps state can occur in higher fields than the ss phase ( field - induced ps ) . </S>",
    "<S> some ground state results beyond the va are also presented . </S>"
