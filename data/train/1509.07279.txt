    "the primary objective of astrometry is the determination of the positions and motions of celestial objects , like stars or solar system objects , from angular observations , that is to say to trace a lightray detected by an observer back to the celestial light - source .",
    "consequently , one fundamental assignment in relativistic astrometry concerns the precise description of the trajectory of a light - signal , which is emitted by the celestial object and propagates through the gravitational field of the solar system towards the observer .",
    "the growing accuracy of observations and new observational techniques have made it necessary to take subtle relativistic effects into account . in this respect ,",
    "a breakthrough in astrometric precision has been achieved by the space - mission hipparcos ( launch : 8 august 1989 ) of european space agency ( esa ) , which has accomplished an astrometric precision of up to 1 milli - arcsecond ( @xmath1 ) in measuring the positions of stars @xcite .",
    "the next milestone in astrometry is established by the esa astrometry mission gaia ( launch : 19 december 2013 ) , where the positions of celestial objects can be determined within an accuracy of several micro - arcseconds ( ) in the ideal case ( bright stars ) @xcite .    while micro - arcsecond astrometry has been realized both theoretically and technologically within the gaia mission , the dawning of sub - micro - arcsecond ( sub- ) or even nano - arcsecond ( @xmath2 ) astrometry is going to pass into the strategic focus of astronomers .",
    "for instance , neat @xcite has been proposed to esa as a candidate for one of the m - size missions within the cosmic vision 2015 - 2025 , and is intended to reach a precision of about @xmath3 .",
    "to achieve such accuracy , neat utilizes a pair of spacecraft that would fly in formation at a separation of 40 meters .",
    "this provides the long focal length necessary to generate high angular resolution to detect earth - like planets .",
    "further space missions like astrod @xcite , lator @xcite , odyssey @xcite , sagas @xcite , or tipo @xcite are under discussion by esa which require the knowledge of light propagation through the solar system at sub-@xmath4 or even at @xmath2 level of accuracy .",
    "these missions are designed for a highly precise measurement of the spatial distance between two spacecrafts in order to determine the gravitational field within the solar system",
    ". also feasibility studies of earth - bound telescopes are presently under consideration which aim at an accuracy of about @xmath5 @xcite . in view of these technological advancements ,",
    "a corresponding development in the theory of high - precision astrometry and especially in the theory of light propagation is indispensable .    in the limit of geometrical optics",
    "the path of a light - signal ( photons ) is a null geodesic , governed by the geodesic equation which is valid in any coordinate system and reads in the exact form @xcite :    @xmath6    @xmath7    where ( [ geodetic_equation ] ) represents the geodesic equation , while the so - called isotropic condition ( [ geodetic_equation1 ] ) must be imposed as additional constraint for null geodesics ; @xmath8 are the four - coordinates of the photon which depend on the affine curve parameter @xmath9 , and the christoffel symbols are functions of the metric of curved space - time , @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the contravariant and covariant components of the metric tensor , respectively .",
    "facing the fact that in the solar system the gravitational fields are weak , @xmath13 , and the orbital velocities of the bodies are slow , @xmath14 , one is allowed for utilizing the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation for the metric tensor @xmath12 which is based on both of these assumptions ; here @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 being mass , radius , and velocity , respectively , of some massive solar system body ( e.g. , a = sun , planets , moons , planetoids ) .",
    "this so - called weak - field slow - motion approximation admits an expansion of the metric of solar system in powers of these small parameters , that means in inverse powers of the speed of light , e.g. @xcite : @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the metric tensor of flat minkowski space - time , and @xmath20 are small perturbations of it , which scale as follows , @xmath21 , while their detailed structure will be considered later .    in doing",
    "so one has to bear in mind that such a post - newtonian expansion assumes from the very beginning that all retardations are small .",
    "therefore , the expansion in ( [ metric_perturbation_2pn_5 ] ) is only valid inside the so - called near - zone of the solar system , @xmath22 , characterized by the length of gravitational waves , @xmath23 , emitted by the solar system @xcite .",
    "to get an idea about the magnitude , one can relate this wavelength to a typical orbital period @xmath24 of the solar system bodies by @xmath25 , where we have considered as orbital period one revolution of jupiter around the sun .",
    "hence , the boundary of the near - zone , @xmath26 , is still beyond the most outer border of the solar system and especially encompasses all solar system objects .",
    "since one can define the position of any object only with respect to a concrete reference system , such description necessarily implies to introduce global coordinates which cover the entire curved space - time and in respect to which the positions of the massive bodies , celestial objects and photons along their trajectories can be well - defined . according to the recommendations of the international astronomical union ( iau ) @xcite ,",
    "the standard global reference system adopted in modern astrometry is the barycentric celestial reference system ( bcrs ) with coordinates @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the coordinate - time and @xmath29 are cartesian - like spatial coordinates from the origin of the global system ( barycenter of the solar system ) to some field - point .    in bcrs coordinates the exact light - trajectory from the light - source through the solar system towards the observer , that means the exact solution of geodesic equation ( [ geodetic_equation ] ) , can be written as follows , @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the position of the light - source at the moment @xmath32 of emission of the light - signal , @xmath33 is the unit - direction of the lightray at past - null infinity , and @xmath34 are gravitational corrections to the unperturbed light - trajectory .",
    "these corrections are complicated expressions which depend on all parameters which characterize the metric of the solar system . according to the post - newtonian expansion ( [ metric_perturbation_2pn_5 ] )",
    ", the gravitational corrections to the unperturbed light - trajectory admit a corresponding expansion , @xmath35    where the 1pn terms @xmath36 , the 1.5pn terms @xmath37 , and the 2pn terms @xmath38 are of the order @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .    as aforementioned ,",
    "todays astrometric accuracy has reached a level of a few micro - arcseconds in angular observations , and the next scale of precision is the sub - micro - arcsecond level ; for a historical survey see @xcite . in order to analyse such highly precise astrometric data , a comprehensive and systematic relativistic procedure of data - reduction",
    "is required @xcite . among several aspects of modern astrometry",
    ", two specific issues have carefully to be treated :    * ( a ) * first , the most fundamental concept in astrometric data reduction concerns the accurate definition of a set of several reference systems plus the coordinate transformations among them . in particular , for the determination of the light - trajectory through the solar system ( @xmath0-body system ) ,",
    "the following @xmath0 + 1 coordinate systems are of primary importance : one global reference system ( bcrs ) with coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath0 local coordinate systems with coordinates @xmath42 , one for each massive body ( @xmath43 ) and co - moving with it .",
    "these @xmath0 + 1 reference systems are fully defined by the form of their metric tensor .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known , that the global metric ( [ metric_perturbation_2pn_5 ] ) of a @xmath0-body system in the region exterior of the massive bodies admits a decomposition into two families of global multipoles , namely global mass - multipoles @xmath44 and global spin - multipoles @xmath45 @xcite : @xmath46    these global multipoles describe the multipole - structure of the entire solar system as a whole . on the other side , from the theory of reference systems and in accordance with the iau resolutions @xcite",
    ", it is clear that physically meaningful multipole moments of some massive body a have to be defined in the body s local reference system , namely local ( also called intrinsic ) mass - multipoles @xmath47 and local spin - multipoles @xmath48 .",
    "these intrinsic multipoles describe the multipole - structure of each individual body separately .",
    "consequently , the problem arises about how to express the global metric ( [ metric_perturbation_2pn_5 ] ) in terms of local multipoles : @xmath49    in this respect , there are two advanced approaches in the relativistic theory of reference systems : the _ brumberg - kopeikin _ formalism ( bk ) @xcite and the _ damour - soffel - xu _ approach ( dsx ) @xcite .",
    "both these approaches coincide for all practical problems in celestial mechanics and astrometry @xcite and have become a part of the iau resolutions @xcite .",
    "thus it appears that the explicit form of the metric perturbations @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in ( [ expansion_b ] ) are well - established expressions in celestial mechanics and modern astrometry , while the spatial components @xmath53 in ( [ expansion_b ] ) deserve special attention in case of extended bodies with full multipole structure and is presently an active field of research @xcite ; note that @xmath54 .    *",
    "( b ) * second , the solar system can be described as an isolated @xmath0-body system , where the bodies move under the influence of their mutual gravitational interaction , therewith associated are orbital motions of the bodies which are highly complicated .",
    "one has to be aware that the metric ( [ metric_perturbation_2pn_5 ] ) and , therefore , the light - trajectory ( [ introduction_5 ] ) are functions of these complicated worldlines @xmath55 of the massive bodies . in order to simplify this problem , one might want to expand the worldline of some body a around some time - moment @xmath56 as follows , @xmath57    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the position , velocity and acceleration of body a at time - moment @xmath56 , respectively , which are constant parameters .",
    "while terms like @xmath61 are beyond 1pn approximation in the geodesic equation , one has to realize that the above series expansion is not an expansion in powers over @xmath62 , thus all terms in ( [ worldline_introduction ] ) will contribute in 1pn approximation to the lightray metric , at least as long as no further assumptions like @xmath63 are asserted ; cf .",
    "text below eq .",
    "( [ global_metric_perturbation_c ] ) . in principle , the expression in ( [ worldline_introduction ] ) can be implemented into the metric tensor of the solar system in ( [ metric_perturbation_2pn_5 ] ) .",
    "but such an approach leads rapidly to involved integrals when solving the geodesic equation in ( [ geodetic_equation ] ) , and implies actually an infinite series of integrals that apparently can not be summed .",
    "also the time - moment @xmath56 is actually an open parameter and remains uncertain without further assumptions .",
    "consequently , instead to apply for such an approximative expansion in ( [ worldline_introduction ] ) , it is much preferable to find a solution for the light - trajectory in terms of arbitrary worldlines @xmath55 .",
    "the actual worldline of some massive body can finally be concretized by means of solar system ephemerides ; e.g. the jpl de421 @xcite . accordingly , an important point which has carefully to be considered concerns the arbitrary motion of the massive bodies .    in this investigation",
    "we will account for both of these fundamental aspects adressed above : issue * ( a ) * is incorporated by the _ dsx approach _",
    ", while issue * ( b ) * is accounted for by _ integration by parts of geodesic equation _ plus the evidence that the remnants of this procedure represent terms beyond 1pn approximation . in this way",
    ", a systematic approach is developed in order to determine the light - trajectory in the solar system in ( [ introduction_5 ] ) in the first post - newtonian approximation ( 1pn approximation ) , @xmath64    where the global metric of the solar system is described from the very beginning in terms of intrinsic multipoles of the extended bodies in arbitrary motion .",
    "such a systematic formalism is an imperative prerequisite for extending the model to higher - order terms in the post - newtonian expansion in ( [ introduction_6 ] ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ section1 ] we will motivate the inevitability for an analytical solution of light - trajectory in the field of @xmath0 arbitrarily moving bodies with full multipole structure in post - newtonian order for sub - micro - arcsecond astrometry . in section [ section2 ] the geodesic equation in 1pn approximation and the initial - boundary conditions are introduced which determine an unique solution of the geodesic equation .",
    "the metric of the solar system in terms of intrinsic multipoles in accordance with the iau resolutions is given in section [ section4 ] . in order to simplify the integration procedure ,",
    "new variables for space and time and the corresponding transformation of geodesic equation and metric tensor are presented in section [ section3 ] . in section [ first_integration ] the first integration of geodesic equation",
    "is performed , while in section [ special_cases_1 ] some specific cases ( arbitrarily moving monopoles , dipoles , quadrupoles , and one body at rest with full multipole structure ) are considered .",
    "it will be demonstrated that in the limit of bodies at rest the results are in agreement with known results in the literature . in section [ second_integration ] the second integration of geodesic equation",

    "expressions for the observable relativistic effects of time - delay and light - deflection are given in section [ observable_effects ] .",
    "a summary and outlook can be found in section [ summary_outlook ] .",
    "it appears to be considerate to introduce the notation in use regarding the impact vectors , while further notations are shifted to appendix [ notation ] .",
    "while the exact lightray @xmath65 in ( [ introduction_5 ] ) is a complicated function , the unperturbed lightray in flat minkowski space - time is just given by a straight line : @xmath66    where the subscript n stands for newtonian limit .",

    "\\(iii ) one has also to realize that ( [ worldline_summary ] ) is not an expansion in inverse powers of the speed of light , hence these terms are not necessarily beyond 1pn approximation of geodesic equation .",
    "these facts make it much preferable to determine the light - trajectory as function of arbitrary worldlines @xmath55 , that means to determine the light - trajectory in the field of arbitrarily moving massive bodies .",
    "the actual worldline of the massive bodies can finally be concretized and implemented by some solar system ephemerides ; e.g. the jpl de421 @xcite .",

    "furthermore , it has been shown that the results presented agree in special cases with well - established results in the literature , namely monopoles , quadrupoles , and arbitrarily shaped bodies at rest as well as monopoles in arbitrary motion .",
