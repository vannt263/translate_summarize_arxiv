    "the emergence of coherent rotating structures from disordered flows is a central feature of 2d classical turbulence @xcite . in two - dimensional quantum turbulence ( 2dqt )",
    "@xcite , the analogous phenomenon involves large - scale clustering of quantum vortices of the same sign of circulation ; such clustering can occur in negative temperature equilibrium states  @xcite , and as a result of a turbulent inverse - energy cascade induced by small - scale forcing  @xcite .",
    "the characterization of such clustered vortex states , which tend to be highly disordered arrangements of same - sign vortices , poses a theoretical challenge of recent interest @xcite . in many respects ,",
    "these states strongly contrast with a rotating superfluid in its ground state , which will form a regular abrikosov lattice comprised of co - rotating vortices , exhibiting a sixfold rotational symmetry , and obeying feynman s rule of constant areal vortex density @xcite . although the velocity field of the superfluid is formally curl - free , the velocity field of a large lattice approaches that of rigid - body rotation under appropriate coarse - graining over many vortex cores  @xcite , as required by bohr s correspondence principle .",
    "furthermore , the self - similar expansion of the atomic density of a 3d turbulent cloud  @xcite can be modelled by introducing a rotational velocity field  @xcite , suggesting that the development of a _ rotational _ velocity field in an _ irrotational _ superfluid may be a fundamental property of quantum turbulence . in the context of the negative temperature states arising as the end states of decaying 2dqt @xcite",
    ", these considerations motivate the question : _ what kind of rotational velocity field emerges in the interior of a large , coherent vortex cluster ? _    in this work",
    "we address the problem of characterizing emergent coherent vortex structures in a 2d bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , a compressible superfluid , with an emphasis on experimentally accessible measures .",
    "while measurements of vortex locations and circulations  @xcite , or of two - point velocity correlations would allow inference of the _ classical _ ( point - vortex - like ) energy spectrum  @xcite , neither the vortex circulations , nor the velocity correlations are easily accessed in current 2dqt experiments @xcite .",
    "these difficulties motivate an exploration of other measures that may be more easily accessible . here",
    ", we consider information contained in the quantum kinetic energy spectrum of the quantum fluid ; provided interactions can be suppressed using , for example , an appropriate feshbach resonance , this information may be readily available in experiments via ballistic expansion @xcite .",
    "we develop a link between the quantum kinetic energy spectrum over wavenumber @xmath0 and the superfluid velocity probability distribution , and show analytically that a spectrum @xmath2 in the infrared arises from the coherent quantum vortex structures emerging in negative - temperature vortex configurations .",
    "we show analytically that such a spectrum can correspond to rigid - body rotation , extending to a scale determined by the size of the coherent vortex structures , and , additionally , can arise due to quadrupole velocity fields resulting from the interaction between the coherent structures and the superfluid boundary .",
    "we numerically sample vortex configurations over a range of energies , exploring a number of measures with which to characterize the vortex distributions .",
    "we verify the emergence of a @xmath1 spectrum and demonstrate that the coherent structures produce a well - defined peak in the quantum kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "this peak can be quantitatively understood by considering the largest vortex structures .",
    "we further find that the largest structures exhibit a constant areal vortex density , and conclude that the clustered states that emerge in negative - temperature configurations obey feynman s rule while being spatially disordered .",
    "we consider the outlook for observing quasi - classical coherent vortex structures in atomic bec experiments .",
    "dynamical simulations of a trapped bec ( within the damped gross - pitaevskii description ) show that , for well - chosen non - equilibrium vortex configurations that may be accessible via laser - stirring protocols  @xcite , the resulting vortex dynamics can form long - lived , high - energy coherent vortex structures despite some loss of energy to sound .",

    "we remark that the quantum spectra may resemble the classical spectra in regimes where the phase @xmath42 is approximately constant over large regions of the system , for example in the vortex - dipole gas regime  @xcite ( see also sec .",
