    "a first aim of this paper is to produce refinements of the quantum hyperbolic invariants ( qhi ) of hyperbolic cusped @xmath0-manifolds ( defined in @xcite , extending @xcite ) .",
    "but our thesis is that such refinements are instances of a sort of `` universal '' phenomenon concerning the quantum invariants of @xmath0-manifolds based on some theory of @xmath5-symbols and defined by means of state sums over triangulations .",
    "at least this holds for every example to our knowledge ( for instance the family of generalized turaev - viro invariants based on the @xmath5-symbols of any unimodular category , constructed in @xcite ) .",
    "the arguments of these new invariants , that we call _ reduced invariants _ , are the same as those of the  unreduced \" ones , but they apply to @xmath0-manifolds equipped with an additional _ non ambiguous structure _ , a new type of combinatorial structure on compact oriented @xmath0-manifolds that we introduce and investigate , pointing out in particular a strong relationship with the theory of taut triangulations .",
    "let us describe qualitatively this phenomenon .",
    "@xmath8 there is a `` background theory '' , usually given by a category of finite dimensional representations of a hopf algebra ; the  @xmath5-symbols \" of the theory can be organized at first to produce a kind of `` basic tensor '' , that is , linear isomorphisms @xmath9 carried by an oriented @xmath0-simplex equipped with a further `` decoration '' , say @xmath10 , dictated by the background theory .",
    "usually the @xmath11 are complex vector spaces of the same dimension .",
    "a @xmath0-simplex is a tetrahedron @xmath12 with ordered vertices @xmath13 ; this can be encoded by a system @xmath14 of edge orientations ( called a _ ( local ) branching _ ) such that there are @xmath15-incoming edges at the vertex @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17-faces @xmath18 of @xmath19 are ordered accordingly with the opposite vertices @xmath16 , and we associate to the face @xmath18 the space @xmath11 .",
    "this is the basic use of the branching to associate the tensor @xmath20 to @xmath19 . but",
    "depending on the background theory , there are further subtler uses concerning the decoration @xmath10 . for example , in quantum hyperbolic theory an ingredient of the decoration is a triple of _ shape parameters _ , which are scalars in @xmath21 , associated to the triple of couples of opposite edges .",
    "these naturally occur with a _ cyclic ordering _ depending on the orientation of @xmath12 .",
    "the branching @xmath14 is used to select one _ linear _ ordering compatible with the cyclic one .",
    "@xmath8 given a triangulation @xmath22 of some compact oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 , we give each oriented tetrahedron @xmath12 of @xmath22 a branching and a decoration , so that the system formed by such local data verifies certain _ global constraints _ ( also dictated by the background theory ) .",
    "for example , for what concerns the local branchings we could require that the edge orientations of the tetrahedra match under the @xmath17-face pairings in @xmath22 , to produce a _ global branching _",
    "@xmath14 of @xmath22 .",
    "this is equivalent to promote @xmath22 to be a @xmath12-complex ( a generalized simplicial complex ) , a kind of object familiar in algebraic topology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but it turns out that this is too demanding . on another hand ,",
    "every oriented @xmath0-simplex @xmath19 carries a weaker structure , that is , a system of transverse co - orientations of its @xmath17-faces such that two co - orientations are incoming and two are outgoing .",
    "we call it the local _ pre - branching _",
    "@xmath23 induced by the branching @xmath14 .",
    "we say that a system @xmath24 of local branchings of the tetrahedra of @xmath22 is a _",
    "weak branching _ if their @xmath17-face co - orientations match under the @xmath17-face pairings , and we call such a system @xmath25 of co - orientations a global _ pre - branching _ of @xmath22 .",
    "pre - branchings occur , for instance , in the definition of taut triangulations @xcite .",
    "but one eventually realizes that the notion of pre - branching is also the most fundamental global enhancement of @xmath0-manifold triangulations in order to deal with `` quantum state sums '' ( for any background theory ) . given a weakly branched triangulation @xmath26 endowed with a global decoration , say @xmath27",
    ", we get a _ tensor network _ by associating the above basic tensor @xmath28 to every decorated @xmath0-simplex @xmath29 of @xmath30 .",
    "the state sum @xmath31 is by definition the _ total contraction _ of this network .",
    "we call it a _ reduced _ ( or basic ) state sum of the theory",
    ".    @xmath8 in order to obtain invariants of the @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 ( possibly equipped with additional structures , as it happens in quantum hyperbolic theory ) by means of such state sums , we have to mod out the arbitrary choices we have made , in particular the choice of the weak branching @xmath24 .",
    "this gives rise to a more or less delicate procedure of _ symmetrization _ of the basic tensors , producing tensors of the same type , say @xmath32 , such that the corresponding state sums ( ie .",
    "network total contraction ) @xmath33 have the required invariance properties .",
    "@xmath8 one might wonder anyway whether the reduced state sums @xmath31 define some kind of @xmath0-dimensional invariant .",
    "for example it holds that , keeping the decoration @xmath27 fixed , the value of @xmath31 depends only on the underlying pre - branching @xmath25 , not on @xmath24 itself .",
    "moreover , the state sums verify a highly non trivial system of functional identities which apparently is formally the same for every background theory ; this system corresponds to a restricted system of `` moves '' on pre - branched triangulations , called _ non ambiguous transits_. then the notion of _ non ambiguous structure _ on @xmath2 arises as an equivalence class of pre - branched triangulations of @xmath2 up to non ambiguous transits .    in order to substantiate our thesis , in the present paper we spell out the case of the quantum hyperbolic state sums , and in the appendix , the most fundamental prototype of this business , the turaev - viro state sums @xcite .",
    "having in mind this strong motivation ( at least in our opinion ) , the theory of non ambiguous structures can be introduced and developed by itself , without any reference to any specific @xmath5-symbols theory .",
    "it is remarkable nevertheless that in doing it , some issues of the quantum hyperbolic machinery emerge .",
    "we will develop two instances of non ambiguous structures ; the most important is based on _ ideal _ triangulations of @xmath0-manifolds that are the interior of compact connected oriented @xmath0-manifolds @xmath2 with non empty boundary ( sections 2 to 6 ) ; the other is based on relative `` distinguished triangulations '' @xmath34 of @xmath35 , where @xmath2 is a compact closed oriented @xmath0-manifold and @xmath36 is a non empty link in @xmath2 ( section [ ml ] ) .    in the rest of this introduction",
    "we describe more features of the non ambiguous structures ( sections [ on - id - na ] and [ on - rel - na ] ) and our results about reduced quantum hyperbolic invariants ( section [ on - red - qhi ] ) .",
    "after some generalities on @xmath0-manifold triangulations and the different notions of `` branchings '' ( section [ triang ] ) , the combinatorial definition of ideal non ambiguous structures is given in section [ nais ] .",
    "we prefer to consider an ideal triangulation @xmath22 of int@xmath37 as a triangulation of the compact space @xmath38 obtained by adding a point at infinity at each end of int@xmath37 , requiring that the set of vertices of @xmath22 coincides with the set of these added points .",
    "these `` naked '' ideal triangulations are considered up to the equivalence relation generated by the well known @xmath39 ( mp ) and @xmath40 ( lune ) moves .",
    "dealing with ideal pre - branched triangulations @xmath41 , there are natural notions of @xmath42-_transits _ that enhance the above naked moves . roughly speaking , a @xmath42-transit @xmath43 is `` non ambiguous '' if both the transit and its inverse @xmath44 are the unique @xmath42-enhancements of the underlying naked move with the given initial configuration .",
    "once the combinatorial definition has been established , our effort is to point out some _ intrinsic geometric topological content _ and natural families of ( ideal ) non ambiguous structures .    in section [ seccharges ]",
    "we remark that the non ambiguous structures on @xmath2 have an intrinsic cohomological content , strictly related to the theory of charges and `` cohomological weights '' which play an important role in the definition of the qhi for hyperbolic cusped manifolds .    in section [ 2d ]",
    "we develop a partial , though rather illuminating ,  holographic \" approach to the non ambiguous structures on @xmath2 , based on a suitably defined restriction of the @xmath45 structures on @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , we discover that these @xmath47 structures carry certain _ singular combings _ on @xmath3 ( defined in intrinsic geometric topological terms ) that are eventually invariants of the @xmath45 structures .",
    "a conjectural holographic classification of ideal non ambiguous structures is given in conjecture [ ricconj ] .",
    "when @xmath3 is a collection of tori , as for hyperbolic cusped @xmath0-manifolds , we easily realize that the ( possibly empty ) set of _ taut _ pre - branched ideal triangulations @xmath41 of @xmath38 in the sense of @xcite is closed with respect to the non ambiguous transits .",
    "we call _ taut structures _ the corresponding non ambiguous structures .",
    "if @xmath2 is realized as a mapping torus @xmath48 ( @xmath49 being an automorphism of a punctured surface @xmath50 with @xmath51 , considered up to isotopy ) , or more generally if @xmath2 carries a _ sutured manifold hierarchy _ @xmath52 ( which exists for example when @xmath2 is a hyperbolic cusped manifold ) , then one finds in @xcite a procedure to construct taut triangulations @xmath41 of @xmath38 which depend on @xmath48 or @xmath52 and also on other arbitrary choices .",
    "for example in the case of @xmath48 these choices are an ideal triangulation of a fiber , say @xmath53 , and a sequence of elementary diagonal exchanges ( `` flips '' ) that connects @xmath53 with @xmath54 ; with these data one constructs a so called taut `` layered '' ideal triangulation of @xmath55 .",
    "one eventually realizes that these further choices are immaterial up to non ambiguous transits , and that we have the following result ( see section [ taut ] ) .",
    "let us call `` thurston ball of @xmath2 '' the unit ball of the thurston norm on @xmath56 .",
    "[ existna ] ( 1 ) every mapping torus @xmath48 with punctured fibre of negative euler characteristic carries a natural taut structure @xmath57 , represented by any layered triangulation , constructed by means of any ideal triangulation of a fiber .",
    "\\(2 ) assume that @xmath2 fibers over @xmath4 .",
    "then , any two fibrations of @xmath2 such that the corresponding mapping tori @xmath48 and @xmath58 satisfy @xmath59 lie in the cone over a same face of the thurston ball of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , mapping tori corresponding to fibrations lying on a same ray from the origin of @xmath60 satisfy @xmath59 .",
    "\\(3 ) more generally , every compact oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 with non empty boundary equipped with a sutured manifold hierarchy @xmath52 carries a natural taut structure @xmath61 .    in the simpler case when @xmath2 fibres over @xmath4 , it can happen that different ( non multiple ) fibrations carry the same non ambiguous structure .",
    "an interesting case is provided by the following theorem which easily follows from a result of agol @xcite . for completeness",
    "we will discuss the proof in section [ taut ] .",
    "[ agol ] to every couple @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a complete hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold of finite volume that fibres over @xmath4 and @xmath64 is a fibred face of the thurston ball of @xmath63 , one can associate in a canonical way a couple @xmath65 , where @xmath2 is cusped manifold ( obtained by removing a suitable link from @xmath63 ) and @xmath66 is a fibred face of the thurston ball of @xmath2 , such that all fibrations @xmath48 of @xmath2 in the cone over @xmath66 define the same taut structure . hence the taut structure @xmath67 is well defined .",
    "in general , for any oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 bounded by tori and which fibers over @xmath4 , theorem [ existna ] ( 2 ) implies that for every fibred face @xmath64 of the thurston ball of @xmath2 , there is a well defined map @xmath68 which associate to any rational point @xmath69 the taut structure @xmath70 where @xmath49 is the monodromy of any fibration of @xmath2 in the ray spanned by @xmath71 .",
    "a very attractive and probably demanding problem is to study this map in general .",
    "for example , we can state    \\(1 ) is @xmath68 always constant ? ( 2 ) otherwise , is the image of @xmath68 always finite ?      dealing with not necessarily ideal triangulations of @xmath38 , for example when @xmath2 is closed , we must complete the naked triangulation moves with the so called @xmath40 _ bubble _ move , which modifies the number of vertices ( see section [ ml ] ) .",
    "looking at the associated @xmath42-transits we realize that none is `` non ambiguous '' in a strict sense .",
    "we need some further input to select one",
    ". we can do it in the framework of relative _ distinguished triangulations _",
    "@xmath34 of @xmath35 , qualified by the fact that @xmath72 is a hamiltonian subcomplex of the @xmath73-skeleton of @xmath22 isotopic to the link @xmath36 .",
    "these are considered up to relative `` distinguished '' versions of the naked moves ( bubble move included ) .",
    "this kind of triangulation has been already used to define qhi for pairs @xmath35 . in section [ ml ]",
    "we develop the relative non ambiguous structures somewhat in parallel to what we have done in the case of ideal triangulations .",
    "in particular we will introduce the notion of _ relative taut structure _ and indicate some procedures to construct examples .",
    "let us ouline now some specific features of the _ reduced _ quantum hyperbolic invariants .",
    "although the qhi can be defined in more general situations ( see @xcite ) , in this paper we focus on two main instances of compact oriented @xmath0-manifolds : _ cusped manifolds _",
    "such that the non empty boundary is made by tori and the interior has a finite volume complete hyperbolic structure ( see @xcite ) ; pairs @xmath35 , where @xmath2 is closed , @xmath36 is a non empty link in @xmath2 , and @xmath2 is equipped with a @xmath1-character ( see @xcite ) . in such situations , for every odd integer @xmath74",
    "the qhi of @xmath2 or @xmath35 at _ level @xmath75 _ is a complex number defined up to multiplication by @xmath76th - roots of unity .",
    "let us assume for a while that @xmath2 is a cusped manifold .",
    "then its qhi depend on a choice of conjugacy class @xmath77 of representations of @xmath78 in @xmath79 , and two pairs of so called _ bulk _ and _ boundary weights _ @xmath80 and @xmath81 given by cohomology classes @xmath82 satisfying certain natural compatibility conditions . in particular , @xmath83 mod@xmath84 , where the map @xmath85 is the inclusion ; @xmath86 encodes a sort of `` logarithm '' of the class in @xmath87 ( with multiplicative coefficients ) defined by the restriction of @xmath77 on @xmath46 .",
    "also , we assume that when int(@xmath2 ) has one cusp , @xmath77 varies in the irreducible component @xmath88 of the variety of @xmath79-characters of @xmath2 containing the character of the discrete faithful holonomy @xmath89 ; if there are several cusps , @xmath88 has to be replaced by its so called _ eigenvalue _ subvariety ( see @xcite for this notion ) .",

    "hence :      so the reduced tv invariants are completely blind with respect to the taut structures ( though they can distinguish other non ambiguous structures on @xmath2 ) .",
    "this can be regarded as a tv counterpart of the fact that the qhi symmetrization factors @xmath1366 , whenever @xmath169 is a taut triangulation and @xmath97 is the tautological charge carried by @xmath169 .",
    "the advantage of the qh framework is that we can vary also the @xmath97-weight @xmath133 in order to distinguish different taut structures , as we have done in section [ examples ] .    on the other hand , recall that",
    "the normalized qh symmetry defects are blind with respect to the relative non ambiguous structures on @xmath35 .",
