    "@xcite , thz emission from intense two - color pulses was initially attributed to optical rectification via third - order nonlinearity .",
    "however , it was shown later that the plasma built - up by tunneling photoionization is necessary to explain the high amplitudes of the thz field @xcite , and a quasi - dc plasma current generated by the temporally asymmetric two - color field is responsible for thz emission  @xcite .",
    "plasma oscillations leading to strong thz radiation were also reported for single color pump pulses with few - cycle duration or at higher intensities  @xcite .",
    "apart from energy scaling @xcite and polarization control @xcite , tailoring the shape of the broadband radiated thz pulse is one of the standing goals with respect to applications . in the case of two - color filaments in air",
    "it was already demonstrated experimentally that the geometry of the plasma channels and the initial carrier envelope phase of the laser pulse can be used to control the thz waveform  @xcite .",
    "it was also recently suggested to control thz generation in gases by more involved spectral engineering of the ir pump pulse , i.e. , by modifying the temporal positions of the electric field maxima resp .",
    "ionization events @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges on the route towards thz spectral control is to understand the influence of the complicated nonlinear propagation dynamics of the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "it is known that ionizing femtosecond laser pulses undergo strong spatiotemporal modifications during propagation , and that these propagation effects have a tremendous impact on the emitted thz fields  @xcite . moreover , shortly after the onset of thz generation the gas atoms or molecules and ionized electrons are exposed to the co - propagating low - frequency field as well . in particular because asymmetrically ionized gases were already successfully used for remote detection of thz fields through coherent manipulation of the ionized electron drift velocity and subsequent collision - induced fluorescence emission  @xcite , we can suspect to find a self - action mechanism of already generated thz radiation on the thz generation itself .",
    "in the present work we will shed light onto the pulse propagation effects in the plasma , and the interaction of the generated terahertz field with the ionized medium .",
    "our starting point is a semi - analytic model developed in  @xcite based on the local current ( lc ) approximation , i.e. , considering a small volume of gas irradiated by the ionizing field .",
