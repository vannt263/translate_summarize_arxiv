    "a fundamental goal in modern astronomy is to learn more about the origin and evolution of the solar system and other planetary environments where life may exist .",
    "circumstellar dust around main sequence stars was discovered with iras ( aumann et al . 1984 ) and has been studied extensively to learn indirectly about the origin and evolution of larger parent bodies which might resemble asteroids or comets ( lagrange , backman & artymowicz 2000 ; zuckerman 2001 ) .",
    "to date , however , very little is directly known about these parent bodies .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe an observational strategy to identify and characterize individual extrasolar comets .",
    "water - rich asteroids and comets are probably responsible for delivering to the earth most of its water ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2000 ) . by studying comets and related objects around young stars",
    ", it may be possible to learn more about this process which is fundamental for the development of life as we know it .",
    "there have been a number of previous discussions about possible observational signatures of comets around other stars .",
    "alcock , fristrom & siegelman ( 1986 ) suggested that the presence of metals in the atmospheres of white dwarfs could be explained by the collision of comets with the star , but this hypothesis is not yet supported by additional evidence ( see zuckerman et al .",
    "melnick et al . ( 2001 ) detected gas - phase h@xmath2o in the outflow from irc+10216 , a carbon - rich mass - losing red giant , which they interpreted as being produced by the sublimation of comets ( stern , shull & brandt 1990 , ford & neufeld 2001 ) .",
    "however , the observed water might result from chemical reactions in the dense outflow ( willacy 2004 ) . jura ( 2004 ) has argued that the lack of excess 25 @xmath3 m radiation in iras data for first ascent red giants means that these stars typically have less than 0.1 m@xmath4 of comet - like kuiper belt objects in orbits at @xmath5 45 au .",
    "there is compelling evidence for falling evaporating bodies ( feb s ) around @xmath6 pic , a 12 myr - old star ( barrado",
    "y navascues et al . 1999 , zuckerman et al . 2001 ) with a substantial amount of circumstellar dust ( artymowicz 1997 , vidal - madjar , lecavelier des etangs & ferlet 1998 ) .",
    "transient absorption lines which can be attributed to infalling planetesimal also have been detected around other young a - type stars ( see , for example , grady et al .",
    "1996 , roberge et al .",
    "although lecavelier des etangs , vidal - madjar & ferlet ( 1996 ) and li & greenberg ( 1998 ) have proposed that much of the dust around @xmath6 pic arises from comets , the observed feb s contain a substantial amount of refractory material , and their degree of resemblance to ice - rich comets in the solar system is uncertain ( karmann , beust & klinger 2001 , 2003 , thebault , augereau & beust 2003 ) .",
    "there are very substantial uncertainties regarding the oort belt comets in the solar system .",
    "estimates of the total mass in this region range from 0.6 m@xmath4 ( stern & weissman 2001 ) to 40 m@xmath4 weissman ( 1996 ) , while there are a factor of 100 fewer observed  dormant \" comets than predicted with the simplest models ( levison et al .",
    "2002 ) .    given the major unknowns , in this paper we describe schematic rather than detailed models .",
    "we consider the production of gas - phase absorptions in the observed spectra of main sequence stars caused by transiting comets which are warm enough that water - ice sublimates ( see beust , karmann & lagrange 2001 ) .",
    "previously , the effects of the photometric variations by cometary dust have been computed by lamers , lecavelier des etangs & ferlet ( 1997 ) and lecavelier des etangs , vidal - madjar & ferlet ( 1999 ) ; here , we consider the possibility of detecting comets by their spectral line absorptions ( see also smith , black & oppenheimer 1981 ) .",
    "we show results for oh because it is abundantly produced in comets and because it can be detected from the ground .",
    "following whipple & huebner ( 1976 ) and festou ( 1981 ) , we adopt a simple model for the gaseous outflow from comets .",
    "when a comet approaches its host star , the ice is sublimated , and subsequently the gas - phase h@xmath2o is photodissociated mainly into oh and h : @xmath7 the resulting oh is mainly photodissociated into o and h : @xmath8 finally , the o and h atoms are ionized , typically by charge exchange with the wind particles from the host star .",
    "below , we compute the spatial distribution of the oh molecules .",
    "we assume that the comet has an active area , @xmath9 , and lies at a distance , @xmath10 , from the host star .",
    "[ we use capital and small letters to denote locations and speeds in the coordinate system centered on the host star and comet , respectively .",
    "] we assume that the comet has a single surface temperature , and we focus on the parameter regime where the comet is sufficiently hot that cooling by ice sublimation balances heating by radiation from the host star and radiative cooling from the comet is relatively unimportant .",
    "if @xmath11 is the average energy required to remove a water molecule from the comet , and @xmath12 denotes the luminosity of the host star , then the rate of production of h@xmath2o molecules , @xmath13 , is given by : @xmath14 the sublimation energy of pure water ice at 0 k is 7.6 @xmath0 10@xmath15 erg / molecule ( for example , ford & neufeld 2001 ) .",
    "however , not all of the incident stellar energy is converted into ice removal .",
    "we adopt @xmath11 = 2.0 @xmath0 10@xmath16 erg / molecule , approximately the result given by sekanina ( 2002 ) for the erosion energy of sun - grazing comets . with equation ( 3 ) and our adopted value of @xmath11 , we reproduce within a factor of 2 , the rates of h@xmath2o and oh production given by ahearn et al .",

    "the comet with the largest measured outflow was hale - bopp where the water molecule production rate at 1 au was approximately 1.0 @xmath0 10@xmath17 s@xmath18 ( dello russo et al .",

    "this assumption fails for comet temperatures below @xmath5200 k , depending upon various physical parameters such as the infrared emissivity of the comet , the penetration of light into the comet s nucleus and the exact composition of the comet ( whipple & huebner 1976 ) . here , for simplicity , we assume that sublimation from the comet follows equation ( 3 ) only if its distance from the host star is less than an outer radius , @xmath21 ; otherwise we assume no sublimation . for numerical purposes ,",
    "we take @xmath21 = 2 au .    in writing equation ( 3 ) , we assume that the sublimation rate from the comet does not depend upon whether it is inward - bound or outward - bound . this description is appropriate for many solar system comets ( see whipple & huebner 1976 and ahearn et al .",
    "1995 ) , and given the many other unknowns , this seems like the appropriate approximation for the models presented here .",
    "once the water is ejected from the comet , we assume a radial outflow with a speed , @xmath22 . for most comets , @xmath22 @xmath23 1 km s@xmath18 , but for comet",
    "hale - bopp , @xmath22 was approximately 3 km s@xmath18 since the gas was substantially heated as it left the comet s nucleus ( harris et al .",
    "because we are most interested in the unusually massive comets like hale - bopp , we use @xmath22 = 3 km s@xmath18 in our numerical examples .",

    "if we define @xmath34 as the density of oh , then : @xmath35 by writing equation ( 6 ) , we ignore the relatively small amount of water that is photodissociated into o and h@xmath2 .",
    "we define @xmath36 = @xmath37 , and as long as @xmath36 @xmath38 @xmath29 , the solution to equation ( 6 ) is : @xmath39 with @xmath22 = 3 km s@xmath18 and @xmath40(1 au ) = 7.5 @xmath0 10@xmath41 s@xmath18 ( schleicher & ahearn 1988 , harris et al . 2002 ) , then @xmath36 = 4 @xmath0 10@xmath33 cm .",
    "the oh photodissociation rate is a function of solar activity and can vary by a factor of 2 ( budzien , festou & feldman 1994 , van dishoeck & dalgarno 1984 ) .",
    "close to the comet where both @xmath25 @xmath42 @xmath29 and @xmath25 @xmath42 @xmath36 , we find from equation ( 7 ) that : @xmath43 the column density of oh , @xmath44 , along the line of sight with impact parameter @xmath45 relative to the comet s nucleus can be found with the assumptions that @xmath46 is given by equation ( 8) for @xmath25 @xmath47 @xmath29 and it is  small \" for @xmath25 @xmath48 @xmath29 .",
    "thus , for @xmath45 @xmath42 @xmath29 , @xmath49 since @xmath13 varies as @xmath50 and @xmath29 varies as @xmath51 , then @xmath44 varies approximately as @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 is sensitive to the comet s orbital distance , @xmath10 , from the host star .",
    "we show in figure 1 the oh column density as a function of displacement from an analog to hale - bopp for an assumed distance from the sun of 1 au and @xmath22 = 3 km s@xmath18 .",
    "we consider both a case with standard ultraviolet dissociation rates , and a case where @xmath40 and @xmath31 are increased by a factor of 10 . in the standard case ,",
    "the oh cloud is more extended and , for small values of @xmath45 , the column density of oh is relatively low compared to the case with high ultraviolet intensity .    our results for @xmath44",
    "allow us to determine where the oh is optically thin .",
    "as might be expected from pumping models for the populatons of the energy levels such as those described by schleicher & ahearn ( 1988 ) , an oh energy level might contain at most 10% of all the oh molecules .",
    "then , as seen in figure 1 , even in the case of high ultraviolet radiation , its maximum column density is less than @xmath55 @xmath0 10@xmath53 @xmath54 . since the oh lines near 3100  typically have oscillator strengths near 10@xmath55 ( roueff 1996 ) , then with @xmath22 = 3 km s@xmath18 , these oh lines are optically thin .",
    "however , for @xmath10 @xmath47 1 au , the oh region is more compact and the lines rapidly become optically thick as @xmath10 decreases .",
    "the comet s orbit around the star , @xmath56 , is given by the expression : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the distance at periastron , @xmath59 is the orbital eccentricity and @xmath60 is the angle measured between the major axis of the orbit s ellipse and the host star . the comet s specific angular momentum , @xmath61 , equals @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the tangential speed of the comet . if the mass of the star is @xmath64 , we can write that : @xmath65gm_{*}r_{p})^{1/2}\\ ] ]",
    "we now compute the absorption produced by the oh cloud around a comet .      for the conditions of most interest , we expect that the size of the comet s oh cloud is smaller than the host star s radius . in this case , we only need to compute the total number of oh molecules produced in the outflow from a comet , @xmath66",
    ". we may use equation ( 7 ) to find that : @xmath67 equation ( 12 ) shows that @xmath66 is independent of the comet s distance to its host star because both the water production rate ( @xmath13 ) and the oh photodissociation rate ( @xmath40 ) scale as @xmath50 .",
    "equation ( 12 ) fails for @xmath10 @xmath48 @xmath21 where water is not appreciably sublimated .",
    "the average column density of oh absorbers , @xmath68 in the image of the host star , is given by the expression :",
    "@xmath69 if oh is optically thin in each portion of the stellar image and if for these exploratory models we ignore limb darkening ( see hubeny & heap 1996 ) , then the total absorption in a spectral line just depends upon @xmath68 and not the details on how the gas is spatially distributed .",
    "therefore , if the minimum column density for cometary detection is @xmath70 , then using equations ( 3 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , we require that : @xmath71 since @xmath40 varies as @xmath50 , we see from equation ( 14 ) that @xmath9 is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 depends upon the telescopes and instruments that are used . within the interstellar medium where the gas has a similar velocity dispersion to what we expect for the outflow from a comet , oh column densities of @xmath510@xmath19 @xmath54",
    "have been measured ( roueff 1996 ) .",
    "although the oh produced by comets is distributed over more energy levels than the oh within the interstellar medium ( see , for example , schleicher & ahearn 1988 ) , since the same number of photons are absorbed from the background source if the oh is optically thin , it may be possible with modern detectors and cross correlation techniques to detect total oh column densities in cometary outflows as low as 10@xmath19 @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath70 = 10@xmath19 @xmath54 , we find for environments similar to the solar system s that @xmath9 @xmath72 170 km@xmath73 ; analogs to comet hale - bopp with @xmath9 = 1500 km@xmath73 easily satisfy this criterion .",
    "moreover , from equation ( 14 ) , if @xmath74 = 10@xmath19 @xmath54 , then an analog to comet hale - bopp could be detected around a g - type star where the ultraviolet luminosity is as much as a factor of 9 larger than the sun s .      in our simple model ,",
    "a comet is only active if @xmath10 @xmath47 @xmath21 . from equation ( 10 )",
    ", we find that for the half of the orbit between @xmath60 = 0 and @xmath60 = @xmath75 , the maximum angle for cometary activity , @xmath76 , is : @xmath77    for simplicity , we assume that the comet s outflow is undetectable for @xmath10 @xmath47 @xmath78 where @xmath78 is defined as the region where the oh lines are optically thick . we introduce a minimum angle , @xmath79 , in a fashion similar to our definition of @xmath76 in equation ( 15 ) except that we substitute @xmath78 for @xmath21 .",
    "as described below , we are most interested in environments where the ultraviolet luminosity of the host star is much larger than the sun s .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath78 = 1 au since , as shown in figure 1 , this is the region where the oh column density exceeds 10@xmath53 @xmath54 and therefore the outflow from the comet becomes compact and opaque .",
    "with @xmath78 = 1 au , @xmath21 = 2 au and @xmath59 @xmath23 1 , we list in table 1 values of @xmath79 and @xmath76 for analogs to those solar system comets with @xmath9 @xmath48 50 km@xmath80 and @xmath58 @xmath47 2 au from ahearn et al .",

    "from the perspective of the host star , we imagine two strips of solid angle , one for the inbound and one for the outbound portions of the comet s orbit , through which the comet must pass . in each strip , an element of solid angle where the comet transits the host star is defined by the angular height , @xmath81 , multiplied by the angular width , @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the probability that we can witness transient absorption , @xmath83 , is given by the fraction of sky covered by the two strips , or , using equation ( 10 ) : @xmath84\\,+\\,{\\epsilon}[\\sin{\\theta}_{max}\\,-\\,\\sin{\\theta}_{min}])}{{\\pi}r_{p}(1\\,+\\,{\\epsilon})}\\ ] ] we list in table 1 values of @xmath83 for analogs to recently observed comets ; @xmath83 typically is near 0.1% .",

    "we now estimate the duration , @xmath85 , of each absorption event .",
    "we take for an  average \" cometary transit time that @xmath85 = @xmath86 .",

    "for these objects , then @xmath96 = 8 @xmath0 10@xmath97 s@xmath18 . in the solar system , the cumulative number of comets with area larger than @xmath9 varies approximately as @xmath98 , at least for objects with radii between 1 km and 10 km .",
    "( see meech , hainaut & marsden 2004 and convert from radius distribution to area distribution ) .",
    "therefore , scaling from @xmath9 = 50 km@xmath80 to @xmath9 = 1500 km@xmath80 , we expect that comets at least as large as hale - bopp have an arrival rate in the inner solar system of 7 @xmath0 10@xmath99 s@xmath18 .",
    "this estimate implies that a very large comet like hale - bopp should arrive every 50 years , a rate that is approximately consistent with the historic data .",
    "for example , sekanina ( 2002 ) has argued that comet 1882 r1 had a size similar to hale - bopp s . with @xmath96 = 7 @xmath0 10@xmath99 s@xmath18 , we find from equation ( 19 ) that @xmath94 = 3 @xmath0 10@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the probability of detecting an individual comet around an analog to the sun is very low .",
    "above , we have considered the possibility of detecting comets around stars similar to the sun . here , we consider extrapolating these models to models for the sun at earlier ages .",
    "there are two competing factors .",
    "first , the younger stars are more active and may emit as much as 50 times more ultraviolet light ( ayres 1997 , guinan , ribas & harper 2003 ) .",
    "however , the stellar ultraviolet luminosity and level of activity is variable , and some young stars have ultraviolet luminosities  only \" @xmath510 times the solar value .",
    "thus analogs to comet hale - bopp might be detectable .",
    "second , there are both theoretical and observational reasons for thinking that young solar - type stars might have vastly greater comet arrival rates than is currently witnessed in the solar system",
    ". models for the formation of the earth all invoke the build - up of smaller planetesimals . in this context , wetherill ( 1992 ) has computed that in young planetary systems where there is no analog to jupiter , the rate of cometary periastron passages less than 1 au could be 3 @xmath0 10@xmath100 greater than is currently seen in the solar system .",
    "also , models for the delivery of water to the earth describe how giant planets perturb the orbits of icy planetesimals into elliptical orbits which result in matter from the outer planetary system being injected to within 1 au of the host star ( morbidelli et al .",
    ". these planetesimals may be asteroids ( petit , morbidelli & chambers 2001 ) or comets . to estimate the magnitude of this effect , consider that the total mass of the earth s ocean is 1.4 @xmath0 10@xmath101 g. if this water was mainly delivered during the earth s first 50 myr , then the water accretion rate onto the earth was @xmath510@xmath102 g s@xmath18 .",
    "currently , the zodiacal light is explained by a dust infall rate of 3 @xmath0 10@xmath103 g s@xmath18 ( fixsen & dwek 2002 ) while the earth only accretes about 10@xmath104 g s@xmath18 of dust ( love & brownlee 1993 ) .",
    "( while dust in the ecliptic plane largely results from collisions between asteroids [ grogan , dermott & durda 2001 ] , when considering the entire sky , an appreciable fraction of the current zodiacal cloud results from the disintegration of comets [ hahn et al .",
    "2002 ] ) . during the era of ocean formation , if the efficiency of the accretion by the earth of dust with a comet - like origin was 3 @xmath0 10@xmath105 as suggested by the current environment , then the inner solar system may have experienced a total infall rate of water - rich planetesimals of @xmath510@xmath106 g s@xmath18 . therefore , it is possible that in the early solar system , the rate of arrival of icy objects within 1 au was @xmath53 @xmath0 10@xmath100 times larger than the current rate of the arrival of comets .",
    "this enhancement of the cometary arrival rate suggests that the probability of any single oh - sensitive observation detecting a large hale - bopp analog in such a young system approaches 1% .",
    "above , we have discussed models for the detectability of comets . here , we suggest possible targets for an observational program . although many observers avoid working in the near ultraviolet , israelian , garcia lopez & rebolo ( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have observed the oh bands near 3100  in solar - type stars to infer their oxygen abundances .",
    "it may be possible to extend such studies to search for comets .",
    "comets within 2 au of a solar - type star not only sublimate ice , but they also eject dust into their surroundings .",
    "this dust has a characteristic temperature @xmath48200 k which results in substantial emission at 25 @xmath3 m .",

    "2002 , zuckerman & song 2004 ) .",
    "however , the enormous increase in sensitivity provided by _ spitzer _ ( werner et al . 2004 ) has allowed the study of circumstellar grains around many more solar - type stars .",
    "specifically , recent _ spitzer _ observations of 15 myr old solar - type stars in the lower centaurus crux association show substantial 24 @xmath3 m excesses where the dust production rates may be 10@xmath103 greater than the dust production rate for the zodiacal light within the solar system ( chen et al .",
    "these same stars also display relatively low x - ray luminosities compared to other solar - type stars in the same association , and consequently , they may also have relatively low ultraviolet luminosities",
    ". therefore they may be suitable targets for comet - searching .",
    "some solar - type stars as old as 100 myr also show substantial 24 @xmath108 excesses ( gorlova et al .",
    "2004 ) .    unfortunately , the prospects for detecting transient oh absorption around warmer stars like @xmath6 pic ( @xmath61 = 8.5 l@xmath92 ; @xmath109 = 8200 k ; crifo et al .",
    "1997 ) are not very good .",
    "that is , @xmath6 pic emits enough photospheric light between 1600  and 1800  , where both oh and water have significant photodissociation cross sections , that the lifetimes of these molecules are relatively short .",
    "in particular , given the star s luminosity , we would expect that comets at 3 au around @xmath6 pic might resemble comets at 1 au around the sun .",
    "using archived hst data ( see roberge et al .",
    "2000 ) , scaling the observed ultraviolet flux upwards by ( 19.3 pc/3 au)@xmath73 , and using the compilation of the photodestruction cross sections by budzien et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we find that the lifetimes at 3 au around @xmath6 pic of oh and h@xmath2o are @xmath51600 s and @xmath5330 s , respectively . as a result , from equation ( 14 ) , only comets with areas greater than 3 @xmath0 10@xmath93 km@xmath73 would be large enough to produce an oh column density of 10@xmath19 @xmath54 . thus transient oh absorption spectrum is expected to be very weak unless the comet is vastly larger than hale - bopp .",
    "some gas - phase co is seen in the ultraviolet absorption - line spectrum of @xmath6 pic , but it does not change with time and it is probably not directly associated with infalling comets ( roberge et al .",
