    "electron and exciton dynamics between chromophores are ubiquitously found  from photosynthetic complexes in biological organisms@xcite to organic semiconductors for solar energy conversion.@xcite they are often modeled by quantum dynamics methods based on the quantum master equation,@xcite which requires so - called model hamiltonians in the diabatic representation as an input .",
    "the model hamiltonians are the reduced dimensional representation of the electronic degree of freedom in such systems , consisting of the energies of the diabatic states and the interaction strengths between these states .",
    "although accurate model hamiltonians are of essential importance in achieving predictive simulations of electron and exciton dynamics , there have been only a few studies to develop accurate electronic structure methods to compute them from first principles.@xcite    we have recently introduced the active space decomposition ( asd ) method to provide accurate model hamiltonians .",
    "the asd model takes advantage of molecular geometries to compress active - space wave functions of molecular dimers,@xcite in which wave functions are parameterized as@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 label monomers and @xmath4 and @xmath5 label monomer states .",
    "the monomer wave functions ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) are determined by diagonalizing the respective monomer active space hamiltonians ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) in an orthogonal active subspace ( hereafter referred to as an asd subspace ) .",

    "is exact when each @xmath4 and @xmath5 entirely span the corresponding monomer space , and converges rapidly with respect to the number of monomer states included in the summation.@xcite an extension to more than two active subspaces has also been reported by the authors.@xcite furthermore , the dimer basis states have well - defined charge , spin , and spin - projection quantum numbers on each monomer , allowing us to extract model hamiltonians for electron and exciton dynamics through diagonalization of diabatic subblocks of a dimer hamiltonian matrix.@xcite this methodology has been applied to singlet exciton fission dynamics in tetracene and pentacene crystals.@xcite the resulting model hamiltonians have been used to benchmark approximate methods in more recent studies.@xcite    however , our asd method was not applicable to covalently linked chromophores in previous works .",
    "this was mainly due to the difficulty in finding appropriate asd subspaces . in the original formulation of asd",
    ", one must define localized asd subspaces from localized hartree ",
    "fock orbitals.@xcite although well defined ( and even automated ) for molecular dimers and aggregates , this procedure gives rise to an ambiguity in the definition of the asd subspaces in covalently linked chromophores owing to orbital mixing .",
    "this problem has hampered applications of asd to these systems .    in this study",
    ", we remove this ambiguity in the subspace preparation by deriving and implementing orbital optimization algorithms for the asd model .",
    "the orbital optimization guarantees that ( when converged ) identical results are obtained regardless of the choice of initial active orbitals .",
    "as shown in the following , the orbital optimization procedure naturally leads to localized asd subspaces without deteriorating the diabatic structure of the dimer basis function in the original asd method .",
    "the preservation of locality of the asd subspaces during orbital optimization is analogous to the fact that , for a fixed number of renormalized states , _ ab initio _ density matrix renormalization group algorithms using localized orbitals provide the lowest energies .",
    "@xcite a quasi - second - order algorithm is employed,@xcite which is akin to conventional complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) and its occupation restricted variants ( rasscf).@xcite in the following our orbital - optimized models are referred to as asd - casscf and asd - rasscf depending on the underlying monomer active - space wave functions .",
    "in asd the energy of a dimer state is a function of molecular orbital ( mo ) coefficients ( @xmath9 ) , configuration interaction ( ci ) coefficients within each monomer ( @xmath10 with @xmath11 labeling slater determinants for @xmath12 , @xmath3 ) , and asd coefficients [ @xmath13 in eq .  ] , i.e. , @xmath14 we first form the monomer basis by solving configuration interaction within each asd subspace @xmath15 where @xmath16 and so on . using the monomer basis states ,",

    "this quasi - variational behavior is explained as follows .",
    "the total derivatives of the asd energy with respect to variations of mo coefficients are @xmath31 where respective normalization conditions are implicit .",
    "first , it follows from the asd procedure that the stationary condition with respect to @xmath13 , @xmath32 is automatically satisfied .",
    "second , the following equations are approximately satisfied , @xmath33 the residuals of these derivatives are related to the differences between the asd energies computed by lowest - energy monomer states and variationally optimal ones ( with the same number of states in the summation ) , which are expected to be much smaller than the energies themselves in the cases where asd is a good approximation . as a result ,",
    "one obtains that the total derivative [ eq .  ] is approximately zero , making the orbitals almost variationally optimal . in the cases where",
    "convergence is not achieved under this approximation , we fix @xmath34 and @xmath35 after several iterations ( but not @xmath13 ) ; when @xmath34 and @xmath35 are fixed , the last two terms in eq .   that introduce numerical noise become exactly zero because the derivatives of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are zero , and hence , the minimum in this constrained frame can be found by standard minimization algorithms using the partial derivative of energy with respect to orbital rotations [ i.e. , eq .  ] .",
    "after the convergence asd - ci is performed once again using the optimized orbitals .",
    "the solutions are obtained by iterating this procedure until consistency between orbitals and @xmath34 and @xmath35 is achieved .",

    ". note that density matrices have permutation symmetry ; for instance , @xmath49 the density matrix elements with all indices belonging to the same monomer are computed separately for computational efficiency as @xmath50 using rotated monomer states @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
