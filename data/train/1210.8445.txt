    "from the theoretical point of view , the analysis of baryon semileptonic decays , @xmath2 , is rather involved due to the participation of both vector and axial - vector currents . in the past , the understanding of the consequences of the weak hadronic currents relied on the cabibbo model @xcite , i.e. , on an exact flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "however , with the advent of high - statistics experiments @xcite , the departure from the limit of exact symmetry has now become more evident and one is prompted to compute the effects of su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the form factors .",
    "the leading vector form factors in baryon semileptonic decays are protected by the ademollo - gatto theorem @xcite against su(3 ) breaking corrections to lowest order in @xmath3 .",
    "for this reason , the theoretical framework to compute them is under reasonable control within the limits of experimental precision .",
    "however , in the case of the axial - vector form factors one faces larger theoretical uncertainties because of the appearance of first - order su(3 ) breaking effects .    although one can assert that in recent years lattice qcd calculations have demonstrated remarkable progress in computing hadron properties from first principles with high accuracy , analytical calculations of these properties are not possible because qcd is strongly coupled at low energies .",
    "thus , a number of different methods have been developed to understand the low - energy qcd hadron dynamics .",
    "in particular , su(3 ) breaking corrections to baryon semileptonic decay form factors have been analyzed within quark and soliton models @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite , the 1/@xmath0 expansion @xcite , ( heavy ) baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite , as well as within the combined framework of large-@xmath0 baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "large-@xmath0 qcd is the generalization of qcd from three colors @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "the baryon sector in the large-@xmath0 limit of qcd exhibits an exact su(@xmath6 ) contracted spin - flavor symmetry , where @xmath7 is the number of light quark flavors . in the large-@xmath0 limit ,",
    "decuplet and octet baryon states become degenerate , the difference @xmath8 between the su(3 ) invariant masses of the decuplet and octet baryons given by @xmath9 .",
    "the spin - flavor symmetry allows one to classify large-@xmath0 baryon states and matrix elements and to compute static properties of large-@xmath0 baryons in a systematic expansion in 1/@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this formalism has been applied to a variety of physical quantities , including the baryon axial vector current @xcite .",
    "another systematic and model - independent method is chiral perturbation theory which is based on the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xmath10 of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "it is the low - energy effective field theory of qcd , formulating the dynamics in terms of the pseudoscalar octet of goldstone bosons .",
    "physical observables can be expanded systematically , order by order , in powers of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the meson momentum , @xmath14 is the goldstone boson mass and @xmath15 is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of heavy particles such as the proton or the neutron , whose masses do not vanish in the chiral limit @xmath16 , can be performed within the framework of ( lorentz invariant ) baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite or heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use the latter approach which involves velocity - dependent baryon fields and where the expansion of the baryon chiral lagrangian in powers of @xmath17 and 1/@xmath18 ( where @xmath18 is the baryon mass ) is manifest .",
    "in particular , chiral logarithmic corrections due to meson loops were considered in refs .",
    "a crucial observation was that while these corrections are large when only octet baryon intermediate states are kept , the inclusion of decuplet baryon intermediate states yields sizable cancellations between one - loop corrections .",
    "this observation , as we will illustrate in the present work , can be rigorously explained in the context of the 1/@xmath0 expansion .    a very powerful method  the one we will use in the present work  is constituted by the combined use of the @xmath1 expansion and chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it describes the interactions between the spin-@xmath19 baryon octet and the spin-@xmath20 baryon decuplet with the pseudoscalar goldstone boson octet augmented by the @xmath21 .",
    "observables that have been calculated within this combined framework include baryon masses @xcite , baryon magnetic moments @xcite and the baryon axial vector current @xcite .",
    "when computing the renormalization of the baryon axial vector current at one - loop order , large-@xmath0 cancellations between various feynman diagrams occur , provided that both octet and decuplet intermediate states are considered . while the general structure of these cancellations was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the explicit evaluation of the corresponding operator expressions , which involve complicated structures of commutators and/or anticommutators of the su(6 ) spin - flavor operators , was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work we go beyond the analysis of ref .",

    "symmetry breaking is accounted for implicitly , since the loop integrals depend on the pion , kaon and @xmath23 masses . as an application of our formalism , given the precision of our analytic expressions , we are then able to perform various fits in order to determine the basic parameters of large-@xmath0 baryon chiral perturbation theory as well as to extract baryon axial vector couplings from baryon semileptonic decays and from the pion decays of decuplet baryons .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "first , we can make use of the @xmath1 power - counting scheme introduced in previous works @xcite , which states that , for baryons with spins of order one , @xmath102 this is equivalent to state that factors of @xmath103 are @xmath1 suppressed relative to factors of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we can safely implement this @xmath0 counting rule provided that we restrict ourselves to the lowest - lying baryon states , namely , those that constitute the @xmath106 dimensional representation of su(6 ) .",
    "second , we should also take into account that an odd or an even number of insertions of the baryon mass operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dakc ] ) yields structures with a rather different order in @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath0-dependence was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite throughout a detailed analysis .",
    "the basic idea is quite simple : one needs to count powers of @xmath107 because of the @xmath1 suppression the factor @xmath108 introduces .",
    "for instance , in @xmath37 and @xmath65 the spin operator @xmath107 appears a minimum of 0 and 2 times , respectively .",
    "let @xmath109 be the number of @xmath107 s from @xmath37 and @xmath65 beyond these minimum values in a given structure .",
    "thus , contributions with no mass insertion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dakc ] ) are order @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 . for one mass insertion , they are order @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath114 for @xmath113 . for two mass insertions , they are order @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "let us remark that this power counting already includes a @xmath1 suppression due to the overall factor @xmath116 which comes along with the loop integral .",
    "let us analyze the implications this power counting scheme has on the different summands in eq .",

    "[ fig : eins](a , b , c ) , provided that all baryon states in a complete multiplet of the large-@xmath0 su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry are included in the sum over intermediate states and that the axial coupling ratios predicted by this spin - flavor symmetry are used @xcite . by explicit computation",
