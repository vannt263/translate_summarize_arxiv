    "emulation of various effects from condensed - matter physics in atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , where such effects may be studied in a simpler and clearer form , has recently attracted much attention emulator .",
    "a well - known example is the implementation of spin - orbit ( so ) interactions , of both the dresselhaus @xcite and rashba rashba types , in a binary bec , realized experimentally @xcite , and elaborated in detail theoretically @xcite , as a mixture of two different atomic states , with a linear coupling between them induced by a specially designed laser field . in this case , the pseudo - spinor order parameter representing standard so effects is mapped into the two - component wave functions of the mixture ( a brief review of the topic was given in ref .",
    "a similar method is also used for the emulation of gauge fields , both abelian and non - abelian @xcite , in terms of the bec , which is a topic of a great current interest  too @xcite .",
    "the interplay of the so coupling , which is a linear feature of the binary superfluid , and the mean - field bec  nonlinearity gives rise to a number of remarkable effects , such as vortices @xcite , monopoles @xcite and skyrmions @xcite , multi - domain patterns wang , structures induced by nonlocal interactions  @xcite , tricritical points @xcite , solitons  @xcite , etc .",
    "in particular , recent work @xcite elaborates the description of two - dimensional ( 2d ) vortices in trapping potentials , based on the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) , similar to that developed in a more general 3d setting with a spatially modulated strength of the self - repulsive nonlinearity in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the use of optical lattices gives rise to additional possibilities in this context @xcite , including the creation of gap solitons @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fact that the system of gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) , derived for the so - coupled binary condensate in  ref .",
    "@xcite , is tantamount to the model of the co - propagation of orthogonal polarizations of light in twisted nonlinear optical fibers  @xcite , establishes a link between nonlinear optical media and the so effects in binary bec .",
    "another link to optics is provided by the fact that the effective pseudospin , which underlies the concept of the so coupling in bec , is also a central point in optical emulations of graphene @xcite .",
    "while , as mentioned above , diverse vortex patterns were found in so - coupled bec  with the repulsive nonlinearity , trapped in external potentials , the aim of the present work is to construct two - dimensional ( 2d ) vortex solitons created in such binary condensates by _ attractive _ nonlinear interactions .",
    "the consideration of this setting is suggested by the accessibility of attractive interactions , usually supported by the feshbach resonance @xcite , in many species of atomic bec , including @xmath2li @xcite , @xmath3rb @xcite , na @xcite , cs @xcite , cr @xcite , @xmath4k @xcite , @xmath5yb @xcite , and @xmath6er @xcite .",
    "the concept of vortex solitons supported by self - attractive nonlinearities is a well - known one since the pioneering work @xcite , but in free space they are usually subject to strong splitting instabilities , even if the form of the nonlinearity ( quadratic or saturable ) prevents the onset of collapse in such media @xcite .",
    "another peculiarity of the vortex solitons is that the simple tfa , which is efficient for handling vortices in the case of the self - repulsion , as mentioned above @xcite , does not apply to self - attraction .",
    "the stabilization of vortex solitons , against the collapse and splitting alike , is provided by trapping potentials , which may be spatially periodic ( lattice - shaped , see reviews @xcite ) , or harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) ones , as was studied in detail for the cubic @xcite and quadratic @xcite nonlinearities .",
    "modes with the hidden vorticity \" , i.e. , two - components states with vorticities @xmath7 and @xmath8 , can also be stabilized by the harmonic - oscillator potential @xcite .",
    "although periodic potentials make the settings anisotropic , destroying the conservation of the angular momentum , the vorticity of the corresponding localized modes can be defined in  the usual manner , as the phase circulation around the vortex pivot , divided by @xmath9 .",
    "the main result of the present work , reported below in section 2 , is that two different families of vortex solitons , namely _ semi - vortices _ ( svs , with topological charges @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the two components ) and _ mixed modes _ ( mms , which combine @xmath10 and @xmath1 in each component ) are _ stable _ in the 2d binary system with the rashba coupling in the _ free space _",
    ", without the support of any trapping potential . of course , in a real experiment , any matter - wave state is created in a trapping potential .",
    "we actually demonstrate that the semi - vortices and mixed modes readily self - trap under the protection of the usual isotropic ho trapping potential , and remain stable if the potential is gradually switched off . in this connection",
    ", it is worth to mention that the so coupling , induced by resonant laser beams @xcite , and the ho trap may be manipulated in a completely independent fashion .",
    "the sv and mm realize , severally , the system s ground state in the cases when the self - attraction is stronger or weaker than its cross - attraction counterpart [ in terms of optics @xcite , these are the self - phase - modulation ( spm )  and cross - phase - modulation ( xpm ) interactions , respectively ] . furthermore , although the galilean invariance of the system is broken by the so - coupling terms , stable moving modes of both sv and mm types exist too , up to a certain critical velocity , which is shown in section 3 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first example of any species of _ stable _ 2d solitons in a free - space system with the attractive local cubic nonlinearity ( 2d solitons can be readily stabilized by nonlocal self - attraction terms @xcite ) .",
