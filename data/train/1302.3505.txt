    "the notion of a ` bare ' particle loses its significance once it is strongly coupled to a medium .",
    "landau introduced the notion of a quasiparticle whose properties may be very different from those of a bare particle @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example is an electron moving in a crystal : the electron displaces the nearby ions and carries this distortion with it .",
    "the presence of the phonon cloud changes the mass and energy of the electron , that is dubbed as ` polaron ' @xcite .",
    "more generally , a polaron arises whenever a quantum impurity is strongly coupled to an environment .",
    "these quantum - mechanical quasiparticles play a key role in the low - energy behavior of a macroscopic quantum liquid .    in recent years",
    ", the field of ultracold atoms has provided an exciting framework for studying polaronic effects .",
    "a key idea is that models designed for describing the rich and non - trivial structure of the solid state , can be emulated in a clean and controllable manner with ultracold atoms .",
    "for example , so - called fermi polarons @xcite , spin - down impurities that are strongly coupled to a spin - up fermi sea , can be created in a degenerate two - component atomic fermi gas when going to the limit of strong spin - imbalance close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "the impurity is coherently dressed with particle - hole excitations of the fermi sea .",
    "the properties of the fermi polaron are important for the quantitative understanding of a strongly imbalanced fermi gas @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the ` attractive fermi polaron ' , with an attractive interaction between the impurity and the fermions of the bath .",
    "a recent experiment using an ultracold gas of @xmath1li atoms in three dimensions revealed the existence of fermi polarons through a narrow quasiparticle peak in the impurities radio - frequency ( rf ) spectrum @xcite . at a critical interaction strength ,",
    "the disappearance of this peak was interpreted as a transition from polaronic to molecular binding , when the impurity and an atom of the sea form a two - body bound state .",
    "such a transition had theoretically been predicted in three dimensions ( 3d ) by prokofev and svistunov @xcite . to determine the transition point",
    ", they developed a diagrammatic monte carlo technique ( diagmc ) capable of solving the fermi polaron model@xcite .",
    "calculations of the ground - state energy showed that for a sufficiently strong attraction between the impurity atom and the atoms of the spin - up fermi sea , a molecular state becomes energetically favorable .",
    "the crossing point was found at an interaction strength @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the fermi momentum of the spin - up sea and @xmath4 the @xmath5-wave scattering length . a variational treatment developed by chevy based on an expansion up to single particle - hole excitations on top of the unperturbed fermi sea turned out to be remarkably accurate @xcite .",
    "a combination of chevy s ansatz with a variational wave function in the molecular limit @xcite also revealed the polaron - to - molecule transition , very close to the diagmc result .    in the present work",
    ", we study the quasiparticle properties of the fermi polaron problem in 3d with the diagmc technique @xcite .",
    "this technique evaluates a series of feynman diagrams for the one - particle and two - particle proper self - energies .",
    "a full description of the diagmc algorithm was presented in ref .",
    "building on the work of ref .",
    "@xcite we have implemented the diagmc algorithm independently .",
    "we explore various diagmc schemes @xcite and series resummation methods to check the robustness of the results against the possible uncertainties of summing the series .",
    "first , we confirm the transition point .",
    "next , we calculate the quasiparticle residue which we compare to experimental data and variational results . the quasiparticle residue , or @xmath0-factor , gives the overlap of the non - interacting wave function and the fully interacting one , @xmath6 with @xmath7 the fully interacting ground state and @xmath8 a free spin - down atom carrying momentum @xmath9 in a non - interacting fermi sea @xmath10 of @xmath11 spin - up atoms .",
    "the spin - up atoms are non - interacting since @xmath12-wave scattering is negligible .",
    "the residue reflects the impurity s probability of free propagation .",

    "we introduce the model and the structure of the feynman diagrammatic expansion . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss the results of the numerical calculations .",

    "also the resummation of the diagrammatic series is discussed in depth .",
    "the results for the quasiparticle properties , like the residue , are the subject of section [ sec3 ] .",
    "we consider a dilute two - component gas of ultra - cold fermionic atoms interacting via the van der waals - potential .",

    "the spin-@xmath17 fermions have mass @xmath18 and dispersion @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the volume of the system . we take @xmath21 throughout the paper , and consider the mass - balanced case @xmath22 .",
    "all the theoretical considerations are for zero temperature ( or @xmath23 with @xmath24 the fermi temperature ) .",
    "the diluteness of the system ensures that the range @xmath25 of the potential is much smaller than the typical inter - particle distance @xmath26 , or @xmath27 , with @xmath3 the fermi momentum of the spin - up sea , and therefore the details of the interaction potential become irrelevant .",
    "accordingly , without loss of generality , one can model the short - ranged interaction as a contact interaction , @xmath28 , in combination with the standard ultra - violet divergence regularization procedure described below .",
