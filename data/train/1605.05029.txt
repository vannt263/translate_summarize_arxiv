    "in this paper we show , using an _ exactly solvable model _ , that a dilute suspension in electrolyte solution of non - insulating solid spheres with ideally polarized interfaces , across which no charge , electronic or ionic , is transferred between the solution and the solid , can give rise to huge dielectric constants ( @xmath17 or more ) at low frequencies ( khz , far below plasma frequencies ) .",
    "this is remarkable considering that the electrolyte static permittivity is only about 80 while particle permittivity ( due to core electrons and lattice ) is about 1 - 5 at such frequencies .",
    "the only similar prior result we are aware of is by wong @xcite , who used a fixed ( zero ) potential interface , which generally means an ideally _",

    "but more important , wong s analysis involved a medley of different kinds of ions , some with faradaic ( redox ) reactions at the interface and other without .",

    "here we strip down to essential physics and use an exactly solved model , derived from first principle , for _ ideally polarizable interface _ to show that dielectric enhancements are natural outcome in non - insulating particles in electrolyte solution , explicable without resorting to complex surface chemistry .",

    "the dielectric enhancements with _ insulating _ clay - like charged particles with finite @xmath1-potentials suspended in electrolytes are well known @xcite , and are due to the guoy - chapman layer of the counter ions .",
    "briefly , dry clay has a dielectric constant of about 5 and that of water is about 80 but the real part the dielectric in a clay - brine mixture can be as large as @xmath18 at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "standard maxwell - wagner / maxwell - garnett ( @xcite ) analysis for a two - phase material is unable to explain such enhancements , see the appendix i. hinch _ et .",

    "this clay - effect for insulating particles disappears when the @xmath1-potential is zero .",
    "here we show that even with zero @xmath1-potential , non - insulating materials are capable of showing an dielectric enhancement , due to an lectrically nduced ouble ayer ( eidl ) produced by the low - frequency charge build - up from the blocking boundaries .",
    "analysis of electro - capillarity , electrophoresis and electro viscous forces on ideally polarizable metal drops require computing the polarizability of metallic spheres as we do  see the book by levich @xcite and references therein , and more recent papers @xcite.the term eidl has been used by bazant and his co - workers @xcite in their study of electrokinetic effects .",

    "it may be possible to estimate the volume fraction as well as the size of the metallic nougats .",

    "dielectric enhancement from even a dilute suspension of non - insulating spheres boosts the minuscule phase shift of an electrolyte solution to an easily observable level .",

    "[ eq : bc_eff ]  [ * b * ] is more significant .",
    "the discontinuity between @xmath129 and @xmath25 comes from the dipole moment produced by a large , inhomogeneous charge build - up within the eidl .",
    "this dipole moment is out of phase ( purely imaginary ) from the driving field , because the driving field is proportional to the @xmath146 in the eidl ( eq .  [ eq : n_0 ] ) , whereas the charge dynamics is always within the eidl is _ always out of phase _ from @xmath137 ( _ ibid . _ ) , and the two currents are linked by the perfectly polarizable boundary condition @xmath147 . as we will see below , it is precisely this out of phase dynamics that generates the imaginary part of @xmath84 in eq .",
