    "remote sensing of carbon dioxide for atmospheric applications requires a detailed knowledge of the rotational - vibrational spectra of all its major isotopologues .",
    "it is commonly believed that such measurements should be supported by reference line intensities of 1@xmath8 accuracy or better @xcite .",
    "this is the main requirement for successful interpretation of data from the nasa orbiting carbon observatory 2 ( oco-2 ) space mission , which is designed to monitor the concentration of carbon dioxide in earth s atmosphere . as was shown in our previous papers considering the main @xmath4c@xmath1o@xmath2 isotopologue ( denoted here as 626 ) , a fully _ ab initio _",
    "dipole moment surface is capable of providing such a level of accuracy @xcite .",
    "the next step is to address other isotopologues , which are ubiquitous in natural samples and may interfere with spectral lines of the main isotopologue as well as other species @xcite .",
    "concentration measurements of trace compounds also require very accurate line positions , intensities and line profiles of several isotopologues at the same time .    experimental line - intensity measurements for isotopologues other than the main 626 one are much more challenging due to their low natural abundance , which ranges from 1% for @xmath0c@xmath1o@xmath2 ( 636 ) down to 10@xmath9 % for the unstable @xmath3c@xmath1o@xmath2 ( 646 ) .",
    "enriched samples feature the need for precise ( _ a priori _ ) knowledge of isotopologue concentration .",
    "therefore experimental accuracies of line intensities for less abundant isotopologues of carbon dioxide are in general lower than for the main isotopologue .",
    "a comprehensive source of spectroscopic data for carbon dioxide is the hitran database @xcite .",
    "the 2012 release of this database contains line lists for the @xmath0c@xmath1o@xmath2 ( 636 ) , @xmath4c@xmath5o@xmath2 ( 727 ) , @xmath4c@xmath6o@xmath2 ( 828 ) and @xmath0c@xmath6o@xmath2 ( 838 ) isotopologues , all featuring spectral gaps because of lack of experimental data .",
    "line intensities included in the database have uncertainties of 5 - 20% , thus well above current requirements .",
    "the database comprises both semi - empirical ( taken from the pre - release of the cdsd database @xcite ) and purely experimental entries .",
    "multiple data sources are reflected by discontinuities in intensity patterns of some bands @xcite .",
    "several measurements have been made since the last edition of the database , to pursue the elusive naturally abundant molecules , although these studies also have uncertainties well above the desired 1% threshold .",

    "@xcite address several bands of carbon dioxide isotopologues with unprecedented , though still unsatisfactory , intensity accuracies between 1% and 20% .    among the few theoretical attempts to model high - resolution infrared spectra of carbon dioxide , the study by huang _",
    "et al . _",
    "from the nasa ames research center proved to be very accurate @xcite . line lists from huang _",
    "_  provide both line positions and intensities covering the infrared and visible spectral region ( @xmath10 ) for room temperature ( 296  k ) and 1000  k. line positions , derived from a variational approach and based on semi - empirical potential energy surface ( pes ) , are accurate to 0.03  0.2 @xmath7 .",
    "although the ames-1 line lists @xcite show the best agreement with experiment among all variational calculations , semi - empirical approaches based on effective hamiltonians can provide line positions with an accuracy at least one order of magnitude better @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "effective hamiltonian models strongly depend on the quality of the input data , thus the accuracy and completeness of this technique are limited by experiment .",
    "a major advantage of the use of variational nuclear motion programs is that , within the limits of the born - oppenheimer approximation , line intensities can be computed with the same accuracy for all isotopolgues . in the present study the computation of line intensities was based on _ ab initio _  dipole moment surfaces ( dmss ) , and these were preliminarily tested by several authors @xcite . some minor inaccuracies and discontinuities",
    "were discovered ; however , comparisons showed overall good agreement with experiment .",

    "@xcite . in this",
    "study the authors indicate and support the need for a unified theoretical treatment of line positions and intensities ; whereas the former are largely covered by experiments facilitated by effective hamiltonian models @xcite , the latter still await high levels of accuracy , which we target in the present study .",
    "due to lack of experimental data , a line list for the radioactive isotopologue @xmath3c@xmath1o@xmath2 is not included in the hitran2012 and cdsd-296 databases .",
    "the ames-1 line list is presently a unique source of high accuracy spectra for this species .",
    "the unstable @xmath3c@xmath1o@xmath2 isotopologue is of particular importance because of its usage in dating of biosamples and , more recently , in monitoring emissions , migrations and sinks of fossil fuel combustion products @xcite as well as for the assessment of contamination from nuclear power plants @xcite .",
    "until recently , monitoring fossil fuel emission relied mostly on @xmath11-decay count measurements or mass spectrometry , both of which are high cost , invasive methods .    despite its low natural atmospheric abundance",
    ", radiocarbon dioxide has been probed via optical spectroscopy methods @xcite .",
    "recent advances in absorption laser spectroscopy provided an unprecedented tool for detection of species containing radiocarbon of ratios @xmath3c/@xmath4c down to parts per quadrillion .",
    "these measurements exploit saturated - absorption cavity ring down ( scar ) spectroscopy technique @xcite for the strongest fundamentals of @xmath3co@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of accurate line intensities for several isotopologues at the same time is therefore a necessity for eliminating the unwanted noise sourced in traces of different isotopic carbon dioxide representatives .",
    "for instance the @xmath12 line of the 00011  00001 band in 646 , which is dedicated for radiocarbon measurements , above certain temperatures , heavily interferes with the lorentzian tail of the @xmath13 line in the 05511  05501 band of the 636 isotopologue @xcite .",
    "this raises difficulties in retrieving unbiased concentrations of the radioactive isotopologue .",
    "similar problems occurred in measurements based on the @xmath14 line of the @xmath15 band of @xmath3co@xmath2 @xcite . in both cases",
    "accurate values of line intensities are required .",
    "otherwise , as shown in @xcite , calculation of the fraction of @xmath3c in measured samples that employed a line strength taken from a theoretical approach , led to over 35 % error in retrieved concentrations ( as later confirmed by alternative experiments ( ams ) ) .",
    "these observations were explained in terms of both inaccuracies of the line intensity and drawbacks of the spectroscopic fit model used , which fuels the need for reliable line intensity sources .",
    "another successful technique further supporting this need was recently introduced by genoud _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , cavity ring - down spectroscopy with quantum cascade laser for monitoring of emissions from nuclear power plants .",
    "high quality line intensities for @xmath4c@xmath1o@xmath2 , @xmath0c@xmath1o@xmath2 and @xmath1o@xmath4c@xmath6o are also required for real - time detection methods based on quantum cascade lasers to monitor @xmath0c/@xmath4c isotope ratios in identification of bio - geo - chemical origins of carbon dioxide emissions from the soil - air interface @xcite .",
    "spectra of isotopologues can be used for a variety of different tasks such as the recent suggestion that observations of absorptions by @xmath0c@xmath1o@xmath2 in breath analysis provides a non - invasive means of diagnosing gastrointestinal cancers @xcite .    in this work",
    "we aim to provide highly accurate line intensities in the 0  8000 @xmath7  spectral region together with reliable semi - empirical line positions for six symmetric isotopologues of carbon dioxide ; five naturally abundant : 636 , 727 , 737 , 828 , 838 and one radioactive ( 646 ) . an important advantage of a first principles theoretical approach is wide spectral coverage , in contrast to limited laser tuning capability of some measurements . for this reason databases like hitran , containing ro - vibrational spectra of small molecules , often utilize various experimental data sources , thereby giving up consistency of entries .",
    "this is not the case for the _ ab initio",
    "_  approaches , which are believed to provide consistent accuracy of line intensities within a vibrational band @xcite .",
    "another issue related to post - processing of experimental data is the functional form of the herman - wallis factors .",
    "these , as arbitrarily chosen and empirically fitted , can become a source of unnatural biases for high @xmath16 transitions @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model implemented here should be inherently free from this problem , as the rotational contribution to line intensities is computed directly .",
    "the only underlying source of errors within the born - oppenheimer approximation is potential energy surface ( pes ) and dipole moment surface ( dms ) .",
    "the quality of both surfaces is assessed here by employing the line sensitivity analysis procedure introduced by lodi and tennyson @xcite , which requires computation of at least four line lists for each isotopologue .",
    "this allows us to detect resonances @xcite , that affect line intensities and significantly diminish the reliability of data provided .",
    "the final results are given in the form of line lists with associated uncertainties , which are available in the supplementary materials .",
    "uniformity of errors ( except for the regions affected by resonance interactions ) accompanied by the precise reproduction of observed line intensities at the sub - percent level for the majority of strong bands @xcite suggests our results provide a viable update to the current , 2012 version of the hitran database .",
    "the lodi - tennyson methodology presented in detail elsewhere @xcite is used to validate line lists on a purely theoretical basis . for each isotopologue four line lists",
    "were computed , based on set of two pess and two dmss .",
    "these surfaces come from two sources : the semi - empirical ames-1 pes and dms from huang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , an _ ab initio _  pes and dms ( ucl dms ) computed by us , where the former one was subsequently fitted to observed @xmath17 levels ( called below : fitted pes ) .",
    "details of all surfaces were presented before @xcite .",
    "these four high - quality surfaces are used in nuclear motion calculations to obtain rotational - vibrational energy levels , wavefunctions and line intensities .      the strategy for solving",
    "the nuclear - motion problem employed here is analogous to the one presented in @xcite . in the born - oppenheimer approximation",
    "the pes and dms are isotopologue independent",
    ". therefore the only parameters that distinguish between different isotopologues are the nuclear masses entering the expression for the kinetic energy operator ( keo ) of the nuclei .",
    "our approach is based on an exact , within the born - oppenheimer approximation , keo which is used in a two step procedure @xcite of solving the nuclear schrdinger equation .",
    "the first step involves solving the coriolis - decoupled ro - vibrational motion problem for every @xmath18 quantum number combination separately to supply a basis for the second step , where the full ro - vibrational hamiltonian is considered . the dvr technique implemented in the dvr3d suite @xcite",
    "is used to represent the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "diagonalisation of this matrix provides rotational - vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions . in the present study we used",
    "symmetrized radau coordinates and a bisector embedding to define nuclear degrees of freedom in the body - fixed coordinate system .",
    "nuclear masses for isotopes of carbon and oxygen were used : 11.996709 da ( @xmath4c ) , 13.000439 da ( @xmath0c ) , 14.000327 da ( @xmath3c ) , 15.990525 da ( @xmath1o ) , 16.995245 da ( @xmath5o ) and 17.995275 da ( @xmath6o ) @xcite . in the first step of the computation ( program dvr3djz ) the born - oppenheimer ro - vibrational wavefunctions were expanded in morse - like oscillator basis functions for stretching coordinates and legendre polynomials for the bending one ; symmetrised raudau internal coordinates were used . the converged dvr basis set associated with gauss - legendre quadrature points contained 30 radial and 120 angular functions , respectively . in the second step ( program rotlev3b ) we employed a @xmath19dependent basis set of symmetry - adapted symmetric - top rotational functions .",
    "the @xmath16 ranges considered were chosen to match those present in the hitran2012 database ( see table [ table : info ] ) .",
    "the same set of parameters was used to evaluate ro - vibrational energies computed from ames-1 and fitted pess .",
    "calculation of line strengths used the dipole program and require both dms and ro - vibrational wavefunctions as input functions .",
    "transformation from line strengths to transition intensities included scaling by natural isotopic abundance and multiplication by the appropriate spin statistical weights .",
    "partition functions at 296  k were taken from huang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and they agree to better than 0.1% with partition functions from the present computation based on ames-1 pes ( see table [ table : info ] ) . a natural - abundance weighted intensity cut - off was then set to @xmath20 cm / molecule . in the case of the radioactive isotopologue ( 646 )",
    "we assumed unit abundance and increased the cut - off value to @xmath21 cm / molecule .",
    "the _ ab initio _ dms is a primary source of inaccuracies in line intensities .",
    "the accuracy of the ucl dms has been proven to be at sub - percent level for several strong bands ( stronger than @xmath22 cm / molecule ) below 8000 @xmath7@xcite .",
    "a key feature of using an _ ab initio _ dms with a variational nuclear motion calculation is that entire vibrational bands are reproduced with similar accuracy .",
    "the reliability of line intensities obtained theoretically is correlated with the quality of @xmath16-dependent ro - vibrational wavefunctions , hence with an underlying pes .",
    "wavefunctions play an important role in capturing the interaction between different vibrational states .",
    "such resonance interactions can lead to intensity stealing and , particularly for so - called dark states , huge changes in transition intensities .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity analysis performed for 626 @xcite indicated that certain ro - vibrational energy levels of co@xmath2 are vulnerable to interactions induced by coriolis - type terms in the hamiltonian . these resonances may change intensities of lines , particularly for weak transitions , by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this effect manifests itself especially when the perturbing band is strong . for this reason",
    "even minor inaccuracies in the pes in regions where such interactions occur can significantly change the intensity of lines , hence not reflecting the accuracy of the dms .",
    "thus , it is important to filter out bands or specific transitions with perturbed intensities which should not be trusted .",
    "a few such bands have been reported for the main isotopologue of co@xmath2 ( 626 ) @xcite and other isotopologues @xcite .    here",
    "we adopt a scheme from our previous works @xcite , where a method of locating resonances was developed and tested on h@xmath2o and @xmath4c@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "cross - comparison of four line lists yielded an intensity scatter factor @xmath23 assigned to every line , which is defined as the ratio of the strongest to the weakest transition in a set of four intensities matching the same transition line .",
    "the four line lists read : ames-1 pes and ames dms ( named aa ) , ames-1 pes and ucl dms ( named au ) , fitted pes and ames dms ( named fa ) , fitted pes and ucl dms ( named fu ) .",
    "our base model , which should on theoretical grounds be the most accurate , is au ; it is from this model that our underlying uncertainties are drawn . for transitions involved in resonance interactions , calculations with different procedures should give markedly different results .",
    "the trustworthy line intensities should be stable under minor pes / dms modifications , hence should feature a small scatter factor .",
    "based on the statistics of the scatter factor we established arbitrary limits on @xmath23 for a line to be considered stable ( @xmath24 ) , intermediate ( @xmath25 ) and unstable ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "these values are the same for all isotopologues .",
    "we believe that this descriptor gives a robust measure of sensitivity of line intensities to small pes changes , and hence reflects the reliability of a theoretically evaluated line intensity .      as discussed above line positions for",
    "the `` recommended ucl - iao line list '' are taken from the cdsd-296 database @xcite .",
    "these line positions were calculated within the framework of the effective hamiltonian approach for which the partly - reduced polyad model was used @xcite .",
    "this model takes into account the resonance anharmonic , anharmonic+__l__-type and coriolis interactions .",
    "the global weighted fits of the effective hamiltonian parameters to the observed line positions collected from the literature were performed .",
    "the observations cover the 0.7 - 13  633 @xmath7  range , but for the rare isotopologues the ranges of the observations are considerably smaller .",
    "a review of the observed line positions used is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "each isotopologue was considered separately . in the case of isotopologues",
    "for which the observed line positions are scarce the effective hamiltonian parameters obtained from the multi - isotopologue fitting @xcite were used as an initial guess for further refinement of some of the parameters by separate fitting .",
    "the fitted sets of the effective hamiltonian parameters reproduce the observed line positions practically within their experimental uncertainties , from 10@xmath27 @xmath7  to 0.01 @xmath7 .",
    "the good predictive ability of the resulting effective hamiltonian parameters has been demonstrated many times @xcite .",
    "the exceptions are several bands of the asymmetric isotopologues which are perturbed by the interpolyad resonance anharmonic interactions .",
    "some of the examples are given in refs.@xcite .",
    "usually these perturbed bands are very weak .",
    "energy levels taken from the effective hamiltonian ( eh ) are generally considered to be accurate to 0.002 @xmath7  or better , which is usually more accurate than those given by pes based studies @xcite .",
    "multi - isotopologue fits allowed for completeness of eh line lists even for less abundant isotopologues @xcite . from this reason our recommended line lists include line positions from the effective hamiltonian calculations provided by the cdsd-296 database @xcite . however , the very limited experimental data for @xmath3c@xmath1o@xmath2 did not allow us to extract eh parameters for this isotopologue .",
    "therefore an alternative source of line positions is needed here .",
    "comparison of dvr3d ( ames-1 pes ) line positions with eh values for the @xmath0c@xmath1o@xmath2 isotopologue shows that on average agreement between the two is at the 0.02 @xmath7  level .",
    "within one vibrational band the residuals between eh and dvr entries remain almost constant .",
    "this observation suggests the viability of correcting the dvr3d line positions with respective differences for the main isotopologue .",
    "such an approach has recently been shown to give excellent results for h@xmath2@xmath6o and h@xmath2@xmath5o @xcite .",
    "thus , an attempt to correct dvr3d line positions with the effective hamiltonian values was made .",
    "first , energy differences between corresponding eh and dvr energy levels for the main isotopologue were taken : @xmath28 .",
    "next , each energy level of a given less abundant isotopologue was refined by adding respective difference to the dvr - computed value : @xmath29 .",
    "these refined energy levels were then compared to eh values .",
    "application of the above procedure to symmetric isotopologues of co@xmath2 resulted however in increased deviations between dvr and eh energy levels , hence should be considered here as unsuccessful .",
    "the reason for this is not entirely clear but the cited study for water @xcite took considerable care over the corrections to the born - oppenheimer approximation while the results here were based on a pes simultaneously fitted to data from several isotopologues with no allowance for the beyond born - oppenheimer effects .",
    "for this reason pure dvr3d line positions were used in the recommended line list for @xmath3c@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "below we present an overview of our line lists .",
    "the next subsection contains statistical analysis of the scatter factor for each isotopologue , which will be further used in detecting resonances in the following subsection .",
    "after that , we compare our present results to recent highly accurate measurements , which were not included in the latest release of the hitran database .",
    "next , a detailed comparison with the hitran2012 and cdsd-296 databases is performed .",
    "finally we discuss the radioactive 646 isotopologue in the environmental context , as one of possible applications of present results .",
