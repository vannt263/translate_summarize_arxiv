    "we deal in this paper with the linear boltzmann equation for _ dissipative interactions _ modeling the evolution of a granular gas , undergoing _ inelastic collisions _ with its underlying medium .",
    "actually , we shall see in the sequel that there is no contrast between the scattering theory of granular gases and that of classical _ ( elastic ) _ gases .",
    "this may seem quite surprising if one has in mind the fundamental differences that may be emphasized between the _ nonlinear kinetic theory _ of granular gases and that of classical gases , as briefly recalled in the next lines .",
    "let us begin by recalling the general features of the kinetic description of granular gas dynamics that can be recovered from the monograph @xcite or the more mathematically oriented survey @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 denotes the distribution function of granular particles with position @xmath5 and velocity @xmath6 at time @xmath7 then the evolution of @xmath4 is governed by the following generalization of boltzmann equation @xmath8 with initial condition @xmath9 , where the right  hand side @xmath10 models the collision phenomena and depends on the phenomenon we describe .    in the * nonlinear description * ,",
    "the collision operator @xmath11 $ ] is a quadratic operator modeling the binary collision phenomena between self - interacting particles . for _ hard  spheres _ interactions",
    ", it reads @xmath12(\\v)= \\it \\qn \\left[\\dfrac{1}{\\epsilon^2}f(\\x,\\vb , t)f(\\x,\\wb , t)-f(\\x,\\v , t)f(\\x,\\w , t)\\right]\\d\\w \\d\\n,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the relative velocity , @xmath14 the microscopic velocities @xmath15 are the pre  collisional velocities of the so  called inverse collision , which results in @xmath16 as post - collisional velocities",
    ". the main peculiarity of the kinetic description of granular gas is the inelastic character of the microscopic collision mechanism which induces that _ part of the total kinetic energy is dissipated_. this energy dissipation might be due to the roughness of the surface or just to a non - perfect restitution and is measured through a restitution coefficient @xmath17 ( which we assume here to be constant for simplicity , see remark [ referee3 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the collision phenomenon is a _",
    "non microreversible process_. generally , we assume that the energy dissipation does not affect the conservation of momentum .",
    "therefore , in the homogeneous setting , i.e. when @xmath18 is independent of the position , the number density of the gas is constant while the bulk velocity is conserved .",
    "however , the temperature of the gas @xmath19 continuously decreases _ ( cooling of granular gas)_. as a consequence , the stationary state of the inelastic collision operator @xmath20 is a given dirac mass .",
    "however , the homogeneous boltzmann equation for granular gases exhibits self  similar solution ( _ homogeneous cooling state _ ) @xcite .",
    "note the important contrast with the classical kinetic theory , i.e. when @xmath21 , for which it is well  known that the steady state of the collision operator is a maxwellian distribution .",
    "the * linear boltzmann equation for dissipative interactions * concerns dilute particles ( test particles with negligible mutual interactions ) immersed in a fluid at thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the total kinetic energy is dissipated when the dilute particles collide with particles of the host fluid .",
    "such physical models are well - suited to the study of the dynamics of a mixture of impurities in a gas @xcite for which the background is in thermodynamic equilibrium and that the polluting particles are sufficiently few .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the survey @xcite for more details on the theory of granular gaseous mixtures . assuming the fluid at thermal equilibrium and neglecting the mutual interactions of both the test and dilute particles , the collision operator @xmath22 is a _ linear scattering operator _ given by @xmath23=\\it \\qn \\left[\\dfrac{1}{\\epsilon^2}f(\\x,\\vb , t)\\mathcal{m}_1(\\wb)-f(\\x,\\v , t)\\mathcal{m}_1(\\w)\\right]\\d\\w \\d\\n\\ ] ] where @xmath24 stands for the distribution function of the host fluid .",
    "note that in such a scattering model , the microscopic masses of the dilute particles @xmath25 and that of the host particles @xmath26 can be different .",
    "we will assume throughout this paper that the distribution function of the host fluid is a given normalized maxwellian function : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the given bulk velocity and @xmath29 is the given effective temperature of the host fluid .",
    "it can be shown in this case that the number density of the dilute gas is the unique conserved macroscopic quantity ( as in the elastic case ) .",
    "the temperature is still not conserved but it remains bounded away from zero , which prevents the solution to the linear boltzmann equation to converge towards a dirac mass .",
    "this strongly contrasts to the nonlinear description and suggests that the linear scattering model associated with granular gases does not contrast too much with the one associated with classical gases .",
    "the first mathematical result in this direction is the following one according to which , as in the classical case , the unique steady state of @xmath0 remains gaussian .",
    "the fact that the linear boltzmann equation still possesses a stationary maxwellian velocity distribution was first obtained in @xcite and we refer to @xcite for a complete proof ( existence and uniqueness ) for hard - spheres model ( see also @xcite for a version of this result for maxwell molecules ) :    [ existence ] the maxwellian velocity distribution : @xmath30 with @xmath31 is the unique equilibrium state of @xmath0 with unit mass .",
    "[ referee3 ] note that , if one does not assume the restitution coefficient @xmath32 to be constant ( see @xcite for the general expression of non - constant restitution coefficient @xmath33 in the case , e.g. , of visco - elastic spheres ) then the nature of the equilibrium state of @xmath0 is still an open question : it is not known whether such a steady state is a maxwellian or not .",
    "consequently , it is still not clear that linear inelastic scattering models behave like elastic ones . for this reason",
    ", we shall restrict here our study of the linear boltzmann equation to a * _ constant _ * restitution coefficient .",
    "we also point out that , if the distribution function of the host fluid @xmath24 is not of gaussian type , the explicit expression of the equilibrium state of @xmath0 is an open question to our knowledge .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of such an equilibrium state allows to establish a linear version of the famous @xmath34theorem .",
    "precisely , for any _ convex _",
    "@xmath35function @xmath36 , one can define the associated entropy functional as @xmath37    [ theoh ] let @xmath38 be a space homogeneous distribution function with unit mass and finite entropy , i.e. @xmath39 then , @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for the ( unique ) solution to in @xmath42 .",
    "note that such a result is valid for any scattering operator with positive kernel and positive equilibrium @xcite . as an important consequence",
    ", it can be shown by suitable compactness arguments that any solution to the boltzmann equation ( with unit mass ) converges towards the maxwellian equilibrium @xmath43 .",
    "note also that , for the nonlinear boltzmann equation for dissipative interactions , the temperature is a trivial lyapunov functional leading to the convergence of any solution towards a delta mass .",
    "however , the construction of a lyapunov functional in the self - similar variables allowing relaxation towards the homogeneous cooling state is still an open question ( see , e.g. @xcite for related problems ) .    to summarize , the steady state of the linear collision operator for dissipative interactions has the same nature ( a maxwellian distribution ) as the one corresponding to non  dissipative interactions",
    "moreover , as in the classical case , by virtue of the @xmath34theorem , such a steady state attracts any solution to the space homogeneous boltzmann equation .",
    "this seems to indicate that _ most of the properties of the linear boltzmann equation for elastic interactions remain valid for inelastic scattering models .",
    "_ it is the main subject of this paper to make precise and confirm such an indication and the key ingredient will be the derivation of an integral representation of the gain part of the collision operator .",
    "the main concern of our paper is the derivation of a suitable representation of the gain part of the collision operator @xmath0 as an integral operator with _",
    "explicit kernel_. precisely , the linear collision operator @xmath0 can be split into @xmath44 where the gain part is @xmath45 while @xmath46 where the collision frequency @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 it is well - known that , for non  dissipative interactions , i.e. when @xmath21 , the gain part @xmath1 can be written as an integral operator with explicit kernel @xcite ( see also @xcite for similar results for the _ linearized _ boltzmann equation ) .",
    "we prove that such a representation is still valid in the dissipative case :    [ first ] if @xmath49 is such that @xmath50 , then @xmath51 where the integral kernel @xmath52 can be made explicit ( see ) .",
    "actually , most important is the fact that the integral kernel @xmath52 turns out to be very similar to that obtained in the classical case ( see for instance @xcite ) , the only changes standing in some explicit numerical constants .",
    "moreover , as we shall see , the kernel @xmath52 and the maxwellian distribution @xmath43 satisfy the following * detailed balance law * : @xmath53 that allows us to recover theorem [ existence ] in a direct way .",
    "recall that , in @xcite , the gaussian nature of the steady state of @xmath0 was obtained by replacing @xmath0 by its grazing collision limit .",
    "we derive from these two results some important consequences on the linear boltzmann equation with @xmath54 .",
    "the applications are dealing with the space dependent version of as well as with the space homogeneous version of it .",
    "the first one concerns the spectral properties of the boltzmann collision operator in its natural hilbert space setting .      applying the above @xmath34theo- + rem [ theoh ] with the quadratic convex function @xmath56",
    ", one sees that a natural function space for the study of the _ homogeneous linear boltzmann equation _ is the weighted space @xmath55 .",
    "now , from theorem [ first ] , it is possible to prove that the gain collision operator @xmath57 is _ compact _ in @xmath55 .",
    "this compactness result has important consequences on the structure of the spectrum of @xmath0 as an operator in @xmath55 .",
    "precisely , from weyl s theorem , the spectrum of @xmath0 in this space is given by the ( essential ) range of the collision frequency @xmath58 and of isolated eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities . since @xmath59 is a simple eigenvalue of @xmath0 ( its associated null space is spanned by @xmath43 ) , this leads to the existence of a positive spectral gap . in turns ,",
    "one proves that any solution to the space - homogoneous linear boltzmann equation converges at an exponential rate towards the equilibrium .",
    "_ these spectral results are technical generalizations of some of the fundamental results of t. carleman @xcite , but are new in the context of granular gas dynamics_.      it is easily seen that , for any nonnegative @xmath60 , @xmath61 i.e. the collision operator @xmath0 is _ conservative . _ then , formally , any nonnegative solution @xmath4 to ( with @xmath54 ) should satisfy the following _ mass conservation equation _",
    ": @xmath62 it is the main concern of section [ sec : honest ] to prove that such a formal mass conservation property holds true for any nonnegative initial datum @xmath63 as well documented in the monograph @xcite , this is strongly related to the honesty of the @xmath3-semigroup governing eq . .",
    "more precisely , if we denote by @xmath64 the streaming operator : @xmath65 it is not difficult to see that there exists some extension @xmath66 of @xmath67 that generates a @xmath3-semigroup of contractions @xmath68 in @xmath69 according to the so  called `` sub - stochastic perturbation '' theory , developed in @xcite , it can be proved that @xmath70 if and only if @xmath66 is the closure of the full transport operator : @xmath71 we show in section 4 that the latter holds .",
    "to do so , we shall use the integral representation ( theorem [ first ] ) in order to apply some of the results of @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ? * chapter 10 ) ) dealing with the classical linear boltzmann equation .",
    "we derive in section 2 the integral representation of @xmath1 ( theorem [ integrahs ] ) as well as some of its immediate consequences concerning the explicit expression of the collision frequency .",
    "we also recover theorem [ existence ] through a detailed balance law .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the collision operator @xmath0 in the narrow space @xmath72 and its spectral consequences . in section 4",
    "we apply the results of section 2 as well as some known facts about the classical linear boltzmann equation @xcite to the honesty of the solutions to the boltzmann equation for dissipative hard - spheres .",
    "let us consider the gain operator for dissipative hard  spheres : @xmath45 and let @xmath47 be the corresponding collision frequency : @xmath73 recall that @xmath24 is a maxwellian distribution function with bulk velocity @xmath74 and effective temperature @xmath75 .",

    "we are interested in this section in applying the result of the previous section to prove the existence of honest solutions to the linear boltzmann equation for dissipative hard ",
    "spheres @xmath298 with initial condition @xmath299 where the collision operator @xmath0 is given by eq . .",
    "recall that the streaming operator @xmath64 is defined by @xmath300 where @xmath301 .",
    "one can define then the multiplication operator @xmath302 by @xmath303 where , as in the previous section , @xmath47 is the collision frequency corresponding to _ dissipative hard spheres _ interactions and given by eq . .",
    "the following generation result is well - known @xcite    the operator @xmath64 generates a @xmath3-semigroup of isometries @xmath304 of @xmath305 given by : @xmath306 the operator @xmath307 with domain @xmath308 is the generator of a contractions @xmath3-semigroup @xmath309 given by @xmath310    let us define now @xmath311 as the gain operator @xmath1 endowed with the domain of @xmath312 : @xmath313 it is clear from that , for any @xmath314 , @xmath315 while @xmath316 for any @xmath314 , @xmath317 then , the following generation result is a direct consequence of @xcite :    there exists a positive contractions semigroup @xmath68 in @xmath305 whose generator @xmath66 is an extension of @xmath318 .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 is minimal , i.e. if @xmath319 is a positive @xmath3-semigroup generated by an extension of @xmath318 , then @xmath320 for any @xmath321    the natural question is now to determine whether the `` formal '' mass conservation identity can be made rigorous .",
    "namely , one aims to prove that , for any nonnegative @xmath322 , the following holds : @xmath323 the important point to be noticed is the following .",
    "if @xmath324 , then any function @xmath325 can be approximated by a sequence @xmath326 such that @xmath327 and @xmath328 as @xmath329 in particular , implies that @xmath330 now , for any given initial datum @xmath331 , @xmath172 , the solution @xmath332 of is such that @xmath333 i.e. @xmath334 this means that , if @xmath324 , then the solutions to the linear boltzmann equation are conservative . on the other hand , if @xmath66 is a larger extension of @xmath318 than @xmath335 , then there may be a loss of particles in the evolution ( see @xcite for the matter as well as @xcite for examples of transport equation for which such a loss of particles occurs because of boundary conditions ) .",
    "precisely , if @xmath336 then there exists @xmath337 , @xmath172 such that @xmath338    this shows that the determination of the domain @xmath339 of @xmath66 is of primary importance in the study of the boltzmann equation .",
    "this is the main concern of the so  called _ substochastic perturbation theory of @xmath3-semigroups _ @xcite .",
    "we point out that the question of the honesty of the semigroup governing the boltzmann equation also arises in the study of the _ space - homogeneous _ version of the latter equation .",
    "indeed , it is the unboundedness of the collision frequency ( and consequently that of whole collision operator @xmath0 ) that may give rise to _ dishonest solutions _ to the boltzmann equation .",
    "actually , to prove the honesty of the @xmath3-semigroup @xmath68 , we will adopt the strategy developed first in @xcite and systematized in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we will show that the gain operator @xmath311 fullfils the assumption of @xcite :      since the kernel @xmath52 differs from the corresponding one for classical gas , except from numerical constants , one can apply _ mutatis mutandis _ the technical calculations of ( * ? ? ?",

    ", we give a direct rigorous proof of the linear @xmath34theorem of @xcite . in order to stay in the formalism of @xcite",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the space - homogenous case .",
    "precisely , let @xmath345 denote the set of functions depending only on the velocity and integrable with respect to velocities : @xmath346 equipped with its natural norm @xmath347 for any nonnegative @xmath60 and @xmath348 in @xmath345 , we define the _ information _ of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath348 by @xmath349 with the conventions @xmath350 and @xmath351 for any @xmath352 .",
    "this means that the information is nothing but the entropy functional @xmath353 for the particular choice of @xmath354 one recalls the main result of @xcite :    [ voigt ] let @xmath355 be a stochastic operator of @xmath356 , i.e. @xmath355 is a positive operator such that @xmath357 for any @xmath358 @xmath359 .",
    "then , @xmath360 for any nonnegative @xmath60 , @xmath348 in @xmath345 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath361 is a nonnegative fixed point of @xmath355 then , @xmath362    according to the results of the previous section , it is not difficult to see that the restriction of @xmath68 to @xmath345 is a @xmath3-semigroup of stochastic operators of @xmath345 . since the unique equilibrium state @xmath363 is space",
    "independent , one sees that @xmath364 and , in particular , @xmath365 combining this with theorem [ voigt ] , one obtains a rigorous and direct proof of the @xmath34theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) :    let @xmath366 be a given nonnegative ( space homogeneous ) distribution function with unit mass , i.e. @xmath367 . assume that @xmath368 then @xmath369 where @xmath370 is the unique solution to with @xmath371 .",
    "note that , once the conservativity of the solution to the boltzmann equation asserted by theorem [ main ] , the above @xmath34-theorem can be proved by usual standard method of kinetic theory .",
    "however , we insist on the fact that such standard proofs require the solution @xmath174 to be conservative and , in some sense , the use of the substochastic semigroup theory .",
