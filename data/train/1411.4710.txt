    "the coupling between light and mechanical vibrations in optical microcavities usually occurs through a dispersive coupling between the optical resonant frequency and the mechanical vibration .",
    "such dispersive scheme , where the cavity frequency shifts due to the mechanical motion , has been used to demonstrate amplification , cooling and interference of mechanical modes @xcite .",
    "more recently several theoretical studies have explored optomechanical interaction within an optically active medium , which may relax the so - called resolved side - band regime , necessary to achieve ground state cooling  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with passive optomechanical cavities , active optomechanical cavities exhibiting purely dispersive optomechanical exhibit optomechanical back - action either under an external coherent injection signal laser @xcite or when the gain material has a narrowband gain @xcite .",
    "active cavities possessing mechanical degrees of freedom have been demonstrated experimentally in the context of tunable micro lasers @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the cavity length fluctuations in a vertical cavity surface emitting laser ( vcsel ) lead to a broader emission linewidth @xcite .",
    "the impact of strain waves over the light emitted by a laser cavity has also been explored and reveals the complex interaction between phonons , photons and charge carriers in active materials @xcite .",
    "here we propose an optomechanical device based on the broadband gain iii - v materials and a dissipative optomechanical coupling - essentially the mechanical displacement leads to a modulation of the cavity optical loss rate .",
    "it is shown that such combination leads to a novel coupling between the mechanical mode and the relaxation oscillations of the laser cavity .",
    "the laser - cavity response to the mechanical motion is investigated through a displacement - dependent optical resonance , as illustrated in the schematic shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . the optical frequency is written as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the bare cavity optical frequency and @xmath2 is the usual dispersive optomechanical coupling .",
    "such dispersive coupling naturally leads to a position dependent cavity loss rate , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the intrinsic optical quality factor .",
    "for example , in a fabry - perot cavity with length @xmath5 , the cavity loss rate is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the group velocity of light in the material and @xmath8 is the mirror reflectivity .",
    "therefore it is convenient to define the dissipative optomechanical coupling rate as @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "in other words , once we admit a mechanical degree of freedom to an optical cavity , its loss is modulated by the mechanical oscillation , although the optical force has a dispersive nature , generated by fluctuation of the total cavity energy . in passive high - q cavities",
    "the dissipative coupling is rather small , however active cavities display a strong intrinsic absorption and can exhibit a reasonable dissipative coupling rate . indeed it has been recently demonstrated that the mechanical brownian motion leads to linewidth broadening in vcsel lasers @xcite .

    "the laser cavity response to a small amplitude oscillation of the mechanical degree of freedom can be derived from the well - known laser rate equations @xcite for the photon number density @xmath17 and the excess carrier concentration @xmath19 , @xmath20p-\\kappa(x ) p+\\beta r_{sp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the injected carrier flux obtained either electrically or optically , @xmath22 is the elementary charge , @xmath23 is the cavity volume , @xmath24 is the spontaneous emission rate ; @xmath25 is the carrier - density dependent stimulated emission rate ; @xmath26 is the intrinsic loss rate ; @xmath27 is the fraction of the spontaneous emission coupled to the optical field . to calculate the impact of mechanically induced fluctuations on the laser dynamics we assume a small amplitude oscillation for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the static displacement , and sought for the carrier and photon density response using the ansatz , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the steady state solutions which represent the average carrier concentration and intracavity photon density .",
    "the relative photon density fluctuation @xmath35 represents the optical modulation depth displacement sensitivity . within the small signal approximation",

    ", we obtain @xmath48mhz  this current was fixed in our calculations . for higher currents the value of @xmath14 increases and @xmath49 decreases .",

    "[ fig : schematic](b ) occurs when the mechanical frequency matches the laser rof , @xmath52 , implying that the photon density fluctuations may be strongly amplified .",
    "interestingly , the phase response implies that @xmath53 leads ( lags ) @xmath54 when @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , i.e. , the mechanical frequency is red - detuned ( blue - detuned ) relative to the rof .",
    "the resonant enhancement of the optical modulation depth surrounding the relaxation oscillation frequency indicates that an oscillating optical force will drive the mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "we investigated the effects of this optical force by considering a driven harmonic mechanical oscillator , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mechanical resonance frequency , the mechanical damping rate is @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the effective motional mass and @xmath59 is the total intracavity photon number . using the ansatz @xmath29 in eq .",

    "in analogy with passive optomechanical cavities the origin of the optical spring effect ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq5 ] ) ) and optical damping ( eq.([eq : eq6 ] ) ) lies on the phase lag between the optical forces induced by the fluctuation optical intensity and the mechanical motion . here",

    "in contrast to the passive optomechanical cavities , where the spring effect can be both positive and negative , the relaxation oscillation induced spring can only soften the mechanical spring .",
    "this is expected for a purely dissipative coupling since the mechanical motion modulates the cavity loss regardlessly of the relative detuning of between the rof and the mechanical frequency .",
    "differently , the optical damping , which is related to the lag in the laser response , can be positive or negative depending on the rof detuning with respect to the mechanical frequency .    .",

    "the black points correspond to the onset of self - sustained oscillations obtained from the full numerical simulations and they are in very good agreement with the analytically calculated thresholds .",
    "the dynamical behaviour for two distinct values of @xmath76 is shown in fig.[fig : spring_damping](d , e ) for a @xmath77 mhz mechanical oscillator . in either case",
    "the relaxation oscillations of the laser decays with time and the carrier dynamics apparently reaches a steady state . for a @xmath78mhz / nm",

    "[ fig : spring_damping](e ) however , after the initial kick the mechanical oscillation amplitude grows on a time scale @xmath81 until it reaches a dynamical steady - state . at this dynamical steady - state one can notice that both the carrier and photon population are modulated at mechanical oscillator frequency .",
    "although the @xmath63 needed to achieve this simulated regime is still very large compared to what typical optomechanical systems usually provide ",
    "@xmath82ghz / nm , this novel interaction between the carriers , photons and the mechanical oscillator lead us to investigate different materials and new geometries for the experimental observation of the phenomena - iii - v - based single nanodisk have already been demonstrated and achieved experimental higher values of @xmath63 than usual systems demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the linearized results obtained previously are valid for weak dissipative coupling . in order to investigate beyond this regime",

    "the blank point corresponds to zero linewidth , i.e. , @xmath71 . ]",
    "the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues show that the damping of the mechanical oscillator is affected by the optomechanical damping such that it is possible the imaginary part becomes positive , that indicates the amplification of the mechanical oscillation .",
    "the choose of parameters was such that @xmath89 was much lower than @xmath49 ( at 980mhz , @xmath90mhz and @xmath91mhz ) , then the last one is less affected .",
    "the symmetry of the solutions is compatible with the problem of coupling two damped oscillators with the presence of gain .",
    "this problem has been explored recently showing interesting effects such as changes of the imaginary part of the frequency response and non intuitive behaviour after laser threshold@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvalues](c ) we present the real part of the solutions with thickness proportional to each imaginary part . for the condition of high coupling , such as @xmath92 , there s an anti - crossing between the solutions , typical of strong coupling @xcite .",
    "we observe that at this condition also @xmath49 is modified .",
    "the point where the mechanical solution is blanked corresponds to the condition where @xmath71 . for week coupling ,",
    "this only occurs for @xmath68 , but for strong coupling it occurs around the region of anti - crossing , due to the bigger change in the relaxation oscillation frequency . in either case ,",
    "we identify , as predicted , the resonance of @xmath14 and @xmath56 , where the first act as a cut off frequency for the amplification effect .",
    "this treatment is not adequate for the investigation of the `` blue side '' of the optomechanical laser ( @xmath93 ) , where the imaginary part is negative ; since we employed a semi classical approach , we havent included thermal bath which is necessary for the verification of the cooling of the mechanical oscillation in this region .",
    "nevertheless , previous theoretical work with appropriate quantum mechanics treatment shows that a laser cavity is inefficient in the process of cooling its own mirror when the pump is incoherent , and the process only occurs efficiently in the presence of coherent pump @xcite .",
    "our approach is suitable for the condition of incoherent pump , since injected carriers generate spontaneous emission , therefore we do nt expect this system to have efficient cooling .",
    "we have shown the existence of coupling between the laser relaxation oscillation , slightly above the threshold , and the mechanical mode , in a dissipative optomechanical resonator based on a material with optical gain .",
    "small signal analysis shows that there s a minimum coupling to achieve self - sustained oscillation near the steady state that could lead to modulation of the emitted light .",
    "the effect only occurs when @xmath68 .",
    "although the optomechanical coupling factor required to achieve this condition is higher than simulated for our devices , we expect the model to be valid for other geometries .",
    "this leads us to investigate different systems in which the minimum condition is more easily achieved .",
