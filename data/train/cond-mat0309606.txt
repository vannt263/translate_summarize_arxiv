    "symmetry considerations play a central role in the physics of low - dimensional systems , and serves as a key for understanding their peculiar properties @xcite .",
    "it predetermines their thermodynamics , response to external fields , transport properties , phase diagrams , etc . in many cases , formulating the physics of strongly interacting electrons in low dimensional systems ( especially nano - objects ) should be constructed by employing group theoretical concepts ( among them non - commutative algebras ) , whose specific structure have direct consequences for observable physical properties .",
    "it appears that not only the symmetry of a given hamiltonian but also the _ dynamical symmetry _ of low - energy excitations is relevant .    in order to clarify the above statements ,",
    "let us consider a system with hamiltonian @xmath3 whose eigenstates @xmath4 form a basis for an irreducible representation of some lie group @xmath5 ( @xmath6 enumerates the lines of this representation ) .",
    "it is convenient to express the generators of lie algebras via hubbard operators @xmath7 .",
    "then the hamiltonian under consideration is expressed in terms of diagonal hubbard operators @xmath8 so that @xmath9 = -(e_{m}-e_{m^{\\prime}})x^{\\lambda \\lambda^{\\prime}}.\\ ] ] the symmetry group of the hamiltonian is then generated by the operators @xmath10 , which commute with @xmath3 , whereas the dynamical symmetry of @xmath3 is generated by the whole set of operators @xmath11 .",
    "this dynamical symmetry may be revealed , when @xmath3 describes a quantum object , which is part of larger system with hamiltonian @xmath12 , and its symmetry is violated by interaction with this environment .",
    "if the interaction scale is characterized by some energy @xmath13 , then the dynamical symmetry is determined by transitions between those states from the manifold @xmath14 , which fall into the interval @xmath13 .",
    "we divide the hubbard operators acting within this low - energy interval into subsets @xmath15 and @xmath16 . here",
    "the @xmath17-operators generate the symmetry group @xmath5 , whereas the @xmath17- and @xmath18-operators together generate the dynamical group @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we study spin properties of quantum dots and quantum ladders , so the group @xmath5 is in fact @xmath0 , namely , the group of spin angular momentum .",
    "it will be shown that the dynamical symmetry of this object is that of the @xmath1 group .",
    "we will construct the corresponding algebras by means of hubbard operators , rewrite the corresponding hamiltonians @xmath12 in terms of the group generators , discuss the possible ways of fermionization of these hamiltonians and consider some specific properties of quantum dots and quantum ladders possesing these symmetries .",
    "the symmetry of spin rotator is an intrinsic property of many low - dimensional spin systems .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , this symmetry predetermines the low - energy dynamics of zero - dimensional quantum dots with even occupation in tunneling contact with metallic reservoirs .",
    "let us consider a double quantum dot ( dqd)occupied by two electrons in a neutral state in a t - shaped parallel geometry ( fig.1 ) as a representative example .    in this geometry ,",
    "two valleys of dqd are coupled by tunneling @xmath20 . in a limit of strong coulomb blockade @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 , the energy spectrum of an isolated dqd consists of a ground state singlet with energy @xmath23 , a spin triplet with the energy @xmath24 separated by an exchange gap @xmath25 above @xmath23 and two charge transfer excitons with large excitation energies @xmath26 , the charging energy for a given well of dqd . thus the indices @xmath27 in the hamiltonian @xmath3 ( [ hx ] ) stand for @xmath28 with @xmath29 denotes the three projections of the spin @xmath30 .",
    "the dynamical symmetry of the @xmath31 manifold is that appropriate for the @xmath32 group .",
    "two vectors generating this group are constructed by means of hubbard operators ( [ comm ] ) in the following way : @xmath33 @xmath34 the first one , @xmath35 is the conventional spin 1 operator , while the second vector is the @xmath18-operator describing @xmath36 transitions .",
    "the spin algebra is @xmath37 , which is characterized by the commutation relations @xmath38",
    "= ie_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}s_\\gamma,~[r_\\alpha , r_\\beta]=ie_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}s_\\gamma,~ [ r_\\alpha , s_\\beta]=ie_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}r_\\gamma . \\label{comm1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath39 are cartesian coordinates , @xmath40 is a levi - civita tensor ) .",
    "these vectors are orthogonal , @xmath41 , the casimir operator is @xmath42    a gate voltage @xmath43 applied to dqd , makes the level positions essentially asymmetric , and the charging energy @xmath21 may be nearly compensated for at least one of the charge transfer singlet excitons ( say , the right one , @xmath44 ) . in this case",
    "we encounter a `` coulomb resonance '' excitations , where the spin singlet and charge transfer exciton ( also a singlet ! ) are strongly intermixed , but the spin triplet is untouched by this resonance tunneling .",
    "this means that the corresponding manifold is @xmath45 . besides",
    ", one more @xmath18-vector @xmath46 and a scalar @xmath47 operators should be included in the set of group generators .",
    "these generators are expressed in terms of hubbard operators as follows : @xmath48 to close the algebra the commutation relations ( [ comm1 ] ) which are valid also for @xmath49 should be completed by @xmath50=i\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}a , [ { r}_{1\\alpha},a ] = ir_{l\\alpha } , \\label{comm2 } \\\\ & & [ a , r_{l\\alpha}]=ir_{1\\alpha},\\ ; \\;\\;[a , s_{l\\alpha}]=0 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the system of commutation relations ( [ comm1 ] ) , ( [ comm2 ] ) is that of the @xmath51 algebra , and the manifold @xmath45 obeys @xmath52 dynamical symmetry , provided all three levels are involved in the interaction within the hamiltonian h. the casimir operator for the @xmath52 group in this representation is @xmath53 .    in terms of these operators @xmath3 has the form @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the @xmath32 and the @xmath52 groups , respectively .",
    "the last terms in ( [ 1.3a ] ) and ( [ 1.3b ] ) control the number of electrons given by the operator @xmath56 in the dqd .",
    "as is seen from this equation , spin is still conserved in the isolated dqd .",
    "however , a tunnel contact with metallic leads breaks the spin rotation invariance and reveals the dynamical symmetry of the dqd .",
    "the physical mechanism of this symmetry breaking is _ electron cotunneling _ with spin flips , when an electron with spin @xmath57 enters the dqd , whereas another electron with spin @xmath58 leaves it .",
    "this process is known to be a source of kondo effect in tunnel barriers and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "eliminating charge degrees of freedom by means of the schrieffer - wolff transformation , one usually arrives at an exchange - like cotunneling hamiltonian of the type @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is a lead - dot tunneling amplitude ( which is anti - ferromagnetic , @xmath62 ) .    since @xmath63 , the kondo effect seems to be irrelevant in dqd with even occupation .",
    "however , one should remember that the tunneling @xmath61 induces additional contribution of indirect exchange between the two wells of the dqd . as is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite this contribution may change the sign of @xmath64 provided the excitation @xmath65 is soft enough , but the condition @xmath66 is still valid . then the exciton @xmath65 is eliminated from the manifold , the symmetry of the dqd reduces from @xmath52 to @xmath32 and the schrieffer - wolff transformation yields the effective spin hamiltonian @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are two indirect exchange coupling parameters which are renormalized by kondo screening .",
    "this screening affects both vectors @xmath35 and @xmath70 .",
    "the problem of kondo tunneling within the framework of the hamiltonian ( [ 1.10 ] ) has been solved in the weak coupling limit ( see @xcite and references therein ) , so we do not elaborate upon it here . for further progress it is important to note that this example demonstrates how the dynamical symmetry is realized in the s / t subspace due to interaction with the electrons in the leads , which breaks the rotational symmetry of the isolated spin system .",
    "this interaction introduces its own energy scale @xmath13 into the problem ( in example considered above it is just the kondo temperature @xmath71 ) , and the dynamical symmetry of the dqd as a spin rotator becomes relevant when the t / s energy splitting is comparable with @xmath71 . in more complicated quantum dots the spin manifolds consist of several s / t pairs , and the dynamical symmetry of such dots",
    "is described by the @xmath1 groups ( see ref .",
    "@xcite where the cases of @xmath72 are discussed ) .",
    "in this section we show that an @xmath32 symmetry is an intrinsic property of s=1/2 spin ladders and decorated spin chains ( defined below ) .",
    "a generic hamiltonian for the spin systems under consideration is of the heisenberg - type , consisting of spin 1/2 moments residing on the sites of a two leg ladder , @xmath73 here , the index @xmath74 enumerates the legs of the ladder , and the sites @xmath75 belong to the same rung ( fig.2a ) .    a chain of dimers of localized spins illustrated by fig .",
    "2b is described by the simplified version of this hamiltonian @xmath76 the geometry of alternate rungs is chosen in a system ( [ 1 ] ) to avoid exchange interaction between spins @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the transverse coupling may emerge either from direct exchange ( in case of localized spins ) or from indirect anderson - type exchange induced by tunneling ( similarly to the case encountered in qd ) . in the latter case",
    "the sign of @xmath79 is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , in the former case it may be ferromagnetic ( fm ) as well .",
    "the same is valid for @xmath80 .",
    "it is useful to start with diagonalization of the hamiltonian of a perpendicularly aligned dimer ( cf .",
    "the @xmath32 symmetry stems from the obvious fact that the spin spectrum of a dimer @xmath81 is formed by the same singlet - triplet ( st ) pair as the spin spectrum of dqd studied in the previous section .",
    "this analogy prompts us a canonical transformation connecting two pairs of spin vectors , @xmath82 and @xmath83 : the two sets of spin operators are connected by a simple rotation @xmath84 then the hamiltonian @xmath85 of a single dimer @xmath86 is the same as the hamiltonian ( [ 1.3a ] ) of dqd .",
    "the total spin of a dimer is not conserved in such a spin chain , so the dynamical symmetry of an individual rung is revealed by the modes propagating along the chain @xcite . applying the rotation operation ( [ rot ] ) to the hamiltonians ( [ spl ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) , we transform them into an equivalent form @xmath87 here",
    "@xmath88 is common for both models .",
    "it is useful to include the zeeman term in @xmath85 , @xmath89 we confine ourselves by a charge sector @xmath90 and omit the coulomb blockade term for the sake of brevity .",
    "the interaction part of the sl hamiltonian transforms under rotation ( [ rot ] ) to the following expression @xmath91 the interaction part of the src hamiltonian is @xmath92 one may also consider the _ alternate src model _ ( asrc , see fig . [",
    "fig2](c ) ) .",
    "after an appropriate rotation ( [ rot])its interaction hamiltonian acquires the form @xmath93 now we see that all three effective hamiltonians belong to the same family . in all cases the initial ladder or `` semi - ladder '' hamiltonian is transformed into a one - dimensional spin - chain hamiltonian , which , however , takes into account the hidden symmetry of a dimer",
    ". the effective hamiltonians ( [ i.2a ] ) , ( [ i.2 ] ) , ( [ i.5 ] ) contain operators @xmath70 describing the dynamical symmetry of the dimers .",
    "this dynamical symmetry turns the spectrum of this hamiltonians to be richer than that of a standard heisenberg chain . like in many other cases ,",
    "rotation transformation eliminates the antisymmetric combination of two generators .",
    "thus , the transformation ( [ rot ] ) reveals the hidden symmetry of a spin 1/2 ladder ( [ i.2a ] ) .",
    "it maps the hamiltonian onto a pair of coupled chain hamiltonians : one is the conventional spin 1 chain , while the other is a pseudospin chain .",
    "a spin @xmath94 and a pseudospin @xmath95 are kinematically coupled by the commutation relations and by the local casimir constraint @xmath96    one may also compare the hamiltonian ( [ i.2a ] ) with the effective hamiltonian of a spin 1 chain , which arises after decomposition of spin - one operators into a pair of spin 1/2 operators , @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "this decomposition operation transforms the initial hamiltonian into a form similar to @xmath98 but for spin - one - half operators @xmath99 .",
    "the difference between the two cases is that these effective spins commute , ( unlike operators @xmath100 ) . in other words ,",
    "the difference is that the local symmetry of spin - one chain is @xmath101 whereas the local symmetry of src is @xmath32 .",
    "the spin rotator chains ( [ i.2 ] ) , ( [ i.5 ] ) are in some sense intermediate between spin chains and spin ladders . in these cases the spin - pseudospin symmetry is obviously broken by the cross terms @xmath102 .",
    "the excitation spectrum of spin ladders may be calculated in terms of operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "for example , the well known expression for a gap @xmath103 in excitation spectrum in the limit of strong transversal exchange @xmath104 for afm interaction @xcite looks like @xmath105 ( here @xmath106 and @xmath107 stand for possible triplet projections and spin states at the sites @xmath108 , respectively ) .",
    "the singlet - triplet excitations above this gap are given by the dispersion law @xmath109 .",
    "in all cases the simplified versions of heisenberg hamiltonians may be considered .",
    "the simplified sl models are well known @xcite .",

    "then at low t , the states @xmath114 and @xmath115 are quenched , and only two components , @xmath116 survive in the manifold ( [ m.1 ] ) , ( [ sp ] ) . as a result",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ i.2 ] ) is mapped onto a @xmath117-model for spin 1/2 : @xmath118 this means that starting from a singlet ground state for @xmath119 , one may induce development of spin liquid - like excitations by applying strong magnetic field . in a near vicinity of this point of degeneracy , @xmath120 acquire the features of _ xy model in transverse magnetic field_.",
    "to describe the elementary excitations in src , one should generalize the @xmath0-like semi - fermionic representation for @xmath17 operators @xcite @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 denote creation operators for fermions with spin `` up '' and `` down '' respectively whereas @xmath125 stands for spinless fermion @xcite .",

    "of general effective hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest of all is the case ( [ i.5 ] ) .",
    "the problem is reduced to a standard xy - model for spin one half , and the spinon spectrum may be easily obtained either by bosonization or by spinon - type fermionisation . in former case one deals with hard - core bosons , and in latter one the problem is mapped onto the non - interacting incompressible fermions at half - filling .",

    "has one more gap mode , where the gap equals @xmath79 .",

    "( [ anom ] ) . apparently , the one more channel ( tripet / singlet transitions in @xmath143 ) enhances this effect , because in this case the local constraint imposes more restrictions of phase fluctuations .",
    "the gap itself is due to anomalous correlations described by the second line of eq .",
    "( [ anom ] ) . here",
    "the appearance of second channel of spinless excitations results in formation of even and odd operators @xmath145 and @xmath146 . the haldane gap closes when the @xmath147 and @xmath148 states are degenerate ( the odd operator @xmath146 nullifies the anomalous terms responsible for its formation ) .",
    "this means that appearance of @xmath149 channel _ favors _ closing of the haldane gap .",

    "we show that the _ dynamical _ @xmath52 group arises in description of heisenberg ladder , but excitonic states are involved in this symmetry instead of cooper states .    let us consider a two - leg quantum ladder depicted in fig.2a under condition of strong coulomb blockade imposed on each rung @xmath86 .",
    "we allow electron tunneling @xmath153 along both legs .",
    "this tunneling is described by the hamiltonian @xmath154 ( only a nearest - neighbor hopping along the leg is allowed ) .",

[ 1.3b ] ) , and the terms with excess electron and excess hole should be added .",

    "<S> quite generally , dynamical symmetries are realizable in the space of low energy excited states in a given charge sector of nanoobjects , which involve spin variables and/or electron - hole pairs . while spin multiplets in an individual rung of a ql or in an isolated cqd form a representation space of the usual rotation group , this @xmath0 symmetry is broken due to spin transfer ( in ql ) electron cotunneling through cqd . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical symmetries in the space of spin multiplets are then unravelled in these processes . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding symmetry groups are described by @xmath1 or @xmath2 depending on the origin of rotation group symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the effective spin hamiltonians of ql and cqd are derived and expressed in terms of the pertinent group generators . </S>",
    "<S> we employ fermionization procedure for analyzing the physical content of these dynamical symmetries , including kondo tunneling through cqd and haldane gap formation in ql . </S>"
