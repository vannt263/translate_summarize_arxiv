    "the formation and the properties of random structures have been an exciting topic in statistical physics for many years . in the case",
    "that the formation of such structures obeys local rules , these processes can often be expressed in the language of epidemic spreading .",
    "it is well - known that two special spreading processes referred to in this language respectively as simple epidemic with recovery or gribov process @xcite and epidemic with removal ( general epidemic process ) lead to random structures with the properties of percolation clusters : directed percolation @xcite in the former case and isotropic percolation in the latter .",
    "the gribov process , also known in elementary particle physics as reggeon field theory ( rft ) @xcite , is a stochastic multiparticle process that describes the essential features of a vast number of growth phenomena of populations without exploitation of the environment near their extinction threshold .",
    "the transition between survival and extinction of the population ( infected individuals ) is a nonequilibrium continuous phase transition phenomenon and is characterized by universal scaling laws .",
    "the gribov process belongs to the universality class of local growth processes with absorbing states @xcite such as the contact process @xcite and certain cellular automata @xcite , and it is relevant to a vast range of models in physics , chemistry , biology , and sociology . as usual , we refer to this universality class as the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a continuum description of dp in terms of a density @xmath5 of infected individuals typically arises from a coarse - graining procedure in which a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom are averaged out .",
    "their influence is simply modelled as a gaussian noise - term in a langevin equation .",
    "the process has to respect the absorbing state condition : @xmath6 is always a stationary state .",
    "then the minimal stochastic reaction - diffusion equation for the density @xmath7 is constructed as @xcite@xmath8   \\,n\\left (   \\mathbf{r},t\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\zeta\\left (   \\mathbf{r},t\\right)\\ , .",
    "\\label{langgl}\\ ] ] the gaussian noise @xmath9 must also respect the absorbing state condition , whence @xmath10 up to subleading contributions .",
    "the history of the process in space and time defines directed percolation clusters in a ( @xmath11)-dimensional space . the minimal process defined by eqs .",
    "( [ langgl ] ) and ( [ langnoise ] ) contains all the relevant terms needed for a proper field theoretic description of dp .    in realistic situations",
    "the infection can be also long - ranged .",
    "one may think , e.g. , of an orchard where flying parasites contaminate the trees practically instantaneous in a widespread manner if the timescale of the flights of the parasites is much shorter than the mesoscopic timescale of the epidemic process itself .",
    "thus , following a suggestion of mollison @xcite , grassberger @xcite introduced a variation of the epidemic processes with an infection probability distribution @xmath12 which decays with the distance @xmath1 as a power law , @xmath13 .",
    "we will somewhat casually refer to such long - range infection as lvy - flights although a true lvy - flight is defined via its fourier transform as @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( to ensure positiveness of the distribution ) .",
    "in fourier space and in a long - wavelength expansion , the langevin equation  ( [ langgl ] ) can be generalized to account for lvy - flights by a term proportional to @xmath16 . in the case of @xmath17 , the long - wavelength behavior",
    "is naively dominated by this new term .",
    "grassberger calculated critical exponents in a 1-loop calculation which were discontinuous in the limit @xmath18 , and therefore the applicability of the results was doubtful . in a former paper @xcite ,",
    "we have shown by applying the wilson momentum shell renormalization group that only two of the critical exponents are independent in long - range dp , and that the critical exponents change continuously when the transition line between long - ranged and short - ranged spreading ( with an @xmath19 ) is crossed .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath20 exactly , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the usual exponents of short - ranged dp in @xmath0 ( transversal ) dimensions .",
    "these results have been confirmed numerically by hinrichsen and howard @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath25 , which corresponds to the fisher - exponent of equilibrium critical phenomena , is negativ here @xcite .",
    "for a recent review for dp with long - range interactions see  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we reconsider the problem using methods of renormalized field theory in conjunction with an expansion in @xmath4 and @xmath26 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : model ] reviews the field theoretic formulation of dp with lvy - flight spreading to set the stage , to provide background information and to establish notation .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] first reviews the short - range limit of this model and then discusses our field theoretic analysis of the long - range limit .",
    "section  [ sec : hybridmodel ] represents the main part of this paper .",
    "it treats in detail the hybrid model for @xmath27 .",
    "section  [ sec : criticalbehavior ] builds up on the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : hybridmodel ] and present results for the critical exponents and logarithmic corrections of various dynamical observables .",

    "of course this pole is a non - physical ghost ; it arises when the long - wavelength approximation is used in a momentum regime where it is inapplicable .",
    "this happens in particular in dimensional regularization where integrations over internal momenta are extended to infinity .",
