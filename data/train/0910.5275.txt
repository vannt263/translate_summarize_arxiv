    "game theory is a powerful mathematical tool to analyze various natural and social phenomena @xcite . after the publication of meyer @xcite ,",
    "there has been a great deal of effort to extend the classical game theory into the quantum domain , and it has been shown that quantum games may have significant advantages over their classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "the classical game theory includes a fatal drawback , namely , the multiplicity of equilibria .",
    "battle of sexes , chicken game , and stag hunt are famous examples of games with multiple equilibria . for a game possessing multiple equilibria",
    ", the classical game theory can say nothing about the predictability of the outcome of the game : there is no particular reason to single one out of these equilibria . until the present ,",
    "several quantum extensions are considered to resolve this problem , e.g. , battle of sexes @xcite , chicken game @xcite , and stag hunt @xcite .",
    "we also attack this problem by analyzing a quantum extension of a game which describes market competition .    in economics",
    ", many important markets are neither perfectly competitive nor perfectly monopolistic , that is , the action of individual firms affect the market price @xcite .",
    "these markets are usually called _",
    "oligopolistic _ and can be analyzed based on game theory .",
    "recently , li et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the quantization of games with continuous strategic space , a classic instance of which is the cournot duopoly @xcite , in which firms compete on the amount of output they will produce , which they decide on independently of each other and at the same time .",
    "@xcite showed that the firms can escape the frustrating dilemma  like situation if the structure involves a maximally entangled state . a key feature in li et al .",
    "@xcite is the linearity assumption , that is , both the cost function and the inverse demand function are linear . it is well known that linear cournot games have exactly one equilibrium @xcite . on the other hand , in nonlinear settings , there may be multiple equilibria , and hence we may not predict the market price . a natural question is whether the uniqueness of equilibria is guaranteed in the quantum cournot duopoly ? we are trying to answer this question in this paper . to quantize the model",
    ", we apply li et al.s @xcite `` minimal '' quantization rules to cournot duopoly in a nonlinear setting , where there are one symmetric equilibrium and two asymmetric equilibria in the zero entanglement case .",
    "we observe the transition of the game from purely classical to fully quantum , as the game s entanglement increases from zero to maximum .",
    "we show that if the entanglement of the game is sufficiently large , then all asymmetric equilibria vanish and there remains one symmetric equilibrium . furthermore , similar to li et al .",
    "@xcite , in the maximally entangled game , the unique symmetric equilibrium is exactly pareto optimal . in other words , the multiplicity of equilibria as well as",
    "the dilemma  like situation in the classical cournot duopoly is completely resolved in our quantum extension .",
    "we consider cournot competition between two firms , firm @xmath0 and firm @xmath1 .",
    "they simultaneously decide the quantity @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , of a homogenous product they want to put on the market .",
    "let @xmath4 be the inverse demand function , where @xmath5 .",
    "each firm @xmath6 has the common cost function @xmath7 .",
    "then the firm @xmath8 s profit can be written as @xmath9 we assume that @xmath10 where @xmath11 .    given any @xmath3 , we have @xmath12 .",
    "thus , to maximize her profit , firm @xmath0 chooses @xmath2 such that @xmath13 , that is , @xmath14    similarly , given any @xmath2 , firm @xmath1 chooses @xmath3 such that @xmath15 a pair @xmath16 is a nash equilibrium iff it solves eq .",
    "( [ foc1 ] ) and ( [ foc2 ] ) . then , there are three equilibria , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . at these equilibria",
    "the profits are @xmath19    however , these equilibria fail to be pareto optimal .",
    "the reason why they fail is that both firms can be better off by jointly decreasing their outputs , since @xmath20 and @xmath21 at equilibria . on the other hand ,",
    "if the two firms can cooperate and restrict their quantities to @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then they can maximize their joint profit @xmath25 ( obviously @xmath26 is pareto optimal ) .",
    "for example , @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the joint profit at @xmath26 is greater than that of any equilibrium .    with regard to the asymmetric equilibria ,",
    "the situation is similar to that of chicken game if we correspond the equilibria @xmath29 respectively to the equilibria @xmath30 @xmath31 in chicken game .",
    "below we will see that , as the measure of entanglement goes to infinitely large in a quantum form of cournot competition , the unique equilibrium comes to be optimal , as if the unique cooperative equilibrium is attained in chicken game @xcite .",
    "to model cournot duopoly on a quantum domain , we follow li et al.s `` minimal '' extension , which utilizes two single  mode electromagnetic fields , of which the quadrature amplitudes have a continuous set of eigenstates . the tensor product of two single  mode vacuum states @xmath32 is identified as the starting state of the cournot game , and the state consequently undergoes a unitary entanglement operation @xmath33 , in which @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the electromagnetic field modes .",
    "the operation is assumed to be known to both firms and to be symmetric with respect to the interchange of the two field modes .",
    "the resultant state is given by @xmath38 .",
    "then firm @xmath0 and firm @xmath1 execute their strategic moves via the unitary operations @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , which correspond to the quantum version of the strategies of the cournot game .",
    "the final measurement is made , after these moves are finished and a disentanglement operation @xmath41 is carried out .",
    "the final state prior to the measurement , thus , is @xmath42 .",
    "the measured observables are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and the measurement is done by the homodyne measurement with an infinitely squeezed reference light beam ( i.e. , the noise is reduced to zero ) . when quantum entanglement is not present , namely @xmath45 ,",
    "this quantum structure faithfully represent the classical game , and the final measurement provides the original classical results : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . otherwise , namely when quantum entanglement is present , the quantities the two firms will produce are determined by @xmath48 note that the classical model can be recovered by choosing @xmath49 to be zero , since the two firms can directly decide their quantities . on the other hand , both @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are determined by @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",
    "it leads to the correlation between the firms .    substituting @xmath53 into eq .",
    "( [ clapay ] ) provides the quantum profits @xmath54 for firm @xmath8 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57    similar to the classical game , we also have @xmath58 for any @xmath59 . to maximize her profit ,",
    "thus , firm @xmath8 chooses @xmath60 such that @xmath61 , that is , @xmath62 solving eq .",
    "( [ foc3 ] ) for both firms provides the quantum nash equilibria , and the symmetric one is uniquely given as @xmath63 where @xmath64 . as easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ symnash ] ) , the quantity produced by each firm in the equilibrium , equals to @xmath65 , monotonically increases and approaches to the pareto optimal one @xmath66 , as the entanglement @xmath49 increases .",
    "in fact , given @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 , and thus , @xmath70    as we have observed above , in addition to the symmetric one there are two asymmetric equilibria in the classical model .",
    "hence , it is expected that the quantum model also possesses asymmetric equilibria at least as far as the entanglement is not too large .",
    "in fact , we can see that this conjecture is valid for the case of @xmath28 as follows . by substituting @xmath60 with @xmath53 , eq .",
    "( [ foc3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath71 @xmath72 is a locus of quantities , which is determined by firm @xmath8 s best response strategy @xmath60 to the opponent s strategy @xmath59 .",
    "each intersection of @xmath73 and @xmath74 represents quantities produced in some equilibrium .",
    "[ figbr ] depicts @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     fig . [ figbr ]",
    "displays that the number of equilibria varies as @xmath49 changes .",
    "[ figbr](i ) corresponds to the classical model , where there are three equilibria .",
    "[ figbr](ii ) , in which five equilibria exist , shows the possibility that the number of equilibria increases by the existence of the entanglement . in fig .",
    "[ figbr](iii ) , asymmetric equilibria disappear and the only one symmetric equilibrium remains . evidently from these figures",
    ", there is the possibility of multiple equilibria even if the entanglement exists .",
    "however , we can prove that asymmetric equilibria vanish when @xmath49 goes large .",
    "for a sufficiently large @xmath49 , @xmath76 is the unique equilibrium .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the quantifier `` sufficiently large '' in the proposition is not so restrictive by the following reason . to obtain the proposition , we use the fact that @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath79 converges very quickly , the lower bound for @xmath49 , which guarantees the uniqueness of equilibria , is not so large .",
    "for instance , any asymmetric equilibrium can not exist for @xmath80 when @xmath81 ( as we will see below in fig .",
    "[ figpayoff ] ) .",
    "finally , we consider the transition of equilibria of the game from purely classical to fully quantum , as @xmath49 increases from zero to infinity .",
    "[ figpayoff ] depicts the transition process for the case of @xmath28 and @xmath82 : the number of equilibria changes , as @xmath49 grows large , from 3 to 5 , from 5 to 3 , and from 3 to 1 at last .",
    "more precisely , there are two thresholds , namely @xmath83 and @xmath84 : for @xmath85 , there are three equilibria ; for @xmath86 , there are five ; for @xmath87 , there are three ; and for @xmath88 , the symmetric ( and unique ) one remains .",
    "the horizontal line at 11.75 ( @xmath89 ) represents the half of the maximum joint profit , and the line at 10 represents the profit at the symmetric nash equilibrium of the classical cournot game . as easily seen from the figure , asymmetric equilibria vanish and the unique symmetric equilibrium monotonically approaches to the optimal one as @xmath49 goes large .     the profits at quantum nash equilibria as a function of the entanglement parameter @xmath49 , where @xmath28 and @xmath82 .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "given a sufficiently large @xmath49 , let @xmath16 be equilibrium outputs .",
    "suppose to the contrary , @xmath90 .",
    "then , eq . ( [ br ] ) implies : @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "subtracting eq .",
    "( [ foc4 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ foc5 ] ) , we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "it implies @xmath95 since we assume that @xmath96 , @xmath97 , that is , @xmath98 it is necessary for eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) having a real solution that @xmath99 which implies that @xmath100 must be sufficiently close to zero since @xmath77 as @xmath101 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) is given by @xmath102    on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ foc4 ] ) implies that @xmath103 since @xmath104 and @xmath105 as @xmath101 , we obtain @xmath106 which implies that @xmath107 is bounded away from zero , a contradiction .",
    "thus , for a sufficiently large @xmath49 , any equilibrium must be symmetric .",
