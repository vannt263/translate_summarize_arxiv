    "in its very short life time the hitomi x - ray observatory has revealed extremely valuable information on the nature of the intracluster medium ( icm ) of the perseus cluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the analysis of hitomi x - ray observations by @xcite show a relatively quiescent icm .",
    "the hot gas has a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath0 in the region @xmath1 to @xmath2 from the central nucleus .",
    "this implies that the heating of the icm by dissipation of turbulence energy can not offset radiative cooling .",
    "another heating mechanism is at work in the perseus cluster .",
    "the heating process of the icm in cooling flows in clusters and groups of galaxies and in galaxies operates in a negative feedback cycle ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the energy from the mass - accreting super massive black hole is carried to the icm by jets ( or collimated wind ) , hence it is termed the jet feedback mechanism ( jfm ) .",
    "several processes have been proposed to transfer the energy from the jets to the icm ( e.g. , @xcite ) , some of which can act together , e.g. , cosmic rays and thermal conduction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argues that sound waves , as inferred from the ripples in perseus @xcite , that are excited by jet - inflated bubbles @xcite are more efficient in transferring energy than weak shocks are . @xcite",
    "apply the sound wave heating mechanism to the perseus cluster following the hitomi observations .",
    "@xcite propose that shocks heat the icm in the virgo cluster , while @xcite argue that shocks excited by periodic jets activity heat the icm of the galaxy group ngc  5813 .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , found problems in the process of shocks - heating of the icm of ngc  5813 .",
    "more generally , @xcite and @xcite found in their two - dimensional numerical simulations , that mixing of the hot bubble gas with the icm is much more significant than heating by shocks . @xcite and @xcite already discussed heating by mixing of the hot bubble gas with the icm .",
    "however , their simulations were unrealistic as they injected artificial bubbles , and mixing was achieved by the destruction of the bubbles by instabilities .",
    "the new simulations @xcite show the bubbles to survive for a long time , and show that jets induce vortices inside and outside the hot bubbles .",
    "these are the vortices that cause the efficient mixing of the hot bubble gas with the icm .",
    "another heating mechanism is by dissipation of turbulence in the icm ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or heating by turbulence and turbulent - mixing ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "based on x - ray observation @xcite argue that dissipation of icm turbulence is the main heating process of the icm in the virgo and perseus cooling flow clusters .",
    "@xcite deduce , based on numerical simulations , that turbulence can not be the main heating source .",
    "@xcite , based on idealized simulations with artificial bubble injection ( namely , not with jet ) , reach a similar conclusion .",
    "cosmic rays can also heat the icm ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including the icm in perseus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argues that mixing of cosmic rays that fill the jet - inflated bubbles with the icm is essential for heating by cosmic rays .    in an earlier paper @xcite we conducted three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jet - inflated bubbles in the icm . for the parameters used in those simulations",
    ", we found the mixing by vortices to be the main heating mechanism ( mixing - heating ) .",
    "we found that the mixing process accounts for @xmath3 of the energy transferred from the jets to the icm .",
    "kinetic energy of the icm carries about @xmath4 of the energy that is deposited by the jets to the icm .",
    "only a fraction of the kinetic energy develops to icm turbulence and sound waves .",
    "the other fraction of the kinetic energy is in large scale flows .",
    "shocks play only a minor role in heating the icm . based on our earlier findings , as inferred from the fraction of kinetic energy",
    ", it seems that sound waves also play a minor role .",
    "@xcite performed three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for a much longer time , and also found that mixing is the main heating process .",
    "they found though , that heating by shocks is the second important process and turbulent heating contributes a small fraction .",
    "we note that turbulence can play a role in determining the properties of the icm ( e.g. , @xcite ) even when it is not the main heating source .    in any case , turbulence in the icm",
    "is expected as a by product of the mixing process that is induced by vortices @xcite .",
    "this expectation from numerical simulations is compatible with findings of turbulence in the icm of some cooling flows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "following the results of hitomi @xcite we conduct further analysis of our 3d numerical simulations .",
    "although the simulations from @xcite were not aiming at the perseus cluster , the reanalysis of our simulations further strengthens our conclusion that heating by mixing process is the main heating process .",
    "we analyze the 3d hydrodynamical simulations that were presented in our earlier paper @xcite , where more details on the numerical scheme and convergence tests can be found .",
    "we present here only the main features of the numerical code .",
    "we use the pluto code @xcite for the hydrodynamic simulations , in a three - dimensional cartesian grid with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) .",
    "the computational grid is in the octant where the three coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positive . at the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 planes we apply reflective boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath7 coordinate is chosen along the initial axis of the jets .",
    "in reality two opposite jets are launched simultaneously , such that the flow here is assumed to be symmetric with respect to the @xmath10 plane , amounting to reflective boundary conditions at @xmath10 .",
    "the base computational grid ( lowest amr level ) spans the cube @xmath11 , with @xmath12 divisions in each direction . up to @xmath13 amr levels",
    "are employed with a refinement ratio of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the highest resolution is @xmath15 .    on the outer boundaries we use an outflow boundary condition . at the boundary @xmath10",
    "we inject into the grid a jet with a half - opening angle of @xmath16 .",
    "the jet material is inserted through a circle @xmath17 on the @xmath10 plane with a radius of @xmath18 . the initial jet velocity in the nominal case , the case we will present here , is @xmath19 , a mach number of about @xmath20 .",
    "the direction of the velocity at each injection point @xmath21 in the circle is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the jet is injected during each active episode , and when the jet is turned off reflective boundary conditions apply in the whole @xmath10 plane .",
    "the power of the two jets together during each on - episode is @xmath24 .",
    "the mass deposition rate is thus @xmath25 .",
    "the jet is periodically turned on for @xmath26 and off for @xmath26 .",
    "the simulation begins with an isothermal box of gas at an initial temperature of @xmath27 with a density profile of ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath28 ^ { 3 / 4}},\\ ] ] with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a gravity field is added to maintain an initial hydrostatic equilibrium , and is kept constant in time .",
    "we include radiative cooling in the simulations , where the tabulated cooling function is taken from the solar - metalicity values of table 6 in @xcite .",
    "vortices that are induced by the jets and the jet - inflated bubbles play a crucial role in the interaction of the jets with the icm @xcite . in particular , they lead to mixing of hot bubble gas with the icm .",
    "this mixing heats the icm in a process termed mixing - heating . to demonstrate vortices , we present only two examples from @xcite ; figures 4 and 5 there .",
    "more details can be found there , as well as more cases in earlier papers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in figs .  [",
    "figure : tracers tr4 ] and [ figure : tracers tr3 ] we present the flow pattern in the meridional plane ( perpendicular to the symmetry plane ) at two times in each figure , together with the concentration of traced gas .",
    "the scale of the flow arrows and the initial location of the tracer are described in the figure captions .",
    "the tracers are artificial flow quantities frozen - in to the flow , and hence represent the spreading with time of gas starting in a certain volume .",
    "a tracer s initial value is set to @xmath31 in a certain volume and @xmath32 elsewhere .",
    "if the traced gas is mixed with the icm or the jet s material , its value drops to @xmath33 .    figs .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr4 ] and [ figure : tracers tr3 ] demonstrate the complicated flow pattern with many vortices , that is induced by the jets and the bubbles , and the vigorous mixing that takes place",
    ". the vortices also induce sound waves @xcite and turbulence @xcite .",
    "we now turn to examine the velocity dispersion of this complicated flow .",
    "although we did not aim to study the perseus cluster in the simulations we present here ( conducted in 2015 before the hitomi observations ) , the parameters used here are not too different than those of perseus .",
    "the initial temperature in our simulations is @xmath27 , just a little lower than the icm temperature in perseus @xcite .",
    "the density in the inner region is as observed in perseus , @xmath34 for the electron number density .",
    "the average power of the two jets in the present simulations is @xmath35 , while that of the jets in perseus , as inferred from the cavities @xcite , is @xmath36 .",
    "so we might even overestimate the velocity dispersion in perseus .",
    "we do note that @xcite require that the power in sound waves in their suggested heating mechanism be @xmath37 at r=@xmath38 , not much different than the power of the jets in our simulation .",
    "we follow the evolution of the line of sight root mean square ( rms ) of the velocity of the two tracers and of the gas in the grid .",
    "the rms numerical velocity along the line of sight , termed here numerical velocity dispersion , is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for one of the two tracers or the grid , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the kinetic energy and mass , respectively .",
    "we present the line - of - sight rms velocity for gas at @xmath43 , which is basically the icm , and for gas at @xmath44 which is the shocked jet s material .",
    "the relevant quantity to compare with hitomi is the icm gas .    in figs .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr4 ] and [ figure : tracers tr3 ] we show the evolution of the line - of - sight rms velocity for @xmath45 and @xmath46 that were defined in figs .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr4 ] , and in fig .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr3 ] . in fig .",
    "[ figure : tracergrid ] we show the numerical velocity dispersion for the entire gas in the grid , according to its temperature . in calculating the numerical velocity dispersion of the gas in the grid we consider all the gas that is located inside the numerical grid at a given time .",
    "we do not count gas that has already left the grid . as we inject more jet s material",
    ", high velocity gas replaces lower velocity gas that has left the grid .",
    "this is the explanation for the increase in the numerical velocity dispersion in the grid that is seen in the left panel of figure [ figure : tracergrid ] .",
    "had we continued the simulation for a longer time , we would have reach a steady state .",
    "+     +     +    for these simulation we @xcite found that the main heating of the icm is by mixing .",
    "only @xmath47 of the energy is carried by kinetic energy that is distributed among shock waves , sound waves , and global flow .",
    "we find that the line - of - sight rms velocity is in the range of @xmath48 , compatible with the finding from hitomi observations of a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we consider this compatibility to strengthen our conclusion that heating - mixing is more significant than heating by turbulence and sound waves .",
    "vortices that cause the heating - mixing , excite also sound waves and turbulence , and hence we expect the presence of these in the icm .",
    "the hitomi x - ray observations of the perseus cluster show that dissipation of turbulent energy can not be the main heating mechanism of the icm .",
    "this result , that was anticipated by some studies , leaves three potential heating mechanisms of the icm in the perseus cluster of galaxies .",
    "these heating processes are the dissipation of sound waves @xcite , cosmic rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and mixing - heating , where hot gas from jet - inflated bubbles is mixed with the icm @xcite .",
    "we note that heating by cosmic rays and mixing - heating are not excluded , as @xcite argued that mixing is essential for the heating by cosmic rays model to account for observations .",
    "vortices that are formed in the interaction of the jets with the icm excite both the sound waves @xcite and cause the mixing @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite we found that the main heating mechanism of the icm is mixing - heating .",
    "the kinetic energy deposited to the icm by the jets and the bubbles they inflate is about one quarter of the energy deposited by mixing .",
    "the kinetic energy includes also the global flow of the gas , such that the energy carried by sound waves and turbulence is less than @xmath49 of the thermal energy deposited to the icm by mixing .",
    "then there are still uncertainties about the dissipation rate of sound waves in the icm @xcite .",
    "if the dissipation length is large , then only a fraction of the energy that is carried by the sound waves will be dissipated in the cooling flow region in perseus . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argued that the dissipation length of sound waves is too short , and the energy will be deposited only in the central region of the cooling flow .",
    "we can summarize our view on the heating process of the icm in perseus , based on our numerical simulations and the new result of hitomi , in the following way .",
    "the inflation of bubbles by jets in the icm is accompanied by shocks that run through the icm and by many vortices inside and outside the jet - inflated bubbles .",
    "the vortices excite sounds waves and turbulence , and lead to mixing of hot post - shock jets material , the hot bubble gas , with the icm .",
    "all four processes , shocks , dissipation of sound waves , dissipation of turbulence , and mixing , contribute to the heating of the icm .",
    "our finding is that mixing - heating contributes the most , more than @xmath50 of the heating , including mixing of cosmic rays .",
    "the rest , less than @xmath47 , and possibly more likely @xmath51 , is contributed by the other three processes that must be present , as they are by products of the inflation of bubbles .    for computational resources",
