    "the radiative lifetimes of exciton in lens - shaped inas / inp and inas / gaas qds are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig - x - xx ] ( a ) .",
    "the major differences between the two dots are : ( i ) the exciton lifetime in inas / inp is almost twice longer than that of inas / gaas for flat qds .",
    "there are two reasons for the longer lifetime in inas / inp qds .",
    "first , inas / inp qds have smaller exciton energies and second , inas / inp qds have much smaller dipole moment , because the electrons are less confined .",
    "experimentally , the lifetimes of @xmath33 and @xmath28 in inas / gaas qds are found to be around 0.8 - 1.2 ns , @xcite very close to the calculated results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - x - xx ] .",
    "the measured exciton lifetimes in inas / inp qds by sasakura _",
    "et al_,@xcite are about 2.0 ns , which also agree very well with the calculated values in this work .",
    "( ii ) the exciton lifetime in inas / inp qds decreases with increasing of the dot height . in the inas / gaas qds ,",
    "the opposite trend is found , because the hole wave functions localize more on the interface of the dots .",
    "@xcite ( iii ) for flat qds ( @xmath75 nm ) , we find that the exciton lifetime in inas / gaas dots is almost independent of the dot diameter .",
    "however , in inas / inp qds , the exciton lifetime depends strongly on the dot diameter .",
    "for example , when @xmath76 nm , @xmath23= 2.5 nm , @xmath77= 2.26 ns . when we increase @xmath24 to 25 nm , @xmath77 decrease to 2.04 ns .",
    "this is also due to the weak confinement potential for electrons in the inas / inp qds . increasing the diameter of a qd results in more confined electron state , and thus lager overlap between electron and hole wave functions and lager dipole moment .",
    "we further compare the lifetimes of biexciton in fig .",
    "[ fig - x - xx ] ( b ) , and of charged exciton between the two dots in fig .",
    "[ fig - xe - xh ] .",
    "the values of lifetime for these exciton complexes are very different .",
    "however the trends of lifetimes as functions of dot geometry are rather similar . roughly speaking , the charged excitons ( @xmath26 , @xmath26 ) and @xmath33 have lifetimes about twice longer than the biexciton , @xcite i.e. , @xmath78      the studies of electron / hole filling process in self - assembled qds are stimulated by the experiments that allow the electron / hole be loaded into the qds one by one and measure the charging energies.@xcite unlike the atoms , where large coulomb interaction @xmath79 ev ensure the hund s rule ( maximum spin ) and aufbau principle . in self - assembled qds , the coulomb interaction is about 20 - 25 mev for electron - electron interaction and 15 - 20 mev for hole - hole interaction , which is the same order of the energy level spacings in qds .",
    "so , the electron / hole filling process should be quite different from that in atoms . in strongly confined qds ( dimeter @xmath80 3 nm )",
    ", it is found that hund s rule is generally obeyed , but violation of the aufbau principle is a common feature when single - particle energy levels separated by a few mev.@xcite in the self - assembled inas / gaas qds , he _ et al_@xcite found that it is possible for holes to violate both the hund s rule and the aufbau principe , which is confirmed by the pl spectra of highly charged excitons @xmath81 and @xmath82 by ediger _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "let us first look at the charging energy and addition energy of the qds , which can be measured directly in the experiments .",
    "the charging energy @xmath83 , measures the energy needed to load an additional carrier into the qds . the addition energy is the energy difference between @xmath84 and @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 . in the hartree - fock approximation",

    "[ fig : addition ] ( b ) , ( d ) for inas / inp qds , respectively . the electron addition energies of inas / inp qds are much smaller than those of inas / gaas qds of similar sizes",
    ". however , the hole addition energies of inas / inp qds are much larger than those of inas / gaas qds due to their much larger single - particle level spacings , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - energy - diag ] .",
    "more interestingly , where the hole addition energy in inas / gaas qds show two peaks at @xmath87=3 and 5 , the hole addition energy in inas / inp qds show only a strong peak at @xmath87=3 , which is similar to that of electrons .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the hole energy levels have well defined shell structure in inas / inp qds , but not in inas / gaas qds .",
    "we further look at the filling orders of the electron / hole in the inas / inp qds .",
    "the filling orders of electrons and holes in qds are determined by the following factors : @xcite ( i ) the single - particle energy level spacing , ( ii ) the @xmath25 , @xmath91 energy level splittings and ( iii ) the coulomb interactions .",

    "for @xmath81 , we find that the hybridization effect in inas / inp is much stronger than that in inas / gaas qds .",
    "for example , in inas / inp qds , @xmath122 = 56% , much smaller than 84% in inas / gaas qds .",
    "this giant difference is from the smaller @xmath25 level energy splitting in inas / inp qds , as illustrated in fig .",

    "for example , in the inas / gaas qds , @xmath124 has a close shell ground state,@xcite and therefore no polarization dependent photoluminescence .",
    "in contrast , @xmath124 of inas / inp qds has a open shell ground state , and therefore has polarization dependent photoluminescence .",
    "furthermore , there are many more transition peaks due to the spin splitting in the inas / inp spectra than in the inas / gaas spectra .",

    "the results are contrast to those of inas / gaas qds , whose properties are well understood , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the main difference between the optical properties of the two qds can be summarized as : ( i ) the alignment of emission lines of neutral exciton , charged exciton and biexciton in inas / inp qds is quite different from that in inas / gaas qds .",
