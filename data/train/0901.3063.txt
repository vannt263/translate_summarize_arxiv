    "in this paper we will deal with the problem of effectively putting on the test an hypothetical time - variation of the speed of light @xmath0 in a purely phenomenological , model - independent way with local , solar - system - scale astronomical observations .",
    "varying speed of light ( vsl ) theories were proposed in recent times to accommodate certain features of the hot big - bang cosmology . in this sense , the first modern vsl theory was put forth by moffat in ; for other pioneering works see , e.g. , and .",
    "since then , this subject was dealt with by many authors investigating different aspects of it ; see , e.g. , for an extensive review . broadly speaking , such theories can be subdivided in two categories : those encompassing space - time variations of @xmath0 , motivated by cosmology , and those where @xmath0 varies with the energy scale , related to phenomenological quantum gravity .",
    "subtle issues concerning fundamental aspects of vsl theories have been recently discussed in , and .    from the observational point of view , the measured percent change = ( -7.21.8)10 ^ -6 of the fine structure constant and other fundamental constants , see , e.g. , . ]",
    "= , where @xmath11 is the rationalized electron charge and @xmath12 is the planck s constant , respectively , from quasar observations at redshift @xmath13 was very important for vsl theories ; indeed , the natural question arises : if @xmath14 is varying , is such a change due to @xmath11 , @xmath15 or @xmath0 ? by attributing @xmath16 to a temporal variation of @xmath0 , it follows = - . according to the distinction of the many facets of @xmath0 proposed in",
    ", the @xmath0 present here would be @xmath8 , i.e. the electromagnetic constant . since < 0 , the value of @xmath14 was lower in the past ; thus , @xmath0 would have been larger in the past and it would be decreasing . by assuming a linear time dependence ( t - t_0)<0 , from it can be obtained ( -82)10 ^ -16  yr^-1 for t - t_09  gyrwhich approximately corresponds to the temporal interval spanned by the data analyzed in , i.e. from 23@xmath17 to 87@xmath17 of the age of the universe . a tighter bound could be obtained from the constrain in the variation of @xmath14 over the last 1.8 gyr ||310 ^ -17  yr^-1from an analysis of the oklo mine data .    can local and @xmath18 see . ]",
    "( in space and time ) astronomical observations tell us something about the hypothesis that @xmath0 undergoes temporal variations ? the answer is , in principle , positive because the motion of the major bodies of the solar system is governed by the dynamical equations of motion of classical general relativity in which @xmath0 , playing the role of the space - time structure constant @xmath1 , is explicitly present ; as we will see , a ( slowly ) time - varying @xmath0 induces dynamical effects that can be tested with the latest planetary observations independently of @xmath14 . of course",
    ", it must be borne in mind that such tests can only constrain @xmath19 over timescales of about one century , corresponding to the temporal interval covered by the modern astronomical observations of the major bodies of the solar system which are used to construct the present - day highly accurate ephemerides .",
    "we will follow a phenomenological approximation , without working in any specific vsl theoretical framework . by inserting into the 1pn gravitoelectric acceleration of order @xmath20 a_1pn = , which causes the well - known mercury s perihelion precession of 43.98 arcsec cy@xmath5",
    ", one gets a_1pn a_1pn ; here and in the following @xmath21 .",
    "note that , according to the distinction of the many facets of @xmath0 proposed in , the quantity varying here is the space - time structure constant @xmath1 , which is , in principle , not related to the electromagnetic constant @xmath8 . it can be shown that the first term of is proportional to @xmath22 , while the other two terms are proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 the einstein space - time matter constant",
    "; however , in order to get the correct newtonian limit for gravity , we will assume @xmath25 .",
    "our approach , which has the merit of making direct and unambiguous contact with the observations giving definite answers , might be criticized from a theoretical point of view as , perhaps , too nave ; indeed , as pointed out by jordan , in general , it is not consistent to allow a constant to vary in an equation that has been derived from a variational principle under the hypothesis that this quantity is constant ; one needs to go back to the lagrangian and derive new equations with the constant treated as a dynamical field .",
    "however , whatever the temporal evolution of @xmath26 may be , the approximation of is adequate for the practical purpose of testing it over relatively short timescales like the last century in which modern astronomical planetary observations were collected",
    ". incidentally , let us note that , in this case , certain observational issues can be neglected , at least from a practical point of view .",
    "indeed , from d = dt , where @xmath0 is the space - time structure constant @xmath1 , by assuming a linear time variation of it , the following shift in the measured proper time would occur for a static field||=;over @xmath27 yr and by assuming for @xmath1 the same rate of change of @xmath8 obtained from the oklo natural reactor data for @xmath14 of , it turns out ||1.510 ^ -15,which is basically undetectable given the present - day accuracy in realizing the si second by the bureau international des poids et mesures ( bipm ) , i.e. @xmath28 .    from a dynamical point of view",
    ", @xmath29 can certainly be considered as a small perturbation with respect to the newtonian monopole over timescales of about 100 yr , as it will be a posteriori confirmed by the bound on @xmath30 that we will obtain with such a hypothesis ; the same holds if one uses derived from @xmath16 .",
    "thus , can be treated perturbatively with the standard gauss approach which is valid for any perturbing acceleration , whatever its physical origin may be . in order to evaluate the orbital effects of a generic small disturbing acceleration @xmath31 ,",
