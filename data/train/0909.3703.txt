    "the type iip supernova 1987a is the most well - observed and published supernova in existence . as the brightest supernova seen since the invention of the telescope ,",
    "it has been observed right across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio through to gamma rays .",
    "it was also the first supernova for which we have observations of the progenitor , as well as the first and only supernova thus far to have been associated with a neutrino burst event @xcite .",
    "neutrino observations from sn1987a have been used to put a firm foundation on theories of core collapse and neutron star formation @xcite as well as giving a time of core collapse at 1987 february 23 , 07:35 ut . shortly after core collapse an expanding shockwave tore through the progenitor s stellar envelope .",
    "the resulting shock breakout resulted in a uv flash that ionized material in the circumstellar environment @xcite , illuminating a central equatorial ring and two outer rings that we now know are part of a much larger hourglass structure @xcite . as yet , the mechanism for ring formation is not properly understood , however two competing theories , the interacting winds model @xcite and the binary merger model @xcite offer plausible mechanisms for shaping the rings . at present",
    "the shock is transiting the equatorial ring and continues to provide insights into the hydrodynamics of a unique young supernova remnant as followed by x - ray , optical and radio telescopes .    in",
    "the radio sn1987a was imaged as soon as a few days after detection . on 1987",
    "feb 25 , @xcite detected emission at 843  mhz with the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) along with detections at 1.4 , 2.3 and 8.4  ghz by an interferometer formed between the parkes 64  m and tidbinbilla 34  m antennas .",
    "emission at 843  mhz peaked around 130  mjy on 1987 feb 26 - 27 .",
    "just over five days after the neutrino burst ( 1987 feb 28 ) , @xcite used vlbi techniques to resolve the expanding radiosphere .",
    "continued observations saw the supernova fade from its intial radio burst to almost undetectable levels within a few months @xcite . from this point on ,",
    "radio emission from sn1987a deviated radically from the trend of typical type iip supernova light curves .",
    "radio emission from the remnant returned in 1990 with a re - detection at 843  mhz by most on july 5 @xcite and the six 22 m antennas of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) a month later @xcite",
    ". this has been interpreted as a collision between the expanding shock front and an ionized hydrogen region about half the distance to the optical ring @xcite . since then , an ongoing observing campaign @xcite has followed radio emission from the developing remnant at frequencies ranging from 1.4 to 20 ghz .",
    "this saw the radio emission rise at monotonically increasing rate as the shockwave began its crossing of the ring @xcite .",
    "such behaviour puts the remnant of sn1987a in the somewhat rare category of young and brightening supernova remnants , along with the galactic supernova remnant g1@xmath49 + 0.3 @xcite .",
    "high precision images of the remnant at high resolution are important for studying the morphology and evolution of the blastwave interaction .",
    "previous estimates of the optical ring geometry @xcite have shown that it is an ellipse with semi - major axis @xmath5 and semi - minor axis @xmath6 , thus requiring very high resolution imaging .",
    "cameras aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) are capable of imaging at @xmath7 pixel@xmath8 @xcite which has enabled detailed imaging of the structure of the equatorial ring as well as the development of the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "pixels on the acis detector aboard the chandra x - ray observatory register half the total encircled energy of incident photons within a circle of diameter 08 [ half power beam diameter ( hpd ) ] , although this can be improved to around @xmath9 hpd with subsampling techniques @xcite . in 2007 october , @xcite used an e - vlbi array formed between the atca , parkes , and mopra ( 22 m ) antennas to image the remnant of sn1987a at 1.4  ghz with a restoring beam of 85x168 milli - arcseconds .",
    "however the limited range of baselines made such an array insensitive to details larger than @xmath10 . in the radio",
    "the atca is capable of resolving details as small as 02 at around 40 ghz , which nicely fills in the gap left by the vlbi observation and images at the lower frequencies .",
    "imaging at higher frequencies around 100  ghz is also possible , although this capability is enable to for only five of the six antennas , cutting the number of baselines by a third as well as reducing the maximum baseline length to 3  km .",
    "this translates to roughly the same resolution ( approximately @xmath11 ) as the 40  ghz band .",
    "unfortunately at higher frequencies atmospheric opacity degrades the image with approximately an order of magnitude higher effective system temperature @xcite . with an aim to obtain the highest resolution images currently possible with the atca , the ongoing imaging observations of @xcite were extended to include frequencies around 36  ghz . in this paper",
    "we present the latest 36  ghz data from the recent extension to these ongoing observations .",
    "our observations of the supernova remnant were made with the atca at center frequencies of 34.88 and 37.44 ghz on 2008 april 25 and 2008 october 7,8,12 using antenna configuration 6a with multifrequency imaging over @xmath12 mhz bandwidth in all stokes parameters .",
    "atmospheric phase stability at the atca was monitored with two 1.8 m antennas spaced 230 m apart designed to measure the path noise of a 30  ghz signal from the geostationary optus - b3 communications satellite . a path noise of below 300 @xmath13 m is considered good for millimetre - wave astronomy at the atca .",

    "the secondary flux calibrator pks 0637 - 752 was observed for 2 minutes in hourly intervals and the phase calibrator pks 0530 - 727 was observed for 1.5 minutes per 6 minutes integration time on source .",
    "a flux density of @xmath22 and @xmath23 jy at 34.88 and 37.44 ghz was obtained for the 2008 october observations of pks 0637 - 752 by bootstrapping an observation of the primary flux calibrator uranus at similar elevation ( @xmath24 ) from the night of 2008 october 8 .",
    "the flux density of pks 0637 - 752 for the 2008 april 25 observation was similarly determined to be @xmath25 and @xmath26 jy using a later 2008 may 25 observation of both the calibrator and uranus ( at the shortest baseline ) .",

    "were affected by prevailing weather conditions , making the 2008 april 25 flux density estimate unreliable .",

    "the 8.6 and 36.2 ghz fitted shell widths do not agree at the @xmath44 level . if this is a physical effect , it may be due to a positional dependency of the distribution of particle energies in the forward shock .",
    "the small shell width characteristic of the fits to low frequency radio emission may correspond to a proportionately larger population of newly swept up particles at the forward shock .",

    "we know from neutrino observations that a large number of neutrons were formed in the core collapse .",
    "however it is still uncertain if a neutron star survived the explosion .",
    "searches for an associated pulsar have been unsuccessful so far @xcite , although they only rule out the existence of a relatively high - luminosity pulsar .",
    "another possible way to find evidence of a surviving neutron star is to look for a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , are clouds of non - thermally radiating particles that are excited by an enclosed compact central source .",
    "pwne have been detected in about ten percent of all known core collapse supernova remnants @xcite , with the crab nebula and 3c58 being some of the the best - known examples . in the radio",
    "such nebulae are characterised by polarised synchrotron emission and typically have a flat spectral index of ranging between -0.3 and 0 @xcite .",
    "detection of flat spectral index emission near the explosion site of sn1987a , as was the case with sn1986j @xcite , would be a good indication that a neutron star has survived the explosion .",
    "a search for a possible central flat spectrum source was undertaken by generating a spectral index image using the 2008 oct data at 36.2  ghz and the 2008 october data at 8.6  ghz [ discussed in section [ obsreduc ] ] . as the synthesised beam for the 8.6  ghz data is 04 , the 36.2  ghz data were re - imaged with a 04 restoring beam using the maxen algorithm instead of clean for consistency with the 8.6  ghz image .",
    "both the 8.6  ghz and the re - imaged 36.2  ghz images are shown in the middle row of figure [ models_and_maps ] . as a precaution against possible false spectral index information generated by the imaging process , we also produced a comparison spectral index image made from the fourier models in the top row of figure [ models_and_maps ] .",
    "the models were inserted into the visibility data with a suitable position offset to locate it at the same angular distance from the phase center but on the opposite side of the phase center from the remnant . following imaging and deconvolution , the resulting model images , shown in the bottom row of figure [ models_and_maps ] , have approximately the same noise , flux density , and restoring beam characteristics as their real counterparts . in figure [ spectralindexmaps ]",
    "we present the two spectral index images .",
    "figure [ spectralindexmaps](a ) was formed by comparing the 2008 oct 8.6  ghz and re - imaged 2008 oct 36.2  ghz observations , and figure [ spectralindexmaps](b ) was formed by comparing the 2008 oct 8.6  ghz and 2008 oct 36.2  ghz model images . the real spectral index image has been masked using the same mask used to determine the flux of the 2008 october clean image at 36.2  ghz . a similar mask has also been applied to the model spectral index image .",

    "there are two notable flat spectral index features in the real image .",
    "the feature at the northern rim is caused by the spurious north - south extensions mentioned in section [ obsreduc ] .",
    "the feature around 02 east of the progenitor position , which has a maximum spectral index of @xmath64 and encompasses an area of approximately one beam ( width @xmath65 ) .",
    "the position of the flattest spectral index in this feature is @xmath66 ( j2000 ) with around 50 mas positional uncertainty .",
    "however a smaller flat spectral index feature is also present in the model counterpart .",
    "this feature is largely due to the imaging process rather than noise or differences between the models .",
    "follow - up observations will be needed to determine if the feature in the real spectral index images corresponds to an actual source of emission in the central region emission not fitted by our fourier models .",
    "magnetic field direction in supernova remnants can be divided into three categories : tangled , radial and tangential . in the atlas of supernova remnants compiled by @xcite and @xcite , 27 out of the 70 remnants surveyed showed polarisation .",
    "the absence of polarisation in the presence of synchrotron emission indicates a tangled magnetic field and/or extreme rotation measures along the line of sight . of those remnants which did exhibit polarisation , such as cassiopeia a and tycho s remnant ,",
    "most under 10,000 years old had radial magnetic field directions across the shock front .",
    "rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instabilities have been implicated as the mechanism for the radial stretching of the magnetic field in young supernova remnants , however magnetohydrodynamical simulations have yet to produce r - t instabilities that reach across the forward shock @xcite .",
    "it is anticipated that higher shock compression ratios generated by the influence of shock - accelerated particles will enable the generation of radial magnetic fields that cross the shock @xcite .",
    "older supernova remnants such as vela exhibit a tangential magnetic field , interpreted as the accumulation of an interstellar magnetic field at the ageing blast front .",
    "a search was made for linear and circularly polarised emission in the remnant of sn1987a by constructing polarisation intensity images with natural weighting .",
    "no persistent linear polarisation in stokes - q was detected above a 3@xmath39 threshold of 0.6 and 0.24  mjy  beam@xmath8 for the 2008 april and 2008 october observations .",
    "a similar technique was employed to search for circular polarisation in stokes - v , however the same null result was obtained for a @xmath44 threshold of 0.6 and 0.24  mjy  beam@xmath8 .",
    "possible causes for the de - polarisation of the radio emission include a tangled magnetic field in the emitting region and/or extreme faraday rotation measures on the order of @xmath67 rad m@xmath68 .",
    "the optical position of the supernova at day 1278 , as measured by a frame - tie to the hipparcos and vlbi reference frames is @xmath69 ( j2000 ) , with an error of 30 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) in each coordinate @xcite . at day 7899 , corresponding to 2008 oct 9 , this position will have moved due to the proper motion of the remnant .",
    "the proper motion of the lmc according to @xcite is @xmath70 mas yr@xmath8 east and @xmath71 mas yr@xmath8 north .",
    "the remnant also experiences a @xmath72 mas yr@xmath8 motion north due to its estimated @xmath73  km s@xmath8 bulk rotation speed around the lmc @xcite at a distance of approximately 5 kpc from the lmc s kinematic center ( assuming a distance of 50kpc to sn1987a ) .",
    "if corrected for both effects , then the progenitor should , at day 7899 , be situated @xmath74 mas east and @xmath75 mas north of reynold s position , assuming an lmc distance of 50 kpc .",
    "this predicted position corresponds to the coordinates of @xmath76 ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of 30 mas in each coordinate .",
    "we tested this prediction by fitting an ellipse to points that make up a ridgeline of the radio ring in the combined 2008 april - oct 36.2  ghz image .",
    "points along the ridgeline in the radio image were located by propagating rays away from the original progenitor position .",
    "the point of maximum flux density along each propagated ray was determined to be part of the ridgeline .",
    "we fitted an ellipse to both flux - weighted and non flux - weighted ridge line points and tabulated the fitted ellipsoids in table [ ellipsefit ] .",
    "we see that fitting an ellipse to the 36.2  ghz october data in the image plane produces a semi - major axis that is slightly smaller but consistent with the mean radius obtained by fitting a truncated - shell model to visibility data in the uv plane .",

    "the flux - weighted ellipse centroid was located at @xmath83 ( j2000 ) and the un - weighted centroid was located at @xmath84 ( j2000 ) . because we have used the vlbi position of the phase calibrator 0530 - 727 from @xcite ,",
    "the estimated positional uncertainty of the fitted centroids above is about 30 mas in each coordinate with an additional @xmath85 mas uncertainty in the fit .",

    "the position of the possible flat spectral index feature in figure [ spectralindexmaps](a ) was offset 124 mas east and 32 mas south of the predicted position , which places it within 60 mas of the fitted centroids .",
    "radial profiles of the remnant were made by propagating rays away from the averaged position of the ellipse centroid [ obtained from the ridge - finding algorithm ] and plotting the resulting profiles , shown in figure [ radial_lines ] . in particular , note that the flux density within the projected radio ring on the image plane is always greater than @xmath34 above the rms noise of 0.06  mjy  beam@xmath8 , which indicates that emission is being produced along the line of sight , either from high latitude regions of the expanding shell , or from within the central region of the nebula itself .          in order to see how the 2008 oct 8.6  ghz and 2008 oct 36.2  ghz images compared with observations at other wavelengths we obtained optical hubble space telescope ( hst ) and x - ray chandra images from their respective public archives .",

    "the chandra x - ray image was a 0.5 - 8.0 kev acis image from an observation taken on 2008 july 9 - 11 .",
    "the x - ray image was reprocessed following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we removed the pixel randomization and applied the ` subpixel resolution ' technique @xcite to further improve the effective spatial resolution of the image .",
    "it was then deconvolved with the lucy - richardson algorithm @xcite using a monochromatic psf of 1.5 kev ( 2.5 kev for the hard band ) generated by the chandra ray tracer and marx .",
    "the results were smoothed by a gaussian of 01 fwhm . shown in figure [ four_way_comparison ]",
    "is a comparison between the hst , 36.2  ghz atca , 8.6  ghz atca , and chandra x - ray images .",
    "the coordinates of the hst and chandra images have been shifted such that the optical and x - ray rings are centered on the 2008 oct 36.2  ghz radio ring with an uncertainty of roughly 50 mas in each coordinate ; it also implies the central optical nebulosity aligns with the flat spectrum radio component .",
    "however this step precludes us from making further judgements about an asymmetry in the radio expansion with respect to the optical ring .",
    "one thing that is interesting about this plot , however , is that the radio images are more circular than the optical and x - ray .",
    "if we apply the ridge - following algorithm to the flux - unweighted optical ring in the hst image , the width of the fitted ellipse semi - major axis is @xmath91 and the semi - minor axis is @xmath92 with about 40 mas uncertainty in each axis . compared to the radio ring of size @xmath93 with similar uncertainty , the optical ring is slightly more elliptical . the difference in ellipticity",
    "can be explained by the difference in location at which the different types of emission are generated .",
    "non thermal radio emission is produced as the result of stochastic acceleration of particles at a shock front , and is primarily dependent on density for particle injection into the shock .",
    "thermal x - rays are produced by material heated by the shock and is dependent on both density and temperature of the heated material .",
    "hence we would expect radio emission to trace shock fronts to higher latitudes above the equatorial plane and x - ray and optical images to trace the higher density of heated material in the equatorial ring .",
    "@xmath94{hubble.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=6.5 cm , angle=270]{radio36.eps } \\\\ \\includegraphics[width=6.5 cm , angle=270]{radio8.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=6.5 cm , angle=270]{xray.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    in figure [ rgb_overlay ] the hst and chandra images have been overlaid with the radio contours from the 36.2  ghz radio image . from the peaks in the radio",
    "contours it is evident that the forward shock is only slightly larger than the 08 optical ring .",
    "the truncated - shell models fitted to the 2008 october data give a more accurate shell radius of @xmath95 for the 36  ghz data which is larger but still consistent .",
    "however the radius measured at 8.6  ghz is @xmath96 , which suggests that the forward shock has almost completed its transit of the optical ring .",
    "in this paper we have presented results from the 36.2  ghz extension of the monitoring observations of sn1987a performed in april and october 2008 .",
    "the october observation was conducted under conditions of good atmospheric stability .",
    "a flux density of @xmath33  mjy was obtained which allows us to derive a spectral index of @xmath97 when fitted along with flux densities from the lower frequency monitoring observations .",
    "the fourier modeling technique of @xcite was employed to produce a model fit of the torus that is consistent with the 8.6  ghz image .",
    "a comparison of the 36.2  ghz image with the 8.6  ghz image at similar resolution was used to obtain a spectral index image that showed a region of flatter spectral index about 02 east of the progenitor .",
    "simulations suggest a component of this may be an artifact of the imaging process .",
    "however follow - up observations are suggested to determine if the remaining component is real central region emission not fitted by our fourier models . higher sensitivity observations with the newly - commissioned compact array broadband backend ( cabb )",
    "will help further clarify this feature .",
    "an elliptical fit to the 36.2  ghz radio morphology shows that the centroid of the remnant is within positional accuracy of the progenitor s location when corrected for the proper motion of the lmc and the motion of sn1987a within the lmc .",
    "the fit is also located within positional uncertainty of the flat spectral index feature .",
    "comparisons between radio and x - ray images show that the remnant is more spherical in the radio , which can be explained by two different emission mechanisms at work . from the fourier models and comparisons to the optical emission we conclude that the forward shock in the remnant is completing its transit of the optical ring .",
    "we would like to thank bjorn emonts and robin wark their assistance with our observations , andre fletcher for useful discussions on radio reduction , brian reville and john kirk for their insightful comments on particle acceleration at shock fronts .",
