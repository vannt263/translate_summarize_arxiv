    "blazars with only weak or entirely absent emission lines in the optical band are classified as bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) .",
    "their spectral energy distributions ( seds : in @xmath8 ) are characterized by a two - bump structure  @xcite . since the discovery of the first extra - galactic tev - photon emitter , mkn421  @xcite , very - high - energy ( vhe :",

    "these objects belong to the sub - class known as `` high - frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) ''  @xcite .",
    "their non - thermal emission in this lower energy bump is commonly ascribed to synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons , accelerated in the jet moving with relativistic bulk speed  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the two - bump structure in seds of hbls has been well explained by synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models , where the target photons of inverse - compton scattering for the higher energy bump are the synchrotron photons produced by the same electron population  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this model the high energy end of the electron spectrum is responsible for both x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray emission .",

    "the target photons could also be produced in the accretion disk  @xcite or in the broad - line region  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
