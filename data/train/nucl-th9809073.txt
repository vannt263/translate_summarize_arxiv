    "in the vicinity of the equilibrium state of the nuclear fermi - liquid drop the stiffness coefficients are positive and the system is stable with respect to particle density and surface distortions . with decreasing bulk density or increasing internal excitation energy ( temperature )",
    "the liquid drop reaches the regions of mechanical or thermodynamical instabilities with respect to small particle density and shape fluctuations and to separation into liquid and gas phases .",
    "the process of the development of instability is a complicated one .",
    "we will discuss some aspects of the process .",
    "in particular , we will study the influence of a sharp liquid - drop boundary on the instability with respect to small particle density fluctuations .",
    "in actual nuclear processes ( heavy - ion reactions , nuclear fission etc . ) nuclear matter is not static , and consequently the development of instability depends not only on the equation of state , but also on the dynamical effects such as the dynamical fermi - surface distortion or the relaxation processes",
    ". we will take into account these aspects in studying the stability of the fermi - liquid drop in both regimes of the first- and zero sound modes .",

    "( [ 0disp1 ] ) , @xmath74 thus , the critical wave number @xmath72 does not depend on the viscosity .",

    "we show also the result for the nonviscous infinite nuclear matter and the nonviscous finite liquid drop neglecting fermi surface distortion effects . in a finite system ,",
    "the non - monotony behaviour of the instability growth rate as a function of the wave number @xmath42 is due to the anomalous dispersion term in eq .",
    "( [ disp1 ] ) created by the gradient terms in the equation of state .",
    "we point out that the finite system becomes more stable with respect to short - wave - length density fluctuations at @xmath85 .",
    "we can also see that the presence of viscosity decreases the instability .",
    "the strong decrease of instability in a fermi liquid drop ( fld ) , when compared with the corresponding result for the usual liquid drop ( ld ) , is because of the fermi surface distortion effects . in fig .",
    "2 , this peculiarity of the fld can be seen in a transparent way for both the infinite nuclear matter and the finite fermi liquid drop .    for a saturated nuclear liquid one",
    "has for the force parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the critical value @xmath72 , eq . ( [ crit ] ) , increases with decreasing bulk density @xmath18 at @xmath88 , see also eq .",
    "( [ fl ] ) .",
    "the existence of the critical wave number @xmath72 for an unstable mode is a feature of the finite system .",
    "the growth rate @xmath60 depends on the multipolarity @xmath40 of the nuclear density distortion and on the position of the eigenvalue , @xmath89 , in the interval of @xmath90 @xcite . for a given @xmath19 ,",
    "the value of @xmath89 increases with @xmath40 for @xmath91 because of the boundary condition ( [ sec1 ] ) , see table 1 .",
    "that means that if @xmath92 the instability increases with @xmath40 and the nucleus becomes more unstable with respect to an internal clusterization to small pieces ( high multipolarity regime ) rather than to binary fission ( low multipolarity regime ) .",
    "in contrast , the binary fission is preferable if @xmath93 .",
    "we give in table 1 the values @xmath94 for two nuclei , @xmath1 and @xmath0 as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ sec1 ] ) .",
    "the calculations were performed with the surface tension parameter @xmath95mev .",
    "we point out that the value of @xmath70 is given here by @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the instability growth rate at @xmath97mev and @xmath80mev as function of the multipolarity @xmath40 of the particle density fluctuations for two nuclei @xmath1 and @xmath0 . as is seen from fig .",
    "3 , the lowest values of @xmath98 give the contribution to the instability growth rate @xmath60 for the nucleus @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the nucleus @xmath0 is unstable with respect to the fission under the conditions considered above .",
    "in contrast , the instability growth rate of the nucleus @xmath1 includes the higher multipolarity @xmath99 and this nucleus has to be unstable with respect to multifragmentation .",
    "starting from the fluid dynamic equation of motion for the fermi liquid drop with a sharp surface , we have derived the dispersion relations ( [ disp1 ] ) and ( [ 0disp ] ) for both the stable and the unstable regime . the dispersion relations are influenced strongly by the fermi - surface distortion effect and the anomalous dispersion caused by the finiteness of the system .",
    "the presence of the fermi surface distortion enhances the stiffness coefficient for a stable mode and reduces the instability growth rate for an unstable one .",
    "we have shown that the instability growth rate in an unstable finite system is a non - monotony function of the wave number @xmath42 because of the anomalous dispersion term .",
    "this is in contrast with the infinite nuclear matter case where the instability growth rate increases with @xmath42 .",
    "the non - monotony behaviour of the instability growth rate @xmath100 in a finite fermi liquid drop is accompanied with two characteristic wave numbers @xmath70 and @xmath72 , see eqs .",
    "( [ def1 ] ) and ( [ crit ] ) .",
    "the distortion of the fermi - surface leads to a decrease of the critical value @xmath72 .",
    "the decay mode of an unstable fermi liquid drop depends on the location of the eigen wave number @xmath42 on the slope of the curve @xmath100 .",
    "the fermi liquid drop is more unstable with respect to multifragmentation if @xmath101 and the binary fission is preferable if @xmath85 .",
    "this is because the eigen wave number @xmath89 , derived from the secular equation ( [ sec1 ] ) , increases with the multipolarity @xmath40 of the particle density fluctuations .",
    "as an example , we have demonstrated this phenomenon in the case of hot nuclei @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0 is more unstable with respect to the short wave fluctuations and prefers to decay into the binary fission channel .",
    "the multifragmentation channel is preferable at the development of the instability in the heavy nucleus @xmath1 .",
