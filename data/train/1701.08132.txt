    "in this article we are interested in what we will call _ universal mapping class groups _ of genus @xmath0 ; these are groups that contain the mapping class group of every compact orientable surface of genus @xmath3 with non - empty boundary .",
    "universal mapping class groups appear naturally in various contexts . as a first example",
    ", one can consider a set @xmath10 of compact surfaces with boundary , equipped with the partial order given by surface inclusion , and take the direct limit of the corresponding mapping class groups . by construction , this direct limit is an infinitely - generated group which contains the mapping class group @xmath11 for every @xmath12 .",
    "this is the approach taken by harer @xcite , and subsequently by many others , in order to study the so - called _ stable homology _ of the mapping class group ; compare with the discussion around theorem [ thm : homology ] below .",
    "a more general approach is to consider the mapping class group of an appropriate _ infinite - type _ surface , i.e. with infinitely - generated fundamental group . in this direction , consider the surface @xmath2 that results from removing a cantor set from a closed orientable surface of genus @xmath13 .",
    "then its mapping class group @xmath9 , i.e. the group of isotopy classes of self - homeomorphisms of @xmath2 , contains the mapping class group of every compact surface of genus @xmath3 with non - empty boundary .",
    "the groups @xmath9 were recently ( re-)brought into the picture by calegari @xcite , who remarked that every group that acts freely by homeomorphisms on a closed surface of genus @xmath3 admits a natural homomorphism to @xmath9 .",
    "observe , however , that @xmath9 is certainly enormous : for instance , it surjects onto the homeomorphism group of a cantor set ( see e.g. below ) , which is itself uncoutable . before continuing we",
    "remark that , quite surprisingly , if one were to define @xmath9 in terms of isotopy classes of _ ambient diffeomorphisms _ instead , then the resulting group turns out to be discrete , as proved recently in @xcite .",
    "in any of the approaches described above , we see that the resulting universal mapping class group is ( at least ) infinitely - generated , and thus not that attractive from the point of view of geometric group theory .",
    "this obstacle was first overcome by @xcite in the case of genus zero .",
    "more concretely , in that paper it is proved that the subgroup @xmath14 of _ asymptotically rigid _",
    "mapping classes is finitely presented , and still contains the mapping class group of every compact surface of genus zero .",
    "roughly speaking , the elements of @xmath15 are mappping classes that preserve some kind of _ rigid structure at infinity _ , see section [ sec : defs ] for a formal definition .",
    "subsequently in @xcite , the same authors studied a similar asymptotically rigid mapping class group @xmath16 , this time for a surface @xmath17 of infinite genus with a cantor space of ends .",

    "write @xmath469 for the group of isotopy classes of asymptotically quasi - rigid homeomorphisms of @xmath100 , which recall is the surface obtained from @xmath92 by removing @xmath195 isolated points . by using a minor adaptation of the argument in proposition [ prop : extfk2 ]",
    ", we get :      as was the case in the proof of proposition [ prop : extfk2 ] , the reduced pants complex of @xmath100 is a connected and simply - connected 2-complex on which @xmath471 acts cocompactly .",
    "moreover , the stabilizer in @xmath471 of every cell is a finite extension of the corresponding stabilizer in @xmath139 ; in particular , it is finitely presented . at this point ,",

    "next , all dehn twists are conjugate in @xmath15 .",
    "then the normal subgroup in @xmath471 generated by one dehn twist coincides with the group generated by all dehn twists , namely with @xmath90 .",
    "hence , adding to a finite presentation of @xmath471 one more relator corresponding to a dehn twist yields a presentation of @xmath460 , which is therefore finitely presented .    to see that @xmath460 is simplie , first recall that a sufficiently transitive permutation group generated by elements of small support has simple commutator ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the group @xmath460 inherits the sufficient transitivity from the @xmath62-action on the cantor set ( see e.g. @xcite , section 3 ) . on the other hand @xmath460",
    "is generated by the images of half - twists and @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that @xmath460 is generated by elements of arbitrarily small support .",
    "observe that all half twists are conjugate in @xmath59 and hence in @xmath460 , so that @xmath472 has order at most 2 .",
    "now , the class of ( the image of ) a half - twist in @xmath460 is the restriction of an affine orientation - reversing self - homeomorphism of an interval .",
    "it follows that a half twist of an interval is the composition of the permutation exchanging its two halves and the product of the half twists of each halve .",
    "this relation implies that @xmath460 is perfect and hence simple .",
    "the group @xmath8 acts on the cut - system complex @xmath196 , which is connected and simply - connected by theorem [ thm : ht ] .",
    "since @xmath4 acts cocompactly on @xmath196 and @xmath467 , it follows that the action of @xmath8 on @xmath196 is also cocompact .",

    "edge ) of @xmath196 is , up to finite index , the group @xmath473 ( resp @xmath474 ) , which is finitely presented by proposition [ prop : half - finpres ] . at this point",

    "let @xmath30 and fix , once and for all , a rigid structure on @xmath2 .",
    "recall from section [ sec : rigid ] that the rigid structure is given by a separating curve on @xmath2 , which will be denoted @xmath477 for reasons that will become apparent below , plus a rigid structure on the planar component @xmath478 of @xmath479 .",
    "let @xmath94 be the pants decomposition underlying the rigid structure on @xmath478 .",
    "there is an obvious rooted tree @xmath144 associated to @xmath94 , whose vertices are the curves of @xmath94 , with the root being @xmath477 . as such , every vertex of @xmath144 is naturally labelled by a word @xmath480 in the free semigroup @xmath481 generated by the two letters @xmath482 ( left ) and @xmath483 ( right ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath484 the curve of @xmath94 labelled by the word @xmath485 , and write @xmath486 for the half - twist about @xmath484 .    in turn",
    ", this labelling induces a labelling of the set of pairs of pants of @xmath478 by words in @xmath481 .",
    "indeed , we set @xmath487 to be the unique @xmath94-suited pair of pants of @xmath478 that has @xmath484 as boundary component and is contained in the planar component of @xmath488 .",

    "observe that the choice is far from unique ; however , for any such choice , the set @xmath494 is _ proper _ , in the sense that every compact subsurface of @xmath2 intersects only finitely many elements of this set . because of this",
