    "we study classical ( i.e. non - quantum ) systems of particles interacting pairwisely by the coulomb potential , which are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "such systems are of practical interest in the `` real '' three - dimensional ( 3d ) world where the coulomb potential has the standard @xmath1 form .",
    "one can extend its definition to any dimension @xmath2 in the following way : the coulomb potential @xmath3 at a spatial position @xmath4 , induced by a unit charge at the origin @xmath5 , is the solution of the poisson equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 [ @xmath8 denotes the gamma function ] is the surface area of the @xmath9-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "in particular , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and an arbitrary length scale @xmath12 fixes the zero of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) coulomb potential .",
    "such definition implies in the fourier space the characteristic @xmath13 behaviour which maintains many generic properties of 3d coulomb systems like screening @xcite .",
    "this is why many important phenomena related to the coulomb law manifest themselves in a similar way in various spatial dimensions .",
    "2d one - component ( jellium ) and symmetric two - component ( coulomb gas ) systems with logarithmic charge interactions are of special importance because they are exactly solvable , besides the mean - field weak - coupling limit , also at a specific finite temperature .",
    "the solvable cases involve the bulk regime @xcite as well as inhomogeneous , semi - infinite or fully finite geometries @xcite , see reviews @xcite .",
    "this permits us to check basic concepts or ideas on 2d exact solutions .",
    "one of extensively studied problems in our days is the electromagnetic casimir effect , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite . in its formulation within classical statistical mechanics , two conducting neutral slabs in thermal equilibrium [ at the inverse temperature @xmath14 , being from one another at distance @xmath0 much larger than any microscopic ( e.g. debye - hckel ) length scale , are attracted by the long - range van der waals - casimir force .",
    "this force is due to thermal fluctuations of local charge densities inside globally neutral conductors . in @xmath9 spatial dimensions ,",
    "the force per unit area of one of the slabs , or equivalently the pressure @xmath15 , was obtained in the form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the riemann zeta function and the minus / plus sign means attraction / repulsion of the slabs .",
    "note that in one dimension , one gets a finite result owing to the limiting behaviour @xmath18 . in 2d , we have explicitly @xmath19 and in 3d @xmath20 these large - distance behaviours do not depend on the composition of conducting slabs , nor on the temperature : they are universal .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the microscopic origin of this universality lies in an electroneutrality sum rule for coulomb fluids .",
    "another basic problem in soft matter physics is the determination of the temperature - dependent effective interaction between charged mesoscopic objects , macro - ions ( colloids , polyelectrolytes ) or charged membranes of several thousands elementary charges @xmath21 , immersed in a polar solvent , e.g. water , containing mobile micro - ions of low valence .",
    "let the large macro - ions be approximated by rectilinear hard walls , filled by a material of the same dielectric constant as the solvent ( i.e. there are no electrostatic image charges ) . in a simplified model coined as `` counter - ions only '' , or `` salt - free '' ,",
    "the macro - ions acquire a fixed surface charge density @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) by releasing equally charged @xmath24 ( valence @xmath25 , for simplicity ) counter - ions into the solvent , the system as a whole being electroneutral .",
    "this model was studied in the semi - infinite geometry of one charged wall and for counter - ions being in between two _ symmetrically _ charged parallel plates at distance @xmath0 .",
    "it became the cornerstone for studying systematically the weak - coupling ( high - temperature ) @xcite and strong - coupling ( low - temperature ) @xcite limit of coulomb fluids .",
    "while two symmetrically charged plates always repel one another in the weak - coupling limit , the situation changes for sufficiently large couplings : an attraction may occur in a certain interval of distances @xmath0 .",
    "an important information in the two - plate geometry is the asymptotic @xmath26 behaviour of the pressure , namely its sign ( attraction or repulsion ) and the explicit inverse - power - law dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "naively , one may expect that for large @xmath0 , the counter - ions will separate onto two sets , one for each plate , to neutralize these plates .",
    "then each plate with its counter - ions might be viewed as a `` neutral slab '' and the two slabs interact consequently by the attractive van der waals - casimir force of type ( [ casimir ] ) .",
    "but the poisson - boltzmann solution @xcite , generalized straightforwardly from 3d to any dimension @xmath9 , @xmath27 shows that the possibility of counter - ions to migrate in the space between the plates is crucial .",
    "this force is repulsive and differs fundamentally from the attractive fluctuational one ( [ casimir ] ) : although the prefactor to @xmath28 is independent of the fixed surface charge density @xmath22 , it does depend on the temperature .",
    "an important question is whether the mean - field asymptotic behaviour ( [ pressureas ] ) remains valid also for finite temperatures .",
    "such supposition is often taken as natural , without any rigorous proof .",
    "for the related geometry of one wall , the density profiles of counter - ions were investigated within a test - charge theory for the electric double layer in ref .",
    "this theory provides results which interpolate between the correct strong - coupling ( exponential decay ) and the weak - coupling ( algebraic decay ) limits .",
    "its application to intermediate values of the coupling constant indicates that there is a crossover from exponential to algebraic decay at large distance from the charged wall .",
    "it is argued that in the algebraic regime , the density profile is described by a modified mean - field equation .",
    "this unexpected conclusion might be put into doubts by the fact that the exact contact theorem for the particle density at the wall is not fulfilled by the test - charge theory in the region of intermediate values of the coupling constant .    for symmetrically charged lines in 2d , the mean - field formula for the pressure ( [ pressureas ] ) takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the 2d coupling constant . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we solved exactly the free - fermion point @xmath31 by using a technique of anticommuting variables , with the result @xmath32 this asymptotic behaviour is not compatible with the mean - field one ( [ meanfield ] ) , i.e. the mean - field prefactor must be renormalized by a @xmath33-dependent function which goes to unity as @xmath34 .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .    * first ,",
    "for the `` unconstrained '' version of the model with counter - ions moving freely in space between the lines , we generalize the exact result at @xmath31 for symmetric lines @xcite to asymmetrically charged lines , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the weak - coupling and strong - coupling limits for 3d asymmetrically charged plates were investigated in ref .",
    "the 2d exact result at the finite free - fermion coupling @xmath31 , presented in this work , leads to a pressure which consists of two decoupled contributions from each of the lines . *",
    "our second aim is to solve a `` constrained '' version of the model in which counter - ions do not move freely between the asymmetrically charged lines , but are constrained to them ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the particle occupation of the lines is not fixed , i.e. the particles can lie either on @xmath35 line or @xmath36 line .",
    "a similar 3d model , in which charged particles are constrained to and simultaneously neutralize each of the symmetrically - charged plates , was introduced and studied at low temperatures in refs .",
    "we show that our constrained model yields a phenomenology that is close to the casimir electromagnetic effect , although , at each finite distance , the net charge of every line is non - zero and thus the charged lines together with the attached particles do not describe neutral conductors as required by the casimir effect .",
    "for both models , there are important differences between the cases of likely - charged and oppositely - charged lines , the latter case corresponds at large distances to a capacitor .    ) along the @xmath37-axis .",

    "this remark on the failure of mean - field at asymptotic distances , corroborates previous 2d results obtained for symmetric lines @xcite .",
    "it goes against common expectation that mean - field should hold at large @xmath0 @xcite , the underlying argument being that the small density of ions far from the plate may effectively drive the system into a weakly - coupled regime , in the corresponding distance range .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that coulomb potential @xmath205 is logarithmic in two dimensions and hence scale - free , so that the coulombic coupling does not depend on the density : it is always @xmath206 .",
    "hence , a 2d system , unlike its higher dimensional counterparts , is nowhere weakly coupled when @xmath207 , and it therefore does not come as a surprise that mean - field breaks down in 2d , even at large distances .",
    "conversely , in dimension @xmath208 , the standard argument on the asymptotic validity of mean - field may well apply .",
    "we note that it is backed up by recent accurate monte carlo results @xcite . as concerns the constrained model ,",
    "the net charge density on each of the two lines is nonzero for every finite distance @xmath0 and vanishes only at @xmath26 .",
    "the universal @xmath26 behavior of the pressure ( [ univpres ] ) coincides with that of the van der waals - casimir for two neutral 2d conductors ( [ casimir2d ] ) , without any need for temperature renormalization .    for oppositely charged lines , the pressure at asymptotically large @xmath0 corresponds to a capacitor in both unconstrained ( [ capacitor1 ] ) and constrained ( [ capacitor2 ] ) cases .",
    "this fact has an important impact especially on the unconstrained model which exhibits at a special dimensionless distance @xmath140 a transition from the repulsion regime for @xmath170 to the attraction regime for @xmath171 ; for the dependence of @xmath140 on the negative asymmetry @xmath209 see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .    finally , investigating the two present models under stronger correlations ( e.g. @xmath210 , or 6 ) and also ultimately in the strongly coupled limit ( @xmath211 ) , provides interesting venues for future work .",
