    "+ finally we numerically illustrate the density @xmath5 and its asymptotic behaviour at @xmath7 for some particular subordinators @xmath74 .",
    "let us first shortly discuss the method we used .",
    "clearly the equation ( [ cpy_main ] ) motivates the following straightforward discretisation procedure : approximate @xmath5 by a step function @xmath342 , i.e.    @xmath343 where @xmath344 forms a grid on the @xmath279-axis .",
    "the heights @xmath345 can then be found by iterating over @xmath346 , thereby at each step using ( [ cpy_main ] ) with @xmath347 and @xmath5 replaced by @xmath342 .",
    "two remarks are in place here .",
    "firstly , as ( [ cpy_main ] ) is linear in @xmath5 the condition that @xmath5 is a density is required to uniquely determine the solution .",
    "this translates to the fact that the numerical procedure discussed above requires a starting point , i.e. the value @xmath348 should be known .",
    "( of course , starting with @xmath349 yields @xmath350 . ) we proceed by first leaving @xmath351 undetermined , run the iteration so that every @xmath345 in fact becomes a linear function of @xmath351 , and then find @xmath351 by requiring that @xmath342 integrates to @xmath55 .",
    "the second remark is that even though any choice of grid would in principle work , we found one in particular to be useful . indeed ,",
    "if we set @xmath352 for some @xmath353 less than ( but typically very close to ) @xmath55 , equation ( [ prop1 ] ) yields the following relation : @xmath354 the approximation this setup yields is very efficient in comparison with e.g. the approximation using a standard equidistant grid , due to the fact that in this case we need to evaluate only @xmath355 different integrals numerically .",
    "first we consider two examples for which the density @xmath5 of @xmath35 is explicitly known .",
    "the first one is taken from example 2 with @xmath309 , @xmath356 and @xmath357 . in this case from ( [ example2 ] ) , we have @xmath358 see figures 1 - 4 for plots of the density @xmath5 , the difference @xmath359 ( where @xmath342 is obtained by the above method with @xmath360 , yielding a grid of @xmath361 points and a few minutes computation time on an average laptop ) , the ratio @xmath362 and the ratio @xmath363 respectively .",
    "the second explicit example is taken again from example 2 with @xmath328 and @xmath364 and @xmath365 . in this case from ( [ example2 ] ) , we have @xmath366 it is important to note that @xmath102 satisfies @xmath367 with @xmath368 . in this case , figures 5 -8 show plots plots of the density @xmath5 , the difference @xmath359 , the ratio @xmath362 and the ratio @xmath369 respectively .",
    "next we look at two examples where no formula for @xmath5 is available .",
    "the first one is when @xmath0 is a stable subordinator with drift , i.e. @xmath370 and @xmath371 , where we take @xmath372 .",
    "see figures 9 & 10 for a plot of @xmath342 and the ratio @xmath363 respectively . note that this is an example of a lvy measure satisfying ( [ conv_eq_def ] ) with parameter @xmath7 .    finally , the second example is a subordinator @xmath0 with zero drift and lvy measure of the form @xmath373 .",
    "figure 11 shows @xmath342 for @xmath374 ( blue ) , @xmath375 ( purple ) and @xmath376 ( green ) respectively .",
