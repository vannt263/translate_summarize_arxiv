    "the galactic center hosts the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) observed as the compact radio source sgr  a * , which is surrounded by the nuclear star cluster ( nsc ) and gaseous - dusty structures , such as hii minispiral arms of sgr  a west , supernova remnant sgr  a east , molecular clouds , and the circumnuclear disk @xcite .",
    "it is the closest smbh and hence its environment can be studied with the highest resolution among galactic nuclei in the radio- , mm- , submm- , infrared , and x - ray wavebands @xcite . however , despite high - resolution multiwavelength studies several processes are still not satisfactorily explained , such as the star - formation near the smbh , the feeding and feedback of sgr  a * , and the distribution of the magnetic field and its interaction with other stellar and non - stellar components .",
    "the observations of the galactic center region revealed a large population of young massive stars orbiting the smbh as close as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nsc seems to be one of the densest concentrations of young massive stars in the galaxy @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is an observable flat distribution of late - type stars with a radius of as much as @xmath4 .",
    "thus , a steep relaxed bahcall - wolf cusp of stars with a slope of @xmath5 or @xmath6 @xcite is probably absent .",
    "the estimates of the number of stellar remnants that use the power - law initial mass function ( imf ) ( standard salpeter or top - heavy ) combined with the mass segregation over the age of the bulge @xmath7 lead to a considerable population of stellar black holes of the order of @xmath8 @xcite . the same order is expected for neutron stars based on multiwavelength statistical studies @xcite .",
    "based on the total x - ray luminosity of the innermost parsec , @xcite set an upper limit on the number of compact remnants ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "such an abundant population of neutron stars exhibiting strong magnetic fields could be utilized to further extend our knowledge about the processes in the galactic center .",
    "the observations of neutron stars ( pulsars as well as x - ray sources ) near the smbh would contribute to :    * our understanding of the star formation processes near the galactic center using the number and the age distribution of observed sources , * mapping the gravitational potential near the smbh using their period derivatives , * constraining the electron density profile in the galactic center using their dispersion measures .    despite continuing efforts only very few pulsars have been detected in the broader galactic center region .",
    "it is thought that the lack of detections is due to profound interstellar dispersion and scattering",
    ". however , there are observational hints that such a population is present . @xcite report the discovery of two highly dispersed pulsars with the angular separation @xmath10 from the galactic center .",
    "@xcite confirm the detection of three pulsars with large dispersion measures with an offset of @xmath11@xmath12 from sgr  a*. there is an indication of the relation between the sgr  a east snr and the `` cannonball '' source , which was detected in both the x - ray and radio wavebands and appears to be a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ; * ? ? ?",
    "this shows that neutron stars can form directly in the galactic center environment .",
    "galactic plane .",
    "four logarithmic spiral arms are marked by white lines .",
    "sgr  a * and the sun are labelled as white points at position @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the data are taken from the atnf pulsar catalogue http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat @xcite . ]    in the innermost parsec only one magnetar psr j1745 - 2900 was affirmed by independent detections @xcite at a projected distance of @xmath15 from sgr  a * , having a period of 3.7635537(2 ) @xcite .",
    "the consequence of the lack of sensitivity to detect more neutron stars in the bulge and the galactic center is shown in figure  [ fig : psrxy ] , where most of the detected sources are concentrated relatively close to the sun .    in this contribution",
    "we aim to clarify the distribution of the interaction modes of neutron stars in the galactic center . based on the results we discuss the possibility of detecting neutron stars in the innermost parsec indirectly , specifically by looking for bow - shock structures similar to that of the `` cannonball '' @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : set - up ] we explain the set - up of the model and the methods that are employed , including the introduction to a simple , analytical theory of interaction modes of neutron stars that is , however , sufficient for our purposes .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ sec : distribution ] we study the distribution of interaction modes in the innermost parsec of the galaxy . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the consequences of this distribution and the possibilities of detecting a fraction of the population indirectly .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in our model we concentrate on the innermost parsec of the galactic center , which lies within the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole ( sgr  a * ) with the radius @xmath16 :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the central black hole mass and @xmath19 is the stellar velocity dispersion .    since we are studying processes that occur at a distance of @xmath20 gravitational radii from the smbh we approximate the gravitational field by a newtonian point mass of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we employ a monte carlo approach for studying the rate of interactions between neutron stars and gaseous - dusty structures .",
    "initially , we generate the orbits of neutron stars that do not gravitationally interact with each other and other stellar and non - stellar components of the nsc except for the smbh .",
    "hence , the orbital elements of individual stars do not change in the course of the simulation .",
    "although this may seem an oversimplification , it is sufficient for statistical studies of the distribution of interaction modes .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we compute the typical sizes of bow shocks and/or pwn for an ensemble of @xmath22 neutron stars , using eq . and",
    "the assumption that the gaussian distribution ( 1 ) in table  [ tab_distparam ] is approximately valid for the galactic center population . assuming that @xmath23 of interacting pulsars are ejectors , about one thousand ( in our exemplary runs @xmath24 ) bow - shock structures could be present along the minispiral arms . however , most of them are rather small @xmath25 , and are therefore below the detection limit .",
    "propeller bow shocks are all below @xmath26 , whereas the bow - shock structures of ejectors have sizes above this value and up to @xmath27 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_bowshock ] ( left panel ) for comparison ; the values along the horizontal axis are decadic logarithms of stand - off radii in milliarcseconds .",
    "the number of larger bow - shock structures @xmath28 is @xmath29 for @xmath24 neutron stars that interact with the minispiral out of @xmath30 neutron stars that occupy the innermost parsec . however , only @xmath31 of them are greater than @xmath32 . fig .",
    "[ fig_bowshock ] ( right panel ) compares their sizes with the whole minispiral structure , as seen from the earth for an exemplary simulation .",
    "in addition , neutron stars are expected to occur closer to the smbh , where relativistic effects could be detected",
    ". they may be members of the s - cluster , where they were originally locked in binary systems with hot stars .",
    "close pericenter passages can , however , disrupt such binary systems due to triple scattering .",
    "the components become separated , and for a certain set of orbital parameters , one component can escape the system on a hyperbolic orbit .",
    "these hypervelocity neutron stars could potentially be seen to interact with the gaseous environment of sgr  a west and further away .",
    "the hii region of sgr  a west , especially the dense minispiral arms and the bar , seem to be a promising target to search for the effects of interaction with passing compact objects , both for the number of encounters and for the observable effects .",
    "due to its large size , the minispiral appears to be a more favourable target for detecting the manifestation of the neutron star population than an isolated clump , such as g2/dso currently observed in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "we have studied the distribution of interaction modes of the neutron star population in the galactic center . we have explained that the established mode of interaction depends on the intrinsic properties of a neutron star ( the rotational period and the magnetic dipole surface intensity ) and the external conditions ( parameters of the gaseous medium : density and temperature ) .",
    "we focused on the distribution of three main interaction regimes of neutron stars : ejector ( e ) , propeller ( p ) , and accretor ( a ) .",
    "we found that the distribution of the modes is strongly dependent on the plasma density , while it is only weakly dependent on the temperature in the range @xmath33 .",
    "this further implies that the distribution varies across different galaxy types .",
    "we went on to propose an alternative way to look for ejecting neutron stars in the galactic center .",
    "one can look for the signatures of the interaction of neutron stars with the dense minispiral arms .",
    "common structures associated with the supersonic motion of pulsars are bow - shocks .",
    "our analysis shows that the number of relatively large structures in this region , @xmath34 , can be of the order of @xmath31 .",
    "however , we stress that the results depend on the assumed distribution of the rotational periods and the surface magnetic fields .",
    "the comparison of different synthetic distributions of bow - shock sizes with the observed structures will help to constrain the parameters of the galactic center population of young neutron stars .",
    "these bow - shocks are expected to be sources of polarized non - thermal radiation , possibly detectable in the x - ray , infrared , and radio wavelengths .",
    "several cases of such comet - shaped sources are indeed observed in this region .",
    "further analysis is required to strengthen or reject their association with propagating neutron stars . in our upcoming paper",
    "we will further explore the observability of these features ( zajaek et al .",
