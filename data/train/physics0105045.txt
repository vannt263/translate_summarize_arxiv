    "for instance , a plasma is a system of @xmath0 charged particles in interaction . a relevant issue , both for fundamental and computational reasons , is to test whether the kinetic description may hide truly physical , finite-@xmath0 , behaviors .",
    "we address this issue for a typical example where long - range interactions come into play , namely wave - particle interactions , which are ubiquitous in the physics of hot plasmas @xcite .    restricting to the electrostatic and collisionless case",
    ", it has been shown that the interaction of resonant particles with langmuir long - wavelength modes can be described by a hamiltonian self - consistent model , instead of the traditional vlasov - poisson kinetic approach .",
    "we consider the case where particles interact with a single mode . in section",
    "ii , we present the single - wave hamiltonian model , whose universal features were recently emphasized in different contexts @xcite .",
    "the essential property of this model is its mean - field nature  : resonant particles only interact with the wave , which is the only effective collective degree of freedom representing longitudinal oscillations of bulk particles .",
    "these bulk particles , whose individual characters are absent from the physical mechanism at work , namely wave - particle interaction , are then eliminated in our approach . there are thus no direct particle - particle interactions in our model .",
    "there is only a mean - field coupling , which enables one to derive rather directly its kinetic limit @xcite .",
    "we use this single wave - particle model to investigate the discrepancies between kinetic and finite-@xmath0 approaches .",
    "numerically , the finite-@xmath0 hamiltonian microscopic dynamics is computed through a symplectic code , whereas the numerical implementation of the kinetic counterpart of this system involves a semi - lagrangian vlasov solver .",
    "in section iii , we focus on long time numerical simulations of both kinetic and finite-@xmath0 systems for initial conditions modeling bump - on - tail beam - plasma instability or damping .",
    "we review the well - known results of linear theory and show how long time behaviors are intrinsically related to the non - linear regime .",
    "our model offers a good alternative to address the recently controversial issue @xcite of the long - time evolution encountered in the vlasov - poisson system . in section iv , we analyse quantitatively the finite-@xmath0 effects . in particular , we show how the discrepancies between kinetic and finite-@xmath0 long time behaviors can be related to the presently actively investigated topics of the possible inadequacy of gibbs thermodynamics to predict time - asymptotic dynamical behaviors in the limit @xmath2 for _ long - range _ systems .",
    "more precisely , we give hints to the non - commutation of limits @xmath3 and @xmath2 for the mean - field model .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "without collisions , plasma dynamics is dominated by collective processes .",
    "langmuir waves and their familiar landau damping and growth @xcite are a good example of these processes , with many applications , e.g. plasma heating in fusion devices and laser - plasma interactions .",
    "for simplicity we focus on the one - dimensional case , relevant to electrons confined by a strong axial magnetic field , and assume that ions act as a neutralizing fixed background .",
    "the traditional description of the interacting particles and fields then rests on the ( kinetic ) coupled set of vlasov - poisson equations @xcite .",
    "the current debate on the long - time evolution of this system hints that further insight in this fundamental process is still needed @xcite .",
    "our approach to ( langmuir ) wave - particle interaction complements this usual treatment in that , to capture the physical mechanism at work , electrons are partitioned in two populations  : bulk and tail .",
    "the idea behind this discrimination is simple  : wave - particle interaction involves the resonant tail particles whose velocity is close to the phase velocity of the wave under consideration .",
    "these waves are just the collective macroscopic degrees of freedom , capturing the longitudinal oscillations of other non - resonant , bulk particles , so that these bulk particles participate in the effective wave - particle dynamics only through the waves .",
    "langmuir modes are thus collective oscillations of bulk particles , represented by slowly varying complex amplitudes in an envelope approximation",
    ". their interaction with individual tail particles is described by a self - consistent set of hamiltonian equations @xcite .",
    "these already provided an efficient basis @xcite for investigating the cold beam plasma instability and exploring the nonlinear regime of the bump - on - tail instability @xcite . analytically , they yield an intuitive and rigorous derivation of spontaneous emission and landau damping of langmuir waves @xcite .",
    "besides , as it eliminates the rapid plasma oscillation scale @xmath4 , this self - consistent model offers a genuine tool to investigate long - time dynamics .",
    "we discuss the case of one wave interacting with the particles .",
    "though a broad spectrum of unstable waves is generally excited when tail particles form a warm beam , the single - wave situation can be realized experimentally @xcite and allows leaving aside the difficult problem of mode coupling mediated by resonant particles @xcite .",

    ", we can address the influence of the finite number of particles on the long - time behavior of the system .",
    "this question is eluded by the kinetic vlasov - poisson description , and one might argue that finite @xmath0 is analogous to numerical discretisation in solving kinetic equations .",
    "thus we investigate the kinetic limit , @xmath36 . as there is no direct particle - particle interaction in our model ( [ expham ] ) , it is possible to express in a simple way the @xmath36 limit through a parallel treatment of the particles and the wave .",
    "the mean - field coupling between collective ( wave ) and individual ( particles ) degrees of freedom enables one to avoid the derivation of a full bbgky hierarchy .    in the kinetic limit @xmath36",
    ", the discrete distribution @xmath37 is thus replaced with a density @xmath38 , and system ( [ vdot])-([accel ] ) yields the vlasov - wave system @xmath39 @xmath40 for initial data approaching a smooth function @xmath41 as @xmath42 , the solutions of ( [ vdot])-([accel ] ) have been proved to converge to those of the vlasov - wave system ( [ vkin])-([vlakin ] ) over any finite time interval @xcite .",
    "this legitimizes our comparison between finite @xmath0 and kinetic behaviors .",
    "the kinetic model ( [ vkin])-([vlakin ] ) is integrated numerically by a semi - lagrangian solver , which covers the @xmath43 space with a rectangular mesh .",
    "the function @xmath41 ( interpolated by cubic splines ) is transported along the characteristic lines of the kinetic equation , i.e. along trajectories of the original particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the truly physical effects of the discrepancies between finite @xmath0 and kinetic systems on long time simulations , we shall also compare in this article computational finite grid effects of the kinetic solver with the granular aspects of the @xmath0-particle system @xcite .",
    "the single wave model was first formulated @xcite as a simplified model to treat the instability due to a weak cold electron beam in a plasma with fixed ions . for this singular case",
    ", it was clear that retaining only a single langmuir mode was a good approximation even till some primary stage of non - linear saturation .",
    "this derivation involved natural approximations , but did not _ a priori _ preserve the hamiltonian or lagrangian structure of the dynamics ( though the latter is recovered in the final equations ) , and a more direct derivation within the hamiltonian and lagrangian formalism has been established @xcite .",
    "recently , different studies @xcite have extended the regime of application of the single - wave model to a much larger class of instabilities and have derived it in a generic way in different contexts .    j.d . crawford and a. jayaraman @xcite studied the collisionless nonlinear evolution of a weakly unstable mode , in the limit of a vanishing growth rate @xmath44 .",
    "they derived in this limit , for a multispecies vlasov plasma , the asymptotic features of the electric field and distribution functions .",
    "these reveal that the asymptotic electric field turns out to be monochromatic ( at the wavelength of the linear unstable mode ) and that the _ nonresonant _ particles respond to this electric field in an essentially linear fashion whereas the _ resonant _ particle distribution has a much more complicated structure , determined by nonlinear processes , e.g. particle trapping .",
    "that is , starting from a much wider class of instabilities than the original single wave model proposed by oneil , winfrey and malmberg @xcite , crawford and jayaraman derive asymptotic forms for the electric field and distribution functions that precisely feature the assumptions for the single wave model .",
    "d. del - castillo - negrete @xcite derived initially the single wave picture using matched asymptotic methods to treat the resonant and nonresonant particles . in the wider context of self - consistent chaotic transport in fluid dynamics",
    ", he also showed that the single - wave model provided a simplified starting point to study the difficult problem of _ active _ transport ( as opposed to the transport of _ passive _ scalars which do not affect the flow ) .",
    "actually , the single - wave model captures the essential features of the self - consistent transport of vorticity , i.e. an advective field that modifies the flow while being transported , through the constraint of a vorticity - velocity coupling .",
    "self - consistent active transport is a ubiquitous phenomenon in geophysical flows or in fusion plasmas with the problem of magnetic confinement .",
    "finally , we remark that the single wave model has close connections , to be further clarified , with systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators , such as those first studied by kuramoto @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a phase transition in the regime of landau damping @xcite , with order parameter the mean - field intensity of the wave , is a manifestation of these analogies .",
    "now we return to the original motivation of this work and review wave - beam instability and damping .",
    "let us first study linear instabilities and remark that one solution of ( [ vdot])-([accel ] ) corresponds to vanishing field @xmath45 , with particles evenly distributed on a finite set of beams with given velocities .",
    "small perturbations of this solution have @xmath46 , with rate @xmath47 solving @xcite @xmath48 for a monokinetic beam with velocity @xmath49 , ( [ disp ] ) reduces to @xmath50  ; the most unstable solution occurs for @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for a warm beam with smooth initial distribution @xmath54 ( normalized to @xmath55 ) , the continuous limit of ( [ disp ] ) yields @xmath56 for a sufficiently broad distribution ( @xmath57 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , and , for @xmath60 , one finds @xmath61 . except for the trivial solution given by @xmath62 , one",
    "easily checks that other solutions can only exist for a positive slope @xmath63 .",
    "then the perturbation is unstable as the time behavior of @xmath64 is controlled by the eigenvalue @xmath65 with positive real part , i.e. with growth rate @xmath66 . for negative slope ,",
    "one recovers the linear landau damping paradox @xcite  : the observed decay rate @xmath67 is not associated with genuine eigenvalues , but with phase mixing of eigenmodes @xcite . this is a direct consequence of the hamiltonian nature of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "this linear analysis generally fails to give the large time behavior .",
    "this is obvious for the unstable case as non - linear effects are no longer negligible when the wave intensity grows so that the bounce frequency @xmath68 of trapped particles in the wave becomes of the order of the linear growth rate @xmath69 .",
    "we used the monokinetic case as a testbed @xcite .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig001 ] , finite-@xmath0 simulations show that the unstable solution grows as predicted , until it saturates to a limit - cycle - like behavior where the trapping frequency @xmath70 oscillates between @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in this regime ,",
    "some of the initially monokinetic particles have been scattered rather uniformly over the chaotic domain , in and around the pulsating resonance , while others form a trapped bunch inside this resonance ( away from the separatrix ) as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig002 ] @xcite .",
    "this dynamics is quite well described by effective hamiltonians with few degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "note that it can not be easily followed by a numerical vlasov solver , as the initial beam has a singular velocity distribution function .    in this article",
    ", we discuss the large time behavior of the warm beam case , with @xmath73 at the wave nominal velocity @xmath74 .",
    "figure  [ fig003 ] displays three distribution functions ( in dimensionless form ) with similar velocity width ( here @xmath75 normalizes @xmath55 in each case )  :    _ ( i ) _ a function ( cd ) giving the same decay rate for all phase velocities , @xmath76 if @xmath77 and @xmath78 otherwise , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ,    _ ( ii ) _ a function ( cg ) giving a constant growth rate for all phase velocities @xcite , @xmath81 if @xmath82 and @xmath78 otherwise , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ,    _ ( iii ) _ a truncated lorentzian ( tl ) with positive slope @xmath83 $ ] if @xmath84 and @xmath78 otherwise , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    for the growing case , nonlinearities result from the growth of the wave intensity . for the damping case ,",
    "the linear description introduces time secularities which ultimately may cause the linear theory to break down .",
    "the ultimate evolution is intrinsically nonlinear , not only if the initial field amplitude is large , as in oneil s seminal trapping picture for one wave @xcite , but also if one considers the system evolution over time scales of the order of the trapping time ( which may be large if the initial wave amplitude is small ) .",
    "the question of the long - time fate of plasma wave amplitude is thus far from trivial @xcite .",
    "though some simulations @xcite suggest that nonlinear plasma waves eventually approach a bernstein - greene - kruskal steady state @xcite instead of a landau vanishing field , the answer should rather strongly depend on initial conditions @xcite .",
    "our @xmath0-particle , 1-wave system is the simplest model to test these ideas .",
    "first of all let us mention that for finite @xmath0 , the particles are initially distributed in @xmath43 so that their distribution approaches @xmath41 smoothly in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite .      a thermodynamical analysis @xcite predicts that , for a warm beam ( i.e. if the velocity distribution @xmath41 has a large width , as in fig .  [ fig003 ] ) and small enough initial wave amplitude , @xmath87 asymptotically scales as @xmath88 in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "figure  [ fig004 ] shows the evolution of a small amplitude wave launched in the beam .",
    "the @xmath0-particle system ( curve n ) and the kinetic system ( curve v ) initially damp exponentially as predicted by perturbation theory @xcite , for a time of the order of @xmath90 .",
    "after that phase - mixing time , trapping induces nonlinear evolution and both systems evolve differently . for the @xmath0 -particle system",
    ", the wave grows to a thermal level that scales as @xmath88 , corresponding to a balance between damping and spontaneous emission @xcite . for the kinetic system ,",
    "initial landau damping is followed by slowly damped trapping oscillations around a mean value  ; this mean value also decays to zero , at a rate which decreases for refined mesh size .",
    "figure  [ fig004 ] thus reveals that finite @xmath0 and vlasov behaviors can considerably diverge as spontaneous emission is taken into account .",
    "figure  [ fig005 ] represents the time evolution of the wave amplitude for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "it clearly shows how finite-@xmath0 wave evolutions depart progressively from the @xmath91 curve ( the later for larger @xmath0 ) .",
    "one should also notice , from figs  [ fig004 ] and [ fig005 ] and for sufficiently large @xmath0 , the onset of nonlinear effects at large time",
    ". in spite of the smallness of the initial values of the wave amplitude , nonlinear effects ( through trapping ) eventually come into play and stop landau exponential decay , marking the beginning of a different dynamical regime for which the decay is far slower .",

    "line v2 suggests that a kinetic approach would predict a level close to the trapping saturation level on a time scale awarded by reasonable integration time .",
    "this level is fairly below the thermodynamic level @xmath101 predicted by a gibbsian approach @xcite .",
    "such pathological relaxation properties in the @xmath2 limit seem common to mean - field long - range models @xcite .",
    "both kinetic simulations also exhibit a strong damping of trapping oscillations , which disappear after a few oscillations , whereas finite-@xmath0 simulations show persistent trapping oscillations .",
    "one could expect that finite-@xmath0 effects would mainly damp these oscillations , so that the wave amplitude reaches a plateau .",
    "however their amplitude does not depend on the number of particles @xmath0 , which shows that they are not an artifact due to ` poor accuracy ' of finite-@xmath0 simulations .",
    "moreover the wave amplitude slowly grows further , whereas the velocity distribution function flattens over wider intervals of velocity @xcite .",

    "for this purpose , introduce the complex field @xmath108 in the kinetic vlasov limit , it is the first fourier component of the spatial density @xmath109 a spatially homogeneous phase space with independent particles corresponds obviously to a @xmath110 scaling as @xmath88 i.e. to a vanishing @xmath111 . from ( [ vdot ] ) , and dropping the superscript @xmath112 , it follows that @xmath113 putting @xmath114 one obtains from ( [ relvdotm ] ) @xmath115 moreover , if the wave amplitude displays a sinusoidal temporal evolution ( e.g. due to trapping oscillations , then @xmath116 ) such that @xmath117 with @xmath118 the amplitude of oscillations and @xmath119 the ( quadratic ) average bounce pulsation , one obtains @xmath120 so that taking the time average , denoted by @xmath121 , of the square of both ( [ rel1 ] ) and ( [ rel2 ] ) one gets @xmath122 provided that @xmath123 has a uniform distribution ( e.g. if @xmath124 for some @xmath125 ) .",
    "this simplified model , supposing only a harmonic oscillation for @xmath126 , shows that the amplitude of the wave oscillations depends directly on the occurrence of @xmath43-space inhomogeneities .",
    "actually , for a homogeneous phase space , ( [ relatrap1 ] ) implies that @xmath127 scales at most as @xmath88 and vanishes in the kinetic limit .",
    "however , consider now the case where @xmath123 is the barycentric position , in the reference frame of the wave , of an inhomogeneity ( clump ) composed of a finite fraction @xmath128 of the particles .",

    "a striking example is given by the cold beam - wave instability @xcite , for which a macroscopic fraction of the particles belong to a so - called _ macroparticle _ that oscillates near the bottom ( elliptic point ) of the potential well and drives the wave amplitude oscillations as shown in fig .",

    "another illustration of ( [ relatrap2 ] ) is given by figs  2 and 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in vlasov simulations , as the spatial resolution @xmath134 is increased , one observes a more refined phase space that reveals some heterogeneities for the larger value of @xmath134 .",
    "this simultaneously goes with pronounced trapping oscillations at large @xmath134 while the rough resolution , which has smeared out the thin filamentation in the vortices , is associated to a flat , constant amplitude in time .",
    "we now discuss the actual process by which the wave - particle system relaxes . for this purpose , one can get a flavor of the stochasticity ( strong or weak depending on resonance overlapping or not ) that a test particle would encounter in @xmath43 space at different stages of the evolution .    in the equation of motion ( [ accel ] ) of any particle in the system ( [ expham ] )",
    "@xmath135 the time dependence of the wave modulates the force on the test particle .",

    "the low frequency bias induced by the slow growth of the amplitude evolution has been removed by subtracting the quadratic best fit of the wave evolution .",

    "two types of chaos must be distinguished .",
    "the simplest one is related to the classical overlap between the resonances of two waves @xcite propagating at velocities @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",

    "the stochasticity parameter @xcite estimated as @xmath163 is small for all @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "this means that the effective many - wave field does not generate strong chaos in velocity ranges away from the wave nominal velocity .",
    "similarly , one may search for chaos induced by the overlap between the component in ( [ effacc ] ) with phase velocity @xmath166 , and the central resonance , with phase velocity 0 .",
    "their resonance overlap @xcite parameter @xmath167 is not large enough in our system to induce large scale chaos , transporting particles from the neighborhood of the wave nominal velocity ( with its natural width @xmath168 ) to the neighborhood of waves with significantly different phase velocities .",
    "the second type of chaos is related to the resonant forcing by fourier components with phase velocity @xmath169 , on the periodic motion induced by the main field component .",
    "this process applies in the vicinity of the separatrix of the main resonance and must be discussed using action - angle variables .",
    "as recalled in the appendix , the corresponding pulsations are smaller than @xmath170 for untrapped particles , and smaller than @xmath156 for trapped particles ( and for untrapped ones very close to the separatrix ) .",
    "particles experiencing this chaos easily cross the pulsating separatrix , i.e. change between trapped and untrapped motion .",

    "this supports the analysis of chaos in our system as ` slow chaos ' due to the pulsating resonance @xcite .",
    "however , corresponding amplitudes @xmath172 are much smaller than @xmath173 .",
    "therefore , the pulsating resonance does not sweep the vicinity of the bottom of the wave potential well , which allows the particles close to the elliptic point to move quite regularly , forming a macroparticle like in fig .",
    "[ fig002 ] .",
    "this bottom of the well may be separated from the surrounding chaotic domain ( swept by the separatrix ) by kam surfaces in @xmath174 space @xcite .",
    "the more chaotic behaviour is expected in the case where the additional peaks , close to @xmath156 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , are more important .",
    "as this is the case @xmath146 , our analysis is consistent with the faster transport in velocity observed for the smaller values of @xmath0 and thus with the more rapid thermalization in this case .",

    "[ fig008 ] ) , it is striking to note that the differences between both spectra are strongly reduced , so that one can estimate that a test particle feels a similar amount of stochasticity for both values of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the relative intensity of the secondary resonances is smaller than in the time interval @xmath142 , so that the separatrix pulsations will be relatively smaller . as a result",
    ", the chaotic growth of the wave also slows down .",
    "by contrast , the vlasov simulations , with their induction of coarse graining , even prevent the evolution of the system towards this second stage . actually , these codes are unable to capture the spatial details of the phase space filamentation which are under the scale of the mesh size , so that , after a certain stage , they artificially make the system almost integrable",
    ".      finally , our numerical observations along with equation ( [ relatrap1 ] ) enable one to describe properly the finite-@xmath0 effects on the thermalization process .",
    "due to the initial asymmetry in velocity space ( the initial distribution function has a positive slope around the wave phase velocity ) , heterogeneities will exist in the wave resonance during the first nonlinear oscillations .",
    "if @xmath0 is increased , the ( weak ) chaos available to thermalize the system disappears , and the system is driven by the filamentary structure which develops inside the wave potential well .",
    "the bottom of the well is an elliptic point for the model , around which the correlations between trajectories may decay algebraically @xcite , so that the filaments get thinner and more entangled as time goes on .",
    "the filamentation described here mixes particles in the neighborhood of the wave resonance .",
    "particles with velocities far away from the resonance are weakly sensitive to the resonance , which they essentially average off .",
    "therefore , as @xmath0 becomes very large , the system long - time evolution is dependent on initial conditions in the neighborhood of the resonance , and thermodynamical conclusions ( relying on ergodicity in the energy surface and basic conservation laws ) no longer apply .",
    "now , to what extent do actual vlasov simulations reproduce either the kinetic equation evolution or the finite-@xmath0 evolution  ? crudely speaking , kinetic simulations start to induce a bias with respect to the vlasov equation , because of phase space averaging , when the distribution function exhibits structures on scales below their grid resolution ( and this is bound to happen ) .",
    "one might expect that finer grids would enable one to describe more precisely the long - time evolution of the system .",
    "however , refined grids also reduce the coarseness of the particle distribution in @xmath43 space , and inhibit the noisy separatrix crossings .",
    "this in turn inhibits the wave second growth , which results from the coarseness of the particle distribution for an actual finite value of @xmath0 .",
    "our observations indicate that kinetic models are too idealized , in comparison with finite @xmath0 , and do not contain all the intricate behavior displayed by a discrete particles system .",
    "this can also be tested within kinetic theory .",
    "in particular , whereas the kinetic equation analytically preserves integral functionals of @xmath41 like the 2-entropy @xmath177 , numerical schemes increase @xmath178 significantly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig009 ] , when constant-@xmath41 contours form filaments in @xmath43-space on scales below the grid mesh .",
    "this filamentation ( due to anisochronism of nonlinear trapped motion , or shear in @xmath43-space ) is smoothed by numerical partial differential equation integrators , while @xmath0-body dynamics follows the particles more realistically , sustaining the trapping oscillations .",
    "this inability of the semi - lagrangian scheme in reproducing the filamentation over small scales is shared by other vlasov schemes .",
    "in particular , particle - in - cell ( pic ) schemes explicitly replace the actual @xmath0 particles of the initial dynamics by effective particles , which are redefined smoothly at each time step .",
    "pic schemes have a further disadvantage in comparison with semi - lagrangian schemes .",
    "they put the numerical effort on cells according to their populations  ; by contrast , semi - lagrangian schemes ensure a similar accuracy for the poorly populated @xmath43-space domains as for the highly populated ones @xcite , so that they describe frontiers in @xmath41 more sharply .",
    "this discussion shows that the ` irreversible ' growth of the wave is not related to the entropy production of this sub - grid - scale filamentation but to the chaotic trapping - detrapping process ( of which some small - scale structures are by - products ) .",
    "although the smoothing may appear as a minor nuisance in the chaotic @xmath43 regions , it does actually force a distinctly different evolution in the long term , and refining the mesh does not prevent this .",
    "in summary , dealing with the basic propagation of a single electrostatic wave in a warm plasma , we presented finite-@xmath0 effects which do not merely result from numerical errors and are missed in a kinetic simulation approach .",
    "their understanding depends crucially on describing the particle dynamics in @xmath43 space .",
    "the sensitive dependence of the microscopic chaotic evolution to the fine structure of the initial particle distribution in @xmath43 space @xcite implies that the limits @xmath179 and @xmath180 do not commute .",
    "the driving process in the system evolution is separatrix crossing , which requires a geometric approach to the system dynamics .",
    "further work in this direction will also shed new light on the foundations of frequently used approximations , such as replacing original dynamics ( [ phi])-([force ] ) by coupled stochastic equations , in which particles undergo noisy transport .",
