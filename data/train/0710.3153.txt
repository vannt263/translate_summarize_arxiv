    "electrical circuits containing nanoscale junctions are central to nanoscience and condensed matter physics .",
    "the importance comes both from the conceptual issues they raise and the possibility of qualitatively smaller electronic devices with new electrical properties @xcite .",
    "examples include metallic atomic - scale point contacts that exhibit quantized conductance @xcite and organic molecules linking conducting leads . these latter may form non - resonant tunnel junctions @xcite or single molecule devices whose conductance is controlled by a kondo resonance @xcite .",
    "the challenge to theory is twofold .",
    "first , the atomic scale specifics of chemical bonding and local structure can profoundly influence local potentials and energy alignments for the electronic states that control conduction .",
    "second , even if electron - electron interactions in the leads are well screened and may be effectively incorporated into the energy bands , interactions on the molecule are typically not small , and may strongly affect the conductance and the spectrum .",
    "the important role played by the chemical and structural details has led to a strong emphasis in the literature on self consistent theories , often utilizing approximate implementations of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . in these theories the atomic scale potential and the local bonding structure",
    "are treated in detail while the conductance is calculated via a landauer approach based on the electronic states derived from the self consistent hamiltonian @xcite . however , these approaches treat excited states in a mean field manner and there remain significant questions concerning the role of electron correlations and whether the important energy levels are accurately represented by the mean field theories that are utilized @xcite .",
    "the self consistent dft approach has proved to be relatively accurate for metallic point contacts and certain molecular junctions with conductance near @xmath0 , the quantum of conductance@xcite .",
    "however , detailed comparison between experiment and self consistent calculations of conductance through single molecule junctions has generally shown a large discrepency , up to several orders of magnitude in the non - resonant tunneling regime @xcite .",
    "typically the measured conductance is smaller than the calculated conductance .",
    "unfortunately , these comparisons are complicated by substantial variability in the measured values for the same molecule and signficant uncertainty about the atomic scale structure of the junction near the single molecule link @xcite .",
    "calculations are typically performed for relatively idealized junction structures and the conductance can be sensitive to the local geometry for widely used thiol linkages @xcite .",
    "the impact of uncertainties in the junction structure on the comparison ( i.e. of not performing the calculations for the relevant bonding configuration ) has recently been clarified , following the discovery that amine linked junctions produce single molecule junctions with reproducible conductance measurements , a result that was understood to derive from a selective bonding motif @xcite .",
    "a study of the impact of amine - gold link structures on junction conductance for benzenediamine gave strong support to the selectivity of the bonding and showed good agreement between theory and experiment for the distribution of conductance @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of the calculated conductance exceeded the measured value by a factor of seven .",
    "this suggests that even after the junction structure is reliably accounted for , discrepancies remain and points to the importance of correlation effects beyond the the commonly used dft based self consistent approach .",
    "these challenges have stimulated theoretical research along a number of lines , including implementing self interaction corrections @xcite in order to obtain improved estimates of energy level alignment , correlated basis function techniques @xcite to improve the description of the electronic wave functions , fundamental analyses of the application of dft to electronic transport to go beyond the landauer approach while remaining within the dft framework @xcite , and finally diagrammatic perturbation analyses of beyond - dft correlation effects @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the last issue , namely the dynamical consequences of the on - molecule interactions . to discuss the essential physics ,",
    "we restrict attention to a single resonance coupled to metallic leads and including the local coulomb interaction , the single - impurity anderson model @xcite .",
    "we do not consider many body effects associated with interactions in the leads or between the molecule and the leads .",
    "the present work examines equilibrium properties and conductance in the linear response regime only .",
    "we present a numerically exact quantum monte carlo solution to this simple model as a benchmark against which other approximate approaches can be compared . as an example of such a comparison",
    ", we analyse the gw approximation for the electron self energy @xcite .",
    "the gw approach @xcite has been applied in full detail to succesfully predict the quasiparticle energies for a wide range of solids , surfaces , molecules and nanosystems @xcite .",
    "motivated by these successes , and noting that it is a conserving approximation @xcite , several authors have begun to apply the gw approximation to calculate the electronic properties of single - molecule conductors@xcite .",
    "however , it is far from clear under what circumstances the gw approximation will accurately treat the local correlations and the resulting transport phenomena .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the model , section iii describes the methods ( touching on the issue of the proper definition of the gw approximation for a local orbital ) , section iv presents results for the level filling , conductance , and spectral function , section v discuss the gw approximation and section vi is a conclusion .",
    "an appendix presents some details of the derivation of the gw equations we use .",
    "we study the simplest possible model of a molecular junction : a single level which may hold 0 , 1 or 2 electrons , has an interaction term which controls the energy of the two electron state , and is coupled to an electronic continuum which represents the leads and is taken to be noninteracting .",
    "this is the anderson impurity model @xcite , represented by the hamiltonian @xmath1 here @xmath2 creates an electron of spin @xmath3 on the localized level ( energy @xmath4 ) and the @xmath5 term describes the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "@xmath7 creates an electron of spin @xmath3 in the lead state with energy @xmath8 .",
    "because we will be concerned only with equilibrium properties , a restriction to a single electronic continuum is possible : in a two - lead situation one combination of lead states decouples from the problem and the state created by @xmath9 really refers to an electron in the appropriate  hybridizing \" linear combination .",

    "there are four states : the empty state @xmath41 with energy @xmath42 , the fully occupied state @xmath43 with energy @xmath44 and a magnetic doublet @xmath45 or @xmath46 with energy @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 spectral function depends on the occupancy : if @xmath49 , the ground state is @xmath41 and the spectral function consists of an addition peak at @xmath50 .",

    "the analysis of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath78 and the evaluation of the gw approximation for the self energy operator with the the exact ( qmc ) @xmath116 and @xmath78 showed that vertex corrections are quite significant in these cases . unfortunately , while there are systematic guidelines for including vertex corrections properly so as to maintain a conserving approximation , the resulting theory is substantially more complex @xcite .",

    "the screened interaction @xmath78 is related to the spin - spin correlation function through the polarizability @xmath183 @xcite : @xmath184 where : @xmath185[n_{\\sigma'}(0)-\\langle n_{\\sigma'}(0)\\rangle ] \\right\\}\\rangle\\ ] ] in the spin - dependent case , the @xmath186 term in the interaction implies that @xmath187 involves only the correlator for the opposite spin , so one finds the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath188    on the other hand , for the spin - independent interaction , all spin indices are involved and one obtains @xmath189 thus we see that the spin - dependent interaction reproduces approximately the analytically known asymptotic behavior of the self - energy @xmath190 $ ] whereas the spin - independent interaction does not .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is only approximately reproduced because gw can not account correctly for @xmath191 .",

    "the spin - independent case provides a much worse approximation , which would be wrong even if the exact correlations functions were used .",
    "this is an indication that the spin - dependent 2-particle interaction is to be prefered over the spin - independent one in the context of the gw approximation applied to the anderson model .",

    "comparison to the lowest temperature qmc result shows that the lineshape calculated from the spin - dependent gw approximation is closer to the qmc lineshape than is the result of the spin - independent calculation .",
    "this is because the spin - dependent approach is free of self - interaction effects and it accounts for some of spin - spin quantum fluctuations , whereas the spin - independent approach accounts only for density - density quantum fluctuations ."
