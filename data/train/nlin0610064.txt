    "catalytic surface reactions are a large class of chemical reactions with important applications .",
    "they are often accompanied by oscillations , and a rich variety of wave patterns , as well as chemical turbulence , can be observed in such systems @xcite .",
    "an extensively studied surface reaction is co oxidation on single crystals of platinum . when the reaction takes place on the crystallographic plane pt(110 ) , a structural phase transition in the top layer of the substrate is coupled to the reaction , making oscillations and excitability possible .",
    "these kinetic regimes are well reproduced by the theoretical model of krischer , eiswirth and ertl @xcite where reaction - induced surface reconstruction is taken into account .",
    "the bifurcation analysis of this model shows that it has a supercritical hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a region of parameter space the uniform oscillations in this system may be unstable with respect to the modulational benjamin - feir instability , leading to the spontaneous development of turbulence @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the vicinity of the hopf bifurcation , the co oxidation reaction approximately obeys the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it may be difficult to maintain the reaction so close to the bifurcation line that the oscillations have a harmonic character and their amplitude is small .",
    "nonetheless , many qualitative features of the wave patterns typically found in the cgle are also observed in the co oxidation reaction on pt(110 ) under oscillatory conditions . in particular , the spontaneous development of amplitude turbulence through the nucleation of spiral wave pairs has been found in this system science , bertrampreexp , bertramjpc .",
    "thus , the co oxidation reaction on pt(110 ) provides an opportunity to experimentally investigate the general phenomena of spatiotemporal chaos in weakly nonlinear oscillatory reaction - diffusion systems .    to control the co oxidation reaction , the partial pressure of co in the gas above the catalytic surface can be modulated in time by varying the dosing rate of co into the reaction chamber .",
    "the modulation of the co pressure changes reaction conditions in the same way in all surface elements and , therefore , its effect is global . by making the modulation dependent on the properties of monitored patterns , global feedback can be introduced in the reaction system .",
    "suppression of chemical turbulence and development of new , feedback - induced wave patterns , including regimes of intermittent spatiotemporal chaos , have been experimentally observed science , bertrampreexp , beta and theoretically investigated science , bertrampretheor for the co oxidation reaction .",
    "alternatively , external periodic modulation of the partial co pressure can be applied , leading to a periodic forcing of this chemical reaction . in experiments",
    "@xcite , entrainment of co oscillations by such periodic forcing has been detected , but spatially - resolved observations of concentration wave patterns on the platinum surface were not then possible .",
    "subsequently , spatially - resolved experiments on periodic forcing of chemical turbulence in this reaction were performed @xcite .",
    "in addition to full entrainment with uniform oscillations , regimes with oscillating cells or labyrinthine patterns , and cascades of amplitude defects characteristic of spatiotemporal intermittency , were observed .",
    "effects of periodic forcing have also been experimentally investigated in the oscillatory belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite , where uniform oscillations are , however , always stable and spontaneous development of turbulence is not known .",
    "previous theoretical studies @xcite of fronts separating different phase - locked states in the periodically forced cgle have shown that , under the conditions of the benjamin - feir instability , such fronts may undergo `` explosions '' as the forcing amplitude is decreased .",
    "when such an explosion occurs , the interfacial region separating the two locked states grows and eventually fills the entire medium with a turbulent phase .",
    "similar phenomena were also found in coupled map lattice models klop , klp .    in this paper , the effects of front explosions under 2:1 and 3:1 resonant forcing are studied in the realistic model of co oxidation on pt(110 ) for parameter values typical for the experiments on this chemical reaction where non - harmonic oscillations with substantial amplitudes are observed . as we show",
    ", front explosions occur in very different ways in these two resonant regimes .",
    "our work provides a framework for future experimental studies of front explosions in the co oxidation reaction .",
    "we consider the realistic model @xcite of catalytic co oxidation on a pt(110 ) surface .",
    "the model takes into account adsorption of co and o@xmath0 molecules , reaction , desorption of co molecules , the structural phase transition of the pt(110 ) surface , and the surface diffusion of adsorbed co molecules . letting @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the surface coverage of co and o at position @xmath3 , respectively , and @xmath4 the local fraction of the surface area found in the non - reconstructed @xmath5 form , the reaction - diffusion equations giving the time evolution of these fields are @xmath6(1-u - v)^{2 } \\notag \\\\ & & -k_{3}\\,u\\,v )   \\notag \\\\ w_{t } & = & k_{5}\\left ( \\frac{1}{1+\\exp ( \\frac{u_{0}-u}{\\delta u})}-w\\right)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\]]all three fields can vary in the interval from @xmath7 $ ] and we define @xmath8 for future reference . for an explanation and specification of the values of the parameters see table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "although certain features , such as surface roughening , faceting , formation of subsurface oxygen , and the effects of internal gas - phase coupling are not taken into account , this model has proven to be remarkably successful in describing most aspects of the experimental observations on this system .",
    "in particular , it is able to capture oscillations in the co oxidation process seen under some experimental conditions .",
    ".parameters of the model . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     we are interested in situations where the catalytic surface reaction is subjected to external periodic forcing . experimentally , it is convenient to periodically modulate the co partial pressure @xmath9 . consequently , we assume in this paper that @xmath9 varies according to the equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the amplitude of the forcing and @xmath12 the frequency of the forcing .",
    "the base value of partial co pressure is @xmath13 . in the present study the parameter values of the partial pressures",
    "are chosen such that in the absence of forcing uniform oscillations are unstable with respect to small perturbations and chemical turbulence spontaneously develops in the unperturbed system .",
    "the reaction itself is oscillatory with period @xmath14s for @xmath15 .",
    "numerical simulations of the model were performed using a first - order finite difference scheme for the spatial discretization with a grid resolution of @xmath16 m . for the temporal discretization",
    "an explicit euler scheme with a fixed time step @xmath17s was used .",
    "the system size was @xmath18mm@xmath19 and no - flux boundary conditions were imposed .",
    "we suppose that when periodic forcing is applied to the system it is locked in an @xmath20 resonance . in this case",
    "there are @xmath21 distinct phases of the oscillation .",
    "chemical fronts separating pairs of these @xmath21 resonantly locked states can be formed by a suitable choice of initial conditions . in particular , in a two - dimensional domain , we choose initial conditions such that the left and the right half planes are homogeneous but in two different phases , respectively , and separated by a small interfacial zone where the field values are chosen at random .    under conditions where the unforced system is benjamin - feir unstable and",
    "the forcing amplitude is sufficiently large , such initial conditions generate a front separating the homogeneous phases which has the form of an interfacial zone delineated by left and right profiles .",

    "we can thus define the interfacial zone as @xmath28 .",
    "the dynamics of the front can be analyzed in terms of several quantities that characterize its structure .",
    "the instantaneous intrinsic thickness of the interfacial zone at position @xmath29 along the front is given by @xmath30 the spatial average @xmath31 of the intrinsic thickness may be computed from @xmath32 where , henceforth , the angle brackets will refer to a spatial average along @xmath33 .",
    "we also define the instantaneous position of the front at a point @xmath29 along the front by @xmath34 and the instantaneous mean position as @xmath35 . after a transient time",
    ", the phase front dynamics is observed to enter a statistically stationary regime where the temporal average of the time derivatives of @xmath35 and @xmath31 are independent of time .",
    "these quantities are called the front velocity @xmath36 and the interface growth rate @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath38 then the interface has an average finite thickness which is denoted by @xmath39 .    studies of the 3:1 resonantly forced complex ginzburg - landau equation have shown that if the amplitude of the forcing is reduced , a critical value is reached where the average thickness of the interfacial zone @xmath40 is no longer finite . for such values of the forcing , when the system starts from the two - phase initial conditions described above , the interfacial zone grows to fill the entire domain .",
    "we term this phenomenon a  front explosion \" .",
    "we now investigate this phenomenon for the resonantly forced catalytic surface oxidation reaction .",

    "special initial conditions are needed , which were not implemented in these experiments where forcing was always applied starting from the turbulent initial state .",
