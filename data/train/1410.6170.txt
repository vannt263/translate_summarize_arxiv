    "the discovery of  ( hd294598 , bd@xmath1303  1283 , 2massj06043380@xmath130311513 ) as an eclipsing binary was made by @xcite , who established an orbital period for the system of 6.110792 days . the depth reported for the primary eclipse was about 0.7 mag , but no secondary eclipse was seen in these early photographic measurements .",
    "the primary star is of solar type .",
    "the object has received little attention following the discovery , other than the occasional measurement of times of primary eclipse , which was the only eclipse detected until recently .",
    "it was claimed by @xcite to be a possible member of the collinder70 cluster , a proposal that appears to have since been dismissed .",
    "faint spectral lines of the secondary with about the same width as those of the primary were first detected in 1985 by @xcite , but remained elusive in subsequent high - resolution observations ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , no signs of the secondary eclipse could be seen in more recent photometric monitoring , implying either a very faint and cool companion , or possibly an eccentric orbit and a special orientation such that no secondary eclipses occur .",
    "this motivated us to begin our own program of spectroscopic observation in 1996 .",
    "our interest in the system was piqued when we were able to derive the first single - lined spectroscopic orbit , which is indeed eccentric but only slightly so , and to predict the exact location of the secondary eclipse , which we were then successful in detecting with more targeted photometric observations .",
    "the depth in @xmath14 is less than 3% .",
    "continued analysis has enabled us to also measure radial velocities for the secondary , and to fully characterize the binary .",
    "the confirmed presence of a late - type star in  makes it a rare example of a system containing a solar - type primary that is easy to study and provides access to other key properties of the binary , and at the same time a late - type secondary that is very faint but still measurable . as such ,  is potentially very useful for testing models of stellar evolution if accurate properties for the stars can be derived , by virtue of the greater leverage afforded by a mass ratio significantly different from unity .",
    "previous measurements for m dwarfs have shown rather serious disagreements with models in the sense that such stars appear larger and cooler than predicted by theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is now widely believed to be related to stellar activity ( magnetic inhibition of convection , and/or star spots ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there are relatively few systems containing m stars with complete information available for testing this hypothesis .    here",
    "we provide a full description of our spectroscopic and photometric observations of , leading to the first determination of accurate properties for the stars including the absolute masses and radii .",
    "we report also a detailed chemical analysis of the system based on the solar - type primary star , bypassing the usual difficulties and limitations of determining the metallicity of m stars .",
    "we additionally estimate the surface magnetic field strengths for both components , an important piece of information permitting a more meaningful comparison with recent models that incorporate magnetic fields .",
    "our results provide one of the clearest illustrations that such models are indeed able to reproduce the measured properties of low - mass stars .",
    "dates of minimum light for  were collected from the literature and from our own unpublished photometric measurements ( see table  [ tab : tmin ] ) , and were used to establish the ephemeris .",
    "the measurements ( 34 timings for the primary and 7 for the secondary ) span about 82 years , or @xmath94900 orbital cycles of the binary .",
    "uncertainties for the older timings and for some of the more recent ones have not been published , so we determined them by iterations to achieve reduced @xmath15 values near unity , separately for each type of measurement ( @xmath16 , 0.011 , and 0.0001 days for the photographic , visual , and photoelectric / ccd data ) .",
    "we found we also needed to rescale the published photoelectric / ccd errors by factors of 1.8 and 2.9 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "a linear weighted least - squares fit using the primary and secondary minima together resulted in @xmath17 which we have used in the analysis that follows .",
    "uncertainties are indicated in parentheses in units of the last significant digit .",
    "secondary eclipses occur at a phase of @xmath18 , clearly showing that the orbit is eccentric .",
    "some degree of apsidal motion is therefore expected .",
    "an ephemeris curve @xcite was fit to all the data with the same weighting scheme as above , adopting values for the eccentricity and inclination angle derived in our spectroscopic and light curve analyses below , and is illustrated in figure  [ fig : apsidal ] .",
    "however , the apsidal period is only poorly determined from this fit ( @xmath19 years ) .",

    "we obtained @xmath36k and @xmath37 .",
    "the faintness of the secondary , which has a flux some 40 times smaller than that of the primary , prevents us from determining its template parameters in a similar way .",
    "instead we relied on the temperature difference inferred from our light curve solutions in sect .",
    "[ sec : lightcurves ] , and we assumed the star is rotating synchronously .",
    "the latter is a reasonable assumption , as the timescale for synchronization of the secondary ( @xmath910@xmath38yr ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "typical uncertainties are 0.05  for the primary ( star a ) and 1.6  for the faint secondary ( star b ) .",
    "experience has shown that the very narrow wavelength range of the ds spectra ( 45 ) can sometimes lead to systematic errors in the rvs due to residual line blending as well as lines shifting in and out of the spectral window as a function of orbital phase ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we investigated this by means of numerical simulations for each spectrum , and found the effect to be significant ( shifts of up to 7  for the secondary , but only 0.02  for the primary ) .",

    "nevertheless , a common pattern seen in the figure is that all models overestimate the temperature of the secondary star by 48% , and also overestimate its surface gravity , which means they underestimate the radius ( by about 2 to 4% ) .",

    "models systematically underestimate all of the measured flux ratios by roughly a factor of two , with the absolute deviations increasing toward longer wavelengths .",

    "we note , though , that a mass for the secondary of @xmath218@xmath1 ( nearly 7% larger than measured , or @xmath918@xmath174 ) is implausibly large given our observational uncertainties , and would not make the fit to the other global properties ( @xmath219 , @xmath31 ) any better .",
    "the reason for the underpredicted @xmath186 values may be related to deficiencies in the temperature - color transformations adopted in the dartmouth models , which are based on phoenix model atmospheres @xcite , and which are known to degrade rapidly at optical wavelengths for cooler stars .",

    "figure  [ fig : mag_rot ] shows that properties of the primary star are well reproduced by the model ( represented with a solid line ) between 2.7 and 3.5 gyr , yielding an age of @xmath222 gyr , similar to our earlier finding .",
    "as discussed before , the properties of the secondary are not reproduced by the corresponding standard model .",
    "instead , theory predicts a radius that is 3.7% too small and a temperature that is 4.8% too hot compared to observations . given that standard models match the properties of the primary to a large degree",
    ", we began our magnetic model analysis by assuming only the secondary is affected by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "a small grid of magnetic stellar models was computed at a fixed mass ( 0.596@xmath1 ) and metallicity ( @xmath8 } = -0.12 $ ] ) for b. two procedures were used for modeling the influence of the magnetic field on convection that are described by @xcite .",
    "these two procedures were designed to roughly mimic the effects of two different dynamo actions : a rotational or shell dynamo ( @xmath22@xmath223 ) and a turbulent or distributed dynamo ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "all models utilized a dipole radial profile as the influence of the magnetic field is only weakly dependent on the choice of radial profile for stars with a radiative core and convective envelope @xcite . for models using the rotational dynamo procedure , values of the average surface magnetic fields",
    "were @xmath225 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3.0 kg , while for the turbulent dynamo the values were @xmath226 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 3.0 kg , in which @xmath227 is the photospheric magnetic field strength and @xmath228 the filling factor .",
    "corresponding mass tracks are show with dotted lines in figures  [ fig : mag_rot ] and [ fig : mag_turb ] , with the relative changes in radius ( @xmath229 ) and temperature ( @xmath230 ) of the secondary indicated on the right as a function of the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "results show that magnetic models of b can be made to reproduce the observed properties assuming either dynamo procedure , with the rotational dynamo suggesting @xmath231  kg and the turbulent dynamo giving @xmath232  kg . these values were calculated by extracting the properties of each magnetic model computed at an age of 3.1 gyr , and generating curves using a cubic spline interpolation that give the model radius and model temperature difference between the primary and secondary as functions of @xmath233 ( right panels of figures  [ fig : mag_rot ] and [ fig : mag_turb ] ) .",
    "the spacing of the magnetic field strength was 0.05 kg along the interpolated curves .",
    "we then computed the @xmath15 value , @xmath234 at each point along the interpolated curve and took the resulting minimum as the best - fit @xmath233 . for completeness",
    ", we note that the minimum @xmath15 value we found is @xmath235 .",
    "approximate errors for the permitted model @xmath233 were determined by satisfying the condition @xmath236 .    as shown earlier , the primary star is active as well and may be similarly influenced by its magnetic field , even though standard models seem to be able to match the observed properties without that effect . to test this , we generated magnetic models for the primary star guided by an estimate of the field strength , described in the next section , of @xmath237  g. results using the rotational dynamo formulation are shown in figure  [ fig : mag_rot ] , but produce only a negligible departure from the standard model mass track . figure  [ fig : mag_turb ] , on the other hand , demonstrates that the turbulent dynamo model causes a greater level of radius inflation and temperature suppression in the primary .",
    "temperature suppression is such that agreement is nearly lost between the model and the observations .",
    "the age prediction is reduced to @xmath238 gyr , and magnetic models of the secondary require moderately stronger @xmath233 values with the turbulent dynamo than in the previous case . performing the same procedure as before to generate the best fit value , we obtained @xmath239 kg .",
    "however , in this case we found @xmath240 , indicating the final fit is poor .",
    "this is driven by the fact that the temperature difference is more difficult to fit given the significantly lower temperature of the primary model with a magnetic field .",
    "observational evidence for activity in  is clear in the case of the primary , and although no direct signs of it are seen for the very faint secondary , we expect that star to be active as well . approximate magnetic field strengths for both stars were estimated as follows .",
    "@xcite has shown there is a power - law relationship between @xmath233 and the rossby number , @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the rotation period of the star and @xmath243 the convective turnover time .",
    "the rossby number for the primary may be estimated by noting that our spectroscopic @xmath32 measurement suggests it is rotating either synchronously or pseudo - synchronously .",
    "we will assume the latter here , although the difference is very small ( see table  [ tab : absdim ] ) .",
    "this leads to a rotation period of @xmath244days based on the measured orbital eccentricity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for @xmath243 we must rely on theory .",
    "since the calibration of @xcite used convective turnover times taken from the work of @xcite , we have done the same here for consistency , and adopted ( based on the temperature of 5890k ) @xmath245 days , with a conservative uncertainty . the resulting rossby number for a is @xmath246 .",
    "a similar calculation for the secondary gives @xmath247 based on @xmath248 days @xcite , from its temperature of 3880k , and assuming pseudo - synchronous rotation ( justified in view of the very short timescale for synchronization compared to the age of the system ; see sect .  [",
    "sec : spectroscopy ] ) .",
    "the @xcite relation then projects a magnetic field strength for the primary of @xmath249 g , and a value for the secondary of @xmath250 g , where the uncertainties account for all observational errors as well as the scatter of the calibration .",
    "the field strength for the secondary is not far from the values required by the models in the previous section , suggesting the theoretical predictions are at least plausible .",
    "a consistency check on the empirically estimated @xmath233 values may be obtained by relating these field strengths to x - ray luminosities , and comparing them against a measure of the total x - ray emission from  detected by the rosat satellite .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed in a study of magnetic field observations of the sun and active stars that there is a fairly tight power - law relationship between the x - ray luminosity and the total unsigned surface magnetic flux , @xmath251 , which is valid over many orders of magnitude .",
    "an updated relation restricted to dwarf stars was presented by @xcite .",
    "using this latter relation along with the measured stellar radii we obtain @xmath252 and @xmath253 ( with @xmath254 in erg  s@xmath25 ) .",
    "the sum of the x - ray luminosities corresponds to @xmath255 .",
    "the entry for  in the rosat all - sky survey faint source catalog @xcite lists a count rate of @xmath256ctss@xmath25 ( 0.12.4kev ) and a hardness ratio of @xmath257 for the system , from a 465s exposure .",
    "the corresponding total x - ray luminosity computed using the energy conversion factor given by @xcite and the distance in table  [ tab : absdim ] is @xmath258 .",
    "the good agreement between this measurement and the sum of the individual x - ray luminosities , @xmath259 , may be taken as an indication of the accuracy of the @xmath233 values reported above , even though their formal errors are large .",
    "to the extent that our empirical magnetic field estimates above represent the actual surface field strengths of the stars in , it seems natural to require the models for _ both _ components to account for these effects .",
    "however , the way in which the influence of magnetic fields on the stellar properties is treated in the models seems to make a significant difference , particularly for the primary star , and it is not at all clear which formulation is more realistic . given that this issue is at the heart of the long - standing problem of radius inflation and temperature suppression in cool stars , a careful consideration of the physical assumptions is in order .    based strictly on the agreement with our empirical estimates ,",
    "a scenario whereby the primary star s magnetic field is generated by a `` rotational '' dynamo and the secondary by a more `` turbulent '' dynamo would seem to be preferred . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field of the primary draws its energy largely from kinetic energy of ( differential ) rotation , with the magnetic field rooted in a strong shear layer below the convection zone ( i.e. , the tachocline ) , analogous to the mechanism believed to drive the solar dynamo @xcite .",
    "convection is then inhibited by the stabilizing effect that a ( vertical ) magnetic field has on a fluid @xcite .",
    "given the similarity of a to the sun , the adoption of this magneto - convection formulation seems justified . with a surface magnetic field strength @xmath260  g ,",
    "the influence of a magnetic field on the flow of convection is minimal and the structure of the model is unaffected ( see figure  [ fig : mag_rot ] ) , so that the magnetic model produces results consistent with the non - magnetic model .",
    "concerning the secondary , both magnetic field formulations yield agreement with the stellar properties ( @xmath31 and @xmath219 ) at an age defined by the properties of the primary ( assuming the discussion above holds ) . at face value",
    "the turbulent dynamo approach requires a field strength ( @xmath261 kg ) that is closer to the empirically estimated value of @xmath262 kg than the alternate approach with a rotational dynamo ( which predicts @xmath263 kg ) .",
    "the accuracy of the empirical value is difficult to assess and depends strongly on the reliability of the @xcite calibration .",
    "the turbulent dynamo formulation simplistically assumes that the energy for the magnetic field is provided by kinetic energy available in the larger scale convective flow .",
    "convection is then made less efficient as energy is diverted away from convecting fluid elements thereby impeding their velocity and thus reducing the total amount of convective energy flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . precisely how this conversion is achieved ( e.g. , through turbulence , helical convection , or feedback generated by the lorentz force ) is not explicitly defined in the stellar models .",
    "while consistency between the estimated surface magnetic field strength and that required by the models is encouraging , it is not clear that the dynamo mechanism at work in b should be any different from that in a. both stars possess a radiative core and a convective outer envelope and thus , presumably , a stable tachocline in which to produce a magnetic field through an interface dynamo .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a stable tachocline is not necessarily a strict condition for a solar - like dynamo @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no reason _ a priori _ to believe that the stars should have a different dynamo mechanism .",
    "if we instead assume that the primary also has a dynamo driven by convection , then the structural changes imparted by the magnetic field become significant , even for a modest 170  g magnetic field at the surface .",
    "changes induced on the primary are such that models of the primary and secondary can not be made to agree at the same age , leaving us with precisely the same problem that we were looking to correct with the magnetic models .    a possible reason to expect a different dynamo mechanism would be if differential rotation were somehow suppressed in the secondary star",
    ". quenching of differential rotation has been observed in detailed magneto - hydrodynamic simulations as a result of maxwell stresses produced by an induced magnetic field @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , simulations of a sun - like star with an angular velocity similar to a do not demonstrate this quenching @xcite , so we may posit that the primary star has a dynamo driven by differential rotation , as we initially supposed .",
    "although the two components of  are likely rotating with a similar angular velocity , convective velocities in the secondary are slower , leading to convective flows that are more susceptible to the influence of the coriolis force . this could then drive strong magnetic fields that also quench the differential rotation .",
    "unfortunately , assessing the level of differential rotation on the secondary is not currently possible .",
    "@xcite predicts that when differential rotation is quenched , the large scale axisymmetric component of the magnetic field should account for a larger fraction of total magnetic energy . using the empirical scaling relations of @xcite",
    ", we estimated the large scale magnetic field component on each star using our derived x - ray luminosities .",
    "we find that the large scale component of the magnetic field ( taken to be perpendicular to the line of sight ) makes up 6% and 12% of the total magnetic energy , corresponding to @xmath264  g and 100  g for a and b , respectively . while the trend is consistent with the secondary having a more significant large scale field component ( in terms of total magnetic energy contribution ) , it is not possible to say whether this is the result of different dynamo actions .    in summary , while many critical aspects of the problem are still not understood , the arguments above seem to support a picture in which the models are able to match the measured temperatures and radii of the components with the magnetic field playing little role in changing the structure of the primary star ( i.e. , consistent with it having a rotational dynamo ) .",
    "the nature of the magnetic field on the secondary is less clear , with the observations perhaps favoring a distributed ( turbulent ) dynamo over a rotational one , but not at a very significant level .",
    "other consequences of magnetic fields on structure of the stars in  appear small : the predicted apsidal motion constant corresponds to an apsidal motion period of @xmath265 yr for a magnetic secondary ( both dynamo types ) , not very different from the value of @xmath266 yr computed with no magnetic fields .",
    "the observed value from sect .",
    "[ sec : ephemeris ] is unfortunately much too imprecise for a meaningful comparison .",
    "we note that the properties of the system are such that the contribution to the apsidal motion from general relativity effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is expected to dominate ( 72% ) over the classical terms from tidal and rotational distortion .",
    "a larger effect of magnetic fields is seen on the convective turnover time .",
    "the dartmouth models yield @xmath267 days for the primary star , somewhat longer than other estimates mentioned earlier , and values for the secondary of 50.5 days ( standard , non - magnetic ) , 49.3 days ( rotational dynamo ) , and 65.4 days ( turbulent dynamo ) .",
    "with masses and radii determined to better than 0.7% and 1.3% , respectively , and a secondary of spectral type m1 ,  joins the ranks of the small group of eclipsing binary systems containing at least one low - mass main - sequence star with well - measured properties .",
    "what distinguishes this example is that the chemical composition is well known from our detailed analysis of the disentangled spectrum of the primary component , which is an easily studied g1 star .",
    "investigations of most other systems containing m stars have struggled to infer metallicities directly from the molecule - ridden spectra of the m stars , or by more indirect means .",
    "knowledge of the metallicity removes a free parameter in the comparison with stellar evolution models that permits a more meaningful test of theory , as we have done here .",
    "we have also made a special effort to establish an accurate temperature for the primary star by measuring it in several different ways , as the @xmath31 value for the secondary hinges on it , as does the entire comparison with models .",
    "both the yonsei - yale and the dartmouth models provide a good match to the primary star at the measured metallicity , suggesting that both its temperature and metallicity are accurate . on the other hand , we find that standard models from the dartmouth series underpredict the radius and overpredict the temperature of the secondary by several percent , as has been found previously for many other cool main - sequence stars .",
    "magnetic models from the same series succeed in matching the observed radii and temperatures of both stars at their measured masses with surface magnetic fields for the secondary of about 12 kg in strength , fairly typical of early m dwarfs , and an age of some 3gyr .",
    "these field strengths are not far from what we estimate empirically for b on the basis of the rossby numbers .",
    "the agreement is reassuring , and suggests that we are closer to understanding radius inflation and temperature suppression for convective stars , not only qualitatively but also quantitatively .",
    "earlier quantitative evidence in this direction was presented by @xcite , also for the dartmouth models , with the present case being perhaps a stronger test in that our estimates of the individual magnetic field strengths used somewhat weaker assumptions .",
    "is thus a key benchmark system for this sort of test .",
    "questions remain , however , about the exact nature of the magnetic fields and how their effect on the global properties of the stars should be treated in the models ( rotational dynamo , turbulent dynamo , or some other prescription ) .",
