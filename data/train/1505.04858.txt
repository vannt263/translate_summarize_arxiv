    "neutrino oscillation experiments in the past two decades have revealed that neutrinos are actually massive particles and lepton flavors are significantly mixed  @xcite . in order to accommodate tiny neutrino masses , one can go beyond the minimal standard model ( sm ) and introduce three right - handed neutrinos @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 ) , which are singlets under the @xmath6 gauge group of the sm .",
    "the most general gauge - invariant lagrangian relevant for lepton masses and flavor mixing can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the left - handed lepton and higgs doublets , respectively , while @xmath10 the right - handed charged - lepton singlets .",
    "in addition , @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand respectively for the yukawa coupling matrices of charged leptons and neutrinos , and @xmath13 is the majorana mass matrix for right - handed neutrino singlets .",
    "after the higgs field acquires its vacuum expectation value @xmath14 and the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down , the charged - lepton mass matrix is given by @xmath15 , while the dirac neutrino mass matrix is @xmath16 .",
    "since the majorana mass term for right - handed neutrino singlets is not subject to the electroweak gauge symmetry breaking , the absolute scale of @xmath13 could be much higher than the electroweak energy scale @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , in the low - energy effective theory with heavy majorana neutrinos integrated out , the mass matrix of three light neutrinos is given by the famous seesaw formula @xmath18 .",
    "given @xmath19 , one can obtain neutrino masses at the sub - ev level if @xmath20 is close to the scale of grand unified theories @xmath21 . in this canonical seesaw model  @xcite",
    ", the lightness of ordinary neutrinos can be ascribed to the heaviness of right - handed majorana neutrinos . moreover , the mismatch between the diagonalization of @xmath22 and @xmath23 leads to lepton flavor mixing .    in the basis where both the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath24 and the mass matrix of heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath25 are diagonal ,",
    "the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton flavor mixing are determined by the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath26 , which can be diagonalized as @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain any predictions for the low - energy observables , one has to know the flavor structure of @xmath29 , which is completely unconstrained in the generic seesaw model . generally speaking",
    ", there are two different guiding principles towards seeking a solution to this problem , namely , flavor symmetry and minimality :    * in the first approach , discrete or continuous flavor symmetries are imposed on the generic lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : massterm ] ) , and all the sm fields are assigned into proper representations of the symmetry groups . due to the required symmetries , the yukawa coupling matrices are not arbitrary any more .",
    "it has been demonstrated that discrete flavor symmetries can be implemented to successfully predict interesting lepton flavor mixing patterns , which are well compatible with the latest neutrino oscillation data .",
    "for recent reviews on this topic , see refs .",
    "although this scenario is very attractive in the first place , it actually suffers from the involvement of many new scalar fields that are needed in order to achieve the desired flavor structures of yukawa coupling matrices . as a consequence , it is generally difficult to verify or disprove a flavor - symmetry model experimentally . * in the second approach , the number of model parameters is intentionally reduced to a level , beyond which the model would immediately run into contradictions with current experimental observations .",
    "the minimality of a model , in the sense of minimal number of free parameters , can be regarded as an occam s razor  @xcite .",
    "one practical way of reducing free parameters is to simply take some yukawa matrix elements to be zero .",
    "the physical essence of texture zeros actually reflects that some elements in a yukawa coupling matrix are highly suppressed when compared to the other elements , or they are irrelevant to fermion mass spectra and flavor mixing .",
    "for instance , the texture zeros turn out to be very useful to establish a relationship between small flavor mixing angles and strong mass hierarchy in the quark sector  @xcite . as shown by weinberg in ref .",
    "@xcite , the texture zeros in two - generation quark mass matrices lead to a successful prediction for the cabbibo angle @xmath30 , where the running mass of down quark @xmath31 and strange quark @xmath32 are evaluated at @xmath33  @xcite . in the same spirit ,",
    "more than ten years ago , frampton , glashow and yanagida proposed a minimal scenario of seesaw models , in which only two right - handed neutrinos are introduced and two elements of the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath29 are assumed to be vanishing  @xcite . in this case , @xmath29 becomes a @xmath34 matrix , and can be explicitly written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are in general complex .",
    "there are totally fifteen possible patterns of @xmath29 with two texture zeros in different positions , and we shall examine all of them in the following section .",
    "the number of texture zeros in @xmath29 can not be further increased , otherwise the model will be in conflict with three nonzero flavor mixing angles , as measured in neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the seesaw model with just one heavy right - handed neutrino does not work , since there will be two massless ordinary neutrinos that have already been excluded .",
    "hence , the scenario of two heavy right - handed neutrinos together with the frampton - glashow - yanagida ( fgy ) ansatz like that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : md ] ) is the minimal version of type - i seesaw model , which will be called the fgy model hereafter .",
    "one can immediately verify that neutrino mass spectrum and leptonic cp - violating phases are calculable from the observed three neutrino mixing angles and two neutrino mass - squared differences  @xcite , implying a complete testability of the model in future neutrino experiments .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that this minimal scenario emerges when one right - handed majornana neutrino is much heavier than the other two and decouples from the theory , or its yukawa couplings to lepton and higgs doublets are vanishingly small  @xcite .",
    "another salient feature of the canonical seesaw model is to account for the baryon number asymmetry in our universe via the leptogenesis mechanism  @xcite . in the early universe ,",
    "the temperature is high enough to thermally produce heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath40 .",
    "as the universe cools down , the out - of - equilibrium and cp - violating decays of @xmath40 generate lepton number asymmetries , which will further be converted into the baryon asymmetry via nonperturbative sphaleron processes  @xcite .",
    "excellent reviews on leptogenesis can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in light of recent progress in neutrino oscillation experiments ,",
    "we reconsider the fgy model and carry out a complete study with a focus on the currently unresolved problems , such as neutrino mass ordering , leptonic cp violation and the majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "the main motivation for such an investigation is two - fold .",
    "first , due to a minimal set of free parameters , the fgy model is quite predictive , so it is interesting to confront it with the latest global - fit results of neutrino oscillation data .",
    "a similar analysis has actually been done in ref .",
    "different from that work , we take into account the renormalization - group ( rg ) running effects of lepton flavor mixing parameters from the seesaw scale @xmath41 , usually characterized by the lightest heavy majorana neutrino mass @xmath42 , to the electroweak scale @xmath43 .",
    "second , in the previous work , a strong mass hierarchy @xmath44 is always assumed , and a narrow range of heavy neutrino masses @xmath45 is derived by requiring a successful leptogenesis mechanism to explain the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "but such a large mass scale in the theory causes the naturalness or fine - tuning problem on the one hand  @xcite , and the gravitino overproduction problem if the model is supersymmetrized on the other hand  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are motivated to go beyond the hierarchical limit , and consider both mild mass hierarchy and a nearly - degenerate mass spectrum of heavy majorana neutrinos . only with careful studies of rg running effects and",
    "general mass spectra of heavy majorana neutrinos can we really test the fgy model .",
    "the remaining part of our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "phenomenological implications of the fgy model are explored and confronted with current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we also consider the rg running effects of neutrino mixing parameters , and specify the allowed regions of the parameter space at the low - energy scale .",
    "only four out of fifteen patterns of the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrices are found to be compatible with neutrino oscillation data , and only the inverted neutrino mass ordering is allowed .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the generation of baryon number asymmetry via leptogenesis , where we also discuss the impact of lepton flavor effects and non - hierarchical mass spectrum of heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "the flavor structure of four viable patterns leads to a non - vanishing cp asymmetry in one specific lepton flavor .",
    "we point out that a nearly - degenerate mass spectrum of heavy majorana neutrinos is required to explain the baryon number asymmetry , and simultaneously avoid huge radiative corrections to the light higgs boson mass .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section 4 .",
    "we start with neutrino mass spectrum and flavor mixing parameters in the type - i seesaw model with only two right - handed heavy majorana neutrinos . after some general remarks",
    ", we proceed to introduce the fgy ansatz and explore its phenomenological implications .",
    "the rg evolution of neutrino masses and mixing parameters is considered when we confront the fgy ansatz with low - energy neutrino oscillation data .",
    "finally , the model parameters relevant for leptogenesis at the high - energy scale are determined .",
    "in the basis where both the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath22 and the heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath13 are diagonal , the diagonalization of the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath26 via @xmath46 gives us neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath47 and the pmns matrix @xmath28 .",
    "since only two right - handed neutrinos are introduced and their mass matrix @xmath48 is of rank two , it is straightforward to verify that the rank of effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath23 is two . as a consequence ,",
    "the lightest neutrino must be massless . in the case of normal mass ordering ( no ) with @xmath49",
    ", we get @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in the case of inverted mass ordering ( io ) with @xmath52",
    ", we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments in the case of no ( or io ) . at present , however , it is unclear whether neutrino mass ordering is no or io .",
    "the ongoing long - baseline accelerator experiments t2k  @xcite and no@xmath58a  @xcite , the forthcoming medium - baseline reactor experiments juno  @xcite and reno-50  @xcite , and the future huge atmospheric neutrino experiment pingu  @xcite will provide a definitive answer to this question .",
    "furthermore , the pmns matrix in this minimal model can be parametrized via three mixing angles @xmath59 , one dirac - type cp - violating phase @xmath60 and one majorana - type cp - violating phase @xmath61 , namely @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 have been defined for @xmath65 .",
    "while three mixing angles have been determined with reasonably good precision from oscillation experiments , there is still no significant evidence for a nontrivial dirac cp - violating phase . in table 1 ,",
    "the latest global - fit analysis of neutrino oscillation parameters has been presented .",
    "one can observe that the best - fit value of dirac cp - violating phase is @xmath66 for no and @xmath67 for io , but it becomes arbitrary at the @xmath68 level .",

    "the reason is simply that we use different boltzmann equations for the two cases of below and above @xmath279 .",
    "the kink should disappear if the fully quantum boltzmann equations with coherent flavor effects are used  @xcite .",
    "the curve is continuous around @xmath398 , since the flavor structure enforces only one nonzero cp asymmetry @xmath338 .",
    "in light of the latest neutrino oscillation data , we have performed a further study of the fgy model , in which only two right - handed heavy majorana neutrinos are introduced and two texture zeros appear in the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrix , by taking into account the rg running of neutrino mixing parameters and flavor effects in leptogenesis . such an investigation",
    "is well motivated in two aspects .",
    "first , the fgy model is very interesting and predictive , and can be readily confronted with the latest neutrino oscillation data . since the lightest neutrino is massless , the neutrino mass spectrum is fixed by the neutrino mass - squared differences , which are precisely measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "there are one dirac and one majorana cp - violating phases , which are actually determined by neutrino mixing angles and masses .",
    "the neutrino mass ordering is inverted , implying that the effective neutrino mass @xmath399 is well within the reach of next - generation neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments .",
    "second , either the renormalization - group running effects of neutrino mixing parameters or the lepton flavor effects in leptogenesis has been ignored in the previous studies .",
    "moreover , in order to stabilize the higgs boson mass , the lightest heavy majorana neutrino mass should be light enough @xmath352 , which contradicts with the requirement @xmath354 for a successful leptogenesis .",
    "it is interesting to revisit this economical model by considering rg running effects , lepton flavor effects in leptogenesis and a non - hierarchical mass spectrum of heavy majorana neutrinos .    in this work , taking account of the rg running effects on neutrino mixing parameters , we have consolidated the conclusions reached in ref .",
    "@xcite and demonstrated that only four patterns @xmath206 , @xmath201 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : caseb ] ) in the io case are allowed by current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "this generalization is important for the mssm with a large value of @xmath224 , where the rg running effects are significant .",
    "it has been found that the determination of neutrino mass ordering and the observation of neutrinoless double - beta decays will provide critical evidences to verify or disprove these four patterns .",
    "furthermore , the octant of @xmath204 and the cp - violating phase @xmath60 will be measured in future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments , and then can be used to further distinguish between @xmath206 ( or @xmath213 ) and @xmath201 ( or @xmath214 ) .",
    "if the baryon number asymmetry is interpreted via leptogenesis mechanism , the relative sign of low - energy cp violation ( i.e. , the jarlskog invariant @xmath400 ) to the high - energy cp violation ( i.e. , the cp asymmetry @xmath389 in @xmath286 decays ) serves as a discriminator for @xmath206 ( @xmath201 ) and @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "the most important formulas for four viable patterns are collected in table 2 . if the naturalness criterion is applied to the fgy model , only the nearly - degenerate mass spectrum of heavy majorana neutrinos with a mass degeneracy of @xmath401 is allowed , and resonant leptogenesis becomes responsible for the baryon number asymmetry .",
    "the fgy model actually exemplifies the idea of occam s razor , which cuts away unnecessary free parameters and renders the model to be most economical and testable .",
    "if one of four viable patterns of the flavor structure is singled out by future neutrino experiments , we should go further to identify the underlying symmetries and explore the true dynamics for neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing .",
