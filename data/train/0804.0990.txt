    "vanadium dioxide undergoes a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at the transition temperature @xmath3 k@xcite , and much work has been done both experimentally and theoretically to investigate the role of electron correlations in this transition .",
    "at high temperature vo@xmath0 is metallic and forms tetragonal rutile ( r ) structure with space group @xmath4 , while at low temperature vo@xmath0 forms monoclinic ( @xmath1 ) structure with space group @xmath5 , and becomes insulating with a band gap of @xmath6 ev @xcite .",
    "the striking feature of @xmath1 phase is the dimerization of vanadium atoms with the zigzag - like displacements , which leads to a doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath7 axis . in both phases the crystal field splits vanadium @xmath2 bands into a doubly degenerate @xmath8 band and a non - degenerate @xmath9 band .",
    "goodenough goodenough proposed a peierls ( band - like ) picture of the insulating state : in the metallic vo@xmath0 , the @xmath9 band overlaps with the @xmath8 band , and both bands are partially filled . in the insulating vo@xmath0 , the pairing of vanadium atoms leads to the bonding - antibonding splitting of two @xmath9 bands , which separates the ( bonding ) @xmath9 band and @xmath8 band .",
    "the bonding @xmath9 band becomes filled , while the @xmath8 band becomes empty , and the gap opens up between them .",

    "they failed to reproduce an insulating monoclinic vo@xmath0 , but they attributed this failure to the problem of the lda .",
    "however , since this peierls model can not explain the metastable insulating state of another monoclinic ( @xmath10 ) structure @xcite , where only half of vanadium atoms are dimerized , the importance of electron - electron correlations was emphasized @xcite . to study the effect of correlations beyond the lda , theoretical works using lda + dmft ( dynamical mean field theory @xcite )",

    "et al_. performed cluster - dmft calculations in this system and succeeded in reproducing the two phases @xcite . in their result for insulating vo@xmath0 the antibonding @xmath9 band is strongly renormalized to form the upper hubbard band due to correlation , but the peak of the spectral function just below the fermi energy is , interestingly , not an incoherent lower hubbard band but a quasiparticle peak of the @xmath9 band , which indicates insulating vo@xmath0 has also a band - like nature .",
    "the above dmft model approaches are parameter - dependent and only a few bands are taken into account .",
    "hence , a first - principles description without adjustable parameters is highly desirable . the gw approximation ( gwa ) @xcite has been successfully applied to calculations of excited state properties of a wide range of materials , thus the gwa may be appropriate for this problem",
    "however , due to a system size of vo@xmath0 ( monoclinic vo@xmath0 has 12 atoms in a unit cell ) , a direct application of the gw method to this system has been limited .",

    "compared to the lda result , the self - energy correction makes the _ d - p _ separation larger by about @xmath6 ev , but the bandwidth of the _ d _ bands does not show a significant change . we find that due to the dynamical correlation effects , at some k - points ( not seen in fig .  [",

    "noting that in the gw approximation the imaginary part of the self - energy is related to @xmath13 as @xcite @xmath53where @xmath54 is an arbitrary set of basis functions and the superscript @xmath7 signifies the correlation part , this peak structure is due to the corresponding peak in @xmath55 or equivalently @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the dielectric function .",
    "we actually find a strong peak in @xmath58 around @xmath46 ev , which may be interpreted as a sub - plasmon arising from strong transitions from the narrow @xmath9 band to empty states just above the fermi level .",
    "it is interesting to note that the peak in @xmath59 above the fermi level is much stronger than the peak below the fermi level .",
    "this difference in the strength of the peaks most likely originates from the matrix elements , as can be clearly seen in the above expression for @xmath59 .    in the metallic phase the orbital dependence of the self - energy for these @xmath2 orbitals is small , which reflects the weak orbital polarization in this phase .",
    "we also find that the self - energy shows some k - dependence ; for the x point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vo2rsigma](a)-(c ) ) and other k points that lies on the plane @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a reciprocal vector parallel to the @xmath7 axis , the self - energy shows similar , or `` isotropic '' behavior , while for the r point ( fig .",

    "close to the fermi energy there are sharp quasiparticle peaks , and the sub - plasmon - originated peak at around @xmath52 ev in the self - energy yields a weak satellite structure .",
    "the renormalization factor @xmath71 of @xmath2 bands is about @xmath72 , which indicates strong transfer of the spectra weight to the incoherent part . in the dmft calculation by liebsch _",
    "_ @xcite and the cluster dmft calculation by biermann _",
    "@xcite the satellite structure is found also below the quasiparticle peak at around @xmath73 ev , which is also observed in the recent photoemission spectra @xcite . that satellite , regarded as the lower hubbard band , is not seen in our calculation .    the self - energy of real systems differs from that of the hubbard model in the following fashions .",
    "the energy scale of the self - energy of the hubbard model is determined by @xmath74 , which is of the order of a few ev , whereas the energy scale of the self - energy of the real systems is determined by the bare coulomb interaction , which is typically one order of magnitude larger than the hubbard @xmath74 . as a result",
    ", @xmath59 of the hubbard model decays to zero after a few ev , above and below the fermi level , whereas @xmath59 of the real systems decays to zero at energies larger than the plasmon energy , which is of the order of tens of ev .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vo2rsigma ] the presence of high - energy plasmon excitation causes @xmath59 to increase to a large value outside the energy range of approximately -4 ev and 4 ev , in contrast to the hubbard model in which @xmath59 decays to zero outside this energy range .",
    "the decay of @xmath59 enhances the satellite structure and may actually overemphasize the strength of the satellite , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "nevertheless , experimentally there appears to be some evidence that there exists indeed a satellite structure a few ev below the fermi level @xcite . in order to reproduce that peak",
    ", one must include the short range correlation effect beyond rpa ; for this purpose it would be very interesting to apply methods such as gw+dmft biermann2 to this system .",
    "figure [ fig : vo2m1band ] shows the band structure of insulating monoclinic vo@xmath0 calculated within the lda and the gwa with only the diagonal part of the self - energy . as in the metallic phase we see the separation of the @xmath2 and @xmath47 bands due to the octahedral crystal field and the downward shift of o @xmath42 bands , but in this phase the occupied part of v @xmath75 states is mainly of @xmath9 character , which results from the pairing of the vanadium atoms . to evaluate the effect of the off - diagonal self - energy to the band structure , we compare the results with and without the off - diagonal self - energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : vo2m1band2 ] . in this calculation",
    "the matrix elements of the self - energy are calculated within the v @xmath76 subspace .",
    "we find that inclusion of the o @xmath42 bands changes the quasiparticle energies by less than @xmath77 ev . in most bands",
    "the off - diagonal self - energy is very small and the two results are almost the same , but a noticeable difference is found near the fermi energy . in the diagonal - only gw result ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vo2m1band2](b ) ) , an unusual band overlap around the a point is found , which is removed when the off - diagonal self - energy is included .",
    "this anomaly is attributed to the inefficiency of both the lda and 1-shot gw . around the a point the valence ( @xmath9 ) band and conduction ( @xmath8 ) band are barely separated in the lda level ( fig .",
    "fig : vo2m1band2(a ) ) , so these bands are fictitiously  hybridized .",
    "since the diagonal - only gw calculation does not change the character of wavefunctions , this hybridization can not be removed unless the off - diagonal self - energy is included .",
    "thus , the lda wavefunctions and the quasiparticle ones obtained by including the off - diagonal self - energy are far from identical .    at first sight",
    "the presence of bands crossing the fermi level at around the a point intuitively suggests that it is unlikely to open up a gap around that point . in the case of single band",
    "crossing the fermi level there appears to be no choice other than an opening of a mott gap .",
    "however , in the case of vo@xmath0 there are multi - bands , which still allow for an opening of a gap within a one - particle picture by means of rearrangement of the band occupation .",
    "this is indeed the case and it is noteworthy that the rearrangement of the band occupation around the a point is already obtained in the one - shot gw calculation , provided the off - diagonal self - energy is taken into account .",
    "we thus observe two important ingredients in gap opening in narrow band materials where entangled bands cross the fermi level : first , the off - diagonal self - energy is crucial in `` dehybridizing '' the bands and rearranging the band occupation , and second , the modification of the one - particle energies decreases the screening and hence enhances the gap opening @xcite in the course of self - consistency .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional semiconductors where the gap opening , in the case of overlapping valence and conduction bands , is simply affected by shifting the bands , i.e. , by the second mechanism .",
    "we also find that due to the non - linear behavior of the self - energy , it is crucial to take into account the frequency dependence of the self - energy explicitly in calculating @xmath78 . the results with and without the linearization are compared in fig .",
    "fig : vo2m1bandcompare .",
    "the usual linearized approach ( eq .  ( eq : linearizedegw ) ) , which is used in most 1-shot gw calculations , causes an error of as much as @xmath79 ev for the @xmath9 band , which leads to the underestimation of the valence band width and hence overestimation of the band gap .",
    "figure  [ fig : vo2m1sigma ] ( a - c ) shows the diagonal self - energy for the insulating phase at @xmath80 and e for three bands : bonding and antibonding @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the self - energy for other k - points shows similar behavior .",
    "a nonlinear behavior of the self - energy is clearly seen from the figure , which explains the failure of usual linearization scheme .",
    "owing to the lattice distortion , the self - energy for these @xmath2 bands shows strong orbital dependence , in contrast to the metallic phase ; peak structures in @xmath81 around @xmath82 ev and @xmath83 ev arising from strong transition from the narrow @xmath9 band to empty states just above the fermi level are more prominent for @xmath9 bands .",
    "this peak yields extra solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullqpeq ] ) , which are seen as flat bands around @xmath84 ev in fig .",
    "[ fig : vo2m1band ] .",
    "the renormalization factor for these bands is about @xmath85 .    in our 1-shot",
    "gw result , even if the off - diagonal self - energy is included there still exists a small indirect band overlap of @xmath86 ev in contrast to the experimental band gap of @xmath6 ev .",
    "furthermore , the bonding - antibonding splitting of @xmath9 bands is less than @xmath46 ev , noticeably smaller than experiment@xcite .",
    "the present calculation uses the lda wavefunctions and eigenenergies to construct @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the failure to reproduce the experimental gap may be due to the poorness of the starting states , and a calculation starting from a better mean - field solution will be needed to test the initial state dependence . indeed , very recently gatti _ et al _ attempted such a calculation @xcite .",
    "they first performed a static cohsex calculation self - consistently , and obtained an insulating phase .",
    "the result is used as the starting hamiltonian of a subsequent one - shot gw calculation , which yields a final band gap in good agreement with experiment .",
    "they found that without modification of the lda wave functions , the gap is not opened .",
    "since a self - consistent gw scheme @xcite is not yet well - established@xcite , it would be meaningful to study the effect of initial states @xcite and self - consistency .",
    "the problem is how to construct a one - particle hamiltonian whose eigenfunctions and energies well represent the quasiparticle wavefunctions and energies .",
    "one possible way is a so - called quasiparticle self - consistent scheme ( qsgw ) proposed in ref .  , where the exchange and correlation part of the one - particle hamiltonian is replaced by a static non - local exchange - correlation potential constructed using the following formula :    @xmath87   \\label{qsgw}\\ ] ]    with the self - energy @xmath11 calculated in the gwa .",
    "the reason for introducing such a recipe is that the self - energy is energy dependent . for the diagonal elements ( @xmath88 )",
    "no ambiguities arise in choosing the energy but for the off - diagonal elements the choice of the energy is ambiguous .",
    "the formula , however , still awaits theoretical justification .    as another choice",
    ", we propose the following procedure .",
    "the quasiparticle wavefunctions @xmath89 , obtained as solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qpeq ] ) with @xmath59 neglected , are in general not orthogonal and therefore unsuitable as an input for a gw calculation .",
    "we envisage that a natural and physically motivated quasiparticle hamiltonian is@xmath90which may be viewed as a series of quasiparticle modes ( qpm ) .",
    "this quasiparticle hamiltonian is evidently hermitian and ambiguities in choosing the energy in the self - energy do not arise .",
    "upon diagonalizing @xmath91 we obtain an orthonormal set of wavefunctions with the corresponding eigenvalues . in most cases the quasiparticle wavefunctions",
    "are almost orthogonal , thus the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ hqp ] ) should be very close to the original quasiparticle states .    to convince ourselves that our qpm approximation is physically sound , we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpaandb ] the quasiparticle band structures generated from the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullqpeq ] ) and the qpm approximation ( eq .  ( [ hqp ] ) ) as well as the qsgw ( eq .  ( [ qsgw ] ) ) . in this calculation , the self - energy @xmath11 is calculated with lda eigenstates ( i.e. , non - self - consistent calculation ) .",
    "as can be seen the qpm band structure agree with the true quasiparticle band structure well within the accuracy of the calculations whereas the band structure calculated using eq .",
    "( [ qsgw ] ) shows a noticeable deviation from the true quasiparticle band structure around the a point .",
    "this deviation originates from the approximated form of the off - diagonal part of the effective exchange - correlation potential .",
    "thus , the quasiparticle energy can be sensitive to the choice of the energy in the self - energy .",
    "on the other hand , the qpm approximation is free from ambiguity in choosing the energy argument in the self - energy and the off - diagonal self - energy is properly taken into account implicitly via the quasiparticle wavefunction ( eq .  ( [ hqp ] ) ) .",
    "a self - consistent scheme is now at our disposal .",
    "we start by performing a gw calculation using the lda band structure as an input .",
    "the resulting self - energy is then used to construct the quasiparticle wavefunctions and energies by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullqpeq ] ) .",
    "a new set of wavefunctions and energies are obtained within the qpm approximation in eq .",
    "( [ hqp ] ) and used to perform the next gw calculation .",
    "the iteration continues until the quasiparticle wavefunctions and energies converge . for the case of vo@xmath0 that we are considering ,",
    "this is a very cumbersome task due to the large system size .",
    "we have observed , however , the following result : starting from the metallic lda band structure , the quasiparticle band structure obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullqpeq ] ) acquires a ( direct ) gap already in the first iteration .",
    "the self - energy is assumed to be diagonal except within the v @xmath76 subspace .",
    "it is important to note that the gap around the a point is not opened up if the off - diagonal elements of the self - energy within the t@xmath92 subspace are not taken into account .",
    "this suggests that the rearrangement of the wavefunctions already takes place in the first iteration and after the first iteration we may then keep the same wavefunctions .",
    "thus in the subsequent iterations we simulate the self - consistency by uniformly shifting the conduction band quasiparticle energies as @xmath93 .",
    "we tested this simplified self - consistent scheme for simple semiconductors and found that it yields a result very close to that of the full qpm self - consistent calculation . in the calculation of vo@xmath0 , we start the calculation from the gapped state by adding an initial shift to the lda conduction levels .",
    "this process is necessary to better simulate the insulating state in constructing the self - energy matrix .",
    "we performed the calculations with several values for the initial shift , and found that the final result is not sensitive to the value of the initial shift .",
    "the result of the gaps as a function of the shift is shown in fig .",
    "fig : gapscissors .",
    "two indirect gaps are shown , one between points b and c and the other between d and c. the gw gaps increase almost linearly with the shift , and a self - consistent value of @xmath6 ev is found within the qpm approximation .",
    "this result differs considerably from the result obtained by assuming that the self - energy is diagonal , i.e. , the wavefunctions are given by those of the lda .",
    "our results show that the gwa within the quasiparticle concept is sensitive to the treatment of the off - diagonal elements of the self - energy , which modify the lda wavefunctions .",
    "although a proper definition of effective quasiparticle hamiltonian is debatable @xcite , the obtained @xmath6 ev gap in our calculation , which happens to be in good agreement with the experimental value , is an indication that our qpm scheme could furnish a suitable way of constructing a quasiparticle hamiltonian .",
    "our result makes us reconsider the electronic state of the paramagnetic insulating vo@xmath0 ; in peierls description , the bonding - antibonding separation of @xmath9 bands is determined only by the hybridization between two @xmath9 bands , and both spin up and down states are assumed to occupy the same ( bonding @xmath9 ) orbitals .",
    "however , the coulomb interaction between localized @xmath76 electrons invalidates this interpretation , as is clear from an example of 2-site hubbard model .",
    "thus , the paramagnetic insulating vo@xmath0 may be the result of a singlet state formed by two localized electrons on paired vanadium atoms , which can not be described in the mean - field theory .",
    "this is indeed the conclusion drawn from the work of biermann _ et al _ @xcite , who performed cluster lda+dmft calculations taking the vanadium dimer as a unit .",
    "however , our result along with previous calculations @xcite suggest that a one - particle description can still go a long way in describing the electronic structure of vo@xmath0 , at least in describing the insulating gap .",
    "nevertheless , we think that the peierls picture alone may not be sufficient for a complete description of the electronic structure of the insulating vo@xmath0 .",
    "the missing satellites below the fermi level , observed in photoemission experiment , is one such indication .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the self - energy and band structure of the metallic and insulating phases of vo@xmath0 within the gwa . in agreement with the work of gatti _ et al _ , we have found that the gwa is able to describe the metal - insulator transition .",
    "our calculations indicate that the band gap depends sensitively on the approximation used for the off - diagonal elements of the self - energy .",
    "thus , a proper way of defining the off - diagonal elements of the self - energy is crucial . using the qpm approximation and the scissor operator we have performed a self - consistent calculation to determine the band gap , which is found to be 0.6 ev , in agreement with calculated value by gatti _",
    "et al _ albeit using different methods .",
    "our results within the qpm approximation suggests that the gwa can treat correlation effects in vo@xmath0 and the opening of the gap supports the peierls picture of wentzcovitch _",
    "et al_. it does not seem to be necessary to perform calculations with broken spin symmetry ( antiferromagnetic structure ) as commonly done in order to open up a gap @xcite .    in both the metallic and insulating phases a satellite feature exists above the fermi energy but not below , in contrast to the spectra calculated within the lda+dmft scheme .",
    "since the experimental photoemission spectrum displays satellite features above and below the fermi level , usually interpreted as the upper and lower hubbard bands , we attribute the discrepancy of the gw spectra to vertex corrections , i.e. , correlations beyond the rpa , which are apparently captured in the lda+dmft .",
    "we have also found that the common procedure of calculating the quasiparticle energy by linearization of the self - energy failed badly in the case of vo@xmath0 .",
    "it would seem that for narrow band materials it is important to take into account the full energy dependence of the self - energy when calculating the quasiparticle energy .",
