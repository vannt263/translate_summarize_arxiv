    "the vulcanization transition ( vt ) is an equilibrium phase transition from a liquid state of matter to an amorphous solid state .",
    "it occurs when a sufficient number of permanent random constraints ( e.g.  chemical crosslinks)the quenched randomness ",
    "are introduced to connect the constituents ( e.g.  macromolecules ) whose locations are the thermally fluctuating variables .",
    "a rather detailed description of the vt has emerged over the past few years , ranging from a mean - field theory of the emerging amorphous solid state  @xcite to the critical properties of the vt itself  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the properties of correlators that solely involve the local monomer density , and to examine the extent to which such correlators provide access to informative signatures of the vt and the emergent amorphous solid state . along the way",
    ", we shall explore the relationship of these density correlators to various experimental probes , and also discuss their relationship to the diagnostics of non - ergodic media  studied by pusey , van megen and collaborators in their work on amorphous states of colloidal and gel systems  @xcite .",
    "we note that density correlators closely related to the ones we shall be considering also feature in certain recent approaches to structural glasses  @xcite , and we shall touch upon the relationship between our results and those of these recent approaches .",
    "apart from their connections with related studies by other researchers , we are motivated to explore the properties of density correlators in the context of the vt for the following reason . from the theoretical perspective , the natural collective",
    "coordinate from which to view the vt is _ not _ the local density ; rather it is the amorphous solid order parameter , which becomes nonzero as the amorphous solid state is entered and whose correlator - decay properties directly mark the onset of amorphous solidification . however , as we shall discuss further below , from the perspective of experiment , the amorphous solid order parameter is rather more elusive than one would like , the most direct way to measure it being via incoherent quasi - elastic neutron scattering , whereas probes that couple to the density are more plentiful . for this reason , we wish to examine density correlators in the vicinity of the vt , and the extent to which they can provide access to both the structure of the amorphous solid state and the long - ranged amorphous solid order - parameter correlations that develop near the vt .    the approach that we shall adopt to study these density correlators is based upon a minimal model that takes into account the integrity of the macromolecules , their thermal position - fluctuations , the short - range repulsion of the constituent monomers , and the permanent random constraints imposed by crosslinking . this minimal model has previously been shown to give an accurate picture of the universal properties of the vt , in the sense that its predictions for the mean - field properties of the amorphous solid state have been verified in the computer simulations of barsky and plischke  @xcite , and those of its critical properties that have been elucidated so far ( i.e.  the percolative aspects ) are in accordance with the predictions of percolation and related field - theoretic approaches  @xcite . in order for our discussion to be concrete and physical",
    ", we shall adopt language specific to randomly crosslinked macromolecular systems(rcmss ) , although our results apply to a broader class of systems .",
    "let us now turn to the issue of the order parameter for the vt .",
    "this order parameter is crafted to detect and diagnose amorphous solidification ; it is the following function of @xmath0 wavevectors @xmath1 : @xmath2 ,   \\label{eq : opdefinition}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the total number of macromolecules , @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) is the position in @xmath7-dimensional space of the monomer at fractional arclength @xmath8 along the @xmath9 macromolecule , @xmath10 denotes a thermal average for a particular realization @xmath11 of the quenched disorder ( i.e.  the crosslinking ) , and @xmath12 $ ] represents a suitable averaging over realizations of the quenched disorder . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , this order parameter does indeed detect and diagnose the amorphous solid state .",
    "why is the amorphous solid order parameter measurable in neutron scattering experiments ? in quasi - elastic neutron scattering the _ incoherent _ contribution of the scattering cross - section is proportional to _",
    "j=1^n_0 ^ 1ds ( i*q*_j(s,0 ) ) ( -i*q*_j(s , t ) ) _ , where @xmath13 is the position of the monomer at time @xmath14 , the @xmath15 limit of the correlator being proportional ( up to disorder averaging ) to a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : opdefinition ] ) , viz . , _ 0 ^ 1ds i*q*_j(s ) _ -i*q*_j(s)_. on the other hand , in several other experimental techniques , such as those discussed below , it is some form of correlator involving the local monomer density ( * r*,t)_j=1^n_0 ^ 1ds ( * r*-*c*_j(s , t))that is probed .",
    "one frequently - measured correlator is the auto - correlation function of the local density @xmath16 , or equivalently @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fourier transform of @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "for example , in neutron scattering experiments this quantity is proportional to the _ coherent _ part of the quasi - elastic neutron scattering cross - section ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , sec .",
    "iiie ) , and in dynamical light scattering experiments , such as those performed on non - ergodic  media by pusey and van megen  @xcite , this quantity is proportional to the intermediate scattering function ( also known as the dynamical structure factor ) @xmath21 .",
    "( the average over quenched disorder @xmath22 $ ] in the present work essentially plays the role of the ensemble average @xmath23 of refs .  @xcite . )   the present theoretical framework is a static equilibrium framework and , as such , is not suitable for computing dynamical correlators .",
    "however , by using the cluster property ( i.e.  the fact that the connected correlators vanish for @xmath15 ) we see that the long - time limit of the density - density auto - correlation function is built from the equilibrium entity @xmath24 or , equivalently , its fourier transform @xmath25 , an entity that is calculable ( up to disorder averaging ) within our static equilibrium framework .",
    "in fact , our approach to the vt is capable of calculating precisely this kind of quantity and , therefore , of providing contact with experiments .    as our results for density correlators are relatively straightforward , we first report the results , deferring the construction and operation of the necessary theoretical machinery to subsequent sections .",
    "specifically , we find that : ( i )  the usual ( i.e.  disorder - averaged ) density - density correlator @xmath26 $ ] is insensitive to the vt , depending only analytically on the constraint density , both at the level of mean - field theory and beyond ( i.e.  to one - loop order ) .",
    "( ii )  the density - density correlator involving two thermal averages , @xmath27 $ ] , is zero in the liquid phase but becomes nonzero , continuously , as the system enters the amorphous solid phase .",
    "this behavior is a manifestation of the freezing - in of random density fluctuations , which is the hallmark of the amorphous solid state .",
    "this correlator turns out to be proportional the order parameter ( at least for weak coupling between the density and the order parameter fluctuations ) .",
    "as the order parameter encodes the fraction of localized particles and the distribution of localization lengths , this result indicates that these physical diagnostics are accessible via this density - density correlator .",
    "( iii )  the four - density correlator involving two thermal averages , @xmath28 $ ] , which can be realized as @xmath29 $ ] , becomes long - ranged as the vt is approached from the liquid side .",
    "we exhibit this phenomenon at the level of mean - field theory .",
    "( iv )  the two density - chanel signatures of the vt given in ( ii ) and ( iii ) also provide a means for identifying certain critical exponents at the vt , such as the gel - fraction exponent @xmath30 , and the correlation - length exponent @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , these density signatures provide another avenue for accessing experimentally the critical exponents of the vt .",
    "we approach the vt by adopting the spirit of the landau - wilson scheme for continuous phase transitions . to handle the presence of the random constraints we invoke the replica trick and adopt the deam and edwards model  @xcite for the statistics of the quenched randomness ( viz .  that the statistics of the random constraints are determined by the instantaneous correlations of the unconstrained system )",
    "thus , we are led to the need to work with the @xmath32 limit of systems of @xmath33 replicas .",

    "the basic mechanism at work is that the order parameter field , which is capable of ordering spontaneously , couples to the density fluctuations via a cubic vertex that is replica - off - diagonal as far as the density fields are concerned .",

    "deeper into the amorphous solid state , the order parameter @xmath77 does not decay so rapidly with @xmath94 and hence the quantity @xmath95 $ ] should remain appreciable ( and thus experimentally accessible ) over a wider range of @xmath94 .",
    "now , we expect eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrresults ] ) to remain valid , provided the coupling @xmath81 is small and both the wavevector dependence of @xmath81 and the finer wavevector dependence of  bare correlator are incorporated .",

    "we have studied density - sector correlators that furnish analogs of the two principal order - parameter signatures of the vt : the off - diagonal density correlator @xmath101 $ ] , which becomes nonzero as the amorphous solid state is entered ; and the four - field density correlator @xmath98 $ ] , which becomes long - ranged at the vt .",
    "we have shown that these density correlators provide useful information about both the emergent amorphous solid state and the critical properties of the transition itself .",
    "they provide schemes for accessing experimentally the kinds of quantities that have been found useful in theoretical investigations of the liquid , critical and amorphous solid states , e.g. , of vulcanized matter .",
    "we are not aware of any explorations of such signatures in the density correlators via percolation / gelation approaches to the vt .",
    "although , as we have seen , the off - diagonal density correlator @xmath27 $ ] is closely related to the order parameter of the vt , its non - zero value being induced by a non - zero order parameter , the off - diagonal density correlator can be used to diagnose a more general class of systems . by looking at the microscopic definition of the order parameter for the vt , eq .",
    "( [ eq : opdefinition ] ) ( especially for the special case in which only two thermal averages are involved ) , we see that it involves only a _",
    "summation over monomers and , therefore , the order parameter can not be expressed in terms of local monomer densities .",
    "in essence , the order parameter signals the amorphous solid phase via its detection of all individual monomers that are localized ( and , owing to the explicit crosslinks , distinguishable ) . on the other hand , the off - diagonal density correlator @xmath27 $ ] signals the amorphous solid state via the detection of the frozen structure of the local density fluctuations . in rcmss",
    ", the localization of monomers invariably induces the freezing of this structure , so these two quantities are equivalent .",
    "however in systems such as glasses , the ( local density ) structure is , presumably , frozen but each individual particle is able to wander throughout the system , given enough time , and therefore all particles retain their indistinguishability  @xcite .",
    "a quantity essentially identical to the off - diagonal correlator considered here has been employed by mezard and parisi  @xcite in the context of their theoretical approach to glassy systems .",
    "a similar quantity is employed in the diagnosis of the freezing - in of structure in colloidal glassy systems and gel systems in the dynamical light scattering experiments of pusey and van megen and collaborators  @xcite    vulcanized matter certainly differs from glassy systems , inasmuch as it possesses explicit quenched disorder in the form of permanent random crosslinks .",
    "because of this , it affords a framework in which the off - diagonal density correlator and other density correlators are directly calculable in a well controlled way , both near the transition and in the amorphous solid state . despite the difference with glassy systems , we hope that results such as those presented here in the setting of vulcanized matter will not only be useful but also shed some light on the more difficult problem of glassy systems .",
