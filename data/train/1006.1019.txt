    "internet advertising has become a main source of revenue for primary search engines nowadays .",
    "according to the newly - released report by interactive advertising bureau and pricewaterhousecoopers @xcite , internet advertising in the united states reached $ 22.7 billion in total revenue for the full year of 2009 , where sponsored search revenue accounted for 47 percent of the total revenue .",
    "a typical internet search market consists of three parties : _ publishers _ ( i.e. , search engines ) , _ advertisers _ and _ end users_. in the current age of information explosion , more and more people rely on search engines to pin down their favored products or services . whenever a query is submitted to the engines by end users , their _ intents _ or _ interests _ can be potentially captured by the engines through the inputted keywords .",
    "these intents of search users can then be sold by search engines to companies who are interested in targeting their products to these users . nowadays , major search engine operators like google , yahoo ! and microsoft display advertisements in the form of sponsored links , which appears alongside the algorithmic links ( also known as organic links ) in the search results pages . for each keyword , there are usually more than one available advertising slot in the search engine results page . how to effectively allocate these slots and charge the advertisers have been studied and discussed extensively in recent years among people in both academia and industry .",
    "take google s adwords program for example . in this advertising program , advertisers could choose multiple keywords they are interested in , and for each keyword indicate the maximal willingness to pay for each click and the budget to spend over a period of time . whenever a user clicks on the sponsored link and",
    "is re - directed to the advertisers site , certain payment is charged by the program until the advertisers budget is used up .",
    "most of the existing works focus on the interaction of the three parties within the scope of only _",
    "one _ search engine s advertising system , and these results and suggestions from researchers did greatly improve the efficiency of mechanism held in major search engine companies .",
    "for example , the transition from generalized first price auction to generalized second price auction , from payment per impression to payment per click , from bid - based ranking to quality - based ranking and so on @xcite .",
    "however , considering there is usually more than one company providing search service in the market , one natural question would be how the market would evolve when there exists competition between _ multiple _ search engines .",
    "in particular , will all users and advertisers gradually concentrate to one leading engine or will the `` inferior '' engines still earn enough profits to survive when competing with the leading one ? what would be the consequences if one search engine monopolizes the market ? should governments take anti - trust action against potential cooperation among major search engines ? these concerns arise from the current situation of high levels of concentration in search engine market : google is widely considered to possess the leading technology and obtain the largest market shares in most countries and regions , followed by yahoo ! and microsoft bing .",
    "this paper aims to formulate a reasonable model to study the competition between two search engine operators and help to address some of the intriguing questions mentioned above .",
    "we will consider a three - stage dynamic game model . in stage",
    "i , the two operators services determine how the market of end users is split . in stage",
    "ii , the two operators simultaneously determine their prices to advertisers . in stage iii",
    ", the advertisers choose the operator in which they can obtain highest utility based on the announced prices in stage ii .",
    "each operator wants to maximize its revenue subject to the competition for advertisers from the other operator .",
    "the key contributions of the paper are :    * to the best of our knowledge , this paper is among the first to model the _ comprehensive _ interaction of _ heterogenous _ publishers , advertisers and users in a _ competitive _ environment .",
    "we elaborate the whole process of search engine competition in attracting both users and advertisers .",
    "the technical details applied in practical advertising systems , such as the values and budgets of advertisers , are taken into consideration explicitly in our formulation .",
    "* we prove the existence of nash equilibrium prices when allowing advertisers participate in both advertising systems simultaneously .",
    "moreover , we show the comparative results between the equilibrium prices and monopoly price when only one search engine exists in the market .",
    "* we propose two distinct points of view , i.e. , the _ ex ante _ view and the _ ex post _ view , to inspect the _ long - term _ and _ short - term _ revenues of search engines respectively .",
    "furthermore , for the ex post case , we present the detailed algorithm for calculating the exact allocation results for advertisers . for the ex ante case",
    ", we can carry out the simulations to illustrate the comparative results of expected revenues and social welfare under competition and monopoly respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:2:related_work ] presents the related work .",
    "section [ sec:3:mono_model ] formulates the monopoly model and provides solutions for both the ex ante and ex post cases .",
    "based on the monopoly formulation , we analyze the strategic behaviors of end users and advertisers under duopoly and find the nash equilibrium prices of both search engines in section [ sec:4:duo_model ] . in section [ sec:5:simul ]",
    "we compare the results under competition and monopoly via simulation and reveal various factors that affect the revenues and social welfare .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec:6:conclu ] and outline some future research directions .",
    "there are mainly two lines of research work in the sponsored search area .",
    "the mainstream of literature focuses on the interaction between advertisers and search engines and aims to understand and devise viable mechanism for the internet advertising market .",
    "there is significant work on the auction mechanism held by major search engines , starting from two seminal works of @xcite and @xcite which independently investigated the `` generalized second - price '' ( gsp ) auction prevailing in major search engines such as google and yahoo!. in @xcite the authors compared the `` direct ranking '' method by overture with the `` revenue ranking '' method by google and proposed a _ truthful _",
    "mechanism named as `` laddered auction '' . considering the non - strategyproofness property of gsp mechanism",
    ", @xcite analyzed one prevalent strategy of advertisers called `` vindictive bidding '' in real - world keyword auction .",
    "@xcite and @xcite relaxed the basic assumption of separable click - through rate in @xcite and modeled the _ externality effect _ among advertisements which appeared in the same search page simultaneously .",
    "@xcite proposed a new valuation model to absorb the adverse effect of the competing advertisements on the advertiser s value per click .",
    "there is also an abundance of works on proposing more _ expressive _ but still _ scalable _ mechanism for sponsored search such as @xcite . in particular , in @xcite the advertisers were allowed to submit a two - dimensional bid @xmath0 where @xmath1 was the bid for exclusive display and @xmath2 for sharing slots with other advertisements . in @xcite the authors proposed a _ truthful _",
    "hybrid auctions where advertisers can make a per - impression as well as per - click bid and showed that it can generate higher revenue for search engine compared with the pure per - click scheme .",
    "it s worth pointing out that a few works considered the practical situation where similar keyword auctions are held simultaneously by _ multiple _ search engines .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors investigated the revenue properties of two search engines with different click - through rates which competed for the same set of advertisers .",
    "the study in @xcite considered competition between two search engines which differs in their ranking rules : one applied the direct ranking method we mentioned above , and the other applied the revenue ranking method .",
    "we assert that this assumption of search engine difference is unrealistic since major engines tend to use the same policy which proves to work efficiently in practice and it is unlikely that certain engine would switch back to the obsolete rules .",
    "the nash equilibrium solution in the former paper of @xcite is also not so practical since it requires advertisers to adopt certain randomized strategy .",
    "it s very difficult for individual advertisers to implement such complex strategies which would incur unnecessary maintenance cost .",
    "the other line of work is developed mainly by economists to address the broad issues of search engine competition from social welfare perspective .",
    "@xcite introduced a quality choice game model where end users choose the search engine with highest quality of search results , and showed that no nash equilibrium exists in this game . based on this proposition",
    ", the author argues that the search engine market would evolve towards monopoly in the absence of necessary regulatory interventions .",
    "@xcite proposed a duopoly model which has some similarity to our formulation , however , as many of the technical details of the practical advertising system are ignored , it is doubtful whether this can serve as an accurate model to predict the outcome of search engine market .",
    "similarly , @xcite faces the same problem that the vague description of participants utility may not be strong enough to support the predictive conclusions in the paper .",
    "these two lines of important work have little intersections so far : the mainstream of work concentrates on the technical progress in designing `` better '' advertising system , and the other line usually involves less technical details ( like the budgets of advertisers in practical advertising system ) and targets the macro - effect of competitive market . in view of this , we believe that a _ comprehensive _ study of the current search engine ecosystem in a _ competitive _ way is vital for addressing many of the unresolved issues in this thriving market .",
    "our work manages to narrow the gap between these two directions of research and makes some initial progress in this direction .",
    "this observation helps differentiate our work from most of the existing literature .",
    "in this section we consider the monopoly market first , which serves as a starting point for analyzing the more general competition market .",
    "suppose there is only one search engine in the market servicing a fixed set of end users and providing advertising opportunity for a set of advertisers denoted by @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "assuming all users are homogeneous and each of them tends to generate the same number of impressions ( or clicks ) for a particular keyword ( query ) .",
    "since we assumes that the search engine owns a fixed number of users , it would be able to supply a fixed number of attentions ( in the form of impressions or clicks ) for advertisers .",
    "for a given interval , let the supply of attentions be @xmath5 .",
    "each advertiser @xmath6 has two private parameters : _ value _",
    "@xmath7 denoting @xmath8 s maximal willingness to pay for each attention and _ budget _ @xmath9 in a given time interval ( could be daily , weekly , monthly budget and so on ) . the search engine needs to determine the optimal price per attention to maximize its revenue : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the demand function over price @xmath12 .    in the following analysis we consider this revenue maximization problem in two different perspectives : the _ ex ante _ perspective where the search engine only has an rough estimation to the parameters of participating advertisers , and the _ ex post _ perspective where the engine just needs to make decision based on the _ submitted _ parameters of advertisers .",
    "although in practice , the advertising systems do determine the prices only _ after _ advertisers have submitted their values and budgets , we assert that the ex ante view of revenue to be a natural fit for the search engine s objective .",
    "this is because typically the interaction between search engine and advertisers is not one - shot and would usually last for many rounds .",
    "advertisers can actually adjust their submitted parameters at any time to achieve better payoff .",
    "thus the ex ante result could provide valuable prediction of the _ long - term _ revenue for the search engine , rather than the _ short - term _ profit from one particular instance of the ex post case .      assuming the search engine can have a rough estimation of the distribution of advertisers values and budgets .",
    "for simplicity , we only consider the scenario when the parameters are independent and identically - distributed random variables . to be specific , suppose values are drawn independently from distribution with density function @xmath13 and cdf @xmath14 over the range of @xmath15 $ ] , and",
    "budgets are drawn independently from distribution with density function @xmath16 and cdf @xmath17 .",
    "after search engine announce the uniform price @xmath12 , advertiser @xmath8 would make the deal if only the value @xmath7 is larger than @xmath12 .",
    "the quantity advertiser @xmath8 could purchase is constrained by the budget @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the expected aggregate demand under price @xmath12 from all advertisers would be : @xmath18\\ ] ] rewrite it as : @xmath19\\ ] ] which is a non - increasing function over @xmath12 .",
    "we can use figure [ se_profit_over_price_exante ] to illustrate the revenue of search engine over price @xmath12 .",
    "+    [ demandequalsupply ] the revenue @xmath20 is maximized when @xmath21 , i.e. , when the demand equals the supply .",
    "proposition [ demandequalsupply ] can be proved by contradiction .",
    "if supply exceeds demand under the current price , the search engine will cut down the price to achieve higher revenue ( since @xmath22 is non - increasing over price @xmath12 ) ; if demand exceeds supply , the search engine can raise the price and reach a higher revenue ( since @xmath23 is monotonically increasing over price @xmath12 ) .    assuming @xmath7",
    "is drawn from uniform distribution with positive support on the interval @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ". then @xmath27 . from @xmath21",
    "we have :    @xmath28    the intuition is that the more demand ( larger @xmath29 ) there is , the higher market clearing price would be ; and the more supply ( larger @xmath5 ) there is , the lower market clearing price is .      in practical search engine advertising system",
    ", advertisers need to submit their values and budgets to the advertising system .",
    "the search engine therefore could determine the optimal price based on the ex post variables .",
    "reorder the index of advertisers such that @xmath30 .",
    "then the aggregate demand can be written as : @xmath31 where we define the set : @xmath32 thus @xmath33 is a non - increasing function over @xmath12 since @xmath34 shrinks as price @xmath12 increases . by letting demand equal to supply , we have @xmath35    notice that the term of price appears in both sides of the equation .",
    "thus in general we can not derive the closed - form solution for optimal price . since @xmath36 is piece - wise constant and ( weakly ) decreasing over @xmath12",
    ", we can illustrate the search engine revenue through examples in figure [ fig : se_profit_over_price_expost ] . here",
    "we assume there are four advertisers ordered such that @xmath37 and initially when the price is zero , @xmath38 .",
    "as the price exceeds @xmath39 , advertiser @xmath40 would have no incentive to stay and @xmath34 becomes @xmath41 .",
    "the crossing point of demand and supply shows that the optimal price @xmath42 is located in @xmath43 $ ] . to be more exact , @xmath44 . in figure [ se_profit_over_price_2_expost ]",
    "we also show the other case when there is one advertiser who is indifferent between participating and quitting the ad campaign since the optimal price is equal to its value . in typical search engine systems like google adwords ,",
    "after advertisers input their maximal willingness to pay ( i.e. , their values ) and budgets , the ad system would automatically allocate attentions to advertisers as long as the current price does nt exceed their values and the budgets have not been exhausted yet .",
    "thus here for ease of expression we can assume that the indifferent advertiser would continue participating in the ad campaign under the budget constraint .",
    "for example , as shown in figure [ se_profit_over_price_2_expost ] , the optimal price is equal to @xmath45 ( satisfying @xmath46 ) , advertiser 2 would consume the remaining supply of @xmath47 and only spent @xmath48 which is less than its budget @xmath49 .",
    "we can now show a polynomial step algorithm for search engine to compute the optimal price . by inputting the parameters of advertisers ( assuming",
    "the indexes of advertisers are re - ordered such that @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , algorithm [ alg : calculate_opt_price ] would return the value of optimal price .",
    "the time complexity of the algorithm is @xmath52 where @xmath29 is the number of advertisers by computing and saving the value of @xmath53 , @xmath54 first , which can be finished in @xmath55 steps .",
    "then the inner `` for '' loop in algorithm [ alg : calculate_opt_price ] can be substituted by the stored value of @xmath56 and the complexity of the algorithm is reduced to @xmath55 . here for simplicity of exposition , we just show the @xmath52 algorithm . ] .",

    "this can be summarized in algorithm [ alg : calculate_alloc_of_supply ] .",

    "_ prices _ : we would like to compare the equilibrium prices of both engines with the monopoly price if there is only one search engine dominates the market . in the following section we denote @xmath207 as the duopoly prices and @xmath395 as the monopoly price .",
    "revenues _ : it would be intriguing to study the comparative results of total revenues under competition and monopoly .",
    "the gap between revenues under competition and monopoly would serve as a signal of whether the leading company would like to propose a merger or acquisition to its competitor .",
    "a huge gap would infer that reaching certain cooperation agreement between the two competitors would significantly promote the revenues for both companies .",
    "_ aggregate utility of advertisers _ : we compare the aggregate utility of advertisers to see whether monopoly would be detrimental to the interest of advertisers , and if so , how severe the loss would be .",
    "in particular , we examine the aggregate utility for brand advertisers who benefits from the relatively lower price of the inferior search engine in the duopoly market .",
    "social welfare _ : social welfare can be regarded as the _ realized _ value of advertisers and is the benchmark for addressing the interest of the community as a whole . under competition ,",
    "the social welfare is computed according to the following equation : @xmath396 where @xmath67 is amount of supply allocated to advertiser @xmath8 .    in the following ,",
    "we carry out a set of simulation to investigate the comparative results under different parameter settings . for each simulation setting , we randomly generate 5000 instances of parameters and calculate the average value of each criterion .",
    "the expected values from _ ex ante _ perspective can then be approximated by the average values of large amounts of _ ex post _ instances .    * ( 1 ) .",
    "baseline setting : *    we consider two search engines equally dividing the market and the total supply is normalized to unity .",
    "thus the supply of either search engine is @xmath371 .",

    "we can make the following observations from figure [ simu : fig1](a)-(d ) :    1 .",
    "as the number of advertisers increases , the prices , revenues and social welfare would all get raised except the aggregate utility of advertisers .",
    "this is because as more advertisers participate , the demand for the limited supply would get boosted , which would finally drive up the unit price per supply and raise the revenue of search engines . as the price rises , the utility of advertisers would keep decreasing as seen in figure [ simu : fig1](c ) . the social welfare can still be improved since when more advertisers appears , only those advertisers with higher values can stay and be allocated with certain amount of supply . thus the _ realized _ values of advertisers would be larger and the social welfare get enhanced .",
    "after the number of advertisers reaches about five , the growth of prices and revenues seems saturated : more advertisers would not bring evident enhancement in prices and revenues .",
    "this can be derived from our parameter setting : @xmath401 is the approximate amount of demand for each advertiser , and since the total supply is one , in expectation it would be sufficient for five advertisers to consume all the supply .",
    "3 .   figure [ simu : fig1](a ) corresponds with theorem [ theo : price_duo_vs_price_mono ] that the monopoly price is smaller than the duopoly price @xmath103 of engine 1 and larger than price @xmath116 of engine 2 .",
    "we further notice that the monopoly price is actually very close to @xmath103 but @xmath116 is much smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "this is because the monopoly engine and engine 1 in competition face advertisers with the same distribution of values .",
    "recall that value is the maximal willingness to pay for advertisers , thus when there are too many advertisers competing with each other , the price would approach the maximal possible value , which is @xmath402 according to the distribution range .",
    "however , for search engine 2 , the _ actual values _ of advertisers are the _ original values _ discounted by @xmath211 .",
    "the lower @xmath211 is , the larger the gap between @xmath103 and @xmath116 would be .",
    "4 .   figure [ simu : fig1](b ) shows that revenue of search engine 1 is larger than that of engine 2 .",
    "this can be easily deducted since the revenue of each engine is @xmath403 , @xmath404 and we have @xmath97 , @xmath405 . as we have mentioned , the monopoly price @xmath395 is approximately equal to @xmath103",
    ". therefore the monopoly revenue can be denoted as follows : @xmath406 where @xmath407 is the discount factor of the indifferent advertisers which is always less than one .",
    "this inequality explains the gap between total revenue under competition and monopoly in figure [ simu : fig1](b ) .",
    "the utility of advertisers depends on two factors : the value and the price .",
    "compared with the monopoly , under competition a portion of advertisers could enjoy a relatively lower price which would result in higher utility ; at the same time , due to the effect of @xmath211 , the values of advertisers in engine 2 get discounted which would cause lower utility . when the positive factor of lower price dominate the negative factor of lower value , the utility under competition would be greater and vice versa .",
    "since in our baseline setting we set a relatively large @xmath211 , the negative factor would be small and advertisers in engine 2 can benefit from the lower price .",
    "this conjecture can be verified in figure [ simu : fig1](c ) . since in average",
    "_ brand advertisers _",
    "account for half of all advertisers , in monopoly the utility of brand advertisers is always half of the utility of all advertisers as shown in figure [ simu : fig1](c ) .",
    "however , under competition the brand advertisers would benefit more than the rest advertisers since they have higher discount factors which means lower negative effect on values but confronting a lower price in engine 2 . 6 .",
    "figure [ simu : fig1](d ) indicates that the social welfare under competition is lower than that under monopoly since the realized values in equation ( [ eq : sw : simu ] ) get discounted due to the factor @xmath211 .    *",
    "effect of supplies *    we now change the supplies to @xmath408 and @xmath409 while all other parameters remain the same .",
    "the simulation results are presented in figure [ simu : fig2 ] .    in this",
    "setting one search engine plays the leading role in the market and the follower can only take a small fraction of market share .",
    "this assumption is more realistic considering the current dominant position of google in most areas of the world .",
    "figure [ simu : fig2](a ) shows little difference with the corresponding price curves in figure [ simu : fig1](a ) since all prices approach the maximal possible value when there are sufficient number of advertisers in the market . since the supply of engine 2 decreases , the revenue of engine 2 which is denoted by @xmath404 would also drop . according to equation ( [ eq : revenue_mono : simu ] )",
    ", the gap of the total revenues is @xmath410 .",
    "therefore when @xmath411 is small , the gap would also be negligible .",
    "this is verified by figure [ simu : fig2](b ) .",
    "this result also demonstrates that even when the follower takes a small portion of market share and provides service of relatively lower quality , it can still make nontrivial profit through competition and survive in the market . in figure",
    "[ simu : fig2](c ) , the gain of aggregate utility under competition is tiny compared with that under monopoly since engine 2 can only provide limited supply ( 10% of the total supply ) and only very few of advertisers can take advantage of it . figure [ simu : fig2](d ) shows that the loss of social welfare under competition is very small since only 10% of the total supply is of lower quality , i.e. , the second term in equation ( [ eq : sw : simu ] ) is insignificant .     +    * ( 3 ) .",
    "effect of discount factors *    we now turn to investigate the effect of technology gap between two search engines .",
    "let the discount factors be drawn uniformly on @xmath412 and all other parameters are the same as the baseline setting .",
    "as figure [ simu : fig3](a ) shows , the equilibrium price @xmath103 of engine 1 and the monopoly price @xmath395 are still close to the maximal value of advertisers and @xmath116 approaches the maximal discounted value @xmath413 .",
    "as @xmath211 decreases , the price of engine 2 also diminishes compared with @xmath116 in figure [ simu : fig1](a ) and [ simu : fig2](a ) .",
    "since the revenue @xmath23 and from above analysis we know @xmath103 has little change and @xmath116 diminishes , the revenue @xmath414 of engine 1 would stay almost the same while @xmath411 reduces as shown in figure [ simu : fig3](b ) .",
    "since we have also mentioned that the gap between the total revenues approximates to @xmath410 , when @xmath211 is small , the gap would become larger .",
    "this can be easily seen by comparing the corresponding revenue curves in figure [ simu : fig1](b ) and figure [ simu : fig3](b ) .",
    "the aggregate utilities of advertisers in monopoly are the same in figure [ simu : fig1](c ) and figure [ simu : fig3](c ) ; however , the aggregate utilities under competition in figure [ simu : fig3](c ) is much smaller than those in figure [ simu : fig1](c ) due to the negative effect of @xmath211 on advertisers values . in figure [ simu : fig3](c ) we see that there is certain intersection between utility under competition and monopoly . when there are only a few of advertisers , the prices are still low and the main factor affecting utility is the value . under competition",
    "the existence of @xmath211 would drive down advertisers values and thereby results in lower aggregate utility .",
    "as the number of advertisers increases , the monopoly price @xmath395 would approach the maximal value @xmath415 and the aggregate utility would gradually reduce to zero . however , even when @xmath103 and @xmath395 approach @xmath402 , the rest of advertisers whose discount factors are larger than the equilibrium price ratio @xmath416 can still obtain nontrivial utility which can be approximated as @xmath417 ( @xmath418 denotes the average value of advertisers with discount factors larger than the price ratio @xmath407 ) .",
    "figure [ simu : fig3](d ) displays the hug gap between social welfare under competition and monopoly . since half of the supply ( @xmath419 ) is allocated to advertisers with discount factors less than @xmath420 , the realized values in equation ( [ eq : sw : simu ] ) would become significantly smaller than social welfare under monopoly .     +",
    "we propose an analytical framework to model the interaction of publishers , advertisers and users under monopoly and duopoly scenarios . for monopoly market , we can give the analytical results of price and revenue for both ex ante and ex post case . for duopoly market",
    ", we formulate a three - stage dynamic game to model the search engines competition for both users and advertisers and prove the existence of nash equilibrium from _ ex post _ perspective . to see the _ long - term _ effect of competition from _ ex ante _ perspective , we carry out computer simulations for different settings of participants parameters .",
    "the comparative results of revenues and social welfare under competition and monopoly are then presented and discussed extensively in the paper .",
    "our analysis could provide some insight in regulating the search engine market and protecting the interests of advertisers and end users . although the cooperation between search engines can probably bring more total revenues , advertisers and users",
    "may be averse to such plan which eliminates their freedom to choose from diverse services provided by different search companies .",
    "there are several possible ways to extend our work . throughout our paper",
    ", we implicitly assume that advertisers would reveal their true parameters such as values and budgets to the search engines . since our framework is by no means strategy - proof ,",
    "how would rational advertisers strategies affect our conclusions would be an interesting question for further investigation .",
    "another non - trivial problem is how to associate our analytical result of revenue from _ one _ particular keyword with the practical revenue of an industrial search company which gathers from _ numerous _ keywords queried by end users everyday . besides",
    ", to be in line with the practical advertising system nowadays , we will consider incorporating the quality factor of advertisement for the revenue - ranking rule as well as the generalized second - price auction prevailing in major search engines .",
    "finally , it would be intriguing to extend our model for multiple search engines scenario besides the basic duopoly scenario .",
