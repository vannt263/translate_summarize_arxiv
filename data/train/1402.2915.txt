    "the standard model ( sm ) has been considerably successful in describing the physics of electroweak interactions . in spite of this , some questions still remain unanswered , particularly , the number of fermion generations and their complex pattern of mixing angles and masses have not been explained by the sm .",
    "these problems are considered to have been answered by composite models @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the known leptons and quarks can be regarded as the ground state to a rich spectrum of excited states .",
    "thus , charged ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and neutral ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) excited leptons would be an incontrovertible proof for compositeness @xcite .",
    "so far , any signal for excited neutrinos were not observed at the colliders .",
    "the mass limits of excited neutrinos were found to be @xmath10 gev from its single production , and @xmath11 gev from its pair production at the lep @xcite .",
    "an excited neutrino with a mass less than @xmath12 gev by h1 collaboration at the hera has excluded assuming @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite . in the literature ,",
    "the excited neutrinos have been experimentally or theoretically examined at the hera @xcite , lep @xcite , and lhc @xcite .",
    "the interaction between excited fermions , gauge bosons and ordinary fermions is described by @xcite @xmath15\\textit{l}_{l}+h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the scale of the new physics responsible for the existence of excited neutrinos , @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the dirac matrices , @xmath19 represents the pauli matrices , @xmath20 is the weak hypercharge , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the coupling parameters associated with the corresponding gauge groups , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the field strength tensors of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the coupling constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .    the excited neutrino - lepton - gauge bosons vertices through above effective lagrangian can be obtained as follows    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    an excited neutrino decays into a sm lepton and a gauge boson .",
    "therefore , excited neutrinos can have a total of three decay modes : charged weak decay @xmath32 , neutral weak decay @xmath33 and radiative decay @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , ignoring ordinary lepton masses the decay widths for the various electroweak decay channels of the excited neutrino are given by    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the electroweak coupling constants .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 couplings are specified by the composite dynamics , and they are not usually equal to each other in the case of the process of single excited neutrino production . also , the @xmath43 coupling is proportional to @xmath44 term .",
    "if @xmath21 and @xmath22 are not equal to each other , then radiative decay is allowed for an excited neutrino .",
    "excited electrons could contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment of electrons .",
    "the possible contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of electron have been examined by ref .",
    "@xcite . using results from these theoretical calculations and measurements on anomalous magnetic moments of the electron",
    ", @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters can be constrained under the assumptions @xmath14 with @xmath45 @xcite . however , they are generally used as @xmath46 or @xmath47 with @xmath45 in the literature .",
    "the branching ratios and total decay widths depending on the mass of excited neutrinos are given in tables i and ii .",
    "at @xmath46 the branching ratios for large values of excited neutrino mass reach @xmath48 for charged current decays , and @xmath49 for neutral current decays .",
    "in addition , for the case @xmath47 the photon channel does not vanish and the branchings for the charged , radiative and neutral current channels are obtained as @xmath48 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "hence , we assume that excited neutrinos only decay to the charged current channel , since this channel is dominant .    the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "is expected to answer some of the fundamental open questions in particle physics . on the other hand",
    ", it may not provide precision measurements due to the typical characteristic of a hadron machine .",
    "a tev scale linear @xmath52 collider with high - luminosity is the best option to complement and to extend the lhc physics program .",
    "the compact linear collider ( clic ) is a planned linear collider concept based on normal conducting accelerating cavities and two beam acceleration @xcite .",
    "it is proposed to carry out collisions at energies from @xmath53 to @xmath54 tev .",
    "it has been foreseen that this collider will be performed in several research regions @xcite .",
    "these research regions are given in table iii .",
    "the first stage of the clic will allow the obtainment of high precision measurements of various observables of the sm higgs boson , top and gauge sectors @xcite . the second stage will give access to the discovery of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "additional higgs features such as the higgs self - coupling and the top - yukawa coupling and rare higgs decay modes will be analyzed at this stage @xcite .",
    "the final stage of clic operating at an energy of @xmath54 tev is expected to provide the most precise measurements of the sm , and to directly examine the pair - production of new heavy particles of mass up to @xmath55 tev @xcite .",
    "a new possibility anticipated for the linear colliders is to operate this machine as @xmath56 and @xmath57 colliders @xcite .",
    "this can be realized by converting the incoming leptons into an intense beam of high - energy photons .",
    "the linear colliders also provide the opportunity to examine the @xmath58 and @xmath59 collisions with quasi real photons @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 collisions can occur spontaneously with respect to @xmath57 and @xmath56 collisions .",
    "for this reason , the investigation of new physics beyond the sm with @xmath58 and @xmath59 collisions is more realistic than @xmath57 and @xmath56 collisions occurring via the laser backscattering procedure .",
    "@xmath3 photons are emitted from one of the @xmath60 or @xmath61 beams and defined by the weizsacker - williams approximation ( wwa ) . in the wwa ,",
    "the virtuality of the photons which carry a small transverse momentum is very low .",
    "hence , the photons emitted from @xmath60 or @xmath61 beams are generally scattered with very small angles from their trajectory along the beam path .",
    "this approximation has many advantages .",
    "it allows the ability to obtain crude numerical estimations through simple formulas @xcite . also , it may substantially ease the experimental analysis because it enables one to obtain directly an approximate cross section for @xmath62 process through the analysis of the process @xmath63 @xcite",
    "finally , these processes have a very clean experimental environment , since they have no interference with weak and strong interactions .",
    "photon - induced processes have been experimentally or theoretically investigated in the framework of the wwa at the lep , tevatron , and lhc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , new physics studies are performed by making use of wwa at the clic in literature @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the production and signatures of doubly charged higgs bosons in the process @xmath64 have been investigated",
    ". however , ref .",
    "@xcite examined the electromagnetic moments of the tau lepton in the process @xmath65 .",
    "the anomalous @xmath66 interactions via the process @xmath67 have been analyzed by ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , ref .",
    "@xcite has studied the signals for composite vector leptoquarks through @xmath68 and @xmath69 collisions .",
    "@xcite has shown that the excited neutrinos via the process @xmath70 at lhc could be accessible up to a mass of 1.5 tev , assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath71 fb@xmath72 and @xmath47 .",
    "however , single production of excited neutrinos in @xmath73 colliders through @xmath74 supposing @xmath46 has been investigated by ref .",
    "@xcite . they found that excited neutrinos can be discovered up to the mass of @xmath75 gev . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , at the same center - of - mass energy , the most ideal collider for investigating excited neutrinos between @xmath76 , @xmath73 and @xmath77 colliders is an @xmath76 collider .",
    "for this reason , the clic provides an excellent opportunity to examine the signal of the excited neutrino .",
    "therefore , we investigated the single and pair production of excited neutrinos through the processes @xmath0 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 at the clic .",
    "the production mechanism for the single excited neutrino in @xmath52 collision at the clic is given by the process @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "this process is described by three tree - level diagrams , and its polarization summed amplitude is given as follows    @xmath81    @xmath82 ; @xmath83 is the weinberg angle .    in the course of all the calculations in this paper",
    ", we used the simulation program comphep-4.5.1 to calculate the cross sections of the signal and background @xcite . in this work",
    ", we took into account all possible cases with regard all tree - level sm model for the analyzed processes .",
    "tree level diagrams generate major sm contributions .",
    "possible other sm backgrounds contributing to these processes are at the loop level and they can be ignored when compared to tree - level sm backgrounds . in fig .",
    "@xmath84 , the total cross section of the process @xmath85 as a function of the excited neutrino mass for various values of coupling parameters and center - of - mass energies is given .",
    "actually , since excited neutrinos are not in the sm , it is impossible to examine this process .",
    "however , if excited neutrinos exists , the sm cross section of analyzed processes changes with mass of excited neutrino as seen in fig .",
    "we also find from these figures that the total cross sections of the processes decrease with a decrease in the coupling parameter and excited neutrino mass since the amplitudes are proportional to these parameters . in fig .",
    "@xmath54 , the invariant mass @xmath86 distribution of signal for different mass values of excited neutrinos at the @xmath87 and @xmath54 tev and parameter @xmath47 for the process @xmath85 are plotted .",
    "the size of the peak increases when the center - of - mass energy increases .",
    "a quasi real photon emitted from one of the @xmath60 or @xmath61 beams can interact with the other beam and the subprocess @xmath89 can occur at the clic . hence , it would be possible to examine @xmath59 collisions . a schematic diagram describing this process is presented in fig . @xmath90 . in the existence of the effective lagrangian in eq .",
    "( @xmath80 ) , feynman diagrams of the subprocess @xmath89 containing anomalous @xmath91 and @xmath92 couplings are given in fig . @xmath93 .",
    "the analytical expression of squared amplitudes can be given in terms of mandelstam variables by the formula :    @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    @xmath97    if radiative decay of the excited neutrino vanishes ( @xmath14 ) , then @xmath92 coupling can be isolated through the subprocess @xmath89 .",
    "for this reason , we compared the total cross sections of single excited neutrino production of the process @xmath98 as a function of excited neutrino mass at @xmath99 and @xmath100 values to understand the effects of @xmath101 in an excited neutrino production mechanism in fig .",
    "it can be seen from these figures that the total cross sections of the process at @xmath103 coupling parameters are greater than @xmath14 values .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath86 distributions of signal for different mass values of excited neutrinos are given in fig .",
    "@xmath104 , assuming @xmath47 .",

    "@xmath107 . in case of effective interaction @xmath91 ,",
    "the polarization summed amplitude square for the subprocess is given by    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     we will not review the process @xmath2 at @xmath109 tev , since the experimental mass limit of the excited neutrino is @xmath12 gev .",
    "the sm and new physics total cross sections of the process @xmath110 as a function of the excited neutrino mass at values of @xmath99 coupling parameters and @xmath111 tev is depicted in fig . @xmath112 .",
    "we need to carry out statistical analysis for a detailed examination of the excited neutrino signal . in this study , we estimate sensitivity of the processes @xmath85 , @xmath113 , and @xmath110 on the mass of the excited neutrino using two different statistical analysis methods .",
    "we perform a one - parameter @xmath114 analysis when the number of sm events is greater than @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath114 analysis is defined by    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the total cross section containing sm and new physics , @xmath117 is the statistical error : @xmath118 is the number of sm events . in the second analysis",
    ", we applied a poisson distribution , due to the number of sm events smaller than or equal to @xmath112 . here , the bounds on the excited neutrino mass are calculated supposing the number of observed events equal to the sm prediction .",
    "upper bounds of the number of events @xmath119 at the @xmath120 c. l. can be obtained as follows @xcite    @xmath121    in addition , for each process we imposed a cut on the invariant mass @xmath86 to suppress the sm background and to extract the excited neutrino signal .",
    "hence , we perform the cuts @xmath122 gev for @xmath123 gev , @xmath124 gev for @xmath125 gev , and @xmath126 gev for @xmath127 gev .",

    "a @xmath131 boson can decay into a lepton and neutrino .",
    "then , our process consisted of two neutrinos in the final state , and this situation caused a great uncertainty . therefore , we took into account the hadronic decay of the @xmath131 boson with the branching through @xmath132 .",
    "also , we applied the cuts @xmath133 gev and @xmath134 for the electron in the final state .",
    "here , @xmath135 is the transverse momentum and @xmath136 is the pseudorapidity .    after applying the above condition , the sm cross sections for the process @xmath85 such as at excited neutrino masses @xmath137 gev and @xmath138 gev are obtained as @xmath139 pb and @xmath140 pb for a center - of - mass energy of @xmath53 tev , respectively . in addition , we have calculated the sm cross sections as @xmath141 pb and @xmath142 pb for excited neutrino masses @xmath137 gev and @xmath143 gev at @xmath144 tev , respectively .",
    "finally , at @xmath145 tev , we found the sm cross sections to be @xmath146 pb and @xmath147 pb for excited neutrino masses @xmath137 gev and @xmath148 gev , respectively . for the @xmath149 and @xmath80 coupling parameters , @xmath120 c.l .",

    "we can see from these figures that the excited neutrinos for the process @xmath85 can be determined up to the center - of - mass energy of three stages of the clic .",
    "in particular , the accessible limits for the excited neutrino mass at @xmath151 and @xmath152 fb@xmath72 is approximately obtained as @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath148 gev at @xmath87 and @xmath54 tev , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the sm event number for the process @xmath155 is given by    @xmath156    here , we considered that one of the @xmath131 bosons decayed leptonically and the other hadronically for the signal . hence",
    ", we assumed that the branching ratio of the @xmath131 bosons in the final state was @xmath157 .",

    "also , at the same center - of - mass energies , we found excited neutrino masses as @xmath177 and @xmath178 gev for @xmath179 and @xmath180 fb@xmath72 .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath73 and @xmath77 colliders have high luminosity and high energy , they do not have a very clean environment due to the proton remnants . on the other hand , linear @xmath52 colliders with tev scale energy and extremely high luminosity",
    "have less background than @xmath73 and @xmath77 colliders .",
    "for this reason , the linear colliders can investigate excited neutrinos with a much higher precision with respect to the @xmath73 and @xmath77 colliders . according to @xmath73 and @xmath77 colliders , at the same center - of - mass energy and coupling parameter values , the linear colliders are more likely to determine the excited neutrinos .",
    "therefore , we have investigated the processes @xmath0 , @xmath78 , and @xmath181 at the clic to examine signals of the excited neutrino .",
    "we show that the best process determining the excited neutrinos from these processes at the clic is @xmath0 .",
    "also , excited neutrinos can be obtained up to the center - of - mass energies of this process at @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , the clic provides us an excellent opportunity to probe the excited neutrinos in a very clean environment .",
