    "research in spintronics  @xcite , a spin based electronics , has led to a number of fundamental discoveries in physics and it has a clear potential impact in the emerging quantum technologies , such as quantum information processing  @xcite . among the most intriguing proposals in this context",
    "there is the spin - field - effect transistor ( sfet ) introduced by datta and das  @xcite ( for a review see also ref .",
    "[ ] and references therein ) .",
    "spin - polarized carriers are selectively injected in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , while spin precession is externally controlled by means of a local gate voltage which modulates the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi )  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of achieving gate control of the soi strength has been experimentally established since the end of the 90s ",
    "see e.g. refs .",
    "spin - polarized injection into a semiconductor proved instead to be a more difficult task  @xcite which has been partially overcome only recently  @xcite delaying the first implementation of a sfet by almost a decade  @xcite",
    ".    the challenging requirements of the sfet can be more naturally met in a quantum hall system . in the present work",
    "we introduce a generalization of the datta - das transistor in which gate - controlled spin procession is accompanied by coherent electron transfer between co - propagating chiral edge channels of the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )  @xcite . due to the possibility of individually contacting chiral edge states that have opposite values of the spin degree of freedom ,",
    "our proposal completely avoids the injection problems  @xcite one faces in the original sfet setting .",
    "furthermore , our implementation of the sfet represents a useful tool available for quantum hall interferometry  @xcite , since it can also be employed as a tunable beam - splitter , especially in the newly introduced co - propagating architecture of ref .",
    "[ ] . as such it constitutes a potentially scalable building block for implementing quantum information processing  @xcite based on dual - rail encoding schemes  @xcite . finally , chiral states of the iqhe are ideal for long distance transfer of spin states , owing to the very large relaxation  @xcite and coherence  @xcite lengths .    , spin - up ) and red ( inner edge @xmath0 , spin - down ) trajectories .",
    "the periodic array of top gates controlled by the voltage @xmath1 represents the scattering active region .",
    "[ fig1],width=302 ]    the quantum hall sfet discussed here operates in the iqhe regime at filling factor @xmath2 ( number of filled energy levels in the bulk ) in the presence of a weak uniform rashba soi .",
    "the two orthogonal chiral states @xmath3 and @xmath4 belonging to the lowest landau level co - propagate at slightly different wave vectors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , spatially separated along the transverse @xmath7-direction , and have ( almost ) opposite @xmath8-spin components .",
    "the underlying principle of operation can be summarized as follows ( the setup is schematized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . exploiting large top gates g1 and g3 that locally lower the filling factor to @xmath9 , it is possible to separately contact @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , spin - up electrons ( in @xmath3 ) can be injected by applying a bias voltage @xmath10 to contact 1 , leaving the other three contacts grounded , while a measurement of the charge current in contact 3 and 4 allows to determine the spin in a spin - charge conversion fashion .",
    "spin precession occurs if the difference @xmath11 in momentum of the two chiral states is compensated ( this is not required in the original datta and das setting ) . to tackle this problem",
    "we adopt a periodic - poling technique similar to that one experimentally realized in ref .  [ ] where an engineered coupling between co - propagating chiral spin - resolved edge states was achieved by means of an array of magnetic cobalt contacts .",
    "specifically , we consider a periodic array of electric top gates , placed between contacts 1 and 3 of the device ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , which generate a periodic electrostatic potential and modulate the rashba soi in the 2deg region underneath them . under these conditions , we show that when the periodicity @xmath12 of the modulation is adjusted at the resonant condition @xmath13 a strong enhancement of the spin transfer is obtained and it can be externally controlled by varying the top gate voltage ( typical values of @xmath14 are hundreds of nanometers in gaas , easily experimentally achievable ",
    "see e.g. refs .  [ ] ) . as a result ,",
    "in the same spirit of the original datta and das scheme  @xcite , our method provides an _ electrically tunable _ way to achieve a resonant spin - field - effect transistor in quantum hall systems .",

    "a rigorous analysis of the effect is obtained by expressing the chiral edge states @xmath3 and @xmath4 as eigenvectors of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath15 , where @xmath16 describes a 2deg in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath17 and of a transverse confining potential @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the weak uniform rashba soi contribution .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( which extends in the longitudinal @xmath41-direction for a region of length @xmath49 ) produces two net effects , both contributing to electron transfer from @xmath50 to @xmath0 .",
    "first of all , the array of top gates induces a periodic modulation of the electrostatic potential underneath the gates that can be described by adding to the hamiltonian a term @xmath51 the latter locally mixes the landau levels and it can open mini - gaps in the spectrum . however , as long as the potential @xmath52 is restricted to a small region @xmath53 and @xmath54 , no qualitative change is expected in the structure of edge states  @xcite . in this regime , even though @xmath52 does not couple to the spin degree of freedom of the system , it can contribute indirectly to the coupling between @xmath50 and @xmath0 due to the modification of the edge states induced by the homogeneous @xmath55 term in the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , a second important effect introduced by the gate array is a periodic modulation of the rashba coupling constant  @xmath20 . we describe it as an additional perturbation term to @xmath56 of the form @xmath57 where the modulation @xmath58 has the same spatial dependence as @xmath59 but strength @xmath60 , and where the symmetrized product @xmath61 is inserted to ensure hermiticity of the soi term .",
    "similar contributions have been analyzed for spin transport in quantum wires , both in a single particle - picture @xcite and for an interacting nanowires @xcite and helical modes in the quantum spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "the @xmath62 term provides a direct spin - flip mechanism that is resonantly enhanced by the periodicity of the gate array and couples @xmath3 and  @xmath4 . according to refs .",

    "it follows that @xmath68 can be tuned almost by a factor 2 and that @xmath69 for all practical purposes .",
    "we characterize the transport properties of the system in the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite .",
    "the current flowing through the output contacts can be determined knowing the amplitudes for scattering off the region underneath the top gate array of fig .",
    "asymptotic states are defined far away from the scattering region and are given by the edge states of the hall bar @xmath50 and @xmath0 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psiouter],[eq : psiinner ] ) .",

    "the transmission amplitude for scattering from the incoming state @xmath0 to the outgoing states @xmath50 is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the velocities of the incoming and outgoing states , respectively .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : bornapp ] ) clearly shows how the periodicity of the gate array can provide the correct amount of momentum transfer giving rise to resonant coupling of the edge states at @xmath84 .",

    "such conditions are widely fulfilled . for inas",
    "the spin - orbit length can be estimated to be of the order of hundreds on nanometers ( using @xmath95 ) and , for @xmath96 , one has @xmath97 .",

    "for these parameters , in the absence of the array we obtain an intrinsic channel mixing of less than 0.1% ( due to the broken translation invariance owing to the geometry of the injection / detection regions in the device ) , which confirms that the effect of soi , as such , is negligible .",

    "( [ eq : bornapp ] ) . for increasing values of the electrostatic potential @xmath85",
    "we see a shift of the resonant periodicity @xmath14 to smaller values .",
    "this is consistent with a local non - linear modification of the confining potential and a local decrease of the fermi energy , together yielding an increase of the wave vector difference , which acquires an effective gate - voltage dependence , @xmath112 , entailing a  red - shift \" of the resonant peak @xmath113 .",
    "since the value of the resonant periodicity is _ a priori _ unknown and sample - dependent , such effect turns out to be a useful control knob of the setup ( the range of periodicities at which a given sample can resonate spanning more than 100 nm ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig]b for a fixed periodicity , by varying the voltage applied to the gates it is possible to control the precession of the spin , characteristic of a sfet .",

    "therefore , also in the case of an array with 20 top gates shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] a good transistor functionality can be achieved .",
    "it is worth noticing that in iii - v compounds the dresselhaus soi , originating from a bulk inversion asymmetry in zinc - blende structures @xcite , is also present .",

    "this can be easily taken into account : at first order in @xmath121 the edge states are @xmath122 with the renormalized momenta obtained by solving @xmath123 , and the bulk gap is still dominated by the zeeman energy . as a result the multiplicative factor in the square bracket eq .",

    "one of the major problems in the original datta - das transistor is the limitation to ballistic 2degs . due to the spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "the spin orientation is momentum - dependent : elastic scattering randomizes the spin already after few scattering events spoiling the spin precession dynamics .",
    "a great advantage of our proposal is the overcoming of this problem .",
    "indeed , the resonant nature of the spin - flip mechanism and the chiral , one - dimensional , character of integer qh edge states suggest that the resonant sfet is robust against disorder within the adiabatic transport regime  @xcite . to corroborate this intuitive argument",
    "we have run numerical tight - binding simulations which include : i ) the presence of imperfections in the periodicity of the fingers , ii ) the presence of corrugations at the sample edge .",
    "the results show deviations from the clean situation only for unrealistically strong disorder .",
    "we now comment about two possible material systems ( gaas and inas - based heterostructures ) , which suite best the implementation of our setup . due to",
    "the larger rashba coupling constant , a stronger effect could be seen in inas - based devices .",
    "however , the larger rashba coupling constant is also responsible for more sensitivity to disorder , resulting in a shorter spin - relaxation length @xmath125 that would limit the scalability of the device ( the ratio being estimated as @xmath126 @xcite ) . besides , in inas the @xmath27-factor can be about an order of magnitude larger than in gaas .",
    "this implies a resonant periodicity of the array an order of magnitude smaller than the case of gaas , which could represent a technical problem for very large @xmath27-factors .      as a first kind of disorder we consider the case of non - perfect periodicity of the gate array potential",
    "this class of disorder well describes imprecisions in the nanofabrication of the gates as well as non - uniformities in the different sections of the hall bar .",
    "we model this disorder by randomizing each finger position in a range @xmath127 around its ideal position .",
    "the parameter @xmath128 can thus be considered as the `` degree of imperfection '' : if @xmath129 the array is ideal , whereas if @xmath130 the position of each potential peak in the region is practically random , and the original periodicity is severely spoiled . in fig .",

    "to @xmath132 we see no difference in the position and height of the main resonance peak , although we record an attenuation of the secondary peaks as we increase the degree of imperfection .",
    "as we further increase the value of @xmath128 we see that the height of the main resonance peak gets lower and additional secondary peaks start to show up .",
    "this is due to the fact that the randomization procedure generates higher harmonics in the fourier spectrum of the periodic potential , with reduced amplitude .",
    "the device response then corresponds to a sum of weak resonances at each harmonic .",

    "<S> we propose a resonant spin - field - effect transistor for chiral spin - resolved edge states in the integer quantum hall effect with rashba spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it employs a periodic array of voltage - controlled top gates that locally modulate the rashba spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> strong resonant spin - field - effect is achieved when the array periodicity matches the inverse of the wave - vector difference of the two chiral states involved . </S>",
    "<S> well known techniques of separately contacting the edge states make possible to selectively populate and read - out the edge states , allowing full spin read - out . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant nature of the spin - field effect and the adiabatic character of the edge states guarantee a high degree of robustness with respect to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> our device represents the quantum hall version of the all - electrical datta - das spin - field effect transistor . </S>"
