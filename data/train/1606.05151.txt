    "this is of the order of kpc if the particle mass is @xmath3 ev @xcite . the strongest constraint in this mass range to date follows from the predicted suppression of early galaxy formation and the measured optical depth to reionization , yielding @xmath4 ev @xcite .",
    "while ulas provide a well - motivated class of candidate particles , the same phenomenology applies more generally to any massive scalar field with negligible self - interactions in a coherent non - thermal state , e.g. as a consequence of being produced by vacuum realignment , which include subclasses of scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) @xcite and bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) dark matter @xcite . the class of scalars with negligible self - interactions in the mass range relevant for constraints from structure formation is often referred to as fuzzy dark matter ( fdm ) @xcite .",
    "we will follow this convention here .    to clearly distinguish the effects of fdm from other modifications of cdm with suppressed small - scale growth such as warm dark matter",
    ", it will be necessary to search for generic signatures of fdm on halo density profiles and substructure .",
    "one such signature may be the existence of compact solitonic cores embedded in a halo with nfw - like density profile , found in cosmological simulations that used the comoving schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) equations to model fdm @xcite ( who used the notation @xmath5 dm to emphasize the wavelike nature of dark matter ) .",
    "their density profiles are governed by well - known equilibrium solutions for self - gravitating scalar fields in the nonrelativistic regime whose properties have been studied intensively in the context of newtonian boson stars @xcite and bec dark matter @xcite .",
    "the core mass obeys a scaling relation with the mass of the host halo , @xmath6 , which can be motivated by identifying the characteristic scale height of the solitonic core with the virial velocity de broglie wavelength @xcite .",

    "as the authors of @xcite pointed out , in the context of galaxy cluster observations with indications of an offset between dark and stellar matter @xcite , this effect can provide an alternative explanation to self - interacting dark matter .",

    "since the time scales for major mergers and subhalo evolution ( determined by dynamical friction ) are large compared to the gravitational time scales of the cores , much can be learned from the simplified problem of isolated mergers of two cores with different characteristic properties .",
    "one of the key questions is the efficiency of gravitational cooling of the newly formed core to shed mass and angular momentum as a function of the binary parameters @xcite .",
    "the results can be used , for instance , in semi - analytic models for galaxy formation in fdm cosmologies .    in this work ,",
    "we therefore address the simplified setup of merging solitonic cores in three - dimensional sp simulations .",

    "collisions and mergers of newtonian boson stars have been studied extensively in 2d @xcite but we are unaware of fully three - dimensional simulations with no imposed symmetries .",
    "furthermore , a systematic investigation of final core masses after relaxation by gravitational cooling has been lacking so far .",

    "the cores are scaled such that the heavier one has a central density @xmath59 roughly corresponding to the present cosmic critical density , giving a core radius @xmath60 .",

    "initially , the cores are placed at @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the density profiles of the two cores and @xmath71 is the wavenumber corresponding to their relative velocity .",
    "the time @xmath72 of maximal interference is defined by @xmath73 . at that time , @xmath74 we thus expect that the period of the interference pattern is given by the de broglie wave length @xmath75 corresponding to the relative velocity . here ,",

    "the interference pattern predicted by matches the numerical results as seen in . during the interaction , gravity slightly contracts the density profiles . neglecting this small effect",
    ", we see that they remain in a superposition state of two solitonic cores even during their interaction .",
    "as expected , the potential energy mildly increases during the collision , while mass and total energy are conserved . during the collision , the kinetic energy from the cores relative motion",
    "is stored in the interference pattern , strongly boosting the gradient energy contribution @xmath29 . at later times",
    ", the energy is transferred back to the cores motion .",
    "there is no significant decrease in velocity or deformation of the density profiles due to the collision .",
    "the cores thus indeed behave like solitons in this regime .",
    "the evolution of a bound binary system with negative total energy is very different . in this case , the cores rapidly merge and relax to a new solitonic core by gravitational cooling @xcite .",

    "as before , the cores are scaled such that the central density of the heavier core obeys @xmath80 .",

    "initially , @xmath88 as expected , decreasing roughly by @xmath89% during the merger .",
    "after a while , the ejected mass reaches the sponge and is absorbed .",
    "this does not alter the results , since in all conducted runs , the ejected mass is roughly an order of magnitude above the escape velocity @xmath90 and will not fall back onto the core .        in the case of solitonic cores with",
    "equal mass ( @xmath91 ) but opposite phase ( @xmath65 ) , the destructive interference gives rise to a repulsive interaction , causing the cores to bounce off each other several times before merging ( cf .",

    "the arrows indicate the bounces which result in a noticeable compression of the individual cores .",
    "radiation produced by each encouter results in a damping of the bounces and a decreasing amplitude of the compression .",
    "eventually , the symmetry is broken by the accumulation of small numerical errors producing a slight phase shift , causing the cores to merge in the end . at later times , the evolution is qualitatively identical to the case with @xmath64 as can be seen by comparing the core and halo mass evolution in .",
    "volume rendered images of both runs are shown in . especially in the upper panels , a noticeable eccentricity of the newly formed core can be recognized .",

    ", their internal velocity fields roughly confine density distributions on elliptical orbits .",
    "a slice through a representative ellipsoid is shown in .",
    "further analysis will be the subject of future work .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of the repulsive interaction to small deviations from exact phase opposition by considering a phase difference @xmath92 . in this case , only a single bounce occurs before the cores merge .",
    "similarly , for a mass ratio @xmath93 and @xmath65 the cores merge without any observable repulsion .",
    "these results suggest that in any realistic scenario absent finely tuned phase opposition and mass equality , repulsive behavior of colliding solitonic cores can be ignored for all practical purposes .",

    "for all runs , we set , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 mpc km / s so that the cores are bounded and overlap when reaching the semi - minor axis .",
    "our main result is that the core mass evolution is nearly independent of these parameters within the considered ranges . in all cases ,",
    "the mass of the emerging core is approximately @xmath85 of the sum of the progenitors core masses .",
    "the core and total mass evolution of eight representative runs are shown in .",
    "the ratio between final core and total masses is approximately one fifth implying that @xmath97 of the remaining bound mass resides in the solitonic core while the remainder has formed a diffuse halo around it .",
    "note that due to the restriction to small angular momenta and mass ratios , the total energy varies only very little for all runs .",
    "the energy dependent final core masses @xmath98 of the above runs are shown in ( run 1 ) .     and",
    "total energy @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "multiple core mergers are shown as run 4 ( cf . ) .",
    "see main text for details . ]",
    "assuming a constant fraction of final to initial core masses of @xmath99 even for @xmath100 implies that the final core is less massive than the more massive progenitor if @xmath101 .",
    "we therefore expect the change of @xmath102 of the more massive core to saturate at roughly this mass ratio .",
    "this is qualitatively confirmed by our simulations . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the less massive core is completely disrupted and forms a diffuse halo .",
    "shows the core mass evolution for different mass ratios ( left ) . here , the initial core mass corresponds to the more massive core . on the right",
    ", the final radial density profiles can be seen .",
    "they consist of a solitonic core well fitted by and a shallow outer tail .",
    "interestingly , the tails in all cases approximately follow a power law decline with a logarithmic slope of roughly @xmath104 as expected for the outer parts of a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halo profile .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the results of @xcite but finding nfw - like halos already in the case of binary mergers suggests that it may be more robust than previously expected .",
    "the fitted core masses are mildly energy dependent as can be seen in ( run 2 ) .",
    "they very broadly follow a power law with @xmath105 in , the final core mass @xmath15 is normalized to the initial total mass @xmath16 in order to obtain an invariant relation with respect to the scaling properties given in . for a single solitonic core , @xmath106 and @xmath107 as indicated by the black star in the upper right corner .",
    "this point is consistent with since a single core is the limit of infinite mass ratio .",
    "a single core is the ground state solution of the sp system .",
    "it is therefore the point of minimum energy and maximum core mass per total mass .",

    "the fitted final core masses are collectively shown in ( run 3 ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath109 indicating a weaker energy dependence for @xmath77 than for larger mass ratios .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results for binary mergers show consistently that the final core mass does not depend on initial phase difference but only on mass ratio , total initial mass , and total energy of the system .",
    "it depends on angular momentum , relative distance and velocity only via the total energy .     as expected for the outer parts of an nfw profile . ]",
    "in order to study more complex , non - equlibrium problems we follow @xcite and investigate mergers of multiple cores . from our previous analysis we know that the merging time of binaries is negligible with respect to the typical free - fall time .",
    "we can therefore safely assume that a multimerger consists of a series of binary mergers within a deeper gravitational well .",
    "for all runs , we draw halo masses from a gaussian distribution within the @xmath110-band around a chosen average halo mass .",
    "we then place the halos uniformly inside the central numerical domain , rejecting positions that would result in an overlap of halos or close proximity to the outer sponge .",

    ", their central regions can be fitted with a solitonic core profile , , while the tails fall off like @xmath111 consistent with the outer profile of an nfw halo .",
    "the final core masses are summarized in ( run 4 ) .",
    "we can not confirm the @xmath112 scaling shown in @xcite which may in part be a consequence of the fact that , in contrast with their analysis , all results in are normalized to the initial total mass @xmath16 .",
    "this eliminates any scaling with energy originating only from the scale invariance of the sp system , making the results more sensitive to the intrinsic energy dependence of multimergers .",
    "we verified that this discrepancy is unrelated to the initial phase shifts of individual halos .",
    "we presented an investigation of merging solitonic halo cores in full three - dimensional simulations of the schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) equations without assuming any symmetries .",

    "their structure is identical to newtonian oscillaton solutions also known as boson stars .",
    "our results demonstrate a number of robust features of binary core mergers .",
    "qualitatively , bound systems rapidly merge within roughly one oscillation period of the emerging core after approaching to a distance at which the characteristic core radii overlap . it was shown in @xcite that luminous matter can not follow these extreme dynamics and is expelled from the gravitational potential .    during this dynamical phase ,",
    "gravitational cooling is most efficient and essentially determines the loss of mass and angular momentum of the merged core , while continuing to dampen its excitations during the ensuing several oscillation periods .",
    "one exception is the case of perfect phase opposition and equal masses in which case the cores initially repel each other , leading to a bouncing behavior until small accumulated phase differences again cause a rapid merger on a dynamical time scale . owing to the fine tuning required for this situation , we do not consider it relevant in the context of cosmology .",
    "the mass of the emerging core does not directly depend on the binary angular momentum , initial distance , and phase shift between the solitonic cores .",
    "it does depend weakly on their mass ratio and total energy .",
    "the mass of the more massive core can only be enhanced by binary mergers with mass ratio @xmath113 .",
    "otherwise , the smaller core is completely disrupted and forms an nfw - like halo around the more massive one .",
    "neither for the binary mergers nor for the sample of multiple core mergers we were able to reproduce the scaling of core mass with total energy and mass , @xmath112 , reported in @xcite .",
    "after normalizing our results to equal total mass using the scale invariance of the sp equations in order to eliminate spurious scaling behavior , we find no convincing evidence for a universal scaling of core mass with total energy .",
    "more detailed analysis with larger ranges of @xmath102 and @xmath19 and comparison to cosmological simulations of the sp system are needed to further elucidate this discrepancy .",
