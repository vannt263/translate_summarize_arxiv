    "all pure bipartite entangled states violate the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) bell inequality @xcite , by performing appropriate measurements on the subsystem s state . on the other hand , any bell inequality which can be violated in the quantum world ,",
    "can be maximally violated by some pure state and projective ( von neumann ) measurements if no restrictions are put on the underlying hilbert space . however , projective measurements are not the most general measurements .",
    "still , we have found no examples in the literature where general ( so - called povm ) measurements would provide larger violation of some bell inequalities by restricting to a given dimensional state space .",
    "in fact , this concerns a more specific problem posed recently by gisin asking for a state for which povm measurements would perform better than projective ones yielding larger violation of bell inequalities @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the above problems by restricting ourselves to the two - qubit space and to maximally entangled qubits , respectively .",
    "note that in case of two - outcome bell inequalities povms are not better than projective measurements with respect to the amount of bell violation @xcite .",
    "further , in case of all those multiple - outcome bell inequalities we are aware of in the literature , projective measurements still give maximal violation in the specific state space considered ( see e.g. refs  @xcite ) .    on a related note ,",
    "we mention a recent result by cabello and also by nakamura on the kochen - specker theorem @xcite proving that this theorem can be extended to a single qubit if povm measurements can be used instead of only projective ones @xcite . taking this result together with a method of refs .",
    "@xcite for building a @xmath0 pseudo - telepathy game @xcite from a @xmath1-dimensional kochen - specker construction , one may wonder whether this would entail a bell inequality for a system of dimension @xmath2 where povms would give higher violation than projective ones . however , this approach turns out not to be feasible due to the proof of brassard et al .",
    "@xcite , stating that there is no pseudo - telepathy game of dimension @xmath2 even if povms are included .",
    "despite of the above negative results , we manage to derive a bell inequality which proves that povms are relevant with respect to projective measurements for a two - qubit maximally entangled state and also for the case of a two - qubit space .",

    ".  [ bell ] , a parametrized bell inequality is given , for which the quantum bound is calculated either including povm measurements or restricting to projective measurements .",
    "we consider two cases , either the shared state is the two - qubit singlet state ( sec .",
    "[ psiplus ] ) or it may be any state in the two - qubit state space ( sec .  [ twodim ] ) . in section  [ conc ] , we conclude and pose open questions .",
    "let us consider a standard bell scenario @xcite .",
    "two spacelike separated parties , alice and bob , share copies of a quantum state @xmath3 in some dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the two parties can choose among @xmath4 and @xmath5 different measurements which are labelled by @xmath6 for alice and by @xmath7 for bob , where we denote the respective outputs by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in the most general description of a quantum measurement , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) denote the positive operator corresponding to outcome x ( y ) when alice ( bob ) performs measurement a ( b ) .",
    "then the joint conditional probabilities can be calculated in quantum theory by the formula @xmath12 the positive operators above , summing to identity @xmath13 , constitute povms for any inputs @xmath14 .",
    "however , in case of projection measurements , the positive operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 are projectors , hence the ones belonging to the same inputs ought to be orthogonal to each other .    a bell expression is a linear function @xmath15 of the conditional probabilities @xmath16 defined by eq .",
    "( [ pabxy ] ) , where @xmath17 has real components . in order to maximize a bell expression ,",
    "it is enough to consider pure states @xmath18 . in our study",
    ", we will focus on the state space of a pair of qubits , where up to a change of local basis any pure state can be written as @xmath19 .",
    "now , let us take @xmath20 , resulting in the maximally entangled two - qubit state @xmath21 .",
    "then , gisin s problem in ref .",
    "@xcite would be resolved by exhibiting a vector @xmath17 , where the maximum of @xmath22 is achieved with povm measurements ( in contrast to the more restrictive case of projective measurements ) on state @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , we present a bell expression ( called @xmath24 ) , which consists of the ch expression , @xmath25 equivalent to the chsh expression @xcite , and an expression involving on alice s side a 3-outcome measurement ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 resulting in the following bell inequality , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is supposed .",
    "the local bound of 1 is obtained by examining all the deterministic strategies with factorized joint probabilities @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 denote local marginal probabilities on alice and bob s respective sides .",
    "on one hand , we show by analytical means in sec .",
    "[ psiplus ] that povms are required to obtain the optimum value of @xmath24 on @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is shown ( based on numerically exact computations ) in sec .",
    "[ twodim ] that , if we limit the local dimension to two , it is still benefical to perform povm measurements with respect to projective ones .",
    "the above results have implications in the context of dimension witnesses as well @xcite .",
    "a povm is a family of positive operators @xmath33 with elements @xmath34 , which sum to the identity , @xmath35 . in case of qubits",
    ", a bell expression is optimized by pure states and extremal povms , whose elements @xmath34 are proportional to rank-1 projectors @xcite .    for the case of binary outcomes and qubits ,",
    "the extremal povms are projectors parametrized by a unit vector @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the pauli matrices and the probability that outcome @xmath39 occurs for a state @xmath3 is given by born s rule , @xmath40 .",
    "hence , for the maximally entangled state @xmath41 , conditional probabilities  ( [ pabxy ] ) read as @xmath42 and the local marginal probabilities are given by @xmath43 in the above formulae , @xmath44 and @xmath45 label the respective measurement settings of alice and bob parametrized by unit vectors @xmath46 according to eq .",

    "hence we have @xmath51 with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are normalized states . on the other hand , for a three - outcome projective measurement on qubits",

    "let us consider the following optimization problem , which will turn out to play a key role in the construction of the bell inequality @xmath24 defined by ( [ ich3 ] ) .",
    "first , let us define matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 then , we wish to maximize @xmath62 over @xmath63 positive @xmath2 matrices subject to @xmath64 .",
    "hence @xmath34 , @xmath65 can be viewed as povm elements of a three - outcome povm .",
    "let us denote by @xmath66 the maximum of ( [ wopt ] ) obtained in this way . whereas , by further constraining @xmath34 to be projection matrices , we write the respective maximum as @xmath67 . in the following subsections these values",
    "are given explicitly .",
    "the optimization problem in eq .",
    "( [ wopt ] ) with @xmath34 being povm elements is a typical instance of a semidefinite programming problem .",
    "since @xmath68 matrices are real valued , @xmath66 can be obtained with real valued matrices @xmath34 . by solving the sdp problem using the package sedumi @xcite , we obtain @xmath69 the matrices @xmath34 corresponding to this solution obey the positivity and unity conditions up to high precision ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "below , they are written out using less digits ,    @xmath71    @xmath72    and by definition @xmath73 .",
    "as it can be checked , each of these truncated matrices has positive eigenvalues , hence they define a valid povm . by substituting these matrices into the expression @xmath74 in ( [ wopt ] ) ,",
    "we regain the value of @xmath75 in ( [ w ] ) up to 5 digits .",
    "now , let @xmath34 be two - dimensional projection matrices in the optimization problem  ( [ wopt ] ) . according to the ranks of @xmath76 , we have the six possibilities , @xmath58 , listed in sec .",

    "( [ ich3povm ] ) the lower bound on the two - qubit maximum by considering povms is @xmath81 .",
    "this proves the existence of bipartite bell inequalities for which maximal violation on the two - qubit space can be achieved only with the use of generalized povm measurements .",
    "such that povms on a two - qubit werner state @xcite with mixed noise @xmath82 ceases to be better than projective measurements .",
    "the curve gives an analytical lower bound for @xmath82 . ]    note that any bipartite bell inequality consisting of two measurement settings with two outcomes each on bob s side can be maximally violated on the two - qubit space .",
    "this follows from the works of refs .",
    "in particular , due to lemma  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum maximum is achieved by a state with support on bob s qubit . however , using the schmidt decomposition theorem , it induces the composite space to be a pair of qubits , letting alice s state space be a qubit as well . in light of this , @xmath24 is a bell inequality whose maximal violation is attained by performing povm measurements on qubits . on the other hand , if only projective measurements are allowed , then qutrits are needed to achieve maximal violation .",
    "though there are indications that performing povm measurements on a given state or on a given state space may yield benefit over projective ones , the question has not been settled yet . in the present paper",
    "we provide a bipartite bell inequality with a small number of inputs and outputs which answers this question in the positive .",
    "moreover , we found that the improvement , which we defined in terms of noise resistance is not marginal .",
    "it may be within the range of what is feasible experimentally nowadays .    however , one may still wonder whether it would be possible to construct even better bell inequalities with more settings or with more parties allowing a bigger separation in the maximum of bell values achievable with povm versus projective measurements on a given state . a bigger gap might be suggested by the amount of communication to simulate different types of measurements on a singlet state . whereas for projective measurements",
    "one bit of communication suffices @xcite , for povm measurements the best protocol constructed so far needs on average six bits of communication @xcite .",
    "based on the best local models constructed for povms and for projective measurements on a mixture of @xmath1-dimensional maximally entangled states with noise @xcite , it is also plausible that moving from qubits to higher dimensions , povm measurements become much more efficient than projective ones .",
