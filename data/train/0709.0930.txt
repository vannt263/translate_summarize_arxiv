    "when dealing with any kind of mixture the key issue is how to handle the substitutional disorder .",
    "this generic term covers topological disorder , mass disorder , disorder in the bond length , disorder in the bond force constant , etc .",
    "one can choose either a percolation - based approach , which is essentially a mesoscopic one , or a microscopically - averaged description .",
    "in the first case the central notion is the volume fraction of each constituent .",
    "some criticality in the dependence of the physical properties on the composition of the mixture is then expected at the percolation thresholds , where the minor constituent coalesces into a continuum .",
    "percolation approaches are typically used for molecular / natural mixtures , which are of a forbidding complexity at the microscopic scale ( statistical arrangement of molecules or grains with a distribution of sizes and shapes ) , and follow thereby the impetus given in particular by de gennes.@xcite this approach might seem sometimes over - complicated . when facing such kind of ` ideally disordered ' mixtures as conventional semiconductor ( sc ) alloys ab@xmath1c@xmath2 [ simple atoms distributed at random on a quasi - regular lattice , that makes two interpenetrating a and ( b , c ) fcc sublattices ] , one is tempted to proceed as possibly far with microscopic averaging , corresponding then to the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) . with this , each atom a is surrounded by four virtual b@xmath1c@xmath2 atoms , i.e. the crystal is viewed at the _ macroscopic _ scale as a continuum .",
    "the physical properties are accordingly averaged .",
    "no singularity is expected in their dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "actually the vca provides , at first sight , a fairly good description of many properties in sc alloys .    in this work we focus on the bond force constant ( @xmath4 ) in sc alloys .",
    "@xmath4 is sensitive to the overall bond distortion ( bond length plus bond angles ) required to accommodate the mismatch in the a  b and a  c bond lengths  a simple rule states ` _ _ the closer the atoms , the larger @xmath4 _ _ ' , and as such @xmath4 provides a sort of integrated insight into the substitutional disorder .",
    "@xmath4 is routinely probed by raman and infrared ( ir ) spectroscopies via the frequency of the transverse optical ( to ) phonon .",
    "we recall that a transverse ( longitudinal ) optical to ( lo ) mode in the raman / ir spectra corresponds to vibration of the rigid a sublattice against the rigid ( b , c ) sublattice perpendicular to ( along ) the direction of propagation . in a polar crystal",
    "a lo mode differs from a to mode in that it carries a coulombian field @xmath5 due to the ionicity of the bond . in a pure crystal",
    "this is just responsible for an additional restoring force , with the result that a lo mode occurs at a higher frequency than a to mode . in a multi - wave system , such as an alloy ,",
    "the coulombian field @xmath5 is well - known to act as a carrier of coherence,@xcite that makes lo modes a much complicated issue .",
    "in fact , the individual lo modes with close frequencies do @xmath5-couple , which results in a dramatic distortion of the original lo lineshapes.@xcite in contrast , the individual to modes do remain unaltered,@xcite and thereby provide reliable insight into the nature ( via the to - frequency ) and the population ( via the to - intensity ) of the individual oscillators present in the crystal .",
    "so , in the present work we depart from a confusing habit to treat the to and lo modes on an equal footing , and focus most of our attention on to modes .",
    "below , we emphasize accordingly the to aspect in the different models and approaches used throughout the manuscript , to set up a consistent basis for the discussion .",
    "c@xmath6 alloy according to the vca ( a ) and percolation ( b ) approaches .",
    "a simple greyscale code is used . in the alloy",
    "the greyscale reinforces when the local composition becomes more like that of the corresponding pure crystal . a mrei - like correlation with the dependence of the a ",
    "c to - frequency ( @xmath7 ) on the actual alloy composition @xmath3 ( a ) or on re - scaled alloy compositions @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( b ) is emphasized . in case ( b ) critical behaviors occur at the a  c ( @xmath10=0.19 ) and a  b ( @xmath11=0.81 ) bond percolation thresholds . in particular out of the percolation regime a minor region forms a dispersion of clusters with quasi - stable internal structure , as evidenced by a stable grey in scheme ( b ) .",
    "this corresponds to a stable phonon frequency .",
    "the intensity ( @xmath12 ) aspect is also indicated . for",
    "a given a ",
    "c mode this scales as the total fraction of a ",
    "c bond in the alloy ( @xmath3 ) weighted by the scattering volume of the corresponding c - rich ( @xmath3 ) or b - rich ( @xmath13 ) host region .",
    "subscript and superscript b ( c ) refer to the a ",
    "b ( a  c ) bond species and to the pale b - rich ( dark c - rich ) region , respectively .",
    "a similar frequency / intensity description applies to a ",
    "b.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the vca for a bond - related property in a ab@xmath1c@xmath2 alloy , such as the bond force constant @xmath4 , comes to a picture where the bond is immersed into a continuum whose physical properties are smoothly dependent on the alloy composition @xmath3 , as schematically represented in fig .",
    "1a . with this",
    ", the bonds of like species are all equivalent in the alloy , thereby contributing to a unique to mode in the raman / ir spectra .",
    "the intensity scales as the corresponding fraction of bonds , and when x changes the mode shifts regularly between the natural frequency in the pure crystal and the impurity frequency .",
    "no singularity is expected .",
    "such 1-bond@xmath01-mode to behavior is well - accounted for by the modified - random - element - isodisplacement ( mrei ) model as worked out by chang and mitra in the sixties , based on the vca.@xcite in order to grasp the whole behavior , one needs only the frequency of the impurity mode , referred to as @xmath14 below , the to frequency in the pure crystal being normally well - known .",
    "now , a short ( long ) impurity bond is tensed ( compressed ) in a matrix with a large ( small ) lattice constant , which reduces ( enlarges ) @xmath4 , with concomitant impact on @xmath14 ( see the ` rule ' in italics above ) . still , generally @xmath14 remains close to the parent to frequency , because each bond tends to retain its natural bond length in an alloy , as is well - known.@xcite so , the trend in a ` to - frequency vs. @xmath3 ' plot should be that the a - b and a - c to branches do remain quasi - parallel , with slight but finite slopes .",
    "two main types of to mode behavior proceed from the mrei - vca , supporting a corresponding classification of the raman / ir to data : ( @xmath15 ) if the parent to frequencies are much distinct , then the alloy exhibits two well - separated a  b and a ",
    "c to branches , corresponding to a pure 1-bond@xmath01-mode ( 2-mode ) behavior .",
    "( @xmath16 ) if the parent to frequencies are close enough , the a  b and a ",
    "c to branches merge into an apparent 2-bond@xmath01-mode ( mixed - mode ) behavior with a unique ( a  b , a  c)-mixed to mode that has quasi - stable intensity , and shifts regularly between the parent to modes .",
    "there seems to exist a sort of intermediate - type behavior , the so - called ( @xmath17 ) modified - two - mode behavior,@xcite with two ( a  b , a  c)-mixed to modes , i.e. a dominant one of type ( @xmath16 ) , plus a minor one joining the impurity modes that does not allow to fully discard the type ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that while the mrei - vca model fully accounts for types ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) , it fails to account for the type ( @xmath17 ) , even qualitatively .",
    "representative systems are in@xmath1ga@xmath2as , znte@xmath1se@xmath2 and in@xmath1ga@xmath2p , respectively.@xcite the related mrei - vca to schemes are schematically represented in fig .  2 , while approximating the mrei branches to straight lines , for simplicity .",
    "the schemes were built up by using the traditional sets of impurity frequencies : inas : ga@xmath18241  @xmath19 and gaas : in@xmath18237  @xmath19 ( ref . ) , inp : ga@xmath18347  @xmath19 and gap : in@xmath18390  @xmath19 ( ref . ) , and znte : se@xmath18159  @xmath19 and znse : te@xmath18116  @xmath19 ( ref . ) , with the usual notation . in zntese",
    "it is commonly admitted that the impurity modes are screened by the disorder - induced phonon density of states , and thereby do not give rise to any observable feature in the raman / ir spectra.@xcite note that in the mrei ",
    "vca schemes related to ingap and zntese , the basic to branches , as obtained simply by joining the corresponding parent and impurity modes , cross each other ( not shown ) , which contradicts the expected trend of quasi - parallel to branches .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite worked out a theoretical criterion within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to distinguish between type ( @xmath15 ) and type ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "as the cpa is well - suited mainly for the treatment of low concentration of simple defects in otherwise perfect media , the elliott - cpa criterion aims at deriving the whole phonon mode behavior of an alloy from its behavior at the dilute limits .",
    "the criterion predicts type ( @xmath16 ) when the a  b and a  c to  lo bands do overlap in the alloy , type ( @xmath15 ) otherwise . here",
    "the optical bands are simply built up by linear convergence of the parent to and lo frequencies in the pure crystal onto the related impurity frequency .",
    "generally the mrei - vca ( experimental ) and elliott - cpa ( theoretical ) classifications were found to be remarkably consistent , and an exhaustive review of the phonon mode behavior of many ternary alloys in terms of types ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) was proposed by taylor.@xcite a remarkable exception is ingap , whose special raman / ir behavior is not covered by the elliott - cpa criterion .",
    "in fact , the elliott - cpa criterion predicts a type ( @xmath15 ) behavior for ingap , in apparent contradiction with the experimental findings that seem to indicate a strong overlapping of the optical bands in gainp ( see the over - shaded area in fig .",
    "however , careful analysis of the raman / ir data reveals that even the representative alloys we discuss do not fit into the mrei - vca / elliott - cpa classification .",
    "indeed , there are three features in the to raman spectra of ingaas , rather than two ( refer to fig .  3 in ref .  ) . also , the ir spectra of zntese exhibit two clear resonances , not only one ( refer to fig .  1 in ref .  ) . at last ,",
    "the minor to mode of ingap was identified by _ ab initio _ calculations as a pure ga ",
    "p mode , not as a ( in  p , ga  p)-mixed mode ( refer to fig .",
    "3a in ref .  ) .",
    "our view is that the vca misses the essence of the phonon behavior in alloys . recognizing the local character of @xmath4 we conclude that the proper understanding of to phonons requires detailed insight into the topologies of the ( b , c)-substituting species , which falls into the scope of the percolation site theory.@xcite",
    "precisely , the apparent anomalies in inga(as , p ) could be explained within a 1-bond@xmath02-mode percolation model,@xcite introducing a description of a random alloy at the _ mesoscopic _ scale , in terms of a composite made of the b - rich and c - rich regions , both resulting from natural fluctuations in the alloy composition at the local scale .",
    "the whole picture is summarized in fig .",
    "for a given bond , each region brings a specific to mode , the result of different local bond distortions . in a ` to - frequency vs. @xmath3 ' plot , this leads to a splitting of each original mrei - like to branch into a symmetrical double - branch attached at its two ends to the parent and impurity modes .",
    "the intensity of each ` sub - mode ' scales as the total fractions of like bonds in the alloy , i.e. as @xmath20 for a  b and @xmath3 for a ",
    "c , weighted by the scattering volume of the corresponding b - rich ( @xmath13 ) or c - rich ( @xmath3 ) host region .",
    "in particular , singularities in the to -frequency occur at the bond percolation thresholds , where the minor a  b ( @xmath11=0.19 ) and a  c ( @xmath10=0.81 ) bonds become connected throughout the crystal .",
    "this is absent with the mrei - vca .",
    "below the percolation threshold , the minor region consists of a dispersion of finite clusters with similar internal structures , which generates quasi - invariance in the to -frequency ( fractal - like regime ) . above the percolation threshold ,",
    "the finite clusters coalesce into a continuum whose local composition turns smoothly @xmath3-dependent , as does the to frequency ( normal regime ) . there",
    ", a re - scaled mrei approach applies where the continuum is viewed as a pseudo - ternary alloy , and takes an apparent composition that varies from 0 to 1 over its domain of existence ( refer to `` y '' and `` z '' in fig .",
    "basically , two adjustable parameters are required per bond to figure out the whole behavior , i.e. @xmath14  as for the mrei model , plus the splitting @xmath21 between like to modes on the onset of the 2-mode behavior just departing from the impurity limit .    in this work",
    "we investigate whether , among the usual sc alloys , the percolation scheme for inga(as , p ) is fortuitous , i.e. contingent upon the ( ga , in)-substituting species for some reason , or reflects a deeper  universal ",
    "reality by extending further to the representative system of the remaining class ( @xmath16 ) , i.e. zntese .",
    "the perspective is a change of paradigm regarding the way to describe phonons in alloys in general .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we re - examine representative sets of optical phonon frequencies related to znte@xmath1se@xmath2 taken in the literature .",
    "we conclude to a three - oscillator type behavior in the raman / ir spectra , that fits into the 1-bond@xmath02-mode percolation scheme .",
    "a suitable version of the percolation model is derived , supported by independent insight into the impurity modes via existing extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) measurements of the impurity bond lengths .",
    "the ( to , lo ) raman lineshapes are derived in sec .",
    "iii for a clear overview of the phonon mode behavior of zntese .",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "insight into the zone - center to phonon density of states ( zc to - dos ) , that mimics the raman signal , is produced at the stoichiometry ( @xmath3=0.5 ) for comparison . in sec .",
    "iv , we present a unified description of the phonon mode behavior in sc alloys within the percolation scheme , and confront it with the previous mrei - vca / elliott - cpa classification . at",
    "last , in sec .",
    "v , we propose a simple _ ab initio _ ` protocol ' to estimate the input parameters ( @xmath22 , @xmath21 ) of the semi - empirical percolation model .",
    "a priori the prerequisites for the detection of a possible 1-bond@xmath02-phonon behavior seem favorable in znte@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "indeed the lattice mismatch in zntese is similar to that of inga(as , p ) , i.e. @xmath187% , so that similar lattice distortions can be expected , and thereby also similar phonon properties .",
    "further , the dispersion of the to mode is small both in znse ( @xmath186  @xmath19 ) and znte ( @xmath188  @xmath19),@xcite so that even small differences in the local bond distortions may generate fluctuations in the to frequency greater than the dispersion , thereby giving rise to phonon localization , i.e. to well - separated to modes in the raman / ir spectra.@xcite in fact , already three decades ago artamonov _ _ et al.__@xcite mentioned an ` evident analogy ' between the phonon behaviors of ingap and zntese .",
    "later on , yang _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed to reclassify zntese as a type ( @xmath17 ) system , not as a type ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "altogether this suggests that a ingap - like version of the percolation model should apply to zntese .",
    "representative sets of ( to , lo ) frequencies in zntese obtained from raman / ir analysis , as taken in the literature,@xcite are displayed in fig .",
    "3 . as usual@xcite in the discussion of the phonon mode behavior , we focus on the to modes , whereas the discussion on lo modes follows , among some additional details , in sec .",
    "the data indicate three equally spaced to modes in the range 175215  @xmath19 .",
    "we propose a three - oscillator [ 1@xmath23(zn  te ) , 2@xmath23(zn  se ) ] version of the percolation model , with a unique to@xmath24 branch below a well - resolved zn - se to double - branch .",
    "detail is given further on .",
    "in particular the percolation scheme incorporates a general trend that bonds are longer ( shorter ) in environments rich of the shorter ( longer ) bond@xcite  as also evidenced by silverman _ _ et al.__@xcite in ingap by using first - principles calculations  which reduces ( enlarges ) the to frequency .",
    "so , the middle and upper to branches in fig .",
    "3 are attributed to zn ",
    "se vibrations in the se- and te - rich regions , and are accordingly labeled as to@xmath25 and to@xmath26 .",
    "the ( @xmath14 , @xmath21 ) values for the zn  te and zn  se",
    "bonds are estimated as ( @xmath18189  @xmath19 , @xmath180  @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath18195  @xmath19 , @xmath188  @xmath19 ) , respectively , as explained hereafter .",
    "the @xmath14 values were derived by relying on thorough exafs measurements of bond length in zntese.@xcite the shift @xmath27 in the square to frequency of an impurity mode with respect to the corresponding to mode in the pure crystal was inferred from the related difference in bond length @xmath28 via the to mode grneisen parameter @xmath29 of the pure crystal , by using the simple relation@xcite @xmath30 denominators refer to the pure crystal . for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 values related to the zn  se ( zn  te ) bond ,",
    "we have taken 2.6002.643   ( 2.4802.452   ) and 1.7 ( 1.4 ) according to refs .   and , respectively .",
    "for each bond species , the impurity bond length was determined by linear adjustment of the whole ` bond length vs. @xmath3 ' exafs dependence , and extrapolation to the dilute limit .",
    "the whole procedure was earlier tested with ingap , with much success.@xcite    now we turn to @xmath21 .",
    "the lower to - data set is attached to the limit ( @xmath310,1 ) zn  te frequencies at its two ends , indicating an apparent 1-bond@xmath01-mode mrei behavior for the zn  te bond , which comes to @xmath320  @xmath19 .",
    "the two remaining to - data sets share quasi - symmetrically on each side of the limit zn  se frequencies , indicating a well - resolved 1-bond@xmath02-mode type behavior for the zn - se bond , i.e. a finite @xmath33 value .",
    "this was adjusted to @xmath188  @xmath19 by fitting a rescaled - mrei curve to the data in the continuum regime of the dominant to@xmath25 branch at large se content . in this composition",
    "range the to@xmath25 mode shows up strongly in the raman / ir spectra ( see next sec . ) , so that its frequency could be determined with high accuracy .",
    "the remaining pieces of the zn  se double - branch , i.e. the two dispersion regimes ( fractal - like ) plus the rescaled - mrei curve in the continuum regime ( normal ) of the to@xmath26 branch , were directly inferred by symmetry .    in fig .",
    "3 both the to ( thick lines ) and lo ( thin lines ) theoretical curves are in good agreement with the data , in spite of the simplicity of our model .",
    "slight discrepancy exists with respect to the to@xmath26 branch in the te - dilute limit ( less than 8  @xmath19 ) , where the mode becomes weak and hard to detect ( see next sec . ) .",
    "3 all the ingredients are there to calculate the to and lo raman lineshapes of random znte@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "we use the generic equation,@xcite @xmath34 ^ 2 + \\sum_p c_p^{2 } \\frac{k_p^2 l'_p } { 4\\pi z_p^2 }   \\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] in a form restricted to the second member , eq .",
    "( 2 ) gives access to the to modes , while in full it provides the lo modes .",
    "the summation runs over the complete collection of oscillators present in the crystal ; @xmath35 is the relative dielectric function of the whole crystal .",
    "we use a classical form generalized to a discrete series of harmonic oscillators , i.e. three in the present case .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are : the faust  henry coefficient ( which measures the relative raman efficiencies of the to and lo modes ) , the to - frequency squared , and the classical lorentzian response of oscillator @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "@xmath40 is expressed according to the standard mrei terminology,@xcite and relates to the oscillator strength @xmath41 . both @xmath36 and @xmath41 scale as the fraction of oscillator @xmath39 in the crystal .",
    "they are accordingly derived from the ( @xmath36 , @xmath42 , to  lo ) values in the pure znse and znte crystals , taken as ( @xmath430.56 , 5.75 , 206252  @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath430.32 , 7.20 , 176206 @xmath19 ) , respectively . for sake of consistency in the calculations , the faust ",
    "henry coefficients of pure znse and znte were taken from the same source , i.e. corresponding to the ratio of the ionic to electronic parts of the static electro - optic effect,@xcite as calculated by shih _ et al_.@xcite a damping term was introduced in @xmath38 so as to reproduce the finite linewidths of the experimental raman / ir lines .",
    "small dampings were used for the zn  se ( 3  @xmath19 ) and zn  te ( 1  @xmath19 ) modes  for a clear overview of the whole collection of individual oscillators .",
    "care was taken that the latter dampings scale like in the pure crystals , i.e. in the ratio 3:1 , as inferred from the full widths at half maximum of the raman lines obtained in similar conditions with pure znse and znte crystals of the same generation ( see figs 1 in refs   and ) .",
    "the resulting three - mode ( to , lo ) raman lineshapes of znte@xmath1se@xmath2 depending on the alloy composition @xmath3 are displayed in fig .",
    "first we discuss the lo modes ( thin lines in figs 3 and 4 ) . in zntese",
    "the individual lo@xmath24 , lo@xmath25 and lo@xmath26 modes ( not shown ) do @xmath5-couple strongly because the zn  se and zn  te oscillators are so close , which renders the lo situation especially complicated .",
    "basically the available oscillator strength , independently of its origin , i.e. znse- or znte - like , is almost fully channeled into a ` giant ' lo@xmath44 mode at high frequency that has quasi - stable intensity and shifts regularly between the lo modes of the pure znse and znte crystals when the alloy composition changes .",
    "if we abusively apply to lo modes the classification of to -mode behavior outlined in sec .",
    "i , we would say that the lo@xmath44 mode exhibits a model type ( @xmath16 ) behavior .",
    "certainly this is the origin of the mrei - vca attribution of zntese to the type ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "residual lo@xmath45 and lo@xmath46 modes , in the sense of decreasing frequencies , are driven back towards the to modes .",
    "now we turn to the to modes ( thick lines in figs 3 and 4 ) .",
    "we re - assign the presumed unique to mode in the raman / ir spectra of zntese as the sum of close @xmath47 and to@xmath48 modes . in fact the bi - modal character was already obvious in the raman spectra recorded by artamonov _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite the intensities of the two modes in fig .  4 exhibit antagonist variations versus @xmath3 , and become equal at @xmath310.7 , consistently with experimental observations.@xcite an additional minor lo  to inverted oscillator within the main to  lo band , evidenced by ir reflectivity,@xcite is assigned as the lo@xmath45to@xmath26 band .",
    "the lo  to inverted splitting is large at intermediate @xmath3 values , and further increases with ( 1@xmath43@xmath3 ) , as evidenced by burlakov _ _ et al.__@xcite then it vanishes in the te- and se - dilute limits , as observed by yang _ _ et al.__@xcite in brief , all the ` anomalous ' features in the raman / ir spectra of zntese find a natural assignment within the percolation model , on a quantitative basis .",
    "actually , in retrospect there is a quasi - perfect analogy between the phonon mode behaviors of zntese ( this work ) and ingap ( ref .  ) .    to secure a basis of our discussion on to modes we provide independent _ ab initio _",
    "insight into the to density of states ( to - dos ) at the zone - center ( zc , @xmath49=0 ) . in principle",
    "this compares directly to the raman signal , neglecting however polarisability - related variations of intensity of different modes .",
    "we used the following expression for the @xmath49-projected to - dos , @xmath50 where @xmath49 refers to the wavevector , @xmath15 stands for the cartesian coordinates , @xmath51 is the @xmath15-component of the phonon eigenvector for atom @xmath52 at frequency @xmath7 , @xmath53 is the positional vector , and @xmath54 represents an arbitrarily chosen group of atoms ( say , those of a given chemical species ) .",
    "we applied eq .",
    "( 3 ) to a fully - relaxed ( lattice parameter and internal coordinates ) 32-atom supercell at the representative alloy composition @xmath310.5 ( see a drawing in the inset of fig .  4 ) .",
    "care was taken that the se and te atoms distribute in equal proportion over all substituting planes , as is expected in a random alloy .",
    "we apply the plane - wave pseudopotential method within the density functional theory and a linear response technique , using specifically the pwscf method.@xcite the pseudopotentials included zn@xmath55 , se@xmath55 , te@xmath56 as the deepest valence states ; plane wave cutoff of 25 ry , brillouin zone summation done over 2@xmath232@xmath232 @xmath57-points mesh of monkhorst and pack,@xcite and local density approximation ( lda ) used for the exchange - correlation .",

    "as expected , three equidistant oscillators spaced by @xmath1810  @xmath19 , with similar intensities , show up , i.e. a znte - like below two znse - like ones ( refer to the arrows ) .",
    "an overall blue - shift of the zc to - dos with respect to the raman signal ( @xmath1820  @xmath19 ) is due to a well - known overbinding in lda .",
    "we have checked that the interplay between the frequencies and intensities of the three oscillators in the zc to - dos are consistent with the general trend in the to symmetry as displayed in the body of fig .  4 , over the entire composition domain .",
    "the percolation schemes for ingaas , ingap ( see ref .  ) and zntese are schematically reproduced in fig .",
    "5 . these were built up from the experimental ( @xmath22 , @xmath21 ) values reported in table 1 .",
    "only the to branches are shown , for clarity , while simplifying the rescaled - mrei oblique segments to straight lines .",
    "there is an obvious analogy between the three schemes , indicating that the traditional mrei - vca / elliott - cpa classification has , in fact , no _",

    "this is consistent with the elliott - cpa classification of inga(as , p ) and zntese as types ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) , respectively .",
    "the percolation schemes are also consistent with the mrei - vca classification .",
    "it is just a matter of regrouping close individual / double to branches as shown by ovals in fig .",
    "the usual terminology of separate modes [ type ( @xmath15 ) , fig .",
    "5a ] , dominant - plus - minor modes [ type ( @xmath17 ) , fig .",
    "5b ] and mixed - mode [ type ( @xmath16 ) , fig .",
    "5c ] comes out naturally .",
    "note that in the percolation schemes the individual to branches all remain quasi - parallel , as ideally expected .",
    "a probable reason why differences in the detail of the phonon behaviors of ingaas , ingap and zntese were previously mistaken for differences in the principles of the phonon mode behaviors lies in an implicit , but wrong , assumption that the to and lo modes behave similarly in an alloy . in the lo symmetry",
    "a strong @xmath5-coupling occurs in particular between the like lo modes that come from the same double - branch , because these refer to the same bond species and as such have close frequencies in general .",
    "the result is that the actual 1-bond@xmath02-mode behavior visible in the to symmetry , supporting a description of the phonon mode behavior at the _ mesoscopic _ scale on a percolation basis , is literally rubbed out in the lo symmetry .",
    "what is left is an apparent lo behavior , encouraging a more crude description at the _ macroscopic _ scale according to the mrei - vca . due to this",
    "to vs. lo difference in nature , any attempt to explain the to and lo modes in an alloy on the same intuitive basis is damned to fail .",
    "simplicity arises by focusing on to modes ; lo modes follow .",
    "to complete the picture , we give in this section a simple _ ab initio _ ` protocol ' to estimate the basic input parameters of our semi - empirical percolation model , i.e. ( @xmath22 , @xmath21 ) per bond .",
    "the ` protocol ' operates at the impurity - dilute limits , for two reasons .",
    "first , it is attractive conceptually to be in a position to derive the whole raman / ir behavior of an alloy from its behavior in the dilute limits .",
    "incidentally , the elliott s criterion proceeds from a similar ambition .",
    "second , placing the analysis at the dilute limits brings in a decisive advantage that the number of motifs is much restricted for the impurity atoms .",
    "then , it is just a matter to identify those motifs that are suitable for our purpose .",
    "further , at the impurity limit a rather small - size supercell will do , in which case a full _ ab initio _ approach can be pursued . beyond the impurity limit , we would face a necessity to incorporate the whole statistics of the alloy disorder , averaging over a big number of large - size supercells .",
    "almost invariably that would mean employing a simplified ( e.g. an empirical valence force field ) method to perform structure relaxations .",
    "such calculations have been done , e.g. in refs and .",
    "our ` protocol ' is based on _ ab initio _ bond length / phonon calculations in prototype 64-atom ( 2@xmath232@xmath232-replicated simple cubic ) supercells of zincblende structure , with either one or two nearest cation ( or anion ) sites substituted by a different species .",
    "calculation of zone - center phonons was preceded by unconstrained ( lattice parameter and atom positions ) relaxation for each supercell .",
    "in particular the sufficiency of the supercell size for our purpose of treating impurity pairs can be supported by the following arguments .",
    "first , some of us checked the falling down of interatomic force constants in semiconductor alloys with distance , and found that the interactions beyond the second neighbors can be safely discarded , without noticeable differences in the phonon spectra.@xcite in our supercell with an impurity pair , none of the second neighbors of an impurity is simultaneously a second neighbor to a spurious ( translated ) impurity .",
    "second , even with the break of symmetry introduced by an impurity pair , the relaxed shape of the supercell remains remarkably cubic .",
    "finally teweldeberhan _ et al_.@xcite who were confronted with a similar problem of _ ab initio _",
    "( bond length ) calculations related to chosen ( in , n ) motifs in the highly - dilute ( in , n)-impurity limit of in@xmath58ga@xmath59as@xmath1n@xmath2 have observed that the 64-atom supercell calculation is well - converged in size for such purpose , i.e. the 64-atom supercell seems sufficient to reproduce the behavior of the considered motif as immersed in the infinite solid .",
    "the lda calculations have been done in part ( zntese ) with the pwscf method,@xcite as stated above , and in part ( ingaas , ingap ) with siesta,@xcite which relies on norm - conserving pseudopotentials and strictly confined atom - centered numerical basis functions . the basis sets ( from as@xmath55 , ga@xmath55 upwards ) were of ` double - zeta with polarization orbitals ' quality .",
    "brillouin zone integration demanded at least 2@xmath232@xmath232-mesh in the @xmath57-space , in order to get convergence of phonon frequencies with respect to this parameter .    to access @xmath22 we use a supercell containing a single impurity ( @xmath183% imp . ) .",
    "this is the ultimate configuration that refers to an impurity in the region rich of the other substituting species , i.e. the dominant one .",
    "we search for the impurity bond length and estimate the difference @xmath60 with respect to the bond length in the pure crystal .",
    "eventually @xmath61 is derived via @xmath29 by using eq .",
    "the directly calculated impurity frequency @xmath62 is not necessary at this stage as it might be subject to systematic shift , due to the effective overbinding caused by the lda .",
    "the as - obtained @xmath22 values for ingaas , ingap and zntese fairly agree with the experimental ones , as shown in table  1 , which validates this part of the ` protocol ' .    to access @xmath21",
    ", we use a supercell containing two neighboring substitutional impurities .",
    "this pair forms the germ of the impurity - rich region , i.e. the ultimate configuration that refers to an impurity staying in its own environment .",
    "we search for the frequency of the softer impurity - related phonon mode ( see detail further on ) , referred to as @xmath63 , and @xmath21 is estimated as @xmath64 . the systematic error due to lda",
    "is thus eliminated .",
    "( one of the two input parameters of the percolation model ) , as indicated by the antagonist arrows .",
    "the notation ` @xmath65 ' indicates a parasitical vibration mode out of the center of the brillouin zone . in the inset , the zc to - dos per atom due to the isolated be impurity ( upper curve ) and to",
    "the be impurity pair ( lower curve ) in znse are shown , for reference purpose.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    a choice system to test the ` protocol ' with respect to @xmath21 is the random zn@xmath1be@xmath6se alloy , that exhibits an unequally well - resolved 1-bond@xmath02-mode raman behavior in the be  se spectral range.@xcite we report in the inset of fig .",
    "6 the zc to - dos curves per - atom related to the single be impurity ( lower curve ) and to the be impurity pair ( upper curve ) . by forming the pair , the original triply degenerate impurity mode splits into two , a doubly - degenerate mode at a slightly higher frequency corresponding to anti - phase be and se vibrations transverse to the be - se chain ( in - plane and out - of - plane ones ) , and a minor one , red - shifted by @xmath1840  @xmath19 ( the softer pair - related phonon mode mentioned above ) , due to similar vibrations but along the chain , i.e. longitudinal ones then .",
    "somewhat ideally , a similar shift @xmath21 of @xmath1840  @xmath19 is observed between the two like be - se raman modes at small be content.@xcite only , the theoretical features are globally blue - shifted by @xmath1835  @xmath19 , due to the effective overbinding in lda .",
    "now we apply the same procedure to zntese . the zc to - dos due to the isolated impurity ( thin lines ) and to the impurity pair ( thick lines ) at both the se- ( upper curves ) and te - dilute ( lower curves ) limits are shown in the body of fig .  6 .",
    "the zc to - dos due to the dominant substituting species ( shaded areas ) are added for complementary insight into the reference to mode of the host lattice .",
    "again , the theoretical curves are globally blue - shifted ( by @xmath1820  @xmath19 ) with respect to the raman / ir features , due to the lda . at the se - dilute limit ,",
    "two well - resolved pair - impurity ( se ) modes show up with the isolated - impurity ( se ) mode in - between , as in the reference znbese system . the host - lattice ( te ) mode",
    "is situated just below .",
    "the low - frequency pair - impurity mode is red - shifted by @xmath666  @xmath19 with respect to the isolated - impurity mode .",
    "note that the dominant contribution in the zc to - dos of the isolated se impurity does not refer to a pure zc mode .",
    "indeed we have checked that the impurity se atom does not vibrate against the whole cage of its zn first - neighbors , two out of four zn atoms remain quasi - immobile . at the te - dilute limit , the pair - impurity ( te ) modes , transverse and longitudinal to the te - zn - te chain , do nearly degenerate into a single mode situated at the same frequency as the isolated - impurity ( te ) mode , corresponding to @xmath660  @xmath19 .",
    "the host - lattice ( se ) mode is located at a slightly higher frequency .",
    "these are precisely the limit ( isolated impurity , impurity - pair , host lattice ) configurations that we expect at @xmath31(0,1 ) from fig .",
    "similar insight into the @xmath21 values of in@xmath1ga@xmath2as and in@xmath1ga@xmath2p is detailed in ref .  .",
    "the @xmath21 values obtained via the ` protocol ' for ingaas , ingap and zntese are compared to the experimental ones in table  1 .",
    "again , the agreement is rather good , which validates the second part of the ` protocol ' .",
    "for sake of completeness we mention also a similar procedure in the n - dilute limit of the _ non - random _",
    "gaas@xmath1n@xmath2 alloy.@xcite again the contrast in the bond length / stiffness of the two constituent species is large , even larger than in znbese , which provides a large @xmath21 value for the ga - n bond . the theoretical estimate @xmath6650  @xmath19 compares reasonably well to the experimental value of @xmath1840  @xmath19 , as inferred from the raman spectra .",
    "note that in this highly - contrasted system the fine structure of the zc to - dos in the spectral region of the isolated n impurity and of the harder mode of the n - impurity pair is completely resolved , i.e. the in - plane and out - of - plane transverse modes of the impurity pair are no more degenerate .",
    "together with the _ ab initio _ ` protocol ' our semi - empirical percolation model gives a self - sufficient tool for an insight into the vibration spectra of , in principle , any zincblende alloy .",
    "in summary , by putting an emphasis on to modes  as opposed to lo modes  as the proper way to get reliable insight into the whole complexity of the phonon mode behavior of an alloy , we show that zntese obeys the 1-bond@xmath02-phonon percolation model , as ingaas and ingap do .",
    "we propose a three - oscillator [ 1@xmath23(zn  te ) , 2@xmath23(zn  se ) ] version , independently supported by existing exafs data and home - made _ ab initio _ phonon / bond length calculations .",
    "this leads to unification of the traditional mrei - vca / elliott - cpa classification into a single class covered by the percolation model .",
    "also , this work reveals that to - based vibrational spectroscopies provide natural insight ( non destructive and contactless ) into the alloy disorder at the unusual mesoscopic scale , which is hardly achieved otherwise .",
    "in particular , this offers an attractive perspective for the study of the long scale ( self ) organization in alloys , be it local ordering@xcite or anti - clustering.@xcite at last we propose a simple _ ab initio _ ` protocol ' at the dilute - impurity limits to estimate the input parameters of the semi - empirical percolation model for the calculation of the raman / ir spectra of a random zincblende alloy . with this , the model becomes self - sufficient . more generally , what emerges is that sc alloys can not escape a description of some of their very basic physical properties via a percolation concept . as such , they do not differ fundamentally from the considerably more complex molecular / natural mixtures .",
