    "all recent studies indicate that there is no dynamically significant amount of disk dark matter at the solar position , although a small fraction ( @xmath110% ) can not be ruled out . in order to derive the dynamical mass surface density , the usual way to proceed",
    "is to consider a tracer of the potential , such as k giant stars or hi gas . in principle , ideal tracers are old enough ( age @xmath2 gyr ) that they are expected to be well mixed into the galactic potential , so that they satisfy the virial condition . in a recent paper ,",
    "garrido pestaa & eckhardt ( 2010 ) ( hereafter gpe ) compare the kinetic energy @xmath3 of stellar and gaseous components in the local galactic disk , to their gravitational energy @xmath4 , and conclude that the vertical configuration is not in a state of equilibrium because @xmath5 and , therefore , the classical poisson - boltzmann approach used to interpret the data is an inappropriate and futile exercise . if the energy in vertical random motions is a factor of @xmath0 larger than in virial equilibrium , the local portion of the disk should be in a phase of violent relaxation . under such conditions ,",
    "the thickness of the disk would inflate by a factor of @xmath6 on average ( see section [ sec : steady ] ) after just a few vertical crossing times ( @xmath7 years ) .",
    "it is unlikely that we would be observing the disk at a time just prior to such a violent event , and if we were , the classical view that the disk thickening is due to slow dynamical heating due to encounters with massive molecular clouds , spiral arms and gravitational perturbations caused by minor mergers , should change dramatically . in this paper ,",
    "we show , however , that there is no reason for abandoning the assumption that the vertical configuration is in a steady state .",
    "consider a rotationally symmetric disk stratified in the @xmath8-direction , where @xmath9 is the disk plane of symmetry , and composed of @xmath10 components in equilibrium . each component , either if it is collisionless ( stars and dark matter ) or collisional ( gas ) , satisfies a boltzmann equation .",
    "the vertical jeans equations can be combined to obtain : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vertical velocity dispersion of the component @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the gravitational potential and @xmath15 . for gaseous components , @xmath16 is the effective velocity dispersion , which includes the pressure support by turbulent motions , magnetic fields and cosmic rays . in a real galaxy ,",
    "gradients in the radial and azimuthal directions generate nondiagonal terms of the velocity dispersion tensor , i.e.  @xmath17 and @xmath18 , in the vertical jeans equation . at @xmath19 kpc , the fractional corrections due to the cross terms are less than @xmath20 and",
    "are usually ignored except when studying stars at @xmath21 kpc ( e.g. , bahcall 1984 ; olling 1995 ; becquaert & combes 1997 ; kalberla 2003 ; moni bidin et al .",

    "following gpe , we start by considering a infinite plane - parallel layer of total column density @xmath22 in equilibrium with its own gravity . by choosing the zero of the potential at @xmath9 and multiplying the above equation by @xmath8 and integrating over @xmath8 , one obtains the virial theorem , linking the kinetic and gravitational energies with surface terms .",
    "if the surface terms are null at @xmath23 , the relationship is @xmath24 , where @xmath4 and @xmath3 are the gravitational and kinetic energies ( due to vertical motions ) , respectively , per surface unit in the disk in this case .",

    ", it holds that @xmath32 is exactly @xmath33 , whereas it is slightly different from @xmath33 for a gaussian density profile in equilibrium ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "gpe argue that @xmath35 and evaluate the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : garpes ] ) for the galactic disk at the solar position and find that it has the value @xmath36 . since this is a factor of @xmath37 larger than required if the virial equilibrium is to hold , they conclude that the disk at the solar position is not in a steady - state vertical configuration and potential energy @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the kinetic plus gravitational energies . in the initial nonequilibrium configuration , @xmath41 . equating the energy",
    ", we find that @xmath42 .",
    "since the scaleheight scales roughly as @xmath4 , the disk will become thicker by a factor of @xmath6 . ] .    in the following",
    ", we will check the robustness of the assumption that @xmath35 . to do so ,",
    "we start by integrating equation ( [ eq:1stboltzmann ] ) from the midplane to a certain distance @xmath8 above the midplane and obtain : @xmath43 for a system such that the volume density of kinetic energy decays to zero at large @xmath8 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure ] ) becomes @xmath44 and tell us that the total pressure at the midplane must be in balance with the weight of all the material above @xmath9 .    in the particular case of a stratified plane - parallel layer ,",
    "all the variables depend only on @xmath8 .",
    "integration of the poisson equation allows us to find the vertical acceleration .",
    "if the layer is confined by its own gravity , the vertical acceleration for @xmath45 reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 is defined for @xmath45 as @xmath48 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pressure_midplane ] ) and ( [ eq : verticalforce ] ) , and using the relation @xmath49 we find @xmath50 which can be expressed as @xmath51 note that the above equation is _ exact _ for a plane - parallel layer in equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the total pressure at @xmath9 ( not @xmath52 as stated in gpe ) divided by @xmath53 must be @xmath33 in a steady - state plane - parallel layer .",
    "gpe analysis applied to a plane - parallel layer is strictly correct only if @xmath54 .",
    "we will see later that this equality does not hold in a multicomponent disk .    in a real galaxy ,",
    "not only the disk but also other components ( such as the dark matter halo ) contribute to the vertical confinement of stars in the thin and thick disks .",

    "evaluation of @xmath71 ( not including the stellar halo ) in the updated disk model of holmberg & flynn ( 2004 ) reported in table 2 of flynn et al .",

    "taking the total surface density in disk components of @xmath76pc@xmath75 , the left - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : exact_eq ] ) is @xmath77 .",

    "( [ eq : exact_eq ] ) at @xmath78 kpc and find that it is @xmath79 , which is only @xmath80 smaller than the left - hand - side .",
    "this simple estimate indicates that the disk model of flynn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is very close to satisfying the virial theorem . in order to assess",
    "if this difference of ten percent is significant , we have calculated @xmath81 in the model of flynn et al .",

    "we confirmed that the disk model fulfills the virial condition .    why did gpe obtain that the disk models by bahcall et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and flynn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) do not comply with the virial theorem ?",
    "it was a consequence of the combination of three factors : ( 1 ) they adopted @xmath82 , which is in error by a factor of @xmath83 ( see below ) , ( 2 ) the stellar halo was treated as a disk component , which introduces an additional artificial factor of @xmath84 and ( 3 ) the contribution of the dark halo in the vertical confinement of disk stars was not taken into account . as a consequence , the ratio between kinetic and gravitational energies was overestimated by a factor of @xmath0 .    for a stratified plane - parallel self - gravitating layer ,",
    "it is true that @xmath25 in virial equilibrium .",

    "in fact , the form of the left - hand - side of the equilibrium condition used in gpe ( eq .  [ eq : garpes ] ) can be preserved by introducing a `` correction '' factor @xmath85 on the right - hand - side : @xmath86 with @xmath87 the value of @xmath85 depends on the vertical structure of the disk . for a single gaussian ( non - isothermal ) density profile in @xmath8 , @xmath88 , and hence @xmath34 , as reported in gpe . however , for the @xmath89th - components of the updated disk model of holmberg & flynn ( 2004 ) , the @xmath85-value in the virial theorem criterion for a state of equilibrium is @xmath83 and thus @xmath90 . to be more precise",
    ", we adopted the values of @xmath91 and @xmath16 for the @xmath89th - components of flynn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and solved the poisson - boltzmann equation for such a disk with no dark halo , in order to compare with gpe analysis on a common ground .",
    "we obtain @xmath92pc@xmath73 , @xmath93pc@xmath75 , @xmath94 km s@xmath65 and @xmath95",
    ". _ therefore , gpe analysis applied to the infinite plane - parallel multicomponent layer overestimates the @xmath96 ratio by a factor of @xmath97 because _ @xmath98",
    "in the last section we have shown that the virial theorem is satisfied for the galactic disk models under consideration .",
    "however , the virial theorem is a relation between global quantities and is not a guarantee that the system is in a steady - state equilibrium . in order to dispel any doubt ,",
    "we have tested the temporal stability of the type of disks considered here using n - body simulations , in which stars are initially set up in a one - dimensional density and velocity distribution , based on solutions to the poisson - boltzmann equation , after which we calculate their vertical motions under the gravitational force generated by the overall density distribution of the disk .    at each time step in the simulation , the downward acceleration at height @xmath8 above the disk , is found by integrating numerically the density profile of all the stars ( eq .  [ eq : verticalforce ] ) to absolute height @xmath99 .",
    "a leap - frog integrator is then used to compute new positions and velocities for the particles , and the process repeated .",
    "we keep track of the velocity dispersion , scale height and other quantities for the ensemble , to check if it is in vertical equilibrium or not .",
    "three disk types were considered .",
    "firstly , we looked at an `` isothermal disk '' , in which the initial conditions are a sech@xmath100 distribution in density ( with a scale height @xmath101 ) and a ( constant ) velocity dispersion @xmath102 , given by by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the disk central density .",
    "the density distribution in such a disk is given by @xmath105sech@xmath106 .",
    "we adopt @xmath107 m@xmath108 pc@xmath73 and @xmath101",
    "= @xmath109 pc , implying a total disk surface density of 50 m@xmath108 pc@xmath75 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath110 km s@xmath65 .",
    "these are similar to the measured values for the local galactic disk .",
    "secondly , we looked at an `` exponential disk '' , in which the density distribution is given by @xmath111exp@xmath112 ) , and the velocity dispersion is a function of @xmath8 , being smaller close to the midplane and rising asymptotically to a constant value at large height . the velocity dispersion @xmath102 is given by @xmath113 adopting a scaleheight of @xmath114 pc and a central density of @xmath115 pc@xmath73 , this disk has a surface density of 50 @xmath116 pc@xmath75 , like the isothermal disk .",
    "the central velocity dispersion for this disk rises from @xmath117 km s@xmath65 at @xmath9 to @xmath118 km s@xmath65 at large @xmath8 .",
    "the simulations of these two disks were run with 10 million particles , for @xmath119 gyr , over 1 myr time steps .",
    "this time step was found to be a good compromise between the length of the runs and the accuracy of the orbits .",
    "note that the oscillation time for stars in the tested potentials is typically @xmath120 to @xmath121 myr .",
    "both disks are completely self - gravitating , with the gravitational field provided by the density distribution of the particles alone .    over @xmath119 gyr ,",
    "the central density , mean velocity dispersion and scaleheights of the simulated disks remain within a few percent of their initial values .",
    "thus , the exponential disk and the isothermal disk are found to be stationary in the simulations .",
    "furthermore , this is what we expect , since gpe s analysis shows that , for both simulated disks , the virial equilibrium condition is met very precisely .",
    "thus , no long term secular evolution is expected for either disk , and this we fully confirm with the simulations .",
    "we then simulated the much more complex system , consisting of all components , stellar and gaseous , of the disk in flynn et al .",
    "this disk consists of 14 isothermal components , with a range of central densities and ( isothermal ) velocity distributions .",
    "the stellar halo , which is the 15th component of the flynn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) disk model , is ignored ( including it in the solutions is found to have no effect on the disk stability , but we focus in the following on disk components only ) .",
    "the gaseous components are modelled as collisionless particles , just like the stars , since the aim is to test the poisson - boltzmann solution , which implicitly makes this assumption .",
    "we also include the effect of the halo dark matter in these simulations , not by simulating it with particles , but by adding it in to the computation of the vertical force as an extra density term ( as a function of @xmath8 ) .    the simulation is run with 10 million particles for a period of 5 gyr with time steps of 1 myr .",
    "energy conservation in the simulation is better than @xmath122 percent .",
    "we find that this complex disk is also stationary .",
    "the density and velocity distributions of the particles after 5 gyr are very similar to their initial distributions , and so no large scale secular evolution takes place .",
    "if this rather complex disk were substantially out of equilibrium initially , we would expect rapid evolution in these quantities .",
    "figure [ fig : hfhalo ] shows the results .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the evolution of kinetic energy ( dotted line ) , potential energy ( dashed line ) and total energy ( solid line ) over the 5 gyr of the simulation .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the total velocity dispersion as a function of time . in panels ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , we show the initial ( circles ) and final ( crosses ) density and velocity distributions of the particles as a function of @xmath8 height . the initial and final distributions are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "panel ( e ) shows the time evolution of the central density , and panel ( f ) the scale height ( @xmath101 , of an exponential fit to the density profile , measured from the midplane to @xmath123 pc ) .",
    "none of the plots show any significant evolution in these quantities with time .",
    "we conclude from the simulations that the flynn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) model disk is indeed in equilibrium , as we concluded from theoretical analysis in the previous section , and contrary to the claims in gpe .    in order to illustrate the role of the dark halo in confining the disk , we rerun the simulation but the dark halo contribution to the force",
    "was turned off so that the disk is not in equilibrium initially .",
    "figure [ fig : unbalanced ] shows that the disk relaxes dynamically ( particularly those stars in the thick disk ) to a stationary state in @xmath124 gyr . panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the typical behaviour of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath29 in a relaxing process .",
    "as can be seen from panels ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) , the disk becomes thicker and colder .",
    "panel ( f ) shows the temporal evolution of @xmath125 and @xmath32 . since all the gravity",
    "is provided by the stars and the gas only , virial theorem for this system dictates that @xmath25 .",
    "we see that @xmath126 in the steady - state .",
    "we have examined the claim by gpe that solutions for the density distribution of matter in the local galactic disk are seriously in error because such solutions are not in virial equilibrium .",
    "gpe claim that the ratio between the kinetic and the gravitational energy in such disks is a factor of @xmath0 larger than required for virial equilibrium to hold .",
    "we have shown that this ratio between energies was overerestimated by gpe because ( 1 ) they assumed that @xmath82 , ( 2 ) the stellar halo was treated as a disk component and ( 3 ) the vertical confinement provided by the dark halo was ignored .",
    "taking into account these corrections , the local disk model of flynn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is likely to be in virial equlibrium after all .",
    "our technique could easily be applied to any such model ( e.g. , bahcall et al .",
    "1992 ; just & jahreiss 2010 ) and yield a similar result .",
    "simulations of the oscillation of stars in model disks show that the initial distribution of the stars in density and velocity space are stationary , backing up our theoretical analysis .",
