    "the poissonian statistics of stellar populations in each pixel of a galaxy image produces fluctuations . while the mean flux per pixel does not depend on distance",
    ", the variance of these fluctuations is inversely proportional to the square of the galaxy distance . when properly calibrated this variance can then be used as a distance indicator .",
    "surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) are defined as the variance of the flux of the fluctuations normalized to the mean flux of the galaxy in each pixel @xcite . the stars that contribute the most to the sbf are then the brightest stars in the intrinsic luminosity function , typically red giants in old stellar populations ( a recent review on the method has been given by blakeslee et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "i  band sbf have being used successfully to measure elliptical and s0 distances up to 4000 km s@xmath5 from ground based telescopes and 7000 km s@xmath5 on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "recently sbf measurements have been attempted in the infrared k ",
    "band for several reasons @xcite .",
    "first of all the contrast between brightest red giants and the underlying stellar populations is more extreme in the k  band , producing larger sbf at any given distance .",
    "second , at ground facilities , k  band seeing is intrinsically better than i  band seeing which also enhances the sbf contrast .",
    "moreover the color contrast between k  band sbf and external sources ( globular clusters and background galaxies ) is larger than in the i  band .",
    "finally both empirical and theoretical studies suggest that absolute k  band sbf is almost constant with age for solar - metallicity stellar populations @xcite .",
    "these arguments suggest that in the infrared it should be possible to determine sbf distances for galaxies at larger distances than at optical wavelengths @xcite . however , the k - band has one major disadvantage for ground - based studies - the background is significantly brighter making it much more difficult to detect and correct for globular cluster and background galaxy contamination and increasing the background shot noise .",
    "initial k - band sbf studies suggested that the @xmath4 varied very little from galaxy - to - galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , these studies also argued that two virgo ellipticals ( ngc 4365 and ngc 4489 ) had significantly brighter than average @xmath6 values suggesting the presence of an extended giant branch .",
    "this conclusion , however , was weakened by two problems : ( 1 ) no correction was made for globular cluster and background galaxy contamination ; and ( 2 ) the sbf measurements were based on relatively low signal - to - noise data .",
    "jensen et al . (",
    "1998 ) re - measured @xmath2 for ngc 4365 , using i - band data to determine a correction for globular cluster contamination , and concluded that ngc 4365 was a member of the background w cloud and the @xmath2 for this galaxy was consistent with other virgo ellipticals .",
    "in short , ngc 4365 appears to have a normal giant branch .",

    "<S> relative to the average empirical @xmath2 derived for giant ellipticals by jensen et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1998 ) ( @xmath3 ) , the detection of an anomalous k - band sbf in ngc 4489 is confirmed at the two sigma level . </S>",
    "<S> such anomalous fluctuations could be caused by an extended giant branch , consisting of either intermediate - age agb stars above the tip of the first - ascent giant branch or high - metallicity first - ascent giants , or by lack of a full understanding of the k  band sbf calibration . </S>",
    "<S> this result raises questions about the accuracy of k - band sbf distance measurements for elliptical galaxies with unknown stellar composition and underscores the need for @xmath4 measurements over a larger range of color and luminosity . </S>"
