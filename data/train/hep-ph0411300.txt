    "the predictive power of the parton model of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) lies in the factorization theorem . in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) ,",
    "factorization in short- and long - distance parts allows us to describe the observed cross sections of inclusive hadron production as a convolution of the partonic cross sections with non - perturbative parton density functions ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) @xcite .",
    "single - hadron inclusive production in electron - proton dis , @xmath1 occurs partonically already in the absence of strong interactions , at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the strong - coupling constant , when one parton of the proton ( a quark ) interacts with the lepton current and fragments into the hadron @xmath4 ( nave parton model ) .",
    "if the virtuality @xmath5 of the four - momentum transfer @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9-boson mass , then process  ( [ eqep ] ) is essentially mediated by a virtual photon ( @xmath10 ) , while the contribution from @xmath9-boson exchange is negligible . in the following ,",
    "this is the situation we are interested in .",
    "since we are interested in perturbative qcd effects , we require the hadron to carry non - vanishing transverse momentum ( @xmath11 ) in the centre - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame of the virtual photon and the incoming proton . at leading order ( lo ) ,",
    "the corresponding partonic subprocesses thus contain two partons in the final state , one of which fragments into the hadron , while the other one balances the transverse momentum . at next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    ", three - parton final states contribute to the real correction , while the virtual correction arises from one - loop diagrams with two final - state partons .",
    "the investigation of single - hadron production is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first of all , it provides a test of perturbative qcd and of factorization .",
    "apart from the partonic cross sections obtainable from perturbative qcd , the theoretical predictions essentially depend on universal pdfs and ffs .",
    "in particular , the ffs , which are fitted to electron - positron - annihilation data , may be tested with regard to their universality .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical predictions allow for a direct comparison with experimental data , without resorting to any kind of monte carlo model to simulate the hadronization of the outgoing partons .",
    "thus , we may expect very meaningful results .",
    "moreover , the theoretical predictions are directly sensitive to the gluon pdf of the proton with the potential to constrain the latter .    on the experimental side ,",
    "precise data were collected by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at the @xmath12 collider hera at desy .",
    "they refer to @xmath13 mesons in the forward region @xcite , with small angles with respect to the proton remnant , and to charged hadrons @xcite .",
    "more than 25 years ago , the cross section of process  ( [ eqep ] ) with finite transverse momentum of the hadron @xmath4 was calculated by mndez @xcite at lo , to @xmath14 . since qcd corrections are typically large and we are confronted with precise experimental data , it is desirable to compare these data with predictions of at least nlo accuracy , including the terms of @xmath15 . for this purpose ,",
    "a first nlo qcd prediction was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , neglecting the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the virtual photon .",
    "the theoretical description can be rendered more reliable by resumming the leading logarithmic contributions of the perturbation expansion . in this sense , the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite and dokshitser - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite equations resum at lo the @xmath16 and @xmath17 contributions , respectively , where @xmath18 is the bjorken variable and @xmath19 is the cut - off scale for the perturbative evolution .",
    "disregarding the fact that these resummations are just approximations , they evidently fail in the kinematic regions of large @xmath18 values and small @xmath20 values , respectively .    in this paper , we perform a full nlo qcd calculation , also taking into account the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the virtual photon .",
    "we encounter ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) singularities , which we all regularize using dimensional regularization . in order to overcome the difficulties in connection with the ir singularities emerging in different parts of the nlo correction",
    ", we employ the dipole subtraction formalism @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the more conventional phase - space slicing method , there is no need to introduce any unphysical parameter to cut the phase space into soft , collinear , and hard regions .",
    "moreover , all cancellations of ir singularities occur before any numerical phase - space integration is performed .",
    "we thus conveniently obtain numerically stable predictions .",
    "an independent calculation was recently presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the matrix elements of the hard - scattering processes were adopted from the disent program package  @xcite . in ref .",

    ", we have to compute the virtual and real corrections of @xmath15 to the hadron tensors .",
    "we then encounter a rather involved pattern of singularities .",
    "all these singularities are regularized using dimensional regularization with @xmath66 space - time dimensions yielding poles in @xmath67 in the physical limit @xmath68 .",
    "the integrations over the loop four - momenta in the virtual correction lead to uv and ir singularities , where the ir ones comprise both soft and collinear singularities .",
    "all uv singularities are removed through the renormalizations of the wave functions and the strong - coupling constant .",
    "the remaining soft and collinear singularities cancel partly against counterparts originating from the phase - space integration of the real correction .",
    "the remaining collinear poles have to be factorized into the bare pdfs and ffs so as to render them finite .",
    "the virtual correction is obtained as the interference of the born and one - loop matrix elements .",
    "the latter receive contributions from self - energy , triangle , and box diagrams .",
    "these involve two- , three- , and four - point tensor integrals , which are reduced to scalar integrals via tensor reduction @xcite .",
    "the scalar integrals contain both uv and ir singularities .",
    "they are computed analytically in dimensional regularization .",
    "our analytic expressions for the contractions of the resulting hadron tensors with @xmath69 agree with the literature @xcite .",
    "the virtual correction is renormalized in the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath70 ) scheme and thus uv finite .",
    "the partonic subprocesses contributing to the real correction read @xmath71 where @xmath72 with @xmath73 . as in processes  ( [ born1])([born3 ] ) , the first partons in the final states of processes  ( [ real1])([real8 ] )",
    "are taken to fragment into the hadron @xmath4 .",
    "the order in which the residual final - state partons appear is irrelevant .",
    "there are eight feynman diagrams for each of the processes  ( [ real1])([real6 ] ) and four ones for each of the processes  ( [ real7 ] ) and ( [ real8 ] ) .",
    "crossing symmetry interrelates the matrix elements of processes  ( [ real1])([real4 ] ) , those of processes  ( [ real5])([real6 ] ) , and those of processes  ( [ real7])([real8 ] ) .",
    "the cross sections of processes  ( [ real1])([real8 ] ) are of @xmath15 .",
    "those of processes  ( [ real1])([real6 ] ) are proportional to @xmath63 , while , at first sight , those of processes  ( [ real7])([real8 ] ) contain pieces proportional to @xmath63 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . however , in the case of process  ( [ real7 ] ) , the piece proportional to @xmath74 vanishes by furry s theorem , as is explained below .",
    "the squared matrix elements of processes  ( [ real1])([real4 ] ) involve one quark trace , those of processes  ( [ real5 ] ) and ( [ real6 ] ) contain pieces with one or two quark traces , and those of processes  ( [ real7 ] ) and ( [ real8 ] ) involve two quark traces . due to @xmath60 invariance , the counterparts of processes  ( [ real1])([real8 ] ) with quarks and antiquarks interchanged yield equal cross sections .",
    "notice that , in the case of process  ( [ real8 ] ) , we have to distinguish between the case where the tagged quarks @xmath65 and @xmath76 are both particles or anti - particles and the case where one is a particle and the other one is an anti - particle .",
    "processes  ( [ real1 ] ) and ( [ real6 ] ) each contain two identical untagged partons in the final state , so that their cross sections receive a statistical factor of 1/2 to avoid double counting in the phase space integration .",
    "we derived the matrix elements of processes  ( [ real1])([real8 ] ) in two steps .",
    "first , we calculated the ones of the corresponding processes of @xmath77 annihilation via a virtual photon , which may also be found in ref .",
    "then , we employed crossing symmetry .",
    "the squared matrix elements of processes  ( [ real1])([real8 ] ) , excluding the furry terms discussed below , are also implemented in the disent program package @xcite . performing a numerical comparison with the latter , we find agreement .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the squared matrix elements , which may be visualized as cut diagrams , are classified with respect to colour factors .",
    "one specific class , called _ f terms _ , contains all cut diagrams with two fermion loops , which are both coupled to three vector bosons , namely to one photon and two gluons .",
    "this class constitutes a gauge - parameter - independent subset of the nlo correction .",
    "the cut diagram of one specific member of this class is shown in fig .",
    "[ furry ] , where the on - shell quarks are indicated by numbers . as was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by furry s theorem , each cut diagram within this class exactly cancels against one counterpart in which one fermion - number flow is reversed if the on - shell quarks associated with the loop whose fermion - number flow is reversed are not tagged in the experiment , i.e.  if the three - momenta of these quarks are integrated over .",
    "this argument is also true in the case where only one fermion charge is identified , for instance in single - hadron production by @xmath77 annihilation , since there is still a counterpart diagram where the other fermion - number flow is reversed . in our case , there are two tagged partons , one coming from the proton and one fragmenting into the hadron @xmath4 .",
    "suppose the two tagged partons are the quarks 1 and 2 in the cut diagram of fig .",
    "[ furry ] .",
    "this situation can occur for processes  ( [ real5 ] ) and ( [ real6 ] ) , which involve only one quark flavour , and for process  ( [ real8 ] ) , which involves two different quark flavours .",
    "then , the furry cancellation is impeded because there is no counterpart diagram .",
    "thus , we are not allowed to omit this class of cut diagrams in our calculation .",
    "the corresponding squared matrix elements are listed in appendix  [ appfurry ] .",
    "the differential cross sections of processes  ( [ real1])([real8 ] ) have to be integrated over the three - momenta of the second and third final - state partons keeping the three - momentum of the first one fixed . performing the phase - space integrations , we encounter ir singularities of the soft and/or collinear types , which , for consistency with the virtual correction , must be extracted using dimensional regularization .",
    "it is convenient to do this by means of the dipole subtraction formalism @xcite .",
    "the general idea of this formalism is to subtract from the contribution to the real correction due to a given partonic subprocess some artificial counterterm which has the same point - wise ir - singular behaviour in @xmath78 space - time dimensions as the considered part of the real correction itself .",
    "thus , the limit @xmath79 can be performed , and the phase space integration can be evaluated numerically in four dimensions .",
    "the artificial counterterm is constructed in such a way that it can be integrated over the one - parton subspace analytically leading to poles in @xmath67 . adding the terms thus constructed to the virtual correction , the ir singularities of the latter are cancelled analytically . in the present case , where the three - momenta of two tagged partons need to be kept fixed , additional ,",
    "more complicated artificial counterterms appear than in situations where only one parton is tagged , such as inclusive jet production .",
    "a technical advantage of the dipole subtraction method compared to the phase space slicing method is that all ir singularities cancel before any numerical integration is performed .",
    "furthermore , there is no need to introduce a slicing parameter to separate soft and/or collinear phase space regions from the remaining hard region , which needs to be tuned in order to obtain a numerically stable result . for the factorization of the collinear singularities associated with the tagged partons , we choose the @xmath70 scheme . in turn",
    ", we have to employ pdfs and ffs which are defined in the same scheme .",
    "finally , we end up with two contributions , the real correction with the artificial counterterms subtracted and the virtual correction with the integrated artificial counterterms included , which are both finite in the physical limit @xmath79 and can be integrated over their three- and two - particle phase spaces , respectively , in three spacial dimensions .",
    "these integrations are performed numerically using a custom - made c@xmath80 routine . on the other hand ,",
    "all algebraic calculations are executed with help of the symbolic - manipulation package form @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to present our numerical results for the cross section of single - hadron inclusive production in @xmath12 dis .",
    "we start by specifying our input .",
    "we work in the @xmath70 renormalization and factorization scheme with @xmath81 massless quark flavours . at nlo ( lo ) , we employ set cteq6 m ( cteq6l1 ) of proton pdfs by the coordinated theoretical - experimental project on qcd ( cteq ) @xcite , the nlo ( lo ) set of ffs for light charged hadrons ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ) by kniehl , kramer , and ptter ( kkp ) @xcite , and the two - loop ( one - loop ) formula for @xmath85 with asymptotic scale parameter @xmath86  mev ( 165  mev ) @xcite .",
    "this value is compatible with the result @xmath87  mev ( @xmath88  mev ) determined in ref .",
    "we approximate the @xmath13 ffs as @xmath89 where @xmath90 refers to the sum of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 mesons , which is supported by lep1 data of hadronic @xmath93-boson decays @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume the charged hadrons to be exhausted by the charged pions , charged kaons , protons , and antiprotons , viz @xmath94 for simplicity , we identify the renormalization scale @xmath95 and the initial- and final - state factorization scales , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , and relate them to the characteristic dimensionful variables @xmath20 and @xmath11 by setting @xmath96/2 $ ] , where @xmath97 is a dimensionless parameter of order unity introduced to estimate the theoretical uncertainty due to unphysical - scale variations . as usual",

    "we expect our fixed - order predictions to break down in three extreme kinematic regimes corresponding to the limits ( i ) @xmath166 ; ( ii ) @xmath167 or , equivalently , @xmath168 or @xmath169 ; and ( iii ) @xmath170 . case ( i ) corresponds to the photoproduction limit , in which the resolved - photon contribution gains importance , especially at small values of @xmath11 and/or @xmath103 .",
    "case ( ii ) is related to the possibility that the observed hadron @xmath4 originates from the proton remnant , so that the notion of fracture functions is invoked . case ( iii ) is expected to correspond to the realm of bfkl @xcite dynamics , although it is unclear precisely where the onset of the latter is supposed to be located .",
    "our analysis is puristic in the sense that resolved virtual photons , fracture functions , and bfkl dynamics are disregarded , so as to test their actual relevance in the confrontation of the qcd - improved parton model with the experimental situation of refs .",
    "let us now scrutinize these issues . doing this , however , we have to bear in mind that the theoretical uncertainty in our nlo predictions due to the arbitrariness in the choice of the unphysical scales is particularly large in these corners of phase space , so that any conclusions are likely to be premature prior to the advent of a full nnlo analysis . from fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] , we observe that our nlo prediction for @xmath118 tends to undershoot the h1 data @xcite in the low-@xmath20 range , so that there is indeed some room for a resolved - photon contribution .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : e ] that the h1 data for @xmath115 @xcite significantly exceed our nlo prediction in the very forward region , i.e.  in the rightmost @xmath112 bin , for low values of @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath119  gev@xmath111 , the measured @xmath112 distribution exhibits a plateau in the upper @xmath112 range , whereas the nlo prediction is rapidly suppressed by the shrinkage of the available phase space for increasing value of @xmath112 .",
    "this plateau might be partly caused by @xmath13 mesons originating from the remnant jet , which contaminate the proper data sample .",
    "such events can not be described within our puristic nlo qcd framework .",
    "finally , thanks to the support from the furry terms , we find in figs .",
    "[ fig : b](a ) and ( b ) satisfactory overall agreement between our nlo prediction for @xmath117 and the h1 data @xcite down to the lowest @xmath18 values considered .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : x](b ) for @xmath116 in the low-@xmath18 bin @xmath171 .",
    "this suggest that , in the case of light - hadron inclusive production in dis at hera , the influence of the bfkl dynamics is likely to be still feeble for @xmath172 .",
    "we analytically calculated the cross section for the inclusive electroproduction of single hadrons with finite transverse momenta via virtual - photon exchange at nlo in the qcd - improved parton model , with @xmath53 massless quark flavours , on the basis of the collinear - factorization theorem .",
    "we worked in the @xmath70 renormalization and factorization scheme and handled the ir singularities using the dipole subtraction formalism @xcite .",
    "as for the virtual correction , we reproduced the result of ref .",
    "@xcite . as for the real correction , we established agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , up to the furry terms , which vanish upon phase - space integration in the case of single - jet inclusive electroproduction considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , but yield a finite contribution in the case under consideration here .    using nonperturbative ffs recently extracted from data of @xmath77 annihilation @xcite , we provided theoretical predictions for the production of @xmath13 mesons in the forward region and of charged hadrons in the current - jet region , and compared them in all possible ways with h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite data , respectively . specifically , we considered cross section distributions in @xmath11 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we found that our lo predictions always significantly fell short of the hera data and often exhibited deviating shapes .",
    "however , the situation dramatically improved as we proceeded to nlo , where our default predictions , endowed with theoretical uncertainties estimated by moderate unphysical - scale variations , led to a satisfactory description of the hera data in the preponderant part of the accessed phase space . in other words , we encountered @xmath129 factors much in excess of unity , except towards the regime of asymptotic freedom characterized by large values of @xmath11 and/or @xmath20 .",
    "this was unavoidably accompanied by considerable theoretical uncertainties .",
    "both features suggest that a reliable interpretation of the hera data @xcite within the qcd - improved parton model ultimately necessitates a full nnlo analysis , which is presently out of reach , however . for the time",
    "being , we conclude that the successful comparison of the hera data with our nlo predictions provides a useful test of the universality and the scaling violations of the ffs , which are guaranteed by the factorization theorem and are ruled by the dglap evolution equations , respectively .    significant deviations between the hera data and our nlo predictions only occurred in certain corners of phase space , namely in the photoproduction limit @xmath166 , where resolved virtual photons are expected to contribute , and in the limit @xmath168 , where fracture functions are supposed to enter the stage .",
    "both refinements were not included in our analysis .",
    "interestingly , distinctive deviations could not be observed towards the lowest @xmath18 values probed , which indicates that the realm of bfkl @xcite dynamics has not actually been accessed yet .",
