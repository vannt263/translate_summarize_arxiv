    "it is now well established that the soft x - ray spectrum of at least half of all seyfert 1 galaxies is characterised by regions of photoionised `` warm '' absorption along the line of sight ( blustin et al .",

    "extensive studies of the local seyfert population with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have revealed that the warm absorber ( wa ) is an intricate array of narrow absorption lines , often seen to be moderately blueshifted with @xmath16kms@xmath17 , from various ionisation stages of abundant elements such as c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s and fe ( e.g. kaastra et al .",
    "2000 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2002 ; crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ) .",
    "detailed modelling of the wa with photoionisation codes such as xstar ( bautista & kallman 2001 ) have shown that the absorbing material is typified by an ionisation parameter in the range @xmath18 , a column density of between @xmath19@xmath9 , and most likely originate in a wind outflowing from the putative torus ( blustin et al .",
    "2005 ) or the later stages of an accretion disk wind ( proga & kallman 2004 ) .",
    "energetically , due to their low @xmath20 , soft x - ray was typically have kinetic luminosities to the order of @xmath21 of an agn s bolometric luminosity ( e.g. blustin et al . 2005 ) and are therefore unlikely play an important role in terms of agn feedback scenarios .    in addition , there is now also a large body of observational evidence for blueshifted absorption lines at rest - frame energies greater than 7kev in many agn ( e.g. pg1211 + 143 , pounds et al .",

    "this absorption is generally attributed to fexxv / xxvi in an outflowing accretion disk wind and requires both a high column density ( i.e. @xmath22@xmath9 or above ) , high ionisation parameter ( i.e. @xmath23 ) , and an outflow velocity @xmath24c .",
    "given their large outflow velocities the resulting kinetic power of accretion disk winds can reach a significant fraction of a sources bolometric luminosity ( e.g. pounds & reeves 2007 ; tombesi et al .",
    "2010b ) and they may represent a driving mechanism for agn feedback processes .",
    "indeed , extrapolating the kinetic luminosity over a conservative active phase and outflow duty cycle for a given agn , it is often found that the total mechanical output can be in excess of , or is at least very similar to , the binding energy of a reasonably sized galaxy bulge .",
    "accretion disk winds could therefore be a possible explanation for the observed @xmath25 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) ; where mass ejected from a radiatively driven accretion disk wind ( e.g. king 2003 ) can move out into a host galaxy , sweeping up material until , once a critical black hole mass has been reached , the ism has been evacuated of material and both star formation and smbh growth cease ( see king 2010 , and references therein )      mr2251 - 178 ( @xmath26 ; bergeron et al .",
    "1983 ; canizares et al . 1978 ) was first detected as a bright x - ray source during the _ ariel v _ all - sky survey ( cooke et al .",
    "1978 ) and subsequently identified as a radio - quiet quasar by ricker et al .",
    "( 1978 ) using _",
    "sas-3 _ observations .",
    "the quasar is located on the outskirts of a cluster of approximately 50 galaxies ( phillips 1980 ) and is surrounded by a large extended nebula of diffuse gas which is characterised by [ oiii ] emission in the optical ( bergeron et al .",
    "more recent observations have also noted similar extended emission in the x - ray band ( kaspi et al .",
    "2004 ; gibson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the source is observed to be a weak radio emitter , and has a fanaroff - riley type i ( fri ) morphology .",
    "the first detailed spectral study of mr2251 - 178 in the x - rays was conducted by halpern ( 1984 ) who noticed that absorption in the soft x - ray band varied on time scales of around @xmath27 year .",
    "the variability implied an order of magnitude increase in the absorption column and was attributed to the change in ionisation of material along the line of sight .",
    "historically , this is regarded as the first suggestion of an x - ray agn warm absorber .",
    "subsequent observations with _ exosat _ , _ ginga _ and _ bepposax _ established that the broadband x - ray spectrum of mr2251 - 178 can be well described by a power - law of photon - index @xmath28 which is absorbed by a column density of around a few@xmath29@xmath9 ( pan et al .",

    "( 2001 ) to vary over a period of roughly 4 years which enabled the authors to deduce a maximum distance of @xmath322.4kpc between the absorption clouds and the continuum source .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using a series of _ asca _ , _ bepposax _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations which spanned 8.5 years , confirmed that the continuum can be described by an absorbed power - law of photon index @xmath33 but found that it further required an additional soft excess at low x - ray energies .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum required at least two or three separate ionised absorbers with column densities in the range @xmath34@xmath9 and had physical properties which appeared to vary between observations .",
    "this lead the authors to posit a scenario where absorption clouds were moving across the line of sight over the timescale of ` several months ' .",
    "further uv absorption lines from ciii , hi and ovi were detected in the _ fuse _ spectrum , which were blueshifted with velocities similar to those found by monier et al .",

    "gibson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) attributed this absorption to the ly@xmath4 line of fexxvi , and inferred that unless the absorber has a low covering fraction the mass - loss rate of mr2251 - 178 is at least an order of magnitude larger than the accretion rate .",
    "in this paper we present a new broad - band x - ray observation of mr2251 - 178 , using data obtained with both _",
    "suzaku _ and the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) .",
    "we begin by discussing the data reduction process in  [ data - reduction ] , and then parameterise the broadband spectrum in  [ preliminary - fitting ] . in  [ absorption - lines ]",
    "we discuss the several absorption lines which are detected and determine their statistical significance , before performing a detailed modelling of the spectrum with the xstar photoionisation code in  [ xstar - modelling ] . to calculate luminosities , a concordance cosmology with h@xmath36 kms@xmath17mpc@xmath17 , @xmath37=0.73 , and @xmath38=0.27 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) was adopted .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath39denotes the parameter was fixed at this value .",
    "+      we have shown that the x - ray spectrum of mr2251 - 178 can be adequately modelled with both a fully - covering and an absorption dominated partially - covered interpretation .",
    "we find that both of these models require the presence of a number of fully - covering absorbers to account for the observed fe uta , fel ( fexxiii - xxiv ) , sxv , sxvi and fexxv - xxvi absorption lines . in this section",
    ", we turn our attention to these absorbers and investigate their geometries , kinematics , and , ultimately , estimate their energetic output . for simplicity",
    "we consider here the absorbers as per the fully - covering model , and focus on the fel absorber as it is likely to be the most energetic given its high @xmath20 .",
    "for completeness , however , the methods discussed here were individually applied to all absorbers in the fully - covering model and the results are summarised in table [ absorbers ] .    note that as the parameters of the fel absorber are largely invariant between the two continuum models , the results obtained here are applicable to either interpretation and are thus not model dependent .",
    "the observed column density of a spherically symmetric absorber a distance @xmath40 from the ionising source is equal to the absorber density multiplied by the thickness of the shell of material ; i.e. @xmath41 . from the definition of the ionisation parameter , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ionising luminosity between 1 - 1000 rydbergs ( 13.6ev to 13.6kev ) and",
    "@xmath44 is the hydrogen gas density , this then implies that the inner face of the absorber , @xmath40 , is located at @xmath45 from the central ionising continuum . assuming that the absorber forms a thin shell where @xmath46 , equation ( [ explicitdist ] ) then sets an upper limit on the distance to the inner face of the absorbing material , i.e. @xmath47 . from the best - fit continuum parameters of the fully - covering model , @xmath43 is estimated to be of the order of @xmath48ergs@xmath17",
    "therefore , taking @xmath49@xmath9 and @xmath50 characteristic of the fel absorber , we find @xmath51pc .    assuming that the outflow escapes the system we can set a lower limit on the radial distance by considering the escape radius of the material . for a spherical geometry",
    "the radius at which material will be able to escape the bh is given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the gravitational radius .",
    "given that the fel absorber has an outflow velocity of @xmath54c , @xmath55 .",
    "this suggests that the outflow may have an origin consistent with an accretion disk wind or the blr .",
    "indeed , kaspi et al . (",
    "2004 ) set a lower limit on the size of the blr in mr2251 - 178 of @xmath56pc ( @xmath57rg ) , which has significant overlap with the upper limit obtained here .",
    "we can also estimate the mass outflow rate . assuming a quasi - spherical system : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the geometrical factor allowing for an outflowing wind subtending sold angle @xmath60 .",
    "the parameters of the fel absorber suggest that it is capable of expelling @xmath61yr@xmath17 . for comparison",
    ", the accretion rate required to maintain the observed radiative bolometric output is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the bolometric luminosity and @xmath64 is the accretion efficiency . with @xmath65 for a schwarzschild black - hole accreting at maximum efficiency , and adopting a uv - determined bolometric luminosity of @xmath66ergs@xmath17 ( dunn et al .",
    "2008 ) , we find that the agn in mr2251 - 178 requires an accretion rate of @xmath67yr@xmath17 to maintain its bolometric radiative output .",
    "this is orders of magnitude lower than the estimated mass outflow rate and implies that either , ( 1 ) the agn will exhaust its fuel supply of accreting material over a relatively short timescale in order to maintain an effective mass outflow rate much higher than @xmath68 , or ( 2 ) the outflow is not spherical and has a small covering fraction or is rather clumpy ( i.e. @xmath69 ) .",
    "similar conclusions were also reached by gibson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in their analysis of the _ chandra_/hetg observation .    by assuming that @xmath70 we can estimate the clumping / covering @xmath71 factor of the outflow with respect to the central nucleus , i.e. @xmath72 . the resulting inferred covering factors",
    "are listed in table [ absorbers ] .",
    "we note that in principle @xmath71 could be larger than this .",
    "however , this estimate allows us to set a conservative lower - limit to the energetics of the outflow in the next section .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of the fel absorber is : @xmath73 which implies a conservative mechanical output of @xmath74ergs@xmath17 for @xmath15 as discussed above .",
    "this makes the fel absorber the most significant outflowing component in terms of overall energetics , despite its substantial putative clumping .",
    "the energetics of the other absorbers are listed in table [ absorbers ] .",
    "assuming that the bh mass grows through accretion alone , we can then estimate a required ` active phase ' for the qso as the current estimated bh mass ( @xmath75 ) divided by the accretion rate , i.e. @xmath76yr . combining this with the mechanical output calculated",
    "previously suggests that the fel absorber has an estimated mechanical output of @xmath77erg over the lifetime of the agn .",
    "this is comparable to the binding energy of a typical @xmath78 galaxy bulge and further supports the premise that such outflows may be energetically significant in agn / galaxy feedback scenarios .",
    "we have performed a broad - band spectral analysis of the radio - quiet quasar mr2251 - 178 using recent observations from _ suzaku _ and the _ swift _ bat .",
    "below is a summary of our results :    * the continuum shows considerable curvature above around @xmath79kev and an apparent soft excess is present below 1kev .",
    "a weak ( @xmath80ev ) , unresolved ( @xmath81ev ) , fek@xmath4 emission line from neutral material is present at @xmath82kev . the spectral curvature and soft excess can be equally well modelled as an artefact of an absorption dominated , partially covered , continuum or as a fully covered intrinsic continuum component .",
    "* absorption lines due to the feuta and the fel - shell are present below 2kev .",
    "the fel line is consistent with being a blueshifted blend of 2s@xmath833p transitions from fexxiii and fexxiv .",
    "two further absorption lines are detected at @xmath84kev and @xmath85kev , which we conservatively identify with sxv he@xmath4 and sxvi ly@xmath4 . for this identification",
    "the lines require blueshifted velocities of @xmath86c and @xmath87c , respectively . from montecarlo simulations we find that all soft x - ray absorption lines are significant at the @xmath88% level .",
    "* we also detect significant ( @xmath89 from mc ) absorption in the fek band ( @xmath90kev ; rest - frame ) which is consistent with the presence of blueshifted fexxv - xxvi . a single high turbulence ( @xmath91kms@xmath17 ) ionised absorber provides a good fit to both the fel - shell line at @xmath92kev and to a portion of the absorption present in the fek band , requiring an outflow velocity of @xmath14c .",
    "* we derive distances to the absorbers and find that the fel absorption may originate at sub - parsec scales , possibly in an accretion disk wind . by balancing the mass outflow and mass accretion rates , we estimate covering fractions ( or ` clumpiness ' ) and subsequent energetics for all absorbers .",
    "the fel absorber is consistent with being substantially clumped , by a factor of around @xmath93 , but still dominates in terms of the overall energetics with an estimated kinetic output of @xmath74ergs@xmath17 .",

    "the outflow velocities ( and resultant energetics ) of the absorbers are contingent on the correct identifications of the absorption features .",
    "most of the absorption features detected in the _ suzaku _ spectrum have rest - frame energies which do not correspond to any strong features expected in the x - ray band , and have thus been conservatively identified as being the blueshifted absorption from the strongest expected nearby spectral transition . here",
    "we discuss alternative identifications for these absorption lines .",
    "the observed energy range of the suspected fexxiv ( 2s@xmath833p ) line , i.e. 1.28 - 1.30kev , is populated by an array of high - order transitions from low - abundance elements which makes a rest - frame identification unlikely .",
    "for example , the 2s@xmath83@xmath44d transitions of coxviii and coxx are found in this energy range which can be ruled out based on very low astrophysical abundances ( i.e. co / h @xmath94 ) . indeed , these transitions are also unlikely as they are expected to be very weak in comparison to their lower - order counterparts .",
    "the line at @xmath95kev is also unlikely to be identified with any blueshifted lines of the expected abundant elements ( i.e. o , ne ) without an extreme outflow velocity . indeed ,",
    "if identified with h- or he - like neon ( 1.02kev and 0.922kev , respectively ) the outflow velocity would be @xmath96c .",
    "this is much larger than that typically found in agn warm absorbers ( e.g. blustin et al .",
    "furthermore , an identification with the 1s@xmath832p lines of nax / xi ( 1.12kev and 1.24kev ) is unlikely as such na absorption has not been reported in even the longest exposure agn x - ray spectra ( e.g. kaspi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "as an identification with any local 1s@xmath832p transition is unlikely , we also considered nearby 2s@xmath833p transitions .",
    "the most likely 2s@xmath833p transition local to the observed @xmath321.29kev line is that of fexxiv at @xmath97kev . for",
    "this identification the line would then require an outflow velocity of @xmath24c .",
    "we note that while the oscillator strengths of the 2s@xmath833p lines of fe xxv ( expected at @xmath98kev ) are expected to be higher than those of fe xxiv in this band , the required outflow velocity assuming this identification ( @xmath99c ) would be incompatible with that obtained from xstar fitting ( see  [ fel_abs ] ) .",
    "the lines at @xmath100kev and @xmath101kev do not correspond with any expected transitions in the rest - frame .",
    "the only transitions which have consistent rest - frame energies are those associated with extremely low abundance elements which are not expected to be observed in the x - ray spectrum ( e.g. kr , rb , mo ) .",
    "the higher energy line is consistent with the 1s@xmath833p he - like sulphur line at @xmath102kev but such an identification is again unlikely given that at the best - fitting ionisation stage ( table [ final_fcov ] ) h - like sulphur is expected to be the dominant ion ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) .",
    "furthermore , if the line was caused by the he - like sulphur 1s@xmath833p line , we would still expect to see much stronger 1s@xmath832p transitions , which are not present .",
    "thus a @xmath103 origin appears to be ruled out for both of the lines and they are most likely be blueshifted .",
    "the most likely ions in the 2 - 3kev energy band which are expected to be strong in the x - rays are he- and h - like sulphur at @xmath104kev and @xmath105kev , respectively .",
    "an identification with silicon ( e.g. sixiv ly@xmath4 at 2.01kev ) would require a substantially larger soft x - ray outflow velocity @xmath106c and thus seems unlikely ; as does an identification with any lower z ions for similar reasons .",
    "while their oscillator strengths suggest that the absorption features between 7 - 8kev are most likely fexxv / xxvi , several other elements are also expected to have transitions above @xmath107kev which may interfere with this identification .",
    "most notable of these are h- and he - like nickel which have 1s@xmath832p lines at rest - frame energies of @xmath108kev and @xmath109kev , respectively .",
    "the observed energy of the absorption feature is consistent with neither of these transitions without significant redshift , however , making an identification unlikely .",
    "an identification with lower ionisation nickel could be plausible but the column densities at which moderately ionised nickel would be observed are unacceptably high ( i.e. @xmath110@xmath9 ) and with an abundance ratio of fe / ni@xmath111 ( grevesse & suvaul 1998 ) we would also expect to observe hugely dominant 1s@xmath832p fe transitions , which are not observed .",
    "thus an identification with ni would appear to be ruled out .",
    "for the tentative high - ionisation fek absorber an identification with any ions other than fexxvi is unlikely given the high ionisation as fexxvi is expected to be the only abundant ions at the best fit ionisation parameter ( kallman et al .",
    "2004 ) . furthermore",
    ", while zone 5 may be contributing fexxiii - xxiv 1s@xmath832p lines to the fek band , fexxv is expected to be the dominant ion at the measured ionisation parameter and we adopt it as our most probable line identification for the contribution of zone 5 to the fek band ."
