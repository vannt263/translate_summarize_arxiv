    "this paper is aimed to be a survey article on the polynomial representation of knots and includes all the results proved by the authors .",
    "a. durfee and d. oshea @xcite wrote a similar paper in 2006 .",
    "our paper provides a more constructive approach and uses recent knot theoretic results .",
    "polynomial representation for long knots were first shown by shastri @xcite .",
    "shastri proved that for every knot - type @xmath0 there exist real polynomials @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that the map @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 represents @xmath6 and in fact the above map defines an embedding of @xmath7 in @xmath8 shastri s motivation for proving this theorem was perhaps to find a non - rectifiable polynomial embedding of complex affine line in complex affine space which could prove one of the famous conjecture of abhayankar @xcite .",
    "however , this conjecture is still open . a knot represented by a polynomial embedding",
    "is refered as a polynomial knot .",
    "similar to the case of harmonic knots @xcite and holonomic knots @xcite it has been proved that the space of all knots @xcite , up to ambient isotopy , can be replaced by the space of all polynomial knots , up to polynomial isotopy @xcite .",
    "however polynomial parametrization of knots not only represents the knot type , it also can represent a specific knot diagram .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that we can capture the symmetric behavior of knots such as strong invertibility and strong negative amphicheirality in their polynomial representation @xcite .",
    "polynomial knots are also important from the point of view of computability as we can easily obtain three dimensional graphs of polynomial knots using _ mathematica _ or _ maple _ as illustrated in section 6 .    in shastri",
    "s theorem the existence of a polynomial representation for a given knot type @xmath6 is shown by using weierstrass approximation .",
    "thus , estimating the degrees of the polynomials is not clear .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is a polynomial representation of a knot type @xmath6 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then we say that @xmath11 is a _ degree sequence _ of @xmath6 .",
    "we define @xmath11 to be the _ minimal degree sequence _ of @xmath6 if @xmath11 is minimal amongst all the degree sequences of @xmath6 with respect to the usual lexicographic ordering of @xmath12 .",
    "note that a degree sequence of @xmath6 need not be unique .",
    "also , with a given triple @xmath13 of positive integers , the space of polynomial knots with @xmath13 as a degree sequence is a _ semi algebraic set _ @xcite , and thus only finitely many knot - types can be realized with a given degree sequence .",
    "hence , for a given knot - type estimating a degree sequence and eventually the minimal degree sequence is an important aspect for polynomial knots . in our earlier papers ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite )",
    "we have estimated a degree sequence and the minimal degree sequence for torus knots and 2-bridge knots .    in this paper , for any given knot type",
    "we give a concrete algorithm for writing down a polynomial representation and hence estimating a degree sequence .",
    "for this purpose , we use a recent theory of _ quasi toric _",
    "braid representation of knots @xcite .",
    "it is established by manturov that every knot is ambient isotopic to some knot which is obtained by making a few crossing changes in some torus knot @xcite .",
    "thus , when we know a degree sequence for all torus knots , we can have some estimate on a degree sequence for a general knot also . here",
    "we discuss this idea in detail and provide a method to obtain a degree sequence for a general knot type .    in section 2 , we provide the basic definitions and historical background of the subject . we also include some known results without the proofs . in section 3 , we state and",
    "prove the main result .",
    "we demonstrate this method and construct a polynomial representation for the knot @xmath14 in section 4 .",
    "polynomial representation of all knots up to 8 crossings and their 3d plots taken with the help of _ mathematica _ are included in section 5 and section 6 respectively .",
    "in this section we present the basic definitions , background and the known results which serves as the prerequisite for the main result .",
    "two non - compact knots @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 are said to be equivalent if their extensions @xmath17 and @xmath18 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 are ambient isotopic .",
    "an equivalence class of a non - compact knot is a knot - type .",
    "once we have an embedding of @xmath4 in @xmath5 we may wish to see if it can be extended as an embedding of @xmath7 in @xmath21 .",
    "when we have an embedding given by @xmath22 from @xmath4 to @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath2 are three real polynomials , it defines a non - compact knot and it can always be made into a polynomial embedding of @xmath7 in @xmath21 by perturbing the coefficients of any one of the polynomials .",
    "two polynomial embeddings @xmath26 are said to be _ algebraically equivalent _ if there exists a polynomial automorphism @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 .",
    "a polynomial embedding @xmath29 is said to be _",
    "rectifiable _ if it is algebraically equivalent to the standard embedding @xmath30 of @xmath7 in @xmath8    ( abhayankar@xcite ) there exist _ non - rectifiable _ embeddings of @xmath7 in @xmath8    the above stated conjecture is still open .    if a polynomial embedding @xmath31 which is also an embedding of @xmath29 is rectifiable , using a polynomial automorphism with real coefficients only , it is certainly a trivial knot .    thus to obtain examples of non - rectifiable embeddings",
    "we must have polynomial embeddings which represent non - trivial knots .",
    "this raises the following question : _ does every knot have a polynomial representation ? _    fortunately we have an affirmative answer and the following results have been proved in this line .",
    "@xcite every knot - type ( @xmath32 ) has a polynomial representation @xmath3 which is also an embedding of @xmath33    @xcite two polynomial embeddings @xmath34 representing the same knot - type are polynomially isotopic . by polynomially isotopic",
    "we mean that there exists @xmath35 \\},$ ] a one parameter family of polynomial embeddings , such that @xmath36 and @xmath37    both these theorems were proved using _",
    "approximation_. thus the nature and the degrees of the defining polynomials can not be estimated .",
    "a triple @xmath38 is said to be a _ degree sequence _ of a given knot - type @xmath6 if there exists @xmath39 and @xmath40 real polynomials , of degrees @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , such that the map @xmath22 is an embedding which represents the knot - type @xmath6 .",

    "it is easy to observe that these degree sequences are not the minimal degree sequence for torus knots . for minimal degree sequence",
    "we have the following :    @xcite the minimal degree sequence for torus knot of type @xmath50 for @xmath51 is @xmath52 ;  @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "@xcite the minimal degree sequence for a 2-bridge knot having minimal crossing number @xmath55 is given by    1 .",

    "rational tangle_. for a general knot - type there may not be such systematic nice diagram available .",
    "for any two positive integers @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the @xmath71-braid @xmath73 is called the _ toric braid _ of type @xmath74 .",
    "closure of a toric braid gives a torus link of type @xmath75 .",
    "in particular if @xmath76 , then we obtain the torus knot of type @xmath69 , and it is denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "a braid @xmath78 is said to be _ quasitoric _ of type @xmath75 if it can be expressed as @xmath79 , where each @xmath80 , with @xmath81 is either @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",

    "( manturov s theorem @xcite ) each knot isotopy class can be obtained as a closure of some quasitoric braid .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath6 be a knot which is closure of a quasitoric braid obtained from a toric braid @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , by making @xmath86 crossing changes .",
    "then @xmath87 is a degree sequence for @xmath6 , where @xmath88 is the least positive integer such that @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    in order to prove this theorem",

    "* let @xmath93 be such that all crossings correspond to parameter values @xmath94 and in any of the open intervals @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 all the crossings are of the same type ( either over or under ) , also in successive intervals , the crossings are of opposite type",
    ". now define @xmath98 it is easy to observe that @xmath2 has constant sign on each interval and opposite sign on consecutive intervals , i.e. it provides an over / under crossing data for the knot - type . hence @xmath3 is a polynomial representation of @xmath6 .",

    ".    * proof . * it can be easily shown by induction .",
    "* proof of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "* since the regular projection of @xmath6 , is same as that of @xmath104 , it has @xmath105 real ordinary double points .    when @xmath106 in this case by taking a real deformation of the curve @xmath107 with maximum number of real nodes , which is @xmath105 , we obtain a regular projection of this knot .",
