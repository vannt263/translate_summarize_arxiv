    "it seems plausible that the true origin of high - temperature superconductivity is found in a proper combination of the finite - range coulomb repulsion with a significant finite - range epi as suggested by a growing number of experimental and theoretical studies @xcite . in highly polarizable ionic lattices like cuprate superconductors both interactions are quite strong ( of the order of 1 ev ) compared with the low fermi energy of doped carriers because of a poor screening by non- or near - adiabatic carriers @xcite . in those conditions",
    "the bcs - eliashberg theory @xcite breaks down because of the polaronic collapse of the electron bandwidth @xcite .",
    "the many - body theory for polarons has been developed for extremely weak and strong epi . in the weak - coupling limit this problem",
    "is reduced to the study of a structure factor of the uniform large polaron gas @xcite . for strong coupling",
    "the problem is reduced to on - site @xcite or inter - site @xcite small bipolarons on a lattice .",
    "a strong enhancement of t@xmath3 was predicted in the crossover region from the bcs - like polaronic to bec - like bipolaronic superconductivity due to a sharp increase of the density of states in a narrow polaronic band @xcite , which is missing in the so - called _ negative _ hubbard @xmath4 model .",
    "nevertheless the theory of dense polaronic systems in the intermediate coupling regime remains highly cumbersome , in particular , when epi competes with strong electron correlations .",
    "corresponding microscopic models with the on - site hubbard repulsion and the short - range holstein epi have been studied using powerful numerical techniques @xcite .    in most analytical and numerical studies",
    "mentioned above and many others both interactions are introduced as input parameters not directly related to the material .",
    "quantitative calculations of the interaction matrix elements can be performed from pseudopotentials using the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can express the bare coulomb repulsion and epi through material parameters rather than computing them from first principles in many physically important cases @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a polar coupling to longitudinal optical phonons ( the frhlich epi ) , which is the major epi in polar crystals , both the momentum dependence of the matrix element , @xmath5 , and its magnitude are well known , @xmath6 with a dimensionless @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a unit cell volume , @xmath9 is the number of unit cells in a crystal , @xmath10 is the optical phonon frequency , and @xmath11 . the high - frequency , @xmath12 and the static , @xmath13 dielectric constants are both measurable in a parent polar insulator .",
    "as is well known , a two - particle bound state exists even in the weak - coupling regime , @xmath14 , due to a quantum ( exchange ) interaction between two large polarons forming a _  large bipolaron _",
    "@xcite(@xmath15 is the familiar epi constant of the bcs - eliashberg theory ) .",
    "these weakly coupled large pairs overlap in dense systems , so that their many - particle ground state is a bcs - like superconductor with cooper pairs ( see below ) .    here",
    "the analytical multi - polaron theory is given in the strong - coupling regime for highly polarizable lattices with @xmath16 .",
    "the dielectric response function of strongly correlated electrons is _ apriori _ unknown .",
    "hence one has to start with a generic hamiltonian including _ unscreened _ coulomb and frhlich interactions operating on the same scale since any ad - hoc assumption on their range and relative magnitude might fail , @xmath17+h_{ph}. \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath18 is the bare hopping integral , @xmath19 is the chemical potential , @xmath20 and @xmath21 include both site @xmath22 and spin @xmath23 states , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are electron and phonon operators , respectively , @xmath26 is a site occupation operator , and @xmath27 is the polar vibration energy .    in highly polarizable lattices with @xmath28 the familiar lang - firsov ( lf ) @xcite canonical transformation @xmath29 is particulary instrumental with @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "it shifts the ions to new equilibrium positions changing the phonon vacuum , and removes most of _ both _ interactions from the transformed hamiltonian , @xmath31 , @xmath32where @xmath33 is the renormalised hopping integral involving the multi - phonon transitions described with @xmath34 $ ] , and @xmath35 is the chemical potential shifted by the polaron level shift , @xmath36here , the integration goes over the brillouin zone ( bz ) and @xmath37 ev in la@xmath38cuo@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constant is defined as @xmath40 . in the case of 2d carriers with a constant bare density of states ,",
    "@xmath41 per spin , eq.([shift ] ) places cuprates in the strong - coupling regime , @xmath42 , if the bare band mass @xmath43 ( here @xmath44 is the in - plane lattice constant ) .",
    "for comparison , let us first consider the weak - coupling limit , where not only @xmath45 but also the number of phonons dressing the carrier is small , @xmath46 . in this limit one can expand @xmath47 in eq.([trans ] ) in powers of @xmath48 keeping just single - phonon transitions so that ( in the momentum representation ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the bare band dispersion , and @xmath52/\\sqrt{2n}$ ] is the transformed epi matrix element , renormalised by the coulomb repulsion .",
    "there are no other interactions left in the transformed hamiltonian since the bare coulomb repulsion is nullified by the frhlich epi .    applying the bcs - eliashberg formalism @xcite yields the master equation for the superconducting order parameter , @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 $ ] is the phonon propagator and @xmath56 are the matsubara frequencies ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "depending on a particular shape of the band dispersion , eq.([master ] ) allows for different symmetries of the order parameter since epi is not local @xcite .",
    "here we confine our analysis to a simple estimate of t@xmath3 by assuming a @xmath58-independent gap function , @xmath59 . then factorizing the kernel in eq.([master ] ) on the `` mass shell '' , @xmath60 and linearizing eq.([master ] ) with respect to the gap function one obtains the familiar estimate of the critical temperature , @xmath61 $ ] , where @xmath62 is the coulomb pseudopotential . in our case the weak - coupling bcs superconductivity with @xmath63 exists _ exclusively _ due to the `` tolmachev - morel - anderson '' logarithm @xmath64 , if the epi is retarded ( i.e. @xmath65 ) .",
    "actually the number of virtual phonons in the polaron cloud is large in oxides and some other polar lattices , @xmath66 with the characteristic ( oxygen ) optical phonon frequency @xmath67 mev , so that multi - phonon vertexes are essential in the expansion of the hopping operator @xmath68 . to deal with this challenging problem",
    "let us single out the coherent hopping in eq.([trans ] ) averaging @xmath69 with respect to the phonon vacuum , and consider the remaining terms as perturbation , @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 describes free phonons and polarons coherently propagating in a narrow band with the exponentially diminished hopping integral , @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 ,   \\label{t}\\ ] ] and @xmath74 is the residual polaron - multiphonon interaction , which is a perturbation at large @xmath75 . in the diagrammatic technique",
    "the corresponding vertexes have any number of phonon lines as shown in fig.sigma for the second - order in @xmath76 polaron self - energy ( @xmath77 ) and the phonon self - energy ( @xmath78 ) @xcite , where @xmath79 is the lattice coordination number and @xmath80 is the atomic density of carriers .",
    "hence the perturbation expansion in @xmath81 is applied if @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "importantly there is no structural instability in the strong coupling regime since @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the lf transformation , eq.([trans ] ) is exact for any adiabatic ratio @xmath84 .",
    "however , if the perturbation expansion in @xmath85 is restricted by lowest orders , then it significantly overestimates polaron masses in the adiabatic regime , @xmath86 , for the case of the short - range ( holstein ) epi @xcite ( here @xmath87 is the nearest - neighbor bare hopping integral ) .",
    "the polaronic band narrowing factor , @xmath88 becomes very small for this epi in the strong - coupling regime , which would eliminate any possibility of high temperature superconductivity and even metallicity of the small hosltein polarons .    in our case of the long - range ( frhlich ) epi ,",
    "quantum monte - carlo simulations @xcite show that the lf transformation provides numerically accurate polaron masses already in the zero order of the inverse - coupling expansion both in the adiabatic regime as well as in the non - adiabatic one for _ any _ strength of the frhlich epi",
    ". moreover , such small polarons @xcite and small bipolarons @xcite are perfectly mobile in the relevant range of the coupling and the adiabatic ratio @xcite .",
    "the perturbation @xmath76 has no diagonal matrix elements with respect to phonon occupation numbers .",
    "hence it can be removed from the hamiltonian in the first order using a second canonical transformation @xmath89 with @xmath90 here @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "taking into account that the polaron fermi energy is small compared with the phonon energy at strong coupling and/or sufficiently low doping @xcite , one can neglect its contribution to @xmath93 and project the second - order in @xmath85 hamiltonian @xmath94 onto the phonon vacuum @xmath95 with the following result @xmath96 where @xmath97\\hat{x}^{\\dagger}_{i^\\prime } \\hat{x}% _ { j^\\prime}|0\\rangle , \\label{int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath98 is the heisenberg multi - phonon operator obtained by replacing @xmath99 in @xmath100 with @xmath101 . calculating the integral , eq.([int ] ) with @xmath102 yields @xmath103 where @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "all matrix elements , eq.([v2 ] ) , of the polaron - polaron interaction are small compared with the polaron kinetic energy except the _ exchange _ interaction , @xmath106 such that @xmath107 . using @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( for large @xmath111 ) one obtains a substantial @xmath112 , which is much larger than the polaron hopping integral , @xmath113 in the strong coupling limit . here",
    "@xmath1 is the nearest - neighbor polaron hopping integrals . keeping only this exchange we finally arrive with the polaronic `` t - j@xmath0 '' hamiltonian , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the spin 1/2 operator ( @xmath116 are the pauli matrices ) , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the chemical potential further renormalized by @xmath76 .",
    "there is a striking difference between this polaronic t - j@xmath0 hamiltonian and the familiar t - j model derived from the repulsive hubbard u hamiltonian in the limit @xmath119 omitting the so - called three - site hoppings and epi @xcite .",
    "the latter model acts in a projected hilbert space constrained to no double occupancy . within this standard t - j model the bare transfer amplitude of electrons ( @xmath1 )",
    "sets the energy scale for incoherent transport , while the heisenberg interaction ( @xmath120 ) allows for spin flips leading to coherent hole motion with an effective bandwidth determined by @xmath121 . using the gutzwiller - type approximation to remove the constraint results in an unconstrained t - j model also containing a band narrowing , but purely electronic rather than phononic origin @xcite . on the contrary in our polaronic t - j@xmath0 hamiltonian , eq.([tj ] ) there is no constraint on the double on - site occupancy since the coulomb repulsion is negated by the frhlich epi .",
    "the polaronic hopping integral @xmath1 leads to the coherent ( bi)polaron band and the antiferromagnetic exchange of purely phononic origin @xmath122 bounds polarons into small superlight inter - site bipolarons .",
    "last but not least the difference is in the `` + '' sign in the last term of eq.([tj ] ) proportional to @xmath123 , which protects the ground superconducting state from the bipolaron clustering , in contrast with the `` - '' sign in the similar term of the standard t - j model , where the phase separation is expected at sufficiently large j @xcite .",
    "-0.5 mm    the cancelation of the bare coulomb repulsion by the frhlich epi is accurate up to a @xmath124 correction .",
    "this correction produces a long - range residual repulsion of ( bi)polarons in the transformed hamiltonian , eq.([tj ] ) , which is small as soon as @xmath125 . the residual repulsion results in some screening of the coulomb interactions responsible for the doping dependence of the bipolaron binding energy and of the ( bi)polaron mass @xcite .",
    "in layered polar insulators the static dielectric constant could be anisotropic , which together with local field corrections might result in different epi matrix elements for in - plane and out - of - plane polarised optical phonons , respectively .",
    "the difference is not considered here .",
    "the polaronic t - j@xmath0 hamiltonian , eq.([tj ] ) is analytically solvable in the limit of sufficiently low atomic density of carriers , @xmath126 . neglecting the first term in @xmath94 , which is the polaron kinetic energy proportional to @xmath127",
    ", one can readily diagonalise the remaining spin - exchange part of the hamiltonian .",
    "its ground state is an ensemble of inter - site singlet bipolarons with the binding energy @xmath128 localised on nearest neighbor sites .",
    "such small bipolarons repel each other and single polarons via a short - range repulsion of about @xmath129 .",
    "the kinetic energy operator in eq.([tj ] ) connects singlet configurations in the first and higher orders with respect to the polaronic hopping integrals . taking into account only the lowest - energy degenerate singlet configurations and discarding all other configurations one can project the t - j@xmath0 hamiltonian onto the inter - site bipolaronic hamiltonian using the bipolaron annihilation operators @xmath130 , where @xmath131 connects nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "these operators are similar to the bond - order operators introduced later by newns and tsuei @xcite , which are weakly coupled in their model with the single - plane lattice vibrations via a nonlinear ( two - phonon ) epi [ eq.(9 ) in ref .",
    "actually it is well known that the nonlinear anharmonic corrections to epi are small compared with the linear frhlich interaction in real three - dimensional solids , which makes the two - dimensional model of ref.@xcite of cuprate superconductors unfeasible .",
    "our strong - coupling projection is illustrated using a polar lattice , sketched in fig.[toy]a , of anion - cation triangular planes ( the in - plane lattice constant is @xmath44 and the nearest - neighbor hopping distance is @xmath132 ) separated by the out - of - plane lattice constant @xmath133 . for a zig - zag ladder - fragment of the lattice , fig.toyb , the projected bipolaronic hamiltonian in the nearest - neighbor hopping approximation is @xmath134 where @xmath135 are annihilation operators of the four degenerate singlets .",
    "fourier transformation @xmath136 yields four bipolaronic bands , @xmath137 $ ] , @xmath138 $ ] with the center - of - mass momentum @xmath139 . expanding in powers of @xmath140 one obtains the effective mass of these small singlets , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the polaron mass .",
    "a similar hamiltonian can be derived also for a square lattice , if next - nearest - neighbor hopping integrals are taking into account @xcite .",
    "small bipolarons are hard - core bosons with the short - range repulsion of the radius @xmath143 and a huge anisotropy of their effective mass since their inter - plane hopping is possible only in the second order of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of superconductivity in bipolaronic strong coupling systems is not controlled by the pairing strength , but by the phase coherence among the electron pairs @xcite .",
    "while in two dimensions bose condensation does not occur in either the ideal or the interacting system , there is a phase transition to a superfluid state at @xmath144}}\\ ] ] in the dilute bose gas @xcite ( here @xmath145 is the boson density per unit area ) . using eqs.([shift ] , [ t ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath146 and @xmath147 , allowing for a quantitative estimate of t@xmath3 ( here @xmath148 ) . with typical values of @xmath149 nm , @xmath150 nm , @xmath151 , the bare band mass @xmath152 , @xmath153 mev and the moderate atomic density of polarons , @xmath154 ( avoiding an overlap of bipolarons ) one obtains @xmath155 ev , @xmath156 , and @xmath157k .",
    "importantly , the projection procedure of reducing eq.([tj ] ) to eq.([bip ] ) is well justified since the ratio @xmath158 is small and @xmath159 , so that only the lowest singlet configurations can be included while discarding the others .    in conclusion , it seems very likely that a peculiar cancelation of the long - range coulomb repulsion by the long - range frhlich epi can help much in producing high - temperature superconductivity in doped polar insulators such as cuprates and other oxides , for instance bakbio .",
    "the polaronic t - j@xmath0 hamiltonian , eq.([tj ] ) derived here from the bare long - range coulomb interactions could provide a novel avenue for analytical and computational studies of superconductivity in complex ionic lattices since the repulsive hubbard u model and its strong - coupling t - j projection do not explain high t@xmath3 @xcite .",
