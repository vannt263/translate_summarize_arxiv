    "silicon nanowires ( nw ) represent building blocks for nanoscale electronics.@xcite they can be fabricated with a very good control of composition , size and shape.@xcite for si nw with a diameter of 5 nm and less , the number of atoms in the nw cross section becomes countable .",
    "therefore , one should take into account electron - phonon interaction , crystalline orientation and quantum confinement to estimate transport characteristics of si nw in order to predict the performance of nanoscale transistors , sensors and thermoelectric devices .",
    "in contrast to the bulk materials conventionally used in thermoelectrics , the nanostructured materials offer a possibility to design thermoelectric devices with an improved efficiency by exploiting the quantum confinement of electrons and phonons on the nanoscale.@xcite in this case , a fully atomistic simulation considering both the electron and phonon band structures as well as electron - phonon interaction is required to estimate thermoelectric properties .",
    "the calculation of the transport properties of nanowires poses special challenges .",
    "both the electronic and the vibrational spectrum are strongly altered compared to bulk by confinement effects . the effective mass approximation and the k.p theory were widely used for transport calculations.@xcite these approaches become questionable for nanowires , at least if their diameter is just a few lattice constants .",
    "atomistic methods , such as the tight - binding ( tb ) electronic structure approach or density functional theory calculations , should be used instead.@xcite in refs .   and  , the electron - phonon coupling was described by using the deformation potential approach .",
    "however , care must be taken when carrying over bulk - derived deformation potentials to nanowires .",
    "the classification of the phonons into acoustic and optical modes is helpful for bulk modes , but a more subtle classification ( including flexural and torsional modes ) is required for the vibrational modes of a nanowire.@xcite for these classes , deformation potentials are not available .",
    "moreover , empirical data for deformation potentials are applicable only for the lowest ( bulk ) conduction band , and for a limited temperature range , usually around room temperature .",
    "theoretical work properly addressing the atomistic details of electron - phonon coupling in nanowires are still scarce . for example ,",
    "et al._@xcite calculated the electron mobility for different diameters and growth directions of si nws taking into account the electron - phonon scattering derived in the framework of the first nearest - neighbor @xmath8 tb model .",
    "the si dimers on the @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath2 $ ] si nw surfaces were not considered .",
    "the calculations were done considering only the lowest conduction subbands at a room temperature . at high temperatures ,",
    "this treatment is not adequate because the high energy electron subbands play essential role in the transport properties . using the similar treatment of the the electron - phonon scattering , zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite calculated the electron mobility for @xmath9$]-oriented si nws with different diameters .",
    "their calculations were done at two temperatures , 77  k and 300  k. these data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the temperature dependence of the electron mobility .    here , our aim is to investigate the use of si nws for thermoelectrics over a wide temperature range .",
    "this requires to study the temperature dependence of electron - phonon scattering in the nws .",
    "in addition to the temperature dependence of the scattering rate , it is also important to account for its dependence on electron energy .",
    "this is because , in thermoelectrics , electrons with energies considerably above the band bottom may have a significant impact on the seebeck coefficient and the thermal conductivity .",
    "this is on contrast to the ohmic regime of charge transport , where electrons just above the band edge dominate the transport properties .",
    "the focus of this work is to calculate accurately transport properties of si nws based on an atomistic model , which is close to a real system . for this purpose ,",
    "we take into account relaxation in the atomistic structure , presence of si dimers on the @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath2 $ ] si nw surfaces , all confined phonon modes , and all electron subbands in an energy range from the conduction band bottom to 5@xmath10 above . to calculate the matrix elements of the electron - phonon coupling hamiltonian",
    ", we have used the tight - binding approach for the electronic structure , employing the phononic structure obtained from an atomistic force field method as input .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the electronic and phonon band structures as well as the underlying physics . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe thermoelectric transport coefficients in the framework of the linearized boltzmann transport theory . also , we describe the electron - phonon transition rate in terms of the tb formalism .",
    "we discuss the energy and temperature dependence of the transport distribution function and total scattering rate as well as the relaxation time as a solution of the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "the temperature dependencies of the thermoelectric parameters and electron mobility of _ n_-type si nws are presented in sec .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "v. in appendices a  c , a detailed description of the matrix elements of the electron - phonon coupling hamiltonian in terms of the @xmath11 2nd nearest - neighbor tb formalism is presented .",
    "we also describe the iterative orthomin(1 ) method used for solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the si nw structure with square - shaped cross - section along the @xmath0 $ ] crystalline orientation .",
    "the nw length is assumed to be infinite in the transport direction @xmath12 .",
    "the nw thickness is 1.6 nm .",
    "the si - si dimers are shown on the lateral nw surface . to properly take into account these dimers , we considered the supercell with a length of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a lattice parameter of the bulk silicon .",
    "the width of the nw is @xmath15 .",
    "the surface si atoms with one dangling bond are hydrogenated . in the non - relaxed structure ,",
    "the si - si and si - h bond lengths are 2.35    and 1.48   , respectively.@xcite using the general utility lattice program ( gulp ) based on force field methods , a relaxation of atom positions about the given atom coordinates was achieved by means of a minimization of the total energy of the atomic system.@xcite both rational functional optimization and conjugate gradients methods were used to calculate relaxation in the atomistic structure",
    ".    we have considered @xmath16-type si nanowires doped by phosphorus atoms .",
    "the donor charge transfer level is equal to @xmath17  ev relative to the conduction band edge.@xcite here , we do not take into consideration the electron - impurity scattering .",
    "the impurity concentrations quoted in the results are merely used to define the temperature dependence of the fermi level .",
    "( color online ) schematic diagram representing the si nw structure passivated by hydrogen atoms .",
    "the si ( h ) atoms are represented by large ( small ) spheres.,width=264 ]      the electronic band structure for si nws was computed using a semi - empirical tb approach , where the two - center orthogonal @xmath3 model was used taking into account the 1st and 2nd nearest neighbors.@xcite the tight - binding parameters were chosen in such a way to accurately represent the band gap of bulk silicon .",
    "the model allows for a dependence of the tight - binding matrix elements on both the bond angles and on the bond distances , using power laws , with exponents chosen to reproduce the known deformation potentials of bulk silicon .",
    "the matrix elements of the tb hamiltonian are presented in appendix a. in order to enable an accurate description of the effects of crystal deformations on the electronic structure , we include effects of screening \" of the interaction with the 2nd - nearest neighbor atom due to displacements of the nearest neighbor atom . to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , we have used the standard library lapack.@xcite    in the si bulk material , the conduction band structure consists of six valleys placed along the lines of @xmath18 symmetry close to the @xmath19 point in the brillouin zone .",
    "it is an indirect band gap semiconductor , because the edges of the valence bands are located at the @xmath20 point .",
    "its band gap is equal to 1.12 ev  ( ref .  ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] represents the electron band structure computed for the [ 100]-oriented si nw with a thickness of 1.6 nm .",
    "the origin of the energy axis corresponds to the top of the valence band at the @xmath20 point in the brillouin zone of the bulk si material .",
    "the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction is rather weak in the si material , hence , the energy subband splitting due to the so effect is invisible in the plot , and each plotted line corresponds to a doubly degenerate state . for the given nw growth orientation , the six electron ellipsoidal valleys equivalent in bulk si are split into two groups , including four and two ellipsoids in the si nw , respectively . the confinement effect and the symmetry lowering due to surface dimerization lead to a further splitting of the conduction subbands . at the @xmath20 point ,",
    "the bottoms of the conduction subbands are 1.546 ( doubly degenerate ) , 1.548 and 1.584 ev , respectively .",
    "these subbands originate from the backfolding of the four ellipsoids located in the @xmath21-plane onto the @xmath22 point because of the confinement in the spatial directions perpendicular to the nw axis .",
    "they show a rather large dispersion at @xmath22 as functions of @xmath23 , which corresponds to a direction of low effective mass of these ellipsoids .",
    "two of these subbands reach the edge of the brillouin zone at @xmath24 at an energy of 1.72  ev .",
    "one of them even has a shallow minimum at 0.271  @xmath25 .",
    "these two subbands change their orbital character as function of @xmath23 , and near the brilloiun zone boundary they obtain the character of the states in the two ellipsoids along the ( 100)-direction in bulk si . as these ellipsoids have their heavy - mass direction along ( 100 )",
    ", the subbands show a weak disperison and are rather flat at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "the si nw is a direct bandgap semiconductor .",
    "its band gap is found to be equal to 2.18 ev at the @xmath20 point .",
    "because of the different effective masses , one can expect that the transport properties of @xmath16-type si nws are mainly defined by the electrons in the band minima centered at the @xmath20 point rather than by the electronic states near the brillouin zone boundary .     the electron band structure computed for the [ 100]-oriented si nw with a thickness of 1.6 nm .",
    "the graph includes 40 subbands , including degenerate ones .",
    "the zero of energy is set to the valence band top of bulk si.,width=264 ]    a comparison of our results with data obtained by markussen _",
    "indicates that the presence of dimers on the nw surface leads to a significant modification of the electronic structure .",
    "for example , the electron density of states ( dos ) increases at the @xmath20 point.@xcite in the transport calculations , we considered 12 electron subbands fitted in the energy range of 5@xmath10 . at the @xmath20 point , spanning the energy interval from 1.5 to 1.8 ev .      based on an atomistic model , the phonon band structure was calculated in the framework of brenner s valence force field model .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix were computed by using gulp.@xcite figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the phonon band structure for the [ 100]-oriented si nw with a thickness of 1.6 nm . in this system of 226 atoms ,",
    "there are 678 different phonon modes .",
    "the phonon modes with the highest excitation energy correspond to the very light hydrogen atoms .",
    "their energies belong to the interval from 270 to 285 mev .",
    "these modes have no effect on the transport properties .",
    "the phonon density of states is a non - monotonic function of energy .",
    "it has a clear minimum in the energy range between 22 and 29  mev .",
    "the lower boundary of this interval reflects the highest possible energy of the transverse acoustic mode in bulk si .",
    "the phonon dos is sharply - peaked around energy values of 14 , 39 , and 58 mev .",
    "this results from mixed states of acoustic and optical phonons , as well as the optical phonon modes .",
    "the non - monotonic dependence of the phonon dos effects the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients described in the following sections .",
    "the phonon band structure computed for the [ 100]-oriented si nw with a thickness of 1.6 nm .",
    "the graph includes 410 phonon modes .",
    "the energy of the si ",
    "h stretch modes is outside the scale of the graph.,width=264 ]    in contrast to the bulk phonon dispersion , there are four soft modes with @xmath26 in a long wave - length regime in nws .",
    "these are dilatational ( longitudinal ) , flexural , shear and torsional ( transverse ) phonon acoustic modes .",
    "the doubly degenerate flexural mode represents a mixed state of transverse and longitudinal phonon acoustic modes . at low temperature ,",
    "the acoustic modes are mainly responsible for the electron - phonon scattering . based on the results of the numerical calculations ,",
    "we have introduced functions fitting the dispersion law of the acoustic modes . a comparison between our results and the dispersion law of the soft acoustic modes obtained by mizuno _",
    "et al._@xcite by means of the continuous medium approximation based on group theory is presented in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the continuous medium approximation would predict a quadratic behavior on the wave vector @xmath27 while our calculations yields a smaller exponent .",
    "the difference in the dispersion laws is mainly due to the fact that the continuous medium approximation does not take into consideration the surface elastic energy of nws .",
    "we convinced ourselves that the exponent of the dispersion law for the flexural modes increases with increasing nw thickness .",
    "for example , it is equal to 1.88 for a nw thickness of 2.7 nm . for the dilatational phonon modes , the dispersion law obtained in different models",
    "is the same , because the lateral nw sides do not influence the longitudinal elastic waves propagation .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] dispersion law of the soft acoustic phonon modes in the long wavelength regime in a square si nw . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the 2nd nearest neighbors , the expression for the hamiltonian matrix elements between @xmath28 orbitals is analogous to the one for 1st neighbors , @xmath29 for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 interactions , however , mixing of @xmath32 and @xmath33-type interactions , depending on the position of the 1st neighbor , needs to be taken into account .",
    "therefore we introduce an interpolation scheme following refs .   and  .",
    "first we define mutually orthogonal unit vectors @xmath34 pointing in the direction of the orbital @xmath35 at the 2nd neighbor .",
