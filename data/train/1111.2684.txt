    "the fact that black holes possess thermodynamic properties has been intriguing in gravitational and quantum theories , and is still attracting interest .",
    "nowadays it is well - known that black holes will emit thermal radiation with hawking temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the event horizon  @xcite .",
    "this result plays a significant role in black hole thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite opened up new insights about thermodynamic properties of black holes . in this context we expect that thermodynamic properties of conformal field theory ( cft ) matter on the boundary would respect those of black holes in the bulk . in particular , stationary black holes correspond to thermal equilibrium of the dual field theory at finite temperature equal to the bulk hawking temperature  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study if such thermal properties persist when time dependence is turned on . from a technical viewpoint ,",
    "the original derivation of the hawking radiation  @xcite was performed on a static or stationary background ( precisely speaking , as an approximation at late time ) , and it is not obvious how to accommodate dynamical spacetimes into the scheme . from a physical viewpoint , such a study can be useful since realistic black holes in our universe are dynamical or at least quasistationary .",
    "for example , processes like black hole formation after a gravitational collapse or black hole evaporation due to the hawking radiation may involve highly time - dependent phases , and it is not obvious how the hawking radiation will behave in such systems .",
    "when time dependence is sufficiently weak , however , we may expect thermodynamic properties of a black hole to persist .",
    "this expectation partially stems from physical insight on ordinary thermodynamics systems , in which thermodynamic properties persists when the system is sufficiently near equilibrium and quasistationary .",
    "if black hole thermodynamics is robust enough , such insight on usual thermodynamic systems leads to the above expectation on dynamical spacetimes and black holes .",
    "many studies have been made on generalizing hawking temperature for dynamical black hole approaches  @xcite , and they support such an expectation .    within the context of the ads / cft correspondence , thermodynamic properties of dynamical black holes",
    "lead to new insights into the dynamics of strongly coupled field theory on the boundary .",
    "one typical problem in this line is thermalization processes in the boundary field theory , which is holographically modeled by formation of the bulk black hole and its equilibration into a stationary state .",
    "much effort is devoted to such problems in connection with , for example , application of the ads / cft correspondence to qcd physics like that in the rhic experiment , or to nonequilibrium phenomena in condensed matter physics and fluid dynamics  @xcite . in this context , the hawking radiation in the bulk is interpreted as quantum fluctuation in the boundary theory , and it plays an important role in certain setups  @xcite .    based on these interests , in this paper we consider nonstationary spacetimes , and try to determine the hawking temperature measured by observers in the asymptotic region .",
    "one naive way to do this would be to define a certain time coordinate to associate temperature of the black hole ( future ) horizon to that measured by asymptotic observers .",
    "even though this procedure is seemingly natural from the viewpoint of black hole thermodynamics or horizon dynamics , it is puzzling from the viewpoint of causality , since this temperature is determined using information in the future region for that observer . in the ads",
    "/ cft setup , if we were to define temperature at a point on the boundary in this way , we would need information in the bulk region , which is not causally accessible from that boundary point .",
    "such a property would not be desirable if we care about causality in the bulk and boundary , especially when time dependence comes into the story .",
    "to avoid such problems , we consider the conventional derivation of the hawking radiation based on bogoliubov transformations for nonstationary background .",
    "an advantage of this method is that we can naturally determine temperature measured by asymptotic observers using only information causally available to them .",
    "particularly , we focus our attention on an eternal black hole rather than black hole formation by gravitational collapse because we are interested in near - equilibrium system such as transition from an equilibrium state to another equilibrium state .. ] in other words , we focus on late - time dynamics after the black hole has formed .",
    "we clarify how the hawking temperature changes when a black hole becomes dynamical , for instance , due to mass accretion to the black hole , and show that the hawking temperature of dynamical black holes can be naturally associated with `` surface gravity '' of the past horizon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    ", we should immerse the black hole into a thermal bath to realize this state . in asymptotically ads cases , on the other hand , it is naturally realized due to its boundary condition  @xcite because the black hole is enclosed in the ads boundary .",

    "the wave packet is peaked around a time @xmath30 with width @xmath31 , which are the time and duration of the observation , respectively .",

    "now , we recall that the two - dimensional part of the metric is given by @xmath196,\\ ] ] a coordinate transformation such as @xmath197 and @xmath198 to the double - null coordinates @xmath124 gives us the differential form @xmath199 where we have defined as @xmath200 .",
    "we consider a timelike vector field @xmath201 which characterizes a natural killing time in stationary regions and also in asymptotic regions near the boundary .",
    "note that frequencies of the killing modes are defined with respect to this killing time . by using the @xmath202-form it is rewritten as @xmath203 the tangent vector of outgoing null geodesics is given by @xmath204 where @xmath205 is an affine parameter , and",
    "then the geodesic equations lead to @xmath206 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath205 .",
    "we note that the last equation is equivalent to the coordinate condition @xmath207 defining the double - null coordinates .",
    "the `` killing energy '' @xmath208 associated with the null geodesics is defined by @xmath209 if @xmath210 is truly a killing field , @xmath208 should be constant along the null geodesics . from the geodesic equations we have @xmath211 where we have used @xmath212 . on the other hand , differentiating @xmath207 with respect to @xmath1",
    ", we have @xmath213 as a result , we find @xmath214 where @xmath215 is an integration constant which can be absorbed into normalization of the affine parameter . then , the `` killing energy '' can be rewritten as @xmath216 since the boundary conditions at @xmath162 are given by @xmath217 we have @xmath218 , which is the energy observed at the boundary , and @xmath219    using the geodesic equations , we also have @xmath220 integrating it along the outgoing null geodesics described by @xmath221 , we obtain @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the killing energy observed at an initial surface and the boundary , respectively .    consequently , for the outgoing null ray described by @xmath225 , we have the redshift factor from an initial time @xmath226 to asymptotic time @xmath227 as @xmath228 it turns out that if the spacetime is stationary , namely , @xmath172 does not depend on @xmath160 , we have @xmath229 . the redshift factor",
