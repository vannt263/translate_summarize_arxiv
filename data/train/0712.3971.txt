    "r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars comprise a sequence of hydrogen - deficient supergiants with effective temperatures from about @xmath0 k , as represented by zumi and dyper , to about 19,500 k , as represented by dycen .",
    "the characteristic of h - deficiency is shared by the h - deficient cool carbon ( hdc ) stars at low temperatures and by the extreme helium ( ehe ) stars at high temperatures .",
    "a common assumption is that the sequence hdc - rcb - ehe in the ( @xmath1 ) plane reflects a close evolutionary connection . in this sequence ,",
    "the rcbs are distinguished from hdc and ehe stars by their second principal defining characteristic : their propensity to fade , in visual light , unpredictably as a cloud of carbon dust obscures the star .",
    "this propensity is not universally shared : xxcam has yet to be observed below maximum light .",
    "in addition , dycen might be considered as an ehe star known to experience rcb - like fadings .",
    "if hdc , rcb , and ehe stars share a common heritage , the expectation is that their atmospheric compositions should show some common features @xcite .",
    "it is through the compositions that one hopes to test theoretical ideas about the origins of these extremely rare stars ; just five hdc , about 40 rcb @xcite , and 21 ehe stars are known in the galaxy .",
    "currently , two scenarios remain in contention to account for these h - poor high luminosity stars . in the first",
    ", a final he - shell flash in a post - agb star on the white dwarf cooling track creates a h - poor luminous star .",
    "this is dubbed the ` final flash ' ( ff ) scenario . in the second ,",
    "the h - poor star is formed from a merger of a he white dwarf with a c - o white dwarf . in a close binary system , accretion of the he white dwarf by the c - o white dwarf",
    "may lead to a h - poor supergiant with the c - o white dwarf as its core .",
    "this is called the ` double degenerate ' ( dd ) scenario .",
    "products of both the ff and dd scenarios may be presumed to exist . a determination of which scenario provided which star rests in large part on the observed chemical composition of a star s atmosphere and theoretical predictions about the ff and dd products .",
    "evidence from elemental abundances , especially the h , c , n , and o abundances , suggests that the rcb and ehe stars evolved via the dd rather than the ff route @xcite .",
    "convincing , essentially incontrovertible , evidence that the dd scenario led to the hdcs and some cool rcbs was presented by @xcite with their discovery that the @xmath2o was very abundant in their atmospheres .",
    "this usually rare isotope of oxygen was attributed to nucleosynthesis occurring during and following accretion of the he - rich material onto the c - o white dwarf .",
    "determination of the oxygen isotopic ratios demands a cool star with the co vibration - rotation bands in its spectrum .",
    "the majority of rcbs and all of the ehes are too hot for co to contribute to their spectra @xcite .",
    "an alternative tracer of nucleosynthesis during a merger may be provided by the fluorine abundance .",
    "considerable enrichment of ehe stars with f was discovered by @xcite from detection and analysis of about a dozen fi lines in optical spectra of cool ehe stars .",
    "clayton et al.s ( 2007 ) calculations suggest that f synthesis is possible in the dd scenario . here , we report on a search for fi lines in spectra of rcbs and discuss the f abundances in light of the results for ehes and the expectations for the dd and ff scenarios .",
    "high - resolution optical spectra of rcbs at maximum light obtained at the w.j .",
    "mcdonald observatory and the vainu bappu observatory were examined for the presence of fi lines .",
    "suitable mcdonald spectra of 13 rcbs were available for analysis .",
    "in several cases , spectra of the same star from different epochs were available .",
    "the stars are listed in table 1 . at vbo",
    ", spectra were obtained of uwcen , a star inaccessible from the mcdonald observatory , and also of xxcam , rcrb , rysgr , and vzsgr .",
    "the uwcen spectrum was complemented by a ctio spectrum from 1992 ( see asplund et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in the atmosphere of a rcb star , fluorine is present as neutral atoms .",
    "the leading lines of fi in optical spectra come from excited levels with lower excitation potentials of 12.7 ev or higher .",
    "the adopted @xmath3-values come from @xcite .",
    "the following fi lines were identified as the principal or leading contributor to a stellar line : 7398.68 , 7754.69 , 6902.47 , 7425.65 , and 6834.26 .",
    "the measured mean fluorine abundances ( table 1 ) are given as log @xmath4 , normalized such that log @xmath5@xmath6 = 12.15 where @xmath7 is the atomic weight of element @xmath8 .",
    "the errors of the derived f abundances given in table 1 are the line - to - line scatter .",

    "the analyzed rcbs ( excluding stars with upper limits to the f abundances and , uncertain f abundances ) have a mean f abundance of 6.7 which is the same for the analyzed ehes @xcite .",
    "thus , the f abundances are similar across an effective temperature range from about 6500 k to 14000 k , an indication that non - lte effects are possibly small .",
    "the f abundances of the analyzed rcb and ehe stars show no obvious trend with their abundances of other elements .",
    "more interestingly , the f overabundances are extremely large : enhancements of about 800 , 2500 , and 8000 at @xmath14(fe)@xmath15 , 6.5 , and 5.5 , respectively .      in the ` cold ' ( i.e. , no nucleosynthesis during the merger ) version of the dd scenario ,",

    "fluorine in pg1159 stars shows a range of abundances @xcite from solar to 250 times solar . as werner & herwig discuss , this range is not out of line with theoretical predictions for the he - intershell .",
    "but in the cold dd scenario , the he - intershell material is diluted , according to the canonical recipe , by a factor of about ten and , then , overabundances of up to 25 times solar for the rcbs and ehes are predicted .",

    "@xmath16f synthesis is demonstrated by @xcite which was briefly about 100 times above its solar abundance .",
