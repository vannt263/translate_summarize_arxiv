    "the vlba data also reveal the existence of diffuse emission on a scale considerably larger than the compact core and lobes seen in figure 2 . the shortest projected interferometer spacings of our vlbi experiment are about 180 k@xmath18 , where @xmath18 is the observing wavelength , corresponding to a resolution of about 1@xmath11 , and the source flux density increases to about 230 mjy on these spacings , comparable to the observed flux density on the longest vla spacings . in order to determine the distribution of this diffuse emission , we subtracted the clean component model of the source seen at high resolution in figure 2 from the visibility data set , and we imaged the residual visibilities using a gaussian taper with fwhm = 3 m@xmath18 , corresponding to data primarily from the inner - most antennas of the array ( the vla , pie town , los alamos , and fort davis ) .",

    "the absorption shows a clear velocity gradient from west to east , starting at @xmath24130 km sec@xmath1 at 100 mas west of the continuum peak , and moving to + 100 km sec@xmath1 at a comparable distance to the east of the continuum peak .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , unlike hi emission studies , hi absorption measurements depend both on the neutral gas distribution and the background continuum distribution .",
    "hence it is difficult to determine whether the fading of the hi absorption signal to the east and west is due to the lack of hi or the lack of continuum .",
    "we find that the peak opacity is roughly constant across the brighter regions of the source , with a value of about 0.18@xmath30.04 to a distance of at least 100 mas both east and west of the nucleus .",
    "the continuum surface brightness beyond a radius of 100 mas is too low to detect absorption in the current data .",
    "optical spectra of mrk 231 have revealed broad absorption line systems at heliocentric velocities of : cz = 4660 km s@xmath1 , 6250 km s@xmath1 , and 8000 km s@xmath1 ( boroson et al .",

    "the 4660 km s@xmath1 and 6250 km s@xmath1 systems have velocity widths of about 200 km s@xmath1 , while the system at 8000 km s@xmath1 has a velocity width of about 1000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "these systems show absorption by low ionization state species , such as nai .",
    "given that nai atoms have a lower ionization potential than hi , one might hope to see associated absorption in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen .    given the different velocity widths of the optical bal systems , we observed the two lower redshift systems with a velocity resolution of 21 km s@xmath1 , while the higher redshift system was observed with a velocity resolution of 87 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the absorption spectra are shown in figure 8 .",
    "no absorption was detected in any of the systems .",
    "the spectral rms for the two lower redshift systems is 0.7 mjy channel@xmath1 , while that in the spectrum of the higher redshift system is 0.6 mjy channel@xmath1 .",
    "the continuum flux density is 240 @xmath3 7 mjy , hence the 3@xmath20 optical depth limits per spectral channel are 0.009 for the two lower redshift systems , and 0.008 for the higher redshift system .",
    "the three important results from our high resolution imaging observations of the hi 21 cm absorption at 12642 km s@xmath1 toward mrk 231 are that : ( i ) absorption is _ not _ seen toward the vlbi core and lobes , ( ii ) absorption is detected toward a diffuse , elliptical radio continuum component which is centered on the nucleus and has a maximum size of 440 mas (= 260 h@xmath1 pc ) , and ( iii ) the absorption shows an east - west gradient in position and velocity of about @xmath3 110 km s@xmath1 out to radii @xmath25 100 mas ( 60 h@xmath1 pc ) .",
    "one plausible explanation of these three observed characteristics is that the neutral atomic gas , and the radio continuum emitting gas , are in a disk centered on the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , and that the disk is oriented not too far from the sky plane , and that the radio lobe axis is oriented perpendicular to the disk .",
    "we discuss this model in the following section ( see also figure 9 and the discussion at the end of section 4.2 ) .",
    "perhaps the strongest argument that the absorbing neutral hydrogen in mrk 231 is in a disk is the simple fact that such a gas disk has already been seen in the co molecular line images of bryant and scoville ( 1996 ) , and that the parameters for hi absorption are consistent with those of the molecular disk ( see below ) .",
    "the molecular observations show an elliptical distribution for the co , with a major axis of 1.2@xmath11 oriented east - west and a minor axis of 0.8@xmath11 .",
    "the molecular gas shows an east - west velocity gradient , ie . along the disk major axis . the molecular disk model of bryant and scoville",
    "is based primarily on the fact that , if the molecular gas was spherically distributed about the nucleus , the gas mass would greatly exceed the dynamical mass .",
    "they set a conservative upper limit to the disk inclination angle relative to the sky plane of :   @xmath26 @xmath27 59@xmath2 .",
    "they also show that a spherical distribution would lead to an a@xmath16 @xmath25 100 toward the nucleus , in conflict with the observed value of a@xmath16 @xmath25 2 ( boksenberg et al . 1978 ) .",
    "the hi observations presented herein show an east - west velocity gradient for the atomic gas that is similar in both magnitude and position angle to that seen for the molecular disk , although on a factor three smaller scale .",
    "we would then identify the observed hi gas with the inner regions of the molecular disk seen in co emission .",
    "we should emphasize that we can not rule out an outflow model to explain the hi velocity gradient , as opposed to rotation .",
    "one argument against outflow is that the atomic and molecular gas outflow axis would then be perpendicular ( at least in projection ) to the radio jet outflow axis .",
    "an hi disk not too far from the sky plane would provide a natural explanation for the lack of hi absorption toward the vlbi nucleus , and the southern ( approaching ) lobe .",
    "consider the simple example of a constant opening angle disk in which the half width of the disk increases linearly with radial distance from the center , with a constant of proportionality @xmath28 .",
    "the nucleus will be unobscured as long as :   cotan(@xmath26 ) @xmath15 @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , if we adopt a value of @xmath26 = 45@xmath29 ( see section 4.2 ) , then the nucleus and southern ( approaching ) lobe will be unobscured as long as the disk half width is less than the disk radius at any given radius .",
    "an additional factor in forming the ` hi hole ' toward the nucleus of mrk 231 could be ionization of the inner disk by the active nucleus ( section 4.2 ) .",
