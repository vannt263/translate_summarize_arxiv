    "the highly anisotropic organic conductors with their very rich phase diagram turn out to be excellent choice for exploring the phenomena of one - dimensional physics.@xcite it is well established theoretically that the conventional fermi - liquid ( fl ) theory of 3d metals does not apply to interacting electrons when the motion is confined to one dimension . instead , the luttinger liquid ( ll ) approach is valid , where the quasi - particle fl excitations are replaced by separate collective spin and charge excitations , propagating with different velocities.@xcite ll systems exhibit non - fl like power - law behavior in temperature and energy , and the exponents are interaction - dependent . when coupling between the chains is relevant , a crossover from the ll to a coherent ( fl ) behavior is expected as the temperature ( or frequency )",

    "the large planar tmt@xmath9f molecules form segregated molecular columns ( chains ) where the molecular orbitals overlap along the columns , giving rise to the highest conductivity direction ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the separation of the columns limits the coupling in the perpendicular directions .",
    "the anisotropy of the tight - binding overlap integrals along the three directions is @xmath17 for the high ( @xmath16 ) , intermediate ( @xmath18 ) and weak ( @xmath19 ) coupling / conductivity directions respectively.@xcite charge transfer of one electron from the chains to each of the anions results in quarter - filled hole bands on the tmt@xmath9f stacks ( or half - filled , if the dimerization along the chain is taken into account ) .",
    "it is also well known that exchanging se for s and/or using a different anion @xmath10 leads to the unified phase diagram for the ( tmt@xmath9f)@xmath1@xmath10series that spans from more anisotropic @xmath12 to @xmath11 , where the properties of one compound at a given pressure are analogous to those of another compound under higher pressure.@xcite    selenium based ( tmtsf)@xmath1@xmath10  salts exhibit a high conductivity at room temperature and a metallic behavior down to low temperatures , where the incommensurate spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ground state is established .",
    "like other @xmath12 salts that are more anisotropic , i.e.  more 1d , ( tmttf)@xmath1asf@xmath2  is typically 20 ( or more ) times less conducting than @xmath11 salts at room temperature.@xcite below a broad minimum near @xmath20k ( attributed to the opening of a charge gap @xmath21 and considered to be a continuous charge localization due to the anion potential  lattice dimerization ) , the resistivity of ( tmttf)@xmath1asf@xmath2  increases on cooling and the system becomes a very good insulator at low temperatures ( @xmath22k ) , where the spin - peierls transition occurs .",
    "the spin susceptibility remains unaffected by the charge localization despite the thermal activation of carriers below @xmath23 , indicating the decoupling between the spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "the anomaly in resistivity at @xmath24k has been recently clarified by the discoveries of the huge anomaly in the dielectric constant @xmath25 ( ref .  ) and of the charge ordering ( co ) seen by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , electron spin resonance ( esr ) and optical experiments.@xcite the nature of this phase transition was interpreted as a ferroelectric ( fe ) state , which is supported by the clear - cut fit of the anomaly in @xmath26 to a curie law .",
    "the fe transition is followed by a steep increase of the conductivity gap @xmath27 but with no appearance of a spin gap .",
    "there is still no general agreement whether the transport properties of quasi-1d ( tmt@xmath9f)@xmath1@xmath10  salts at high temperatures ( @xmath28k )  where the thermal energy exceeds the transverse coupling and the coherence for the interchain transport is lost  should be understood in terms of usual fl theory or ll theory.@xcite for example , there are indications of spin - charge separation by the similarity in the spin dynamics and thermal conductivity for @xmath12 and @xmath11 salts , but the electronic transport is very different .",
    "further , the absence of a plasma edge for polarization perpendicular to the chains in ( tmttf)@xmath1@xmath10  salts suggests that the electrons are confined on the chains , which is not the case for ( tmtsf)@xmath1@xmath10  compounds .",
    "however , while the dc conductivities along the chain axis @xmath16 in the latter compounds are metallic - like , the finite frequency response is not that of a simple drude metal and the optical conductivity data for ( tmt@xmath9f)@xmath1@xmath10  salts were interpreted as a strong evidence for non - fl behavior : the power law asymptotic dependence of the high frequency optical mode has been addressed to ll exponents.@xcite it was concluded that all the dc transport is due to a very narrow drude peak , containing only 1% of the spectral weight , whereas the remaining 99% is above an energy gap ( of the order of @xmath6@xmath29 ) and reminiscent of a mott insulating structure .",
    "these results agree with the ll theoretical predictions based on the doped hubbard chains , yielding a gap feature and a zero - frequency mode with a small spectral weight ( this mode is responsible for the metallic conductivity).@xcite one would expect that such a reduction of the carrier concentration @xmath30 ( participating in the dc transport ) should manifest itself in an enhanced value of the hall coefficient .",
    "however , so far the high temperature hall effect measurements were performed for ( tmtsf)@xmath1@xmath10  compounds only , and did not confirm these expectations ; moreover , the results for ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2were interpreted differently , i.e.  using the conventional fl theory @xcite and ll concept.@xcite recently , we have investigated the metallic state of ( tmtsf)@xmath1reo@xmath31 ( more anisotropic than the @xmath32pf@xmath2 ) , aiming to shed more light on fl or ll concepts from transport measurements and particularly hall effect.@xcite the pronounced conductivity anisotropy , a small and smoothly temperature dependent hall effect ( where the obtained @xmath5 values indicate that all the carriers contribute to the metallic - like transport ) and a small , positive and temperature dependent magnetoresistance were analyzed within fl and non - fl models : although not fully conclusive , these data nevertheless favor the fl description . we have also proposed that the possible appearance of the ll features in the transport properties should be found in the more anisotropic ( tmttf)@xmath1@xmath10  series , where the interchain interactions play a minor role .",
    "the present study of the temperature dependence of the resistivity anisotropy and the hall effect in ( tmttf)@xmath1asf@xmath2  is therefore a step forward in the identification of the ll features in the transport properties of @xmath12 compounds . in addition , our study gives strong evidence for a charge ordering transition from transport properties .",

    "the stronger temperature dependence of @xmath5 close to the phase transition followed by the change of sign ( indicating that the holes are participating in the electrical transport above and electrons below phase transition ) is a common feature in semiconductors.@xcite as the hall fields created by electrons and holes are opposing each other , it is apparent that the galvanomagnetic effects can have unusually strong temperature variations in regions where the resultant hall field is nearly null , when the relative electron - hole population is temperature dependent .",
    "below the co transition @xmath8 shows the rapid increase with decreasing temperature , i.e.  the hall coefficient is activated as expected for semiconductor .",
    "moreover , the activation energy agrees well with that obtained from the resistivity data .",
    "the question arises why the dramatic change in @xmath5 does not occur in the temperature range where the resistivity shows its minimum and the carriers become localized , as identified by the increase of the conductivity gap . instead",
    ", not much change is observed well below @xmath23 until charge ordering sets in at the transition @xmath85 .",
    "we propose the following interpretation : if one imagines that below @xmath23 the gap opens gradually upon cooling , the increase in @xmath8 indicates a decrease in number of carriers ( holes ) as long as @xmath151 .",
    "in the semiconducting phase around @xmath85  where @xmath152 , a transition occurs in which the carriers condense into an insulating charge - ordered state , i.e.our results reflect the exponential freezing out of the carriers below @xmath85 . in line with these , the abrupt change in @xmath8 around @xmath85 , where an increase of the conductivity gap @xmath153 occurs , demonstrates a phase transition to a charge ordered state .",
    "we have found clear evidence that the transport properties of ( tmttf)@xmath1asf@xmath2  at high temperatures ( @xmath28k ) can be understood in terms of the luttinger - liquid theory which describes 1d systems .",
    "this conclusion is based on the metallic - like resistivity along the @xmath33-axis only for @xmath154 , as well as on a good agreement with the power laws predicted for @xmath59 ( @xmath98 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath99 ) from existing ll model .",
    "further support comes from the constant value of the hall coefficient in the same temperature region , showing a strong reduction in number of carriers participating in dc transport . by comparing the results on ( tmttf)@xmath1asf@xmath2  with those for ( tmtsf)@xmath1@xmath10  systems ( where the ll power laws for the resistivity yield a more complex picture , while @xmath5 has much lower values ) we can infer that the high temperature transport properties in ( tmt@xmath9f)@xmath1@xmath10  salts change their behavior from a luttinger liquid to a fermi liquid when going from @xmath12 to se .    at lower temperatures",
    "the resistivity data show a semiconducting behavior for all three directions down to @xmath133k , where a charge - ordering transition occurs . this is characterized by a steep increase of the conductivity gap in the resistivity measurements for all three directions , although somehow stronger for the two axes perpendicular to the chains",
    ". this may be the consequence of the uniform shift of ions yielding a macroscopic fe polarization as predicted in analysis of dielectric measurements .",
    "however , the fact that no significant change in structural measurements was found below @xmath85  weakens this suggestion . on the other hand ,",
    "the steep increase of the conductivity gap below @xmath85 in resistivity manifests itself as an abrupt change in the @xmath8 behavior : the change of sign and the rapid increasing of its value with further temperature decrease is a strong indication that carriers condense into an insulating charge - ordered state .",
