    "consequently , a number of high - performance devices that exploit the soi effect have been proposed , including , spin transistors , and devices that store or transport information @xcite .",

    "there have also been extensive efforts to manipulate the spin currents@xcite in soi systems via the spin hall effect @xcite , and the quantum spin hall effect @xcite . since",

    "superconducting heterostructures have been making strides as potential platforms where spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) plays a key role , including scenarios involving the spin - hall effect @xcite . when considering superconducting hybrids with soc , interface phenomena at superconducting junctions becomes particularly important .",
    "for example , the interface of a hybrid superconducting junction can behave as a spin - polarizer when it is coated by an ultrathin uniform @xmath5 layer .",
    "the study of interface effects that involve spin - dependent scattering @xcite has spanned considerable theoretical @xcite and experimental works @xcite .",

    "the spin - parametrization scheme allows us to isolate the spin - singlet and spin - triplet correlations , and pinpoint their spatial behavior .",
    "we find that the combination of interface spin moment and isois results in triplet pairings with @xmath6 spin projections along the quantization axis @xcite .",
    "we also find that maximum singlet - triplet conversion and spin - current densities takes place at the corners of the @xmath1 wire nearest the spin - active interface , where the spin accumulation is greatest .",

    "we choose @xmath151@xcite as a representative value and emphasize that this specific choice has no influence on the generality of our findings . in the low proximity limit ,",
    "quasiparticles with low energies ( @xmath152 ) tend to have the main contributions to the pair correlations .",
    "accordingly , we therefore choose a representative value for the quasiparticles energy equal to @xmath153 .",
    "the other parameters are kept unchanged .",
    "as clearly seen , the combination of an isoi and spin moment of only one spin - active interface results in three nonzero components of the triplet correlations , which is in contrast to the case with zero isoi shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spncurrent_so_0 ] .",
    "this phenomena directly follows from the fact that the quasiparticle spin is tied to its momentum in the presence of an isoi.@xcite the singlet @xmath154 is minimum at @xmath16 and increases monotonically towards @xmath21 at every point along the junction width @xmath155 , and @xmath111 .",
    "this behavior can be understood by noting the combination of interface spin moment and isois at @xmath16 abruptly converts the singlet correlations into triplet correlations .",
    "this picture is however reversed at @xmath21 where an ingredient to the singlet - triplet conversion is lacking , i.e. , @xmath114 at @xmath21 .",
    "examining the spatial map of the triplet correlations in fig .",
    "[ fig : triplets ] , we find that the triplet correlations behave oppositely to the singlets .",
    "the triplet correlations @xmath156 are maximum near @xmath16 , where the @xmath0/@xmath1 interface is spin - active . here ,",
    "as remarked above , the combination of interface spin moment and isois effectively converts the singlet superconducting correlations into the triplet ones at @xmath16 .",
    "the triplet correlations decline as a function of @xmath86 , and eventually convert into the singlets at @xmath21 ( at the spin - inactive interface ) .",
    "the triplet correlations , @xmath157 , have nonzero spin - projections along the spin - quantization axis ( @xmath89 ) while @xmath91 for the @xmath158 component .",
    "it is evident that @xmath158 is drastically suppressed when moving away from the spin - active @xmath0/@xmath1 interface at @xmath16 ( a consequence of the so - called short - range behavior of @xmath158 ) .",
    "the spin-1 quantities , @xmath157 , on the other hand , remain nonzero over greater distances ( the so - called long - range behavior ) .",
    "the actual distances that the triplet correlations can propagate over them before fully vanishing in a system depends on the system parameters such as temperature , degree of the interface opacity @xmath159 , strength of the interface spin - activity and the magnitude of socs present in the system . nonetheless , a direct comparison of penetration depth between the triplet correlations with zero total spin @xmath158 and nonzero total spin i.e. @xmath157 clearly reveals that @xmath158 is the short - ranged triplet component while @xmath157 are long - ranged in the iso coupled @xmath0/@xmath1/@xmath0 junction with one spin - active interface .",
    "we note that this conclusion generally holds , independent of the representative values chosen .",

    "[ fig : triplets ] illustrates the superconducting correlations @xmath160 , and @xmath161 as functions of @xmath22-position along the junction width where @xmath162 , and @xmath111 . the spatial distribution of the singlet correlations along @xmath22 are unaffected by the coupling of the isois and interface spin moment at @xmath16 .",
    "the singlets , @xmath160 , are constant along @xmath22 , implying a uniform distribution along the junction width .",
    "this however differs considerably from the spatial behavior of the triplet correlations : the three triplet components @xmath161 demonstrate appreciable accumulation at the transverse vacuum boundaries of the @xmath1 wire ( at @xmath163 , and @xmath164 ) .",
    "also , the results reveal that the maximum singlet - triplet conversions occur at the corners of the @xmath1 strip near the spin - active interface ( near @xmath16 , @xmath163 and @xmath16 , @xmath164).@xcite further investigations have demonstrated that the maximum singlet - triplet conversion in such systems generally takes place at the corners of the @xmath1 wire near any spin - active interfaces.@xcite we note that this finding is generic , robust , and independent of either interface spin moment direction or the actual type of isoi considered .",
    "similar spatial profiles appear when @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , or equivalently when a dresselhaus soi is considered .",

    "the spin currents are zero at @xmath21 , where the @xmath0/@xmath1 interface is spin - inactive .",
    "this finding is also consistent with previous theoretical works where the spin currents were found to vanish at @xmath0/@xmath1 interfaces,@xcite and thus there were zero spin currents throughout the entire iso coupled @xmath0/@xmath1/@xmath0 hybrids . since the @xmath0/@xmath1/@xmath0 system considered here is in an equilibrium state , the time derivative of the spin density is equal to zero .",
    "@xcite therefore , because the singlet superconducting electrodes considered throughout the paper do not support spin currents , the divergence of the spin current at a @xmath0/@xmath1 interface is zero if the spin moment of the spin - active interface is zero ( spin - inactive interfaces ) .",

    "it is apparent that the spin current densities peak near the transverse vacuum boundaries of the @xmath1 wire at @xmath163 , and @xmath164 . considering the top and bottom panels together ,",
    "we conclude that the spin currents are maximally accumulated at the edges of the @xmath1 wire near the spin - active interface and approximately confined within @xmath176 .",
    "this in turn implies that the corners of the @xmath1 wire near the spin - active interfaces possess the maximum of spin current densities.@xcite the edge accumulation of spin current densities are reminiscent of those previously found in nonsuperconducting mesoscale junctions with isois .",
    "@xcite we emphasize that the previous works relied critically on externally applied magnetic and electric fields@xcite which can complicate the theoretical and experimental situations .",

    "the behavior of charge supercurrent in the low proximity limit considered here can differ from the ballistic regime where anomalous supercurrent - phase relations were found @xcite .",
    "these findings offer an appealing experimental platform to examine pure edge spin currents , not accompanied by charge currents , solely by modulating @xmath7 without imposing an external electromagnetic field on the system .    a spin - active @xmath0/@xmath1 interface can be ordinarily fabricated by coating a superconductor with a spin - active layer .",
    "@xcite the signatures of triplet pairings can be experimentally probed by means of tunneling experiments and scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) techniques@xcite , which rely on zero - energy peaks in the proximity - induced density of states@xcite .",
