    "the axion has rich implications for astrophysics and cosmology . in origin , the axion is a pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson of the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry , which is introduced to the standard model as a solution to the strong cp problem in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . below the qcd scale @xmath10mev , the axion acquires a mass from the instanton effect @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the axion decay constant .",
    "couplings to other particles are also suppressed by @xmath12 , which is constrained from various terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations .",
    "the most stringent lower bound @xmath13  gev comes from the duration time of neutrino burst from sn 1987a @xcite .    on the other hand , @xmath12 is also bounded from above based on cosmological considerations . while couplings of axions to other particles are very week , they can be copiously produced in high - energy environments in the early universe .",
    "these axions contribute to the energy density of dark matter .",
    "if inflation @xcite , which is essential in current understanding of our universe , takes place in the early epoch and the pq symmetry is broken during and after inflation , the axion field becomes homogeneous over the observable universe apart from quantum fluctuations , and undergoes coherent oscillation after the qcd phase transition with an initial value @xmath14 .",
    "such coherently oscillating axion behaves as cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and should not dominate over the observed energy thereof . from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and other cosmological observations ,",
    "the abundance of the cdm is precisely constrained , which gives a current bound on the decay constant @xmath12 as @xmath15  gev @xcite .",
    "if the pq symmetry is not restored after the inflation , the isocurvature fluctuation of axion leads to significant cmb anisotropies .",
    "the amplitude of axion isocurvature perturbation is proportional to the hubble parameter in the inflationary epoch @xmath16 , and recent observations give a constraint @xmath17  gev for @xmath18  gev and misalignment angle @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "realizing such an inflation model is generally difficult and requires fine tuning of parameters .",
    "this calls up another possibility , where the pq symmetry is restored during or after the inflation .",
    "this happens rather naturally in the supersymmetric inflation models where the effective mass of @xmath20 is induced for the pq scalar through supergravity effect and ( if it is positive ) restores the pq symmetry .",
    "other models to restore the symmetry during inflation have been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "since the pq symmetry is a global u(1 ) symmetry , linear topological objects called axionic strings can form when it breaks spontaneously .",
    "when the spontaneous breaking of u(1)@xmath21 occurs in the universe , a cosmological network of axionic strings is formed .",
    "the axionic string is a global string and an extended object with physical width @xmath22 .",
    "while local strings can be accurately simulated by using the nambu - goto action , it is difficult to simulate the dynamics of global strings using string - based actions and evolution of the string network has been poorly understood .",
    "a crucial feature that makes global strings different from local strings is that a long - range force mediated by massless ng boson operates between two global strings .    in general ,",
    "a scaling solution is characterized by the scaling parameter @xmath23 , which we define as @xmath24 @xmath23 is nothing but the average number of infinite strings in a hubble volume ( strictly speaking , in a box with a volume @xmath25 ) and should be a constant of order of unity as long as a scaling solution is realized . for local strings",
    "we find @xmath26 from the simulations based on the nambu - goto action  @xcite and @xmath27 from field - theoretic simulations  @xcite in the radiation dominated universe . whereas @xmath23 can be much smaller for global strings @xcite .",
    "in addition , the energy stored in global strings is released in a different way from local strings . ng bosons dominantly carry away the energy in global strings , while gravitational waves play the dominant role for local strings .",
    "there has been a controversy about the energy spectrum of axions radiated from axionic strings .",
    "davis , shellard and co - workers insist that the spectrum has a sharp peak at the horizon scale @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , sikivie and co - workers claim that it is proportional to the inverse momentum @xcite .",
    "after the qcd phase transition , radiated axions finally become cdm and their energy density is proportional to the number density .",
    "the energy spectrum of axions is of particular importance since the number density of radiated axions is determined by the spectrum .",
    "a solution for the controversy was given by yamaguchi , kawasaki and yokoyama @xcite ( hereafter yky99 ) . in their analysis ,",
    "a field theoretic simulation of axionic string was performed , which is a first - principles calculation and least contaminated by theoretical uncertainties .",
    "their analysis showed that the energy spectrum of axions from strings are sharply peaked at a momentum around inverse of the horizon scale and suppressed exponentially at higher momenta .",
    "therefore the observed shape of the spectrum is in good agreement with the insistence by davis , shellard and co - workers .",
    "in addition , yky99 showed that a scaling solution is also realized for global strings and find a much smaller scaling parameter @xmath28 compared with local strings .",
    "has been obtained @xcite . ]",
    "this illuminates the quantitative difference in dynamics of global strings from local strings .",
    "our primary purpose of this paper is to update the analysis of yky99 .",
    "while we perform a field theoretic simulation of axionic strings of largest scale so far , we also develop several new techniques to improve the accuracy of analysis .",
    "one is a new method for identification of strings in a simulation box . for field",
    "theoretic simulation , this is a non - trivial task since field values are known only at discrete spatial points . by checking the consistency with the previous identification methods , reliability of our understanding of string dynamics would be much improved .",
    "in addition , we introduce a pseudo power spectrum estimator ( ppse )  @xcite to remove the contamination of string cores in estimation of the energy spectrum of radiated axions .",
    "since strings are highly - energetic objects , reliable estimate of the energy density of free axions is difficult near string cores .",
    "therefore we should remove the regions near strings in estimation of the energy spectrum . in yky99 ,",
    "this was done by dividing the simulation box into eight sub - boxes with the same size and estimating the spectrum using only selected sub - boxes with no strings . in order to take a larger simulation box and",
    "increase the statistics ,",
    "we need a more effective way to remove string cores . this can be done by adopting ppse , which is often used in power spectrum estimation in cmb data analysis to remove observed regions contaminated by foregrounds including galactic emission and point sources  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we first give details of our model and the setup adopted in our field theoretic simulation . then we describe our analysis method in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "particularly , we focus on methods adopted in identification of strings and estimation of the energy spectrum . results of our analysis are presented in section [ sec : results ] , where we mainly discuss the scaling property of axionic strings and the energy spectrum of radiated axions from strings .",
    "comparison with the previous result of yky99 is also discussed here .",
    "a constraint on @xmath12 and implications for the early universe are discussed in section [ sec : constraint ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussions .    in this paper , we assume flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe , with a metric @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scale factor",
    ". we also use a conformal time @xmath31 .",
    "a dot represents derivative respect to the proper time , _ i.e. _ @xmath32 .",
    "we simulate dynamics of a complex pq scalar field @xmath33 with a lagrangian density @xmath34,\\ ] ] with an effective potential at finite temperature @xmath35 @xmath36=    \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(|\\phi|^2-\\eta^2)+\\frac{\\lambda}{3}t^2|\\phi|^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the energy scale of pq symmetry where @xmath38 is the number of degenerate vacua after qcd phase transition . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath39 , so that axionic domain walls quickly disappear after the qcd phase transition ( otherwise , it is cosmologically disastrous ) . ] and @xmath40 is the self - coupling constant . the same potential is also adopted in yky99 .",
    "when the temperature is high enough @xmath41 , @xmath42 has a minimum at @xmath43 and u(1)@xmath21 is restored . at lower temperature @xmath44 , symmetry breaking minima",

    "the phase transition is of second order .",
    "while we consistently adopt a particular set of model parameters @xmath46  gev , @xmath47 in our simulation , different choices of these parameters do not lead to any qualitative differences in physical consequences .",

    ", we generate an initial condition for @xmath33 and @xmath53 . at high temperature @xmath54",
    ", @xmath55 is approximately in thermal equilibrium , so that @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be regarded as gaussian random variables . by decomposing @xmath55 into the real and imaginary parts , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath57 , correlation functions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the energy of a fourier mode with wave number @xmath62 , with the mass of @xmath55 being denoted as @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath64 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be either @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "we also note that in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : initphi])-([eq : initphicross ] ) , we omit the contribution of vacuum fluctuations , which would not affect the classical dynamics of @xmath55 .    the equation of motion for @xmath55 is given by @xmath69    \\phi(\\vec x , t)=\\frac{\\partial v_\\mathrm{eff}}{\\partial\\phi^ * } ,     \\label{eq : eom}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the hubble rate . in our simulation , we integrate eq .   using the second order leapfrog scheme with a constant conformal time - step @xmath71 .",
    "the background universe is dominated by radiation . there , the friedmann equation is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) . in our simulation , we take it constant , @xmath74 , following yky99 .",
    "our lattice simulation has the number of grids @xmath75 , which is larger than any other previous simulations .",
    "we impose a periodic boundary condition and the physical size of our simulation box at the end time @xmath76 is taken to @xmath77 times the horizon scale @xmath78 . with this choice of the box size , massless axions , which begin to be emitted at @xmath50 , travel for a distance less than half the size of our simulation box until @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we can avoid axions from overlapping around the box and causing unphysical boundary effects via the long range force mediated by them . in this setup ,",
    "the physical size of lattice spacing at the end time @xmath76 turns out to be @xmath79 .",
    "finally we comment on the dynamical range of our simulation . on one hand",
    ", our simulation box should be larger than the horizon , whose comoving size scales as @xmath80 , in order to avoid boundary effects .",
    "on the other hand , the lattice spacing should be sufficiently smaller than the string width , whose comoving size scales as @xmath81 ; otherwise , strings can not be resolved in the simulation box .",
    "as @xmath30 becomes large , it turns out to be impossible to satisfy both of these two demands due to the finiteness of @xmath82 .",
    "these determine the dynamical range .",
    "our field - theoretic simulation is a first - principles calculation and free from theoretical uncertainties .",
    "several difficulties , however , arise in extracting the physically relevant quantities from the given data of @xmath55 and @xmath56 at discrete points . as discussed in introduction , identification of strings and estimation of energy spectrum of axions",
    "are of primary importance .",
    "so we describe the details of these matters in this section .",
    "several methods for string identification have been developed so far . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a lattice was identified as a part of a string based on the value of the potential energy there .",
    "counting number of lattices thus identified as containing strings , they estimated the scaling parameter .",
    "although the overall features were traced reasonably well , this method had some problems in that string segments were occasionally found disconnected and it might overestimate the scaling parameter because the number of the lattices penetrated by a string was used rather than the length of the string itself .",
    "later , two of the present authors ( my and jy ) developed a new method of string identification @xcite , which uses the phase of the fields . in this method , first a quadrate , which a string penetrates , is identified by dividing the phase into three zones with unequal spans or @xmath59 takes the same sign at its four corners .",
    "so the authors of @xcite had to divide the phase into uneven zones .",
    "nevertheless it did not cause any artifacts in the final results . ] and monitoring the phase rotation just as in the vachaspati - vilenkin algorithm @xcite .",
    "then , the position of the string in each quadrate is determined by the zeros of the two real fields , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these complicated identification scheme guarantees the connectedness of strings and makes it possible to calculate the string velocity , the intercommutation rate , and the ng boson emission rate as well as the scaling parameter more precisely .",
    "thereby it enables us to analyze the evolution of the string network from the lagrangian viewpoint to clarify its fundamental characters .",
    "however , we did not assign an equal range @xmath83 of the relative phase to all zones because we would occasionally identify a quadrate as containing a string even if either @xmath58 or @xmath59 takes the same sign at its four corners .",
    "such a biased ( uneven ) assignment of the relative phase may cause some artificial effects .",
    "fortunately , we found no significant differences , although we tried another division of the relative phase .",
    "the complete connection of the strings are indispensable for the purpose of ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , to clarify the quantitative nature of the cosmological evolution of a global string network from a lagrangian viewpoint .",
    "however , in this paper , we have only to find a quadrate that a string penetrates and to estimate an accurate value of the scaling parameter .    for our practical purposes",
    "here , however , we do not need to adopt such a complicated and time - consuming procedure albeit its accuracy , because the final error is dominated by the finiteness of the simulation box rather than the identification scheme we use .",
    "we therefore adopt a new and much more efficient method in which we do not need to divide the phase into fixed uneven zones .",
    "therefore , we introduce a new method that is appropriate for the present purpose . *",
    "[ what does ` relax ' means ? ] *    let us start by considering a small quadrate whose four vertices are the neighboring grids in the simulation box ( see the left panel of figure [ fig : identify ] ) . since the field values @xmath33 at these vertices ( a , b , c and d in the figure ) are known from simulation , we can map these vertices into the field space ( right panel of the figure ) . while there are several ways to take a region of phase which contains the images of these four vertices",
    ", we denote the range of minimal one by @xmath84 , which is explicitly shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : identify ] .",
    "as shown in the figure , if a string penetrates the quadrate , @xmath84 should be larger than @xmath85 .",
    "this can be easily understood by drawing a line on the quadrate running through the penetration point of the string . when the quadrate is small enough for the continuous change of the phase to be regarded as isotropic around the string , the phases at opposite sides of an arbitrary line intersecting the penetration point ( for example , lines of @xmath86 and @xmath87 shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : identify ] ) differ by @xmath85 .",
    "whatever line we draw , each region of the quadrate divided by the line contains at least one vertex .",
    "therefore , the minimal phase difference can not be smaller than @xmath85 . as long",
    "as the continuous phase change around strings is isotropic , the opposite is also true , _ i.e. _ if @xmath88 , the quadrate is penetrated by a string",
    ". therefore we can use @xmath84 as a criterion for identification of strings .",
    "one interesting point is that our method is also applicable for any convex polygons other than quadrate .",
    "in addition , our method is invariant under the global rotation of the phase of @xmath55 , which is a desirable feature in identification of global strings .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : spec ] shows the energy spectra of radiated axions at @xmath89 ( left ) and @xmath90 ( right ) , that are estimated from the 20 realizations used in section [ sec : dynamics ] .",
    "the amplitude of energy spectrum at @xmath91 is about @xmath92 times that at @xmath93 .",
    "this is because the energy density of free axions scales as @xmath94 , without emission or absorption .",
    "we see a clear exponential behavior at large @xmath95 after the removal of the contamination from strings .    as we see in section",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] , the system of axionic strings are already in the scaling regime .",
    "most of axions at this epoch are however emitted before the settlement into the regime . in order to extract the energy spectrum of axions radiated during the scaling regime , we need to differentiate the energy spectra at different times .",
    "we define the differential spectrum of radiated axion between @xmath93 and @xmath91 , @xmath96 if there are no emission nor absorption of axions , the energy density of axion scales as @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , @xmath97 is the net energy spectrum of axions radiated from strings .    in figure",
    "[ fig : diffspec ] , we plotted the differential spectrum between @xmath93 and @xmath91 .",
    "we observe that the net energy spectrum is sharply peaked at around the horizon , which corresponds to @xmath98 at @xmath99 ( @xmath100 at @xmath101 ) , and its amplitude is exponentially suppressed toward higher @xmath95 .",
    "this is consistent with yky99 .    to calculate the number density of axions created from strings ,",
    "the important quantity is the mean reciprocal comoving momentum of radiated axion defined by @xmath102 by fitting the ratio of @xmath103 to the horizon scale @xmath104 , we obtain @xmath105 this is consistent with @xmath106 obtained by yky99 . however , the uncertainty is reduced by an order of magnitude owing to the increase in statistics , which is brought about by use of ppse .",
    "using the result of the previous section , we can derive a constraint on @xmath12 .",
    "after the pq phase transition , the system of axionic strings reaches the scaling regime and continuously emit massless axions . after the qcd phase transition , the axionic string - wall system is generated .",
    "after @xmath107 , when the tension of axionic domain walls @xmath108 starts to dominate the system , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath109 , the wall - string system quickly disappears .",
    "emission of axions from strings continues until @xmath107 , and the largest fraction of the axions are produced just before @xmath107 .",
    "after @xmath107 , axions becomes non - relativistic due to the finite mass .",
    "today , axions exist as cdm in the universe .    in appendix [ app : energy ] , we give a detailed derivation of the density parameter of cdm axions radiated from axionic strings , adopting the axion mass at finite temperature from recent studies @xcite . by substituting eqs . and obtained from our simulation into eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the dilution factor , the number of relativistic d.o.f . at @xmath107 , and the scale of the qcd phase transition , respectively ( see appendix [ app : energy ] ) .",
    "@xmath114 should be smaller than the observed @xmath115 .",
    "recent cosmological observations @xcite give @xmath116 ( assuming flat power - law @xmath113cdm model ) .",
    "therefore we can translate eq . into constraint on @xmath12 . assuming no entropy dilution ( @xmath117 ) , we obtain @xmath118 gev at 2 @xmath119 level . by taking account of uncertainties in the qcd phase transition",
    ", a conservative constraint would be @xmath120 our constraint is a few times tighter than one given in yky99 .",
    "this is partially because of the precise @xmath115 obtained from recent observations , which was not available at the time of yky99 , and also of the axion mass at finite temperature from  @xcite , which is slightly smaller ( hence larger @xmath107 ) than that adopted in yky99 .",
    "we also note that while the error in @xmath23 of eq . can be smaller if it is estimated at earlier times @xmath121 , this does not affect our final consequences much ; the error in the energy density of axion cdm in eq",
    ". can decrease at most 40% and the upper bound on @xmath12 does not change .",
    "using field theoretic simulation , we have investigated the dynamics of strings and the energy spectrum of axion radiation from strings , which was previously done by yky99 .",
    "our lattice simulation has a higher resolution than that of any other previous studies .",
    "we have also introduced several new techniques in order to improve accuracies of the previous analysis .",
    "we have developed a new identification method of strings in simulation box , which uses the minimum phase difference among neighboring grid points in quadrates .",
    "the estimated scaling parameter @xmath122 shows good agreement with other previous studies .",
    "the consistency among completely different identification methods would suggest that these results are conclusively robust .    in estimation of the energy spectrum of axions radiated from strings ,",
    "we have also introduced a new method to obtain larger statistics .",
    "we have verified our new method using ppse , by checking consistency with the spectrum calculated from sub - boxes in the simulation box found without strings .",
    "the differential energy spectrum obtained from our lattice simulation peaks sharply around a horizon scales and damps exponentially toward higher wave numbers .",
    "this shows good agreement with yky99 , and support the discussion of davis and shellard @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the horizon scale and the mean energy momentum of radiated axion is @xmath123 . using these results ,",
    "we have obtained a constraint on the axion decay constant @xmath124 gev .    above constraint on @xmath12 counts only axions radiated from strings .",
    "however , axions are also radiated from axionic domain walls .",
    "this gives a constraint @xmath125 gev @xcite , which is also severer than in the original papers due to the more precise observationally inferred value of @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , the oscillation of zero mode of axion field also contributes to the energy density of cdm axions in the present universe , which gives @xmath126 gev @xcite .",
    "combination of these constraints would give @xmath127 gev , as long as there occurs no entropy dilutions after the qcd phase transition .",
