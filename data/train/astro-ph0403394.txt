    "thermonuclear x - ray bursts are produced when helium on the surface of an accreting neutron star ignites unstably ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the accreted material itself is usually hydrogen .",
    "the helium is produced because the accreted hydrogen is compressed and heated by the column of material above it , and begins to burn steadily via the cno cycle .",
    "eventually , the critical temperature and density are reached such that he can burn via a triple-@xmath2 process .",
    "the burning is unstable , and engulfs the entire surface of the neutron star in less than a second .",
    "this results in a @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 flash of x - rays that out - shines the emission from the accretion flow for tens of seconds .",
    "these bursts recur on time scales of hours to days , and so multiple bursts have been observed from the neutron stars in @xmath5 low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the unstable burning is likely to begin in a small region on the neutron star , and so it has long been expected that the resulting hot spot should produce modulations in the burst flux at the spin period of the neutron star . indeed , `` burst oscillations '' have now been observed with _ rxte _ from 13 neutron star lmxbs ( table  [ tab : init ] ) .",
    "there are several reasons to believe that the burst oscillations occur at the spin frequencies of the neutron stars .",
    "first , and most importantly , two of these sources are x - ray pulsars , which exhibit periodic modulations in the persistent emission between bursts at the same frequency as the burst oscillations @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of all of the oscillations are characteristic to each source , and are distributed uniformly between 270 and 620 hz .",
    "second , once one accounts for a small frequency drift ( described below ) the burst oscillations are nearly coherent @xcite . in one case ,",
    "the oscillations are observed to be coherent for @xmath6 cycles during a carbon superburst @xcite .",
    "third , the maximum frequencies of the oscillations are stable to within a few parts in a thousand in bursts separated by several years @xcite .",
    "fourth , the oscillations are strongest in the rises of bursts , when the nuclear burning is likely to be confined to small areas on the surfaces of the neutron stars @xcite . finally , in the tails of the bursts , the amplitudes of the oscillations as a function of energy are consistent with those expected from temperature variations of @xmath7 kev across the surface of the neutron star @xcite . as signals from the surfaces of neutron stars",
    ", these oscillations can be used to study the evolution of the spin frequencies of accreting neutron stars , the spacetime around the star , and how thermonuclear burning proceeds on the stellar surface .",
    "however , the simplest models of inhomogeneous burning fail to explain two aspects of the oscillations , which are illustrated in figure  [ fig : freqev ] .",
    "first , the oscillations persist for up to 15 s during a burst , long after the burning should have engulfed the entire surface of the neutron star .",
    "second , they drift upward in frequency by up to 5 hz during the course of a burst , which suggests that the brightness pattern moves opposite the sense of the rotation , such that @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain one or both of these aspects of the oscillations .",
    "the upward sense of the frequency drift could be explained by the conservation of angular momentum in an expanding burning layer @xcite . under this model ,",
    "the energy released in the first second of the burst causes the burning layer to expand and slow relative to the rotation of the neutron star .",
    "the frequency drift is observed as the burning layer cools and re - couples to the rest of the neutron star , causing the frequency of the oscillations to increase .",
    "unfortunately , it appears that too little energy is released during a burst to cause the burning layer to expand to the height required to explain the observed frequency drifts ( compare * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an additional frequency drift could be produced by accounting for the propagation of the cooling front after the fuel has been exhausted @xcite .",
    "if the burst ignites near the rotational equator , then as the burst cools the pressure at the poles is likely to be larger than at the equator .",
    "the pressure gradient and the coriolis force would then combine to generate a zonal flow opposite the rotation of the neutron star , in the same manner as the trade winds are formed on earth . as",
    "the entire surface cools , the velocity of the flow should slow .",
    "any brightness patterns    .sources of burst oscillations [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "observations with _ rxte _ have clearly established that the oscillations observed during thermonuclear x - ray bursts occur at the spin periods of the underlying neutron stars , and have provided tantalizing clues as to how nuclear burning proceeds on the surfaces of neutron stars . in the short term",
    ", it would be helpful to address outstanding theoretical questions , such as the expected frequencies of rossby - alfvn modes , and the amount the oscillation signals are attenuated by scattering as they propagate away from the neutron star .",
    "however , a future x - ray timing mission truly is needed to bring these initial observations to their full potential by making several crucial observations .",
    "first , oscillations are currently only observed from 12 of @xmath5 bursting lmxbs , and are only observed from about half of the bursts from any given source .",
    "the difference between the amplitudes of the detected oscillations and the upper limits to the non - detections is only a factor of two @xcite , so a future mission with a larger effective area could greatly increase the number of neutron stars with burst oscillations , and consequently with known spin periods . a larger sample would be important for understanding the distribution of observed spin periods , and thus for exploring why all neutron stars appear to be rotating significantly below their break - up frequency @xcite .",
    "second , if the burst oscillations are indeed produced by modes in the surface layers , a future x - ray timing mission should detect a spectrum of signals with different latitudinal and radial wave numbers .",
    "the spacing of these modes would allow us to measure the pressure , density , and composition of the burning layers on a neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      oscillations . for instance , a dipolar ( @xmath9 ) temperature distribution on a neutron star should produce oscillations that are slightly - non sinusoidal , because the flux then would be distributed as @xmath10 ( figure  [ fig : dipole ] ) . these harmonics would be just below the detection threshold of _ rxte _ , but would be easily detectable with a timing mission with larger area . as is discussed by tod strohmayer in these proceedings , the harmonic content of the oscillations is crucial to constraining the compactness of the neutron star , and hence its equation of state",

    "<S> i review the basic phenomenology and theory of the millisecond brightness oscillations observed during thermonuclear x - ray bursts from 13 of @xmath0 accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> compelling observations indicate that the oscillations are produced by surface brightness patterns on the rapidly rotating neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains to be understood ( 1 ) why the brightness patterns producing them persist for up to 15 s during an x - ray burst , whereas the burning should cover the entire surface in less than 1 s , and ( 2 ) why the frequencies drift upward by @xmath1 hz during the course of the burst . </S>",
    "<S> these peculiarities can probably be explained by taking into account the expansion of the surface layers caused by the burning , zonal flows that form due to pressure gradients between the equator and poles , and rossby - alfvn modes that are excited in the surface ocean . </S>",
    "<S> further progress toward understanding how burning progresses on the surface of the neutron star can be made with a next - generation x - ray timing mission , which would provide a larger sample of sources with oscillations , detect sideband signals produced by the spectrum of modes that should be excited in the neutron star ocean , and measure harmonic structure in the profiles of the oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> these observations would be crucial for measuring the distribution of the rotation rates of neutron stars , the progression of unstable nuclear burning in the accreted ocean , and the curvature of the space - time around the neutron star .    </S>",
