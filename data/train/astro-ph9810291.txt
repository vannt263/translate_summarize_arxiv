    "precisely observed sn ia light curves , most published sn ia photometry , before 1980 , consisted of infrequently sampled photographic light curves for sne within @xmath10 km s@xmath1 with a wide assortment of filters and emulsions ( van den bergh 1994 ; cadonau & leibundgut 1990 ; barbon , cappellaro , & turatto 1989 ) .",
    "much of this data is plagued by systematic errors from non - linearities in detector sensitivity , uncertain transformations to modern filter conventions , and difficulties with background light subtraction .",
    "a crude estimate of these photometry errors comes from comparing the dispersion in sandage & tammann s ( 1993 ) hubble diagrams constructed with old photographic light curves ( 0.65 mag ) with those based on more modern @xmath11-band sn ia observations ( 0.38 mag ; hamuy et al .",

    "it is also important to maintain a telescope - detector setup throughout the observations which well matches standard passband conventions ( johnson & harris 1954 ; bessell 1990 ) since the non - stellar spectrum of an sn ia can make linear color corrections inexact . the most challenging obstacle to producing a high - quality sn ia light curve is to account correctly for the background light from the host galaxy _ at the position of the supernova_.    recent evidence has shown that sne ia are not perfectly homogeneous in luminosity or color and that the intrinsic luminosity and color is intimately related to the _ shape _ of the observed light curves ( phillips 1993 ; riess , press , & kirshner 1995a , 1996a ; riess et al .",

    "they find that oversubtraction or undersubtraction of a constant flux source leads to an observed correlation between sn ia light curve speed and inferred luminosity .",
    "if the value of this correlation were the same as the intrinsic correlation , then using the light - curve shape to correct the luminosity could equally well account for either intrinsic luminosity variation or galaxy contamination .",
    "unfortunately , they are not the same , so it is crucial to account correctly for the background light to determine the true light - curve shape . sn ia light curves obtained by the caln / tololo survey show that with high quality photometry , it is possible to measure distances with sn ia light curves to a precision approaching @xmath125% ( hamuy et al .",

    "the @xmath14-band ccd transmission extends to substantially longer wavelengths than the cousins ( 1980 , 1981 ) and bessell ( 1990 ) convention for the @xmath14 photomultiplier passband .",
    "the flwo ccd transmissions are very similar to ccd transmission functions obtained by bessell with the filters he prescribed ( bessell 1990 ) .",
    "we use linear color corrections to account for differences between our ccd transmission functions and the johnson / cousins photomultiplier passbands .",
    "still , broad emission and absorption features in the spectral energy distribution of sn ia can cause variations among light curves observed with slightly different ccd transmission functions .",
    "the difference between broad - band sn ia photometry obtained at flwo and ctio has been determined in detail by smith et al .",

    "these differences ( with uncertainties in parenthesis ) , as shown in table 1 , are small , but not entirely absent .",
    "agreement between flwo and ctio is best in the @xmath16 passband .",
    "a small number of the observations reported here were conducted at the 0.62 m telescope at the capilla peak observatory ( cpo ) .",
    "the 0.62 m is a @xmath21 boller & chivens cassegrain telescope matched with a rca model sid501ex back - illuminated and thinned ccd .",
    "the ccd pixels are 30 microns square , corresponding to 0.67 arcseconds per pixel at prime focus .",
    "the cpo ccd transmission functions are shown by beckert & newberry ( 1989 ) and are a good match to the ccd transmissions at flwo . the mean difference in sn ia photometry obtained at flwo and cpo",
    "is shown in table 1 using sn 1995d .",
    "the difference is very small in @xmath16 and somewhat larger in @xmath22 and @xmath14 .",
    "approximately 10 of the more than 1200 photometric observations were collected at other observatories including the michigan - dartmouth - mit observatory , the mcdonald observatory , the mcgraw hill observatory , the lick observatory , and ctio as noted in the photometry tables .    a well - sampled sn ia light curve requires monitoring every day or two near maximum light and every few days as it changes more slowly a fortnight after maximum .",
    "weather and moonlight often intercede even when an observatory is well - organized and well - instrumented to gather these observations .",
    "fortunately , photometric weather is not required since we can use stars in the sn field as local calibrators to monitor the changing brightness of the sn ia through differential photometry .",
    "optimal comparison stars are the brightest stars in the field which do not saturate the ccd electron wells during the long sn ia exposures at late times when the supernova has dimmed .",
    "comparison stars obviate the need to make first - order airmass corrections and allow the sn ia brightness to be measured in any weather conditions for which the supernova is visible .    on nights which are photometric , we performed all - sky photometry from which we constructed a transformation from our detector measurements to the standard photometric conventions . following hardie ( 1962 ) and harris et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , we used transformation equations which gave the apparent magnitude as a linear combination of the instrumental magnitude , observed airmass , and color . using all - sky standard stars from landolt ( 1992 )",
    "we then solved for the linear coefficients of the transformation equations .",
    "the typical @xmath23 scatter of our transformations was 0.02 mag , with no observed correlation between residuals and color , airmass , or instrumental magnitude .",
    "the mean color terms for the flwo 1.2 m were 0.04 , -0.03 , -0.08 , and 0.06 mag in @xmath20 and @xmath14 per mag of @xmath24 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these transformations were employed to calibrate the apparent magnitudes of the comparison stars which were observed on the same night as the landolt standards .",
    "the comparison stars used for each sn ia field are marked in figure 2 and their @xmath20 and @xmath14 apparent magnitudes are given in table 2 . for two fields ( as listed in table 2 ) , only one `` primary '' comparison star was consistently visible in the field of view .    for each night",
    "a sn ia was observed , we measured the brightness of the supernova relative to one or more comparison stars in the field .",
    "extreme care was exercised to subtract properly the background light at the location of the supernova .",
    "for sne ia far from the galaxy , or on a smooth and uniform region of the galaxy , reliable background subtraction was easily accomplished . in such cases ,",
    "we generally measured the background light from the median sky value contained in an annulus of width @xmath12 6@xmath27 at an inner distance of @xmath12 8@xmath27 from the center of the supernova .",
    "these separations were increased as needed for data from nights with poor seeing .",
    "more challenging were sne ia located on a luminous and mottled galaxy background . in this case , unless images of the galaxy existed prior to explosion , the only reliable way to proceed was to wait for the sn ia to fade away to obtain an image of the galaxy without the supernova .",
    "then by carefully matching the alignment , intensity , and point - spread functions of the images with and without the sn ia present , we subtracted the two images to obtain an image of the supernova with zero background ( schmidt et al .",
    "this is the same method used for the photometry of high - redshift sne ia ( riess et al .",
    "1998b ) .    to measure the brightness of the supernova relative to the comparison stars in an uncrowded field we used the method of aperture photometry .",
    "we added the light contained in a series of apertures of increasing radius around the star and supernova and found the difference in magnitude between the sn ia and the comparison star which was independent of aperture radius .",
    "the estimated background was varied until a difference in magnitude was found which was independent of aperture radius .",
    "this procedure is refined for crowded fields or faint sne ia where we have fit point spread functions ( psfs ) to the sn ia and comparison stars to determine their relative brightness .",
    "experience has shown that when either technique is suitable , the aperture method and the psf method give consistent results within @xmath28 mag .",
    "the particular method used to derived the photometric measurements for each sn is listed in table 3 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath14 band photometry for 22 sn ia light curves is given in tables 6 through 27 and plotted in figure 3 .",
    "for each observation we include an estimate of the 1 @xmath29 error which was determined from poisson statistics , image quality , and uncertainty in the calibration of the comparison stars . in most cases",

    "we have obtained spectra of each of these sne ia from the flwo and after thorough examinination we have found that each was of type ia as defined by branch , fisher , & nugent ( 1993 ) and filippenko ( 1997 ) .",
    "two objects , sn 1995ac and sn 1995bd , displayed similar spectral characteristics as the peculiar sn ia 1991 t including strong fe iii and weak si ii absorption ( garnavich et al .",
    "many of these sne ia have been previously utilized for a variety of cosmological measurements as discussed in  1 .",
    "nearly all of these applications make use of estimates of the luminosity distances to these sne ia .",
    "the discussion of the most precise way to infer these distances has evolved from the assumption of homogeneity ( leibundgut 1988 ; branch & miller 1993 ; sandage & tammann 1995 ) to methods which account for the correlation between light - curve shape and luminosity ( riess , press , & kirshner 1995a ; hamuy et al . 1995,1996a ) and employ multiple passbands to separate the effects of dust on sn ia light from those of luminosity ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996a ; riess et al .",
    "these methods are continually evolving and improving and the specific values of the distance related parameters will likely be superseded regularly .",
    "for this reason , we explore characteristics of this sample which are largely independent of the sn distances .    in figure 4 we show histograms of the supernova redshifts , peak apparent magnitude , epoch of first observation , number of observations , absolute magnitude determined from the luminosity / light - curve parameter , and line - of - sight extinction . for comparison",
    "we include the same statistics for the 27 sne ia from the caln / tololo supernova survey ( c / t ) .",
    "the cfa sample has a redshift range of @xmath32 with a mean redshift of @xmath33 .",
    "as seen in figure 4 , the redshifts are concentrated at lower values , though most are within the hubble flow : in the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , 17 of the 22 sne ia have @xmath34 km s@xmath1 . for the c / t sample",
    "the redshift range is @xmath35 with a mean of @xmath36 .",
    "the following sample characteristics are derived from multi - color light curve shape ( mlcs ) fits to the @xmath18 data as described by riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996a ) and reanalyzed by riess et al .",

    "figure 4 shows a histogram of the absolute magnitudes as inferred from the mlcs light - curve shape fits on the cepheid distance scale ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996a ) .",
    "the range of luminosities implied for the cfa sample is @xmath41 with a mean of @xmath42 ; the c / t sample has @xmath43 with a mean of @xmath44 .",
    "a true sn ia luminosity function can only be derived from a sample of sne ia with well understood selection criteria ( reiss et al .",
    "figure 4 also shows the distribution of visual band extinctions as inferred from the mlcs measurements of reddening .",
    "this distribution is strongly peaked toward low extinctions , with three notable exceptions ( sn 1995e , sn 1995bd , and sn 1996ai ) each having more than one visual magnitude of obscuration .",
    "one of these , sn 1995bd , is expected to have 1.5 mag of visual extinction from the milky way galaxy ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .",
    "four more objects ( sne 1993ac , 1996bv , 1996bo , and 1996bk ) have 0.5 - 1.5 mag of visual extinction .",
    "while the completeness and biases of the cfa sn ia sample are not easily defined , it is still interesting to combine these supernovae with the c / t sample to look for patterns in a large data set . figure 5 shows the extinction and light - curve shape parameters as a function of supernova galactocentric distance and host galaxy type .",
    "host galaxy extinction decays rapidly with projected separation from the nucleus and with the progression to earlier type galaxies .",
    "the multicolor light - curve shape parameter ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996a ) shows that slow decline rates ( @xmath45 ) dominate at small galactocentric distances and that there is a general trend , first pointed out by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , for faster decline rates for supernovae occurring in early - type galaxies .",
    "figure 6 shows the distribution of absolute magnitude for sne ia in the hubble flow versus projected separation from the host galaxy .",
    "when no correction is made for extinction or light - curve shape , the luminosity variation is similar to that found by wang , hflich , & wheeler ( 1997 ) ; there is a large dispersion at small galactocentric distances which decreases outward .",
    "however , when the luminosity is corrected for total extinction ( figure 6b ) from mlcs , sne with projected separations of less than 10  kpc are found , on average , to be brighter by about 0.3 mag than those further out .",
    "because the projected separation is the minimum distance the supernova can be from the galaxy center , the few faint objects at small projected separations could be at even larger galactocentric distances .",
    "elliptical hosts dominate the sample at large separations , so the decrease of sn ia luminosity in early - type hosts found by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996a ) may contribute to this trend .",
    "when the luminosity is corrected for both extinction and light - curve shape , no trend with galactocentric distance is apparent .    a hubble diagram of the 17 sne ia from the cfa sample with @xmath46 km s@xmath1 is given in figure 7 .",
    "these distances were derived with the mlcs method ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996a ) as prescribed by riess et al .",
    "( 1998b ) in @xmath47 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the dispersion of these distances is @xmath48 mag . as noted by zehavi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the sne ia within @xmath49 7000 km s @xmath1 ( log@xmath50 ) exhibit the dynamic complement of a local void : an increased expansion rate relative to the more distant sne ia ( see also tammann 1998 ) .",
    "for these sne ia , the difference between the expansion rates within and beyond @xmath51 km s@xmath1 is 7% .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sense of this change in the expansion rate is opposite to what would be caused by a selection bias that emphasizes more luminous supernovae at larger distances .",
    "the observed effect corresponds to a higher hubble constant inferred locally .",
    "if a more statistically significant sample of sne ia upholds this hint of a local void , it would help explain why sne ia yield a lower hubble constant than distance indicators that refer to more local volumes ( freedman et al . 1998 ; jacoby et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the 22 @xmath18 sn ia light curves presented here are composed of 1210 individual observations , and comprise some of the most highly sampled illustrations of the photometric history of sne ia in the hubble flow .",
    "a histogram of the number of observations for each sn ia is shown in figure 4 .",
    "standouts include sne 1994ae , 1995d , 1995al , 1995bd , 1995ac , and 1996x , each with 80 to 100 observations beginning before maximum and extending 60 to 100 days after maximum .",
    "figure 8 shows @xmath18 composite light curves formed by normalizing the data in time and brightness at the fit to the initial peak , including a correction for @xmath52 time dilation and a @xmath53-correction ( hamuy et al . 1993 ) . by affixing the light curves at maximum , their inhomogeneity is readily apparent .",
    "for example , in @xmath11 the light curves exhibit a decline in @xmath11 15 days after maximum [ @xmath54 of @xmath55 mag and in @xmath14 the time and brightness of the second maximum exhibits considerable variations . these and other features of the light curves have been shown to correlate with the luminosity and colors of sne ia ( phillips 1993 ; riess , press , & kirshner 1995a , 1996a ; hamuy et al .",
