    "cortical activity manifests highly complex behaviors which is often strongly characterized by the presence of noise .",
    "reliable responses to specific stimuli often arise at the level of population assemblies ( cortical areas or cortical columns ) featuring a very large number of neuronal cells presenting a highly nonlinear behavior and that are interconnected in a very intricate fashion . understanding",
    "the global behavior of large - scale neural assemblies has been a great endeavor in the past decades .",
    "most models describing the emergent behavior arising from the interaction of neurons in large - scale networks have relied on continuum limits ever since the seminal work of wilson and cowan and amari @xcite .",
    "such models tend to represent the activity of the network through a macroscopic variable , the population - averaged firing rate , that is generally assumed to be deterministic .",
    "many analytical and numerical results and properties have been derived from these equations and related to cortical phenomena , for instance for the problem of spatio - temporal pattern formation in spatially extended models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this approach tends to implicitly make the assumption that correlations in the activity do not modify the behavior of the system in large populations .",
    "however , the stochasticity of the system , and in particular the presence of correlations in the activity may considerably affect the dynamics in such nonlinear systems , and these can be even more important as the network size increases .",
    "these models therefore make the assumption that averaging effects counterbalance the prominent noisy aspect of _ in vivo _ firing , a feature that can dramatically affect finite - sized network activity , and , thus , that the emergent behavior of a cortical column is deterministic .",
    "however , increasingly many researchers now believe that the different intrinsic or extrinsic noise sources are part of the neuronal signal , and rather than a pure disturbing effect related to the intrinsically noisy biological substrate of the neural system , they suggest that noise conveys information that can be an important principle of brain function @xcite . at the level of a single cell , various studies have shown that the firing statistics are highly stochastic with probability distributions close to poisson distributions @xcite , and several computational studies confirmed the stochastic nature of single - cells firings @xcite . how variability at the single neuron level affects dynamics of cortical networks is less established so far .",
    "theoretically , the interaction of a large number of neurons that fire stochastic spike trains can naturally produce correlations in the firing activity of the population considered .",
    "for instance power - laws in the scaling of avalanche - size distributions have been studied both via models and experiments  @xcite . in these regimes",
    "the randomness plays a central role .",
    "a different approach has been to study regimes where the activity is uncorrelated .",
    "a number of computational studies on the integrate - and - fire neuron showed that under certain conditions neurons in large assemblies end up firing asynchronously , producing null correlations @xcite . in these regimes , the correlations in the firing activity decrease towards zero in the limit where the number of neurons tends to infinity .",
    "the emergent global activity of the population in this limit is deterministic , and evolves according to a mean - field firing rate equation .",
    "however , these states only exist in the limit where the number of neurons is infinite , and such asynchronous states do not necessarily exist in cortical areas or in computational models , and even when they exist , they are not necessarily stable .",
    "this raises the question of how the finiteness of the number of neurons impacts the behavior of asynchronous states , and how to study non - asynchronous behaviors .",
    "the study of finite - size effects in the case of asynchronous states is generally not reduced to the study of mean firing rates and can include higher order moments of firing activity @xcite . in order to go beyond asynchronous states and take into account the stochastic nature of the firing and how this activity scales as the network size increases , different approaches have been developed , such as the population density method and related approaches @xcite .",
    "most of these approaches involve expansions in terms of the moments of the resulting random variable , and the moment hierarchy needs to be truncated which is a quite hard task that can raise a number of technical issues ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "a recent approach overcomes this truncation difficulty by considering the mean - field behavior as a stochastic process and therefore treating the rigorous limit equation of the interaction of many stochastic neurons as a fixed point equation in the space of stochastic processes , making use of the powerful tools of stochastic limit theorems and large deviation techniques ( see @xcite ) .    in order to study the effect of the stochastic nature of the firing in large network",
    ", many authors strived to introduce randomness in a tractable form .",
    "the models we will be interested in are based on the definition of a markov chain governing the firing dynamics of the neurons in the network , where the transition probability satisfies a differential equation called the _",
    "master equation_. seminal works of the application of such modeling for neuroscience date back to the early 90s with the work of ohira and cowan @xcite , and have been progressively developed by different authors and today constitute a model of choice  @xcite .",
    "the present manuscript is based on the analysis of two recently developed stochastic models of the customary wilson and cowan equations.the global resulting activity is then readily derived from the activity of all neurons in the network .",
    "the two models of interest here were instantiated specifically in order to be compared to standard wilson and cowan rate equations , and provide tractable stochastic extensions of the purely deterministic standard neural - field models @xcite .",
    "the two approaches differ in the choice of the transition probability and on the variables considered , choices mainly based on the fact that they address two different regimes of network activity : buice , cowan and chow address the highly correlated poisson - like activity and bressloff , the asynchronous states",
    ". the two approaches also differ in the way the equations are treated : buice , cowan and collaborators in @xcite derive moment equations by carrying out a loop expansion of a path integral representation of their master equation whose truncation is justified under the assumption that the network operates in a poisson - like regime .",
    "bressloff rigorously justifies his moment truncation by exhibiting an expansion in powers of a small parameter @xmath0 where @xmath1 corresponds to the size of the network .",
    "these different points of view lead the authors to define different variables and they obtain closely related yet different equations on the variables they define , derive equations for moments from the master equation which they then simplify and truncate to finite order .    the present paper is organized as follows : in the first section",
    "we describe the models we use .",
    "both simplified models introduced involve coupling between mean firing rate and correlations between firing times , with finite - size correlations . in the second section ,",
    "we are interested in the non - zero correlation solutions of the mean - field equations , and , in particular , focus on the qualitative similarities and differences between the solutions of these stochastic equations compared to the customary wilson and cowan behaviors . in the third section",
    ", we turn to study the finite - size effects , namely the qualitative differences between the solutions of mean - field limits and wilson and cowan system on one hand , and the behaviors of large but finite networks on the other hand .",
    "these finite - size solutions are compared back to the initial markovian model and the differential equations they produced .",
    "in this section , we introduce and describe the master equation formalism used by buice , cowan and collaborators @xcite ( hereafter bcc ) and bressloff @xcite and extend these approaches to take into account different populations .",
    "both models have been previously derived , so we quickly present their derivation and the resulting equations in this section , as our main purpose is to derive from these equations our model of interest , the _ infinite - size model _ , and to mathematically analyze it .",
    "details on the derivation of these equations and on their theoretical justification can be found in  @xcite .    throughout manuscript",
    ", we will be interested in a network structured into @xmath2 homogeneous neural populations .",
    "each population @xmath3 is composed of @xmath4 neurons , and the total number of neurons is denoted by @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath5 ) .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the network when the number of neurons @xmath1 tends to infinity . in this limit",
    ", we assume that the proportion of neurons belonging to each population are non - trivial , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "each neuron of population @xmath7 interacts with all the neurons of the network , with an efficiency denoted @xmath8 . these weights are assumed to scale as @xmath9 , so that a given activity at the level of population @xmath7 will produce a bounded activity at the level of population @xmath10 .",
    "we therefore define the effective interconnection weights @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "each population is assumed to receive an input firing rate @xmath13 considered deterministic and constant in the rest of the paper .",
    "the wilson and cowan ( wc ) model is based on the assumption that the synaptic input current to each population is a function of the firing - rate of the pre - synaptic population , and that the contributions of the different populations are linearly summed to produce the post - synaptic population firing rate .",
    "it assumes moreover that the population - averaged firing rates @xmath14 are deterministic function of time that are governed by the equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a function transforming an incoming current into an output firing rate and typically has a sigmoidal shape .",
    "@xmath17 are the relaxation rates corresponding to the natural inactivation of each population when they receive no input .",
    "this purely deterministic approach , often used for spatially extended neural networks , has proved efficient to model a large number of cortical phenomena , but fails to reproduce the stochastic behaviors that can appear at the level of population activity .",
    "we now describe the stochastic framework used by  @xcite to extend this framework in order to take into account the stochastic nature of the firing .      in the markovian approach yielding bcc and bressloff models ,",
    "each neuron can be either quiescent or active ( active meaning in the process of firing an action potential ) , and the state of the network is then described by the variable @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of active neurons in population @xmath7 .",
    "this chain is modeled as a one - step discrete - time markov process , i.e. the only possible transitions of this chain are assumed to be @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "each active neuron of population @xmath7 returns to a quiescent state with constant probabilistic rate @xmath17 and each quiescent neuron become active with a state - dependent rate @xmath22 depending on the inputs the neuron receives .",
    "the probability of the network to be in a state @xmath23 at time @xmath24 therefore satisfies a differential equation called the _ master equation _ : @xmath25\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] from this equation the authors derive equations on the moments of the markov chain .",
    "we propose in appendix [ append : rodigtuck ] an alternative derivation of the moment equations based on a langevin approximation of the rescaled markov chain and on the use of rodriguez and tuckwell expansions  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we are particularly interested in a variable that would correspond in the markov setting to the proportion of active neurons in each population : @xmath26 for @xmath27 , which is _ a priori _ a well - behaved bounded stochastic process that takes values in the interval @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "having defined this variable , we will be in a position to rescale bcc and bressloff variables , and obtain from their derivation the equation governing this variable .",
    "in doing so , as further illustrated below , we will not need to derive new moment equations from the master equation , but it will appear as a change of variable in the set of ordinary differential equations these authors previously obtained .",
    "in this view , the rescaled mean firing rate is defined as the instantaneous averaged proportion of active neurons in each population @xmath29 , and rescaled correlations as the average value of the correlations of the proportion of active neurons in each population @xmath30 , the two first moments of the process @xmath31 .    the equations for the moments involve averaged values of @xmath32 which , since the activation is not polynomial , involve all the moments of the variable @xmath23 , and therefore need to be truncated in order to obtain a closed set of equations .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath33 is so far unspecified and will be defined in order to recover the wc equations in the mean - field uncorrelated limit .    with the aim of specifically investigating ( uncorrelated ) asynchronous states , bressloff truncates the moment series expansion up to second order , and considers the evolution of two coupled variables : the mean firing - rate @xmath34 and @xmath35 a correlation variable differing from our variable in that it is scaled by @xmath36 .",
    "after taylor expansion and a van - kampen system - size expansion , a specific choice of the activation function @xmath33 is made so that one ends up with the following set of ordinary differential equations : @xmath37\\delta_{ij } - ( \\alpha_i+\\alpha_j)\\,n_{ij } \\\\          &",
    "\\qquad+ \\sum_{k } [ f_i'(s_i ) w_{ik}\\,n_{kj } + f_j'(s_j ) w_{jk}\\,n_{ki } ]      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 corresponds to the firing rate of population @xmath7 : @xmath38 and @xmath39 are defined as the correlations @xmath40 . in the original formula , the number of neurons of each population is assumed to be equal to @xmath41 .",
    "this quantity is bounded by application of kurtz theorem  @xcite , and therefore the term @xmath42 tends to zero as @xmath1 tends to infinity , implying that the equation of the mean becomes independent of the correlations @xmath39 .",
    "since we are interested in the statistics of the proportions of active neurons in each population , we are in a position to derive from the original bressloff equations the system of equations governing our variables @xmath34 and @xmath43 formally , and obtain in a multi - population case with distinct population sizes : @xmath44\\delta_{ij } - ( \\alpha_i+\\alpha_j ) c_{ij } \\\\          & \\qquad+ \\sum_{k } [ f_i'(s_i ) w_{ik}\\ , c_{kj } + f_j'(s_j ) w_{jk}\\ , c_{ki } ]      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] in both equations and , we denoted by @xmath45 the total instantaneous current received by population @xmath7 at time @xmath24 : @xmath46 we note that the system , though derived from bressloff s master equation and formalism , is equivalent to the original bressloff model as long as the total number of neurons @xmath1 is finite , since it was derived through an invertible change of variable which is invertible as long as @xmath1 is finite , but not invertible in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "buice , cowan and collaborators  @xcite ( bcc case ) , interested in studying the poisson - like firing modes of the network , transform the moment equations to derive equations of _ normal ordered cumulants _ measuring the deviations of the moments of the variable @xmath23 from pure poisson statistics .",
    "the first normal ordered cumulant is equal to @xmath48 , the second ordered cumulant to @xmath49 .",
    "the initial approach of buice , cowan and collaborators is not a finite - size expansion _",
    "per se _ in the general case , hence the parameter according to which the expansion is performed is no longer @xmath0 as in the case of bressloff s van kampen expansion , but consists of a multiple time scale expansion where the small parameter is the decay time of normal order cumulants ( which applies far from bifurcation points ) .",
    "however , in the fully connected case we are interested in in the present manuscript with weights scaling as @xmath0 , the expansion provided buice , cowan and collaborators method can be reduced to a finite - size expansion , and can be compared to bressloff s case . in terms of these variables after some approximations and moment truncation to the second - ordered cumulant , they end up with the following set of ordinary differential equations ( this step involves an instantiation of the activation functions @xmath33 different from the bressloff case ) : @xmath50    we note that the rescaling does not affect the form of the equations obtained in @xcite .",
    "these equations are valid under our assumptions that the synaptic weights @xmath8 scale as @xmath0 in a fully connected network .",
    "we emphasize the fact that both expansions can be rigorously derived far away from bifurcation points . in the manuscript",
    ", we will however be interested in the bifurcations of the dynamical systems given by and .",
    "indeed , these bifurcations produce changes in the number and in the stability of attractors ( fixed point and limit cycle ) which will be visible in non - trivial parameter intervals , and therefore will affect the behaviors of the system far away from bifurcations and will give us indications of the number and stability of attractors in those parameter regions .",
    "these models formally appear to very similar .",
    "however , it is important to note that the these two approaches are different : the master equation corresponds to different transition rates ( different choices of the functions @xmath33 as stated ) , and the variables considered differ . the two equations and constitute our starting point for a mathematical exploration of the solution , and in the rest of this paper , we mathematically analyze these equations .",
    "the reader nevertheless needs to keep in mind the differences between the two approaches for interpreting the results .      the equations and are _ a priori _ different .",
    "first of all , they do not deal with the same quantities : equation couples the mean firing - rate and the correlations while equation the mean firing - rate and the first order cumulant .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath51 , the first - order cumulants , @xmath49 , are simply equal to the correlation @xmath43 . moreover , in the rescaled models we introduced , we observe that when the number of neurons tends to infinity , both bressloff and bcc models converge to the same equations .",
    "these equations will be referred to as the _ infinite size model _ and are given by the equations : @xmath52      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] we recall that although the interpretation of the variable @xmath53 differs in the general case , it is the not the case of the infinite model : in bcc model @xmath54 are the second ordered cumulant , while in bressloff model @xmath55 is the correlation in the firing activity , and in the infinite - size limit , the normal ordered cumulant is equal to the correlation .",
    "however , when @xmath1 becomes finite , the reader needs to bear in mind that in the finite - size unfolding of the infinite - size equations in bcc case , @xmath53 represents the deviation of spike statistics from a poisson process and in bressloff model the covariance of the firing activity . when letting @xmath1 be finite ,",
    "the two models unfold the behavior of the system in a different fashion .",
    "we also note that if the variable @xmath56 is equal to zero , then the mean - firing rates @xmath14 satisfy the wc equations . in that view ,",
    "bressloff and bcc models are generalizations of wc system that take into account the correlations in the firing .    in this paper , we will first be interested in studying the mean - field limit solutions of the infinite size equations , and second in unfolding these mean - field behaviors when the number of neurons is large but finite .",
    "our study will particularly focus on two main aspects : ( i ) how the stochastic nature of the firings affect the observed behaviors at the macroscopic level through the interplay of firing activity and the correlations , and ( ii ) how the finiteness of the number of neurons in the network disturbs these behaviors .",
    "we also note that in view of kurtz theorem @xcite , our variable in the infinite - size system vanishes .",
    "we formally consider these equations independently of this restriction . in other words ,",
    "the infinite - size system is obviously not equivalent to the wc system , but bcc and bressloff systems should be equivalent , in this limit , to wc system .",
    "the study of the infinite - size system will allow us to find what we call _ correlation - induced behaviors _ , which are qualitative distinctions between the behaviors of the solutions of the infinite - size system and of wilson and cowan system .",
    "if these behaviors are unfolded non - trivially into solutions of the finite - size equations , these will evidence additional behaviors of the system presented by the finite - size bressloff and bcc equations that do not correspond to solutions of wilson and cowan system .",
    "we will address these questions in in section [ sec : finitesize ] .    besides our theoretical analysis on the equations",
    ", we will also go back to the initial markovian model and compare ( with monte carlo simulations ) the stochastic behaviors it presents to the solutions of wc , bcc and bressloff models .",
    "we have shown that in the limit where number of neurons is infinite , both bressloff and bcc models , in our particular rescaling , converge to the infinite - size model given by equations where the mean - firing rate is coupled to the correlations in the firing activity . when the correlations are equal to zero , the equation for the mean - firing rate is uncoupled from the one for the correlations @xmath53 and is identical to the wc system .",
    "the question we address in this section is how the interaction between the mean activity and the correlations modifies the behavior of the global activity compared to wc system given by equations .",
    "we address the following two questions : ( i ) are the solutions of wilson and cowan equations also solutions of the full systems including correlatons , and if the answer is yes , are the stability properties of these solutions conserved ? and ( ii )",
    "do the correlations yield other behaviors ?      in equation , it is easy to see that zero correlation : @xmath57 is always a fixed point of the correlation equations no matter what mean firing rates @xmath58 are . for zero correlations , the equations for the mean",
    "firing rate @xmath59 are reduced to the classical wc equations . therefore , wc solutions define solutions for the infinite - size system with zero correlations .",
    "let us now study the stability of the solutions defined by these uncorrelated wc behaviors in the infinite size system .",
    "the infinite - size system involves a standard @xmath2-dimensional differential equation on the mean firing rates @xmath58 coupled to a matrix differential equation . in order to use customary approaches for dynamical systems ,",

    "the variable @xmath84 satisfies the differential equation in @xmath85 : @xmath86    the differential equation governing the evolution of the coefficients of the correlation matrix @xmath56 of the infinite size system can be easily reordered into : @xmath87 which , through straightforward linear algebra manipulations , can be written as : @xmath88 the linear operator @xmath89 for @xmath90 can be written in terms of kronecker product of matrix on the vectorized version @xmath84 of the matrix @xmath56 using the relationship given in and we have : @xmath91    now that we have defined a convenient framework to study the infinite size equations , we are in position to study the stability of fixed points and limit cycles of the wc system as solutions with zero correlations of the infinite size system .",
    "we start by addressing the problem in the one population model ( @xmath92 ) , which allows straightforward calculations and will be helpful in our specific study of the one population infinite - size equation .",

    "we therefore conclude that any stable solution of the one dimensional wc equation provides a zero correlation ( @xmath95 ) stable fixed point of the infinite - size system , and we observe that no stable solution of wc system is destabilized by the presence of correlations , and no unstable solution of the wilson and cowan equation will be stabilized .",
    "therefore , zero - correlation fixed points of the infinite size system exists if and only if wilson and cowan equation has a fixed point , and the related fixed point of the infinite - size system has the same stability as wc s fixed point .",

    "this loss of exponential stability does not necessarily mean that the cycle loses stability , and this property depends on the higher order terms of the nonlinear equation , but even if the cycle keeps stability , the transient convergence phase towards the cycle will be dramatically slowed .    in this section ,",

    "let us now analyze how this picture is modified by the presence of correlations .",
    "first of all , from theorem [ thm : wilsonbuicecowan ] , it is clear that the parameter point where wc system undergoes the supercritical hopf bifurcation will be a very degenerate bifurcation point for the infinite - size system .",
    "indeed , the hopf bifurcation is characterized by the presence of a pair of purely imaginay complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "then lemma [ lem : ckron ] and the fact that the kronecker sum of two matrixes has all pairwise sums of eigenvalues of the matrixes in the sum ( see appendix [ append : kronecker ] ) directly implies that the jacobian matrix of the full system has the eigenvalues @xmath187 and the eigenvalue @xmath188 is of multiplicity one .",
    "therefore at this point , the jacobian matrix of the infinite size system has its @xmath179 eigenvalues having a null real part , and thus at this point the system is very degenerate and in particular the bifurcation is not a generic hopf bifurcation .",
    "it is quite difficult numerically and analytically to study the solutions emerging from this bifurcation point , and many solutions can appear at this point , including cycles and fixed points .",
    "similarly , at the two saddle - node bifurcations of wc system , since the jacobian matrix of the infinite - size system has all the pairwise sums of the eigenvalues , it will have two null eigenvalues and therefore a degenerate bifurcation .",
    "the behavior of the system around these degenerate points will appear more clearly in the finite - size unfolding of these degenerate bifurcation points , and we will observe in particular that the hopf bifurcation point corresponds to the merging of two generic hopf bifurcations and the saddle node bifurcations to the merging of two generic saddle - node bifurcations , see section  [ sec : negfeedback ] and figure fig .  [",
    "fig : codim2bc2pops ] . in this section",
    "we do not address here the problem of classifying all behaviors of the system around the bifurcation ( since as already mentioned , the finite - size unfolding will help answering these questions ) , and restrict the analysis to the question of whether the wc cycle keeps a nonlinear stability in the new system . to answer this question ,",
    "we numerically perturb wc s cycle by adding a small initial condition in the correlations .",
    "interestingly , we observe that a new cycle appears , that is attractive in a certain range of parameters ( see figure  [ fig : cyclesmeanfield2pops ] )",
    ". the wc cycle does not completely loses stability and still appears as the only behavior of the system in a certain range of input values ( e.g. @xmath184 as plotted in figure  [ fig : cyclesmeanfield2pops](b ) ) .",
    "but for smaller values of the parameters , it loses its nonlinear stability and the additional cycle appears ( e.g. @xmath189 and figure  [ fig : cyclesmeanfield2pops](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this new cycle is totally different in its shape , has a period close to half the period of the cycle corresponding to wc system , and has non - zero correlations that vary periodically at the same frequency .",
    "a continuation of this branch of cycles shows that it is stable in a significant range of parameters ( figure  [ fig : cyclesmeanfield2pops](e ) ) .",
    "it loses stability when @xmath190 decreases through a period - doubling bifurcation , and as @xmath190 increases through a neimark - sacker bifurcation .",
    "this branch of limit cycles emerges from the very degenerate point corresponding to the hopf bifurcation of wc system , as we expected .",
    "it disappears at a point corresponding to a subcritical hopf bifurcation with correlations ( on a branch of unstable fixed points that is not plotted in the diagram but that will be further investigated in section [ sec : twopopsfinite ] ) .",
    "+    we conclude with a further observation on transient behavior .",
    "we have seen that wc s cycle was neutrally stable , but in some regions of parameters , it has nonlinear stability . in the region of parameters where the wc cycle is nonlinearly stable ( white region in figure [ fig : cyclesmeanfield2pops](d ) ) , the transient phase of convergence towards this cycle takes a long time . in the green region where it is nonlinearly unstable",
    ", the neutral stability of the cycle produce some very strange transient behaviors where the activity of the cortical column is trapped around the neutrally stable wc system for long times , before leaving the neighborhood of this solution and converging towards the only stable solution which is the new cycle .",
    "[ [ sec : second2pop ] ] correlation - induced oscillations + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    correlations can have even more dramatic effects than modifying a periodic orbit as shown in model i , and in this section we describe a case where a periodic orbit arises for parameter values where wilson and cowan system only fixed - points .",
    "to this end , we choose a two - population network known to have bistability .",
    "this model consists of two - populations with inhibitory interactions and no self - interaction .",
    "the connectivity matrix in that case reads : @xmath191 the inactivation constants @xmath17 are assumed constant equal to @xmath143 , and the inputs to the two populations are distinct and denoted @xmath186 and @xmath190 ( hence the system is not fully symmetrical ) .",
    "the firing rate function are also identical and we make the usual choice @xmath192 for @xmath193 .",
    "these parameters define a model called model ii .",
    "we break the symmetries between the two populations by considering that each population can receive different input , we freeze the input @xmath190 and let @xmath186 vary . in that case , the standard wc system presents a bistable behavior between two stable fixed points as we illustrate in figure  [ fig : binoc2pops ] .",
    "the infinite size system driven by equations with these parameters has much richer dynamics , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : binoc2pops ] .",
    "we first set @xmath194 and study the bifurcation diagram as @xmath186 varies .",
    "we observe that the infinite - size system features a stable limit cycle , which is a qualitatively nontrivial effect of the correlations in the mean - field limit .",
    "all fixed - points behaviors in wc system are preserved , as predicted by theorem [ thm : wilsonbuicecowan ] ( black curves in figure  [ fig : binoc2pops](b ) ) , but new fixed points with non - zero correlations appear ( blue lines in the diagram ) .",
    "along one of the newly generated branch of fixed point , a supercritical hopf bifurcation appears , generating a family of stable limit cycles ( red circles in fig .  [ fig : binoc2pops](b ) ) that further undergoes few consecutive period doubling bifurcations .",
    "we note that the new branch of fixed points intersects the branch of fixed points of wilson and cowan system precisely at the saddle - node bifurcations of wilson and cowan system .",
    "this fact is compatible with a partial result of the proof of theorem [ thm : wilsonbuicecowan ] : at the saddle - node bifurcation , instead of a single eigenvalue equalling zero , two eigenvalues are simultaneously equal to zero , and the saddle - node bifurcations of wc system appear as transcritical bifurcations in the infinite size system .",
    "note that in that case , the wc behavior is nowhere the unique stable behavior of the system , and for any value of the input parameter @xmath186 , the infinite system will present attractive behaviors that are different from the wc behaviors .",
    "in particular , it has stable fixed points with non - zero correlations and non - zero correlation oscillations .",
    "however , we note that though these behaviors exist in the dynamics , the newly discovered fixed points do not constitute acceptable solutions since they are characterized by a negative firing - rate @xmath195 and a non - positive definite correlation matrix . however , the cycles constitute acceptable solutions that might have counterparts in the markov system .",
    "+    we further explore this model by choosing a large value of the input parameter to the second population , @xmath196 .",
    "for this level of input , the bifurcation diagram of wc system presents exactly the same features as in the case @xmath194 , namely two saddle - node bifurcations and a region of bistability of fixed points .",
    "the infinite - size system , similarly to the case @xmath194 , also has additional branches of fixed points with non - zero correlations that are connected to wc bifurcation diagram at the saddle - node bifurcation points .",
    "these saddle - nodes are degenerate and non - generic in the infinite size system from lemma [ lem : ckron ] and become transcritical bifurcations .",
    "these additional non - zero correlation fixed points can be stable or unstable , depending on the parameter , and add additional possible behaviors . from one of these branches ,",
    "the system undergoes a supercritical hopf bifurcation and a family of stable limit cycles appears .",
    "this branch of limit cycles undergoes two period - doubling bifurcations , torus bifurcations and two fold of limit cycles , yielding additional oscillatory behaviors to the purely fixed - point structure of wc system .    from all these observations on both models ,",
    "we conclude that the infinite - size system , besides featuring the same solutions as wilson and cowan system as a subset of solutions with zero correlations , also has additional behaviors that qualitatively differ from the wilson and cowan system .",
    "the mean - field limit including correlations is therefore a more complex system than wc system , in which correlations of the firing activity interact in a non - trivial way with the mean firing rate yielding complex behaviors .",
    "these qualitative correlation - induced behaviors can therefore be a good indicator of which model better accounts for the behavior of cortical columns and cortical areas if these behaviors hold in the finite - size systems which are equivalent to the moment equations of the initial markov chain .",
    "we now turn to investigating finite - size effects arising from the finiteness of the number of neurons in a network .",
    "the bifurcation diagram displayed by the infinite - size system studied in the previous section is composed of some very degenerate points , and displays behaviors the wc system does not display .",
    "the question that naturally arises at this point is to understand whether the infinite - size model or wc model really capture the qualitative behavior of large networks in the markovian framework through the bcc and bressloff finite - size equations .    in this section",
    "we first study how the infinite - size bifurcation diagram is unfolded in finite - size networks , before simulating the markov process and comparing its global behaviors to the behaviors of the finite - size systems .",
    "we observed that the finite - size bcc and bressloff equations appeared as a perturbation of the infinite - size system , in which the size of the network appears as a parameter of the equations . in all of this study , instead of considering discrete population sizes",
    ", we will consider the inverse of the total population size @xmath197 as a continuous parameter .",
    "non - trivial distinctions between finite - size networks and infinite size equation will essentially appear at the bifurcation points .",
    "indeed , since both the rescaled bressloff and bcc models vector fields are continuous with respect to the parameter @xmath23 , when the infinite - size system ( @xmath198 ) exhibits an hyperbolic fixed point , this fixed point will have a counterpart with the same stability for finite , sufficiently large networks , by application of the implicit functions theorem .",
    "this is also the case of hyperbolic fixed points of wc system , since these are hyperbolic fixed points of the infinite - size system with zero correlations . in order to study similarities and qualitative differences between finite - size networks and the infinite size limit",
    ", we will therefore focus on the bifurcations of both systems and numerically study the codimension two bifurcations in the one and two populations cases , with respect to the size of the network and to another parameter of interest ( for instance an input parameter ) .",
    "we start by investigating a single - population case . in the mean - field limit",
    ", we have shown that the infinite size system essentially exhibits the same behaviors as the wc model in terms of fixed points and limit cycles . but is this still the case where the number of neurons is finite ?    at the bifurcations of the wc system , singular phenomena can occur .",
    "consider for instance a saddle - node bifurcation point of wc system . at this point ,",
    "the infinite size system will present a double zero eigenvalue , and the unfolding of this bifurcation can lead to different cases . as we show in this section , it can either unfold into a generic saddle - node bifurcation as we show in the first section , or it can generate an oscillatory behavior through a limit cycle , creating in the finite - size system oscillations which do not exist in the wc or in the infinite size one population equations .",
    "we start by considering bcc model with a strictly positive voltage to rate function @xmath117 , and focus on acceptable solutions that have positive firing rates and correlations . in that case , we numerically show that there is no qualitative difference between the stable solutions of the finite - size bcc network on one hand , and the infinite size system and wc system on the other hand ( we showed that both models present the same qualitative behaviors in the one population case ) .",
    "we address this problem numerically , with an inactivation constant @xmath182 ( without loss of generality , since modifying this value only amounts rescaling time ) , @xmath199 , and letting both the size of the network @xmath23 and the input parameter @xmath200 free .",
    "the activity to rate function is chosen to be @xmath181 .    with these parameters ,",
    "wc system presents two saddle - node bifurcations when the input parameter @xmath200 varies , as shown in figure  [ sfig : wc1pop ] .",
    "the system therefore presents an interval of values of the parameter @xmath200 where the system presents two stable fixed points and an unstable fixed point , and outside this interval , the system has a unique fixed point which is stable .",
    "similarly to what we showed in the previous section , the infinite - size network presents exactly the same features , and no cycle .",
    "we now study bcc finite - size equations .",
    "we set the size of the network to be @xmath201 .",
    "bcc finite size equations present the same qualitative behaviors , and the same type of bifurcations : the system undergoes two saddle - node bifurcations as the input parameter value @xmath200 varies , and a bounded interval of input values @xmath200 where the system presents a bistable behavior .",
    "the only qualitative distinction between finite - size networks and infinite size networks is the existence of a two unstable fixed points in the bistable zone and the fact that the system presents two distinct branches of fixed points , but these differences only affect unstable fixed points and do not produce generic qualitative differences in the behaviors .",
    "the way this bifurcation diagram is transformed into the bifurcation diagram of the infinite system is very simple .",
    "the two distinct branches of fixed point get increasingly close , and in the limit @xmath198 , the two branches are superimposed . for finite - size networks ,",
    "we observe that the value of the correlations of the stable fixed points was non - zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1popcodim2bc ] ) .",
    "these values were nevertheless quite small , and decrease towards zero as the size of the network as the number of neurons increases . when continuing the two identified saddle - node bifurcations as the network size increases , we observe that the bifurcation curve persists until the limit @xmath198 with no singularity . at the limit",
    "however , the non - zero eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix at the saddle - node bifurcation point tangentially reaches the value @xmath188 yielding the singularity predicted in proposition [ prop : onepop ] .",
    "+   +    in this case , we therefore illustrated the fact that bcc system can smoothly unfold the wc system by introducing correlations .",
    "these correlations vanish as the size of the population increases , yielding a purely poisson firing with firing rates given by the solution of wc equations . for the same parameters and functions ,",
    "it is easy to show , following the same steps , that bressloff rescaled model also smoothly unfolds the wc system and that the finite - size system presents exactly the same type of bifurcations with two separated branches of fixed points each of which collapse in the limit where the number of neurons is infinite ( not shown ) , and the value of the correlations of the fixed points decreases towards zero when the number of neurons increases .",
    "however in this case , one has to bear on mind that the interpretation of the result slightly differs : the limit behavior is now seen as a purely asynchronous state where all the neurons of the population fire independently in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "these behaviors will closely match the markovian model s behavior as shown in section [ sec : onepop ] . in these cases",
    ", wc system conveniently summarizes the behavior of large networks , and provides a simple model to study large networks .",

    "now that we identified simple conditions for the hopf bifurcation to take place , we exhibit a network that indeed has this bifurcation .",
    "we choose for instance as activation function an hyperbolic tangent function @xmath225 with @xmath226 . in that case",
    ", we have : @xmath227 therefore this function satisfies the assumptions done in the previous paragraph .",
    "moreover , since @xmath228 and @xmath229 ( for @xmath1 small enough ) , the first lyapunov coefficient is negative , and therefore the system undergoes a supercitical hopf bifurcation and presents oscillations , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : oscillations1pop ] .",
    "therefore , we exhibited a case where the finite - size equations have important qualitative differences from the infinite - size equations . however this system involved non - physiological values of the parameters , in particular a non - positive activation function @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , this behavior will never appear in the markov process that yielded bcc equations .",
    "the question that then arises is whether such behaviors appear in plausible settings . in order to answer this question and search for a system with positive sigmoidal functions that indeed present oscillations in one - population networks , we continued the hopf bifurcation while continuously transforming the non - positive sigmoidal transform into a positive sigmoid .",
    "for instance , we consider @xmath117 a non - positive sigmoidal function for which the hopf bifurcation exhibited here appears , and define @xmath230 a transformation of @xmath117 such that @xmath231 and @xmath232 is a positive sigmoid .",
    "this homotopic transform smoothly maps the vector field presenting an attractive cycle onto a vector field with a positive activation function . since we have proved the genericity and transversality conditions on the hopf bifurcation identified , we are in position to continue it as the parameter @xmath233 varies together with @xmath220 in a codimension two bifurcation diagram ( by application of the inverse function theorem ) .",
    "we observe in that case that the hopf bifurcation can not be continued when varying the homotopy parameter until reaching a positive sigmoid ( see figure  [ fig : oscillations1pop](b ) for the example provided above ) .",
    "we have tried numerous other sets of parameters and have never been able to continue periodic orbits to a regime where there is a non - negative activation function .    therefore , though the one - population bcc equations can display oscillations for non biologically relevant parameters , we conjecture that there is no acceptable oscillatory solution for positive activation functions .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the one - population finite - size bcc model was accurately approximated by the infinite - size system ( and therefore the wc system from the result of a previous section ) for biologically realistic parameter , though oscillatory phenomena may occur for non - biologically relevant parameters that allow both the firing - rate and the correlations to be negative .",
    "the picture will be quite different in multi - population networks .",
    "indeed , in higher dimensions , the wc system can have hopf bifurcations that create very degenerate bifurcation points in the infinite - size system , which may non - trivially unfold in the finite - size systems . in this section , we consider the two population networks with excitatory self - interaction and negative feedback loop , called model i , introduced in section [ sec : negfeedback ] and address first the case of bressloff model , before showing that bcc model presents the same features in appendix [ appen:2popsbcfinite ] .",
    "this study will allow addressing in particular the question of the existence of so - called _ quasicycles _ and also of aperiodic solutions in the system close to the hopf bifurcation of the mean - field wilson and cowan limit , addressed recently in the same model by bressloff in  @xcite .",
    "these quasicycles correspond to intrinsic noise - induced oscillations in parameter regimes where the deterministic mean - field limit ( in that case wilson and cowan system ) is below the hopf bifurcation , and where the system features a stable focus .",
    "this phenomenon was also recently found in similar systems arising in biochemical oscillations of cellular systems , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "our approach to these phenomena consists in unfolding the hopf bifurcation of the mean - field system to finite network sizes , in order to understand how the intrinsic noise ( that can be seen as through the langevin approximation of the system valid for large population sizes as used in appendix  [ append : rodigtuck ] and in  @xcite ) interacts with the hopf bifurcation .    to fix ideas , we focus in this section on the particular network introduced in section [ sec : negfeedback ] , namely the two - population rescaled bressloff model . denoting @xmath234 , the equations read : @xmath235 - 2\\alpha_1 c_{11}+2\\,f'(s_{1})\\,(w_{11}\\,c_{11}+w_{12}\\,c_{12})\\\\          c_{22}'&=\\frac{1}{n_2 } [ \\alpha_2 \\nu_2 + f(s_2)]-2\\alpha_2 c_{22}+2\\,f'(s_{2})\\,(w_{21}\\,c_{12}+w_{22}\\,c_{22})\\\\          c_{12}'&=-(\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2 ) c_{12}+f'(s_{1})\\,(w_{11}\\,c_{12}+w_{12}\\,c_{22 } ) \\\\          & \\qquad + f'(s_2)\\,(w_{21}\\,c_{11}+w_{22}\\,c_{12})\\\\      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where we denoted : @xmath236    for the set of parameters studied in this section and a number of neurons @xmath201 , bressloff finite - size system undergoes four hopf bifurcations labelled h1 through h4 and six saddle node bifurcations lp1 through lp6 .",
    "it features two distinct families of limit cycles , one that undergoes two folds of limit cycles lpc1 and lpc2 , and one that undergoes a neimark - sacker ( torus ) bifurcation , as displayed in figure  [ fig : bressbifs02](b ) , and are compared with the standard wc system that displays one hopf bifurcation point h and two saddle node bifurcations lpa and lpb .",
    "the analysis of this bifurcation illustrates the fact that the small finite - size system studied have clear qualitative differences with the wc system .",

    "[ fig : bressbifs02 ] smoothly connects to the degenerate bifurcation diagram of the infinite - size system presented in section [ sec : negfeedback ] .",

    "the value of the correlation variables of these points progressively converge to zero as the network size increases .",
    "these two saddle - node bifurcations correspond in the infinite - size limit to the two saddle nodes of wc system lpa and lpb , and are not present in the finite - size model for a small number of neurons . the second codimension two bifurcation appearing in the diagram correspond to the disappearance of the hopf bifurcation point h4 through a bogdanov - takens bifurcation with the saddle - node bifurcation manifold corresponding to lp8 . except from these two codimension two bifurcations , the continuation of all other bifurcations is smooth for any @xmath239 .",

    "we observe that the fold of limit cycles merge with other bifurcations in the limit of infinitely many neurons ( see text ) . in the limit @xmath240 ( corresponding to @xmath198 ) we labelled the points h , lpa and lpb arising in wc system .",

    "this loss of stability corresponds to the continuation of the neimark - sacker bifurcation ns of figure  [ fig : bressbifs02 ] that can be continued in the mean - field limit .",
    "however , an important distinction between the finite and infinite case is that this cycle undergoes an additional period - doubling bifurcation when the size of the network increases , as observed in the bifurcation diagram of the infinite - size system , and as shown in figure [ fig : poincarechaos ] . in that figure , we continued these cycles for one fixed value of the parameter @xmath184 , as the number of neuron increases .",

    "eventually , the saddle - node bifurcation lp7 connects with the fold of limit cycle , generating the homoclinic bifurcation of the infinite - size system .",
    "we therefore observe that the bifurcation diagram of the finite - size bressloff model non - trivially unfolds the infinite - size system , and that at any finite scale the bifurcation diagram and the solutions it present differ significantly from the infinite - size system and from wc system .",
    "in particular , it shows additional cycles , as observed in the infinite - size system previously , and a chaotic effect that is not present in the two - dimensional wc system .",
    "this analysis also illustrates a mesoscopic - scale phenomenon in the presence of a periodic orbit that is stable only when the size of the network is comprised roughly between one hunded and one thousand neurons , a typical size of a cortical columns often modelled by wilson and cowan system .",
    "these results remain valid for bcc model , as shown in appendix [ appen:2popsbcfinite ] .",
    "the question that now arises is whether these behaviors indeed reflect behaviors of the markovian model .      in the previous section",
    ", we investigated the distinctions between the solutions of the finite - size bcc model and compared these with those of the infinite - size and of wc systems .",

    "a similar result is obtained in bcc case ( not shown ) .",

    "the same phenomenon appears close to lpa , in which case the diagram unfolds into a hopf bifurcation , a saddle node bifurcation , a fold of limit cycles and a saddle homoclinic bifurcation .",
    "we will observe that in both cases , the behavior of the markovian system actually reflects the properties of the finite - size moment equations , and that quasicycles will appear in the neighborhood of wc s hopf bifurcation .",

    "the curve of fold of limit cycles is no longer vertical in that case and a wide non - trivial region distinguishes the finite - size and wc s periodic orbit parameter regions .",

    "this might be linked with the stability of such orbits and the system size at which stable periodic orbit exist .",
    "this study therefore indicates that further exploration is needed to assess more clearly a definitive relationship between quasicycles and actual orbits of the moment equations , and there is a good chance that these two phenomena are related .",
    "this precise study is not within the scope of the present paper and we are currently actively working on this topic .",
    "of high interest also is the fact that in some regions corresponding to the vicinity of a hopf bifurcation , the moment equations present a low - dimensional chaotic behavior .",
    "such phenomena , of interest in neuroscience , have , to the best of our knowledge , not been shown , and we believe that if these phenomena indeed appear in the markovian system , this is of crucial interest in neuroscience and in the understanding of large - size stochastic systems .",
    "in this paper , we studied the different solutions of newly developed models for describing the mean - field limit of markovian neural networks modeling large - scale cortical areas : bcc and bressloff models@xcite .",
    "these equations were originally derived from a markovian implementation of the firing of each neurons in the population , whose transition probability satisfied a differential equation , the master equation of the process@xcite . both models studied drew on this framework but , since they addressed different neuronal regimes , dealt with different variables and different scaling , and after truncation of the moment hierarchy yielded sets two coupled equations , one governing the mean firing activity and the other governing the same - time correlations of the firing activity in the network ( or the ordered cumulant that can be deduced from the correlation and the mean firing rate ) .",
    "the particular aim of both models was to recover , in the limit where the number of neurons is infinite , the standard wc equations .",
    "we transformed these models in order to study the proportion of active neurons in each populations , in networks composed of different populations of neurons with different dynamics and composed of different number of neurons .",
    "both models include finite - size corrections , and the size of the network appears simply in the equations as a parameter of the model .",
    "the limit when the number of neurons tend to infinity appears in that view as a regular perturbation of the finite - size system in our particular choice of variables , and that both the bcc- and bressloff - derived models converged towards the same equations as the number of neurons tends to infinity , the infinite - size system .",
    "we analyzed the solutions of the infinite - size system , and established the fact that all solutions of wc system were associated with solutions of the infinite - size system with null correlations .",
    "however , we showed that the stability of the solutions obtained in that fashion did not necessarily have the same stability properties as in wc system : fixed points of the wilson and cowan system correspond to fixed points of the infinite - size system with zero correlations having the same stability , but all the cycles of the wc system are either unstable or neutrally stable in the infinite - size system .",
    "this destabilization of cycles gives rise to new behaviors ( fixed points or periodic orbits ) with non - zero correlations , the correlation - induced behaviors .",
    "when studying the finite - size equations and the way it relates to the properties of the infinite - size system , we presented evidence that the mean - field limit appears to be a singular limit , in the sense that for any finite - size of the network , the system presents behaviors the infinite - size system does not feature .",
    "moreover , singular points appear in the limit of infinitely many neurons , and for infinitely many neurons , branches of bifurcations collapse and disappear . besides these qualitative distinctions between finite and infinite - size systems , we numerically found mesoscopic - scale effects , namely behaviors that are only present at a certain population scale , and disappear for smaller or larger populations .",
    "the scale at which these behaviors took place coincided with the scale of typical cortical columns .",
    "such behaviors are neither captured by the study of small - networks nor by the mean - field limit , stressing the importance of precise descriptions of these intermediate scales in tractable approaches .",
    "we want to emphasize that the system - size expansion and the truncations are not valid at the bifurcation points . however , the bifurcation analysis we performed allowed us to uncover the number and stability of fixed points and limit cycles corresponding to different parameters .",
    "the actual transition of the stochastic process is a very complex phenomenon which would be worth studying but that present very important technical intricacies .",
    "we also note that the underlying markovian models are stochastic models .",
    "if the moment equations present multiple attractors , the stochastic system will randomly switch between the different attraction basins . a large - deviation study in the case where there is a small parameter ( bressloff case and bcc case in the fully connected system treated in the manuscript ) can allow one to identify the attractor switching and the mean exit time of each attraction basin in order to more precisely study the behavior of the underlying stochastic system , that could possibly be performed using freidlin and wentzell theory in the large @xmath1 case  @xcite . as already mentioned , paul bressloff opened the way to such studies by using wkb approximations allowing to compute the transition rates between metastable attractors in a one - population model  @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches could make use of the stochastic dynamical systems theory  @xcite .",
    "these approaches would allow directly studying the bifurcations of the initial stochastic system in the langevin approximation .",
    "correlation - induced and finite - size behaviors were then compared to the initial markovian model .",
    "we observed that when wc system presented an attractive fixed - point behavior , each sample path of the markov chain presented stochastic variations around these fixed points , the correlations tended towards zero and the mean coincided with wc fixed point . in that case , the network regime is therefore an asynchronous state , and is well approximated by wilson and cowan system .",
    "the validity of the moment equations close to bifurcations was shown in the derivations to be mainly valid far away from bifurcations .",
    "however , we showed that the codimension two bifurcations of the moment equations was closely matched with similar phenomena ( e.g. bistability ) observed in simulations of the markovian system .",
    "however , we also observed that both bcc and bressloff models can present additional behaviors in these regimes that are not present in the simulations of the markov chain .",
    "the moment expansion breaks down when considering periodic orbits of the wc system , corresponding to quasi - periodic stochastic solutions of the stochastic system , and different techniques such as the stochastic phase reduction , langevin approximation and floquet theory are very promising .",
    "however , we provided numerical evidences showing that actual cycles in the moment equations could be related to the phenomenon of quasicycles in the markovian system .",
    "these numerical observations strongly suggest further exploration along these lines .",
    "the precise study of all these points will further allow understanding the behavior of large scale systems , and will particularly be interesting in the study of rhythms in the brain , and possible synchronization or desynchronization as a function of the network size and of the connectivity .",
    "a particularly interesting point of the models studied in this paper is that they describe a stochastic process by a set of differential equations , where the size of the network appears as a perturbation parameter of a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this approach can be promising in order to study bifurcations of a stochastic processes and qualitatively analyzing its behaviors and the dependency of its solutions as a function of the parameters .",
    "we also noted that the behavior of each sample path of the process was possibly very different from the behavior of its first moments , which raises the question of the best variable to describe such stochastic processes .",
    "the mathematical method developed to study the stability of the correlation equations , involving kronecker products and sum and the application of floquet theory is of potential importance in the study of networks with correlations , since the form of the correlation equation is quite standard in this kind of problems ( see e.g. @xcite in the case of small noise expansion ) .",
    "this approach can also be applied to the study of the stability of solutions in networks involving hebbian learning , since the connectivity weights evolution depends on the firing correlations and the stability of the weights involves very similar equations as the ones we studied here .",
    "the need for extensions of the present study to more realistic markovian models involving more relevant biologically realistic transitions is a direct consequence of the present work .",
    "indeed , we have seen that the transitions chosen in the markovian model are only one - step jumps . in biological terms",
    ", this assumption means that when @xmath19 neurons are active in population at time @xmath7 , at least @xmath289 neurons are active at time @xmath290 , i.e. keep firing , which is not biologically realistic since after firing , a neuron immediately returns to quiescence .",
    "therefore extending the framework to a more complex state space of the markov chain would be of great interest for the development of these models towards more realistic biological grounds , and would probably allow a better assessment of the properties of cortical areas .    finally , in order to go beyond the description of the moments of the markov chain , we believe that one shall turn towards alternative ways to derive mean - field equations for such systems .",
    "a particularly interesting way to study such systems we are currently exploring builds upon recent methods developed for the study of markov chains , mainly in the field of queueing theory , such as fluid limits and large deviations approaches .",
    "the fluid limit technique is based on a space - time proper rescaling depending on the process under consideration , that yields deterministic or stochastic limits of the activity of the network when the number of neurons tends to infinity .",
    "large deviation techniques allow one to derive the finite - size corrections ( see e.g. @xcite in a case of stochastic ion channels ) and is a natural extension of our work .",
