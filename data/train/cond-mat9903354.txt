    "the spectral splitting of 3s core - level x - ray photoemission spectra ( xps ) in transition metals and their compounds originates from the exchange coupling between the 3s hole and the 3d electrons and was experimentally observed about three decades ago @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the 3s spectral splitting according to the van vleck theorem @xcite is determined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the total spin of the ground state of the 3d electrons , @xmath2 is the orbital quantum number ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4(3s,3d ) is the slater exchange integral . for 3d metal compounds ,",
    "the calculated 3s splitting is more than two times larger than the observed one .",
    "it indicates that the observed 3s splitting is not likely to be due to the spin exchange only .",
    "this fact was explained by the intra - shell correlation effects between 3s@xmath53p@xmath63d@xmath7 and 3s@xmath83p@xmath93d@xmath10 configurations @xcite .",
    "this scheme does not take into account the effect of a core - hole screening in the final state of photoemission .",
    "the final - state screening gives satellites in the x - ray photoelectron core - level spectra whereas `` main peaks '' usually correspond to final states with an extra 3d electron in comparison with the ground state .",
    "veal and paulikas @xcite proposed that the 3s splitting is determined by the exchange interaction in the 3s@xmath53d@xmath10 configuration rather than in the 3s@xmath53d@xmath7 configuration .",
    "kinsinger @xcite have shown that the model of veal and paulikas is correct for ni and cu compounds but fails for d - electron numbers of less than  6 .",
    "oh @xcite discussed the spectral shape of the 3s xps for fe and mn di - halides , taking into account the intra - atomic configuration interaction in a phenomenological manner .",
    "they proposed that the interpretation of 3s core - level spectra should be consistent with that of the 2p spectra . in this case , the 3s splitting reflects the local moment of the ground state only when the charge - transfer satellite in the 2p core - level spectra is negligible .",
    "okada and kotani @xcite theoretically investigated 2p and 3s core - level spectra in late 3d transition metal di - halides and monoxides in terms of a cluster model .",
    "it was found that the hybridization with high - order charge - transfer states can reduce the multiplet splitting of a spectrum .",
    "the calculations of the 3s spectra of crf@xmath11 , mnf@xmath11 fef@xmath11 and cr@xmath11o@xmath12 were carried out , and the importance of covalency in the final states of xps was noted @xcite .    in this paper , we present new experimental data on the 3s splitting in 3d monoxides , li - substituted oxides and cugeo@xmath12 .",
    "the values of the 3s exchange splitting for lamno@xmath12 , srmno@xmath12 , srfeo@xmath12 and cufeo@xmath11 are present too .",
    "we show that for the late 3d metal oxides ( cuo , cugeo@xmath12 , nio , coo , feo)the exchange splitting can be seen for both , the 3s@xmath53d@xmath10 and the 3s@xmath53d@xmath7 configuration . for earlier 3d metal monoxides and li - substituted oxides ,",
    "the value of the exchange splitting correlates well with that predicted for the 3s@xmath53d@xmath7 configuration .",
    "this effect is explained on the basis of a simple configuration - mixing model . for licoo@xmath11 with the 3d@xmath6 ground - state configuration ( @xmath13 ) no exchange splitting is fixed .",

    "the peaks @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the mno , lifeo@xmath11 , limno@xmath11 and licro@xmath11 spectra can be explained by the exchange splitting in the 3s@xmath53d@xmath7 final state configurations . for coo and nio , four peaks ar due to the exchange splitting of 3s@xmath53d@xmath7 and 3s@xmath53d@xmath10 final - state configurations with @xmath23 for nio and @xmath24 for coo .",
