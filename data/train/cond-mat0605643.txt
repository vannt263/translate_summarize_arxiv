    "the electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction leads in many low - dimensional materials like mx chains , conjugated polymers , or organic transfer complexes @xcite to structural distortions .",

    "many interesting questions arise not only with respect to the associated metal to insulator transition but also concerning the signatures of the single - particle excitations in the different phases .",
    "the interest in models of electrons interacting with phonons has been renewed by intriguing findings which implicate an important role of the ep coupling in a wide range of materials with strong electronic correlations ; high - temperature superconductors , manganites , or based compounds are well - known examples @xcite .    the one - dimensional holstein model of spinless fermions ( hm ) , @xmath0 is the simplest realization of a strongly coupled ep system and considers the local interaction @xmath1 between the electron density @xmath2 and dispersion - less phonons with frequency @xmath3 . the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 )",

    "the half - filled hm undergoes a quantum phase transition from a metallic state to a dimerized peierls phase . because the hm is not exactly solvable a number of analytical and numerical methods",
    "have been applied ( see references in @xcite ) to study the phase transition .",
    "in particular , the properties of the insulating phase have been shown to be sensitive to the relation between band - width and ep coupling @xcite : a band insulator is found in the adiabatic case @xmath9 whereas a polaronic superlattice occurs in the anti - adiabatic limit @xmath10 .",
    "recently , we applied the projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) @xcite to the hm at half - filling where both the metallic and the insulating case has been studied @xcite . here , we extend our work @xcite to discuss the phonon as well as the electronic one - particle excitation spectrum in more detail .",
    "most of the work is restricted to the adiabatic limit @xmath9 where a phonon softening is found if the ep coupling approaches the critical value @xmath11 of the transition . in contrast , a phonon stiffening occurs for @xmath12 .",
    "the most remarkable findings of our present work are the large contributions to the phonon spectrum which are caused by the coupling to electronic particle - hole excitations .",
    "note that presently in the anti - adiabatic limit the insulating phase can not be studied because no stable solutions are found for @xmath13 .",
    "we use the recently derived uniform description of metallic and insulating phases of the half - filled hm @xcite .",
    "this approach employs the prm @xcite where an effective hamiltonian @xmath14 is obtained by a sequence of unitary transformations , @xmath15 , by which transitions between eigenstates of the unperturbed part @xmath16 of the hamiltonian are eliminated in steps .",
    "the respective transition energies are used as renormalization parameter @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 has to be adjusted so that @xmath19 only contains excitations with energies smaller or equal @xmath20 . in this way ,",
    "an effectively free model , @xmath21 was found in ref .",

    "( [ g2 ] ) a reduced brillouin zone has been introduced in order to allow a dimerization of the system , and both the fermionic and bosonic one - particle operators as well as the model parameters have additional band indices , @xmath24 . in eq .",

    "thus , @xmath31 , @xmath26 , and @xmath29 can easily be computed if the phononic and electronic one - particle operators are transformed in the same way as the hamiltonian ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "for instance , by taking the fully transformed phonon operator @xmath32 we obtain for the phonon spectral function in the metallic region @xmath33 where terms with two bosonic creation or annihilation operators have been neglected .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 can be determined within the prm approach .",

    "in the following we discuss the results for the one - phonon and one - electron spectral functions , @xmath31 , @xmath26 , and @xmath29 .",
    "we start with the adiabatic limit ( @xmath39 ) where the metallic as well as the insulating phase can be described within the prm approach . in panel",
    "( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , @xmath26 and @xmath29 are shown for different values of the wave vector @xmath27 as functions of @xmath40 .",
    "the used parameters , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , belong to the metallic region in the adiabatic limit so that no gap occurs at the fermi level at @xmath43 .",
    "both functions are dominated by the coherent electronic excitation at @xmath44 @xcite",

    "[ fig_1 ] , the frequency behavior of the phonon spectral function @xmath31 is also dominated by the coherent excitation at @xmath46 @xcite in this parameter regime . if the ep coupling @xmath1 is close to the critical value @xmath11 of the metal - insulator transition , a strong softening of the coherent excitation at @xmath46 can be observed in the adiabatic limit for @xmath47 values approaching the brillouin zone boundary at @xmath48 .",
    "this phonon softening is caused by the coupling to electrons and has already been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . it will turn out that a phonon hardening occurs in the anti - adiabatic limit .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] shows that the energies of the incoherent excitations are distributed over an energy range of the order of the electronic bandwidth .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ g5 ] ) , the energy spreading is caused by the energy differences of electronic particle - hole excitations @xmath49 where @xmath27 runs over the whole brillouin zone . from the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ g5 ] ) , @xmath50 $ ] , one concludes that either @xmath44 is smaller and @xmath51 larger than the fermi energy or vice versa . in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , eq .",
    "( [ g5 ] ) also shows that the energy range of the incoherent excitations increases with increasing @xmath47 . due to the absence of an electronic gap in the metallic phase , incoherent excitations with small energies",
    "are present for @xmath47-values close to @xmath52 and @xmath48 .",
    "next , let us consider the ordered insulating phase in the adiabatic limit , @xmath9 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 have been chosen .",
    "the gap of order @xmath55 in the electronic excitation spectrum [ compare panel [ a ] of fig .",

    "again the electronic spectral functions @xmath26 and @xmath29 are dominated by the coherent excitation at @xmath44 , and the spreading of the incoherent excitations is similar to that of the metallic state [ compare with panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ] . as one can see in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , the spectral weight of the coherent excitation is for the phonon spectral function @xmath31 again huge in comparison to that of the incoherent excitations .",
    "however , it is important to notice a significant difference to the metallic state [ compare panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ] : no incoherent excitations occur at low energies which corresponds to the gap in the electronic spectrum .",
    "next we discuss the anti - adiabatic limit where @xmath10 holds . unfortunately , in this limit we are restricted to the metallic case @xmath56 , because no stable solution for the insulating phase @xmath57 is found within the prm approach .",
    "the reason is that the absolute value of the ep coupling @xmath1 is too large in this case .",
    "as one can see in ref .",
    "@xcite , the renormalization equations were derived by starting from an uncorrelated model by successively eliminating high - energy excitations which prevents the application of the prm scheme for extremely high coupling parameters @xmath1 .",
    "the electronic spectral functions @xmath26 and @xmath29 are shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] for the metallic phase , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 have been chosen .",
    "the missing gap in the electronic spectrum reveals the metallic state of the system , and the @xmath27 dependence of the sharp coherent excitation peak corresponds to the dispersion @xmath44 of the electrons .",
    "the coherent excitation is separated from the incoherent excitations by an energy of the order of the phonon energy @xmath60 . here , a renormalized one - electron creation operator @xmath61 has been used which includes phonon operators only in linear order ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "this coupling leads to the energetic separation of order @xmath60 . if operator terms with more than a single phonon operator were taken into account additional excitations at higher frequencies ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , etc . )",
    "would appear .",
    "this is confirmed by recent ed results of @xcite .",
    "the metal - insulator transition in the anti - adiabatic limit can be understood as the formation of small immobile polarons which are electrons surrounded by clouds of phonon excitations . in the prm approach polarons",
    "correspond with the fully renormalized electronic excitations @xmath44 . if one compares the renormalized electronic band width for the adiabatic case , which can be read off from the coherent excitation in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , with that of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] in the anti - adiabatic case one observes a strong reduction of the band width .",
    "this reduction clearly indicates localization tendencies in the system which might allow the determination of the critical ep coupling @xmath11 of the metal - insulator transition in the anti - adiabatic limit within our prm approach @xcite .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] shows the phononic spectral function @xmath31 in the anti - adiabatic limit .",
    "it is important to notice three significant differences to the adiabatic case [ compare with panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ] : firstly , the coherent phonon excitation no longer shows a softening behavior , instead an hardening of the phonon modes is observed from a value @xmath60 at @xmath52 to higher energies for all @xmath64 .",
    "secondly , the incoherent contributions from particle - hole excitations have gained considerable weight as compared to the adiabatic case [ see panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ] . the energy range of the incoherent excitations is again of the order of the electronic band width .",
    "finally , a huge elastic contribution is found in @xmath31 for @xmath48 .",
    "phononic and electronic spectral functions for the one - dimensional hm at half - filling were recently evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "the same parameter values as used here were studied by exact diagonalization techniques ( ed ) for system sizes of up to @xmath65 lattice sites .",
    "the results for the electronic spectral functions @xmath26 and @xmath29 agree quite well with our analytical results in the whole metallic regime . in the phonon spectrum two essential differences are found . in the ed - approach @xcite a strong excitation is found at frequency @xmath43 for wave vector @xmath52 both in the adiabatic and in the anti - adiabatic case .",
    "in contrast , the results in figs . [ fig_1 ] and",
    "[ fig_3 ] show excitations for small @xmath47 only for finite frequencies @xmath66 .",
    "this additional zero - frequency peak in ref .",
    "@xcite is caused by a different definition of the phonon spectral function . instead of the commutator spectral function @xmath31 , in @xcite a phononic correlation function , @xmath67 ,",
    "is investigated so that an additional zero - frequency contribution from the center of gravity motion contributes , which is dropped in the commutator spectral function as defined in eq .",
    "( [ g3 ] ) .    the second difference between our results and those of the ed approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is more important : in the phonon spectrum of @xcite almost no small frequency excitations are found in the vicinity of @xmath48 whereas the present prm approach for @xmath68 in the anti - adiabatic limit gives a strong zero - energy peak at @xmath48 . for a more detailed discussion",
    "let us consider the phonon spectrum for different @xmath47-values in the vicinity of @xmath48 [ panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ] .",
    "as follows from ( [ g5 ] ) , the incoherent excitations in @xmath31 are caused by the coupling of the phonons to electronic particle - hole excitations with energies @xmath69 where the wave vector @xmath27 runs over the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the energies @xmath51 and @xmath44 have to be below and above the fermi level with momentum @xmath70 .",
    "thus , only electronic particle - hole excitations contribute with either @xmath71 and @xmath72 , or @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for @xmath48",
    "this condition is fulfilled for all @xmath27-values of the brillouin zone , and incoherent excitations are found in an energy regime of the order of the electronic band width . for @xmath48",
    "the smallest possible energy difference @xmath69 is the same as the energy difference of two neighboring @xmath27 points around @xmath75 with the smallest possible distance in @xmath27-space .",
    "this distance is of order @xmath76 and might be not small for a small system size .",
    "this explains the absence of low - energy excitations in the phonon spectrum of ref .",
    "@xcite close to the brillouin - zone boundary ( where only system sizes of order n=10 have been considered ) .",
    "we could confirm this mechanism within our prm approach : if we reduce the system size from 500 to 66 lattice sites the low - frequency peak in @xmath68 is almost completely suppressed , and its position is shifted to higher energies .",
    "let us also discuss the case of small @xmath47-values @xmath77 , where only @xmath27 values from the sum in ( [ g5 ] ) can contribute which are located in a small wave vector region around the fermi momentum @xmath70 . assuming a linear momentum dependence for energies close to fermi energy , the incoherent electronic excitation energies can be replaced by @xmath78 .",
    "( @xmath79 is the fermi velocity . ) for small @xmath47 the position of the incoherent excitations is proportional to @xmath47 , as seen in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] . on the same time",
    "the intensity of the incoherent peak is approximately @xmath47 independent which follows again from ( [ g5 ] ) : the linear @xmath47 dependence of the denominator is canceled by the number of contributing @xmath27 points which is also proportional to @xmath47 so that an approximately @xmath47 independent intensity results .",
    "finally , we use the prm to evaluate the luttinger liquid parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 in the metallic phase at half - filling .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the spinless one - dimensional hm belongs to the tomonaga - luttinger universality class , and at @xmath82 a luttinger liquid should be realized .",
    "due to the quite different behavior of the phonon spectral function in the adiabatic and in the anti - adiabatic regime one expects different results in both cases . for the velocity @xmath80 of the charge excitations ,",
    "we use a finite - size scaling of the energy gap  @xcite , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the lattice size , and @xmath85 denotes the ground - state energy of the half - filled system .",
