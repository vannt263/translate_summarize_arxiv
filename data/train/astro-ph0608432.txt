    "supernovae have been classified mainly based on their spectrum near maximum , the events which show the presence of hydrogen lines have been termed as supernovae type ii ( sne ii ) and those which do not show hydrogen are classified as type i. type ii events are thought to arise from the gravitational collapse of stars more massive than @xmath6 .",
    "sne ii have been further divided based on their light curve @xcite as type ii - l ( linear ) and type ii - p ( plateau ) .",
    "supernovae type iip ( sne iip ) are characterized by a plateau of nearly constant luminosity in their light curve , originating because of propagation of a cooling and recombination wave through the supernova envelope .",
    "@xcite has shown that sne iip form a sequence from low - luminosity , low - velocity , nickel - poor events to bright , high velocity , nickel - rich objects .",
    "further , there is an indication that more massive progenitors produce more energetic explosion and supernovae with greater energies produce more nickel .",
    "the direct identification of the progenitor of a few sne iip indicates these events arise from stars with masses in the range @xmath7 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "sn 2004et was discovered by moretti on sept .",
    "27 , 2004 in the nearby starburst galaxy ngc 6946 , which has already produced seven supernovae during 1917 to 2003 .",
    "based on a high resolution spectrum that showed a relatively featureless spectrum with a very broad , low contrast h@xmath0 emission , @xcite classified the supernova as a type ii event , which was later confirmed by a low resolution spectrum taken on 2004 oct 01 by @xcite .",
    "the p - cygni profile of h@xmath0 was greatly dominated by the emission component , while the other hydrogen balmer lines had a more typical p - cygni profile .",
    "the continuum was quite blue , although there was very low flux shortward of 4000 .",
    "the supernova was detected in the radio frequencies at 22.460 ghz and 8.460 ghz on 2004 oct 5.128 @xcite , suggesting the presence of appreciable circumstellar material around sn 2004et .",
    "based on pre - explosion images of ngc 6946 , @xcite identified the candidate progenitor as a yellow supergiant with an estimated zero age main sequence mass of @xmath8 .",
    "the identification of the progenitor was confirmed with post - outburst hubble space telescope images obtained on 2005 may 02 @xcite .",
    "this makes sn 2004et one of the few core - collapse supernovae with a directly identified progenitor .",
    "the proximity and brightness of sn 2004et made it an ideal target for an intensive monitoring .",
    "we present in this paper the results based on extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2004et during @xmath9 8 - 541 days since explosion .",
    "sn 2004et was observed with the 2 m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) of the indian astronomical observatory ( iao ) , hanle , india , using the himalaya faint object spectrograph camera ( hfosc ) , equipped with a @xmath10 pixel ccd .",
    "the central @xmath11 region of the ccd used for imaging covers a field of view of 10x10 arcmin , with a scale of 0.296 arcsec pixel@xmath12 .",
    "the photometric monitoring of sn 2004et , in bessell @xmath13 filters @xcite , began on 2004",
    "september 29 , soon after its discovery , and continued until 2006 march 16 .    the data were bias subtracted , flat - field corrected and cosmic rays removed adopting the standard manner , using the various tasks available under the iraf software .",
    "data obtained on photometric nights were calibrated using standard fields @xcite and a sequence of local standards in the supernova field ( ref .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) were used for photometric calibration of the supernova .",
    "table [ tab1 ] gives the @xmath14 magnitudes of the secondary standards averaged over a few photometric nights .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the local standards using an aperture of radius determined based on an aperture growth curve .",
    "the magnitudes of the supernova and also the local standards were estimated using the profile - fitting method , using a fitting radius corresponding to the full width at half maximum of the stellar profile .",
    "the difference between aperture and profile - fitting magnitudes was obtained using the standards and this correction was applied to the supernova magnitude .",
    "the supernova magnitudes were calibrated differentially with respect to the local standards listed in table [ tab1 ] , the final magnitude of the supernova was derived by taking an average of these estimates .",
    "the estimated supernova magnitudes and errors are listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the errors in the magnitudes were estimated by combining the fit errors in quardature with those introduced by the transformation of instrumental magnitudes into the standard system .
