    "the large range in the age of the clusters allows to observe star clusters at various epochs in their evolution and make it possible to identify evolutionary trends .    in spite of the advent of new generation ground and space based telescopes , the integrated parameters of star clusters are the only observable parameters to investigate the evolutionary history of stellar systems beyond the local group of galaxies . in order to interpret the integrated parameters of extra - galactic star clusters ,",
    "it is necessary to study the integrated parameters of star clusters of our galaxy where observation of individual stars in the cluster region can be carried out to study the various parameters like age , mass , metallicity , etc . with sufficient accuracy ( e.g. hancock et al .",
