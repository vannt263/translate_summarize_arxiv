    "no mean flow in the simulation box is imposed in the initial condition .    to initiate magnetic reconnection we locally impose small - amplitude random perturbations on the plasma pressure in the proximity of the scs2 location in the simulation box .",
    "a locally increased level of noise is supposed to accelerate the growth of the tearing instability and the development of the reconnection sites .",
    "the simulation starting from the initial condition described above results in a time evolution , where the development of the reconnection sites at random locations on scs2 initiates the growth of magnetic islands at the current sheet ( see , e.g. @xcite for a more detailed discussion of a qualitatively similar scenario ) . merging interacting magnetic islands",

    "note that the profiles presented in figure [ profiles_sim_data ] result from the motion of the virtual spacecraft in a spatially inhomogeneous environment accompanied by temporal changes of the spatial distribution of the magnetic field vector . as illustrated in figure [ profiles_sim_data ]",
    "the simulation properly reproduces the following features of the _ v1 _ measurements : the magnetic field enhancement of a factor 1.4 between the v1cs1 and v1cs2 crossings ( marked by mc1 ) , and strong pulsations of the magnetic field strength after the v1cs2 crossing ( marked by mc2 ) .",
    "the v1cs1 crossing is associated with @xmath16 angle pulsations in the negative range of values , whereas mostly positive values of @xmath16 were measured for the v1cs2 crossing .",

    "the @xmath01.4 fold increase of the magnetic field strength ( mc1 in figure [ profiles_sim_data ] ) between v1cs1 and v1cs2 is apparently related to a magnetic compression occurring when two magnetic islands from neighboring current sheets collide with each other , as illustrated in figure [ f4](a ) .     and ( b ) @xmath52 .",

    "the aspect ratio of the plot has been altered to better visualize details.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    this is a rather typical feature in this physical configuration as resulting from independent motion of magnetic islands at neighboring current sheets during the early stage of development of the islands . when the islands at two current sheets have grown to a size comparable to the distance between the sheets , they start to interact causing significant magnetic compressions .",
    "even stronger magnetic compressions are seen after the v1cs2 crossing , marked by mc2 in figure [ profiles_sim_data ] . as shown in figure [ f4](b ) these magnetic strength enhancements",
    "are associated with the internal structure of the magnetic islands , appearing during the merging process of two islands significantly different in size .",
    "it is again a rather typical situation that reconnection sites initiated at random locations on a current sheet produce magnetic islands that have generally different sizes .",
    "therefore the merging process is likely to include magnetic islands of different sizes .    due to the purely mhd nature of our simulations the cosmic ray component",
    "is not included in our computations .",
    "therefore accurate tracking of high - energy particle fluxes is not possible .",
    "heuristically we may argue that since the magnetic compression mc2 in the simulation is part of a magnetic island that has grown at scs2 discontinuity , it is likely to contain higher energy particles from the lism and a deficit of cosmic rays of heliospheric origin .",
    "however , a detailed description of cosmic ray fluxes is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "another novel feature revealed by our simulation is advective transport of the relatively dense lism plasma into the heliosphere through the reconnecting hp . due to the magnetic strength and density jump across the current sheet scs2 we obtain a bulge of magnetic separatrices and reconnection jets toward the ihs ( small values of @xmath4 ) , which is a typical feature of asymmetric reconnection ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . during the development of the reconnection sites in random locations on the current sheet , reconnection jets from different reconnection sites",
    "interact causing local density and pressure enhancements .",
    "the plasma flow velocity component is @xmath56 on average in these compressions , and thus plasma is transported away from the hp toward the ihs ( see figure [ f5](a ) , @xmath35 ) , which is the lower density region . at a later moment in time",
    ", the transport of plasma across the scs2 occurs in several ducts ( see figure [ f5](b ) ) spontaneously appearing on the current sheet as a result of merging of smaller structures . when magnetic islands from the two current    , ( b ) @xmath57 , and ( c ) @xmath58",

    "the aspect ratio of the plot has been altered to better visualize details.,title=\"fig:\",width=328 ]    sheets in the simulation start to interact , plasma from the density intrusions is transported effectively deep into the ihs .",
    "later , the magnetic sector initially set up between the scs1 and scs2 is annihilated and the reconnection process and transport of the dense plasma across the scs2 ceases . as illustrated in figure [ f5](c ) , in the final state we observe dense plasma intrusions separated from the scs2 and layered in the ihs region .",
    "our results indicate that the ihs penetration depth for the intrusions is @xmath59 au , but the simulation does not include the ihs turbulence that could presumably transport the density intrusions even deeper into the ihs .",
    "the average flux inside the transport ducts estimated from our computations is @xmath60 @xmath61 s@xmath26 , the typical linear size of the transport ducts is @xmath00.5 au , the separation distance between the ducts is @xmath07 au , and the transport event duration time is @xmath01.5 yr .",
    "we present results of the modeling of the plasma dynamics in the proximity of the hp that shed light on its internal structure and the surrounding region .",
    "the model is validated by finding virtual spacecraft observations corresponding to the magnetic field vector measurements obtained during _",
    "v1 _ crossing through the acr boundary .",
    "this allows us to provide an interpretation of particular segments of the observations in terms of the fine - scale physical effects responsible for their appearance .",
    "results of our simulations suggest that characteristic features of the _ v1 _ spacecraft measurements can be explained as resulting from dynamical processes driven by magnetic reconnection occurring at two closely separated current sheets , the hcs and the hp .",
    "our simulation also reveals a transport mechanism of the relatively dense lism plasma through the hp to the ihs region , that may be responsible for the formation of density intrusions in the ihs filled by dense plasma of interstellar origin .",
    "the values of the basic parameters characterizing the transport process are reported in section [ sec : transport ] of our letter .",
    "the advective transport of plasma has been obtained within an mhd approach that describes the dynamics of the thermal plasma component .",
    "the plasma experiment for _",
    "v1 _ has not been in operation since 1981 , and thus plasma density measurements are not available for 2012 .",
    "the density estimates deduced by @xcite from the plasma wave instrument were obtained for much later times than the final jump in the magnetic field strength ( seen on day 237 of 2012 ) .",
    "the region of the density intrusions is predicted by our computations to appear ahead of the jump , thus the measurements by @xcite do not allow for observational confirmation of the transport process .",
    "mechanisms of transport of high - speed cosmic rays are generally different from the advective transport of thermal plasma described by the mhd approximation . therefore , it is not clear at present how the density intrusions revealed by our simulations may be related to abrupt jumps of acr or gcr fluxes observed by _ v1 _ ( days 210237 of 2012 ) .",
    "possible hp crossing by _",
    "v2 _ in the future could provide interesting data in this respect .",
    "our results are interesting in the context of the so - called pile - up problem for the hcs .",
    "the hcs foldings are constantly produced by the changing magnetic polarity of the sun and advected by the sw to the ihs region @xcite .",
    "the recent _ v1 _ observations indicate that at least some of the hcs foldings and the magnetic sectors between them may survive the advective transport in turbulent sw and appear very close to the hp .",
    "this suggests that the annihilation of magnetic sectors in the direct heliospheric neighborhood of the hp could be a quite likely solution to the pile - up problem for the hcs .",
    "for this reason one may expect that the scenario of appearance of density intrusions in the ihs shown in our simulations repeats periodically in nature .",
    "since the increase of the average density in the ihs may change the pressure balance between the ihs and ohs , the effects discussed in our letter may have consequences for the global structure of the heliosphere .",
    "the density profile in the neighborhood of the hp is an interesting question in this context as well .",
    "we believe that the transport mechanism revealed by our simulations is important for a proper understanding of the interaction of the sw and interstellar plasmas ."
