    "observation at poisson epochs is both of theoretical and practical interest .",

    "the poisson observation structure is a bridge between continuous - time and discrete - time observation that still leads to rather explicit , and as will be shown below , also somewhat elegant modifications of the continuous - time formulas .      in order to stress the intuition behind the derivation of the identities , we will start with a simple case and",
    "gradually generalize the setup .",
    "most of the results are stated in terms of relations between transforms , but can also be understood as relations between the corresponding laws in an obvious way .",
    "+ some of the wording throughout the manuscript will be in terms of the insurance application , where @xmath4 is the surplus process of a portfolio of insurance contracts , @xmath14 is the time of ruin of the portfolio , @xmath19 is the event of ( infinite - time ) survival , and @xmath13 is the time of observed ruin under poisson observation of the surplus process ( in the application the poisson epochs can for instance be interpreted as the observation times of the regulatory authority ) . + in section  [ sec : exit1 ] we discuss survival probabilities corresponding to the two observation types , and then proceed to the general one - sided exit problems including the time of exit and the overshoot . in section  [ sec : exit2 ]",
    "we consider more complex problems .",
    "firstly , the two - sided exit problem with one continously observed and one discretely observed boundary is related to the one where the observation types at the boundaries are interchanged .",
    "secondly , we provide a link between poisson exit of a reflected process and continuous exit of the process reflected at poisson epochs .",
    "we also show that a two - sided problem with poisson exit at both boundaries yields an identity as well , but with a non - standard first passage time . the latter quantity is then linked to a parisian ruin problem with erlang - distributed implementation delay .",
    "finally , we establish a link between parisian ruin problems with continuous and poisson observations .",
    "we conclude with section  [ sec : spectral1 ] , where we specialize to the case of spectrally - one sided processes and demonstrate the use of our simple identities , providing simpler proofs and additional insight to some identities established in earlier literature .",

    "let us first consider @xmath30 which in the insurance application are the probabilities of survival with initial capital @xmath5 under continuous and poisson observation , respectively .",
    "in fact , the two quantities are connected by two very simple relations :    [ prop : survival ] for @xmath31 it holds that @xmath32        survival under poisson observation is determined by the sequence @xmath33 , whereas survival under continuous observation is determined by the sequence of infima in between the observation epochs ( black and grey dots in figure  [ fig : wh_points ] , respectively ) .",
    "let @xmath34 and define @xmath35 @xmath36 in the same way but for the shifted process @xmath37 and exponential time @xmath38 .",

    "observe that all @xmath44 and @xmath45 are independent , because of independence of increments and the wiener - hopf factorization .",
    "since the @xmath45 s have the law of @xmath27 we obtain @xmath46 similarly , @xmath47 hence @xmath48 and , since @xmath31 , @xmath49    relation allows to interpret the transition from continuous to discrete poisson observation simply as a ( random ) increase of the starting value ( initial capital ) @xmath5 by @xmath28 , as far as the survival probability is concerned ; that is the structure of @xmath50 as a function of @xmath5 is otherwise completely preserved .",
    "likewise , relation shows that moving from discrete poisson to continuous observation preserves the structure , reducing the initial capital by @xmath27 ( which has all its probability mass on the negative half - line ) .",

    "one can connect the finite - time survival probabilities @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 : @xmath55 that is , survival under continuous observation up to an independent erlang distributed time horizon is intimately related to survival under poisson observation up to a certain arrival epoch .

    "so the patterns of points in each case have the same law up to a certain shifting ; we illustrate this by using the same patterns of points in both pictures in figure  [ fig : exit2 ] and by drawing different sample paths .",

    "such a refraction has the interpretation of taxation according to a loss - carry - forward scheme and tax rate @xmath91 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the two - sided exit with poisson observation at both barriers can be related to a model with another type of exit time .",

    "similarly , we also have the reverse identities : @xmath99      parisian ruin is defined as the first time when an excursion of @xmath4 below 0 is longer than some time @xmath100 ( sometimes referred to as _ implementation delay _ ) .",
    "whereas the classical definition is in terms of a deterministic @xmath101 , for analytic tractability it is often assumed that @xmath101 is a random variable , and that an independent copy of @xmath101 is assigned to each excursion , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "firstly , from the memoryless property it follows that the time @xmath13 of poisson ruin is also the time of parisian ruin in the case where @xmath101 is an exponential random variable with rate  @xmath102 . secondly , @xmath103 as defined in section [ 3.3 ] is the time of parisian ruin in the case where @xmath101 is erlang@xmath104 distributed ( since the latter is the sum of two independent exponential variables ) .",
    "similarly to  , equation [ eq : parisian1 ] can easily be extended to @xmath105{{\\mathbb e}}e^{-{\\alpha}t^d+{\\beta}d},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which under the present interpretation relates parisian ruin quantities with exponential and erlang(2)-distributed implementation delay ( here we took @xmath106 for simplicity ) . more generally ,",

    "so in particular @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . on the other hand ,",
    "define @xmath112 as the first epoch @xmath113 such that @xmath114 , i.e. the process has been observed negative at the last @xmath115 poisson epochs . then , along the same line of arguments , we can extend ( cf .",
