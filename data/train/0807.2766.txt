    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , we diagonalize the flavor eigenstates to the mass eigenstates @xmath11 with obvious notations .",
    "is the ( 11)-component of @xmath12 and @xmath13 is ( 11)-component of the matrix @xmath14 , etc . ] in sm , we _ define _ the electron as the lightest charged lepton , thus its flavor and mass eigenstates are identical . at the same time we independently define the up quark as the lightest quark , because it is not connected to leptons by any interactions .",
    "one may have equal right to define the muon as the lightest lepton , in sm this is just renaming . however in gut , the quarks and leptons are related , for instance @xmath15 is related to @xmath16 in @xmath17 of @xmath7 . once we define the electron by fixing @xmath15 and @xmath18 in the entire multiplets @xmath19 , the up - type quarks follow from the relative mass eigenstates @xmath20 by @xmath21 to form the flavor multiplet . therefore defining the muon as the lightest lepton modifies the identity of the up quark as the lightest , since the new definition is now distinguished .",
    "thus in general , even the flavor eigenstates of up - type quarks are not guaranteed to be mass eigenstates .",
    "also it means that we can distinguish contorted flavors , as in ( [ twistgen ] ) and ( [ twistlr ] ) . on the other hand , this information is not relevant in the low energy physics , since there is no interaction connecting like ( [ eu ] ) in sm .",
    "even if a low level theory predicts the lighter mass for the muon than the electron belonging to @xmath22 , misidentification of the lightest as electron _ does not _ change sm .",
    "after fixing the electron , the relative fermions in @xmath7 are completely connected by the relative basis change matrices ( rbcms ) , among them are ckm matrix @xmath23 @xcite and pmns matrix @xmath24 @xcite , up to renormalization effects .",
    "for example , the emission of @xmath25 boson from down quark to _",
    "quark accompanies the rbcm @xmath26 , which is to be distinguished from the ckm element @xmath27 . in the minimal @xmath7",
    ", we have two yukawa couplings @xmath28 and @xmath29 diagonalized by four matrices @xmath30 .",
    "we can fix @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a diagonal @xmath34 matrix .",
    "thus , besides known quark and lepton masses and ckm matrix , we have two new phases @xcite .",
    "since @xmath35 gut completely relates all the fields in sm , we can in principle completely observe the yukawa coupling itself , from interactions in gut .",
    "this means , it is not possible to arbitrarily align the flavor and the mass eigenstates .",
    "in the minimal @xmath7 , the rbcm between down - type quarks and conjugate leptons is @xmath36 , without loss of generality .",
    "it means that , for example by charged @xmath37 boson exchange , @xmath38 always transits to @xmath18 , @xmath39 , but there is no transition between @xmath38 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "it is because there is no difference in mass diagonalization between down - type quarks and leptons @xmath42 .",
    "however the minimal models lead to bad mass relations @xmath43 , which is renormalization group invariant .",
    "one should introduce more higgs fields and as many complex yukawa matrices .",
    "usual fermion textures in non - minimal gut imply similar rbcms between quarks and leptons , with slightly modified diagonality , but in general there emerges many new phases .    to correct the relations , the main paradigm after ref .",
    "@xcite has been to introduce 45 and and higher dimensional higgses . for illustration",
    ", we adopt the most general renormalizable yukawa coupling including @xmath44 : @xmath45 where the coefficients are in general complex matrices in the flavor basis . with some assumptions on the form of yukawa couplings and vev",
    ", we can have the following form of mass matrices for isospin @xmath46 fermions @xmath47 which is also a typical texture from ` minimal renormalizable ' @xmath35 , making use of @xmath48 and @xmath49 higgses @xcite . the elements in the same letters come from the same vevs of @xmath50 and @xmath44 , with some clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "if we take @xmath51 , in the parameter range @xmath52 after diagonalization @xcite .",
    "however in the parameter range @xmath53 as before , we have _ inverted lepton mass hierarchy _ with respect to quarks .",
    "@xmath54 however we note that , although lepton mass hierarchy is inverted , still _ we identify the electron as the lightest _ charged lepton in sm",
    ". therefore it will be more appropriate to collect the multiplet as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "if the parameters are aligned to fit the observed fermion masses @xmath57 mev@xmath58 , @xmath59 mev@xmath58 ( neglecting renormalization corrections ) , we can not see the change in sm .",
    "of course , this has distinguished consequences in gut , in particular proton decay that we see shortly . because we have inverted hierarchy of the charged leptons",
    ", we have _ mostly off - diagonal @xmath60 and @xmath61 _ with respect to the one with normal hierarchy , @xmath62 now there is no transition between @xmath38 and @xmath18 , @xmath63 by @xmath37 boson exchange , but there is one between @xmath38 and @xmath40 , @xmath64 . in more general contortions , @xmath65 can be any element of permutation symmetry of order 3 , @xmath66 , which is a discrete subgroup of @xmath67 .    in string compactifications , gauge bosons and matter fermions",
    "have similar embedding as gut @xcite .",
    "however we do not break them by higgs mechanism , but by projection conditions associated with symmetries of internal manifold , just leaving footprints of unified multiplets .",
    "the fermion mass hierarchy is determined by geometry @xcite , from distributions of fields in the internal spaces .",
    "thus we can have large suppression for down - type quarks while having small suppression for leptons in the same multiplet and vice versa .",
    "thus the contortion naturally arises in string theory .    because of symmetric yukawa coupling , we can not contort @xmath68 sector with respect to @xmath69 in @xmath7 .",
    "also @xmath68 and @xmath38 sectors are related by ckm matrix , so we have a similar hierarchy between up and down type quarks .",
    "we can further generalize the idea , as in ( [ twistlr ] ) , by exchanging _ only the right - handed _ fermions between different generations , @xmath70 or @xmath71 then we have more freedom for quark and lepton masses . in particular in @xmath7 ,",
    "highly asymmetric texture is possible , thus the ` minimal ' @xmath7 can be different .",
    "for example if we exchange @xmath69 and @xmath72 to form a contorted family , the original symmetry constraint from @xmath73 on @xmath74 becomes @xmath75",
    "for the association of quark and lepton generations , the only direct experiment have been the proton decay @xcite .",
    "first we consider the effect of dimension six operators .",
    "the typical proton decay amplitude is @xmath76 mediated by @xmath77 bosons @xcite , @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the low energy contribution from hadronic matrix element , can be calculated by lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "@xmath80 are respectively the proton mass , the pion decay constant , the unified gauge coupling , the renormalization factor . @xmath81 and @xmath82 are interaction strength between baryons and mesons obtained from chiral perturbation theory . neglecting the last factor ,",
    "the partial lifetime for susy case is @xmath83 the gauge boson mass is guided by running gauge coupling : @xmath84 gev for non - susy and @xmath85 gev for susy cases @xcite . considering a typical decay channel like @xmath76",
    ", we have the partial mean lifetime , in non - susy case @xmath86 years , depending on extensions .",
    "the observed bound for the proton lifetime is @xmath87 years @xcite .",
    "the last factor contains rbcms , which are respectively the components of @xmath88 , all of which lie outside ckm and pmns .",
    "the amplitude is highly flavor dependent @xcite . in the minimal @xmath7 ,",
    "all the elements are set to identity as above , except @xmath89 so the flavor factor is nearly 5 .",
    "the flipped @xmath7 @xcite contains only the first term in the last factor @xcite .",
    "if we contort the first two generations as in ( [ rediag ] ) , then we have @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "thus the transition from quark to lepton is dominated by off - diagonal elements",
    ". eventually the proton decay is dominated by muon .",
    "consequently from ( [ pdecaywid ] ) there can be no @xmath76 , but _ opens proton decay channels to other leptons , _ like @xmath92 with the same lifetime as the original case .",
    "the bound for this process is @xmath93 years , is almost same order of magnitude to proton decay into positron .",
    "thus large off - diagonal rbcm element does not help much .",
    "there have been only water ( e.g. super - kamiokande ) and earthly metal ( e.g. iron in soudan ii ) based experiments , thus are able to identify decay from protons and neutrons , consisting of up and down quarks as initial states .",
    "so if the electron is connected with other quarks than @xmath94 , we can not observe the decay from other sources .",
    "the pairing @xmath95 is achieved if we invert the first and the third generation leptons .",
    "the outgoing state would be @xmath96 , instead of @xmath97 . in this case",
    "the proton can not decay into tauon , since it is heavier ( @xmath98 mev@xmath58 ) than proton ( @xmath99 mev@xmath58 ) .",
    "thus if the tauon component of the mixing is high , we will lose decay information for @xmath100 .",
    "however still there are decay channels @xmath101 where we can not distinguish the flavor of neutrino , since we only seek missing energy .",
    "notably this decay does not exist in the flipped @xmath7 .    in some model , with contortion like ( [ twistlr ] ) , we can suppress some nucleon decay by dimension six operators , however it is very hard to overcome the constraint from ( [ ptonupi ] ) and ( [ ntonupi ] ) .",
    "it is because , exchanging right - handed quarks and leptons , there is always a pair @xmath102 in almost all known unification models .",
    "thus a nucleon decay into neutrino is very important verification of all kind of gut interactions @xcite .",
    "we may make theory with just simple exchange @xmath103 to have a generation @xmath104 , without mass inversion",
    ". then we can easily see that , since the rbcm does not change @xmath105 , so that proton always decays into the lightest lepton , whatever name it has .",
    "thus we have no change .",
    "the most dominant dimension five proton decay operators of @xmath106 type in susy @xmath7 gut.,height=132 ]    although the dimension six operators are not so harmful in susy gut , there are relevant dimension five operators from integrating out the triplet higgs pair , known as @xmath107 and @xmath108 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 at the unification scale . here",
    "@xmath111 is the triplet higgs mass , obtained by unification condition .",
    "because of @xmath112 contractions , @xmath113 vanishes if the family indices satisfy @xmath114 and @xmath115 vanishes if @xmath116 .",
    "considering all the contribution , the dominant decay channels are @xmath117 for @xmath107 , a ` box ' diagram dressed with wino loop , and @xmath118 for @xmath108 with higgsino loop , depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : r4 ] .",
    "the latter has amplitude @xmath119_{l^4 } + [ a_\\tau(\\tilde t_r )     + a_\\tau(\\tilde c_r)]_{r^4},\\ ] ] where @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are weak coupling , wino mass and mu parameter , respectively .",
    "the experimental bound is @xmath123 years , which is blind to neutrino species , so it includes all the species .    in the minimal @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath125 contain the same phase matrix @xmath33 which belongs to a diagonal @xmath34 .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath107 operators can be suppressed by destructive interference between two amplitudes mediated by scharm @xmath126 and stop @xmath127 , adjusting phases @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "also it is calculated that the @xmath108 operators for the tau neutrino decay contributes much larger , enhanced by tau and top yukawa couplings and the mu parameter @xcite .",
    "there the term ( [ 5rscharm ] ) with right - scharm loop was neglected , due to yukawa suppression by @xmath129 in the amplitude .",
    "in fact the suppression power is closer to 1 , since we have additional ckm factors to have @xmath130 . in the minimal @xmath7 ,",
    "both @xmath131 and @xmath132 have the same phase @xmath133 .",
    "we note that in the minimal @xmath7 it is implicitly used that @xmath134 . in a contorted model ,",
    "if it became small , the stop exchange amplitude could be comparable to that with scharm loop .",
    "this can be done by exchanging tauon with muon or electron , as in ( [ twistgen ] ) , because we then have @xmath135 where @xmath65 is now mostly off - diagonal in ( 23 ) , or ( 13 ) components , as in ( [ rediag ] ) .",
    "considering the former case @xmath136 , from @xmath137 we have @xmath138 so that @xmath139 then an additional phase in the rbcm @xmath140 would help to cancel @xmath108 part . besides this effect",
    ", a contortion on the lepton sector does not affect other vertices of the proton decay operator , except the common part @xmath141 .",
    "in fact this part quite insensitive to our contortion because of large mixing of pmns matrix . in the latter case @xmath142 , we have @xmath143 and @xmath144 thus the stop and scharm loop contributions are smaller and comparable . in any case",
    "there must be enhancement in operators including the electron or the muon , since now either @xmath145 or @xmath146 .",
    "thus we can not suppress all the @xmath108 operator contribution simultaneously . in the case of twisting between electron and tauon , with the dominant channel @xmath147 ,",
    "we can enhance the proton lifetime by the factor @xmath148 with respect to ( [ 5rstop ] ) .",
    "this restores minimum peak of the @xmath149 back to @xmath150 , while pushing @xmath151 to higher @xmath152 .",
    "there are no sizable enhancements in the other box diagrams due to small yukawa couplings @xmath153 or @xmath154 .",
