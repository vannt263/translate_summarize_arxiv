    "a special role in @xmath3 violation searches plays a neutral kaon system which , due to a sensitivity to a variety of symmetry violation effects , is one of the best candidates for such kind of studies .",
    "one of the possible tests is based on the comparison between semileptonic asymmetry in @xmath5 decays ( @xmath6 ) and the analogous asymmetry in @xmath7 decays ( @xmath8)@xcite . so far the @xmath8@xcite was determined with a precision more than two orders of magnitude better than @xmath6@xcite .",
    "the present accuracy of @xmath6 determination is dominated by the statistical uncertainty .",
    "therefore the aim of this work is a determination of @xmath6 with two times smaller statistical error due to four times bigger data sample and improved systematical uncertainties .",
    "charge asymmetry is also an important source of information about the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath3 violating parameter  @xmath9 . until now @xmath10 was known with much worse precision than @xmath11 .",
    "the measurement was performed using kloe detector@xcite located at da@xmath12ne accelerator@xcite in the national laboratory in frascati , italy .",
    "the experimental data used in this paper has been collected during data campaign in 2004 - 2005 .",
    "neutral kaons are the lightest particles which contain a strange quark . observed short - living @xmath5 and long - living @xmath7 are linear combinations of strange eigenstates ( @xmath13 and  @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 where introduced small parameter @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "can be rewritten to separate @xmath18 and @xmath3 violation parameters @xmath19 and @xmath9 , respectively : @xmath20     and @xmath21 semileptonic decay . ]    in the standard model decay of @xmath22 ( or @xmath21 ) state is associated with the transition of the @xmath23 quark into @xmath24 quark ( or @xmath25 into @xmath26 ) and emission of the charged boson .",
    "change of strangeness ( @xmath27 ) implies the corresponding change of electric charge ( @xmath28 ) ( see figure  [ feynmann_diagrams_semi ] ) .",
    "this is so called @xmath29 rule .",
    "therefore decays of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are present but @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not .",
    "decay amplitudes for semileptonic decays of states @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be written as  follows@xcite : @xmath36 where the @xmath37 is a part of hamiltonian corresponding to the weak interaction and @xmath38 ,  @xmath39 ,  @xmath40 ,  @xmath41 parameters describe the semileptonic decay amplitudes . applying the symmetry operators to above",
    "amplitudes a set of relations between them can be obtained ( table  [ tab_relations ] ) .",
    "semileptonic decay amplitudes can be associated with the @xmath42 and @xmath43 semileptonic decay widths through the charge asymmetry  ( @xmath44 ) : @xmath45                  \\\\               &    \\mbox { if } \\delta q = \\delta s   \\nonumber \\\\           & = 2 \\left [ re \\left ( \\epsilon_{k } \\right ) \\pm re \\left ( \\delta_{k }   \\right )               + re \\left ( \\frac{b}{a } \\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\           &   \\mbox { if } \\mathcal{cpt }   \\mbox { and } \\delta q = \\delta s   \\nonumber \\\\           & = 2 \\left [ re \\left ( \\epsilon_{k } \\right )   \\right ]     \\nonumber       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where above equation contains only the first order of symmetry - violating terms .",
    "moreover , conservation of @xmath46 rule and @xmath3 symmetry simplifies equation  [ eq4 ] .",
    "determination the value of charge asymmetry for @xmath42 and @xmath43 allows for tests the fundamental assumptions of standard model .",
    ".relations between discrete symmetries and semileptonic amplitudes . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the charge asymmetry for @xmath43 decays was precisely determined by ktev experiment at fermilab@xcite .",
    "the measurement was based on 1.9 millions @xmath47 decays produced in collision of proton beam with beo target . at present the most accurate measurement of @xmath42 charge asymmetry was conducted by kloe collaboration@xcite . obtained",
    "charge asymmetry for @xmath42 decays is consistent in error limits with charge asymmetry for @xmath43 decays which suggest conservation of @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "however , this result is dominated by a statistical uncertainty which is three times larger than the systematic one .",
    "nevertheless it can be improved by analysing 1.7 @xmath48 total luminosity data sample acquired in 2004 and 2005 .",
    "the kloe experiment located at da@xmath12ne @xmath49 factory is specially suited for analysis of @xmath50 decay .",
    "the kloe detector is constituted by two main components : a drift chamber and an electromagnetic calorimeter , both inserted into an axial magnetic field ( 0.52  t ) . due to the size of the kloe drift chamber , about 40% of @xmath7 mesons decay inside the detector while the rest reach the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "detection of @xmath43 interaction in the calorimeter allows to identify a @xmath42 meson on the opposite side of @xmath49 meson decay point .    in order to select semileptonic decay of @xmath5 meson",
    ", an additional kinematic selection is applied .",
    "it starts from a requirement of a vertex formed by tracks of two oppositely charged particles near the interaction point .",
    "those tracks must be associated to calorimeter clusters . obtained tracks parameters",

    "the time of flight technique aims at rejection of the background , which is mainly due to @xmath58 events , and at identification of the final charge states ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
