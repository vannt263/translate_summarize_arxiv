    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are a class of interacting binary system comprised of a white dwarf that is accreting matter from a red dwarf companion via roche lobe overflow ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comprehensive review of these systems ) .",
    "dwarf novae are a subclass of cvs in which the k or m dwarf donor star fills its roche lobe and the transferred matter forms an accretion disk around the weakly - magnetised white dwarf ( magnetic field @xmath0 g ; e.g. @xcite , referred to as non - magnetic )",
    ". accretion on to the white dwarf occurs via a boundary layer between the rapidly spinning inner accretion disk and the more slowly spinning white dwarf .",
    "these systems undergo episodic outbursts , with typical recurrence timescales varying between @xmath1days and several decades .",
    "the outburst mechanism is generally explained by the disk instability model ( e.g. @xcite , see @xcite for a thorough treatment ) . in this model , the disk viscosity is believed to be too low during quiescence to transport the accreted matter steadily through the disk and onto the white dwarf surface .",
    "therefore , the disk density gradually increases up to a critical point whereupon it becomes optically thick , the temperature and viscosity increase , and mass is rapidly transferred through the disk onto the white dwarf , causing an outburst .",
    "the outburst duration is believed to depend on the mass present in the disk at the onset of the instability @xcite , and the rise and decay times correspond to the duration over which the heating or cooling front propagates @xcite . a source may exhibit alternating long and short outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the effects of tidal dissipation and heating of the outer disk by the impact of the accretion stream , as well as the mass transfer rate fluctuating in a small range about a critical value .    with a degenerate compact object accreting matter from a less - evolved donor star , dwarf",
    "novae show many similarities to low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "however , while the existence of jets has been confirmed in certain accretion states of both black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries with the exception of the high - magnetic field neutron star systems ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) , few cvs have been well studied at radio wavelengths . until recently",
    ", it was believed that dwarf novae , and cvs in general , did not launch jets , placing strong constraints on the jet - launching mechanism .",
    "given the prevalence of jets in all other known classes of object with accretion disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the absence of jets in dwarf novae was surprising .",
    "good evidence for the existence of jets from accreting white dwarfs has been found in at least ten of the @xmath2200 known symbiotic systems @xcite , which are systems consisting of a white dwarf accreting material from a red giant companion star .",
    "however , these systems are not believed to contain accretion disks .",
    "accretion is instead thought to proceed via bondi - hoyle capture , with the observed outbursts usually being attributed to a thermonuclear runaway of the accreted material on the surface of the white dwarf . during the 2006 nova explosion of the symbiotic recurrent nova rs  oph , highly - collimated bipolar jets ending in moving synchrotron - emitting lobes",
    "were directly resolved by radio imaging @xcite .",
    "although the outbursts of recurrent novae such as rs  oph are traditionally explained as nuclear explosions on the white dwarf surface , @xcite instead suggest that this system is in fact a dwarf nova with a very large accretion disk , which could then provide a mechanism for launching and collimating the observed jets .",
    "transient jets have also been observed in super soft x - ray sources .",
    "these very luminous objects contain a highly - accreting white dwarf thought to be undergoing steady nuclear burning .",
    "however , the steady nuclear burning requires mass transfer rates at least 10 times higher than than those occurring in cvs , and occurs via thermally - unstable roche lobe overflow , where the donor star is more massive than the accreting object .",
    "radio observations of the dwarf nova ss  cyg during its 2007 april outburst revealed variable radio emission , consistent with a partially self - absorbed jet @xcite .",
    "radio observations of subsequent ss  cyg outbursts have also shown radio flaring during outburst , followed by fainter , steady emission , with no radio quenching during the outburst @xcite .",
    "recently , four non - magnetic nova - like systems , which are cvs with mass transfer rates sufficiently high that their accretion disk is maintained in a constant hot state , have also been detected at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , the radio emission mechanism for nova - like systems remains unclear , with possibilities including synchrotron , gyrosynchrotron or coherent emission @xcite .    during a typical outburst ,",
    "x - ray binaries evolve through a range of characteristic accretion states ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , defined by specific x - ray spectral and variability behaviour .",
    "the power and morphology of the jets in these systems is very well coupled with the observed x - ray state in both black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) systems , implying a fundamental coupling between inflow in the accretion disk and outflow in the jets .",
    "specifically , in black hole systems the hard x - ray states seen at the beginning and end of an outburst are associated with steady , slightly inverted or flat - spectrum ( @xmath3@xmath40 , where the source flux density @xmath5 varies with frequency @xmath6 as , @xmath7 ) , compact jets , whereas bright , optically - thin ( @xmath8 ) , relativistically - moving ejecta are seen at transitions to the soft states ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "low - magnetic field neutron star x - ray binaries trace out similar x - ray evolution patterns to their black hole counterparts @xcite , and the disk - jet coupling is also believed to be broadly similar in these systems @xcite , with radio emission being triggered at transitions between hard and soft states just as in the black hole systems @xcite .",
    "ss  cyg is the prototypical dwarf nova , located at a distance of 114@xmath92pc @xcite .",
    "this object has a very well - sampled optical light curve @xcite stretching back to its discovery in 1896 @xcite .",
    "the long - term behaviour of ss  cyg shows an outburst recurrence time of @xmath10d and a bimodal distribution of outburst durations , with peaks at 7 and 14d @xcite . during outburst ,",
    "the visual magnitude rises from the quiescent visual magnitude of @xmath1112 to @xmath118.5 . despite the bimodal distribution of outburst durations",
    ", this system displays a narrow range of outburst rise and decay times , exhibiting a rise of @xmath12dmag@xmath13 and a decay rate of @xmath14dmag@xmath13 @xcite . a small fraction ( @xmath217% ; @xcite ) of outbursts",
    "are observed to be slow - rise ( historically referred to as `` anomalous '' ) , which rise at a rate of between 1.25 and 3.75dmag@xmath13 , and do not appear to be strongly peaked around one particular rise time @xcite .",
    "the most detailed ultraviolet and x - ray coverage ( probing the inner regions of the accretion flow ) of an outburst from ss  cyg was provided by @xcite , using data from the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "these observations showed that the initial optical rise was accompanied by a hard x - ray flare , which rapidly quenched as the boundary layer became optically thick to its own radiation and cooled efficiently , causing the hard x - rays to give way to the extreme ultraviolet emission .",
    "residual hard x - ray emission persisted through the outburst phase ( fainter than quiescent levels ) before rising again , more slowly this time , at the end of the optical and ultraviolet decay phase , before eventually fading back to quiescent levels .",
    "following up on the detection of radio emission during outburst @xcite , ss  cyg was targeted with a multi - wavelength monitoring campaign during its 2010 april outburst .",
    "triggered from monitoring data provided by the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) , the 2010 campaign included radio observations taken with the very large array ( vla ) , the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the european very long baseline interferometry network ( evn ) at radio wavelengths , aavso in the optical band , as well as _",
    "rxte _ and _ swift _ at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "in section [ sec : observations ] we describe this observing campaign and our data analysis methods .",
    "we detail our results in section [ sec : results ] , and go on to discuss the nature of the radio emission and implications for the jet - disk coupling in section [ sec : jd_coupling ] , before summarising our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "following notification from the aavso in 2010 april that a new outburst of ss  cyg was underway , we triggered radio observations during the commissioning phase of the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) and were able to get on source within 24h of the alert ( project code am991 ) .",
    "our initial trigger observation was made with the x - band system , using 256mhz of contiguous bandwidth centered at 8.46ghz .",
    "following the initial radio detection , we switched the observing band to c - band , observing in two 128-mhz sub - bands , each made up of 64 channels of width 2mhz , centred at 4.6 and 7.9ghz .",
    "we obtained 9 epochs of vla data over the course of 19 days before the outburst finished ( determined by aavso monitoring ) .",
    "the observations are summarised in table [ tab : evla ] . throughout the observing campaign ,",
    "the array was in its most compact d - configuration .",

    "flux density errors are statistical uncertainties on the fitted source parameters ( systematic uncertainties of 1% have not been included ) . specified modified julian dates ( mjds ) are for the mid - point of the observation , with the quoted uncertainty of @xmath90.01days reflecting the observation duration .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      and section  [ sec : align ] ) .",
    "we also plot representative black hole and neutron star systems , as well as transitional millisecond pulsars ( tmsps ) , with their proposed @xmath15 correlations . during its brightest radio flare ( which only lasted a few hours ; figure  [ fig : variabilityevn ] ) , the @xmath16/@xmath17 of ss  cyg appeared as radio bright as the proposed tmsp track ( @xmath18 , shown by the dot - dashed line ; @xcite ) but remained a factor of @xmath24 below the expected radio luminosity of black holes at similar x - ray luminosities ( shown by the dashed line ) . during the plateau and decay phase ,",
    "ss  cyg was as radio bright as the @xmath19 @xcite neutron star correlation extrapolated to low x - ray luminosities ( shown by the shallower dotted line , where the steeper dotted line shows the @xmath21.4 correlation ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , dwarf novae could be a source of confusion for quiescent neutron star systems when classifying them using radio / x - ray ratio , but not black holes . ]",
    "compact radio jets are observed from both black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "while there are clear similarities between the two classes of object , there are important quantitative differences .",
    "for example , neutron star systems produce lower radio luminosities , @xmath16 ( defined as @xmath20 ) , at a given x - ray luminosity , @xmath17 , to their black hole counterparts @xcite and the two classes display different correlations .",
    "black holes generally exhibit a slope of 0.63@xmath90.03 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while neutron star systems are thought to display a slope of @xmath20.7 for atoll and z sources or @xmath21.4 for hard state atoll sources @xcite .",
    "although transitional millisecond pulsars , tmsps , may exhibit a similar @xmath16 to @xmath17 relationship as black hole systems ; @xcite .",
    "recent works have used an object s behaviour in the @xmath16/@xmath17 plane to classify its nature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , although x - ray observations of dwarf novae do not sample the full accretion luminosity and can not be used to compare the emission mechanisms between cvs and other objects , determining the @xmath16/@xmath17 ratio is important to understanding whether cvs could be a source of confusion when classifying black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries .    during its initial radio flaring phase ,",
    "ss  cyg brightened to a radio luminosity of @xmath214.4@xmath2210@xmath23ergs@xmath13 at a corresponding x - ray luminosity of @xmath211@xmath2210@xmath24ergs@xmath13 ( table  [ tab : lrlx ] ) , which is a factor of @xmath24 below the black hole correlation at similar x - ray luminosities ( figure  [ fig : lrlx ] ) .",
    "while this radio bright phase could produce a similar radio / x - ray correlation to the proposed tmsp relationship , the initial bright radio flare only lasted @xmath24hours ( figure  [ fig : variabilityevn ] ) before rapidly fading to around a factor of @xmath24 less radio bright than the proposed tmsp radio luminosity at that x - ray luminosity ( in @xmath22 hours ) . during the plateau and decay phase of its outburst ( which are more analogous to the low / hard states of their black hole and neutron star counterparts ) , ss  cyg showed a much higher radio luminosity than the widely adopted @xmath25 neutron star x - ray binary correlation @xcite .",
    "however , the observed luminosities could appear to be consistent with an @xmath19 neutron star correlation .",
    "these results show that while a flaring dwarf novae could not masquerade as a black hole , it could be a source of confusion to neutron star classification .    while black hole x - ray binaries exhibit strong quenching of the compact radio jet during their soft states ( by up to 2.5 orders of magnitude ; @xcite ) , at least two neutron star systems ( 4u 1820@xmath2630 and ser x-1 ; @xcite ) did not exhibit this same jet suppression in analogous accretion states ( the neutron star system mxb 1730@xmath26335 may have also remained unquenched during outburst ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , strong radio quenching has been observed in the neutron star systems aquila x-1 @xcite , gx 9@xmath279 @xcite and possibly 4u 1728@xmath2634 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lack of radio suppression in ss  cyg suggests a common ( or similar ) launching process between dwarf novae and those neutron star x - ray binaries that do not exhibit strong radio quenching .",
    "our outburst comparison suggests that a vertically - extended region ( i.e. the boundary layer ) may be an important factor for the origin of the radio emission from ss  cyg .",
    "this result is consistent with the production of steady radio jets in both neutron star x - ray binaries and their black hole counterparts .",
    "neutron star x - ray binaries possess a vertically - extended boundary layer , while black hole systems launch steady jets during their low / hard states @xcite , where the central regions of the inflow consist of a geometrically - thick radiatively inefficient accretion flow @xcite . the observed jet suppression in black hole systems is then thought to occur when the accretion flow becomes geometrically - thin during their soft states , whereas the magnetic field may play a role in the observed radio quenching of some neutron star systems @xcite .",
    "we have compared the evolution of multiple radio outbursts of ss  cyg , demonstrating that the radio behaviour is reproducible during typical outbursts ( both long and short duration ) .",
    "our multi - frequency and high - resolution observations favour synchrotron emission over free - free and coherent emission mechanisms . comparing the unquenched radio emission with optical",
    ", extreme - uv and x - ray monitoring shows that the radio emission appears to be switched on as disk material first reaches the white dwarf boundary layer .",
    "these results indicate that the boundary layer may play a role in jet production in these systems .",
    "we observed rapid radio variability ( on @xmath2830minute timescales ) at the peak of its outbursts .",
    "multiwavelength monitoring of ss  cyg showed radio luminosities well below what is expected for black holes at similar x - ray luminosities , but consistent with a @xmath19 neutron star radio / x - ray correlation extrapolated to low luminosities .",
    "our high - resolution monitoring provides marginal evidence for a resolved jet in one vlbi epoch . however , further observations are required to confirm this result .",
    "our results show that white dwarf systems are capable of launching jets and that a vertically extended flow may play a role in the jet launching process in these systems .",
