    "the source for the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite has been attributed to an unidentified type of matter with a negative parameter in the equation of state , the dark energy .",
    "the cosmological constant , @xmath1 , leading to the @xmath2-cosmology , is the simplest candidate for the dark energy . in @xmath2-cosmology",
    "the universe consists of two perfect fluids , namely , the dust fluid ( dark matter ) with zero pressure , and the dark energy fluid which corresponds to the cosmological constant @xmath1 , with parameter , @xmath3 in the equation of state .",
    "the terms which correspond to the cosmological constant in the field equations can be seen in two ways , as a cosmic fluid  with constant energy density and constant negative parameter in the equation of state , or as an additional component which follows from the modification of the einstein - hilbert action in general relativity .",
    "however , @xmath4cosmology suffers from two major problems , the fine tuning and the coincidence problems @xcite .    in recent years other cosmological models",
    "have been introduced in order to explain the acceleration phase of the universe .",
    "some of them introduce a cosmic fluid into einstein s general relativity @xcite , while some other models modify the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the @xmath0-gravity in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker spacetime ( flrw ) with zero spatial curvature .",
    "@xmath0-gravity is a modified theory of gravity in which the action integral of the field equations is a function @xmath5 , of the ricci scalar @xmath6 of the underlying geometry @xcite ( for review see @xcite ) . in the case",
    "for which @xmath0 is a linear function , @xmath0-gravity reduces to standard general relativity , with or without the term due to the cosmological constant .",
    "the functional form of @xmath0 is still unknown and different forms for @xmath0 provide us with different dynamics , i.e. evolution of the universe .",
    "the well - known starobinsky model , with @xmath7 , has been proposed as an inflationary model of gravity @xcite .",
    "a class of viable models which describe the accelerated expansion of the universe can be found in @xcite .",
    "other models which have been proposed in the literature can be found in @xcite and references cited therein , while some cosmological data analysis of @xmath0 models can be found in @xcite    the purpose of this paper is the determination of the functional form of @xmath0 in order for the modified field equations to admit quadratic conservation laws . to perform this analysis",
    "we use the method of group invariant transformations , specifically the selection rule that we assume is that the field equations are invariant under a contact transformation which are defining as one - parameter transformations in the tangent bundle of the dynamical system .    according to the well - known noether s theorems , the existence of a group invariant transformation in the field equations is equivalent to the existence of conservation flow .",
    "noether s theorem states that for every one - parameter transformation of the action integral of a lagrangian function which transforms the action integral in such a way that the euler - lagrange equations are invariant .",
    "a conservation flow corresponds to the transformation .",
    "contact transformations are important in physical science as they are related with important conservation laws such as the runge - lenz vector , the lewis invariant ; contact transformations provide also the conservation law in the micz - problem @xcite    group invariant transformations cover a range of applications in gravitational physics and cosmology . for instance , lie point symmetries have been used for the determination of closed - form solutions in a model with charged perfect fluids in spherically symmetric spacetimes @xcite . on the other hand , noether point symmetries have been introduced as a selection rule for the determination of the functional form of the potential in scalar field cosmology in @xcite .",
    "since then that method has been applied in various cosmological models and new solutions have been found ( for instance see @xcite and references cited therein ) . in @xcite noether symmetries were applied in the scalar field cosmological scenario as a geometric selection rule for the determination of the functional form of the potential . in theories with minisuperspace , noether point symmetries are generated by the collineations of the minisuperspace .",
    "collineations are the generators of one - parameter transformations which transform geometric objects under a certain rule @xcite . however , the minisuperspace is defined by the cosmological model and the existence of collineations depends upon the model .",
    "hence the requirement of the existence of a noether point symmetry in the cosmological lagrangian is also a self - criterion because we let the theory select the functional form of the model .",
    "that selection rule is consistent with the geometric character of gravity .",
    "this geometric approach has been applied in various cosmological models and new integrable cosmologically viable models have arisen @xcite .    the application of noether ( point ) symmetries which are the generators of one - parameter point transformation for the @xmath0-cosmology in an flrw spacetime , in which the spacetime comprises a perfect fluid with zero pressure , has been performed before in @xcite . recently the same analysis has been performed and for a general perfect fluid with nonzero equation of state parameter @xcite , whereas for some locally rotational spacetimes the noether point symmetry classification of @xmath8-cosmology can be found in @xcite .",
    "some other @xmath8-models with closed - form solutions can be found in @xcite , while the application of point transformations in @xmath0-gravity in static spherically symmetric spacetimes can be found in @xcite    another geometric selection rule which is based upon the group invariant transformations of the wheeler - dewitt equations was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the existence of a lie point symmetry for the wheeler - dewitt equation is equivalent with the existence of a noetherian conservation law for the classical field equations .",
    "the main result was applied in a scalar field cosmological model with a perfect fluid for which a new integrable scalar field model was derived which it has been shown that the model provide us with a viable inflationary scenario @xcite    the application of contact symmetries in cosmological studies is not new .",
    "contact symmetries have been applied for the determination of conservation laws in various models in @xcite . in @xcite contact symmetries",
    "have been applied for the determination of the potential in scalar field cosmology . as in the case of point symmetries , contact symmetries ( or dynamical noether symmetries ) are also a geometric selection rule because they follow from a class of collineations of the minisuperspace which are called killing tensors . following the method which was presented in @xcite",
    "we apply the same selection rule for the determination of the unknown functional form , @xmath9 , in modified @xmath0-cosmology in the metric formalism .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .    in section [ field ]",
    "we present the field equations in @xmath8-gravity and we define our model which is a spatially flat flrw spacetime and contains a dustlike fluid which is not interacting with gravity in the action integral .",
    "the basic properties of the lie - bcklund symmetries and noether s theorem for contact transformations are given in section [ lbsym ] .",
    "in section [ conservationlaws ] , we use the killing tensors of the minisuperspace in order to determine the @xmath0-models in which the field equations are invariant under contact transformations . for each model",
    "we give the corresponding quadratic conservation law .",
    "we find five models which admit quadratic conservation laws .",
    "two of these have been found from the application of noether s theorem for one - parameter point transformations .    in section [ solutions ]",
    "we apply the extra conservation laws in order to reduce the order the dynamical system , which is defined by the field equations . for the three new integrable models we show that two of the models are supported by lie surfaces while the third model is supported by a liouville surface .  for each of the models we study the evolution of the equation of state parameter for the cosmological fluid which corresponds to @xmath0-gravity .",

    "this is also required in order for the final attractor of the field equations to be a de sitter point ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , condition @xmath47 is necessary in order to avoid the existence of ghosts .",
    "another important constrain in which the @xmath0 function should satisfies is @xmath48 , for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , is the ricci scalar today , in order the theory to be consistency with local gravity tests . on the other hand , the violation of the later constrain introduce tachyonic instability , and a nonwell defined post - newtonian limit @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from the solar system tests we have that @xmath51 which means that @xmath52 should reduced to general relativity . finally , if we assume that the at the late - time the model has a stable de sitter behavior then the following condition should be satisfied , @xmath53 at @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to general relativity , which is a second - order theory , @xmath52-gravity is a fourth - order theory .",

    "furthermore this selection rule is consistent with the geometric character of gravitational theories .",
    "the reason is that the group invariant transformation of the field equations is related with the geometry which the dependent variables define , in our consideration with the minisuperspace ( [ tr.10 ] ) .",
    "there exists a unique connection between the collineations of the minisuperspace and the symmetries of the field equations .",
    "in particular noether point symmetries are related with the elements of the conformal algebra of the minisuperspace @xcite , whereas as we discussed before contact symmetries are generated by the kts of the minisuperspace .",

    "on the other hand , analytical solutions are important in order to understand the evolution of the universe .",
