    "<S> measured @xmath0 production cross sections for 200 and 450 gev / c protons incident on a variety of nuclear targets are analyzed within a glauber framework which takes into account energy loss of the beam proton , the time delay of particle production due to quantum coherence , and absorption of the @xmath0 on nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the best representation is obtained for a coherence time of 0.5 fm / c , previously determined by drell - yan production in proton - nucleus collisions , and an absorption cross section of 3.6 mb , which is consistent with the value deduced from photoproduction of the @xmath0 on nuclear targets .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 13.85.ni , 24.85.+p , 11.80.la +    propagation of a highly relativistic particle through a medium is of interest in several areas of physics . high energy proton - nucleus scattering has been studied for many decades by both the nuclear and particle physics communities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such studies are particularly relevant for the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , which will collide beams of gold nuclei at an energy of 100 gev per nucleon , and for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which will collide beams of lead nuclei at 1500 gev per nucleon @xcite .    in a recent paper </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we modeled the production of high mass , drell - yan , pairs of leptons as measured in collisions of 800 gev / c protons incident on a variety of nuclear targets by the fermilab collaboration e772 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling was done on the basis of hadronic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we took into account the energy loss of the beam proton as it traversed the nucleus as well as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter basically acknowledges that there is a time ordering in the appearance of produced particles ; the hard particles ( drell - yan pairs ) appear before the soft particles ( typically pions ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a quantum mechanical effect , essentially the uncertainty principle . by fitting to the atomic mass number dependence of the drell - yan cross section at high feynman @xmath1 we were able to infer a value for the proper coherence or formation time of 0.4@xmath20.1 fm / c . </S>",
    "<S> this value is about what should be expected _ a priori_. in the center of mass frame of the colliding nucleons at the energies of interest a typical pion </S>",
    "<S> is produced with an energy of e@xmath3 mev . by the uncertainty principle </S>",
    "<S> this takes a time of order @xmath4 fm / c .    </S>",
    "<S> a related process is the production of @xmath0 in high energy proton - nucleus collisions which we shall address in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> this is also a relatively hard process and so both energy loss of the beam proton and the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect must be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is an additional effect which plays a role , and that is the occasional absorption or breakup of the @xmath0 in encounters with target nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> ( the inelastic interaction of one of the leptons in drell - yan production with target nucleons is ignorably small . ) </S>",
    "<S> the absorption cross section , @xmath5 , has been estimated in a straightforward glauber analysis without energy loss and with an infinite coherence / formation time to be about 6 - 7 mb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has formed the basis for many analyses of @xmath0 suppression in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> any anomalous suppression may be an indication of the formation of quark - gluon plasma @xcite , hence the importance of obtaining the most accurate value of @xmath5 possible . </S>",
    "<S> this cross section has also been inferred from photoproduction experiments of @xmath0 on nuclei from which a value much less than that has been obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been a puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> one attempt to resolve this apparent discrepancy consists of modeling the produced @xmath6 state as a pre - resonant color dipole state with two octet charges @xcite ; however , the results are only semi - quantitative .    for a basic description of high energy proton - nucleus scattering we prefer to work with hadronic variables rather than partonic ones . </S>",
    "<S> we make a straightforward linear extrapolation from proton - proton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this extrapolation , referred to as lexus , was detailed and applied to nucleus - nucleus collisions at beam energies of several hundred gev per nucleon in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and to drell - yan production in 800 gev proton - nucleus collisions in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in order to compute the production cross section of @xmath0 in proton - nucleus collisions </S>",
    "<S> we need a parametrization of it in the more elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions . for this </S>",
    "<S> we call upon the parametrization of a compilation of data by loureno @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the branching ratio into dimuons and @xmath9 is the ratio of the momentum carried by @xmath0 to the beam momentum in the center of mass frame @xmath10 . due to the degradation in momentum of the proton as it traverses the nucleus it is important to know the @xmath9 dependence of the production . </S>",
    "<S> the fermilab experiment e789 has measured this dependence at 800 gev / c @xcite to be proportional to @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that this holds at lower energy too we use the joint @xmath12 and @xmath9 functional dependence and magnitude : @xmath13 the cross section in proton - nucleus collisions can now be computed in lexus with no ambiguity .     </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath14 in proton - nucleus collisions at 200 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> the data is from na38 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is @xmath15 times the nucleon - nucleon production cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve represents full energy loss with zero coherence / formation time , while the banded region represents partial energy loss with a coherence / formation time within the limits set by drell - yan production . </S>",
    "<S> ( computations were done for c , al , cu , w and u and the points connected by straight lines to guide the eye.),width=377 ]    figures 1 and 2 show the results of our calculation in comparison to data taken by na38 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curves are @xmath15 times the nucleon - nucleon production cross section ; they obviously overestimate the data .        </S>",
    "<S> the solid curves show the result of lexus with full energy degradation of the beam proton without account taken of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect ; they obviously underestimate the data . </S>",
    "<S> the hatched regions represent the inclusion of the latter effect with a proper formation / coherence time @xmath16 in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 fm / c consistent with drell - yan production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time delay is implemented as follows @xcite : the energy available for the production of @xmath0 is that which the proton had @xmath17 collisions prior ; that is , the previous @xmath17 collisions are ignored for the purpose of determining the proton s energy . </S>",
    "<S> this is an approximate treatment of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 is related to the beam energy and to the coherence time @xmath16 in the center of mass frame of the colliding nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the proper coherence time is essentially the same as the proper formation time of a pion since most pions are produced with rapidities near zero in that frame . </S>",
    "<S> the first proton - nucleon collision is the most important , so boosting this time into the rest frame of the target nucleus and converting it to a path length ( proton moves essentially at the speed of light ) gives @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this path length may then be equated with @xmath17 times the mean free path @xmath19 . using a total cross section of 40 mb , a nuclear matter density of 0.155 nucleons/@xmath20 , and @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> fm / c we obtain @xmath22 at 200 gev / c and @xmath23 at 450 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> as may be seen from the figures , the data is overestimated , indicating the necessity for nuclear absorption .     </S>",
    "<S> absorption cross section of 3.6 mb.,width=377 ]     absorption cross section of 3.6 mb.,width=377 ]    we now introduce a @xmath0 absorption cross section on nucleons and compute its effect within lexus in the canonical way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the @xmath0 is created there will in general be a nonzero number of nucleons blocking its exit from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> knowing where the @xmath0 is created allows one to calculate how many nucleons lie in its path , and hence , to compute the probability that it will be dissociated into open charm . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a value of @xmath16 allowed by drell - yan measurements , mentioned above , and then vary @xmath5 , assuming that it is energy independent . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest value of chi - squared for the 200 and 450 gev / c data set taken together is obtained with @xmath24 fm / c and @xmath25 mb . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figures 3 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted values all lie within one standard deviation of the data points . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite a satisfactory representation of the data . </S>",
    "<S> it means that both drell - yan and @xmath0 production in high energy proton - nucleus collisions can be understood in terms of a conventional hadronic analysis when account is taken of the energy loss of the beam proton , the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect , and nuclear absorption of the @xmath0 in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> it also means that the absorption cross section for @xmath0 inferred from high energy proton - nucleus collisions is consistent with the value inferred from photoproduction experiments on nuclei </S>",
    "<S> .    it will be very instructive to repeat this analysis in the language of partonic variables . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the analysis with parton energy loss alone was reported by gavin and milana @xcite with satisfactory results obtained for drell - yan and @xmath0 if the partons lose about 1.5 gev / fm . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear shadowing @xcite needs to be taken into account too . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship among all these effects is not well - understood , nor is the relationship between these effects in partonic and hadronic variables . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the implications for nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite will undoubtedly be important ; they are under investigation . </S>"
