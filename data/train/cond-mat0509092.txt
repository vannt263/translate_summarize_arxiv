    "but it should be noted that these amplitude transmissions are not energy transmissions . what are their relation to the energy transmissions ?",
    "as already cited in the introduction part of this paper , several assumptions @xcite are made to calculate the energy transmissions from these amplitude transmissions .",
    "apart from this problem , any eigenvector for eq .",
    "( [ dymatrix ] ) can be multiplied by a whatever coefficient and it is still the eigenvector .",
    "it means that the choice of eigenvector is not unique because of the linear nature of the harmonic system .",
    "this indeterminacy will complicate the calculation of the amplitude transmissions and makes the amplitude transmission coefficients non - unique .",
    "however the energy transmissions are determined by the system and have unique values .",
    "the key to this problem is energy conservation , which means that the energy flux from the left and right lead should be equal .",
    "in this part , we use the energy flux eq .",

    "( [ dymatrix ] ) and it satisfies @xmath26 .",
    "it is obvious that our choice for the eigen mode is unique and deterministic .",

    "the reason for this is simple : the eigenvectors of eq .",

    "similar expression can be written down for the right lead .",
    "the total wave for one particular lead , say the left lead , is an arbitrary superposition of all these eigen modes .",
    "thus , the motion of the atoms is described by the wave : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an arbitrary amplitude of the mode @xmath46 in lead @xmath65 . with the help of our newly derived energy flux",

    "they will give the same energy flux from either of the lead .",

    "although all modes of a given frequency are considered , we did not find mode - mixing or mode - conversion behavior among acoustic modes at the lower frequency range .",
    "for example , the reflected and the transmitted waves across the junction for the incident la mode waves are both only la modes .",
    "we think that this is due to the high symmetrical properties of atomic motion for nanotubes .",
    "each travelling wave on nanotube has its own symmetrical property resulting from the symmetry of the nanotube structure .",
    "the symmetry on the left and right lead is different .",
    "it is hard to convert one specific high symmetrical motion to the other different symmetrical motion through the conjunction except when the symmetrical properties on each lead are the same .",

    "this appears related to the difference in rotational symmetries of these modes .",
    "the transmission for ta mode decreases with frequency .",
    "this can be accounted for two reasons : ( 1 ) although the ta mode is a common symmetry for both left and right lead , the kind of transverse symmetry is destroyed by the central junction part .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : nanotube1 ] that the central junction part does not have transverse symmetry .",
    "( 2 ) there is a mismatch of dispersion relation for ta mode because the ta mode has a nearly quadratic dispersion relation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanotube2 ] .",
    "these reasons will affect the transmission for ta mode at high frequency when the vibration motion of atoms is fast .",
    "so it can be seen from above that energy transmission across nanotube junctions is strongly dependent on symmetry property of the lead nanotube .",
    "this symmetry dependence is also observed by molecular dynamics.@xcite usually such mismatch in symmetry will reduce the number of possible transmission modes and thus blocks the thermal conduction across the junction .",
