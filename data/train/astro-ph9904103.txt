    "the properties of 4u0142 + 61  ( white et al .",
    "1987 ) remained puzzling for a long time , owing to confusion with a nearby pulsating and transient be / neutron star system rxj0146.9 + 6121 ( motch et al . 1991 ; mereghetti et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the 110  kev spectrum is extremely soft ( power law photon index of @xmath6 , white et al .",
    "1987 ) and led to the initial classification of 4u0142 + 61  as a possible black hole candidate .",
    "asca observations provide evidence for a @xmath7  kev blackbody component contributing @xmath8% of the 0.510 kev band x  ray flux ( white et al .",
    "the x  ray luminosity of 4u  0142 + 61 has not shown substantial secular variations around an average value of @xmath9  erg  s@xmath3 ( assuming a distance of 1  kpc ) . despite the small error box ( 5  radius ) , no optical or ir counterpart has yet been identified , down to @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( steinle et al .",
    "1987 ; white et al . 1987 ; coe & pightling 1998 ) .",
    "these limits rule out the presence of a massive companion . using data from the exosat archive , israel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) discovered pulsations at 8.7 s , which were later confirmed with rosat ( hellier 1994 ) .",
    "no delays in the pulse arrival times caused by orbital motion were found , with upper limits on @xmath14sin @xmath15 of about @xmath16  lt ",
    "s for orbital periods @xmath17 between 7  min and 12  hr ( israel et al .",
    "tighter upper limits on the @xmath18 ( @xmath19  lt ",
    "s for 70s@xmath20 2.5days ) have been recently obtained with a rxte   observation ( wilson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this yielded strong constraints on the orbital inclination and the mass of the possible companion star in the case of normal or helium main sequence star and giants with helium core .",
    "a white dwarf companion would be compatible both with current optical photometric and pulse arrival time limits .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we also fit the lecs and mecs spectra of observation a with other two  component spectral models , such as a power  law with a cut  off ( @xmath21/dof = 453.2/344 ) , two blackbodies ( @xmath21/dof = 503.1/344 ) and a broken power  law ( @xmath21/dof = 400.6/344 ) .",
    "all these models gave substantially worse fits than the power ",
    "law plus blackbody model .",
    "similar results were obtained for the spectrum of observation d. since the blackbody peaks are close to the lower end of the mecs energy range we also checked these results by analysing the lecs data only ( which cover a wider spectral range than the mecs;see table 2 and discussion ) .",
    "we also checked the stability of the results obtained by rebinning by a factor of @xmath03 the pha channels in the lecs and mecs spectra . again all the bins which were consistent with zero after background subtraction were rejected from the analysis .",
    "no significant variation in the spectral parameters and uncertainties were found for either models .",
    "the data from the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) and the phoswich detector system ( pds ) did not hold any useful information on 4u0142 + 61 .",
    "in fact , due to the large fovs of these intruments and the steep spectrum of 4u0142 + 61 , the counts above 10 kev were likely dominated by the nearby source rx j0146.9 + 6121 .",
    "the arrival times of the 0.510  kev photons from 4u0142 + 61   were corrected to the barycenter of the solar system and 1s binned light curves accumulated for each observation .",
    "the average count rates are reported in table1 .",
    "the mecs counts were used to determine the 4u0142 + 61  pulse period . the data from observations a , b and d were divided into 6 , 4 , and 5 time intervals , respectively and for each interval the relative phase of the pulsations was determined .",
    "these phases were then fit with a linear function giving a best  fit period of @xmath22  s for observation a ( see table3 ) . for observation b a period of @xmath23  s was obtained , while during observation c pulsations were not detected owing to poor statistics ( @xmath0 11000 photons ) to detect such a weak ( @xmath06% pulsed fraction ) signal .",
    "finally for observations d we determined a period of 8.6883@xmath240.0001s .",
    "beppo_sax  pulse period values are plotted in fig.4 together with the previous measurements ( see sect.3 for the rxte  measurement ) .",
    "the background subtracted light curves from observation a , folded at the best period in different energy ranges ( fig.3 ; first three panels ) show a double  peaked profile ( see also white et al .",
    "the pulsed fraction ( semiamplitude of modulation divided by the mean source count rate ) was 7.1@xmath241.5% , 7.5@xmath240.5% and 13@xmath242% in the 0.51.5 kev , 1.54.0 kev and 4.010 kev energy bands , respectively .",
    "similar results are obtained for observations b and d.    flux variations on several timescales are usually displayed by high accretion rate x  ray pulsars ; we found no short or long  term variations in any of the _ beppo_sax  accumulated light curves .",
    "the upper two panels of fig.5 show the pulsed fraction versus energy during observation a for the first two harmonics .",
    "these values were obtained by fitting the corrisponding light curves with two sinusoidal functions .",
    "the first harmonic shows a nearly constant value ( @xmath0 6% ) up to 4kev , while at higher energies increases to about 15% . a constant value of 57%",
    "is inferred for the second harmonic .",
    "we calculated also the root mean square variability ( rms ; defined as @xmath25 devided by the mean source count rate , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the observed and expected variance , respectively ) of the folded light curve at different energies ( third panel ) .",
    "finally the ratio between the power  law and the total flux for the blackbody plus power  law spectral model is shown ( lowest panel ) . from the comparison of these quantites",
    "we can infer that : ( i ) since the rms variability of the folded light curves is @xmath28 times the geometric sum of the amplitudes in all available harmonics ( mainly the 1@xmath29 and 2@xmath30 in the present case ) , it is apparent that the behaviour is consistent with the derived amplitudes of the 1@xmath29 and 2@xmath30 harmonics ; ( ii ) there is evidence for an increase of the pulsed fraction ( @xmath0 2@xmath31 confidence level ) at energies above 5 kev ; ( iii ) there is not a simple relationship between the pulsed fraction and the flux in either of the two spectral component adopted in our analysis .",
    "a set of four phase ",
    "resolved spectra ( phase boundaries 0.06 , 0.26 , 0.5 , 0.78 ) were accumulated for observation a ( i.e. the observation with the highest number of source counts ) .",

    "law plus blackbody model described in sect.2.1 , with n@xmath32 fixed at the phase ",
    "averaged best ",
    "fit value .",
    "initially , the blackbody temperature was fixed at its phase  averaged best ",
    "fit value and only the power  law parameters and blackbody normalisation were allowed to vary .",
    "the fits were then repeated with @xmath4 fixed and blackbody parameters and power  law normalisation free ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "no significant changes were detected for @xmath4 and @xmath5 as a function of the pulse phase .",
    "similar results were obtained for the fluxes of the two spectral component .",
    "the 4u0142 + 61  position was included in a rxte  observation pointed at the nearby high  mass x  ray binary pulsar rx j0146.9 + 6121 ( from 1996 march 28 11:16:48 to 22:09:20 ; @xmath020  ks of effective exposure time ) .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected in the so called  good xenon \" operating mode with the proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al .",
    "the pca consists of 5 proportional counters operating in the 260 kev range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000  @xmath33 and a field of view , defined by passive collimators , of @xmath34 fwhm .",
    "the data consist of the time of arrival and the pulse height of each count . in order to minimise the contamination from rxj0146.9 + 6121 ( a much harder spectrum x  ray pulsar )",
    ", we considered only photons in the 24 kev energy interval . in order to reduce the background ,",
    "only the counts detected in the first xenon layer of each counter were used .",
    "we obtained for 4u0142 + 61  a best pulse period of 8.6881@xmath240.0002s ( see table3 and fig.4 ) .",
    "figure6 shows the corresponding folded light curve . despite the uncertainties in the background subtraction ( the contribution from rxj0146.9 + 6121 is difficult to estimate )",
    ", it is apparent that the rxte / pca pulse profile of 4u0142 + 61  is similar to that observed with _",
    "the rxte  value we obtained is consistent to within the statistical uncertainties with that of wilson et al .",
    "( 1998 ; energy range 3.79.2 kev ) .",
    "the somewhat different pulse shape is likely due to the different energy band used .",
    "several models have been proposed in order to explain the nature of the `` anomalous '' x  ray pulsars .",
    "mereghetti & stella ( 1995 ) proposed that these sources form a homogeneous subclass of accreting neutron stars , perhaps members of low mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , which are characterized by lower luminosities ( @xmath35  erg  s@xmath3 ) and higher magnetic fields ( @xmath36  g ) than classical lmxbs .",
    "however the lack of evidence for a binary nature from any of these systems ( mereghetti et al . 1998 ;",
    "wilson et al . 1998 ) argues in favor of models in which the x  ray emission originates from a compact object that is not in an interacting binary system .",
    "van paradijs et al . (",
    "1995 ) proposed that axps are young population i objects , which originate from the evolution of short orbital period high mass x ",
    "ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , following the expansion of the massive star and the onset of unstable roche lobe overflow , before central hydrogen is exhausted ( see also cannon et al .",
    "the resulting common ",
    "envelope phase should cause the neutron star to spiral  in and disrupt the companion star after the so  called thorne  zytkov stage .",
    "therefore , these sources should consist of an isolated neutron star accreting matter from a residual disk with a mass in the @xmath37  m@xmath38 range .",
    "the blackbody component in 4u0142 + 61  and , likewise , other axps has been interpreted as evidence for quasi ",
    "spherical accretion onto an isolated neutron star formed after common envelope and spiral  in of a massive short  period ( p@xmath39@xmath40 1yr ) x  ray binary . in this case",
    "the remains of the envelope of the massive star might produce two different types of matter inflow : a spherical accretion component with low specific angular momentum giving rise to the blackbody component and a high specific angular momentum component which forms an accretion disk and is likely responsible for the power ",
    "law emission ( ghosh et al . 1997 ) .",
    "although some problems remain open in this scenario , we note that a post common  envelope evolutionary scenario for 4u0142 + 614 is also suggested by the inference that about half of the x  ray absorbing material is close to the source ( white et al . 1996 ) . in this context it is interesting to note that independent evidence supports the view that the binary x  ray pulsars 4u162667 and hd49798 were formed following a common envelope and spiral  in evolutionary phase ( see angelini et al . 1995 and israel et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the different properties of the companion stars in these two cases may reflect the fact that unstable mass transfer set in at different evolutionary phases in the nuclear evolution of their progenitors ( in turn , reflecting different initial masses and orbital periods ; see also ghosh et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "thompson & duncan ( 1993 , 1996 ) proposed that the axps are `` magnetars '' , neutron stars with a superstrong magnetic field ( @xmath41 g ) .",
    "this proposal is supported by the similarity in the pulse periods ( 8.05 , 7.5s and 5.16s ) and of p values measured in the soft @xmath42ray repeaters sgr052066 , sgr1806 - 20 and sgr1900 + 14 , respectively ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 ; hurley et al . 1998 ) .",
    "if this connection proved correct , axps , would be quiescent soft @xmath42ray repeaters .",
    "heyl & hernquist ( 1997 ) argued that their emission may be powered by the cooling of the core through a strongly magnetised envelope of matter ( made up mainly by hydrogen and helium ) .",
    "pulsations would originate from a temperature gradient on the surface of the star .",
    "moreover heyl & hernquist ( 1998 ) showed that in this scenario , spin  down irregularities , observed in the period history of two `` anomalous '' x  ray pulsars ( 1e2259 + 58 and 1e104859 ) , may be simply accounted for with glitches like those observed in young radio pulsars .",
    "the 0.510 kev spectrum of 4u0142 + 61  is well modelled by the sum of an absorbed steep power ",
    "law and a low  energy blackbody .",
    "the latter component was introduced by white et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the asca data ; the corresponding blackbody radius and flux were @xmath43 km ( at 1 kpc ) and @xmath040% of the total , respectively . neither the power ",
    "law photon index nor the blackbody temperature show evidence of changes across different _ beppo_sax  observations .",
    "we found marginal evidence ( at about 2@xmath31 confidence level ) for changes relative to previous observations .",
    "a comparison of the asca and _",
    "beppo_sax  results show that : ( i ) the power ",
    "law photon index increases by about 4% ( observations a and d ) ; ( ii ) the blackbody radius decreased by about 37% ( a ) and 12% ( d ) ; ( iii ) the blackbody flux decreased to @xmath030% ( a ) and @xmath035% ( d ) of the total flux therefore showing a @xmath010%5% decrease with respect to that of the asca observation ; ( iv ) the 0.510 kev total flux decreased of about 1512% .    by fixing the parameters",
    "n@xmath32 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 to the values inferred by asca , the _ beppo_sax  observation a spectrum gives a @xmath44/dof of 1.9/348 . in this case",
    "the blackbody component accounts for @xmath030% of the total flux ( @xmath010% lower than that of asca ) . as an additional test",
    "we also merged the data for observation a ( mecs 2 and 3 only ) and d and fit them with the power ",
    "law plus blackbody model ( see table2 ) .",
    "while a small change in the spectral parameters is found relative to observations a and d , separately , the blackbody flux is @xmath030% of the total .    to remove possible effects introduced by the vicinity of the lower end of the energy range of the mecs and the peak of the blackbody component , we also fitted the spectrum of observations a , d and a+d by using only the data as accumulated by the lecs , the energy band of which uninterruptely covers the range 0.59.0 kev and allows a better fit in the energy interval ( 14 kev ) where the power  law and the blackbody components overlap .",
    "again we obtained results similar to the lecs+mecs case , but with a larger uncertainty .",
    "all these results point to a marginal variation of the spectral parameters of 4u0142 + 61 , if any .",
    "the _ beppo_sax  data suggest that the pulsed fraction for energies above 4kev decreased ( from 25%@xmath245% with asca to 13%@xmath242% with _ beppo_sax ; 90% uncertainties ) . for these energies",
    "the counts are almost entirely dominated by the power  law component ( in the spectral model assumed ) .",
    "the pulse periods measured by _",
    "beppo_sax  show that 4u0142 + 61  has continued its secular spin  down during 19961998 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the period derivative inferred from the _",
    "beppo_sax  observations alone ( @xmath06.0@xmath45 @xmath110@xmath2 s s@xmath3 ) is consistent with the average spin  down rate ( @xmath02@xmath110@xmath2 s s@xmath3 ) inferred over the 19yr span of the historical dataset ( note that in the period list we did not include the low significance detections inferred on 1985 november 11 and december 11 with exosat me , and on 1991 february 13 with rosat hri ; israel et al .",
    "the inferred p for 4u0142 + 61  is consistent with the uncertainties of all pulse period measurements except , perhaps , one ( the 1979 _ einstein _",
    "sss one ; see fig.4 ) implying that , so far , no `` glitches '' have been observed yet .",
    "we would like to thank giancarlo cusumano for providing the mecs off  axis matrices and the _ beppo_sax  mission planning for their constant help .",
