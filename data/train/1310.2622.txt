    "laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa ) offers the potential to construct compact accelerators that has a numerous potential applications including the building blocks for a next generation linear collider and being the driver for compact light sources . as a result",
    ", lwfa has attracted extensive interest since it was originally proposed @xcite , and the last ten years has seen an explosion of experimental results . due to the strong nonlinear effects that are present in lwfa ,",
    "developing predictive theoretical models is challenging @xcite ; therefore numerical simulations are critical .",
    "in particular , particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations play a very important role in lwfa research because the pic algorithm follows the self - consistent interactions of particles through the electromagnetic fields directly calculated from the full set of maxwell equations . using a standard pic code to study",
    "a 10 gev stage in a nonlinear regime takes approximately 1 million core hours on today s computers and a 100 gev stage would take 100 million core hours . while computing resources now exist to do a few of such simulations , it is not possible to do parameter scans in full three - dimensions .",
    "therefore , reduced models such as combining the ponderomotive guiding center with full pic @xcite for the wake or with quasi - static pic @xcite are used for parameter scans . however , while these models are very useful , they can not model full pump depletion distances and the quasi - static approach can not model self - injection .",
    "another reduced model that has been recently proposed is to expand the fields in azimuthal mode numbers and truncate the expansion @xcite .",
    "this can reduce modeling a 3d problem with low azimuthal asymmetry into the similar computational cost as using a 2d @xmath3 code .",
    "recently , it was shown that by performing the simulation in an optimal lorentz boosted frame with velocity @xmath0 , the time and space scales to be resolved in a numerical simulation may be minimized @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that in the boosted frame the plasma length ( the laser propagation distance ) is lorentz contracted while the plasma wake wavelength and laser pulse length are lorentz expanded .",
    "the number of laser cycles is an invariant ( assuming there is no reflected wave ) so the necessary number of cells needed to resolve the laser is also an invariant while the cell size and hence time step are lorentz expanded .",
    "the increase in time step and decrease in the plasma length lead to savings of factors of @xmath1 as compared to a lab frame simulation using the so called moving window @xcite . using such simulations",
    ", it has been shown that using a 13  @xmath4 laser one could generate 10 gev electron beam in a self - guided stage and 50 gev in a channel guided stage @xcite .",
    "for these cases the savings can be larger than factors of @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the boosted frame lwfa simulations noise from a numerical instability can be an issue . as discussed in @xcite , the noise results from a numerical cerenkov instability induced by the plasma drifting with relativistic speeds on the grid . according to the dispersion relation this numerical instability",
    "is attributed to the coupling between the wave - particle resonances with em modes ( including aliased modes ) in the numerical system .",
    "the pattern of the instability in fourier space can be found at the intersections of the em dispersion relation of the solver used in the simulation algorithm , and the wave - particle resonances @xcite .    in order to mitigate this instability ,",
    "it is preferable to use an em solver that eliminates the numerical instability at the main beam resonance . in this case",
    ", the instability occurs only at high @xmath6 modes which are far away from the physics of interest . as the em dispersion curves for most fdtd solvers inevitably bends down ( i.e. , supports waves with phase velocities less than the speed of light ) at high @xmath6 , numerical instabilities at the main beam resonance are found in these solvers .",
    "however , when using a spectral solver that spatially advances the em fields in fourier space , the dispersion curve assures no instability pattern at the main beam resonance .",
    "in addition , the pattern at the first space aliasing beam mode is found to indeed be located at high @xmath7 values that are far away from the interested physics . for the spectral solver the numerical cerenkov instability is located at a predicted pattern in @xmath8 space so it can be conveniently eliminated by applying simple filters directly in @xmath9 space .    in this paper",
    "we describe the development of a fully parallelized three - dimensional electromagnetic spectral pic code called upic - emma that was rapidly built using components of the ucla pic framework ( upic ) @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that through the use of appropriate filters , lorentz boosted frame simulations of lwfa at the optimum frame velocities can be carried out without limitations from the numerical cerenkov instability .",
    "we show that a simple low pass filter with a hard cutoff at @xmath6 works very well .",
    "this completely eliminates modes with @xmath6 above a selected value .",
    "meanwhile , it is not as easy to use such a filter in @xmath6 space using a fdtd solver ( and such solvers have instabilities at lower @xmath10 ) .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when using the fdtd code to simulate relativistic plasma drift , an optimized time step has to be chosen to minimize the instability growth rate .",
    "while the instability growth rate is minimized , this time step does not lead to complete elimination of the instability and it can lead to further errors in numerical dispersion .",
    "additional smoothing and filtering can help as well , but unlike when using a spectral code the instability can not be essentially eliminated . for the spectral code ,",
    "the only errors in numerical dispersion arise from the use of finite time step . because , it is not necessary to use an optimum time step ( nor does one exist )",
    ", one can minimize the errors in numerical dispersion for the em waves by choosing smaller time steps if needed .",
    "one disadvantage with the spectral code is that it is not easy to use a moving window , however for the optimum @xmath2 no moving window is needed .",
    "we note that the use of a pseudo - spectral algorithm has recently been discussed and analyzed @xcite .",
    "this can easily be included into upic - emma if the algorithm is shown to have advantages .",
    "we have benchmarked upic - emma by comparing the 2d and 3d simulation results of lwfa in lorentz boosted frames with the corresponding osiris @xcite lab frame simulations .",
    "good agreement is found between the osiris lab frame simulations , and upic - emma boosted frame simulations , in both linear , and nonlinear regimes .",
    "we also compare upic - emma simulations for different values of @xmath2 and excellent agreement is found .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : numinstab ] we discuss the numerical instability induced by relativistic drift . in section [",
    "sect : spectralpic ] , we describe the development of upic - emma , and how using the algorithms in upic - emma can eliminate the instability induced by relativistic plasma drift . in section [ sect : lwfaboostedframesim ] , we discuss details of lwfa lorentz boosted frame simulations using upic - emma . in section [",
    "sect : lwfasim ] , we benchmark upic - emma results with different @xmath2 and with osiris lab frame simulation . summary is given in section [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "the numerical cerenkov instability induced by relativistic plasma drift has been extensively studied in @xcite . in a pic system ,",
    "when the plasma is drifting relativistically , the velocity of the drifting particles can be equal ( be in resonance ) to the component of the phase velocity of the main em mode along the drift direction .",
    "in addition , its aliased modes can always be in resonance with the em modes .",
    "the resulting wave - particle resonance leads to a violent numerical instability known as the numerical cerenkov instability . due to the nature of wave - particle resonances ,",
    "the numerical instability occurs at the intersections of the beam resonances and em modes determined by the maxwell solver used in the simulation . by carefully choosing the maxwell solver ,",
    "the instability pattern can be manipulated so that mitigation can be achieved . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "when a spectral solver is used , there are no intersections of the em modes with the main beam resonance . as a result",
    ", the instability can be found only at the aliased resonances and the fatest growing modes are the first spatial aliases .",
    "these resonances reside at high @xmath7 in fourier space far away from the important physics .",
    "the instability pattern for the spectral solver can be found by investigating the corresponding dispersion relation , @xmath11 ^ 2-[\\vec{k}]_e\\cdot[\\vec{k}]_b+[\\vec{k}]_e[\\vec{k}]_b)\\vec{e}\\nonumber\\\\ = ~&-\\omega^2_p \\sum_{\\mu,\\vec{\\nu}}(-1)^\\mu\\biggl\\{\\int \\frac{\\overleftrightarrow{s_j}(-\\vec{k}')\\vec{p}d\\vec{p}}{\\gamma\\omega'-\\vec{k}'\\cdot\\vec{p } } \\biggl\\{[\\omega]\\overleftrightarrow{s_e}(\\omega',\\vec{k}')\\vec{e}+ \\frac{\\vec{p}}{\\gamma}\\times\\{\\overleftrightarrow{s_b}(\\omega',\\vec{k}')([\\vec{k}]_e\\times\\vec{e})\\ } \\biggr\\}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f^n_0}{\\partial \\vec{p}}\\biggr\\}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath8 are the frequency and wavenumber of the modes in the simulation system ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the momentum and lorentz factor of the drifting plasma ; @xmath15 is the electric field ; @xmath16 is the normalized distribution function of the plasma ; @xmath17 is the plasma frequency ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the corresponding interpolation tensors for em fields and current ; @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22_{e , b}$ ] are the finite difference time and space operators for the maxwell solver used in the algorithm . and @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the time step , and grid sizes in the simulation . the sum over @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "is attributed to the finite grid size and time step used in the simulation .",
    "specific expressions of @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 $ ] can be found in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .    since the instability pattern is found near the intersections of the em modes and beam resonance @xcite , we can obtain a simple analytical expression for the instability pattern in the limit @xmath28 ( which leads to @xmath21=\\omega$ ] ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the equation for the em dispersion curves in the spectral solver is @xmath29 and the equations for the beam resonances are @xmath30 where @xmath31 . defining @xmath32 , we can obtain the expressions for the intersections as @xmath33 note that there are no solutions for @xmath34 for the spectral solver .",
    "the lowest order terms for the instability pattern are at the @xmath35 and @xmath36 resonances . in the limit of interest @xmath37 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath38 in figure [ fig : bandfilter ] ( a ) we plot eq .",
    "( [ eq : inst11 ] ) for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "note the `` ring '' pattern of the instability , which crosses the @xmath41 axis near the point @xmath42 ; therefore this mode is located at high @xmath7 values which are far away from the region of interesting physics .",
    "therefore , the numerical cerenkov instability can be effectively eliminated if the fatest growing modes ( @xmath43 ) are suppressed in the maxwell solver .    in the simulations ,",
    "we identify the unstable modes in fourier space using the approximate expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : inst11 ] ) .",
    "we then apply filters with specific masks which multiply the undesired modes by zero . in figure",
    "[ fig : bandfilter ] ( b ) we plot the `` ring - shaped '' band - pass filter used in some of the two - dimensional simulations for testing the instability mitigation .",

    "we also used a low pass filter with a hard cut - off .",
    "we filled the simulation box with neutral plasma drifting relativistically at @xmath44 in the @xmath45 direction , and ran cases without a filter , with the `` ring '' filter , and the low pass filter with a hard cutoff .",
    "as seen from figure [ fig : bandfilter ] ( c ) , these filters efficiently suppresses the instability modes at @xmath43 in @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mitigation of the instability using band - pass filters shows the flexibility and efficiency of a spectral solver in being able to pinpoint the suppression of the unphysical modes in pic simulations while leaving the modes near the interesting physics completely unaffected .",

    "as mentioned in the section [ sect : numinstab ] , an em - pic code with a spectral solver has superior properties in suppressing the numerical cerenkov instability induced by a relativistic plasma drift",
    ". they also have superior properties with respect to numerical dispersion errors and noise . in the following",
    ", we will briefly explain the algorithm of a spectral em - pic code , as well as discuss the challenges in optimizing the performances of such a code .",
    "spectral pic codes have a long history @xcite . however , despite their advantages in better accuracy and less noise , they are not currently as widely used because they use global field solvers which do not scale as well on parallel computers , and implementing boundary conditions is not as straight forward .",
    "a spectral em - pic code has the same basic flow chart as a finite - difference - time - domain ( fdtd ) pic code . in a spectral em - pic code",
    "both the charge and current are deposited on the mesh from the particles ; the forces exerted on the particles are interpolated from the mesh points , and particles are advanced using the lorentz forces .",
    "the main difference between the spectral pic code and fdtd pic code is the solver used to advance the electromagnetic field and that all field quantities , including the charge and current densities , are defined at the same locations on a cell ( no yee mesh @xcite is needed ) . in a spectral pic code",
    "the charge and current are directly deposited , and a strict charge conserving current deposit is not needed because gauss s law is solved at each time step using the charge density .",
    "this gives the longitudinal part of the electric field .",
    "the longitudinal component of the magnetic field is set to zero at each time step .",
    "faraday s law and ampere s law are used to advance the transverse electric and magnetic fields forward in time . note that because gauss s law is solved for directly at each time step , a charge conserving current deposit or boris correction to the longitudinal component of the electric field is not required to maintain that gauss s law is satisfied . the equation for the longitudinal component of electric field @xmath48 becomes : @xmath49 and the transverse electric field and magnetic field are leap - frogged forward in time using faraday s and ampere s law : @xmath50 where the transverse component of the current is : @xmath51 we also multiply @xmath52 and @xmath53 by a shape function @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the particle size .",
    "the fields are also multiplied by this shape function then interpolated to the particles @xcite .",
    "in addition , just as in a fdtd code , the particle positions and velocities ( and correspondingly the charge and current densities ) are defined at half integer values in time with respect to each other .",
    "if positions are defined at whole time steps and velocities ( momentum ) at half integer values , then the longitudinal and transverse components of the electric field are defined at whole time steps ( when particle positions are defined ) and the magnetic field is defined at half - integer values .",
    "once the fields are transformed back from @xmath9 space to real space then the particles can be pushed .",
    "the particle push is identical to that of a fdtd except for the interpolation of the forces because all field quantities are defined at the same locations in a cell .",
    "there are no dispersion errors for light waves due to the grid , however there are errors from the time step .",
    "this is a significant advantage of the spectral solver , whereas a fdtd code describes the @xmath56_i$ ] operator to @xmath57 , the spectral code has no errors in the @xmath22 $ ] operator .",
    "both a spectral and a fdtd code effectively truncate the highest @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , when including time step errors , the numerical dispersion of a spectral pic code is superluminal , while that of the fdtd code is subluminal . a pseudo - spectral algorithm which also removes the time step errors",
    "has recently been described @xcite . as we discuss elsewhere in this paper ,",
    "the more accurate and superluminal aspect of the em dispersion relation provided by the spectral solver ( together with the simple filters ) is crucial for eliminating the fastest growing modes of numerical cerenkov instability .",
    "this ensures no non - physical interaction between waves and particles in the first brillouin zone for the spectral pic code .",
    "the corresponding courant condition in 2d and 3d are ( for the square and cubic cells ) @xcite : @xmath60    a spectral pic code is also distinguished from a fdtd code in the way it is parallelized . for the field solver ,",
    "the simulation box is usually partitioned in one dimension in 2d , and two dimensions in 3d , so that each processor holds global information in the dimension to be transformed . as a result",
    ", a parallel spectral pic code requires a fast parallel transpose routine to accomplish efficient fft in multi - dimensions .",
    "the nature of all - to - all communications in the fft routines makes it challenging for spectral pic code to scale to large number of processors @xcite . in many cases",
    "the decomposition for the particles is the same as that for the fields although this does not have to be the case .",
    "we have developed a multi - dimensional em - pic code using a spectral field solver called upic - emma .",
    "this code was rapidly put together using components provided by the upic framework , a pic framework with spectral solvers developed at ucla @xcite .",
    "upic - emma is fully relativistic and fully parallelized .",
    "inherited from the upic framework , upic - emma is coded in layers for convenient extension with different programming styles .",
    "the lowest layers are written in fortran77 for high performance .",
    "they can be easily extended to many other languages . on top of this layer",
    "exists a library of fortran90 wrapper functions which hide the complexity of the fortran77 layer and that provide simpler arguments which enables strict type checking .",
    "the code separates the physics procedures from the communication , and utilizes the message - passing interface ( mpi ) for parallel processing .",
    "in addition , a multi - tasking library was implemented to enable mixed multi - tasking and mpi messaging , where multi - tasking is used on a multiple cpu shared memory node , and message - passing is used between such nodes .",
    "upic - emma also features 3d load balancing where the fields and particles use different partitions .",
    "in section [ sect : numinstab ] we described general issues regarding numerical instability that arises when a plasma drifts near the speed of light . in this section",
    "we describe some details regarding issues specific to modeling lwfa in a lorentz boosted frame .",
    "we describe issues related to numerical dispersion in the lab frame , in the boosted frame , and in transforming from the boosted frame back to the lab frame for comparison .",
    "we also discuss the moving antenna and interactions between the laser and the drifting plasma boundary .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one of the first obstacles in modeling lwfa in a boosted frame is to mitigate the numerical cerenkov instability . for the fdtd pic code @xcite which uses a combination of a yee solver together with the momentum conserving field interpolation scheme , it is useful to choose the optimal time step @xmath61 , where @xmath62-direction is the plasma drifting direction , to minimize the numerical cerenkov instability growth rate .",
    "the need to use this time step eliminates the flexibility in tuning the time step to minimize numerical dispersion errors for the laser . in figure",
    "[ fig : groupvelocityerror ] we present the error in group velocity of an em wave on a grid in 2d ( we let @xmath63 ) .",
    "note that for the yee , and karkkainen solvers @xcite which were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most accurate dispersion relation occurs at their courant limit , but not the corresponding optimal time step at @xmath61 ( for momentum conserving field interpolation ) . on the other hand , for a spectral pic code the instability mitigation does not rely on the relation of grid sizes and time step . in particular , the em dispersion relation can be made arbitrarily accurate by reducing the time step [ see figure [ fig : reflection ] ( a ) ] .",
    "therefore , in general when simulating relativistically drifting plasma , a spectral pic code can provide more accuracy and flexibility over the fdtd pic code with respect to numerical dispersion in the simulated frame .",
    "note that recently in ref .",
    "@xcite a pseudo - spectral algorithm is described which can further improve the accuracy .",
    "of the 2d em dispersion relation for various cases . defining @xmath64 to be the laser propagating direction , this plot shows the propagation angle in @xmath65 . if the error @xmath66 is larger than zero , its corresponding point is in the right side of the vertical axis , and vice versa .",
    "the group velocity is calculated for the @xmath67 mode while we are using @xmath68 for the calculation.,scaledwidth=104.0% ]      while numerical dispersion errors exist when using a finite size grid in vacuum , here we show that when modeling the lwfa in the lorentz boosted frame , these errors in the boosted frame are not necessarily an issue when the results are transformed back to the lab frame . while the value for @xmath2 in the boosted frame can be arbitrary , the speed up is generally larger as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "however , choosing @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the phase velocity of the wake , is generally optimum because in this frame the plasma length and the laser pulse length are nearly matched .",
    "when the laser and plasma frequency are comparable each is resolved similarly , i.e. , there is no over - resolution of either the laser wavelength or plasma wavelength . in the boosted frame ,",
    "the length of the plasma contracts by @xmath2 , the electron and ion mass are both @xmath2 times heavier , the plasma density is @xmath2 times larger , and the corresponding plasma frequency is a lorentz invariant . as for the laser , there is a @xmath71 stretch to the pulse length , while the rayleigh length contracts by @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , while the pulse waist does not change , the effective spot size at the rear of the pulse increases by a factor of @xmath72 . hence for sufficiently large @xmath2 an antenna is needed to launch the laser from the laser pulse waist that is moving backwards .",
    "the antenna is usually placed at the plasma boundary ( see section [ sect : antenna ] for details ) .    in the lab frame simulation , a moving window which only models the region of interest around the laser",
    "is often used to reduce the simulation box size .",
    "implementation of a moving window is challenging in a spectral pic code due to the non - local nature of the field solver which necessitates knowledge of boundary condition at both of the moving boundaries .",
    "however , the relative range of @xmath45 and @xmath73 contracts when lorentz transforming the data of interest from lab frame to boosted frame .",
    "if @xmath2 is appropriately chosen , in this frame the length of the plasma column is of the same order as the laser pulse length . as a result , for @xmath74",
    "it is feasible to conduct the boosted frame simulation without the moving window .    in lwfa lab frame simulations ,",
    "an em wave with frequency @xmath75 is incident on a stationary plasma slab .",
    "this leads to a reflected and transmitted waves , each having the incident frequency .",
    "their wave numbers are determined from the dispersion relation in vacuum ( reflected wave ) , and in plasma ( transmitted wave ) . in a simulation",
    "the same physics occurs except the em wave now satisfies the numerical dispersion relation in vacuum and plasma . in the boosted frame",
    "there is still a reflected and transmitted waves , except in this case the incident wave , reflected wave , and transmitted wave each have different frequencies .",
    "furthermore , numerical issues can lead to some subtle effects .",
    "an effective method to identify the frequencies of the reflected and transmitted waves is to use an @xmath76 diagram , which was previously used in studying the radiation generated from ionization fronts @xcite . at the plasma boundary @xmath77 , the phase of each wave @xmath78 must be the same , otherwise the continuity of fields can not be satisfied at every instant in time .",
    "this leads to @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath73 correspond to incident , reflected , and transmitted waves respectively .",
    "for example , if @xmath82 then @xmath83 . if the incident and reflected waves obey the vacuum dispersion relation @xmath84 then @xmath85 which can also be obtained from a double lorentz transformation . in a lorentz boosted frame",
    "the plasma is drifting but @xmath86 is lorentz transformed to @xmath87 and we want @xmath88 and @xmath89 [ where the @xmath90 sign refers to the boosted frame variables ] . in this frame",
    "@xmath91 where @xmath92 can be either the reflected or transmitted waves .",
    "the constant @xmath93 is obtained by lorentz transforming @xmath75 and @xmath94 into the boosted frame : @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , @xmath97 regardless of the relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath94 . in a real system",
    "@xmath98 although numerical errors in the dispersion relation do not alter the constant @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the reflected and transmitted waves must fall along the line @xmath100 in @xmath101 space ( here we are ignoring the aliasing modes ) .",
    "in addition , they must also fall on the dispersion curves for light in a plasma @xcite @xmath102 ^ 2=[k]^2+\\frac{\\omega'^2_p}{\\gamma_b}s^2\\frac{[\\omega]-[k]v_b}{\\omega - kv_b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or in vacuum @xmath103 ^ 2=[k]^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the grid where we assume @xmath104 in eq .",

    "the line @xmath112 and the dispersion curve for a real plasma ( black dashed lines ) , a fdtd yee solver ( red lines ) , and a spectral solver ( green lines for inside the plasma ; magenta lines for in vacuum ) are shown .",
    "the vacuum dispersion relation is plotted for the spectral solver in the upper left quadrant for the reasons given in the next paragraph . in figure",
    "[ fig : reflection ] ( b ) , we have expanded the region in @xmath76 space near the origin to illustrate the frequency and direction of the transmitted wave which does not depend strongly on the solvers used .",
    "when @xmath113 then @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath116 then @xmath117 would be negative and the phase velocity and group velocity of the transmitted wave would be negative ; however , since @xmath118 the transmitted wave would still be in the plasma .",
    "figure [ fig : reflection ] ( a ) also illustrates that numerical errors to the dispersion relation effect the location of the reflected wave . in a real system",
    "where @xmath119 in vacuum and @xmath120 in the plasma , then the reflected wave would occur where @xmath121 intersects the vacuum curve , i.e. at @xmath122 , which is larger than the largest @xmath92 in the fundamental brillouin zone . however , for the numerical dispersion curves shown in figure [ fig : reflection ] ( a ) , the reflected wave resides at the intersection with the plasma dispersion relation in the lower right quadrant for the fdtd solver or with the vacuum dispersion relation in the upper left quadrant for the spectral solver .",
    "for the fdtd case , the reflected wave has a negative phase and group velocity .",
    "however , the group velocity is less than @xmath0 so the reflected wave propagates backwards while staying inside the plasma . for the spectral solver the group velocity is slightly larger than the speed of light",
    "so it resides outside the plasma .",
    "the predicted locations of the transmitted and reflected waves are confirmed in an osiris ( fdtd ) simulation .",
    "this is seen in figure [ fig : reflection ] ( c ) , in which the @xmath92 and @xmath123 spectrum is plotted from a simulation for parameters identical to those used to generate the theoretical plot in figure [ fig : reflection ] ( a ) .",
    "strong signals are seen at the predicted locations . for cases of interest",
    "the reflection coefficient is small [ the reflected signal is significantly smaller than the transmitted signal in figure [ fig : reflection ] ( c ) ] so the unphysical mode is not energetically important , and it does not complicate the physics .",
    "we have also investigated the invariance of transforming results back to the lab frame based on the numerical dispersion relations .",
    "we note that solving maxwell s equations on a grid using discrete time steps is not strictly lorentz invariant .",
    "for example , the group velocity of light in vacuum for a spectral solver is greater than the speed of light , and it depends on @xmath124 .",
    "nevertheless , when carrying out lwfa ( or other ) simulations in a boosted frame , the results are transformed back to the lab frame using the lorentz transformations .",
    "this is assumed to be reasonable if one is looking at modes which are properly resolved .    as noted earlier ,",
    "when @xmath2 is chosen near @xmath70 there is a balance between the laser pulse length and the plasma length .",
    "in addition , for @xmath125 the transmitted wave @xmath126 , and errors in the boosted frame due to the finite cell size are minimized . in figure",
    "[ fig : reflection ] ( d ) we show that when @xmath127 and @xmath128 for the transmitted wave are lorentz transformed back to the lab frame using the velocity addition formulas , @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the phase and group velocity normalized to @xmath132 , that the numerical errors are nearly absent for sufficiently large @xmath2 .",
