    "one of the fascinating aspects of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics is the universality that characterizes the behavior of thermodynamic functions close to a second order phase transition @xcite .",

    "existing studies of quantum phase transitions in @xmath9 dimensions are usually either based on mapping to well - known critical models that can be performed by employing conformal field theory , and/or analyzed with full numerical simulations @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we introduce a dimensionless parameter @xmath12 , which quantifies the strength of quantum fluctuations .",

    "is increased from zero . in this section",
    "we calculate @xmath37 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "we first obtain a crude result using naive scaling and then obtain a more accurate result with the help of the renormalization group ( rg ) , using wilson s momentum shell integration @xcite .",
    "this is a standard problem of crossover @xcite , but our problem is simple enough that it can be analyzed in more detail .",
    "for any space - time dimensionality @xmath10 , the model in eq . has a fixed point at @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this fixed point leads to scaling that is mean - field in nature . to see this , consider a generalization of the model to include high order anharmonicities , such as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc , which were implicitly ignored in eq . and which are present in realistic systems ( _ e.g. _  for chains of interacting particles @xcite ) : @xmath42\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath43 , the partition function can be evaluated using a saddle - point approximation .",
    "then , the phase transition occurs at @xmath39 , and near the phase transition the value of the order parameter is small , of order @xmath44 , such that high anharmonicities such as @xmath40 and higher can be neglected ( provided that @xmath23 ) .",

    "therefore , for small but positive @xmath12 ( and @xmath23 ) , it is sufficient to consider quartic anharmonicities only , as done in eq .   and through the rest of this paper .",
    "this is in contrast with scaling near the tricritical point , where the quartic term strictly vanishes and one must keep the sixth order term @xcite .    for positive @xmath12 , fluctuations tend to extend the size of the disordered phase , thus shifting the phase transition to positive values of @xmath47 .",
    "provided @xmath48 the resulting fixed point is in the ising universality class .",
    "however , for small @xmath12 the shape of the phase transition line , @xmath37 , is expected to be controlled by scaling near the mean - field fixed point at @xmath49 .",
    "we will use this fact to first give a naive derivation of @xmath37 and then improve on this estimate using the rg .",
    "we proceed with a simple analysis based on spatial rescaling . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the scaling factor @xmath50 and perform the following rescaling of the space - time coordinate @xmath24 as @xmath51 which leads to the rescaling of the correlation length @xmath52 using the critical scaling of the correlation length @xmath53 and of the order parameter @xmath19 near the mean - field fixed point at @xmath16 and @xmath39 , @xmath54 one obtains @xmath55 where the second equality directly follows from the first .",

    "this can be summarized by rescaling the effective @xmath12 , @xmath60 and shows that , by continuing the process , one moves farther away from the mean - field critical point .",
    "( as a side remark , note that @xmath61 is a marginal case of the rescaling and that for @xmath62 quantum fluctuations become irrelevant . )    let us consider a reference point @xmath63 lying on the phase transition line .",

    "this is expected not to affect any universal properties arising from the infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "the critical value @xmath28 is then found by setting @xmath74 .",
