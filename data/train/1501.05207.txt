    "most galaxies are thought to harbor supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses from @xmath1 to @xmath2 at their centers @xcite .",
    "this is inferred from observing proper motions of stars bound to the smbhs @xcite , measuring stellar velocity dispersions around smbhs @xcite or detecting radiation emitted from gas accreting onto the smbhs @xcite . in the last of these signatures ,",
    "continuous accretion from a gas reservoir in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) produces intense radiation and powerful outflows and jets . on the other hand ,",
    "gas accretion proceeds quiescently , at a significantly lower rate , in the centers of inactive galaxies .",
    "the gas poor environment surrounding these smbhs is not accompanied by significant emission @xcite .",
    "tidal disruption events ( tdes ) provide a distinctive opportunity to probe dormant smbhs at the centres of such inactive galaxies .",
    "most tdes take place when a star at large separation ( @xmath3 ) is perturbed onto a parabolic orbit approaching close enough to the smbh to be ripped apart by the tidal forces , at the radius @xmath4 . here",
    "we denote smbh mass with @xmath5 , stellar mass with @xmath6 and radius with @xmath7 , and the schwarzschild radius with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are newton s constant and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the subsequent accretion of stellar debris falling back to the smbh produces a characteristic flare with a luminosity large enough to exceed the eddington luminosity for a time scale of weeks to month @xcite .",
    "recent observations of swift j164449.3 + 573451 showed that relativistic jets are associated with some fraction of tdes @xcite .",
    "candidates for tdes have also been observed at x - ray , ultraviolet , and optical wavebands @xcite , with inferred event rates of @xmath11 per year per galaxy @xcite , although the observed light curves and spectra @xcite do not always match the simplest theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "black hole spin is one of two fundamental quantities characterizing astrophysical black holes , which inevitably acquire spin angular momentum as a result of standard mass accretion or chaotic accretion @xcite .",
    "measuring black hole spins has proven much more difficult than black hole mass estimation , because the dynamical effects of spin occur much closer to the event horizon . since an accretion disk can get closer to the black hole when the black hole is spinning @xcite , a detailed spectral analysis of disk x - ray emission",
    "can determine the black hole spin @xcite .",
    "such indirect spin measurements have been so far made for about @xmath12 smbhs @xcite , and recently indicated that the smbh at the centre of the nearby galaxy ngc 1365 has at least @xmath13 of the maximum theoretically allowed value @xcite .",
    "smbh spins are difficult to measure , but are of significant astrophysical importance .",
    "spin amplitude and direction significantly affect the efficiency for converting rest mass energy into radiation . while the mass - to - energy conversion efficiency reaches @xmath14 for an extreme kerr black hole in a prograde rotation , it is only @xmath15 for the retrograde case @xcite , suggesting a wide range of bolometric disk luminosities depending on the relative inclination of disk and smbh spin .",
    "a smbh - disk system can also work as an engine to convert the black hole s rotational energy into outflows and jets @xcite .",
    "the outflow efficiency depends on spin magnitude and direction via a large - scale magnetic flux threading the black hole and the disk @xcite .",
    "it is still theoretically uncertain whether such jets will align with the black hole spin axis , with the angular momentum vector of the accretion disk , or with some other aspect of the magnetic field geometry @xcite . a misaligned accretion disk will undergo differential precession due to lense - thirring frame dragging . while a geometrically thin disk warps by the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite , a geometrically thick disk can precess as a rigid - body rotator , as has been seen in general relativistic magneto - hydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "very recent grmhd simulations have also shown that a highly magnetized geometrically thick disk can warp due to electromagnetic torques @xcite .",
    "the present spin of a smbh records the history of gas accretion and mergers with other black holes , and statistical samples of smbh spins encode valuable information on the growth history of smbhs in the universe @xcite .",
    "the smbhs in most agn are thought to have accreted sufficient gas in their active phase to be rotating near the extreme kerr limit @xcite , although events of randomly oriented gas clump accretion might be able to produce black holes that rotate much more slowly .",
    "in contrast to generally aligned prograde accretion in agn , spinning smbhs undergoing tdes can rotate either retrograde or prograde with respect to inflowing gas , with a full range of possible inclinations for the transient accretion disk .",
    "tdes therefore act as natural laboratories for testing theories about accretion and jet launching physics over a full range of prograde and retrograde inclination angles .",
    "our simulations have focused primarily on tidal disruption of stars with eccentric , rather than parabolic @xcite , centre of mass trajectories .",
    "although the standard two - body scattering mechanism for generating tdes @xcite predicts effectively parabolic trajectories ( @xmath16 ) , other mechanisms can feed stars to smbhs at lower eccentricities . among these non - standard sources of tdes ,",
    "the most promising are binary smbhs , a recoil accompanying a smbh merger , and the tidal separation of binary stars .",
    "recent numerical simulations have shown that observable properties of these `` eccentric '' tdes significantly deviate from those of standard tdes ; in particular , the rate of mass return is substantially increased by being cut off at a finite time , rather than continuing indefinitely as a power law decay @xcite .",
    "because of their naturally limited dynamic range , simulations of eccentric tidal disruption were the first to capture relativistic circularization of debris around smbhs , which is extremely computationally challenging for the canonical parabolic case .",
    "these simulations found that circularization is driven by general relativistic pericentre shift , which causes shocks to form at stream self - intersections .",
    "the orbital energy dissipated at these self - intersections subsequently circularizes the debris into a more compact accretion disk @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to past newtonian simulations of circularization for parabolic orbits around intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath17 ) , where purely hydrodynamic effects circularize tidally stretched debris @xcite ; although these are expected to be ineffective for smbh - like mass ratios @xcite .",
    "the primary motivation for this work is to investigate the effect of smbh spin on debris circularization .",
    "we test the hypothesis that nodal precession due to the lense - thirring effect can delay the onset of stream self - intersections and strongly retard formation of a luminous accretion disk @xcite .",
    "if proven true , tde circularization delays could be used as probes of smbh spin .",
    "such delays could also decrease the average luminosity of many tdes ; if spin - induced circularization delay is common but not universal , it would produce a bimodality in tde optical emission that could explain a discrepancy between theoretically predicted and observationally inferred tde rates @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the circularization of a tidally disrupted star on an eccentric orbit around a spinning smbh . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we describe our numerical approach , focusing on the post - newtonian corrections we make use of . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we examine the results of our numerical simulations in two limiting regimes : one is the radiatively efficient cooling case , in which the photon diffusion time is much shorter than the energy dissipation timescale . in the opposite scenario , where the radiative cooling is inefficient , the debris circularization proceeds in a qualitatively different way . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we examine the effect of black hole spin on debris circularization , and the nodal precession of the newly formed accretion disk by the lense - thirring effect .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : sum ] is devoted to summary and discussion of our scenario .",
    "we start by describing our numerical methods , with a special focus on how to treat relativistic effects in the numerical code , and summarize the setup of our physical and numerical models .",
    "first , we describe our procedures for numerically modeling the tidal disruption of stars on bound orbits .",
    "the simulations presented below were performed with a three - dimensional ( 3d ) smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code , which is a particle method that divides the fluid into a set of particles , and is flexible in setting various initial configurations .",
    "the code is based on a version originally developed by @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "the sph equations are composed of a mass conservation equation , a momentum equation with the sph standard artificial viscosity , and an energy equation . their details will be described later , in section  [ sec : relasph ] .",
    "these equations , with the standard cubic - spline kernel , are integrated using a second - order runge - kutta - fehlberg integrator with individual time steps for each particle and a variable smoothing length @xcite , resulting in enormous computational savings when a large range of dynamical timescales are involved .",
    "the variable smoothing length scheme we used gives appropriate spatial resolution in our code , but we ignore the term proportional to the gradient of the smoothing length .",
    "this term is introduced for calculating the gradient of fluid properties when the smoothing length is varied in space and time , and is important for ensuring energy conservation if the gradient of any physical quantities varies over a shorter scale than the smoothing length ( see @xcite for a review ) . in our simulations ,",
    "the specific energy is well conserved for all the models .",
    "this shows that the term plays no crucial role in our simulations .",
    "we have performed 3d sph simulations self - consistently modeling a star from before its entry into the tidal sphere up to late times , when the stellar debris has circularized into a disk .",
    "we model general relativistic effects , including leading order smbh spin corrections , by incorporating post - newtonian ( pn ) forces up to 2pn into the sph code .",
    "we have run ten pairs of simulations of tidal disruption events with different parameters .",
    "the common parameters through all of simulations are following : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and a unit of run time @xmath22 .",
    "the total number of sph particles used in each simulation is @xmath23k , where k=1000 .",
    "we also adopt the standard value of the artificial viscosity parameters : @xmath24 and @xmath25 through all the simulations .",
    "table 1 summarizes each model .",
    "models  1 - 4 show the eccentric tdes around non - spinning smbhs with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "models  5 and 6 have the same simulation parameters as model  4 , except that the black hole is spinning with spin parameters @xmath30 for model 5 and @xmath31 for model 6 .",
    "both models have an inclination angle @xmath32 between the spin angular momentum and the axis perpendicular to the orbital plane of the stellar debris .",
    "models 7 and 8 have the same parameters as model 6 but for @xmath33 for model 7 and @xmath34 for model 8 , respectively .",
    "model 9 has the same parameters as model 8 but for @xmath30 .",
    "model 10 has the same simulation parameters as model 1 but for @xmath35 , and has been performed to compare with model 2a of @xcite ( see section  [ sec33 ] ) .",
    "each of these ten sets of simulation parameters has been run twice , with two different equations of state ( adiabatic and polytropic , discussed in more detail in section  [ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "the formalism of post - newtonian ( pn ) hydrodynamics was constructed by @xcite for the approximate treatment of relativistic effects in a non - covariant framework .",
    "their formalism is applicable to a moderately relativistic self - gravitating fluid ( with gravitational radiation reaction , if desired ) , so long as the pn parameter @xmath36 ( for a typical spatial scale @xmath37 ) never exceeds @xmath38 .",
    "it is not , however , simple to implement this formalism into existing newtonian sph codes .    for a typical tde with an orbital speed @xmath39",
    ", the pn parameter is estimated to be @xmath40 at the tidal disruption radius .",
    "the magnitude of the self - gravitating potential and thermal energy of the star can be similarly parameterized to be @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the sound speed ( for a stellar temperature @xmath44 ) , respectively .",
    "these order of magnitude estimates show that even the lowest pn order terms for stellar self - gravitation and thermal energy can be self - consistently neglected , even if up to 2pn precision in the black hole s gravity is desired .",
    "because we only need to modify the smbh potential , and can continue to treat hydrodynamics and gas self - gravity in a newtonian fashion , it becomes much simpler to implement the pn formalism into our sph code .    in order to treat approximately relativistic effects such as pericentre shift and spin - induced precession , we have incorporated acceleration terms corrected by the post - newtonian approximations into the momentum equation of sph particles .",
    "the detailed formulae can be seen in appendix a.      we have performed two - stage simulations : a star is first modeled as a polytropic gas sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium . the tidal disruption process is then simulated by setting the star in motion through the gravitational field of a black hole . in our simulations ,",
    "the black hole is represented by a sink particle with the appropriate gravitational mass @xmath5 .",
    "all gas particles that fall within a specified accretion radius are accreted by the sink particle .",
    "we set the accretion radius of the black hole as the radius of the marginally stable orbit for the non - spinning black hole @xcite : @xmath45 , in all the models .",
    "the initial position and velocity of the star is given by that of a test particle orbiting around the black hole .",
    "in the test - particle limit , the specific energy and angular momentum with pn corrections are given from equations ( [ eq : spece ] ) and ( [ eq : specj ] ) by @xmath46 where the index @xmath47 refers to a given sph particle , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the position and velocity vector of the black hole particle , respectively .",
    "this energy and angular momentum should approximately equal their respective newtonian analogues at a distance far away from the black hole .",

    "this is because retrograde spin increases the apsidal shift per orbit , while prograde spin decreases it .",
    "increased apsidal precession both reduces the time it takes for the debris head to catch its tail ( increasing circularization rates for eccentric tdes ) and increases the relative velocity at the stream self - intersection point ( increasing circularization rates for both eccentric and parabolic tdes ) .",

    "the circularization efficiency can become very low when this radius is comparable to the stream apocentre .",
    "the greater uncertainty in extrapolating our results to the parabolic limit is the structure of the streams , which depends sensitively on internal self - gravity and cooling physics .",
    "modeling stream structure in parabolic tdes goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , our two extreme cooling regimes have outlined the relevant parameter space : if the stream structure is comparable to or thinner than that in our constant - entropy simulations , then debris circularization will depend sensitively on smbh spin .",

    "the upper limit of the precursor luminosity can be comparable to the eddington luminosity .",
    "a similar idea was proposed by equation ( 8) of @xcite in the context of tidal disruption of a red giant star on a parabolic orbit .",
    "however , it is important to evaluate whether the energy dissipated by shocks can actually be radiated away within a fallback time . if this is not the case , then any precursor signal from circularization luminosity will be strongly suppressed as with our radiatively inefficient cooling simulations .",
    "we have found that the dissipated energy will be efficiently radiated away for black holes above a critical mass : @xmath209 for electron scattering opacity .",

    "<S> we study the circularization of tidally disrupted stars on bound orbits around spinning supermassive black holes by performing three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations with post - newtonian corrections . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the efficiency of radiative cooling . </S>",
    "<S> there are two stages in debris circularization if radiative cooling is inefficient : first , the stellar debris streams self - intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession ; shocks at the intersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a geometrically thick , ring - like structure around the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the ring rapidly spreads via viscous diffusion , leading to the formation of a geometrically thick accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if radiative cooling is efficient , the stellar debris circularizes due to self - intersection shocks and forms a geometrically thin ring - like structure . in this case , the dissipated energy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the subsequent tidal disruption flare . </S>",
    "<S> the circularization timescale is remarkably long in the radiatively efficient cooling case , and is also sensitive to black hole spin . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , lense - thirring torques cause dynamically important nodal precession , which significantly delays debris circularization . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in the radiatively inefficient case . </S>",
    "<S> since the stellar debris is optically thick and its photon diffusion time is likely longer than the timescale of shock heating , our inefficient cooling scenario is more generally applicable in eccentric tidal disruption events ( tdes ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in parabolic tdes for @xmath0 , the spin - sensitive behavior associated with efficient cooling may be realized .    </S>",
