    "although spatio - temporal pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature , there are relatively few systems which are amenable to both accurate experimental study and first - principles weakly nonlinear analysis.@xcite the classic examples involving fluid mechanical instabilities are rayleigh - bnard convection and taylor - couette flow .",
    "the results of perturbation theory based on the navier - stokes and heat equations are in good agreement with high precision experiments in the weakly nonlinear regime of these two instabilities.@xcite a more complex example is electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals due to the carr - helfrich mechanism.@xcite here , remarkably good agreement has been achieved in spite of the complexity of the problem . however , in other cases either the materials can not be sufficiently characterized or the underlying physical equations are not understood well enough to allow quantitative comparisons between observations and theory .",
    "electroconvection in suspended smectic films is a promising new experimental system for quantitative studies of spatio - temporal pattern formation.@xcite when a thin , suspended film of smectic liquid crystal is subjected to a sufficient potential difference , a charge separation arises which drives the film into convection .",
    "the flow pattern just above onset is sustained by the electric field acting on charges which develop near the free surfaces of the film .",
    "these charges are simply a consequence of the electrostatic boundary conditions which must be satisfied by the fields inside and outside of the film.@xcite fig .  [ schematic ]",
    "shows a schematic of the experimental arrangement .",
    "this source of charge is distinct from that due to the carr - helfrich mechanism which drives bulk electroconvection in certain nematics.@xcite in that case , the charge generation mechanism involves an essential coupling to the director orientation . in experiments on smectic  a liquid crystal films@xcite , in which the director was perpendicular to the film , no orientational effects",
    "were observed , indicating that the flow remained isotropic in the film plane .",
    "recent experiments on smectic c films@xcite showed convection and flow alignment of the projection of the director in the plane of the film , but were not consistent with the carr - helfrich mechanism .",
    "these were likely driven by the mechanism discussed here , with the flow alignment a secondary effect .",
    "it has , however , been hypothesized@xcite that the two mechanisms might coexist in some smectic c materials .",
    "the mechanism we discuss here is presumably also responsible for convection observed in thin , suspended films of isotropic fluids and in nematics in certain regimes@xcite .",
    "these cases involve substantial three - dimensional effects , however , because they lack the smectic layering which has the effect of restricting the flow to the film plane . in what follows",
    ", we consider only very thin isotropic films , relevant to the case of smectic  a , on which most of the experiments have been performed.@xcite    a theoretical model of the onset of electroconvection in suspended films was introduced by daya , morris , and de bruyn.@xcite the film was represented as a weakly conducting , two - dimensional , isotropic fluid . to find the electric fields and charge densities which drive convection , the electrostatic potential was determined .",
    "the three - dimensional electrostatic equations effectively constitute a nonlocal coupling between the in - plane fields and charge densities which appear in the two - dimensional navier - stokes and charge continuity equations .",
    "this extra coupling formally distinguishes the resulting equations from those of thermal convection in the rayleigh - bnard problem , although some interesting similarities remain .",
    "the value of the critical wavenumber from the linear stability analysis@xcite is in good agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a weakly nonlinear analysis of the electrohydrodynamic equations given in ref .",

    "although there are important physical differences between these two pattern forming instabilities , the resulting amplitude equation for both problems is of the ginzburg - landau form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the control parameter , which depends on the applied electric potential , and @xmath2 is a slowly varying amplitude .",

    "are found to be in good agreement with the values determined from the linear stability analysis of daya _ et al_.@xcite mao , de bruyn , and morris have experimentally measured all three coefficients.@xcite the experimental value of @xmath4 is in reasonable agreement with theory .",
    "quantitative comparison of @xmath3 and @xmath5 with theory is difficult at the present time due to large uncertainties in the conductivity and viscosity of the liquid crystal , which are required to non - dimensionalize the experimental results .",

    "[ ampintro ] determines the regions of control parameter - wavenumber space where the vortex pattern itself is stable.@xcite for example , one expects such a one - dimensional pattern to exhibit a long - wavelength instability due to the eckhaus mechanism@xcite which restricts the range of stable wavenumbers available to the pattern .",
    "the amplitude equation can also be used to study how the ends of a finite - length film affect the range of stable wavenumbers .",
    "this wavenumber selection mechanism was first investigated by cross , daniels , hohenberg , and siggia  @xcite in the context of rayleigh - bnard convection in finite containers .",
