    "the search for gravitational waves emitted from stellar collapse has been the major goal of many relativists and astrophysicists since the early seventies of last century . at the beginning of a new millenium ,",
    "several ground - based interferometric detectors ( e.g. ligo , virgo , geo 600 , tama 300 ) are currently endeavouring to detect gravitational waves from extraterrestrial objects ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . with the upgrade of these detectors and the availability of a space - based interferometric detector , lisa , which is expected to be launched at the beginning of the next decade",
    ", it is widely believed that gravitational wave detection and hence astronomy in the gravitational wave window will become achievable in the near future @xcite .",
    "in fact , there have been four science runs on ligo and geo 600 since 2002 . despite that",
    "so far no positive evidence for the existence of gravitational waves has been found , relevant observational data were used to place limits on the ellipticity and the gravitational wave strain of a number of known pulsars @xcite .",
    "one major kind of gravitational wave emitting astrophysical processes is certainly stellar gravitational collapse , often resulting in remnants of neutron stars or black holes , which are also possible gravitational wave emitters ( for a review on gravitational waves emitted in gravitational collapse see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for example , gravitational waves emitted in the formation of neutron stars in our galaxy via stellar core collapses have been shown to be detectable for sufficiently fierce asymmetric collapse @xcite . since",
    "such gravitational waves are likely to carry the information about the internal structure of the neutron star involved , such as its mass , radius , density distribution and in turn its equation of state ( eos ) , the characteristics of gravitational wave signals emitted from undulating neutron stars have become a subject of much study ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the spectrum of gravitational waves from compact stellar objects are commonly described in terms of quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) .",
    "each of these qnms is characterized by a complex eigenfrequency @xmath4 and has a time dependence @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the qnm frequencies of gravitational waves emitted from a neutron star are generally model - sensitive and are expected to depend significantly on the eos used in the stellar model . in spite of this fact ,",
    "some universal behaviours in the frequency @xmath6 and the damping time @xmath7 of the @xmath8-mode and the @xmath0-mode oscillations of non - rotating neutron stars can still be identified @xcite , which have recently been explained by @xcite .",
    "based on such universal behaviours , it has been shown that the radius and the mass of a neutron star can be inferred from the pulsation frequencies of its fundamental fluid @xmath8-mode and the first @xmath0-mode @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , @xcite and @xcite showed that the eos of a neutron star can be inferred from the eigenfrequencies of a few ( say , e.g. , 3 ) @xmath0-mode qnms .",
    "these discoveries all underscore the physical significance of qnms of neutron stars . on the other hand , it is important to note that detection of gravitation waves from neutron stars with sufficient accuracy to infer their internal structure is a mission impossible in the short ( or even medium ) term . as estimated by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "realisation of such schemes has to await the availability of more advanced gravitational - wave observatory like euro .",
    "non - radial oscillations of relativistic neutron stars , first studied by @xcite , can be analysed by decomposing the perturbed einstein equations into spherical harmonics .",
    "such oscillations are categorized into axial ( toroidal ) and polar ( spheroidal ) modes according to the parity of the harmonics . in axial - mode oscillations , which can be described by a single second - order wave equation @xcite , fluid elements of a star",
    "are merely spectators in the sense that they are not affected by gravitational waves generated @xcite . on the other hand , in polar - mode oscillations , fluid motion and gravitational wave",
    "are coupled together . due to the complicated interplay between the matter and the metric ,",
    "polar - mode oscillations are usually governed by a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) involving several physical variables . in the pioneering work of @xcite ,",
    "polar oscillations are described by a fifth - order system of odes .",
    "later , @xcite explicitly reduced the equation set into a fourth - order one , hereafter referred to as the ld formalism , where the oscillation of a star is described by four independent physical quantities @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath1 . while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are measures of the metric , @xmath11 and @xmath1 are respectively proportional to the lagrangian displacement in the radial direction and the pressure change of the fluid constituting the star ( see sect . 2 for more details ) . besides the scheme proposed by @xcite , there are other schemes describing polar oscillations with two coupled second - order odes @xcite",
    "they are in fact equivalent to fourth - order systems .    as in the newtonian theory of stellar pulsations",
    ", polar oscillations can be classified into the fundamental ( @xmath8 ) mode , the pressure ( @xmath12 ) mode , and the gravity ( @xmath13 ) mode .",
    "in addition to these , there is an extra kind of mode in the relativistic theory , namely the spacetime ( @xmath0 ) mode , representing mainly perturbations in the metric @xcite .",
    "soon after the discovery of the polar @xmath0-mode , it has been conjectured that the fluid in a relativistic star will not be affected much by @xmath0-mode pulsations @xcite .",
    "aiming at understanding qualitatively the physical nature of polar @xmath0-mode pulsations , @xcite suggested the inverse - cowling approximation ( ica ) for polar @xmath0-mode oscillations . in ica",
    "the fluid motion is completely neglected from the outset ( details of ica will be discussed in sect . 2 of the present paper ) and",
    "the metric variables are governed by a second - order ode system .",
    "the approximation can successfully reproduce qualitative features of polar @xmath0-mode oscillations and clarify the nature of the oscillations @xcite . however , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , it fails to reproduce accurate values of the qnm frequencies .",
    "this is a sort of expected because the main concern of ica was qualitative discussion on polar @xmath0-mode oscillations .",
    "the major objective of the present paper is to establish a quantitatively correct approximation for the polar @xmath0-mode , referred to as generalised inverse - cowling approximation ( gica ) in the present paper , which is capable of locating polar @xmath0-mode with high accuracy ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in our analysis we find that the fluid motion of a star is in fact non - negligible .",
    "however , @xmath1 is so small that the eigenfrequency of polar @xmath0-mode can be accurately determined with the approximation @xmath2 ( hereafter a prime indicates differentiation with respect to circumferential radius @xmath14 ) by solving two coupled first - order odes .",
    "thus , under gica polar @xmath0-mode oscillations are describable with one single second - order ode system .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in sect .  2",
    ", we briefly review the ld formalism .",
    "the ica developed by @xcite is discussed in sect .  3 and we propose gica in sect .  4 .",
    "we then conclude our paper in sect .  5 with a short conclusion and discussion .",
    "unless otherwise stated , geometrized units in which @xmath15 are adopted in the following discussion .",
    "in spherical coordinates , @xmath16 , the geometry of spacetime around a non - rotating unperturbed neutron star is given by the line element : @xmath17 the metric coefficient @xmath18 is determined by the mass distribution function @xmath19 , the mass inside circumferential radius @xmath14 , @xmath20 the other metric coefficient @xmath21 and the mass distribution function @xmath19 can be obtained from the solution to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath12 are the mass density and pressure , respectively .    on the other hand , in the ld formalism for a pulsating relativistic star with radius @xmath24 @xcite , the perturbation in the metric , @xmath25 , can be expressed in terms of three physical quantities @xmath26 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and displayed in a matrix form as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is eigenfrequency of the polar mode oscillation , @xmath29 is the angular momentum quantum number , and @xmath30 correspondingly , the lagrangian displacements of the fluid are expressed by : @xmath31 in other words , @xmath11 and @xmath32 together measure the spatial displacements of the fluid .    putting all these perturbations into the einstein equations",

    "working in ld formalism and motivated by the conjecture that the fluid in a relativistic star is hardly excited by @xmath0-mode pulsations @xcite , @xcite attempted to study the physical nature of polar @xmath0-mode oscillations by proposing the ica with @xmath47 . under such assumption ,",

    "this is not really surprising because the original motivation of ica was merely to verify the spacetime nature of polar @xmath0-mode oscillations .",
    "the inadequacy of the approximation @xmath47 can be clearly shown by comparing the contributions of various terms in ( [ lindblom-5 ] ) , whose physical meaning will be discussed at the end of this paper . in fig .  2 ,",

    "@xmath0-mode oscillations of neutron stars are governed by two first - order ode in the metric coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the displacements of matter , measured by @xmath32 and @xmath11 , are properly considered and found to be expressible in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . numerical results obtained directly from the approximation @xmath2",
    "clearly demonstrate the validity and accuracy of gica ( see fig .  1 and table  1 ) .",
    "in addition to yielding reliable numerical values of qnm frequencies for @xmath0-mode oscillations , gica proposed here also provides a proper physical picture for such oscillations .",
    "a star undergoing polar @xmath0-mode oscillations has non - negligible displacements in the tangential and radial directions .",
    "however , as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "such displacements are driven by the perturbed spacetime , instead of the excess pressure due to the motion of matter .",
    "it is well known that axial @xmath0-mode oscillations of compact stars , which are merely oscillations in the metric variables , are governed by a second - order regge - wheeler wave equation @xcite .",
    "our finding that polar @xmath0-mode oscillations are adequately described by one single second - order ode system thus puts polar and axial @xmath0-modes on an equal footing in the sense that both of them are governed by second - order ode systems .",
    "as shown in the review by @xcite , qnms of these two kinds of @xmath0-mode lie asymptotically on a common smooth curve in the complex frequency plane .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite also noted that for incompressible ultra compact stars the oscillation frequencies of these two @xmath0-modes agree to within one percent .",
    "gica proposed here may be the first step in the long process of seeking quantitative interpretation of such interesting asymptotic behaviour and the similarity between two kinds of @xmath0-mode .",
    "we have adopted ld formalism to describe polar oscillations in the present paper .",
    "in fact , there are other alternative formalisms for polar oscillations of relativistic stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in particular , in the formalism proposed by @xcite , and later used by @xcite to study accretion - driven gravitational waves from compact stars ,",
    "such oscillations are described by two coupled second - order wave equations in the metric variables plus a hamiltonian constraint yielding the eulerian change in the fluid pressure .",
    "the approach is also equivalent to a fourth - order differential equation system with the tortoise ordinate being the independent variable .",
    "the formalism is evidently more amenable to decoupling metric and matter variables .",
    "it is worthy to develop quantitatively accurate approximation scheme for polar @xmath0-mode oscillations based on such formalism .",
    "currently we are working along this direction .",
    "lastly , it is worthy to note the physical meaning of ( [ lindblom-5 ] ) , which can be rewritten as follows : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the eulerian change in pressure .",
    "each term in ( [ lindblom-5-new ] ) has an obvious analogue in newtonian theory of stellar pulsation ( see , e.g. eq . ( 17.21b ) in * ? ? ?",
    "the term @xmath77 in the lhs is a measure of @xmath78 , whereas the two terms in the rhs , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , correspond to the pressure and gravity forces , respectively .",
    "thus , ( [ lindblom-5-new ] ) can be understood as the extension of application of newton s second law to general relativistic theory of stellar pulsation .",
    "following directly from fig .  2 and ( [ lindblom-5-new ] ) , the net driving forces for @xmath0-mode pulsation is the sum of gravity and the eulerian change in pressure .",
    "to compare @xmath0-mode with @xmath8 and @xmath12 modes , we show in fig .  3 and fig .  4 the corresponding physical quantities appearing in ( [ lindblom-5 ] ) for the @xmath8-mode and the first @xmath12-mode of the same star",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath8-mode oscillations the major driving force is the eulerian change in pressure @xmath81 and the gravity in fact partially cancels the effect of @xmath82 . on the other hand , the major driving force for @xmath12-mode oscillations is evidently due to the lagrangian change in pressure @xmath83 .",
    "we expect that these findings can cast light on eigen - mode analysis for pulsations of relativistic stars and assist in developing appropriate approximation schemes under different circumstances .",
