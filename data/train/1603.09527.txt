    "the strengths and modest widths of these vector meson resonances suggest that vmd may be of importance to still higher energies and momentum transfers before pqcd dominates .",
    "the knowledge of the complex structure of the pion ff enables one to also make predictions concerning its phase .",
    "indeed , the phase @xmath92 of @xmath2 is defined , for timelike @xmath93 [ @xmath94 for @xmath95 , since the pion ff is real in this @xmath0 region ] , through the identity ( q^2)=|(q^2)|e^i_(q^2 ) . moreover , by invoking the watson s theorem  @xcite , experimental values of such a phase can be extracted from @xmath96 scattering phase shift data in the elastic range . + figure  [ fig : phasepi ] shows a comparison between our prediction of the pion ff phase in the four cases and a set @xmath96 phase shift data  @xcite ( solid black points ) .",
    "these data have been not considered for the fitting procedure .",
    "the quite good agreement for @xmath97 gev@xmath63 demonstrates that our parametrization , dominated in this region by the @xmath1 propagator , well reproduces the physical analyticity of the pion ff . + the kink in the model curve at @xmath98",
    "gev@xmath63 is a result of the @xmath99 interference , lying about halfway between the masses of the two mesons and in fact about one width below the @xmath100 .",
    "unfortunately , being only a few % effect , it is too tiny to be seen in the data . in the first and third case , black dotted bands in the upper and lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasepi ] , around @xmath101 gev@xmath63 , the phase has a few - degree step which is due to the opening , at @xmath102 , of the @xmath37 branch cut in the unphysical riemann sheet .",
    "the fact that such a branch cut , which is present also in the second and fourth case at higher @xmath0 values , does not spoil analyticity , as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sucsec : fit - function ] , is proven by the smoothness of the modulus of the @xmath2 at the same @xmath0 .",
    "+ the worsening of the agreement between model and data at @xmath0 values higher than @xmath103  gev@xmath63 is a consequence of substantial inelastic contributions to the pion ff , which have no effect in the @xmath96 scattering and hence , as expected , the identity between the phase of the pion ff and the phase shift of @xmath96 elastic scattering in p - wave is not valid for those @xmath0 s .",
    "+ the pion ff has been extensively investigated , theoretically and experimentally , recently and in the past , because it represents a powerful playground for phenomenological models , as well as for descriptions based on first principles .",
    "our study complements a wide literature on the subject  @xcite , by providing a model able to describe the world pion ff data with a rigorously analytic vmd - based parametrization .",
