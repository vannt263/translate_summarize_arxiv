    "<S> as the first experimentally confirmed ferroelectric metal , lioso@xmath0 has received extensive research attention recently . using density - functional calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we perform a systematic study on the origin of the metallic ferroelectricity in lioso@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we * *  * * confirm that the ferroelectric transition in this compound is order - disorder like . in addition , we find that the distribution of the conduction electron is extremely anisotropic , which suggests that the electric screening ability is also highly anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> then , by doing electron screening analysis , we unambiguously demonstrate that the long range _ _  _ _ ferroelectric order in lioso@xmath0 results from the incomplete screening of the dipole - dipole interaction along the nearest neighboring li - li chain direction . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude highly anisotropic screening and local dipole - dipole interactions are two most important keys to form lioso@xmath0-type metallic ferroelectricity .        </S>",
    "<S> the ferroelectric ( fe ) instability can be explained by a delicate balance between short - range elastic restoring forces supporting the undistorted paraelectric ( pe ) structure and long - range coulomb interactions favoring the fe phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> itinerant electrons can screen the electric fields and inhibit the electrostatic forces , metallic systems are thus not expected to exhibit ferroelectric like structural distortion . despite the incompatibility , using a phenomenological theory , anderson and blount proposed in 1965 _ _  </S>",
    "<S> _ _ that metals can break inversion symmetry anderson . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the fe metal is possible through a continuous structural transition accompanied by the appearance of a polar axis , and the disappearance of an inversion center @xcite . in 2004 , cd@xmath1re@xmath2o@xmath3 had been proposed as a rare example of ferroelectric metals @xcite , however , it was found that although this compound exhibits a second order phase transition to a structure that lacks inversion symmetry , a unique polar axis could not be identified @xcite , which does not fit the criteria about the fe metal .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , the first convincing success was achieved experimentally in lioso@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lioso@xmath0 remains metallic behavior while it undergoes a second - order phase transition from the high temperature centrosymmetric @xmath4 to a fe - like @xmath5 structure at @xmath6  =  140k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> neutron and x - ray diffraction studies showed that the structural phase transition involves the displacements of li ions accompanying also a slight shift of o ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure and lattice instability were studied by several groups lso1,lso2,lso3 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the local polar distortion in lioso@xmath0 is solely due to the instability of the _ </S>",
    "<S> a_-site li ion lso1,lso2,lso3 . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the coulomb interaction among 5@xmath7 electrons and the hybridization between oxygen @xmath8 orbitals and os empty @xmath9 orbitals has also been emphasized by giovannetti and capone@xcite . despite these efforts devoted to understanding the origin of the fe like structural transition in this metallic system , </S>",
    "<S> there are still two fundamental issues have not been clearly clarified . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the origin of the ferroelectric instability : is it displacive or order - disorder ? </S>",
    "<S> second , as fe - like phase transition of lioso@xmath0 occurs at a relatively high temperature ( 140 k ) , how can these local dipoles lined up to form long - range order , as if there is no conduction electrons to screen the dipole interactions .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> based on the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , we reveal the microscopic mechanism for the fe - like structural transition in lioso@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that different from other 5@xmath7 transition metal oxides @xcite , the spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) and the electronic correlation do not play important role in lioso@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> our comprehensive potential surface calculations suggest that the structural transition is order - disorder like . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking finding is that the electric screening in lioso@xmath0 is highly anisotropic despite its metallic nature . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the dipole - dipole interactions are unscreened along certain directions , which results in the long range fe order at considerably high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast to the case in the displacive type fe compounds , where the fe structural transition is usually driven by hybridization or lone - pair @xcite and consequently the change of electric dipole ( namely the atomic motion ) will modify the valence band significantly . if such displacive type fe compounds become metallic , the interactions between their electric dipoles will be strongly screened out , and the metallic fe phase is highly unlikely to occur .    before the formal presentation of the calculated results , we would like to first discuss our strategy to study the electric screening effect . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , the major difference between the insulator and metal is that there are free non - localized electrons in metals , whereas in insulators there are only bound electrons . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , electrostatic forces will be strongly screened by the itinerant electron in the metallic system . </S>",
    "<S> the screening effect actually can be described as the electron charge difference induced by a perturbation such as the change of the dipole or external electric field @xcite . yet </S>",
    "<S> seldom efforts have been carried out to study the screening effect in the bulk metal , as people generally believe there is no macroscopic electric field inside metals . </S>",
    "<S> but in current study we will control the formation of local dipoles in the bulk metal and study the charge difference ( response ) caused by the change of dipole . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a explicit picture on the exact behavior of the screening effect in metallic systems .    . the green , blue and red balls are the li , os and o ions respectively . @xmath7 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 corresponds to the displacements of li ions along the polar axis . </S>",
    "<S> , width=8 ]    our first - principles calculation is performed using the vasp ( vienna ab - initio simulation package ) code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in the following are obtained by using the gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) pbe ( perdew - becke - erzenhof ) function @xcite , a 20@xmath1220@xmath1320 mesh for the brillouin - zone sampling and 500 ev for cut - off of the plane - wave basis set . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of exchange - correlation function , pseudopotential , cut - off value has been carefully checked , and some of the results are shown in the supplementary materials @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .atomic positions ( in primitive rhombohedral coordinates ) in pe and fe phases . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     above we have provided a qualitative picture about why locale dipole interactions are not fully screened in lioso@xmath0 . to give a more quantitative explanation , </S>",
    "<S> we try to estimate the interaction strength between the local electric dipole moments . again using the above adopted supercell , we obtain coupling constant @xmath14 ( @xmath15=1 - 6 ) between the @xmath15 th li pairs from the energy difference between the local fe * *  * * and antiferroelectric ( afe ) states ( @xmath15 th li pairs are afe ordered ) , i.e @xmath16[e@xmath17-e@xmath18/2 . the li - li distances @xmath19 of each pair and the obtained interaction parameter @xmath14 are listed in table ii . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the above screening discussions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are much larger than all of other interactions , indicating the dipole interactions are highly anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> despite @xmath22 is longer than @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 is considerably larger than @xmath27 , @xmath28 and  @xmath29 as shown in table ii , which also indicate the anisotropic screening effect in this metallic compound .    to show these dipole interaction parameters obtained in above procedure are reasonable </S>",
    "<S> , we perform the monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations using an effective ising - like hamiltonian : @xmath30 , @xmath14 is the coupling constant between dipole moments @xmath31 and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained phase transition temperature is 210 k with only @xmath20 considered and 330 k with both @xmath20 and @xmath21 considered , which is reasonably higher than the experimental @xmath6 ( 140 k ) , and the overestimation may come from the rigid dipole model used in our mc simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this , again , show that our explanation on the mechanism of the lineup of local dipoles in metallic lioso@xmath0 is self consistent .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we use a straightforward way to study the electric screening effect in bulk metallic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that microscopic mechanism of metallic ferroelectricity in lioso@xmath0 is not related spin - orbital interaction or electronic correlation , as one may expect for 5__d _ _ system . </S>",
    "<S> it is the highly inhomogeneous charge distribution in this metallic system plays crucial roles in the ferroelectric - like structural transition . </S>",
    "<S> the highly ionized li atoms are easy to form local dipoles as a consequence of the coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the screening in this compound , different from our previous thought for a metallic system , is strongly anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> therefore local dipole interactions along certain directions are not fully screened and result in the dipole ordering below rather high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also want to emphasis that the above picture implied that the structural phase transition should be order - disorder instead of displacive type , which is also supported by our potential energy surface calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the displacive - type ferroelectric transition occurring in abo@xmath0 perovskite structures are general triggered by the hybridization between the b and o electronic states or the lone - pair in a site . in either case the change of the electric dipole will modify the valence band considerably . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in displacive system the dipole - dipole interaction will be strongly screened out in the metallic phase .    </S>",
