    "consider a body with angular momentum @xmath0 and electric charge @xmath1 .",

    "the following inequality is expected to hold for all bodies @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , @xmath5 the speed of light and @xmath6 is an universal dimensionless constant .",
    "these kinds of inequalities for bodies were presented in @xcite .",
    "they were motivated from similar kind of inequalities valid for black holes ( see the review article @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the question of the `` minimum size '' for a charged object ( i.e. the case @xmath7 ) was first studied in @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results were obtained in @xcite for the case @xmath8 and in @xcite for the case @xmath7 .",
    "heuristic physical arguments that support the inequality for the case @xmath8 were presented in @xcite and also , in that reference , a version of this inequality was proved for constant density bodies , using a suitable definition of size .",
    "khuri @xcite has proved it in a much more general case , using the same measure of size as in @xcite .",
    "however , these inequalities are not expected to be sharp .",
    "recently khuri @xcite has proved a general version of inequality in the case @xmath7 using a similar ( but not identical ) measure of size as the one used in @xcite and @xcite . as in the previous case , this result is not expected to be sharp .    in these references",
    "the inequalities have been studied in the two separated cases @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "the full inequality ( [ eq:2v ] ) was presented for first time in @xcite using a completely different kind of heuristic arguments : they are motivated by the bekenstein bounds for the entropy of a body .",
    "an important property of the inequality ( [ eq:2v ] ) is that there is only one universal constant @xmath6 to be fixed .",
    "also , a rigidity statement for the inequality ( [ eq:2v ] ) was conjectured in @xcite : the equality is achieved if and only the entropy of the body is zero . in general relativity , this statement appears to imply that the equality can not be achieved for a non - trivial body .",
    "the precise mathematical formulation of inequality ( [ eq:2v ] ) involves several difficulties .",
    "the most severe one is perhaps the definition of the size @xmath2 for a body in a general spacetime .",
    "an appropriate definition of @xmath2 is both difficult to find and non - unique .",
    "spherically symmetric spacetimes represent an exception : the area radius of the boundary of the body is a canonical definition for @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study inequality ( [ eq:2v ] ) in spherical symmetry ( in particular , this implies @xmath7 )",
    ". we will prove several important properties of inequality ( [ eq:2v ] ) which currently can not be proved in a more general setting .",
    "this will also allow us to present the correct setting of the inequality in the general case .",
    "first of all , we determine the universal constant @xmath6 to be @xmath9 secondly , we prove that inequality ( [ eq:2v ] ) is sharp and strict : the equality can not be achieved for a non - trivial body .",
    "moreover , the equality is achieved in the asymptotic limit where the radius , charge and mass of the body tend to zero .",
    "this is completely consistent with the argument presented in @xcite : the equality implies that the entropy of the body is zero .",
    "in particular , a black hole can not reach the equality in ( [ eq:2v ] ) since it has always a non - zero entropy and hence there is a gap between inequalities for bodies and similar inequalities for black holes ( which reach equality for extreme black holes ) .",
    "this gap is given by a difference of a factor @xmath10 in both inequalities .",
    "the existence of this gap is perhaps the most relevant result presented in this article .    finally , we prove that the correct setting for this inequality is an isolated body that is not contained in a black hole . inside a black hole",
    ", the inequality can be violated .",
    "the appropriate definition for a body in this context is then : a region of an asymptotically flat initial data that is not inside a horizon .",
    "the plan of the article is the following .",
    "in section [ s : main ] we present our main result given by theorem [ teo ] and we also discuss in detail it physical implications . in section [",
    "s : proof ] we prove theorem [ teo ] . in section [",
    "s : numerical ] we present numerical examples that illustrate the assertions in theorem [ teo ] .",
    "finally , in appendix [ s : id ] we summarize useful properties of spherically symmetric initial data set . in the following we use geometrized units where @xmath11 .",
    "the geometrical inequality between size and charge is appropriately formulated in terms of an _ initial data set _ for the einstein equations . for the present results ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to spherically symmetric initial data where the 3-dimensional riemannian manifold is taken to be @xmath12 .",
    "we call them _ regular spherically symmetric _ initial data .",
    "we also assume that the data are _ asymptotically flat_. this kind of data has been extensively studied in a series of articles by guven and  murchadha @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ s : id ] we summarize their basic properties and definitions .",
    "let @xmath13 be a sphere centered at the origin with area radius @xmath2 .",
    "that is , the area of @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the ball enclosed by @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath15 .    for a sphere @xmath13",
    "we define the null expansions @xmath16 and @xmath17 by .",
    "a region between two concentric balls is said to be _ untrapped _ if @xmath18 on that region .",
    "the region it is said to be _ trapped _ if @xmath19 .",
    "the outer boundary of a trapped region on an asymptotically flat data is called a _",
    "horizon _ and it satisfies @xmath20 . the area radius of the horizon is denoted by @xmath21 .    [ teo ]",
    "consider a regular spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat , initial data set .",
    "assume that there exists a ball @xmath15 with finite radius @xmath2 such that outside @xmath15 the data satisfy the electrovacuum constraint equations .",
    "assume also that in @xmath15 the dominant energy condition holds .",
    "let @xmath1 be the total charge of @xmath15 , we assume @xmath22 . then    * if the exterior region outside @xmath15 is untrapped , the inequality @xmath23 holds .",
    "* if there is a horizon outside @xmath15 , then the radius @xmath21 of the horizon satisfies the inequality @xmath24 the equality in ( [ ineq2 ] ) is achieved for the horizon of the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "moreover , we have :    * the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is sharp in the following sense : there exists a sequence of initial data that satisfy all the hypothesis of item ( i ) and such that in the limit the equality in ( [ ineq1 ] ) is achieved . in this limit ,",
    "the radius , the charge and the total mass of this sequence tend to zero . *",
    "the hypothesis of asymptotic flatness is necessary : there are examples of initial data which are not asymptotically flat but otherwise satisfy all the hypothesis in ( i ) for which the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is violated . * in the case ( ii ) there are examples where the radius @xmath2 of the ball @xmath15 ( which is inside the horizon ) violate the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) .",
    "let us discuss the scope and physical implications of this theorem .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , the original motivation to conjecture an inequality of the form ( [ ineq1 ] ) for bodies comes from the analogous kind of inequalities valid for black holes , namely , in our present setting , inequality ( [ ineq2 ] ) . in reference",
    "@xcite it has been shown that inequality ( [ ineq2 ] ) is valid for general horizons ( i.e. no symmetry assumptions ) , it is a purely quasilocal inequality ( i.e. no asymptotically flat assumption is needed ) and the equality is achieved for extreme black holes . since black holes are the `` most concentrated objects '' one would expect naively that for fixed charge , the minimum possible radius in an inequality of the form ( [ ineq1 ] ) is achieved for a black hole .",
    "remarkably , theorem [ teo ] shows that it is not true : for fixed charge @xmath1 , the minimum possible radius is @xmath25 ( and not @xmath26 as in the case of a black hole ) .",
    "example ( a ) shows that this minimum radius is achieved in the asymptotic limit where the radius , the charge and the total mass of the body ( which is not inside a black hole ) tends to zero .",
    "non - trivial bodies always satisfy the strict inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion presented in @xcite : the equality in implies that the entropy of the body is zero .",
    "black holes ( and also extreme black holes ) have non - zero entropy , hence there should be a gap between inequalities ( for bodies ) and ( for black holes ) , since the latter saturate for extreme black holes .",
    "theorem [ teo ] shows that this gap is a factor @xmath10 .",
    "the canonical definition of radius in spherical symmetry is the areal radius @xmath2 .",
    "there exists however another possible choice for the radius of a ball @xmath15 : the geodesic distance to the center . but this radius has the disadvantage that it can not be used , in general , for a black hole to obtain this kind of inequalities .",
    "the black hole inequalities involve the area of the horizon or quantities that depend , as the area , only on the geometry of the horizon ( for example , the shape of the horizon , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the interior of the black hole does not appear to have any physical meaning in this context .",
    "in particular , the geodesic distance and also the radius used in @xcite @xcite @xcite depend on the interior geometry of the body and hence , in principle , they can not be applied to black holes . in theorem",
    "[ teo ] , for the fist time , the same radius definition is used for both bodies and black holes .",
    "finally we note that for some families of spherically symmetric initial data it can be proved that the geodesic radius is greater than the areal radius ( see @xcite @xcite ) and hence for those cases , inequality is also satisfied for the geodesic radius .",
    "as we mention above , for a black hole the inequality can be proved without using any asymptotic assumption .",
    "it depends only on the local geometry near the horizon .",
    "this fact may suggest that a similar result can be proved for a body @xmath15 .",
    "namely , making hypothesis in the interior of the ball @xmath15 ( regularity and dominant energy condition ) and in a neighbourhood of the boundary @xmath13 ( the boundary is untrapped ) .",
    "however example ( b ) shows that this is not possible .",
    "example ( c ) shows that inside a black hole the ball @xmath15 with fixed charge @xmath1 can be compressed to a radius @xmath2 that violates the inequality . and hence the hypothesis that the exterior region is untrapped is necessary .",
    "both examples ( b ) y ( c ) show that the correct setting for inequality in general ( i.e. without any symmetry assumption ) is the following : on an asymptotically flat initial data we consider a region that is not contained in a black hole , this region is the appropriate definition of `` ordinary body '' in this context .",
    "these are precisely the hypotheses used in the results presented @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also note that these hypotheses are required for the validity of the bekenstein bounds for the entropy ( see @xcite @xcite and reference therein ) .    in the spirit of the general results obtained in @xcite and @xcite about existence of black hole due to concentration of angular momentum and charge , from theorem [ teo ] we deduce the following corollary .",
    "consider a regular spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat , initial data set .",
    "assume that there exists a ball @xmath15 with finite radius @xmath2 such that outside @xmath15 the data satisfy the electrovacuum constraint equations .",
    "assume also that in @xmath15 the dominant energy condition holds .",
    "let @xmath1 be the total charge of @xmath15 . if @xmath27 then there are trapped surfaces enclosing @xmath15 .",
    "example ( c ) shows that this corollary is not empty .",
    "we will see that in this example the data are not time symmetric and not maximal .",
    "the proof is divided naturally in three parts , given by the following sections [ s : part1 ] , [ s : part2 ] and [ s : part3 ] .",
    "the exterior region of the ball is , by assumption , an asymptotically flat spherically symmetric solution of the electrovacuum einstein equations .",
    "hence , by birkhoff s theorem , this region is described by the reissner - nordstrm metric which depends only on two parameters : the mass and the charge .",
    "this simple characterization of the exterior region is the key simplification introduced by the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "however , it turns out , that we do not need the full strength of birkhoff s theorem in the proof .",
    "we only need to compute the null expansions of the spheres in term of the mass and the charge . in section [ s :",
    "part1 ] , for the sake of completeness , we present a proof of this result . in the spirit of theorem [ teo ] , this proof is constructed purely in terms of the constraint equations , in contrast with standard proof of birkhoff s theorem where the full einstein equations are used .    in section [ s : part2 ]",
    "we prove the inequalities ( [ ineq1 ] ) and ( [ ineq2 ] ) .",
    "the key ingredient , introduced by reiris in @xcite , is the monotonicity of the hawking energy ( equivalent to the misner - sharp energy in spherical symmetry ) on untrapped regions .",
    "finally in section [ s : part3 ] we construct the three important examples ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this examples are constructed using charged thin shells .",
    "consider the constraint equations ( [ eq : hamiltonean])([eq : momentum ] ) in the exterior region of the ball @xmath15 .",
    "the electrovacuum assumption and the spherical symmetry imply @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we first solve the maxwell constraint equations ( [ maxwell ] ) in the exterior region , for the electric field we obtain @xmath31 where @xmath1 is the total charge of the ball given by ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "for the magnetic field we obtain a similar solution , but since we assume that there are not magnetic charges the magnetic field vanishes .",
    "then we have @xmath32 and hence the constraint equations ( [ eq : hamiltonean])([eq : momentum ] ) reduce to @xmath33 from equation ( [ c2 ] ) we obtain @xmath34 we multiply equation ( [ c1 ] ) by @xmath35 and use the relation ( [ eq:8 ] ) to obtain @xmath36 we rearrange terms in equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) to finally get @xmath37    define the function @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the null expansions defined by ( [ eq : expansions ] ) .",
    "note that the first term in ( [ ce ] ) is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "we calculate @xmath43 @xmath44 we have that @xmath43 it is proportional to the last term of ( [ ce ] ) .",
    "then , using ( [ deff ] ) and ( [ f ] ) we write ( [ ce ] ) in the following form @xmath45 we group the first two term in as a total derivative to finally obtain @xmath46 equation ( [ cea ] ) can be integrated explicitly , the function @xmath42 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant .",
    "up to now , the calculations are local .",
    "if we assume that the exterior region is asymptotically flat , then the constant @xmath48 that appears in the function @xmath42 is the total mass ( adm mass ) of the initial data .",
    "a simple way to obtain this relation is by using the misner - sharp energy defined by @xmath49 using the definition of @xmath42 we write @xmath50 in the form @xmath51 from this expression we calculate the constant @xmath48 in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath1 @xmath52 a well known property of the energy @xmath50 is that at infinity is equal to the mass @xmath53 of the initial data ( see @xcite ) @xmath54 then , taking this limit in equation ( [ eq : ef ] ) we finally obtain @xmath55 , and hence the final expression for @xmath50 is give by @xmath56    we have computed the product of the null expansions @xmath57 in terms of the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath1 @xmath58 this formula together with the formula for @xmath50 given by ( [ eq : ern ] ) are the only properties of the exterior region that will be used in the following steps of the proof .      in this section",
    "we will prove the inequalities ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "we have proved in the previous section [ s : part1 ] that the product of the null expansions ( i.e. the function @xmath42 defined by ( [ eq:34 ] ) ) is characterized by only two parameters : the mass @xmath53 and the charge @xmath1 .",
    "we treat separately the cases @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "assume that the ball is located at the value @xmath61 of the geodesic distance to center , that is @xmath62 .",
    "the exterior region is defined by @xmath63 with @xmath64 .    if @xmath65 , then @xmath42 has two real roots ( or one double root in the case of equality ) at @xmath66 note that @xmath67 .    for the exterior region",
    "we have two possibilities : either there exists at least one point @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 ) such that @xmath70 or there is no such a point .",
    "consider the first case .",
    "since @xmath71 at @xmath72 , the exterior region is not untrapped and hence we are in the case ( ii ) of the theorem .",
    "the horizon of the data is located as follows . if there is only one point @xmath68 such that @xmath73 , we take this point .",
    "if there are many points that achieve the value @xmath72 we take the most exterior one , i.e. if @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we take @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath68 be such point .",
    "the asymptotic flatness assumption implies that @xmath76 then @xmath77 for @xmath78 ( if not , this will contradict the assumption that @xmath68 is the most exterior point with @xmath79 ) .",
    "and hence there are no trapped surfaces in the region @xmath80 .",
    "then , we have shown that @xmath81 is the horizon of the data .",
    "the area radius of the horizon is @xmath72 , hence we have @xmath82 this proves the inequality ( [ ineq2 ] ) of theorem [ teo ] .",
    "note that for extreme reissner - nordstrm ( i.e. @xmath83 ) the equality is achieved in ( [ eq:13v ] ) .",
    "consider now the second case . if there are no points @xmath68 , with @xmath69 such that @xmath70 , then by ( [ eq:35 ] ) we have that @xmath84 for all @xmath64 .",
    "the exterior region is untrapped and we are in the case ( i ) of theorem [ teo ] .",
    "we have proved that @xmath85 we emphasize that a stronger version of the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is satisfied for that case , since in ( [ eq:36 ] ) the factor @xmath10 is absent .",
    "note that in the previous argument we have not mentioned the radius @xmath86 , but we have used that @xmath87 .",
    "for example , the ball @xmath15 could be in the region @xmath88 which is untrapped .",
    "however , since @xmath87 and we have condition ( [ eq:35 ] ) in that case there will be always a point @xmath68 in the exterior region such that @xmath70 .",
    "the case @xmath60 is the most relevant one and it was proved by reiris @xcite . in what follows",
    "we essentially reproduce reiris s proof .",
    "the crucial ingredient is that the misner - sharp energy ( [ eq:10 ] ) is monotonic on untrapped regions ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that on the region @xmath89 the dominant energy condition is satisfied and @xmath90 , @xmath91 , then @xmath92    we first prove the following result which is interesting by itself :    [ l : ball ] consider a regular ball @xmath15 , such that the dominant energy condition is satisfied on @xmath15 .",
    "if on the boundary @xmath13 of the ball @xmath15 we have @xmath90 , @xmath91 , then the misner - sharp energy of the boundary is non - negative @xmath93    note that we are not assuming that the ball is embedded in an asymptotically flat data , this is a quasilocal result that depends only on the interior of the ball .",
    "denote by @xmath61 the geodesic radius of the ball @xmath15 , that is @xmath62 . to prove ( [ eq:37 ] ) we argue as follows .",
    "there are two cases : either the interior of @xmath15 is untrapped or not . consider the first case . since we have that @xmath90 , @xmath91 on the boundary , if the interior is untrapped ( i.e. @xmath18 ) we obtain that @xmath90 , @xmath91 in @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that in the limit @xmath94 the misner - sharp energy is non - negative ( see , for example , @xcite section 6.1.2 ) . since in the region",
    "@xmath15 we have @xmath90 , @xmath91 we can use ( [ eq:24v ] ) with @xmath95 and @xmath96 to obtain @xmath97 for the second case , we have , by assumption , that near the boundary @xmath18 . hence , if the interior region of @xmath15 is not untrapped there should be a radius @xmath81 in the interior of @xmath15 such that @xmath20 .",
    "from the expression ( [ eq:10 ] ) we have that the energy on @xmath81 is non - negative @xmath98 in the region @xmath99 we have @xmath90 , @xmath91 and hence we can use ( [ eq:24v ] ) to obtain @xmath100    we continue with the proof .",
    "note that since we have assumed @xmath60 the exterior region is untrapped , and hence we are in the case ( i ) of theorem [ teo ] .",
    "moreover , since the data are asymptotically flat for large @xmath101 we have that @xmath91 and @xmath90 and hence , since the exterior region is untrapped , we obtain @xmath91 and @xmath90 in the whole exterior region .",
    "we can explicitly compute the misner - sharp energy @xmath50 of the boundary of the ball @xmath15 using formula ( [ eq : ern ] ) and using lemma [ l : ball ] we obtain @xmath102 that is , @xmath103 we use that @xmath60 to deduce from ( [ eq:13 ] ) the desired inequality @xmath104    finally , we prove that the inequality ( [ eq:14v ] ) is strict , that is , no material ball can achieve the equality in ( [ eq:14v ] ) .",
    "we argue by contradiction .",
    "assume there exists a ball @xmath15 such that @xmath105 .",
    "by assumption , the exterior region is untrapped and hence the function @xmath42 is positive on that region .",
    "we have two cases : @xmath106 or @xmath60 . for the first case we have already proved above that the stricter inequality ( [ eq:36 ] )",
    "is satisfied , and hence it is not possible to achieve @xmath105 for that case .",
    "consider the second case @xmath60 .",
    "we compute the energy @xmath107 at the boundary @xmath108 where we have used that @xmath105 .",
    "then , the energy is negative and that contradicts lemma [ l : ball ] .",
    "we construct in this section the examples ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of initial data mentioned in theorem [ teo ] .",
    "all the examples and much of the intuition which led to the very formulation of theorem [ teo ] were extracted from the study of charged thin shells performed by boulware @xcite . in that reference the complete dynamics of charged thin shells in the spacetime is characterized . however , in this section we construct only initial data solving the constraints in a self contained manner .",
    "we make contact with the spacetime picture just to favor the visualization .",
    "we begin with the example ( a ) .",
    "consider the following spherically symmetric metric @xmath109 where the radial function @xmath63 is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath112 is the area radius function corresponding to the reissner - nordstrm metric with mass @xmath53 and charge @xmath1 .",
    "that is , @xmath112 is the solution of the following differential equation @xmath113 the integration constant in ( [ eq:39 ] ) is fixed by the requirement @xmath114 and hence the function @xmath63 defined by ( [ eq:25 ] ) is continuous .",

    "secondly , the calculations presented here can have further applications to test similar inequalities with different definition of radius , like the one presented in @xcite .    to solve the constraint equations ( [ eq : hamiltonean])([eq : momentum ] ) we proceed as follows .",
