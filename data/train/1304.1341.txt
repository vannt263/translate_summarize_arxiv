    "we have studied the detailed temperature and energy dependence of low - energy magnetic fluctuations in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "a discrepancy between the magnetic ordering temperature derived by neutrons and muons shows that the spins undergo freezing rather than a regular phase transition .",
    "we find additional evidence for freezing in the temperature dependence of the low - energy fluctuations , which resembles the behavior observed in lsco at much lower doping , in the non - superconducting , so - called spin - glass regime , and therefore conclude that even superconducting la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 exhibits spin glass behavior .",
    "below the spin - freezing temperature @xmath5 k of our sample , we have detected an incomplete suppression of magnetic spectral weight at energies larger than our energy resolution , @xmath126 , but smaller than @xmath127 mev .",
    "we ascribe this effect to the development of a spin anisotropy gap in a spin frozen setting . applying insights from spin wave theory ,",
    "this interpretation is supported by the insensitivity , to within our experimental resolution , of the low - energy intensity suppression to an applied magnetic field of 10  t. it is notable , that the low - energy excitations in our la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 sample are remarkably similar to those of la@xmath8ba@xmath9cuo@xmath2 which displays long - range spin and charge stripe order .",
    "in contrast to the insensitivity of the anisotropy gap to applied magnetic field , a significant enhancement of nominally elastic , incommensurate magnetic signal was observed at temperatures lower than @xmath73 .",
    "given that muon spin rotation yields a freezing temperature @xmath7 much smaller than @xmath11 , the implication is that there must be a magnetic field effect on remnant spin excitations at energies inside our resolution window @xmath128 mev .",
    "our experimental data and a comparison with published data on lbco and lsco have illuminated that the sharp maximum in the spin freezing temperature @xmath7 near @xmath12 is reflected equally dramatically in the lowest energy magnetic excitations , as the superconducting gap observed at optimal doping is replaced by a spin anisotropy gap sufficiently close to the maximum in @xmath7 .",
