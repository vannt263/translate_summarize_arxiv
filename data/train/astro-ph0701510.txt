    "ever since type ia supernova ( sn ia ) measurements first indicated an accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite , the focus of cosmology has shifted dramatically . over the last several years",
    ", the primary aim of many cosmological observations has been to discover the reason for this accelerated expansion .",
    "the name we often give to the unknown cause of the acceleration is `` dark energy . '' in this context , dark energy represents not only the possibility of a hitherto undiscovered component of the energy density of the universe but also the possibility that the standard models of gravity and/or particle physics require revision .",
    "the essence ( `` equation of state : supernovae trace cosmic expansion '' ) supernova survey is an ongoing project that aims to measure the equation - of - state parameter of dark energy to better than 10% @xcite . in this paper , we use the first cosmological results paper from the essence supernova survey ( * ? ? ? * hereafter wv07 ) , where distances and redshifts for a large sample of newly discovered high - redshift sne ia are reported .",
    "moreover , wv07 performed consistent light - curve fitting of not only the essence sample of supernovae but also the local sample @xcite as well as the sn ia data released by the supernova legacy survey ( snls ; * ? ? ? * ) . combining this with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ; * ? ? ? * ) , wv07 placed constraints on the dark energy equation - of - state parameter of @xmath1 ( statistical @xmath2)@xmath3 ( systematic ) and on the matter density of @xmath4 ( statistical 1@xmath5 ) for a flat universe .",
    "+ to extend the analysis presented by wv07 we have    \\(1 ) added the 30 sne ia detected at @xmath6 by the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ as reported by @xcite ;    \\(2 ) included further constraints from a wider range of complementary observations ;    \\(3 ) allowed for more complex cosmological models by both relaxing the assumption of a flat universe and testing non - standard models inspired by new fundamental physics ; and    \\(4 ) applied model - comparison statistics to decide on the model best preferred by the current data .    today",
    "s sn ia results are accommodated in what has become the concordance cosmology @xcite , flanked by constraints on the matter density , @xmath7 , from large - scale structure measurements and on the flatness of space from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the concordance cosmology is dominated by dark energy , @xmath8 , with present evidence being consistent with einstein s cosmological constant , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we refer to the model with a cosmological constant as the standard model , or @xmath9 model .",
    "however , uncertainty remains over whether the cosmological constant is indeed the complete description of dark energy or whether the dark energy might have more complex behavior .",
    "this question is motivated by the enormous discrepancy between the theoretical prediction for the cosmological constant and its measured value @xcite .",
    "that we apparently live in an era when @xmath10 and @xmath7 are almost equal , known as the `` coincidence problem , '' also suggests that we may have an incomplete cosmological model .",
    "thus , a variety of suggestions for new physics have emerged .",
    "some of these suggestions take the form of variations of the equations of general relativity ( e.g. , the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others invoke more complex and evolving forms of dark energy ( e.g. , quintessence ; * ? ? ?",
    "a basic way to explore more complex models is to parameterize the dark energy by an equation - of - state parameter @xmath11 , relating the dark - energy pressure , @xmath12 , to its density , @xmath13 , via @xmath14 .",
    "( hereafter we set @xmath15 . )",
    "this parameter may be time variable and characterizes how the energy density evolves with the scale factor , @xmath16 : @xmath17 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : modelcomparison ] we discuss information criteria in the context of cosmological model selection .",
    "section  [ sect : data ] details the data sets used , their individual systematics and assumptions , and our method of combining them .",
    "section  [ sect : models ] describes each model in turn and assesses which is preferred by the data , the results of which are discussed in sect .  [ sect : results ] .",
    "parameter fitting and goodness - of - fit ( gof ) , where @xmath18 is the incomplete gamma function and @xmath19 is the number of degrees of freedom . it gives the probability of obtaining data that are a worse fit to the model , assuming that the model is correct . ] tests alone are not effective ways to decide between possible models .",
    "these statistical measures are based on the assumption that the underlying model is the correct one .",
    "the @xmath20 statistic can test the validity of a particular model , but comparing relative likelihoods based on the @xmath20 values of different models does not properly account for the structural differences between them .",
    "in other words , @xmath20 statistics are good at finding the best parameters in a model but are insufficient for deciding whether the model itself is the best one .",
    "one might be tempted to prefer the model that gives the best fit to the data , defined as the lowest @xmath20 . however , this does not account for the relative complexity of the models . to give a blatant example",
    ", a 10th - order polynomial will _ always _ give an equal or better fit than a straight line to any data set , but this does not mean that any of the extra eight coefficients have any significance .",
    "it just means that a model with more parameters will generally give an improved fit ( always , if the simpler model is a subclass of the more complex one ) .",
    "moreover , even though many cosmological models can be expressed in terms of a `` @xmath11 '' that describes the dynamical behavior of dark energy , the different functional parameterizations used by different models mean that they are not referring to the same thing .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath11 that the data prefer is integrally related to the model used in a fit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this difficulty makes it unwise to compare different models by simply considering likelihood contours or best - fit parameters .",
    "for example , the constant , @xmath11 , that appears in the standard dark - energy model ( sect .",
    "[ sect : w ] ) is not the same parameter as the constant , @xmath21 , that appears in the @xmath22 parameterization of the variable dark - energy model ( sect .",
    "[ sect : wa ] ) .",
    "so if the best - fit value of @xmath21 drifts away from @xmath23 it does not rule out @xmath24 .",
    "instead we turn to information criteria ( ic ) to assess the strength of models .",
    "these statistics favor models that give a good fit with fewer parameters . in this paper",
    "we use the bayesian information criterion ( bic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the akaike information criterion ( aic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to select the best - fit models .",
    "@xcite examines the use of information criteria in the context of cosmological observations , and we follow his prescription here .",
    "previous explorations into aic and bic in a cosmological context include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the bic ( also known as the schwarz information criterion ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the maximum likelihood , @xmath27 is the number of parameters , and @xmath28 is the number of data points used in the fit . note that for gaussian errors , @xmath29 , and the difference in bic can be simplified to @xmath30 .",
    "a difference in bic ( @xmath31bic ) of 2 is considered positive evidence against the model with the higher bic , while a @xmath31bic of 6 is considered strong evidence @xcite .",
    "the aic @xcite , @xmath32 gives results similar to the bic approach , although the aic is more lenient on models with extra parameters for any reasonably sized data set ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , @xcite give a version of the aic corrected for small sample sizes , @xmath34 , which is important when n / k 40 @xcite .",
    "the correction is negligible in our case ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "both tests can be applied to unrelated models ( the simpler model need not be nested in the more complex model ) .",
    "these criteria make an attempt to quantify occam s razor .",
    "when two models fit the data equally well , the simpler model ( the one with fewer free parameters ) is preferred .",
    "a poor information criterion result can arise in two ways : ( 1 ) when the model is a poor fit to the data , regardless of the number of free parameters ; in this case a large reduced @xmath20 value indicates that the model does not explain the data ; and ( 2 ) when the data are too poor to constrain the extra parameters in the model ; such a model would be disfavored by information criteria if a simpler model is available , but it may well be that with improved data the more complex model becomes preferred .",
    "thus , information criteria alone can at most say that a more complex model is _ not necessary _ to explain the data . in this paper",
    ", we find this to be the current situation for dynamical dark - energy models .",
    "the simple prescription for information criteria above is limited .",
    "a more in - depth analysis of the improvement gained by more complex models would not simply count parameters , but would consider how much the allowed volume in data space increases due to the addition of extra parameters ( i.e. how much more flexible the model becomes ) , as well as any correlations between the parameters .",
    "bayesian model selection is a technique that takes this into account using bayesian evidence , i.e. , the average likelihood of a model over its prior parameter ranges .",
    "@xcite pioneered the use of bayesian evidence in cosmology and @xcite analyze a variety of different parameterizations of dark energy , @xmath11 , finding that the standard cosmological constant remains the favored model .",
    "other studies include @xcite . for this paper ,",
    "we have used the first approximation provided by the ic without calculating the full bayesian evidence .",
    "this simpler version is sufficient for our purposes , and when systematic errors dominate the uncertainty in the data ( as has now become true for sn data sets ) , further statistical analysis becomes unwarranted .",
    "ic also require no assumptions for the prior or the metric on the space of model parameters .",
    "in order to test the different models , we have used observational data from a variety of sources described below .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one of the prime new data sets in this work is the sn ia data from the essence project .",
    "the essence project is a ground - based survey designed to detect and monitor about 200 sne  ia in the redshift range @xmath36 .",
    "the strategy and implementation of this project are described by @xcite , and the goal of the completed survey is to constrain @xmath11 with a precision of @xmath37 . with the recent release of the first 4 years of data and their cosmological implications ( wv07 ) , we are now in an excellent position to probe further cosmological models .    another large , high - quality supernova search , the snls , recently published an extensive and homogeneous first - year data set @xcite . in combining the two data sets we have leaned on the light - curve fitting performed by wv07 , who fit all sne from these different data sets with the same light - curve fitter , mcls2k2 @xcite .",
    "following wv07 , the uncertainty added due to the intrinsic diversity of sne ia is 0.10 mag ( assuming a peculiar velocity uncertainty of 400 km  s@xmath38 ) .",
    "we have used the data from table 9 in wv07 , including only those sne for which the light - curve fits passed the quality cuts .",
    "that includes 60 essence supernovae , 57 snls supernovae , and 45 nearby supernovae .",
    "we also incorporate the new data release of 30 sne  ia , at @xmath39 detected by _",
    "hst _ and classified as `` gold '' supernovae by @xcite .",
    "such high-@xmath0 data are particularly useful for this analysis because the sn ia constraints on the _ evolution _ of @xmath11 are improved as the range of redshifts is extended .",
    "we adopted the local supernovae that these samples had in common in order to normalize the luminosity distances of the samples , and we included the uncertainty in this normalization in the distance errors for the _ hst _ sne  ia .    ideally these two data sets should both be generated using the same light - curve fitter , in which case no normalization would be required .",
    "this is in progress , and in the interim we provide the combined data set as used in this paper .",
    "we note that any statistical analysis of the type we perform here may be limited by systematic errors in the data .",
    "possible sources of systematic error in the supernova data include local velocity structures @xcite and the treatment of dust @xcite .",
    "wv07 concentrate much of their discussion on the analysis of systematic errors and how to minimize them .",
    "they calculate that the systematic error in supernova data gives a maximum uncertainty in @xmath11 of 0.13 for the flat , constant-@xmath11 model when combined with bao constraints .",
    "the characteristic angular scale of the first peak in the cmb anisotropy spectrum is given by , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the comoving size of the sound horizon at last scattering [ roughly proportional to @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the comoving angular distance to the last - scattering surface .",
    "following the prescription given by @xcite and @xcite , we have converted the _ wmap _ three - year result @xcite on the location of the first peak to a reduced distance to the last - scattering surface , @xmath44=1.71\\pm 0.03,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and @xmath23 , respectively . , and this is used by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "find @xmath48 when allowing nonzero cosmic curvature .",
    "the small difference has a negligible effect on the results . ]",
    "the value of this parameter is somewhat model dependent .",
    "for example , it changes slightly when massive neutrinos are included @xcite , and it is weakly dependent on the density of the dark energy at the last scattering surface ( through the @xmath49 term : see * ? ? ?",
    ". using @xmath50 therefore artificially excludes some models with , for example , strongly varying dark energy .",
    "however , constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) rule out models with vastly different expansion dynamics from the standard model at the time of nucleosynthesis @xcite , so this is not an unreasonable exclusion . the bbn results may change if not only gravitational dynamics but also particle physics processes changed in any of the models .    the robustness of the shift parameter is tested in @xcite compared to fitting the full cmb power spectrum , and they confirm that it is an accurate measure for non - standard cosmologies such as those tested here .",
    "degeneracies that arise from using @xmath51 rather than fitting the full cmb power spectrum are well constrained by other data such as baos and sne .",
    "similar to the use of the angular scale of the first peak in the cmb spectrum , we can use the measurement of the peak at @xmath52 mpc of the large - scale correlation function of luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite to further constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the large - scale correlation function is a combination of the correlations measured in the radial ( redshift space ) and the transverse ( angular space ) direction , and thus the relevant distance measure is the so - called dilation scale , @xmath53^{1/3}\\ , \\ ] ] at the typical redshift of the galaxy sample , @xmath54 .",
    "the absolute scale of the bao is given by the sound horizon at last scattering , and the dimensionless combination @xmath55 is well constrained by the bao data to be @xmath56      there are additional sources of observations , which are potentially important for constraining cosmological parameters , that we have not included in this analysis .",
    "we have , for example , chosen to omit any information from distant gamma - ray bursts @xcite since such data are rather controversial @xcite .",
    "we have also not used the constraints from x - ray data on relaxed galaxy clusters @xcite , although this method may well become important in the future .",
    "the weak lensing data from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are an additional source of data that we have omitted here .",
    "at least some of these additional sources of information will become increasingly important as the data improve .",
    "apart from geometrical probes , as a consistency check we have used large - scale structure constraints on the growth factor as measured by the two degree field galaxy redshift survey .",
    "the constraints on the models from the growth factor are similar , but weak , compared to the bao constraints .",
    "since the computation of the growth factor in modified gravity models is potentially very complicated , we have chosen not to include those constraints in the final analysis .      both the distance to the last - scattering surface derived from the cmb and the bao constraints depend on the baryon density ( @xmath57 ) and its uncertainty , and for this we use the value obtained from _ wmap_. however , the dependence of bao on baryon density is weak [ @xmath58 @xcite ] , and for distance - related parameters , baos and cmb are independent",

    "the advanced cosmological probes being planned for the next decade and beyond @xcite will improve considerably on current constraints and will be able to vigorously test the @xmath9 model . if the results of these future experiments remain consistent with @xmath9 , it would raise an interesting question .",
    "is there a point at which we should accept @xmath9 and abandon our scrutiny of more complex models ?",
    "this is particularly problematic when alternative models are able to match the @xmath9 model to arbitrary precision .",
    "the answer is likely to be two - fold .",
    "observers will continue to improve on current techniques and may discover new techniques that could break the degeneracy for some of these models .",
    "alternatively , theoretical considerations , such as the discovery of a quantum theory of gravity that makes accurate predictions in other realms of physics , may indicate a preference for a particular model .",
    "the last four models we tested , flat dgp , dgp , standard chaplygin , and flat standard chaplygin , are clearly disfavored .",
    "they have fewer parameters than models like flat @xmath22 , but they score poorly because they are unable to provide a good fit to the data",
    ". they do not reduce to flat @xmath9 for any values of their parameters .    in summary ,",
