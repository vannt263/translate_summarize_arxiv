    "hadronization of heavy quarks produced in hadron - hadron interactions is still an open problem .",
    "the hadronization of quarks is in the realm of non - perturbative qcd and not calculable from first principles yet .",
    "this is by far the less known aspect of heavy hadron production .",
    "the leading particle effect , which has been observed by several experiments in charm meson and baryon hadroproduction , indicates that charm hadronization can not proceed by uncorrelated fragmentation alone .",
    "furthermore , this effect implies the existence of some sort of recombination mechanism in the hadronization process .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the leading particle effect , among them , the intrinsic charm mechanism  @xcite and the conventional recombination two component model  @xcite .",
    "however , until now , no clear distinction has been made between the intrinsic charm and the conventional recombination mechanism .",
    "the reason is that there is no experimental measurements of hadron antihadron production asymmetries and differential cross sections simultaneously . as an exemption we can quote the wa82  @xcite and the wa92  @xcite experiments .",
    "these two experiments measured the @xmath4 and @xmath5 asymmetries and differential cross sections as a function of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . however , although there is some indications that the intrinsic charm model can not describe simultaneously asymmetries and differential cross sections , these data are not conclusive as for the production mechanism .    recently , the selex collaboration presented results on the @xmath8 production asymmetries and particle distributions as a function of @xmath6 in the @xmath9 reactions  @xcite .",
    "selex is a fixed target experiment with a beam average momentum of @xmath10 gev/@xmath11 .",
    "as we will show in the following , these results clearly favor the recombination over the intrinsic charm hypothesis as the dominant contribution to leading particle effects ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    furthermore , e791",
    "@xcite results on @xmath12 production asymmetries in @xmath13 gev/@xmath11 @xmath14 interactions seem to imply that other contributions like associated production of charm mesons should play a role in the observed asymmetry .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to note that the @xmath15 asymmetry measured by the e791 collaboration  @xcite is similar to the @xmath12 asymmetry , implying that the hadronization mechanisms for charm and strange quarks would be the same  @xcite .    in",
    "what follows , we will focus our attention in the intrinsic charm  @xcite and recombination  @xcite two component models as applied to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 reactions .",
    "in two component models , the differential cross section is built on contributions from two different processes , namely , fragmentation of the heavy quarks ( denoted _ frag _ ) and from the intrinsic charm ( _ ic _ ) or recombination mechanisms ( _ rec _ ) , @xmath18 the first term gives the same contribution to @xmath19 than to @xmath20 production , since no differences arise in charm or anticharm fragmentation .",
    "contributions coming from the second term are , however , different for the @xmath19 and the @xmath20 , thus generating a production asymmetry .",
    "the production asymmetry is defined as    @xmath21    in a two components model , the production asymmetry would be given by @xmath22    in what follows we will analyse each contribution to eq  ( [ eq1 ] ) , and hence to eq .  ( [ eq1b ] ) , separately .      the first component in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , which describes the production of heavy hadrons through the fragmentation of heavy quarks , is given by ( see e.g. ref .",

    "+ ...   \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and contain contributions from the pqcd processes @xmath26 , @xmath27 , etc , and from the structure of the initial hadrons @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the peterson fragmentation function given by  @xcite @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the momentum fraction , the trasverse momentum and the rapidity of the heavy quark respectively . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the momentum fractions of light quarks inside the initial hadrons @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "as the fragmentation function  ( [ eq1c ] ) is the same for @xmath11 and @xmath37 fragmentation , this term gives no contribution to the production asymmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq1b ] ) at leading order . at",
    "next to leading order , a small @xmath38 asymmetry translates into a tiny @xmath39 asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , this effect , which is very small , produces a negative asymmetry in disagreement with experimental observations .    in our calculations",
    "we have used the grv - lo parton distribution functions in proton and pions  @xcite , @xmath40 , @xmath41 gev and @xmath42 in the peterson fragmentation function .      in @xmath16 reactions ,",
    "the intrinsic charm contribution comes from fluctuations of the beam protons to the @xmath43 fock state , which breaks up in the collision contributing to @xmath19 production .",
    "the @xmath19 differential cross section for this process is  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the probability of the @xmath43 fluctuation of the proton and @xmath46 , which gives the probability of the fluctuation , is a parameter which must be fixed adequately to describe experimental data .    to obtain a @xmath20 in @xmath47 interactions , a fluctuation of the proton to the @xmath48 fock state",
    "is required . since the probability of a five - quarks state is larger than for a nine - quarks fock state , @xmath19 production",
    "is favored over @xmath20 in proton initiated reactions .",
    "a similar expression to those of eqs .  ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) can be found for the @xmath20 differential cross section . however , its contribution is negligible .",
    "a similar mechanism is at work in @xmath14 interactions .",
    "however , @xmath0 production in @xmath49 initiated reactions requires fluctuations of the pion to @xmath50 or @xmath51 fock states .",
    "then , after the break - up , a @xmath52 or @xmath53 is formed , respectively , in the final state . since the invariant mass of both final states should be approximately the same",
    ", the contribution to @xmath19 is the same than for @xmath20 production and no asymmetry at all is obtained .",
    "the conventional recombination contribution to the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in @xmath47 interactions has the form  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the multiquark distribution and @xmath56 the recombination function . as for the intrinsic charm model",
    ", @xmath46 is a parameter which must be fixed from experimental data .",
    "@xmath57 ( i=1,2,3 ) are the momentum fractions of quarks in the initial proton which will be valence quarks in the final @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the recombination model assumes that there exist charm quarks inside the proton .",
    "the process of charm production occurs at a scale of the order of @xmath58 , which is above the threshold for the perturbative production of charm inside the proton  @xcite .",
    "the charm inside the proton can have both , a non - perturbative and a perturbative origin due to qcd evolution , with the first existing over a scale independent of @xmath59 .",
    "however , for @xmath58 the perturbative component must be dominant .",
    "leading particle effects in the recombination model are due to the different contributions to the multiquark distribution . actually , for @xmath19 production in @xmath47 interactions @xmath60 while for @xmath20 production @xmath61 the multiquark distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) recibes contributions from valence and sea quarks in the proton whereas the multiquark distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) has contributions coming from the sea of the proton alone .",
    "@xmath62 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) correlates in momentum the single quark distributions .",
    "we used  @xcite @xmath63 for both , @xmath19 and @xmath20 production .    for the recombination function we simply used  @xcite @xmath64 with the parameter @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) fixed by the condition  @xcite @xmath66    in @xmath17 , the differential cross section and the recombination function are given by expressions formally identical to those of eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) . however , the multiquark distribution function is different for @xmath19 and @xmath20 production . in fact , for @xmath19 we have @xmath67 while for @xmath20 it is @xmath68 here @xmath69 is a suppression factor lower than one . for the @xmath70 function we used the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "the origin of the suppression factor @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ eq102 ] ) can be understood as follows : for @xmath20 production , the multiquark distribution is built up from the @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath37 quark distributions in the pion .",
    "but , @xmath71 and @xmath72 quarks in the pion can easily annihilate with @xmath73 and @xmath74 valence quarks in the nucleon , thus reducing the amount of @xmath71 and @xmath72 quaks in the pion available to recombine into a @xmath20 .",
    "this suppression is not present in @xmath19 production since @xmath73 and @xmath74 quarks in the pion can only annihilate with @xmath71 and @xmath72 _ sea _ quarks in the nucleon .      in figs .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) we compare predictions of the _ ic _ and _ rec _ models to experimental data from selex  @xcite and e791  @xcite experiments on @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .    in order to fix the parameters in both models , we used @xmath77\\ ; , \\label{last}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is a global normalization factor .",
    "the individual cross sections for each contribution have been normalized to unity , except for the @xmath20 distribution in recombination in @xmath47 interactions , which has been normalized by means of @xmath79 to preserve the relative amount among @xmath19 and @xmath20 production .    in @xmath14 interactions the @xmath19 and @xmath20 recombination cross sections were normalized to unity .",
    "for the last one , the @xmath69 factor was included in the definition of the parameter @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) .    in this way we can have an approximate idea of the relative size of each contribution to the total cross section .",
    "furthermore , in order to have the curves shown in the figures , the parameters in the _ ic _ and _ rec _ models were fixed to values which best describe the differential cross sections .",
    "once this was done , the asymmetry was calculated .",
    "the @xmath69 parameter was fixed in order to have a good description of the asymmetry in @xmath14 interactions .    for @xmath0 production in @xmath47 interactions we used @xmath80 in the _ rec  ( ic ) _ model , indicating that recombination is a substantial part of @xmath3 production .",
    "the same value for the @xmath46 parameter was used for the _ rec _ model in @xmath14 interactions , but a slightly lower @xmath81 was used for the _ ic _ model . a suppression factor @xmath82",
    "is required to describe the production asymmetry in the _ rec _ model .",
    "it must be noted that equally good descriptions for both , the differential cross section and asymmetry , can be obtained in the framework of the _ rec _ model using values for @xmath46 in the range @xmath83 and varying the global normalization factor @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) accordingly .",
    "this means that parameters in the _ rec _ model can only be fixed with accuracy once data for the differential cross section on @xmath3 production in the low @xmath6 region ( @xmath84 ) become available .",
    "for the first time , experimental data on @xmath3 production and production asymmetries allow to distinguish among two different mechanisms of production and hadronization .",
    "it seems that the _ ic _ two components model do not describe simultaneously the differential cross sections and production asymmetries for @xmath0 produced in @xmath47 and @xmath14 interactions .",
    "conversely , the _ rec _ two component model seems to be a sensible approach to the problem , giving a good description of both , the @xmath3 differential cross section and the production asymmetry .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the _ rec _ two component model is able to explain the positive asymmetry observed by the e791  @xcite and selex  @xcite experiments in @xmath14 interactions .",
    "as discused in the text , the _ ic _ model predicts none asymmetry in this case .",
    "furthermore , the recombination mechanism seems to be more important than fragmentation .",
    "in fact , in @xmath85 the recombination contributions is 1 to 2 times bigger than fragmentation . the same is observed in @xmath86 .",
    "this is a clear signal that the debris of the initial hadrons play a fundamental role in the hadronization process .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , predictions in the framework of the _ ic _ model have been done on the @xmath0 production and asymmetry in @xmath87 interactions .",
    "although no comparison to experimental data is made a extremely hard behaviour is seen in the curves for the differential cross section .",
