    "the alkali metals produce strong resonance absorption lines in all late - type dwarfs .",
    "competing opacity sources such as the molecular bands of metal hydrides , titanium oxide or vanadium oxide , are removed from the atmosphere as one proceeds to cooler effective temperatures , and into the brown dwarf regime .",
    "first their opacity is replaced by continuous dust absorption characteristic of the spectra of l dwarfs , but as in late l and t dwarfs condensate grains settle below their fully radiative upper photosphere , the atmospheres become increasingly clear .",
    "the alkali elements bind less easily to molecules or grains , and thus their ground state transitions remain the last optical opacity sources , along with rayleigh scattering by h@xmath0 and he . due to the extreme transparency of the atmosphere their line wings form under very high density conditions and",
    "thus show among the strongest pressure broadening effects observed in stellar atmospheres , due to collisions with h@xmath0 and he .",
    "these massively broadened alkali lines therefore define the local pseudo - continuum out to several thousands of ngstrms from the line cores of the ki and naid doublets at 0.59 and 0.77  @xmath1 m , as has been shown by @xcite .",
    "the far wings of these lines show strong departures from van der waals theory and a simple lorentzian shape .",
    "precise modelling of the line shapes requires detailed quantum - mechanical calculations , using accurate inter - atomic potentials as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "detailed line profiles for all alkali resonance doublets ( li , na , k , rb , cs ) have been calculated by @xcite for perturbation by both h@xmath0 and he .",
    "these calculations , recently updated from the molecular potentials of @xcite for the h@xmath0 interaction to the newer ones of spiegelman ( in preparation , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are included in our stellar atmosphere models calculated with the ` phoenix ` code @xcite .",
    "compared to the previous generation of brown dwarf spectra described by @xcite , the detailed profiles in particular of the nai and ki doublets have produced much improved synthetic spectra of the red optical and near infrared region .      since the core ,",
    "near and far wings of these strong lines form along an extended optical path through the atmosphere , one also needs to know the numbers of absorbing atoms at all depth points contributing to the line .",
    "these can vary considerably with depth , as alkali metals and other refractory elements are being depleted in brown dwarf atmospheres by condensation onto grains , and eventually sedimentation of the condensates into deeper layers @xcite .",
    "condensation of dust particles has to be considered for effective temperatures below 2500k , i.e.  essentially for all dwarfs later than spectral type m. at @xmath2k the top of the cloud deck starts to sink into deeper parts of the atmosphere , receding to the optically thick layers at @xmath3 of 1200@xmath41400k , which marks the transition from spectral class l to t. condensate fractions for such objects therefore can no longer be determined from chemical equilibrium calculations such as those used in the equation of state of @xcite . in the`dusty '",
    "limit described in the former work condensates would be assumed to be present everywhere where they are thermodynamically stable , and to be in condensation / evaporation equilibrium with the gas phase .",
    "in contrast , in our current * settl * models the amount of dust and the fraction of metals still present in the gas phase is calculated by comparing timescales for grain growth and turbulent mixing driven by convective overshoot .",

    "the optical spectrum is reproduced extremely well , allowing us to identify for the first time the satellite feature located in the blue wing of the potassium line @xcite .",

    "* ) , the models significantly underestimate the absorption in the far wing for late t dwarfs . as this part of the spectrum forms very deep in the atmosphere , where temperatures even in such cool brown dwarfs are too high for any alkali condensation to occur",
    ", shortcomings of the cloud model can not be responsible for the mismatch in this case .",
    "a possible explanation may be found by testing the applicability of our line formation code to the conditions of the coolest t dwarfs .",
    "we use profiles of the alkali metal resonance lines calculated for perturbations due to neutral he and h@xmath0 as the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the dipole moment within the adiabatic theory , as detailed in @xcite . in the ` phoenix ` implementation the depth - dependent line opacity is calculated by splitting the profile into a core component , which is describing the interactions at long distance in the impact approximation , leading to a lorentzian line shape , and the far wings for close interactions that can produce the detunings of several 1000 observed in t dwarf spectra ( see also the contribution of g.  peach , these proceedings ) . the latter is computed in the low density limit using an expansion of the autocorrelation function in powers of density , which for the present models has been developed to the third order and evaluated at a perturber density of 10@xmath8@xmath9 . while this method allows an easy ( linear ) scaling to different perturber densities , one has to be aware that only the core part explicitly includes multiple perturber effects , while the non - linear behaviour of the higher - order terms of the density expansion is not correctly taken into account .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that at higher densities , where multiple perturber interactions become important even at close distances , higher perturber density does not merely increase the line strength , but affects the shape of the wings as well , and therefore the low density limit is only strictly applicable at densities up to 10@xmath8@xmath9 in the case of na or k broadened by h@xmath0 or he , and will quickly break down above 10@xmath10 .",
    "the density profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmodels ] show that this limit is quickly exceeded in t dwarfs at an optical depth of the order unity , where the far red wing of the ki doublet forms .",
    "while the h@xmath0 density stays just below 10@xmath11@xmath9 in mid - t dwarfs , it reaches several times that value for the latest t types in the case of massive brown dwarfs . for atmospheres of less than the log@xmath12 shown here , densities would be correspondingly lower , but such low gravities can only be expected for rather young objects @xcite . we thus find evidence that the ki absorption in the @xmath6-band is underestimated for the latest t dwarfs because their atmospheres significantly exceed the density range where the present line profile calculations may be applied .",

    "@xcite have investigated possible broadening effects of the nai  d doublet at even higher perturber densities , occuring for metal - rich white dwarfs with a helium - dominated atmosphere .",
    "they found that the density of he as a perturber in two very cool white dwarfs showing very strong na absorption could reach several 10@xmath17 to 10@xmath18 , depending on exact composition and temperature .",
    "they have directly compared the results of the density expansion model and the unified theory for the nai  d lines under these conditions . the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : naheprofs ] shows that at a he density of 10@xmath19 even carrying the density expansion to the 7@xmath13 order rather than just to the 3@xmath20 , the line strength in the wings falls short of the unified profile by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "yet the impact approximation can only reproduce the profile within a few 100 from the line core ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the right hand side illustrates that at the highest densities the far wings do not simply scale in strength , but also change their shape towards a wider profile , especially above 10@xmath19 .",
    "we expect a similar behaviour for the line shapes of the ki doublet with both he and h@xmath0 as perturbers .",
    "while conditions in brown dwarfs are somewhat less extreme than in ultracool white dwarfs , this example shows that the coolest t dwarfs , too , require line profile calculations taking multiple collision effects into account in a unified theory .",
    "new line profiles have greatly improved spectral models of all the alkali resonance lines .",
    "remaining discrepancies with observed line shapes of brown dwarfs for the cores and near wings can be traced to shortcomings of the cloud model for the high atmosphere .",
    "a lack of absorption in the very far wings becomes evident in the latest t dwarfs .",
    "comparison with nai lines observed in cool white dwarfs support our interpretation that these discrepancies are due to the extreme perturber densities , and that unified line profiles are needed to model atmospheres at such high pressure .",
    "this will become more important with cooler brown dwarfs still being discovered , and spectral models for the yet to be found y dwarfs needed .",
    "the additional opacity from alkali lines at high densities could also influence the radiative transfer in substellar atmosphere models even below the visible photosphere , possibly affecting the thermal structure , and thus cooling rate and evolution of both brown dwarfs and giant gas planets .",
