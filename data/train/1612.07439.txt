    "diffusion - weighted mri ( d - mri ) @xcite has become a widely used , non - invasive tool for clinical and experimental neuroscience due to its capability of characterizing tissue microstructure _ in vivo _ by making use of diffusion displacement measures of water molecules .",
    "specifically , high angular resolution diffusion imaging ( hardi ) enables extraction of accurate and detailed information about fiber tract directions through diffusion measurements made along a large number of spatial directions @xcite .",
    "such information is then used in fiber reconstruction algorithms ( tractography ) to facilitate better mapping of neuronal connections .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others , hardi techniques used for describing local diffusion characteristics may be categorized by the different sampling schemes in the q - space , namely , single @xmath2-shell techniques and multiple @xmath2-shell techniques . single @xmath2-shell techniques",
    "sample gradient vectors with a single _ bvalue _ ; whereas multiple @xmath2-shell techniques sample gradient vectors with multiple _ bvalues _ @xcite .",
    "single @xmath2-shell techniques include angular reconstruction models such as fiber orientation distribution ( fod or ffod ) estimation @xcite , diffusion orientation distribution function ( odf or dodf ) estimation @xcite , diffusion orientation transform ( dot ) @xcite and fiber ball imaging @xcite .",
    "different @xmath2-space sampling schemes and data representations are optimal for different analytical goals ; for example multiple @xmath2-shell techniques enable explicit modeling of separate cellular contributors to the d - mri signal .",
    "in this paper we focus on one single @xmath2-shell data representation , the fod , because it is designed to describe the local spatial arrangement of axonal fiber bundles in such a way that sharply - defined geometric features are preserved @xcite .",
    "this property makes the fod an attractive representation if the ultimate downstream analytic goal is fiber reconstruction through tractography .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel fod estimation method that makes use of sparse representation of the fod in a multiresolution basis on the unit sphere , named needlets @xcite . to estimate the fod from observed d - mri data , we adopt the spherical deconvolution framework described in @xcite and @xcite , and formulate the fod estimation problem as a regression problem .",
    "our method has the advantages of explicitly making use of the excellent function representation characteristics of needlets , which we exploit through the imposition of a sparsity inducing @xmath1 penalty on the needlet coefficients of the fod .",
    "in addition , we impose a non - negativity constraint on the estimated fod and design a computationally efficient estimation procedure .",
    "furthermore , we propose an effective and statistically reliable method for selecting the penalty parameters .",
    "these methodological innovations lead to improved statistical efficiency and better detection of fiber directions , as is demonstrated through extensive experiments . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", none of the existing methods for fod estimation incorporates all these salient features altogether .",
    "a key condition for successful spherical deconvolution - based estimation of fod is the availability of a parsimonious representation of the fod .",
    "this is due to the ill - conditioned nature of deconvolution problems , which manifests itself in the form of noise amplification when the effective number of coefficients in function representation is large @xcite .",
    "several popular fod estimation methods rely on spherical harmonics ( sh ) representation of the fod @xcite due to the nice analytical properties of sh basis , including the fact that they have closed form expressions in terms of legendre polynomials , and they are eigenfunctions of the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , when the function being represented has localized sharp peaks , as is expected of fods , sh basis does not provide an efficient representation due to the global support of its basis functions .    on the other hand , a collection of spherical functions that are localized in space and scale / frequency will yield a parsimonious representation for a spiky but otherwise regular function @xcite .",
    "this is highly desirable for fod estimation since it leads to an increase of effective signal - to - noise ratio and allows for utilizing sparsity - inducing regularization schemes .",
    "a class of such functions is the _ needlets _",
    "@xcite , described in detail in section [ subsec : needlet ] , which forms a special class of spherical wavelet frames .",
    "moreover , needlets are not only localized in both space and frequency , they are also smooth functions , which together ensure stable reconstruction of a spherical function in a needlet frame . in",
    "particularly , the tightness of the needlet frame , which translates into low mutual coherence and a simpler representation of spherical functions , is crucial for statistical efficiency when solving an inverse problem based on noisy data such as fod estimation from d - mri data studied here @xcite . due to these advantages , we propose to use needlets as a representer of fods .",
    "relying on the sparse representation enabled by the needlets , we propose a sparsity - inducing @xmath1-norm penalty on the needlet coefficients of the fod .",
    "the use of @xmath1 penalization enables a good estimation with sharp localized peaks even when the number of gradient directions and signal level are both moderate .",
    "in addition , since fod has a density interpretation , we impose a nonnegativity constraint on the estimated fod .",
    "importance of the nonnegativity restriction has been studied by @xcite , among others .",
    "the sparse inducing penalty ( @xmath1 and/or @xmath4 ) has been used for fod estimation by @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , fods are represented in a mono - resolution basis consisting of a large class of putative dodf functions , rather than a stable multi - resolution basis designed to enable a sparse representation . in @xcite , an ad - hoc dictionary of functions",
    "is used to represent fods under @xmath1 and @xmath4 penalization schemes .",
    "while these methods aim to give sparse solutions , their choice of representer may not lead to sparse representation of fods that are inhomogeneous spherical functions with sharp peaks .",
    "thus these estimators could suffer from bias and inefficiency in fod estimation .",
    "another class of methods relies on multi - tensor models , whereby the fod itself is modeled as a discrete mixture of unit direction vectors representing the orientation of different fiber bundles .",
    "a prominent work under this framework is by @xcite who use an @xmath1 penalty with a nonnegativity constraint for estimating the mixture fractions . for fod estimation using a multi - tensor model",
    ", the number of mixture components needs to be reasonably small to ensure identifiability of the parameters @xcite and low variability of the estimator .",
    "in contrast , needlets not only yield stable and sparse representation for smooth inhomogeneous functions , it also leads to an accurate and efficient approximation of finite mixtures of distinct directions since these can be well approximated by smooth inhomogeneous functions .",
    "therefore , needlet representation can lead to good estimation for a broader class of fods .",
    "one advantage of the approach in @xcite is that it naturally incorporates a multi - compartment framework with different response functions .",
    "it is possible to extend our approach to accommodate multiple compartments as is discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the proposed needlets based procedure also enables developments of model selection and inferential schemes within the well - established framework of nonparametric function estimation .",
    "specifically , we propose a data - driven scheme for the selection of the penalty parameter that aims to balance bias and variance in fod estimation .",
    "this is in contrast to the requirement of making ad - hoc choices of the regularization parameters in many existing methods in the literature .",
    "finally , we also develop an efficient computational scheme based on a fast implementation of spherical needlets transform ; and an efficient implementation of the nonnegativity constrained @xmath1 penalization problem through an _ alternating direction method of multipliers _",
    "algorithm @xcite .",
    "we conduct extensive experiments based on synthetic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and to compare it with two existing methods , namely , an sh based deconvolution with tikhonov regularization proposed by @xcite and the supercsd sharpening of the aforementioned sh - based estimator @xcite .",
    "we specifically look into small crossing angles since this is a challenging yet very important problem in resolving crossing fibers and we focus on high _ bvalue _ and/or high signal - to - noise ratio for such cases since this is the direction where the field is moving @xcite .",
    "the proposed method not only shows favorable performance compared to the competing methods , it is also able to recover fod when fiber crossing angle is as small as @xmath5 and automatically identify isotropic diffusion .",
    "we also apply these methods to two real 3 t d - mri data sets of healthy elderly individuals from the alzheimer s disease neuroimaging initiative ( adni ) database .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the proposed method and experiments based on both synthetic data and real d - mri data in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "we report the results of the experiments in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we make conclusions and discuss future directions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "much of the technical details and additional experimental results are reported in a supplementary material .",
    "we give a brief introduction to needlets and some of their relevant properties .",
    "detailed treatments , including their localization characteristics and approximation properties , are available in @xcite .",
    "needlets are constructed by complex - valued sh functions @xmath6 , which form an orthonormal basis for @xmath7 , the space of square integrable functions defined on unit sphere @xmath3 .",
    "the indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 , referred to as _ level index _ ( larger @xmath8 corresponds to higher angular frequency ) and _ phase index _ , respectively , together determine the wavy pattern of the function @xmath10 .",
    "needlets construction is based on two key ideas @xcite : ( a ) discretization of @xmath3 : if @xmath11 denotes the space spanned by @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , then for every @xmath14 , there exists a finite subset @xmath15 ( _ quadrature points _ ) and positive weights @xmath16 ( _ quadrature weights _ ) such that , for any @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the surface element of @xmath3 at @xmath20 ; and ( b ) littlewood - paley decomposition : this is through a function @xmath21 defined on @xmath22 satisfying : ( i ) @xmath23 on @xmath24 for some @xmath25 , and equal to zero on @xmath26 ; ( ii ) @xmath27 for all @xmath28 ; and ( iii ) @xmath29 .",
    "( @xmath30 is used in our construction ) .    with the above",
    ", a class of needlets @xmath31 can be defined as follows : for @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 encodes _ scale / frequency _ and @xmath35 encodes _ location _",
    "( determined by @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 is the @xmath8-th legendre polynomial .",
    "note that , the needlets are real valued spherical functions .",
    "it can be shown that needlets thus constructed are localized in both scale and space , with exponentially increasing concentration around the quadrature point @xmath36 as the scale index @xmath38 increases .",
    "the quadrature formula ( [ eq : quadrature_formula ] ) satisfied by needlets is an important factor behind the spatial concentration of needlets and the consequent advantages in terms of function approximation .",
    "the collection of needlets together with @xmath39 ( i.e. , the constant function on sphere ) also form a _ tight frame _ ( referred to as the needlets frame ) , i.e. , for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is called the _ needlet coefficient _ of @xmath43 corresponding to index pair @xmath44 . the tight frame property , together with the localization in space and scale , imply that needlets can be used to perform _ multiresolution analysis _ of functions in @xmath7 .    moreover , by ( [ eq : needlet_construct ] ) , the needlet coefficients of @xmath43 have the linear representation in terms of sh coefficients : @xmath45 ( [ eq : representation_sh_coeff ] ) provides a very useful computational tool since fast computational algorithms are available for sh transform @xcite .    in order to obtain the quadrature points @xmath46 and corresponding quadrature weights @xmath47",
    ", we make use of the healpix construction due to @xcite that partitions @xmath3 into @xmath48 spherical triangles of equal area , where @xmath49 is a power of two determining the resolution . then , @xmath36 s are chosen as the centroid of the triangles , while @xmath50 s are all equal to @xmath51 .",
    "since the fods are symmetric and real - valued , we construct symmetrized needlets which can be easily derived from the needlets .",
    "henceforth ( with slight abuse of notations ) , @xmath52 denote the real symmetric sh functions where @xmath53 @xcite and @xmath54 denote the symmetrized needlets functions .",
    "see the section [ sec : design ] in supplementary material for details .      in this section ,",
    "we first describe the spherical convolution model that relates fod , denoted by @xmath55 , with the diffusion signal function , denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "we view the observed diffusion weighted measurements @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath58 gradient directions as noise corrupted samples from the diffusion signal function @xmath56 evaluated at the respective gradient directions . after representing the fod in the sh basis ,",
    "we can then model the observed measurements by a linear regression model where the needlet coefficients of the fod are the regression coefficients .    following , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , it is assumed that the diffusion signal function @xmath56 is a spherical convolution of the fod @xmath59 , a symmetric spherical distribution ; with an azimuthal symmetric kernel @xmath60 ) \\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] .",
    "the kernel @xmath61 , referred to as the _ response function _ , represents the local diffusion characteristics of water molecules along neuronal fibers , which are assumed to be the same across different fiber bundles and voxels . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the response function @xmath62 , and hence its sh coefficients , are known . in practice",
    ", we may assume that @xmath62 belongs to a parametric family of nonnegative functions on @xmath63 $ ] ( e.g. , specified by a tensor model ) and then estimate the parameters based on voxels with a single dominant fiber bundle , typically characterized by high fractional anisotropy ( fa ) values .",
    "experimental results show that our method is robust to the specification of the response function ( results not reported ) .",
    "denote @xmath64 , and it is defined as @xmath65    diagonalizing in the sh basis , the sh coefficients of the diffusion signal function @xmath56 follow : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are the rotational harmonics and spherical harmonics coefficients of the response function and fod , respectively .",
    "moreover , by the orthonormality of the sh basis , we can express the diffusion signal function as : @xmath69    in the following , we assume that both @xmath56 and @xmath55 can be well approximated in a finite order real symmetric sh basis @xmath70 consisting of @xmath71 basis functions .",
    "the observed dwi measurements thus can be modeled as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an @xmath74 diagonal matrix with diagonal elements @xmath75 ( in blocks of length @xmath76 ) ; @xmath77 is the @xmath78 vector of sh coefficients of the fod @xmath79 ; @xmath80 is the @xmath81 matrix with the @xmath82-th row being @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are elevation angle and azimuthal angle , respectively , of the @xmath82-th gradient direction .",
    "the @xmath82-th coordinate of @xmath86 corresponds to the observed diffusion measurement along the @xmath82-th gradient direction ; and @xmath87 is an @xmath88 vector representing observational noise and possible approximation error .",
    "since the fod @xmath55 is expected to be either a constant function on the sphere ( when the diffusion is isotropic ) or a spherical function with a few sharp peaks ( each corresponding to a distinct major fiber bundle ) , the localization and tight frame properties of the needlets would imply that the needlet coefficients of @xmath55 form a sparse vector @xcite , i.e. , @xmath55 can be well approximated by a small fraction of needlet functions .    consider a symmetrized needlets frame with the first @xmath89 frame elements , where @xmath90 is the maximum level of needlets being used .",
    "@xmath91 is set to be @xmath92 such that sh functions up to level @xmath93 can be linearly represented in the first @xmath94 needlets .",
    "denote the @xmath95 needlet coefficients vector of @xmath55 by @xmath96 .",
    "then the sh coefficients @xmath97 of @xmath55 can be expressed as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is an @xmath100 matrix ( see section [ sec : design ] in supplementary material ) .",
    "this allows us to rewrite equation ( [ eq : dwi ] ) as @xmath101 a key point here is that @xmath99 can be easily computed , and so is the design matrix @xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , since the response function @xmath61 is the same across voxels , the design matrix needs to be computed only once .",
    "the sparseness of the fod needlet coefficients @xmath96 motivates us to propose a penalized regression estimate : @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes a sparsity - inducing penalty , with the tuning parameter @xmath105 controlling the degree of regularization , and @xmath106 is the matrix of sh basis functions ( up to level @xmath93 ) evaluated on a pre - specified dense evaluation grid .",
    "the constraint @xmath107 ensures that the estimated @xmath55 evaluated on this grid , i.e. , @xmath108 , is nonnegative .",
    "in the subsequent experiments , we use an equiangular grid with @xmath109 grid points .",
    "following @xcite and subsequent developments in the statistical literature , we propose to use an @xmath1 penalty @xmath110 .",
    "the estimation problem is then a convex optimization problem with a non - negativity constraint .",
    "we develop a computationally efficient algorithm based on the _ alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) _ @xcite to solve ( [ eq : wavelet_penalized_regression ] ) .",
    "admm is a general - purpose algorithm for solving convex optimization problems with constraints . finally , we rescale the estimated @xmath55 such that it integrates to one on the unit sphere .",
    "the details of the admm algorithm is given in section [ subsec : admm ] in supplementary material .",
    "since our goal here is to get a good estimate of fod , particularly one that is useful for subsequent analyses such as tractography , thus slight overfitting is less detrimental than underfitting .",
    "thus we propose a criterion which chooses the largest @xmath111 such that the penalty parameter values smaller than this value will lead to essentially the same residual sum of squares ( rss ) ( see section [ subsec : penalty ] in supplementary material for details ) .",
    "the commonly used model selection criteria such as bic @xcite and aic @xcite require specification of the degrees of freedom for the model which is difficult when the design matrix is ill - conditioned and non - smooth penalties such as the @xmath1 norm are used .",
    "experiments based on synthetic data show that the proposed strategy is able to strike a good balance between bias and variance in fod estimation and leads to better results than bic or aic ( results not reported ) .    after obtaining an estimated fod",
    ", we may want to identify major fiber bundle orientation(s ) , which could be used for subsequent analyses .",
    "ideally , this can be done through peak detection , i.e. , locating the local maxima of the ( estimated ) fod . however , since the estimated fod may have spurious peaks due to noise , we need to eliminate peaks that are likely to be false .",
    "we propose a simple yet effective peak detection algorithm based on grid search , followed by a pruning step and a clustering step to filter out potential false peaks .",
    "details are given in section [ subsec : peak ] in supplementary material .",
    "in this section , we describe experiments based on synthetic data to study the performance of the proposed estimator , referred to as ` sn - lasso ` , and to compare it with two competing fod estimators described below .",
    "in addition to the proposed ` sn - lasso ` , we also consider two existing fod estimators :    \\(i ) the ` sh - ridge ` estimator @xcite through a ridge type regression by minimizing : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the spherical laplacian operator and @xmath114 is a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath115 in blocks of size @xmath76 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "@xmath117 , referred to as the laplace - beltrami penalty , is a measure of roughness of spherical functions .",
    "the ` sh - ridge ` estimator is solved explicitly by : @xmath118 the penalty parameter @xmath111 can be chosen by the bayesian information criterion @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) ` super - csd ` estimator @xcite . the idea is to suppress small values of the estimated fod and consequently sharpen the peak(s ) of the fod estimator using an sh representation of order @xmath119 . in our experiments ,",
    "we apply ` super - csd ` algorithm to the ` sh - ridge ` estimates and consider @xmath120 .",
    "we refer to the corresponding estimators as ` scsd8 ` , ` scsd12 ` , and ` scsd16 ` , respectively . for other parameters in the ` super - csd ` algorithm , we follow the recommended values in @xcite . for more details , see section [ subsec : scsd ] in supplementary material .",
    "we consider fod estimation for a voxel with various scenarios of fiber populations .",
    "we use @xmath121 to denote the separation angle between a pair of crossing fiber bundles .",
    "our experimental settings include @xmath122 fiber bundles crossing at @xmath123 .",

    "we consider _ bvalue _ at @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( for small crossing angles only ) ; and three angular resolutions , namely , @xmath142 gradient directions on an equiangular grid .",
    "these settings aim to cover both commonly used values in large - scale d - mri experiments such as adni as well as high _ bvalue _ and/or high angular resolution d - mri experiments .",
    "the observed diffusion weighted measurements along the @xmath58 gradient directions are generated by adding independent rician noise @xcite to the respective noiseless diffusion signals .",

    "we report the statistical characteristics of the estimators ( across @xmath148 independent data sets ) by depicting the mean estimated fod in opaque color and the mean plus two standard deviations in translucent color .",
    "we also examine the performance of each estimator using various numerical metrics including : ( i ) the success rate of the peak detection algorithm applied to the @xmath148 estimated fods , where ` success ' means that the algorithm identifies the correct number of fiber bundles .",
    "( ii ) among the successful estimators , the mean angular errors between the identified peaks and the true fiber directions , as well as the bias of the estimated separation angle between pairs of fiber bundles . throughout , ",

    "data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the alzheimer s disease neuroimaging initiative ( adni ) database ( adni.loni.usc.edu ) .",
    "the adni was launched in 2003 as a public - private partnership , led by principal investigator michael w. weiner , md .",
    "the primary goal of adni has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , positron emission tomography ( pet ) , other biological markers , and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) and early alzheimer s disease ( ad ) .",

    "more specifically , for all four combinations of ` bvalue ` and @xmath178 , ` sn - lasso ` successfully identifies two peaks for at least 70% of the replicates with an average angular error ranging from @xmath179 . for detailed numerical summaries ,",

    "` sh - ridge ` leads to overly smoothed estimates and consequent loss of directionality information , while ` scsd ` estimators either tend to have large variability ( ` scsd12 , scsd16 ` ) or overly smoothed estimates ( ` scsd8 ` ) .",
    "consistent with the observations in @xcite , ` scsd8 ` works better for large - to - moderate crossing angles and ` scsd12 , scsd16 ` work better for small crossing angles .",
    "however , without prior knowledge of the crossing angle , in practice it would be hard to choose which ` scsd ` estimator to use .",
