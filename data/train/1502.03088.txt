    "since bell s paper @xcite entanglement has been studied and explored in depth .",
    "saying that quantum information branch emerged from extensive studies of phenomenon of entanglement would not be an exaggeration .",
    "entanglement has been used in many information - processing applications in which it either yields an advantage over the classical setting , e.g. , in communication complexity @xcite , or where a classical counterpart simply does nt exist , e.g. , in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , its device independent variant ( diqkd ) @xcite , teleportation , super dense coding @xcite , or pseudo - telepathy ( pt ) @xcite .",
    "although quantum theory allows for violations of bell inequalities ( bi ) , in certain cases the violations can not reach their maximum algebraically possible value .",
    "tsirelson was the first to find such upper bounds on bell values for quantum theory @xcite and to relate them to the grothendieck s inequality .",
    "much research has been done to explain why quantum mechanics does not lead to `` algebraic '' violations of bell inequalities @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "wehner and oppenheim argue that the trade - off between steerability and uncertainty determines how non - local a theory is . in @xcite ,",
    "cleve et al . gave an upper bound for the winning probability for xor games in the quantum setting ; their bound depends on the classical winning probability and the grothendieck s constant .",
    "note that xor game is a non - local game and that non - local games form a subset of general bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "the approach to bounding quantum violations via a grothendieck - type constant is now quite common and reasonably well understood .",
    "it leads to estimates for bell values that are of the form @xmath2 @xcite . in this work",
    "we develop a different strategy , where the bell value for a given inequality depends on the difference between the maximal algebraic value ( @xmath3 ) and maximal deterministic value ( @xmath4 ) of the inequality in question .",
    "specifically , we study quantitatively bell inequalities with @xmath0 inputs ( henceforth @xmath0 bi ) and give a _ universal bound _ on quantum bell values of these inequalities . to find this bound for @xmath0 bi",
    ", we introduce notion of _ fraction of determinism _ ( fod ) and show that it depends only on the number of outcomes alice and bob have at their sites .",
    "we claim that presence of fod prevents quantum bell value from attaining the maximal algebraic value of a bell type inequality .",
    "our paper is inspired by gisin et al .",
    "@xcite , which studied certain bell inequalities ( pseudo - telepathy ) for which quantum resources achieve algebraic violation .",
    "they show that to achieve such violations for these inequalities at minimum @xmath5 inputs are required . in other words , there is no @xmath0 bi for which quantum theory attains algebraic violation .",
    "here we uncover the heart of this effect  the fraction of determinism  and are able to give a quantitative bound for it .    .",
    "triangle inequality gives an upper bound @xmath6 , whereas _",
    "reverse triangle inequalities _ give lower bounds @xmath7 for general quantum states and @xmath8 for classical ( or commuting ) states .",
    "[ fig : trian_conj],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    while looking for a lower bound for fod , we proved a fundamental property of quantum states which is interesting on its own .",
    "namely , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are far from @xmath11 , then any convex mixture of them is also far from @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath12 and @xmath13 for some @xmath14 , then , for all @xmath15 $ ] , = ||p_1+(1-p)_2-||_12- ( ) . where @xmath16 .",
    "this inequality is in a sense dual to triangle inequality since it bounds the trace distance between @xmath17 and @xmath11 from below .",
    "accordingly , we call it `` reverse triangle inequality '' ( rti ) .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that for classical states ( commuting density matrices ) one can find lower bound of @xmath18 with the defect term linearly dependent on @xmath19 , while for non - commuting quantum states one can not in general have dependence better than @xmath20 .",
    "the second fundamental property which is used here is related to so called steering @xcite .",
    "namely , by making measurement on one site of the entangled state , one can create only those ensembles which give rise to the same density matrix  the reduced state of the entangled state .",
    "this implies that if we consider two such ensembles , there must be at least two elements ( one from one ensemble , and the other from the second ensemble that are not perfectly distinguishable .",
    "it has been apparently not studied to what extent they have to be indistinguishable . here , by using the reverse triangle inequality , we are able to give a robust quantitative bound ( lemma [ lemma - x ] ) , which is independent of the dimension of the underlying hilbert space",
    ". we shall use it further to give bound for fod , which in turn will allow to bound quantum violations for @xmath0 bell inequalities .",

    "the latter is equivalent to saying that they provide perfectly secure correlations .",
    "indeed , the fraction of determinism is at the same time the fraction that can be known by the third party , or equivalently one can say that fod in a given theory restricts bell value from reaching its maximal algebraic value .",
    "we present the following proposition which indeed captures this idea .",
