    "ever since its identification with a redshift 2.286 optical emission line source by rowan - robinson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , leading to an inferred bolometric luminosity @xmath10 , the iras source fsc10214 + 4724 has been the subject of enormous attention .",
    "detections of co ( brown & vanden bout 1991 ; solomon , downes & radford 1992 ; tsuboi & nakai 1992 ) and submillimeter continuum emission ( clements et al .",

    "1992 ) from the source confirmed the presence of huge quantities of gas and dust . with a vastly larger lookback time and luminosity than any other known iras source , fsc10214",
    "+ 4724 appeared to be either an extremely luminous dust embedded quasar , or a representative of a new class of astronomical object , e.g. a primeval galaxy .",
    "however , while the redshift of the iras source is secure , its intrinsic luminosity is less certain . the fact that fsc10214 + 4724 lies at the flux limit of the iras survey , combined with the presence of several red companion objects within a few arcseconds , led elston et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to suggest that the iras source might be gravitationally lensed by a foreground group of galaxies .",
    "intriguingly , matthews et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found arcs emerging from the source in a deconvolved @xmath11 band image with @xmath12 seeing taken with the keck telescope .",
    "matthews et al .",
    "considered the lensing hypothesis , but concluded it was unlikely because the image morphology was not achromatic .",
    "broadhurst & lehr ( 1995 ) modelled the source as gravitationally lensed , finding support for their model from a reanalysis of the matthews et al .",
    "graham & liu ( 1995 ) also argue for lensing , based on deconvolution of a more recent ( march 1995 ) keck @xmath11 band image with @xmath13 seeing .",
    "trentham ( 1995 ) argues on statistical grounds that magnification due to lensing is likely to be less than a factor of ten , although larger magnifications are reasonable for smaller far - ir source sizes than the 1 kpc trentham assumed .",
    "we present an image of fsc10214 + 4724 taken in december 1994 at 8000   with the _ hst _ wfpc2 planetary camera with @xmath14 resolution .",
    "this image provides dramatic support for the lensing hypothesis , implying a magnification in the _ hst _ data of @xmath15 .",
    "we use the image to derive a detailed model for the intrinsic properties of the lensed source and the lensing galaxy .    for reference , at the fsc 10214 + 4724 redshift @xmath16 , one @xmath17 planetary camera pixel subtends @xmath18pc for @xmath19 , while these values are @xmath20pc for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 km sec@xmath23mpc@xmath23 . where not otherwise specified , we assume @xmath24 km sec@xmath23mpc@xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "three frames , each 2200 seconds long , were obtained on consecutive orbits with the wfpc2 f814w filter on the 10th and 11th of december 1994 ( ut ) .",
    "fsc 10214 + 4724 was positioned near the center of the planetary camera , and each exposure was displaced from the other two by an integer number ( 5 or 10 ) of pc pixels in both axes .",
    "the wide field camera data are not considered here .",
    "after standard processing provided by stsci , the multiple frames were used to filter out cosmic rays and hot pixels . although these defects are quite prominent and affect roughly 4% of the pixels in each frame , the main characteristics of the combined image discussed in section  [ morphology ] are discernible in each frame even without this filtering .",
    "cross - correlations were performed on pairs of frames to confirm that the actual displacements between frames , as measured in pixels , were integers to within 0.2 pixels .",
    "the frames were then trimmed by the appropriate number of rows and columns to coregister them , and the stsdas task crrej was used to average them together , iteratively excluding pixels which deviated from the previous iteration s average value by more than three sigma .",
    "the minimum value at each pixel location was used for the initial estimate of the average , and sigma was the value expected from poisson statistics and the gain and read noise . to remove multiple pixel cosmic ray events , a stricter limit of 1.5 sigma",
    "was applied to the four pixels adjacent to any pixel which exceeded the three sigma criterion .",
    "finally a median filtering routine was applied to identify and interpolate over a few dozen isolated pixels which deviated sharply from their neighbors in the average image , presumably because they were corrupted in all three frames .",
    "none of these latter pixels fall within objects in the field , and only a handful of the pixels in the components discussed below are based on data from less than two frames .",
    "the combined image of the full planetary camera field is shown in figure 1(a ) , while figures 1(b ) and ( c ) show the fsc 10214 + 4724 region in progressively greater detail .",
    "a synthetic point spread function ( psf ) derived from the  tiny tim \" _ hst _ image modelling software package was used to deconvolve the average image , because a good empirical point spread function was not available ( see section  [ profiles ] ) .",
    "the synthetic psf was calculated for a source with the color of a k - star in f814w at the location of fsc10214 + 4724 in the planetary camera field .",
    "figure 1(d ) shows the same region covered in figure 1(c ) after a mild deconvolution of the data ( 10 iterations of the stsdas implementation of the lucy - richardson algorithm ) onto a grid subsampled four times more finely than the original pixels .      at the resolution of the planetary camera , an arc - like structure dominates the morphology of the emission line source . in the terminology of matthews et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which is adopted here , the arc - like structure is component 1 ( see fig .",
    "the extent of this arc is smaller than shown in matthews et al . , and there is a sharply defined ridge of high surface brightness emission which is @xmath2 long and essentially unresolved in the transverse direction .",
    "lower surface brightness emission can be seen extending the arc @xmath26 to the west , and a similar amount ( but at a considerably fainter level ) to the east - northeast .",
    "there is also a hint of still fainter emission extending a few tenths of an arcsecond due east ( _ not _ along a circular arc ) from the eastern tip of the bright ridge . within the bright ridge",
    "are at least two peaks separated by @xmath27 , with the brighter peak towards the east .",
    "the center of curvature of the arc was fitted and found to be @xmath28 west - northwest of the center of component 2 ( which is @xmath3 from the arc ) .",
    "component 2 has a smooth light distribution which is resolved and slightly elongated ( see sections  [ profiles ] and [ redshift ] ) .",
    "directly opposite component 2 from the arc is a faint but clearly visible source ( component 5 in figure 1(b ) ) , @xmath29 from the center of component 2 .",
    "component 3 is resolved and has a feature which is suggestive of a tidal arm leading back towards component 2 .",
    "component 4 appears to be a highly inclined galaxy .      in an attempt to quantify the radial extent of the arc , pixels from the sector subtended by the brightest @xmath30 of the arc at component 2",
    "were sorted in order of radius from component 2 . to reduce the effect of the tangential substructure along the arc , a running average of the flux from 5 pixels in this radially sorted list was calculated .",
    "figure  2 plots this running average flux as a function of the average radius of those pixels less the @xmath3 distance of component 1 from component 2 . for comparison , the ( unaveraged ) radial profiles are plotted for stars a and h ( see figure 1(a ) ) , for components 2 and 5 , and for the synthetic psf which was used in the deconvolution shown in figure 1(d ) .    while the wings of the synthetic psf fall inside those of the arc , the _ empirical _ psfs of stars a ( outside its saturated core ) and h match the arc cross section reasonably well .",
    "it therefore appears likely that the synthetic psf underestimates the fwhm of the true psf .",
    "based on the synthetic psf we estimate an upper limit of @xmath31 ( 500 pc ) for the intrinsic fwhm of the arc in the radial direction .",
    "note that the effects of the running average , of any error in using component  2 as the center of the arc , and of the smaller size of the synthetic psf all work in the direction of leading us to overestimate this dimension .",
    "the deconvolved image shown in figure 1(d ) also yields a @xmath31 fwhm for the arc , but this holds true for star h after deconvolution as well . because the individual frames are separated by integer numbers of pc pixels , there is little leverage on finer scale structure .",
    "deconvolution does emphasize the high surface brightness of the arc however , increasing it by a factor of three .",
    "in short , we see no evidence that component 1 is resolved in the radial direction .",
    "( in section  [ model ] we will argue that the intrinsic fwhm of the arc is @xmath32 ) .",
    "component 5 also appears unresolved , although its profile suffers from much lower signal to noise .",
    "component 2 , however , is clearly resolved in figure 2 . to extend the measurement of component 2 s surface brightness profile to larger radii",
    "the image was rotated @xmath33 about the center of component 2 , and pixels at the locations of other objects in the original image were replaced with pixels from the rotated image .",
    "this assumes elliptical symmetry for component 2 in the replaced regions , which cover a maximum of 25% ( at @xmath34 ) of the area at any radius , and 7% of the total area .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting radial surface brightness profile for component 2 .",
    "a devaucouleurs profile with an effective radius @xmath35 ( 10 kpc ) provides a much better fit to component 2 than do exponential disk models , suggesting that this object is an early type galaxy .",
    "the measured ellipticity of component 2 inside the arc is @xmath36 at a position angle of @xmath37 east of north .",
    "excess surface brightness appears near a radius of @xmath38 even though the component 1 pixels ( which are near this radius ) have been replaced . as a check",
    ", the surface brightness profile was measured within sectors centered on component 2 from position angles 73133@xmath39 and 233318@xmath39 , angles which bypass all obvious emission sources in figure 1(b ) .",
    "the value for @xmath40 in this case was @xmath41 ( a smaller @xmath40 is consistent with these sectors being along the minor axis ) , and excess light was again found near @xmath38 radius .",
    "the total excess light at this radius is very roughly equivalent to a 23rd magnitude source .",
    "photometric measurements obtained from the planetary camera image for the components are given in table 1 .",
    "one count in the image corresponds to @xmath42 erg/@xmath43/sec /  or to a magnitude of 30.00 in the f814w band with vega set to magnitude 0 . from the measured standard deviation per pixel , the sensitivity limit ( @xmath44 )",
    "is @xmath45 mag for a point source or @xmath46 mag arcsec@xmath47 .",
    "positions are relative to component 2 , whose position in the hst guide star system is given in table 1 .",
    "polygonal apertures were used to include the faint emission seen extending from components 1 and 3 . the flux for component 5",
    "was measured using a @xmath48 diameter aperture , with the local background measured using the mode of an annulus of width @xmath14 surrounding this aperture , and corrected for psf losses using the star h curve of growth .",
    "this flux was checked by subtracting away the image rotated @xmath33 about component 2 , and also by subtracting the elliptical model fit to component 2 discussed in section  [ profiles ] .",
    "all three methods consistently gave a value close to 100 for the flux ratio of component 1 to component 5 , and we adopt 100 for this important ratio for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the morphology of the components of fsc10214 + 4724 , a circular arc ( component  1 ) with its radius of curvature centered on another object ( component  2 ) , and another fainter image ( component  5 ) on the opposite side , strongly supports the gravitational lens hypothesis , i.e. that component  2 is a foreground galaxy and components  1 and 5 are images of a single background object . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the multiple imaging and the arclike morphology and high inferred luminosity of component  1 result from distortion and magnification by the gravitational potential of the foreground component  2 .",
    "components  3 and 4 are other galaxies along the line of sight , possibly related to the galaxy which is component  2 , and probably involved in the lensing .    the high resolution of the _ hst _ image makes the arc morphology and component 5 readily apparent , and allows us to directly measure the ratio of the brightnesses of these components .",
    "this morphology and ratio are crucial elements in the development of a lens model for the source .",
    "we find additional support for the lens hypothesis from the observed morphology of component  2 .",
    "in particular , as shown in appendix a , component  2 has the surface brightness profile and spectral energy distribution expected for a foreground elliptical galaxy , and its position angle is correctly predicted by the lens model . in the following , we adopt the interpretation of fsc10214 + 4724 as a gravitationally lensed system , and describe the detailed model of this system and its consequences .      in the context of a lens model ,",
    "component  1 is a `` straight arc '' and component  5 is a `` counterimage . ''",
    "this gravitational lens image configuration is very common ; it has been found in several clusters ( see surdej & soucail 1993 for a review ) .",
    "the model for these systems is that of a source lying on or very close to a cusp in a caustic ( a line of infinite magnification , e.g.  blandford & narayan , 1992 ) in the source plane . although the magnification of a point source lying on the caustic is formally infinite , the maximum magnification of a real object is limited by its finite angular radius @xmath49 . under the gravitational lens hypothesis",
    "the total magnification of the source should be on the same order as the flux ratio of arc to counterimage , roughly @xmath50 in this case .",
    "gravitational lens models also predict that the axis ratio of the arc should be on the same order as the total magnification .",
    "the @xmath2 length of the arc thus implies an observed width on the order of @xmath51 ( 50 pc ) , or unresolved even in _ hst _ images .",
    "in the case of lensing dominated by mass at a single redshift , the gravitational lens mapping , which takes a two - dimensional angular position @xmath52 on the image plane ( i.e.  the position observed on the sky ) to a two - dimensional angular position @xmath53 on the source plane ( i.e.  the position that would be observed if there was no lens ) , is a gradient mapping @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the two - dimensional gradient operator with respect to angular image - plane position @xmath52 , and @xmath56 is a scaled , projected , two - dimensional gravitational potential .",
    "the potential is related to the angular surface density @xmath57 ( mass per unit solid angle ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are angular diameter distances from observer to lens ( deflector ) , observer to source , and lens to source , and @xmath62 is the two - dimensional laplacian operator .    where not otherwise stated",
    ", the lens models which follow assume that the potential @xmath63 can be approximated with a quasi - isothermal sphere with ellipticity ( see , e.g.  kochanek , 1991 ) , i.e. , @xmath64 \\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the position of the point in question relative to the center of the mass distribution , @xmath66 is the asymptotic critical radius ( the radius of the einstein ring ) , roughly the angular radius of the circle of images ( @xmath67 in this system because that is the angular separation of arc and lens ) , @xmath68 is an ellipticity parameter , @xmath69 is the position angle of the major axis , and @xmath70 is a core radius .",
    "the results do not depend strongly on the core radius @xmath70 , so it is assumed to be zero .",
    "the critical radius @xmath66 can be related to a one - dimensional velocity dispersion for the lens by @xmath71 although this depends on the assumption of isothermality .",
    "more secure is the mass @xmath72 inside the `` circle of images '' ( in this case a circle of angular radius @xmath66 around component  2 ) , @xmath73 the mass @xmath72 and the inferred luminosity @xmath74 of the lens can be used to compute a mass - to - light ratio as well .",
    "the inferred physical properties of the lens depend strongly on lens and source redshifts and weakly on world model . in this system",
    "the lens redshift is unknown , so @xmath75 , @xmath72 , and @xmath76 are given in figure  4 as a function of lens redshift for the model adopted below .",
    "further discussion of figure  4 is deferred until section  [ redshift ]    model parameters @xmath66 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 were varied to minimize the scatter in the source plane positions corresponding to the brightest pixels in the arc and counterimage , i.e. : @xmath77 where the sum is over the brightest 96 pixels in the deconvolved arc and the brightest pixel in the counterimage ( figure 1(d ) ) , and @xmath78 is the two - dimensional displacement on the image plane through which pixel @xmath79 would need to be moved in order for it to project ( via the lens mapping ) to the same location on the source plane as that of the brightest pixel in the arc .",
    "image - plane rather than source - plane displacements were used for computing the scatter because the image plane is the observed plane , the plane on which uncertainties are homogeneous and isotropic . on the source plane",
    "the uncertainties have been mapped through the non - linear lens mapping and are extremely inhomogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "the minimum rms scatter of the pixels ( in image plane coordinates ) was 0.7 pc pixels .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are given in table  2 . the inferred intrinsic source radius which makes the arc - counterimage flux ratio 100 is @xmath80 ( 44 pc ) .",
    "the model makes the assumption that component  3 is a singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath81 ) at the same redshift as component  2 and with critical radius @xmath82 , the expected value under the assumption that components  2 and 3 have the same mass to ( @xmath11-band ) light ratio . a simpler model which assumes that the potential is entirely due to an elliptical shaped mass centered on component  2",
    "was also considered .",
    "the two - component model was adopted because the intrinsic ellipticity of the potential in this model is smaller than in the simpler model , in better agreement with the observed ellipticity in component  2 .",
    "this is because the external mass of component  3 has a tidal effect which replaces some of the ellipticity in the primary lens .",
    "the predicted orientation of the lens in the models is consistent with the observed orientation of component  2 .",
    "figure  1(f ) shows the density and potential contours for the adopted model , as well as the critical curve and the image morphology for a circular source of radius @xmath80 , smoothed to a fwhm of @xmath83 , and with the counterimage brightness enhanced for visibility .",
    "figure  1(e ) shows the model image morphology convolved with the synthetic psf discussed in section  [ results ] , and should be compared to figure  1(c ) .",
    "the image configuration in the lens model is that of a triple image or straight arc ( plus counterimage ) .",
    "although parts of the source are triply imaged in component  1 , the source radius inferred from the flux ratio of components 1 and 5 is large enough that the three images merge into a single straight arc .",
    "we interpret the peak in the east half of the arc as corresponding to two images merging on the critical curve , while the peak in the west half corresponds to the third image .",
    "the triple structure may become more apparent in high - resolution images in other bandpasses if the flux at those wavelengths is produced by structures offset by @xmath84 ( 160 pc ) from those which produce the f814w flux , or having intrinsic size scales a factor of @xmath85 smaller .",
    "the source location near the point at which three images on one side of the lens merge into a single image causes high magnification . as discussed by broadhurst and lehr ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the magnification is thus a sensitive function of source size and position .",
    "the inferred size and position in turn depend on the assumption of an isothermal profile for the lens potential , i.e.  @xmath86 . for a shallower potential @xmath87",
    ", the best - fit model puts the center of the source further inside the three - image region than for the isothermal case , and the inferred source radius from the arc - counterimage flux ratio is @xmath88 . for @xmath89",
    "the inferred source radius is @xmath90 .",
    "the predicted total magnification of f814w emission from a uniform circular source as a function of source radius is shown for all three potential models in figure  5 . in each case , the total magnification for the source radius derived above from the flux ratio of component  1 to component  5 ( i.e. 100 ) is less or greater than 100 because component  5 is somewhat demagnified or magnified .",
    "the dependence of the calculation of the total magnification in the _ hst _ image on the assumption of a circular source geometry for the f814w emission was investigated for the isothermal model .",
    "sources of the same total projected solid angle on the sky have the same total magnifications to within about 15% even if they are highly elliptical , no matter what their position angle .",
    "the magnification in the isothermal model scales as @xmath91 for very small sizes or separations from the caustic , and smoothly converts to @xmath92 at larger radii , in agreement with schneider , ehlers & falco ( 1992 ) , and can be approximated to @xmath93 by @xmath94 for the range @xmath95 ( 8 to 8000 pc ) .",
    "the kink at @xmath96 arcseconds in figure  5 for @xmath87 occurs where the source size becomes large enough to make the three distinct images merge into a single arc . because in the other two models the source location is closer to the point at which the three images merge , the source radii at which the mergers take place are too small to appear in figure  5 .",
    "the bump near @xmath97 in figure  5 corresponds to the formation of a ring ( see below ) .",
    "different distributions for the narrow line and uv and optical continuum regions , and the likelihood of substantial reddening ( elston et al .",
    "1994 ) , can therefore account for the substantially different appearance of fsc 10214 + 4724 at different wavelengths noted by matthews et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and in particular for the larger extent of the @xmath11-band arc seen by matthews et al . and graham and liu ( 1995 ) than the arc seen in the _ hst _ image .",
    "the @xmath98 extent of the @xmath11-band arc corresponds to a source with @xmath99 ( 2 kpc ) radius .",
    "if the source radius is increased to @xmath100 it is imaged into an elliptical ( @xmath101 ) ring connecting components  1 and 5 .",
    "the position angle of this ring is perpendicular to that of component  2 , and is offset from being perfectly centered on component  2 by @xmath102 in the direction of component  1 .",
    "the excess light near @xmath38 radius noted in section  [ profiles ] may be the uv ( rest frame ) counterpart of the more extended arc seen in the @xmath11 images .",
    "note that matthews et al .",
    "find the @xmath103 emission to be extended in an east - west direction by @xmath104 , suggesting that the narrow line region is largely coincident with the uv continuum which dominates the f814w image .",
    "fsc10214 + 4724 has an apparent luminosity of l@xmath105= 5@xmath10610@xmath107l@xmath108 ( rowan - robinson et al .",

    "the vast majority of this luminosity , @xmath10999% , is observed in the infrared ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ) .",

    "1995 ) enshrouded in dust ( h@xmath111h@xmath112 implying @xmath113 , elston et al .",
    "1994 ) , and that the quasar s luminosity is absorbed in the dust shell and reradiated in the infrared ( rowan - robinson 1993 ) .",
    "this implies that the size of the infrared emitting region is substantially larger than the optical / uv emitting region .",

    "however , if the infrared source is larger than the optical / uv source , the magnification of the infrared source is less than the magnification measured from the _ hst _ image .",
    "the magnification of the infrared source can be estimated by assuming that the infrared source can be approximated as an optically thick blackbody .",
    "this assumption corresponds to making the infrared source as small as possible , and hence the magnification of the infrared radiation as large as possible . in this case , because of the assumption that the emitted infrared energy distribution is independent of distance from the central heating source , the magnification is independent of wavelength .",

    "the reduction in the intrinsic luminosity of fsc10214 + 4724 to @xmath143 implied by the lens model of the source brings it into the luminosity range of previously studied infrared luminous agn .",

    "thus for the redshift estimate @xmath21 the present lensing model predicts properties typical of present day elliptical galaxies , except that the galaxy is unusually luminous .",
    "the probability of a large lensing galaxy is greater than the galaxy luminosity function alone implies , however , because the crossection for gravitational lensing is proportional to mass .",
    "analysis of statistically complete samples of radio galaxies suggests that the lensing rate ( i.e. probability that a given radio galaxy is lensed ) is on the order of @xmath163 ( miralda - escud & lehr 1992 , myers et al .",

    "the existence of a single lensed object in the surveyed area ( @xmath167  sr - rowan - robinson 1991 ) with magnification 30 should , according to these probabilities , represent an underlying population of @xmath168 compact , @xmath169m - luminous objects per square degree ( or @xmath170 per square degree at @xmath171 confidence ) which are either not lensed or lensed with much lower magnification ( and hence are not in the fss catalog ) .",

    "terminology is our component  2 . ) because the angular resolution of the three data sets ranges from @xmath14@xmath188 , the combined spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is somewhat uncertain .",
    "given the good agreement of the surface brightness profile for component  2 with a de vaucouleurs law ( figure 3 ) it is reasonable to assume that this component is an elliptical galaxy .",
    "for comparison , the unevolved spectrum of a standard bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) elliptical galaxy model at an age of 13 gyr and redshifts of 0.42 , 0.90 , 1.32 , and 2.286 is plotted in figure 6(a ) ; the corresponding passively evolving model with ages of 7.75 , 5 , 3.75 , and 2.2 gyr at these redshifts ( the ages are consistent with a present age of 13 gyr with the assumed cosmology ) is plotted in figure 6(b ) .",
    "all models were normalized to the @xmath11 flux in the sed for component  2 .",
    "clearly the @xmath16 models fail to match the observed sed for component  2 , while the @xmath21 models provide surprisingly good fits to the observations .",
    "this is fairly strong evidence that component  2 is in fact a foreground elliptical : it is too blue to be an elliptical galaxy at the redshift of fsc10214 + 4724 .",
    "the @xmath49 data point for component 3 is anomalously bright , while the rest of its sed is somewhat redder than component  2 .",
    "this might be due to a combination of reddening and star formation associated with the tidal interaction suggested in section  [ morphology ] , placing component  3 at the same redshift as component  2 , as the adopted model in section  [ model ] assumes .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath147 sed models appear to fit component  3 at least as well as the @xmath21 models . without the constraint of an elliptical surface brightness profile , it is much more difficult to assign a unique redshift based on the sed for component  3 than for component  2 . putting component  3 at @xmath147",
    "implies a higher lensing mass , for a constant mass - to - light ratio , and the result is a decrease in the mass and ellipticity of component  2 by of order 10% .",
    "component  4 is significantly bluer than components  2 and 3 , consistent with what appears to be a later type morphology .",
    "since the surface brightness profile of component 2 strongly suggests it is an elliptical galaxy ( section  [ profiles ] and figure 3 ) , it is possible to make further use of the surface brightness profile to estimate the redshift of component  2 using the fundamental plane relations for ellipticals ( kormendy and djorgovski 1989 ) . using @xmath189 and @xmath190 within @xmath40 from figure 3 , the present day equivalent blue surface brightness of component 2",
    "was calculated by correcting for @xmath191 surface brightness dimming , redshift k - correction , and luminosity evolution .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath192 ( in kpc ) and @xmath193 ( the average blue surface brightness within @xmath192 ) as a function of the assumed redshift for component 2 , overlaid on the data for present day ellipticals from sandage and perelmutter ( 1990 ) .",
    "luminosity and k - corrections are shown for both a non - evolving and passively evolving elliptical model spectrum from bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "redshifts near zero , or in the range 0.6 to 1.2 can be accomodated . from figure 4 ,",
    "the lens model predicts a central mass - to - light ratio @xmath194 for @xmath195 , arguing against low values .",
    "we consider the passively evolving model more realistic , leading to an estimate of @xmath196 .",
    "this estimate is independent of @xmath197 because the present day data scale in the same way as the calculated values .",
    "the estimate is driven almost entirely by the @xmath191 dependence of surface brightness on redshift , and is relatively independent of @xmath198 because the latter primarily affects angular size , which is nearly orthogonal to redshift in the region of interest in figure 7 .",
    "the main uncertainty is due to luminosity evolution ( some of which arises from the dependence of timescales on @xmath198 ) and to the scatter in surface brightness among giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "much of this scatter is correlated with the velocity dispersion , and if @xmath199 is known the @xmath200 relation ( lynden - bell et al .",
    "1988 ) can be used to measure the angular diameter distance for giant elliptical galaxies . here",
    "@xmath201 is defined as the angular diameter of the circle within which the integrated rest frame blue surface brightness is 20.75 mag arcsec@xmath47 after correction for luminosity evolution and @xmath191 surface brightness dimming .",
    "the value of @xmath199 is found from the lens model as plotted in figure 4(a ) .",
    "an advantage of @xmath201 over @xmath192 is that @xmath201 is defined at a higher surface brightness level , and is therefore smaller than @xmath192 and more immune to uncertainties about emission at the arc radius , as well as being less sensitive to uncertainties in sky subtraction .",
    "however the technique is sensitive to @xmath198 because it is essentially an angular diameter distance .",
