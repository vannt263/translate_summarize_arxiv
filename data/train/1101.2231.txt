    "experimental data on pb - pb collisions at @xmath0 tev from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) by the alice collaboration have recently become available  @xcite . for most central collision bins ( @xmath2 ) , the mid - pseudorapidity density of charged particles",
    "was found to be @xmath3  @xcite , which is a factor of @xmath4 higher than that observed in central au - au collisions at @xmath5 gev from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "this multiplicity density was reproduced by the hijing2.0 model with a more modern set of parton distribution functions  @xcite and has helped to constrain the gluon shadowing parameter in the model  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the elliptic flow in non - central collisions was found to have values similar to those in collisions at rhic energies  @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the similarity between the elliptic flows at lhc and rhic is consistent with the predictions of the viscous hydrodynamic model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this similarity has further led to the conclusion that the specific viscosity @xmath6 of the quark - gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions at lhc has a similar value as in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the observed elliptic flow at lhc can also be described by a kinetic model with a short - lived parton stage but strong final - state hadronic scatterings  @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , adding final - state scatterings , which are essential for generating the observed elliptic flow  @xcite , to the hijing model as implemented in a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model  @xcite would reduce the predicted charged particle multiplicity at mid - rapidity as a result of their appreciable contribution to the longitudinal work  @xcite .",
    "it is thus of interest to study both the multiplicity and elliptic flow in pb - pb collisions at @xmath0 tev by using the ampt model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ampt ] , we briefly review the ampt model and discuss its parameters . we then study in sec .",
    "[ multiplicity ] the multiplicity and in sec .",

    "the ampt model is a hybrid model with the initial particle distributions generated by the hijing model  @xcite of the version @xmath7 . in the version of string melting , which is used in the present study ,",
    "hadrons produced from the hijing model are converted to their valence quarks and antiquarks , and their evolution in time and space is then modeled by the zpc parton cascade model  @xcite with the differential scattering cross section @xmath8 in the above , @xmath9 is the standard mandelstam variable for four momentum transfer , @xmath10 is the strong coupling constant , and @xmath11 is the screening mass in the partonic matter . after stopping scattering ,",
    "quarks and antiquarks are converted via a spatial coalescence model to hadrons , which are followed by hadronic scatterings via the art model  @xcite .    in previous studies of heavy ion collisions at rhic ,",
    "some of the parameters in the hijing model were varied in order to reproduce the measured charged particle multiplicity .",
    "specifically , instead of the values @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev@xmath14 used in the hijing model for the lund string fragmentation function @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the light - cone momentum fraction of the produced hadron of transverse mass @xmath17 with respect to that of the fragmenting string , the values @xmath18 and @xmath19 gev@xmath14 were used in the ampt model  @xcite .",
    "also , the values @xmath20 and @xmath21 or @xmath22 @xmath23 , corresponding to a total parton scattering cross section of @xmath24 or @xmath25 mb , were used for the parton scattering cross section in the ampt model to describe measured elliptic flow   @xcite and two - pion correlation functions   @xcite . in the present study of heavy ion collisions at lhc",
    ", we again vary the values of these parameters to fit measured data .",
    "as shown below , a reasonable description of the measured charged particle multiplicity density at mid - pseudorapidity is achieved if the default hijing values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev@xmath14 are used in the lund string fragmentation function .",
    "also , a smaller qcd coupling constant @xmath26 and a larger screening mass @xmath27 @xmath23 , corresponding to a smaller ( @xmath28 mb ) but more isotropic parton scattering cross section , are needed to reproduce the observed elliptic flow .",
    "tev and centrality of @xmath2 from the ampt model with string melting for larger string tension ( filled pentagons ) and for smaller string tension with a parton scattering cross section of @xmath24 mb ( filled stars ) or @xmath28 mb ( filled squares ) . ]",

    "it is seen that the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 gev@xmath14 , that correspond to a larger string tension in the lund string fragmentation function , gives a larger multiplicity density at mid - pseudorapidity than that from the default hijing values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev@xmath14 that correspond a smaller string tension in the fragmentation function .",
    "the multiplicity density is , however , not sensitive to the parton scattering cross section @xmath31 . for the smaller value of @xmath32 , which is required to reproduce the measured elliptic flow at lhc as shown later in sec .",
    "[ v2 ] , the resulting charged particle multiplicity of @xmath33 at mid - pseudorapidity obtained with the default hijing parameters for the string fragmentation function is consistent with the measured data by the alice collaboration . in the following , we will thus use , unless stated otherwise , those parameters that correspond to the smaller values of string tension and parton cross sections in the ampt model for our study .",
    "we note that in obtaining the relation between the centrality @xmath34 and the impact parameter @xmath35 , we have used the empirical formula @xmath36  @xcite with the nucleus - nucleus total inelastic cross section @xmath37 @xmath38 calculated from the glauber model .",

    "[ dndeta ] , turning off the final - state partonic and hadronic scatterings in the ampt model enhances the charged particle pseudorapidity distribution .",
    "the charged particle multiplicity at mid - pseudorapidity is now @xmath41 , which is essentially the value from the hijing1.0 model  @xcite and is about @xmath1 higher than that with the inclusion of final - state scatterings , which is shown by filled squares .",
    "the value is reduced to @xmath42 after including partonic scatterings , and this shows that the charged particle pseudorapidity distribution is much more sensitive to partonic than hadronic scatterings .     on the number of participants in pb - pb collisions at @xmath0 tev from the ampt model with string melting and from the alice data  @xcite . ]",
    "figure [ dndetacen ] displays the dependence of the charged particle multiplicity density at mid - pseudorapidity ( @xmath43 ) per 1/2 participant , @xmath44 , on the number of participants .",

    "the abundance of pions is the largest at all @xmath46 except at intermediate @xmath46 where the proton yield becomes comparable .",
    "a similar phenomenon was observed in heavy ion collisions at rhic  @xcite , and it was attributed to the enhanced production of baryons from quark coalescence  @xcite .",

    "the latter is likely due to an overestimated non - flow effect in the ampt model .",
    "we note that a satisfactory understanding of elliptic flow of high-@xmath46 particles in heavy ion collisions at rhic is still lacking  @xcite .",
    "using the larger parton scattering cross section of @xmath24 mb , corresponding to a larger strong coupling constant ( @xmath20 ) and a smaller screening mass ( @xmath21 @xmath23 ) as used in describing the elliptic flow at rhic , would lead to a larger elliptic flow ( filled stars ) than the alice data .",

    "it is seen that the results from the ampt model ( open circles ) are consistent with the experimental data ( filled squares ) except for central and peripheral collisions where they are slightly larger and somewhat smaller , respectively .",
    "the smaller elliptic flow for centralities larger than @xmath48 is likely related to the softer @xmath46 spectrum in the ampt model . in the lower panel of fig .",

    "interestingly , the elliptic flow is larger for kaons than for pions .",
    "the above results from the ampt model for heavy ion collisions at lhc were obtained with different values for the parameters in the lund string fragmentation function and in the parton scattering cross section from those used for heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 gev@xmath14 used at rhic for the lund string fragmentation function correspond to a string tension that is about @xmath59 larger than that for @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev@xmath14 used in the present study .",
    "a smaller string tension at lhc is consistent with the fact that the matter formed at lhc is hotter and denser than that at rhic .",
    "the higher temperature reached at lhc also makes it possible to understand , according to the lattice results  @xcite , the smaller qcd coupling constant and the larger screening mass needed to describe the elliptic flow at lhc .",
    "we can compare the property of the quark - gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions at lhc with that at rhic by considering the ratio of its shear viscosity and entropy density , i.e. , the specific viscosity . in the kinetic theory ,",

    "the resulting specific viscosity is thus @xmath70    the initial temperature of heavy ion collisions in the ampt model can be estimated from the average energy density of mid - rapidity partons at their average formation time , which is about @xmath71 gev/@xmath72 at lhc and @xmath73 gev/@xmath72 at rhic . using @xmath74 for the baryon - free quark and antiquark matter",
    ", we obtain an initial temperature of about @xmath75 mev at lhc and about @xmath76 mev at rhic .",
    "the value of @xmath6 in the early stage of the quark - gluon plasma formed in these collisions , when most of the elliptic flow is generated , is thus about @xmath77 at lhc and @xmath78 ( for @xmath21 @xmath23 ) or 0.114 ( for @xmath79 @xmath23 ) at rhic .",
    "we note that for fixed values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 , which is the case in the ampt model , the value of @xmath6 as given by eq .",
    "( [ vis ] ) increases as the temperature of the quark - gluon plasma decreases . in a more realistic description ,",
    "the screening mass depends on temperature , i.e. , @xmath80 with @xmath81  @xcite . in this case , the ratio @xmath6 becomes independent of temperature .",
    "it is then of great interest to extend the ampt model to determine the screening mass from the qcd coupling constant and the local temperature of the partonic matter as in ref .",
    "@xcite and use the resulting model to study if using the same qcd coupling constant @xmath10 or same specific viscosity @xmath6 in the ampt model would describe the elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions at both rhic and lhc , as in the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite based on the hydrodynamic model .",
    "we have used the ampt model with string melting to study pb - pb collisions at center of mass energy @xmath0 tev .",
    "we have found that the measured multiplicity density and elliptic flow of charged particles at mid - pseudorapidity can be reasonably described by the model if the parameters in the lund fragmentation function are taken to be those used in the default hijing model and that a smaller but more isotropic parton scattering cross section than that used for heavy ion collisions at rhic is used .",
    "as at rhic , the final - state partonic and hadronic scatterings were found to be important as they would reduce the charged particle multiplicity density at mid - pseudorapidity by about @xmath1 .",
    "the smaller parton cross section needed to describe the measured elliptic flow at lhc than at rhic has led to a larger estimated @xmath6 in the quark - gluon plasma produced at lhc than that at rhic . however , this result may be due to the use of constant screening mass in calculating the parton scattering cross section .",
    "taking into account the medium dependence of the screening mass may reduce this difference .",
    "furthermore , the transverse momentum spectra and the centrality dependence of the multiplicity and elliptic flow have been studied and they are roughly consistent with the alice data . we have also made predictions for the multiplicity distributions and elliptic flows of identified hadrons such as protons , kaons , and pions .",
