    "<S> general mimo interference networks , named b - mac networks , which is a combination of multiple interfering broadcast channels ( bc ) and multiaccess channels ( mac ) . two related optimization problems , maximizing the minimum of weighted rates under a sum - power constraint and minimizing the sum - power under rate constraints , are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the first approach takes advantage of existing efficient algorithms for sinr problems by building a bridge between rate and sinr through the design of optimal mappings between them so that the problems can be converted to sinr constraint problems . </S>",
    "<S> the approach can be applied to other optimization problems as well . </S>",
    "<S> the second approach employs polite water - filling , which is the optimal network version of water - filling that we recently found . </S>",
    "<S> it replaces almost all generic optimization algorithms currently used for networks and reduces the complexity while demonstrating superior performance even in non - convex cases . </S>",
    "<S> both centralized and distributed algorithms are designed and the performance is analyzed in addition to numeric examples .    , mimo , interference network ,    [ [ section ] ]      he optimization under rate constraints for general multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) interference networks , where each transmitter may send data to multiple receivers and each receiver may collect data from multiple transmitters . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the network is a combination of multiple interfering broadcast channels ( bc ) and multiaccess channels ( mac).@xcite@xcite as special cases we assume gaussian input and that each interference is either completely cancelled or treated as noise . </S>",
    "<S> a wide range of interference cancellation is allowed , from no cancellation to any cancellation specified by a valid binary _ coupling matrix _ of the data links . </S>",
    "<S> for example , simple linear receivers , dirty paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite at transmitters , and/or successive interference cancellation ( sic ) at receivers may be employed .    </S>",
    "<S> two optimization problems are considered for . </S>",

    "<S> it is possible to obtain global csi if the base stations are allowed to exchange csi , making the relevant . in ad hoc or large networks </S>",
    "<S> , we have to design distributed optimization algorithms with local csi .      * </S>",
    "<S> * * * @xcitewhich means that if a set of sinrs is achievable in the forward links , then the same sinrs can be achieved in the reverse links when the set of transmit and receive beamforming vectors are fixed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , optimizing the transmit vectors of the forward links is equivalent to the much simpler problem of optimizing the receive vectors in the reverse links . * *    considering interference cancellation and encoding / decoding order , the * fop * and * spmp * for mimo bc / mac have been completely solved in @xcite by converting them to convex weighted sum - rate maximization problems for mac .    </S>",
    "<S> steepest ascent algorithm for the weighted sum - rate maximization a high complexity algorithm that can find the optimal encoding / decoding order for miso bc / simo mac is proposed in @xcite that needs several inner and outer iterations . </S>",
    "<S> a heuristic low - complexity algorithm in @xcite finds the near - optimal encoding / decoding order for * spmp * by observing that the optimal solution of * spmp * must be the optimal solution of some weighted sum - rate maximization problem , in which the weight vector can be found and used to determine the decoding order .      </S>",
    "<S> in summary , the * fop * and * spmp * for mimo b - mac networks have been open problems . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the paper is as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> * _ rate - sinr _ _ conversion _ : one of the difficulties of solving the problems is the joint optimization of beamforming matrices of all links . one approach is to decompose a link to multiple single - input single - output ( siso ) streams and optimize the beamforming vectors through sinr duality , if a bridge between rate and sinr can be built to determine the optimal number of streams and rate / power allocation among the streams . in section [ sec : rate - sinr ] , we show that any pareto rate point of an achievable rate region can be mapped to a pareto sinr point of the achievable sinr region through two optimal and simple mappings that produce equal rate and equal power streams respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of this result is that it offers a method to convert the * _ sinr based algorithms _ : using the above result , we take advantage of existing algorithms for sinr problems to solve * * * * * another approach is to directly solve for the beamforming matrices . for the convex problem of mimo mac , steepest ascent algorithm </S>",
    "<S> is used except for the special case of sum - rate optimal points , where iterative water - filling can be employed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the b - mac network problems are non - convex in general and thus , better algorithms , like water - filling , than the steepest ascent algorithm is highly desirable . </S>",
    "<S> however , directly applying traditional water - filling is far from optimal @xcite . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we recently found the long sought optimal network version of water - filling , polite water - filling , which is the optimal input structure of any pareto rate point , not only the sum - rate optimal point , of the achievable region of a mimo b - mac network . </S>",
    "<S> this network version of water - filling is polite because it optimally balances between reducing interference to others and maximizing a link s own rate . </S>",
    "<S> the superiority of the polite water - filling is demonstrated for weighted sum - rate maximization in @xcite and the superiority is because it is hard not to obtain good results when the optimal input structure is imposed to the solution at each iteration . in section [ sub : itree ] , using polite water - filling , we design an algorithm to monotonically improve the output of the sinr based algorithms for itree networks defined later , if the output does not satisfy the kkt condition . furthermore , in section [ sub : pr - pr1 ] , purely polite water - filling based algorithms are designed that have faster convergence speed . * _ distributed algorithm _ : in a network , it is highly desirable to use distributed algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> the polite water - filling based algorithm is well suited for distributed implementation , which is shown in section [ sub : distributed - implementation ] , where each node only needs to estimate / exchange the local csi but the performance of each iteration is the same as that of the centralized algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> * _ _ optimization of encoding and decoding order__s : another difficulty is to find the optimal encoding / decoding order when interference cancellation techniques like dpc / sic are employed . </S>",
    "<S> again , polite water - filling proves useful in section [ sub : orderoptimization ] because the water - filling levels of the links can be used to identify the optimal encoding / decoding order for bc / mac and pseudo - bc / mac defined later .    </S>",
