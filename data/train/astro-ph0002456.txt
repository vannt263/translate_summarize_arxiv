    ", we present a comprehensive set of intensities for 56 h@xmath0 near- and mid - infrared lines we observed with the iso - sws .",
    "these observations trace populations of energy levels ranging from @xmath101015  k to 43000  k. the redundancy of the h@xmath0 level determinations provides information on the average gas excitation along the line of sight over an unprecedented range .",
    "this sheds new light on the possible excitation mechanisms in the irc2 outflow .",

    "the h  ii region in the foreground of omc-1 contributes to the h recombination and ionic fine structure emission , whereas the pah ( verstraete et al .",

    "the shocks dominate the emission of h@xmath0 , h@xmath0o and co , and may make a minor contribution to the h recombination and most fine structure emission .",
    "all molecular hydrogen lines , due to the small radiative transition probabilities , remain optically thin .",
    "therefore the corresponding `` observed '' upper level column density can be computed from the observed line flux , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the observed line flux and the einstein-@xmath29 radiative transition probability of the transition from level @xmath30 to @xmath31 , respectively .",

    "the transition energies we computed from level energies kindly provided by e. roueff ( 1992 , private communication ) .    a convenient way to visualize the level column densities is to divide them by the level degeneracy @xmath32 , and plot this against the upper level energy @xmath33 ; the degeneracy @xmath34 , where @xmath35 for ortho ( odd @xmath36 ) h@xmath0 and @xmath37 for para ( even @xmath36 ) h@xmath0 . for the lines we observed toward peak 1 we found that in such a `` boltzmann diagram '' fig .",
    "[ fig : boltz1 ] the level columns show a smooth distribution , where the level columns line up irrespective of their quantum numbers .",
    "there is no sign of fluorescent excitation or of a deviation from the ortho - to - para h@xmath0 ratio of three .",

    "fluorescently excited @xmath1 , as seen in photodissociation regions ( timmermann et al .",
    "@xcite ) would produce a level distribution in which the `` rotational temperature '' derived from levels at given @xmath38 is lower than the `` vibrational temperature '' derived from levels of the same @xmath36 ( e.g. draine & bertoldi @xcite ) .",
    "fluorescent excitation therefore shows a characteristic jigsaw distribution of the @xmath39 levels , unlike the smooth line - up we observed here , where @xmath40 appears not to depend on the state quantum number .",
    "furthermore , fluorescently excited gas usually shows ortho - to - para ratios in vibrationally excited levels smaller than the total ortho - to - para ratio of the gas along the line of sight .",
    "this is due to the enhanced self - shielding , and therefore reduced excitation rate , of the more abundant ortho - h@xmath0 ( sternberg & neufeld @xcite ) .",
    "the shocks emitting the strong infrared lines in the omc-1 outflow are deeply embedded in the molecular cloud , so that the emerging radiation suffers significant extinction . to correct the column densities derived from the h@xmath0 emission line intensities , @xmath41 , for this extinction , we need to know the proper extinction correction as a function of wavelength . however , this interstellar infrared extinction curve is not well determined . especially the depth and width of the silicate absorption features , centered at 9.7  @xmath42 m and 18  @xmath43 are uncertain , and they could vary from region to region ( draine @xcite ) .",
    "a further complication arises from the mixing of the emitting and absorbing gas , which we might expect in the outflow regions considering the complex spatial variation of the near - ir emission mapped in omc-1 ( fig .",
    "[ schultz ] ) , or in similar outflows such as dr21 and cep a ( davis & smith @xcite ; goetz et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    with enough redundancy in the information provided by the molecular and atomic lines in peak  1 , we are in principle able to estimate the average extinction along our line of sight as a function of wavelength .",
    "however , the h  i recombination lines and the h@xmath0 emission lines may not be tracing the same regions , and might therefore be subject to differing extinction .",

    "[ fig : boltz1 ] derived from the line intensities ( _ uncorrected _ for extinction ) shows that the column densities follow a smooth distribution , with no dependence on vibrational quantum number , and no sign of an ortho - to - para column density ratio different from three .",
    "transitions from a given state to different lower states produce lines with different wavelengths which suffer extinction .",
    "deviations from the expected line ratios of lines from the same state therefore yield the difference in extinction between the corresponding wavelengths of the lines .",
    "more generally , we can use this to estimate the extinction as a function of wavelength for a large set of lines , by minimizing the dispersion in the excitation diagram around a least - squares fit to the level columns .",
    "we thereby assume that the dispersion in the column densities is partly due to extinction .",
    "we constructed an extinction curve ( fig .",
    "[ extinction ] ) with four free parameters : the absolute normalization for a @xmath46 power law extinction curve from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , the width and depth of the water ice absorption feature at 3.1@xmath49 m , and the depth of the @xmath50 m silicate absorption feature .",
    "we fixed the width of the 9.7 and @xmath51 silicate features from calculations by draine & lee ( @xcite ) .",
    "the depth of the 18@xmath52 m feature was taken to be 0.44 times that of the 9.7@xmath53 feature , based on an average of previous estimates ( draine & lee @xcite ; pegourie & papoular @xcite ; volk & kwok @xcite ; bertoldi et al . in prep",
    "calibration uncertainties and a small contribution of foreground fluorescently excited h@xmath0 may give rise to a dispersion in the derived extinction corrections that is not due to extinction .",

    "the depth of the extinction minimum at 6.5  @xmath9 m is very uncertain , since it is not constrained by the inconsistent corrections derived from the four lines between 5.8 and 7.3  @xmath9 m .",
    "there is an indication that the minimum is at least as deep as our simple curve shows , but a much more careful analysis of the line fluxes would be necessary to reach a firm conclusion",
    ".    atomic hydrogen recombination lines could offer another means to trace the extinction as a function of wavelength .",
    "we detected seventeen h  i recombination lines ranging in wavelength from 2.6 to 19  @xmath3 .",
    "since the relative emissivities are known from theory ( storey & hummer @xcite ) and depend only mildly on the gas temperature and density , a comparison of the observed line intensities divided by their respective case b emissivities yields a measure for the differential extinction between the respective lines wavelengths .    in fig .  [ recom ]",
    "we plot against wavelength the observed line intensities , divided by their emissivities and normalized to this ratio for the h  i 85 transition line .",
    "the data points scatter around unity , which means that there is little if any differential extinction over this wavelength range .",
    "a comparison with the distribution of intensities expected for an extinction curve with the shape we found from the h@xmath0 lines reveals none of the prominent extinction features .",
    "a reasonable explanation is that the total extinction to the h  i emission region is very low , @xmath65 mag .",
    "although the errors are too large to constrain the exact value of the extinction , it is obvious that the h recombination lines are much less attenuated than the h@xmath0 lines .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the atomic hydrogen emission arises in the foreground h  ii region , whereas the @xmath1 emitting region is more deeply embedded in the molecular cloud .",
    "this conclusion agrees with the assessment of everett et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who obtained @xmath66  mag for the extinction shown by h recombination lines , but found @xmath67  mag from the h@xmath0 lines . with a @xmath68 extinction law",
    "this corresponds to @xmath69  mag and @xmath70  mag , in good agreement with our results .",
    "the observed atomic and ionic fine structure lines are valuable diagnostics .",
    "if highly - ionized species are found toward the shocked region  which is well shielded from the ionizing radiation of the trapezium stars  they would indicate the presence of fast , ionizing j - shocks .",
    "it is therefore interesting to disentangle the respective contributions to the fine structure line emission of the foreground h  ii region / pdr and the shocked gas of the omc-1 outflow .",

    "it appears necessary to combine at least two shock models , one to account for the high - excitation level populations , one for the low - excitation levels .",
    "for example , combining two models from kaufman & neufeld ( @xcite ) , with shock velocities of 20 and 40 km  s@xmath203 , and beam filling factors of 1 and 0.026 , respectively , can well match the level population up to @xmath633 k ( fig .  [ excit ] , kn96 ) ; a pre - shock h@xmath0 number density of @xmath634 was adopted .",

    "molecular hydrogen is expected to be destroyed in shocks with velocities larger than 30 to 50 km s@xmath203 , depending on the magnetic field strength .",

    "[ [ bow - shocks ] ] bow - shocks : + + + + + + + + + + +    it has been suggested that the h@xmath0 emission arises in bow - shocks , in which the effective shock velocity decreases from the tip to the wake .",
    "the shock speed at the apex may be high enough to produce a dissociative j - shock here .",
    "but further down the wake , non - dissociative c - type shocks can prevail , with peak temperatures in the shocked molecular layers that decrease steadily down the wake . thereby a large range of temperatures for the molecular gas exists in a single bow shock .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the existence of bow - shocks is also supported by the observation of double - peaked velocity profiles for isolated regions in the outflow ( chrysostomou et al .",

    "it is difficult to understand how the high velocity excited h@xmath0 can be produced in a bow shock which is produced , e.g. , by a dense bullet which is moving through a medium initially at rest .",
    "ambient gas which has passed through parts of the bow shock which are not strong enough to dissociate the h@xmath0 will not be accelerated to velocities much larger than 30 km s@xmath203 , unless the magnetic field is very strong .",
    "if alternatively the bow shock arises from a molecular wind impinging on a dense obstacle , then the problem arises how the molecular wind was accelerated to over 100 km s@xmath203 without destroying the molecules , and why we do not see a lot more mass , traced by co , e.g. , at such high velocities .",
