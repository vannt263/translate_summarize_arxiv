    "low - dimensional and gapped quantum magnets based upon strongly coupled spin pairs or dimers with weaker interdimer interactions have become especially topical systems . this is primarily due to the relevance of experimentally accessible quantum critical points @xcite . for antiferromagnetic intradimer exchange , the ground state of such systems is a product of singlets , but strong magnetic fields can close the spin - gap to excited triplet states via zeeman splitting of the triplet @xcite .",

    "the examination of temperature dependent scattering intensity indicates that both singlet - triplet and triplet - quintet excitations are observed in the ins spectrum ( there is no ins cross - section for @xmath0 antiferromagnetic singlet - quintet excitations ) .",
    "based upon the relative energy scales of the two observed excitations , we can estimate the mean energy of singlet - quintet excitations as @xmath169  mev .",
    "single - crystal ins measurements may be able to determine the dispersion associated with thermally activated triplet - quintet excitations or perhaps observe multi - particle excitations , quintet - triplet decay or interference of single- and multi - particle excitations @xcite .",
    "the existence of singlet - quintet and triplet - quintet excitations may also be able to explain the heat capacity above @xmath170  k  which can not be accounted for by single excitation models@xcite .",
    "we also point out that the currently determined exchange constants may be able to further describe the magnetic field dependent phase diagram at low - temperatures or place limits on the nature of the proposed long - range - ordered phases .",
    "the difference between the observed phase diagrams for @xmath171 and @xmath172 must be related to the single ion anisotropy term in the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] .",
    "as we will show elsewhere@xcite , this term induces an effective exchange anisotropy in the low - energy hamiltonian that results from projecting the original hamiltonian into the subspace generated by the singlet and @xmath173 triplet of each dimer .",
    "these two states can be described with a pseudospin 1/2 variable .",
    "the combined effect of geometric frustration and anisotropy leads to the appearance of a new phase for @xmath174 that will be discussed in ref .  .",
