    "quantum dot ( qd ) , a tiny engineered device accommodating a single electron or a few ones in three - dimensionally confined space , acts not only as a crucial ingredient for the realization of solid state quantum computation but also as a convenient tool to explore the effect of strong correlation manifested by discrete energy levels .",
    "very rich phenomena , such as resonant tunneling , coulomb blockade and the kondo effect , arise in different circumstances to intrigue experimentists and theorists . to address the phase coherence of the transport , the qd or qds",
    "are embedded in various aharonov - bohm ( ab ) geometries . till now single dot @xcite or double dots @xcite in two - terminal ab interferometer",
    "have been realized in experiments and the current oscillation of magnetic flux has been observed .        in this paper , we consider two quantum dots parallely connected to two metallic reservoirs with magnetic flux penetrating the enclosed area .",
    "due to the complexity of this system , most of the previous research concentrated on the noninteracting case to give the exact and general results of transport and to find effects of magnetic flux , position and difference of qds energy levels , and band widths of coupling strength @xcite .",
    "there were only a few thoretical studies of the interacting systems , which focused either on intradot correlation with spin for two identical dots @xcite , or on interdot correlation without spin for two different dots @xcite , or on the case having large intradot and interdot correlation without spin for two identical dots @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite is an exception where the intradot and interdot coulomb repulsion , spin configuration and disparity of two dot levels were discussed at zero temperature covering the strong coupling kondo regime .",
    "the present paper also deals with intradot and interdot coulomb correlation , spin configuration and level disparity but is concerned with the coulomb blockade regime at temperatures higher than the kondo temperature .    for the description of quantum transport through double - dot system ,",
    "the `` classical '' rate equations must be modified for nondiagonal density matrix elements responsible for transitions between isolated quantum states @xcite . recently",
    "a modified quantum equations have been derived @xcite to study the transport of an interacting system using the slave - boson technique introduced by zou and anderson @xcite and incorporating the nonequilibrium green s functions .",
    "the solutions are equivalent to the lowest - order gradient expansion , which is a good approximation for sequential resonant tunneling @xcite , and essentially accordant with previous analyses . utilizing this kind of quantum rate equations ,",
    "one is able to discuss the coulomb correlation effect at arbitrary temperature . in the present paper ,",
    "we apply this method to analyze a double - dot ab interferometer with interdot and intradot coulomb repulsion , considering the lowest - order of the dot - lead coupling strength in transport .",
    "the hamiltonian of two tunneling coupled quantum dots parallely connected to left and right leads with the presence of magnetic flux is described by the genetic tunneling model : @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators of electrons in the dots @xmath8 and in the left and right leads ( @xmath9 ) with spin @xmath10 .",
    "each dot has a single spin degenerate orbital level @xmath11 and an infinite on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath12 and simultaneously there is an arbitrary finite interdot electrostatic correlation @xmath13 between them .",
    "we only consider the two dot levels are very close to each other , @xmath14 , with a small variation @xmath15 .",
    "the effect of ab flux @xmath16 is taken into account in the tunneling amplitude @xmath17 by @xmath18 with the flux quantum @xmath19 . in the peierls gauge ,",
    "one generally chooses @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21th lead is supposed to be fermi liquids in equilibrium state and has the same coupling strength function with two dots @xmath22 .    according to the slave - particle approach originated by zou and anderson , we introduce auxiliary operators @xmath23 to stand for the possible states of two dots as a whole : empty state @xmath24 , singly occupied state @xmath25 , and doubly occupied state @xmath26 respectively . in the slave - boson representation",
