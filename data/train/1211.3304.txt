    "three dimensional su(3 ) gauge theory has many properties in common with qcd .",

    "it can therefore be expected that from this model one obtains important information about the mechanism of confinement and the deconfinement transition in qcd .",

    "these results are in quite good agreement with lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to measure the string tension at finite temperature and the value of the critical temperature , because the analytic calculations should eventually be extended to these observables .    in a series of papers @xcite",

    "we have shown that in the high temperature phase above approximately @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the critical temperature , the theory can be dimensionally reduced to a gauge - higgs model in two dimensions , by which one can give an excellent description of the long distance properties of the full theory .",

    "one should remark , however , that there are analytic calculations for a general fluctuating bosonic string , which in three dimensions give universal values for the terms in the expansion in @xmath19 up to @xmath20 @xcite . not only do these terms , of course , coincide with those from the development of the formula in nambu - goto string model to this order , but their contribution is practically indistinguishable from the full model up to @xmath21 .",

    "the dashed line is the string model value in eq .",
    "( [ tcstring ] ) . ]    as can be seen in fig .",
    "6 the data show clearly that the leading correction to the continuum value in ( [ tcsigmafit ] ) has to be quadratic in @xmath130 as expected for a ratio between physical quantities .    in the nambu - goto string model , the temperature dependent string tension",

    "( [ string1 ] ) shows that the approach to @xmath13 corresponds to the mean field critical exponent @xmath24 .",
    "it is quite astonishing that the measured value ( [ tcsigma ] ) for @xmath0 is so close to the theoretical one ( [ tcstring ] ) , in particular as we have shown that there is a scaling region , where the mean field behaviour of the string model is not valid . in principle",
    "it would be interesting to investigate if the prediction ( [ tcstring ] ) becomes better in @xmath11 for larger values of @xmath160 .",

    "7 we have plotted @xmath170 vs @xmath171 . in the region near the transition , we only use the largest volume for each @xmath40 , and further restrict to those cases where @xmath172 in which case the corresponding points lie along the dashed line in fig .",

    "7 must , however , be aware of the scaling region near the phase transition .",
    "in this article we have presented results for the behaviour of three dimensional @xmath0 gauge theory near the finite temperature phase transition .",
    "we have introduced a new and powerful application of finite size scaling to extract the value of the critical coupling . for this purpose ,",
    "we have used the third power of the polyakov loop , which evolves smoothly over the transition . to extract @xmath108",
    "we assume the critical exponents of the two dimensional three state potts model , which are expected to be valid because of universality arguments @xcite . employing this method ,",
    "we have determined the critical coupling on considerably larger lattices both in space and temperature direction than in earlier investigations .    that the phase transition is in the universality class of the abovementioned potts model is strongly supported by our finite size scaling analysis of the mass gap and the susceptibility .",
    "their values were extracted from an analysis of the correlation function of the polyakov loop in fourier space .",
    "we used our measured critical couplings and these correlation functions at a large set of values of the spatial extension and the coupling constant near the transition . in this region all the data for the mass gap fall within errors on a unique scaling curve , if we assume the critical exponent @xmath1 to be that of the potts model .",
    "this test is sensitive to the exponent @xmath1 only .",
    "a further check of the universality , which is sensitive to the exponent @xmath54 was performed for the susceptibility in the disordered phase .",
    "also in this case the data fall on a single scaling curve when we use the expected value @xmath139 .",
    "this is not the case if we e.g. assume the mean field value @xmath77 .",
    "this analysis was performed for @xmath117 and @xmath17 with consistent results .",
    "finally we have used our values for the critical couplings for @xmath115 and @xmath177 and the zero temperature string tension determined at these values from an interpolation formula of data in the literature to make an extrapolation to the continuum and obtain the ratio of the critical temperature to the square root of the zero temperature string tension .",
    "we have compared this ratio to the corresponding result in the nambu - goto string model .",
    "although the string model predicts a temperature dependent string tension which has mean field behaviour in the scaling region , the critical temperature in this model is , in fact , very close to the lattice result . the ratio is a non perturbative and non universal observable .",
    "thus it is a very important result , which may imply that the string model describes the spectrum and the multiplicities of the excited states of the @xmath0 gauge model in three space - time dimensions .",
    "the simulations were done on the shiva computing cluster at faculty of physics , astronomy and applied computer science jagiellonian university and also on zeus cpu and gpu cluster at academic computing centre cyfronet in krakow and on gpu cluster at bielefeld university .",
