    "the outcomes of these calculations were tested against increasing the dimension of the krylov subspace ( @xmath86 ) and by comparing them to the results obtained using a direct method in smaller vibrational hilbert spaces .",
    "we distinguish two different parameter regimes depending on the relative magnitudes of dot - lead ( @xmath87 ) and inter - dot couplings ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "first , a strong inter - dot coupling regime where the coupling between the sites is much stronger than between the dots and the leads ( @xmath88 ) and second , a weak inter - dot coupling regime where the opposite is true ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "we will describe the transport properties in both these regimes in the following subsections .",
    "in this section we study a double quantum dot system that is weakly coupled to the source and drain electrodes ( as compared to inter - dot coupling @xmath2 ) .",
    "figure [ figure2a ] shows the @xmath90 characteristics for such a system . for simplicity",
    "we consider a completely symmetric case such that @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "as expected , the system with strong inter - dot coupling behaves similarly to a single quantum dot ( single - site molecular junction ) coupled to a vibrational mode .",
    "the onset in the @xmath90 trace occurs when the chemical potential of the source electrode is equal to the polaron - shifted energy of the left dot @xmath94 .",
    "the current through the system then increases in a stepwise manner as consecutive vibrational levels fall within the bias window .",
    "the peaks in the differential conductance are separated by @xmath95 and the relative heights of these steps can be explained qualitatively by considering the values of the @xmath96 elements ( accounting for the franck - condon overlap between the vibrational groundstate and the @xmath97 vibrational excited state)@xcite .    unlike in the case for a single - site molecule , however , the phase difference in the electron - phonon coupling constant between the sites can result in an overall current suppression , especially for low vibrational levels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2a ] .",
    "it is important to stress that the incoherent hopping ( on and off the leads ) is independent of the phase of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the reason the transport is retarded in the presence of phase difference in electron - phonon coupling between the sites can be explained as follows : when the two sites couple to the vibrational mode with the same phase ( so that @xmath98 or a multiple thereof ) the factor @xmath99 in the inter - dot coupling hamiltonian @xmath100 [ see eq .  ] becomes an identity operator on the vibrational space , @xmath101 .",
    "this means that coherent transitions between the sites take place without any vibrational excitations .",
    "however , if the sites couple to the vibrational mode with different phases this is no longer the case and the coherent evolution within the dqd will be accompanied by phonon emission .",
    "higher vibrational states produced in such a way will then be less efficient in tunnelling out to the leads due to poorer franck - condon overlap leading to an overall suppression of the current .",
    "interestingly , at large bias voltage , the trend can reverse such that coupling in antiphase results in a marginally higher current .",
    "there , the higher vibrational states are formed during incoherent hopping of an electron from the leads onto the dqd and the coherent transition between the sites can increase the populations of lower - lying vibrational states",
    ". however , this subtle effect may be difficult to observe in practical situations .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2b ] , the populations on the two sites are equal independently of the applied bias and of phase difference in the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this should come as no surprise given that the two sites are strongly coupled and the system is entirely symmetric .",
    "current at bias voltage @xmath102 ( first step in the current - voltage characteristics ) .",
    "the calculation was performed for a symmetric system : @xmath103 ev .",
    "the energy of the vibrational mode was taken to be @xmath104 ev , the electron - phonon coupling constants @xmath105 ev , the coupling between the sites , and the leads is @xmath106 ev and the temperature was assumed to be 10 k. ]    let us now consider the dependence of the current through the molecule ( at the bias voltage @xmath102 ) on the strength of inter - site coupling @xmath2 in the limit @xmath107 . in the case of @xmath108",
    "the transport is virtually independent of @xmath2 as it is limited by incoherent hopping rates @xmath109 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "however , as discussed above , when @xmath63 is nonzero the internal dynamics of the system becomes relevant . for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , increasing the strength of the inter - site coupling @xmath2 leads to a reduction of current .",
    "this surprising result can be understood by recalling that for nonzero @xmath63 the coherent transition between the sites ` produces ' higher vibrational states which then lead to the observed current suppression .",
    "the stronger the coupling @xmath2 , the greater the degree of vibrational excitation which accumulates before the electron tunnels out into the leads .",
    "finally , let us stress that one should expect this parameter regime ( where the inter - dot coupling @xmath2 is stronger than the coupling to the leads ) to be appropriate in the case of most single - molecule junctions@xcite .",
    "the strength of the electron - phonon coupling in these systems is often estimated experimentally by considering the relative heights of the franck - condon steps@xcite .",
    "as shown above , one has to be careful in using the same approach for two- or multiple - site systems , where the phase difference in electron - phonon coupling becomes relevant .",
    "another surprising conclusion from the presented results is that the intramolecular dynamics can quite significantly affect the transport properties of the studied system in this parameter regime , despite the fact that the transport efficiency is limited by hopping between the leads and the molecular system .",
    "let us now consider the reverse situation , that is , when the two dots are weakly coupled to each other but interact with the electrodes more strongly ( this parameter regime can be realised in cnt double quantum dots , see for example ref .  ) .",
    "as we will now discuss , this case delivers very different and much richer physical phenomena .",
    "once again , we shall first focus on a symmetric system . as before , when there is no phase difference in the vibrational coupling between the sites",
    ", one observes a stepwise increase in the current through the system , see fig .",
    "[ figure4a ] .",
    "this can again be explained by vibrational effects in the tunnel coupling between the sites and the leads .",
    "even though the bottleneck in the transport is the coherent hopping between the sites , vibrational effects in connection with incoherent hopping on ( and off ) the molecule will play an important role as long as the hopping rates @xmath109 and inter - site coupling @xmath2 are comparable .    moving on to the case of nonzero @xmath63",
    ", we can see that a difference in phase between the electron - phonon coupling elements still induces a current suppression .",
    "in addition , the phase difference leads to negative differential conductance  a decrease in current with increasing bias voltage . in this parameter regime",
    ", it is the inter - site transition that limits the overall transport rate .",
    "hence , what is crucial now is how the phase difference in electron - phonon couplings affects the @xmath112 transition .",
    "it turns out that this transition is suppressed for nonzero @xmath63 , resulting in the observed current suppression , and is even less efficient for higher vibrational states ( as discussed below ) , giving rise to the negative differential conductance shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4a ] .    since it is the coherent hopping between the sites that is the rate - limiting step in the overall charge transport , the populations of the two sites are no longer equal ( fig .",
    "[ figure4b ] ) . in the case of @xmath108",
    ", populations of the two sites increase with the applied bias voltage .",
    "however , if the sites couple to the vibrational mode with different phases , an increase in @xmath73 is accompanied by a decrease in the population of the right site ( correlating with the current through the dqd ) .",
    "this demonstrates a rather different physical origin of observed effects as compared with the ones reported in section [ sec : level31 ] ( _ c.f .",
    "[ figure2b ] ) .    to understand the origin of the ndc in more detail , let us now consider transport through the two - site system for different values of electron - phonon coupling constant .",

    "this can be qualitatively related to the magnitudes of the diagonal elements of the @xmath99 operator ( fig .",
    "[ figureaa ] in appendix [ appc ] ) . as can be seen in eq .",
    "the displacement operators affect the overall efficiency of the coherent hopping between the sites .",
    "one can notice that the maximum current occurs at bias voltage for which the vibrational level @xmath115 , corresponding to the largest @xmath116 matrix element enters the bias window ( compare fig .",
    "[ figure5a ] and fig .",
    "[ figureaa ] ) .",
    "the relative magnitudes of the steps in the current - voltage characteristics can not be , however , as easily correlated with values of @xmath117 .",
    "the observed value of current is a result of a complex interplay between vibrational effects during hopping on and off the dqd and the dynamics within the system .",
    "it is interesting to consider the value of current at the first step of the @xmath90 trace ( at @xmath118 ) as a function of @xmath114 and @xmath63 , see fig .",
    "[ figure5b ] .",
    "two overlapping effects become apparent : firstly , a decrease in transport efficiency as the electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath114 ) increases - this is fundamentally an example of the franck - condon blockade@xcite . secondly , the current decreases as the difference in phases of electron - phonon coupling @xmath63 deviates from 0 ( or @xmath119 ) - the effect described and explained above .",
    "finally , let us consider a case in which the energy levels of the two sites are detuned ( for example due to an asymmetric structure of the molecule or an applied gate voltage ) .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics for this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "introducing an energy gap between the sites decreases the current through the dqd as it decreases the efficiency of @xmath112 transition .",
    "moreover , for a considerable detunning between the sites the ndc , observed in @xmath91 case , is lifted .",
    "now , higher vibrational states ( on the left site ) are in fact more efficient in tunnelling from the left to right site , especially into lower vibrational states ( on the right site ) .",
    "thus , increasing the bias voltage ( coinciding with increasing populations of higher vibrational levels ) leads to an overall increase in the current through the dqd .",

    "in this paper , we have derived a quantum master equation that can account for a transport through a two - site molecular system ( or a carbon nanotube double quantum dot ) that is coupled to a single vibrational mode .",
    "the method used here is perturbative and relies on a born - markov approximation with respect to lead - dot coupling but , unlike most previous studies of similar model systems , treats electron - phonon interactions exactly . using it we have demonstrated that , depending on the phase difference in electron - phonon couplings @xmath63 , one can observe current suppression and/or negative differential conductance in transport through the studied system .",
    "the role of @xmath63 in vibrationally coupled charge transport remained , thus far , largely unexplored .",
    "we have also explained the physical origin of the observed effects by analysing the derived quantum master equation as well as considering the bias voltage - dependence of the on - site populations . for simplicity ,",
    "we have mostly limited our discussion to symmetric systems with @xmath93 and @xmath125 .",
    "considering asymmetry may well be necessary to account for future experimental observations , however , it is a trivial modification to our model presented in this work . we would also expect to observe similar effects to the ones described here ( current suppression and ndc in relevant parameter regimes ) in systems where @xmath126 even in the absence of phase difference in electron - phonon coupling constants .",
    "once again , these would be caused by vibrational excitations or suppression of the @xmath112 transition .",
    "the phenomena described here are non - equilibrium effects and can naturally be lifted by very fast damping of the vibrational mode .",
    "fast relaxation of the harmonic oscillator will bring the vibrational states of the system back to their ground state ( at least at sufficiently low temperature ) diminishing the current suppression and ndc effects described in this work .",
    "vibrational relaxation times in cnt quantum dots and molecular junctions can be , however , quite long , as it has been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "one also has to bear in mind that in real systems the electronic degrees of freedom are typically coupled to more than one vibrational mode .",
