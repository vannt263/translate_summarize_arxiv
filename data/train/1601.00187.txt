    "molecular medium in front of bright background continuum sources can often be observed as absorption lines , allowing us to make sensitive studies of physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in various environments , including quiescent and translucent molecular media in the milky way , dense molecular gas in the vicinity of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and the ism in the early epoch of the universe .",
    "in fact , because the absorption line depths are independent of the distance to the absorption system , they offer a very powerful technique to uncover cold molecular gas in the distant universe , which is often difficult to observe in emission unless it is intensely heated by either star - formation or active nuclei .",
    "since the first cosmological detection of such molecular absorption system toward pks 1413 + 135 at @xmath3 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* curran  2011 ) ) .",
    "another important case is a molecular absorption system in which absorption occurs near an agn , i.e. , presumably in the putative dense obscuring tori around agns .",
    "for instance , centaurus a is known to exhibit strong absorption line features seen in both molecules ( e.g. , co and hco@xmath1 ) and neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* espada  2010 ) ; see also ott  in this volume ) . however , the number of such systems , which are believed to originate from such @xmath5pc scale tori , is very small again .",
    "ngc 4261 is another example showing nuclear absorption lines in both co and hi ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jaffe & mcnamara 1994 ) ) but recent sensitive search for mm - wave absorption features using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) and the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) yields no significant detections of either co(1 - 0 ) or co(2 - 1 ) , giving very small optical depths for these transitions ( @xmath6 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* okuda  2013 ) ) .",
    "such molecular absorption lines are also observed in the diffuse medium within the galaxy against the background extragalactic continuum sources .",
    "this also gives an important way to unveil `` dark '' molecular medium , i.e. , invisible in emission because they are often in the equilibrium with the background radiation .",
    "currently , the number of such extragalactic continuum sources with known galactic molecular absorption lines is limited to @xmath530 .",

    "again we need to expand the sample of galactic absorption systems with such rare species to obtain a comprehensive picture of the diffuse molecular media within the galaxy , but a survey of new molecular absorption systems is always very time consuming and entails a significant risk of non - detection .",
    "* ando  ( 2015 ) ) propose using the alma archive to search for new molecular absorption systems in mm / submm wavelengths , because the alma archive already offers a vast number of sensitive mm / submm spectra of extragalactic continuum sources , i.e. , bandpass and/or visibility calibrators , which are essentially radio - loud quasars including bl - lac objects . because of the enormous improvement in sensitivity provided by alma , these calibrators in the alma archive are potentially ideal _ free lunch _ in the quest for molecular absorption systems from the galaxy to the high-@xmath8 universe without any new investment of observing time !",
    "they analyzed 36 calibrator sources in the alma archive to create 3d cubes and search for any absorption features .",
    "this resulted in four new detections of absorption line features , and three of which are found to be newly detected galactic absorption systems .",
