    "in @xcite e.witten argues that the large @xmath0 expansion of the @xmath1 chern - simons theory on a 3-manifold @xmath2 should be equivalent to an open string theory on @xmath3 . in the absence of knots ( wilson loops ) the latter",
    "is supposed to describe pseudoholomorphic curves ( strings ) on @xmath3 with boundaries on the zero section . when knots are present h.ooguri and c.vafa suggested that curves should additionally be allowed to end on conormal bundles to them .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately",
    ", ordinary gromov - witten theory on @xmath3 is trivial since there are no non - trivial pseudoholomorphic curves there .",
    "neither closed surfaces nor surfaces ending on the zero section or a conormal bundle may be pseudoholomorphic due to a vanishing theorem in @xcite ( see remark  [ r:1 ] ) .",
    "one way around this proposed by e.witten himself is to use some degenerate ` curves ' ( fat - graphs ) but it is unclear how to formalize such a theory ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "another way around this difficulty was proposed by r.gopakumar and c.vafa in @xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "the idea is to change the topology of @xmath5 so that gromov - witten theory on the resulting manifold is non - trivial and still equivalent to the chern - simons theory on @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting manifold in this case is the @xmath7 bundle over @xmath8 and it can be obtained from @xmath5 by shrinking the @xmath6-cycle to a point and then inserting an @xmath9 in its place .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 chern - simons theory on @xmath6 is predicted to be dual to the gromov - witten theory on @xmath10 .",
    "this is the gopakumar - vafa conjecture .",
    "the midpoint in the transition is a singular variety @xmath11 called the conifold and the change from @xmath5 to @xmath10 is called the conifold transition . in the physical literature @xmath5",
    "is referred to as the deformed conifold and the resulting @xmath10 bundle @xmath12 as the resolved conifold .",
    "schematically , @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the contraction map and @xmath15 projecting to @xmath16 ( see section  [ s:1 ] for details ) .",
    "we note that @xmath17 is defined on @xmath18 so the dashed arrow is almost well - defined and @xmath19 is the exceptional @xmath9 .",
    "as the @xmath6-cycle represented by the zero section in @xmath5 shrinks the open curves that end on it become closed and then get lifted to @xmath12 .",
    "although this picture has no mathematical meaning , note that unlike @xmath5 the resolved conifold @xmath12 does admit non - trivial closed holomorphic curves and one can talk about equivalence or duality between the chern - simons on @xmath6 and the gromov - witten on @xmath12 . in the case of closed curves",
    "it was verified by a direct computation in @xcite .",
    "when knots are present the geometric part of the gopakumar - vafa conjecture predicts that the conormal bundle to a knot undergoes the conifold transition and produces some lagrangian submanifold @xmath20 in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "then the chern - simons theory with knot observables ( wilson loops ) on @xmath6 has to be dual to the open gromov - witten theory where the curves end on @xmath21 .",
    "ooguri and vafa were able to produce @xmath21 explicitly in the case of the unknot using antiholomorphic involutions .",
    "this is a trick that does not generalize to any other knots . for this case",
    "the conjecture has been verified in @xcite using some narrow definitions of open gromov - witten invariants .",
    "later j.labastida , m.mario and c.vafa offered a way to construct lagrangians for algebraic knots , in particular torus knots @xcite .",
    "this construction as explained by c.h.taubes @xcite begins with producing a two - dimensional lagrangian surface in @xmath22 that intersects spheres of large radii along the given knot .",
    "then this surface is translated with twisting along the fibers of @xmath12 over the equator of @xmath8 completing a half - twist after the full circle ( analogous to the mbius strip considered as a bundle over the circle ) . to match up the ends the original surface in @xmath22 must be centrally symmetric which imposes a restriction on admissible knots .",
    "taubes came up with a generalization to non - algebraic knots and links but the rather artificial symmetry restriction remained .",
    "in particular , it excludes something as simple as the trefoil knot .",
    "the main flaw of this construction though is that the lagrangian submanifold constructed is entirely unrelated to the conormal bundle in @xmath5 it is supposed to come from .",
    "our approach in contrast will be to obtain the corresponding lagrangians directly by applying the conifold transition to the conormal bundle @xmath23 of a knot @xmath24 . as a result the manifold @xmath21 is produced for all knots in a uniform way and without restrictions . however , this approach presents its own difficulties . since @xmath23 intersects the zero - section of @xmath5 which is being shrunk into the conifold singularity , it also acquires a singularity in the process . in general this singularity",
    "is not resolved by subsequent lifting to @xmath12 .",
    "the intuitive idea held by physicists ( e.g. , c.vafa ) is that one needs to perturb @xmath23 into @xmath25 disconnected from the zero - section and only then perform the conifold transition to get @xmath26 .",
    "the problem is that @xmath23 is an exact lagrangian and there is an obstruction to disconnecting it from the zero section by a symplectic isotopy .",
    "it was discovered originally by m.gromov for compact submanifolds @xcite and then generalized to non - compact ones by y .-",
    "oh using the floer homology @xcite .",
    "however , a smooth disconnecting isotopy can easily be found .",
    "the construction is very straightforward .",
    "let @xmath27 be a naturally parametrised knot .",
    "embed @xmath6 into @xmath28 in the standard way then the embedding of @xmath29 into @xmath30 is also standard .",
    "the conormal bundle to @xmath24 is realized as @xmath31 to disconnect @xmath23 from the zero - section we shift it in the fibers of @xmath5 in the direction tangent to the knot , namely @xmath32 since @xmath33 misses the conifold singularity the conifold transition is given simply by @xmath34 the transition @xmath26 turns out to be a smooth submanifold in @xmath12 and has the correct topology @xmath35 .",
    "predictably , it fails to be lagrangian in the standard khler structure of the resolved conifold .",
    "we beleive however that this is a false problem .",
    "although the standard khler structure on @xmath12 is the simplest one it is not in any way special from the physical point of view . the physically significant structure , if any , is the one induced by the calabi - yau metric .",
    "the calabi - yau metric on @xmath12 is known almost explicitly @xcite but no attempt has been made to check if even the ooguri - vafa submanifold for the unknot is lagrangian in it .",
    "moreover , the computations of open invariants in @xcite only use the fact that it is lagrangian in the standard metric on the resolved conifold . on the other hand",
    ", one does not need a necessarily lagrangian submanifold to build a theory of open holomorphic curves .",
    "it suffices to have a totally real submanifold @xcite with some uniformity conditions in non - compact cases @xcite .",
    "conifold transitions of perturbed conormal bundles constructed in this paper do meet these conditions .",
    "moreover , one can show that the moduli of holomorphic curves ending on these submanifolds are compact and thus suitable for defining open gromov - witten invariants ( theorem  [ t:5 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s:1 ]",
    "we briefly review the conifold transition and introduce a natural notion of the conifold transition for submanifolds of @xmath5 . in section  [ s:2 ]",
    "we compute explicitly the conifold transitions of the conormal bundles to the unknot and torus knots . in the former case",
    "we get the well - known ooguri - vafa lagrangian @xcite , while in the latter a variety which is neither smooth nor lagrangian . in section  [ s:3 ]",
    "a perturbed conormal bundle is defined and we prove that its conifold transition is a tame lagrangian in @xmath12 ( see definition  [ d:5 ] ) . in section  [ s:4 ]",
    "we lay the geometric groundwork for the compactness result in section  [ s:5 ] .",
    "namely , we use the technique of second fundamental forms and bi - lipschitz maps to prove that the resolved conifold has bounded geometry , i.e. its sectional curvature is bounded from above and the injectivity radius is bounded from below .",
    "the key point is lemma  [ l:10 ] which formalizes the idea that the conifold has cone - like geometry .",
    "finally , in section  [ s:5 ] the moduli spaces of open curves are introduced following @xcite and the compactness of the moduli of curves ending on @xmath26 is proved . in the end",
    "we present our conclusions",
    ".    * acknowledgements .",
    "* the author would like to thank d.auckly without whose advice and encouragement this paper would never have been completed .",
    "i am also grateful to m.liu for patiently explaining to me the theory of open gromov - witten invariants and c.vafa and m.mario for suggesting the construction of perturbed conormal bundles",
    ". main ideas of this paper were discussed during the program symplectic geometry and physics at the institute of pure and applied mathematics in march - june 2003 and the workshop interaction of finite type and gromov - witten invariants at the banff international research station in november 2003 .",
    "it is my pleasant duty to thank all their organizers and participants .",
    "in this section we first review some basic facts about the conifold transition @xcite and fix the notation used throughout the paper .",

    "equivalently , one can think of it as @xmath5 with the singular form @xmath48 that degenerates along the zero section .",
    "the manifolds @xmath42 or equivalently @xmath49 are called the * deformed conifolds*. the parameter @xmath50 has a simple geometric interpretation as the radius of the 3-sphere @xmath51 in @xmath42 , i.e. , of the zero section . as @xmath50 goes to @xmath52 this sphere collapses into the singular point in @xmath11 .",

    "@xmath611 for all @xmath164 , @xmath612 , but @xmath613 clearly does not have gromov convergent subsequences ( fig.8 ) .    the additional property which is missing here is some kind of convexity of @xmath21 at @xmath614 that would force pseudoholomorphic curves to be anchored to a compact subset . in terms of theorem  [ t:4 ]",
    ", there is no compact subset in @xmath22 that all @xmath615 meet .    in our case , anchoring to a compact subset follows from a simple observation below that generalizes the vanishing theorem of witten ( see remark  [ r:1 ] ) .",
    "despite the simplicity it implies that all relevant pseudoholomorphic curves in the resolved conifold must intersect its zero section .",
    "let @xmath2 be a manifold with an almost complex structure @xmath201 and an exact @xmath616-form @xmath102 which is symplectic and tames @xmath201 on @xmath617 . if @xmath618 is an exact lagrangian submanifold then any non - constant pseudoholomorphic curve , closed or ending on @xmath21 , intersects @xmath619 .",

    "thus the non - empty intersection granted by lemma  [ l:16 ] is a purely symplectic phenomenon that does not follow from a dimension count in differential topology .",

    "whether the submanifolds constructed in this paper are suitable for the gopakumar - vafa conjecture remains to be seen .",
    "in addition to compactness one also needs the open curves moduli to have virtual dimension zero @xcite . for open curves ending on a lagrangian submanifold",
    "this is traditionally ensured by the special lagrangian condition @xcite : the imaginary part of the holomorphic volume form vanishes along the submanifold . since the holomorphic volume form on a calabi - yau is nowhere zero this means in particular , that its real part does not vanish along the submanifold .",
    "the special lagrangian condition is far from being necessary .",
    "it suffices to have it satisfied only cohomologically : the maslov class @xcite of the submanifold should be trivial .",
    "the last condition makes sense for totally real submanifolds as well as for lagrangian ones .",
    "it holds for example if the real part of the holomorphic volume form does not vanish .",
    "away from the zero section the holomorphic volume form for the resolved conifold can be obtained by deforming the one for the cotangent bundle .",
    "one can see that the real part of the latter is uniformly separated from zero along the conormal bundles to knots . for this reason we beleive that non - vanishing along their conifold transitions can be proved by a perturbation argument akin to the one used for the symplectic form in section  [ s:3 ] .",
    "assuming that the maslov class is zero one still needs to compare the gromov - witten invariants to the chern - simons knot invariants .",
    "a computational approach used so successfully for comparing the closed invariants @xcite does not seem to be feasible beyond the case of the unknot @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the circle symmetry of the unknot is lacking in general and the standard localization techniques do not apply .",
    "it seems more likely that a proof will come from a deformation argument relating the gromov - witten theory on the resolved conifold to a degenerate string theory on the cotangent bundle postulated by witten @xcite .",
