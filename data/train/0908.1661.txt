    "transport properties of brownian particles in suspensions are of great interest for all technological applications involving complex fluids such as food technology or oil recovery and they have been studied extensively experimentally ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath0 of a spherical tracer particle with radius @xmath1 in a simple solvent is to a good approximation given by the stokes - einstein relation @xmath2 with the solvent viscosity @xmath3 and the thermal energy @xmath4 .",
    "as demonstrated , e.g. , for the case of a tracer sphere in solution of polymers @xcite , the naive approach to replace the pure solvent viscosity with the macroscopic shear viscosity @xmath5 of the polymer solution ( as measured in a viscosimeter ) in general fails .",
    "the polymer solution in the vicinity of the moving sphere is not homogeneous . even in equilibrium one",
    "observes depletion layers or density oscillations ( depending on the interaction potentials between the polymers and between the polymer and the particle ) . in the vicinity of a moving particle , the flowing solvent rearranges the polymers leading to an enhanced polymer density in - front and a reduced polymer density behind the particle @xcite , which leads to an enhanced friction @xcite , and to long - ranged solvent mediated effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the time scale for the build - up of these inhomogeneities in the solution in the vicinity of the moving particle is given by the diffusivity of the polymers and the particle size .",
    "for most systems this time scale is well separated from the corresponding microscopic time scale of the solvent @xcite , but rather close to the time scale of the particle diffusion ( given by the particle size and its diffusion constant in the pure solvent ) .    for such systems ,",
    "the mean square displacement is not linear in time and for the tracer particle one defines a time dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath6 via @xcite @xmath7 with the particle position @xmath8 at time @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 indicates the equilibrium ensemble average .",
    "the short and the long time limit of @xmath6 are called the short and long time diffusion coefficients @xmath11 respectively .",

    "once the sphere is in motion , the distribution of polymers in the vicinity of the tracer becomes anisotropic : it is more likely to find a polymer in front of the sphere than behind it , which reduces the mobility of the sphere . after a sufficiently long time , the polymer distribution becomes stationary and the velocity is related to the force via the long time mobility @xmath18 . in general @xmath19 .",

    "one main distinction between hard spheres and polymers is , that for hard spheres the hydrodynamic radius is equal to the particles radius , while for polymers , the effective hydrodynamic radius is in general smaller than the radius of gyration .",

    "the variation of @xmath156 over all @xmath128 is nevertheless rather weak ( about @xmath164% ) , which means that the generalized stokes - einstein relation is an acceptable approximation for all values of @xmath128 .",

    "the maximum of @xmath158 at @xmath166 is the result of two competing effects .",
    "with decreasing @xmath1 ( increasing @xmath128 ) the solvent flow field generated by the moving tracer is weaker and as a consequence the short time diffusivity increases , i.e. , @xmath141 and , according to eq .  , @xmath142 decrease .",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of bath particles around the tracer gets more disturbed since the weaker flow field can not transport the bath particles around the tracer such that these accumulate infront of the tracer , which reduces the tracer mobility @xcite . for very large @xmath128",

    "the long time diffusion coefficient for a tracer particle in a suspension of equal hard spheres is expected to be @xmath167 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our theory yields a slightly larger value @xmath168 since we neglect lubrication forces at small particle distances ( which are less important if the interaction radius is larger than the hydrodynamic radius , i.e. , for @xmath169 ) . for this reason @xmath142 for @xmath170 , while still beeing monotonic , shows the onset of a local maximum in our theory ( see fig .",

    "therefore a tracer particle is much less hindered in its motion by a suspension of equal sized polymers than by a suspension of equal sized spheres . because the polymer hydrodynamic radius is smaller than the hydrodynamic radius of the hard spheres , the tracer and the polymer interact less strongly via the solvent .    in order to test the accuracy of our results",

    "calculations with lower order approximations to the diffusion tensors ( @xmath183 or less ) do not yield the correct generalized stokes - einstein relation , eq .  .",
    "experimental values of the long time diffusion coefficient of tracer spheres in polymer solutions are often described empirically by a stretched exponential @xmath184 with a dimensional constant @xmath185 .",
