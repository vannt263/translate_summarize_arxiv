    "inspired by ultracold atomic physics , nuclear physics and color superconductivity , the fermion pairing between different species with mismatched fermi surfaces prompted great interest@xcite in recent experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "in conventional fermion superfluid the ground state is well described by the bcs theory , while for asymmetric fermion superfluid with double - species pairing the phase structure is much more rich and the pairing mechanism is not yet very clear .",
    "various exotic phases have been suggested in the literatures , such as the sarma phase@xcite , the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov(fflo ) phase@xcite , the phase with deformed fermi surfaces@xcite , and the phase separation@xcite in coordinate space .    for asymmetric fermion superfluid ,",
    "one of the most surprising phenomena is the magnetic instability , @xmath0 , when the asymmetry characterized by the chemical potential mismatch is larger than the condensate of cooper pair , the bcs superfluid is unstable under the perturbation of an external magnetic field .",
    "this instability leads to the ground state to be a fflo phase .",
    "for color superconductivity , a similar but more complicated phenomenon is also found , namely the chromomagnetic instability@xcite .",
    "one of the mechanisms to cure the magnetic instability is to introduce another pairing channel . in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple model including both double- and single - species pairings and investigate how the single - species pairing influences the fflo state .",
    "our model can be used to describe a general fermion superfluid system where fermions from the same species can form cooper pairs . in ultracold atom gas like @xmath1li and @xmath2k",
    ", there exist pairings between different elements and between different states of the same element@xcite . in color superconductivity phase of dense quark matter@xcite",
    ", the quarks of different flavors can form total spin zero cooper pairs and the quarks of the same flavor can combine into total spin one pairs too . in neutron stars@xcite , proton - proton ,",
    "neutron - neutron and neutron - proton pairs are all possible .",
    "recently discovered high temperature superconductivity of mgb@xmath3@xcite can also be well described by an extended two - band bcs theory where the electrons from the same energy bands form cooper pairs .",
    "we consider a fermion system containing two species @xmath4 and @xmath5 with masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 and chemical potentials @xmath8 and @xmath9 satisfying @xmath10 . the system can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\sum_{{\\bf p},{\\bf k}}\\left[\\frac{g}{2}\\sum_{\\sigma\\sigma'}\\hat a_{\\bf p}^{\\sigma+}\\hat b_{-{\\bf p}}^{-\\sigma+}\\hat b_{-{\\bf k}}^{-\\sigma'}\\hat a_{\\bf k}^{\\sigma'}+g_a\\hat a_{\\bf p}^{\\uparrow+}\\hat a_{-{\\bf p}}^{\\downarrow+}\\hat a_{-{\\bf k}}^\\downarrow\\hat a_{\\bf k}^\\uparrow + g_b\\hat b_{\\bf p}^{\\uparrow+}\\hat b_{-{\\bf p}}^{\\downarrow+}\\hat b_{-{\\bf k}}^\\downarrow\\hat b_{\\bf k}^\\uparrow\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fermion momenta , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the annihilation and creation operators , the coupling constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 are positive to keep the interactions attractive , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the non - relativistic dispersion relations , and in continuous limit we simply replace @xmath20 with @xmath21 . the ( pseudo-)spin @xmath22 has been introduced to keep our model satisfying the pauli rule explicitly . other inner structures like isospin ,",

    "the hamiltonian has the symmetry @xmath23 with the element @xmath24 defined as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in the framework of mean field approximation , after taking a bogoliubov - valatin transformation from fermions @xmath4 and @xmath5 to quasi - particles @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the thermodynamic potential can be expressed in terms of the quasi - particles , @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 are the corresponding @xmath4-@xmath4 , @xmath5-@xmath5 and @xmath4-@xmath5 pairing condensates , and @xmath31 are the quasi - particle energies with @xmath32/2,\\nonumber\\\\ \\left(\\epsilon_\\delta^2\\right)^2&=&\\delta^2\\left[\\left(\\epsilon_a-\\epsilon_b\\right)^2+\\left(\\delta_a-\\delta_b\\right)^2\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33 and @xmath34 correspond , respectively , to the spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 means the breaking pattern @xmath38 with the element @xmath39 defined as @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for simplicity , we have considered all the condensates as real numbers .    to study the fflo state , we modify the definitions of the fermion dispersions as @xmath42 with @xmath43 corresponding to spin - up and @xmath44 to spin - down , where @xmath45 are the fflo momenta of condensates of @xmath46 pairing , which together with the condensates are self - consistently determined by the coupled set of gap equations @xmath47 and the minimum thermodynamic potential .",
    "note that the fflo state we considered here is the simplest form where the cooper pairs in coordinate space have the plane wave forms @xmath48 we will choose @xmath49 , such a choice can avoid possible dynamic instability due to the different superflow velocities of @xmath50 and @xmath51 channels@xcite .",
    "obviously , the translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the fflo state are spontaneously broken . to have a simple analytical expression for the spectral of quasi - particles",

    "@xmath58 plays the role of an external magnetic potential @xmath59 .    in the end of this section",
    ", we calculate the gapless nodes for the case with zero fflo momentum where at least one of @xmath60 or @xmath61 crosses the momentum axis , @xmath62 there are two classes of gapless solutions .",
    "1 ) only @xmath63 is nonzero .",
    "the gapless mode happens at momenta @xmath64 where we have introduced the average chemical potential @xmath65 and the chemical potential mismatch @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear that the condition to have the gapless mode is @xmath67 .",
    "2 ) all the three condensates are zero or only one of @xmath68 and @xmath69 is nonzero . in these cases",
    ", we have @xmath70 or @xmath71 or @xmath72 which mean real fermion excitations exactly at the fermi surfaces .",
    "since the model is non - renormalizable , we introduce in the numerical calculations a cutoff @xmath73 with @xmath74 and the average fermi momentum @xmath75 . we choose @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 being the @xmath79-wave scattering lengths .",
    "we have checked that in the parameter region of @xmath80 and @xmath81 there is no qualitative change in the phase diagrams",
    ".     plane at fixed @xmath82 with @xmath83 being the symmetric gap at @xmath84 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the phase diagram in @xmath85 plane is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the upper panel is in the familiar case without single - species pairing@xcite .",
    "the homogeneous bcs state can exist at low temperature and low mismatch , and the inhomogeneous fflo state survives only in a narrow mismatch window .",
    "when the single - species pairing is included as well , see the bottom panel of fig.[fig1 ] , the inhomogeneous fflo state of @xmath4-@xmath5 pairing is eaten up by the homogeneous superfluid of @xmath4-@xmath4 and @xmath5-@xmath5 pairings at low temperature , just as we expected , and survives only in a small triangle at high temperature .",
    "the phase transition from the @xmath4-@xmath5 pairing superfluid to the @xmath4-@xmath4 and @xmath5-@xmath5 pairing superfluid is of first order .",
    "note that for systems with fixed chemical potentials there is no mixed phase of double- and single - species pairings , and the situation is similar to a three - component fermion system@xcite .",
    "we have investigated the phase structure of an asymmetric two - species fermion superfluid with both double- and single - species pairings .",
    "since the attractive interaction for the single - species pairing is relatively weaker , it changes the conventional phase diagram at low temperature . in any system with chemical potential imbalance ,",
    "the double - species pairing in fflo state is replaced by the single - species pairing . in the region with single - species pairing , the interesting gapless superfluid is washed out and all fermion excitations are fully gapped . we should note that in this paper we considered only the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "for the case of canonical ensemble , the phase diagram becomes much more rich@xcite .",
