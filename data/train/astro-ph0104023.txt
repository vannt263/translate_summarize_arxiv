    "large catalogs of galaxies with their redshift and angular positions are the major astronomical data sets which provide quantitative information on the distribution and formation of the universe . to properly decipher this information requires the use of statistical tools , and to assess their importance heavily relies on a quantitative comparison with theoretical models .    in a recent series of papers @xcite , various statistical quantities from the las",
    "campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) have been determined including the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) , @xmath17 , the power spectrum , @xmath18 , the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion ( pvd ) , @xmath19 , and the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , a detailed comparison between these observational results and the predictions of current cold dark matter ( cdm ) models has been carried out .",
    "jing , mo , & brner ( 1998 ; jmb98 hereafter ) have constructed 60 mock samples for each theoretical model from a large set of high - resolution n - body simulations.the observational selection effects can then be taken into account in the analyses of the theoretical models exactly as for the real observational data . jmb98",
    "have demonstrated at length that such a procedure is essential for the proper comparison between models and observations .",
    "jmb98 found that both the real - space 2pcf and the pvd can be measured reliably from the lcrs , and that the observed 2pcf for lcrs is significantly flatter than the mass 2pcf in cdm models on scales @xmath21 .",
    "the observed pvd also turned out to be lower than that of the dark matter particles in these models .",
    "jmb98 introduced a cluster - underweight ( clw ) biasing model to account for these discrepancies ; clw essentially assumes that the number of galaxies per unit dark matter mass in a massive halo of mass @xmath22 decreases as @xmath23 . if @xmath24 , the 2pcf and the pvd of the lcrs are well reproduced in a spatially - flat cdm model with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the density parameter of the model and @xmath27 is the current rms linear density fluctuation within a sphere of radius @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , @xcite argue that this anti - bias is at the level observed for rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "we note here that this clw has been applied also in recent analytic modeling of the galaxy distribution @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report on the measurements of the 2pcf and pvd of galaxies in another large redshift survey , the pscz catalog , which has become publicly available recently @xcite .",
    "since galaxies in the pscz survey are selected from the iras point source catalog , they are supposed to be preferentially dominated by late types in contrast to the lcrs galaxies .",
    "thus the difference of those clustering statistics between lrcs and pscz should be interpreted as an indication for the morphology - dependent biasing of galaxies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows ; we briefly describe the pscz sample and the corresponding mock samples from simulations in  2 .",
    "then we present the results for the 2pcf of the pscz in  3 which are compared with various model predictions in  4 .",
    "also shown there are the results for spiral _ galaxies _ predicted by the gif simulation @xcite .",
    "similarly we present in  5 and  6 the observational determination of pvd and its theoretical implications , respectively . finally ",
    "7 contains a summary and further discussion .",
    "the pscz survey @xcite contains the redshifts for galaxies selected from the iras point source catalog ( psc ; beichman et al .",
    "in total the pscz catalogue contains 15411 galaxies with their flux at @xmath29 exceeding @xmath30 across @xmath31 of the entire sky . the high sky coverage and the uniformity",
    "make this publicly available survey an ideal data set for the statistical studies of galaxy clustering .",
    "both those parts of the sky excluded from the survey and the selection function are well documented in @xcite . in the analysis",
    "below , we use a volume - limited sample of galaxies with redshifts less than @xmath32 according to the flux at @xmath33 and also all the galaxies with redshifts between @xmath32 and @xmath34 , resulting in a final semi - volume limited sample of @xmath35 galaxies .",
    "the volume - limited sample within @xmath32 should reduce the influence of the local supercluster on the statistics on small scales , thus minimizing possible bias from the local supercluster .",
    "the redshift selection function is the same as that given by @xcite for @xmath36 , is a constant for @xmath37 and zero for @xmath38 .",
    "we construct a large set of mock samples , which have the same survey geometry , selection function and sampling rate as the real pscz galaxies , from high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "we emphasize that this is a very important aspect of our analysis in asserting the statistical significance of the results .",
    "for this purpose , we mainly consider a spatially - flat model with ( @xmath26 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath27)= ( 0.3 , 0.7 , 0.2 , 1.0 ) simulated in a comoving boxsize of @xmath41 , where @xmath39 is the cosmological constant and @xmath42 is the shape parameter of the cdm power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we use three different realizations for each model employing @xmath43 17 million particles @xcite .",
    "this set of parameters is now considered as the _ standard _ low - density cdm model . jmb98",
    "have found that this model reproduces the 2pcf and the pvd of the lcrs reasonably well .",
    "an even better fit to the lcrs data was obtained for a model with @xmath44 .",
    "the changes for this model can be roughly seen by a simple scaling of the term @xmath45 which is proportional to the amplitude of the pvd . for reference",
    ", we also consider a @xmath46 _ standard _ cdm model simulated in a @xmath41 box as well as additional lcdm models in @xmath12mpc and @xmath14mpc to make sure that our conclusions are free from the numerical artifacts .",
    "the parameters for those simulation models are summarized in table  [ tab : simulation ] .",
    "the mock samples are generated in the same way as described in jmb98 , using the selection function from the pscz @xcite .",
    "we construct 20 mock samples for each realization , and thus altogether 60 mock samples for the lcdm model in a @xmath41 box . for each mock sample",
    "we apply the clw bias ( jmb98 ) .",
    "the clw model , by construction , gives less weight to the denser clusters than the dark matter model , and thus is especially appropriate for the pscz which is supposed to be dominated by spiral galaxies preferentially avoiding the high - density cluster regions . to be more specific ,",
    "we randomly select _ galaxies _ from the dark matter particles so that the number of galaxies per unit dark matter mass , @xmath47 , becomes proportional to @xmath48 within a halo of mass @xmath22 .",
    "we apply this anti - biasing scheme for all dark halos with @xmath49 . while the model with @xmath24 reproduces the 2pcf and the pvd for the lcrs data , we find ( see below ) that the pscz data require @xmath50 , indicating stronger anti - biasing than the optically selected galaxies .",
    "we also apply this same bias model to the scdm when we compare the predictions of this model to the observations .",
    "in addition , we also construct 20 mock catalogs from the gif data base @xcite for comparison to our models and to the data .",
    "the gif simulation adopts the same cosmological model , but with a slightly lower normalization of the linear power spectrum @xmath51 .",
    "the simulation box size is @xmath52 .",
    "the most important feature of the gif data is that a semi - analytic galaxy formation model is implemented in contrast to our biasing scheme entirely on the basis of the gravitational clustering .",
    "we select `` spiral galaxies '' from the gif mock samples according to their bulge - to - total luminosity ratio @xmath53 .",
    "about 80% of those mock galaxies at the low end of @xmath53 are retained for our analysis , taking into consideration the fact that the population of ellipticals is about @xmath54 that of spirals in the local universe .",
    "it might be more appropriate to select `` galaxies '' according to their infrared fluxes for the present purpose .",
    "fortunately , however , the clustering properties of iras galaxies do not sensitively depend on the infrared luminosity @xcite , nor do those of the gif spirals seem to depend sensitively on the ratio @xmath53 .",
    "thus our results below are fairly robust with respect to small changes in the population of galaxies .",
    "quite a number of large galaxy catalogs , both two - dimensional ( angular ) , and three - dimensional ( redshift ) catalogs , have been used to determine the 2pcf , and this statistic has now been established quite well .",
    "this statistic has produced constraints on theoretical models which are sensitive to the cosmological parameters , the initial power spectrum of the mass density fluctuations , and the biasing of specific galaxy types with respect to the dark matter , among others .",
    "we use the following estimator to measure the 2pcf @xmath55 in redshift space ; [ xizest ] _",
    "z(r_p,)&=&rr(r_p , ) dd(r_p , ) dr(r_p,)^2 - 1 , where dd is the count of galaxy - galaxy pairs in the projected separation @xmath56 and radial separation @xmath57 bins , rr and dr are similar counts of pairs formed by two random points and by one galaxy and one random point , respectively .",
    "we first display the redshift correlation function @xmath58 in figure  [ fig1 ] , which is the circular average of @xmath59 for a radius @xmath60 .",
    "the error bars have been estimated by the bootstrap resampling technique using the formula of @xcite . the resulting 2pcf is well fitted by @xmath61 for @xmath62 , but falls faster than the power - law on larger separations in good agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "here we focus our discussion on the projected 2pcf and the pvd @xcite , not only because these two statistics have not been determined for the pscz galaxies before as of the writing of this paper but also because they provide very useful independent information about the spatial and velocity distribution of iras galaxies which can be used to understand and test galaxy formation models .",
    "we estimate the projected 2pcf @xmath63 from the integrated redshift 2pcf as is a factor of two smaller than that of @xcite , for example . ]",
    "[ wrp ] w(r_p)=_0^_z(r_p,)d=_i_z(r_p,_i ) _ i , where the summation runs from @xmath64 to @xmath65 with @xmath66 . jmb98",
    "have shown that this method yields an unbiased estimate of @xmath63 which is also related to the real space 2pcf simply as [ wxi ] w(r_p)=_0^ ( ) dy . figure  [ fig2 ] plot the projected 2pcf for the pscz with error bars estimated again with the bootstrap resampling technique .",
    "our tests with the mock samples indicated that a standard scatter among different mock samples is actually comparable to these bootstrap errors .",
    "so we will use the bootstrap error for the observational estimates and the mock sample scatter for the comparison of the models with the observations .    if the real space 2pcf @xmath67 is approximated as a power - law of the form : [ xir ] ( r ) = ( r_0/r)^",
    ", then the projected 2pcf @xmath68 reduces to = ( r_0/r_p)^r_p , with @xmath69 being the gamma function .",
    "as figure [ fig2 ] indicates , the observed @xmath68 of the pcsz galaxies for @xmath70 is fitted to the above form reasonably well with [ plfit2 ] r_0 = 3.70 , = 1.69 .",
    "the slope is shallower and the amplitude is lower than those for the lcrs ( jmb98 ) .",
    "the error - bars are , however , substantially larger than for the lcrs , indicating that this catalog is somewhat noisier .",
    "the reason might be that the intrinsic clustering is weaker in this catalog and also that the volume surveyed by the catalog is smaller and in fact sparsely sampled .",
    "there is some indication for a deviation from the power - law between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , but it is not highly significant when considering the error - bars .",
    "the above best - fit parameters are in very good agreement with the result of the @xmath73 sample , @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] compares the projected 2pcf @xmath68 for the pscz galaxies with those for the mock samples .",
    "the clw bias model with @xmath76 reproduces the pscz data quite well within the @xmath77 error ( dotted lines ) ; even the wiggly structure of the pscz @xmath68 below @xmath72 is recovered .",
    "the value of @xmath78 larger than for the optically selected galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath24 for the lcrs ) is consistent with the observational density - morphology relation ; spiral galaxies preferentially selected by the iras pscz do not concentrate in dense cluster regions .",
    "moreover it is interesting that our clw bias model can account for this behavior in a quantitative manner , purely by an appropriate adjustment of the parameter @xmath78 .",
    "the scdm model , when the clw bias is applied , appears to underpredict clustering on scales of about @xmath79 , as many previous studies have already found .    to follow up this point a bit more ,",
    "we have also constructed mock catalogs from the gif simulation data @xcite . from the simulated catalogue ,",
    "we select those galaxies with @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the v - band magnitudes of the bulge and the whole galaxy .",
    "this encompasses about 80 percent of the galaxies in the gif catalog .",
    "the resulting @xmath68 again fits the observations quite well ( fig.[fig3 ] ) for @xmath83 .",
    "while the amplitude of @xmath68 for the gif simulation is a bit larger than the pscz data for @xmath84 , it still lies close to the @xmath85 error line of our clw mock samples .",
    "so these semi - analytic models of galaxy formation which incorporate physical processes like star formation and supernova explosions in some global way have a similar effect of reducing the number of galaxies per unit dark matter mass as our simple bias prescription .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] plots the 2pcfs in real space , @xmath67 , of the gif mock samples with different selection criteria , all of which follow a power - law @xmath86 quite nicely .",
    "while selecting galaxies on the basis of their @xmath87 reduces the 2pcf at @xmath88 compared with those for all galaxies , the two different criteria , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , result in almost identical 2pcfs despite the fact that the latter case selects only @xmath91 of the entire gif galaxies .    in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we display several 2pcfs for dark matter from our simulations , the clw mock samples with @xmath24 and @xmath92 , and the @xmath93 sample from the gif data set .",
    "clearly , as has been noted many times already ( see e.g. jmb98 ) , the dark matter particles from the full simulation produce a @xmath67 which is too large and too steep for @xmath94 . as for the lcrs galaxies , a scale - dependent bias is required for the lcdm model to be reconciled with the observed 2pcf of the pscz galaxies , which is consistent with the result obtained by hamilton & tegmark ( 2001 ) from an analysis of the real space power spectrum for the pscz galaxies .",
    "the clw bias model with @xmath24 that fits the lcrs data well still predicts a much higher amplitude of @xmath67 than the pscz data which are in good agreement with @xmath76 model .",
    "the gif spiral result lies between these two clw bias models , and is closer to that of @xmath76 at @xmath95 .",
    "we also note that the result of all gif galaxies is quite close to the clw model with @xmath24 .    in summary",
    ", we may conclude that one can reproduce the 2pcfs both for the pscz galaxies and for the optically selected lcrs galaxies in an lcdm model adopting a simple biasing prescription dependent on the type of galaxies in the sample , as long as the bias underweights galaxies in dense clusters .",
    "the semi - analytic gif models may be a step on the way to provide a physical interpretation to the phenomenological clw bias model .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion ( pvd ) of galaxies is a well - defined statistical quantity which contains interesting information in principle on the cosmic matter distribution .",
    "the peculiar velocities of galaxies are determined by the action of the local gravitational fields , and thus they directly mirror the gravitational potentials caused by dark and luminous matter ( juszkiewicz et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the pvd is measured by modeling the distortions in the observed redshift - space correlation function @xmath96 .",
    "the basic step in modeling is to write @xmath96 as a convolution of the real - space 2pcf function @xmath17 and the distribution function @xmath97 of the relative peculiar velocity @xmath98 of galaxy pairs along the line of sight @xcite : [ xizmodel ] 1+_z(r_p , ) = f(v_12)dv_12 .",
    "while the real - space 2pcf @xmath17 can be directly estimated by inverting equation ( [ wxi ] ) , we use the power - law fit ( [ plfit2 ] ) as in most previous work . for the velocity distribution function ,",
    "we use the following exponential form which is supported from observations @xcite , theoretical models @xcite , and direct simulations @xcite : [ fv12 ] f(v_12)=1_12 ( -_12 | v_12-| ) , where @xmath99 is the mean infall velocity and @xmath100 is the dispersion of the 1-d pairwise peculiar velocities along the line of sight .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the above modeling ( eqs .",
    "[ [ xizmodel ] ] and [ [ fv12 ] ] ) is an approximation and the infall velocity @xmath99 is not known _ a priori _ , either . jmb98",
    "demonstrated with the lcrs mock samples that the above procedure provides an accurate estimate of @xmath100 ( within 20% accuracy ) if @xmath99 is known separately .",
    "in other words , @xmath99 must be modeled carefully to allow a precise measurement of the dispersion @xmath19 . in reality",
    ", however , @xmath99 in the real universe is not fairly certain at the present .",
    "one might think that on small scales @xmath99 is negligible , but this is true only for very small scales indeed .",
    "the function @xmath99 rises quite sharply around @xmath101 @xcite , reaching twice the hubble velocity just beyond @xmath101 .",
    "therefore the proper modeling of the infall velocity is crucial in an accurate measurement of the pvd @xmath19 .",
    "here we adopt the approach of jmb98 to determine the pvd for the pscz catalogue .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] displays the result of this modeling both for the case of a self - similar infall and for zero infall .",
    "the self - similar infall model has the same parameters as those used in jmb98 , and is quite close to the mean pair velocity in cdm models with @xmath102 for the relevant scales @xmath103 . as emphasized in jmb98 , only the use of some reasonable infall model ( although the result is not very sensitive to the specific model used ) gives a reliable reconstruction of the pvd , whereas the zero infall case does not even qualitatively reproduce the true value .",
    "we therefore consider the result of the self - similar infall as a reasonable estimate for the pairwise velocity dispersion of the pscz galaxies .",
    "the procedure yields much lower pvd for the pscz than that for the lcrs : @xmath100 just reaches @xmath104 at @xmath105 , whereas @xmath106 for the lcrs ( jmb98 ) .",
    "this is again qualitatively consistent with the fact that spirals have smaller random motions than the galaxies that reside in big clusters .",
    "our result at @xmath107 is in good agreement with the value , @xmath108 , of fisher et al .",
    "( 1994b ) for the @xmath109 sample , although they did not show the scale - dependence of the pvd .    very remarkable in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "is the decrease of the pvd for small separations .",
    "the bootstrap errors in figure [ fig6 ] are quite substantial .",
    "again we find that the errors are much larger than for the lcrs .",
    "nevertheless it seems significant that the pvd decreases down to about @xmath110 near @xmath111 .",
    "in contrast the lcrs data did not exhibit such a fall - off , but rather the pvd stayed almost constant near @xmath4 .",
    "if we further take into account the observational error of redshifts ( typically @xmath112 ) and add it to the pvd measurement in quadrature , the real value becomes even smaller , @xmath113 at @xmath111 .",
    "the galaxy pairs in the pscz catalog are seemingly `` very cold '' ; they show very little random motion .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] compares the pvd for the clw and gif mock samples with that for the pscz galaxies . in all cases ,",
    "the model predictions significantly exceed the estimate for the pscz . only around @xmath114",
    "the disagreement is not serious , especially if the large error bars are taken into account .",
    "in fact , we may speculate that a cdm model with @xmath115 may even produce quite a good fit to the data at larger @xmath56 , since the amplitude of the pvd scales with @xmath45 . reducing the values of @xmath100 accordingly , brings agreement on scales larger than @xmath116 .",
    "there is , however , no way to reproduce the steep decrease towards small values ( @xmath117 ) at @xmath118 of the pscz data .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersions are rather similar in the scdm and in the lcdm models .",
    "this is really puzzling , because the lcrs galaxies do not show a signature like this . even taking into account the large error bars at small scales",
    ", we have to concede a formal @xmath119 deviation from the model results .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings of ostriker & suto ( 1990 ) , @xcite and @xcite , who found that the galaxies in the local neighborhood are very quiet and that the dispersion of galaxies in mild density regions are small compared with the cdm predictions ( also see peebles 1995 ; nolthenius , klypin , & primack 1997 ; baker , davis , & lin 2000 ) .",
    "it may also be that the measurements as well as the models become somewhat unreliable on such small scales .",
    "the finite sizes of galaxies may also reduce the pvd somewhat .",
    "as shown in @xcite this can amount to up to 10 percent , if @xmath120 is taken as a fiducial size , but the effect can be more pronounced for large and interacting spiral galaxies .    nonetheless our results present a new constraint on the well - defined pvd statistic that any successful galaxy formation theory should explain . at the moment",
    ", we may speculate that perhaps the spiral galaxies obey a very special velocity bias , or that the cdm models are way off in the description of small scale clustering as recently discussed in a different context @xcite .",
    "to separate clearly the effect of introducing the clw bias and of constructing the mock catalogs , we present in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] the pvd from our full simulation for the cdm model and for the gif simulation .",
    "the cdm models adopting the clw bias with @xmath121 and @xmath76 have a significantly lower pvd than the dark matter .",
    "we can also see that the shape of the pvd is quite similar among the dark matter , the clw , and the gif samples , while the amplitude of the dark matter particle pvd is typically higher by a few @xmath122 . again",
    "the gif galaxies with @xmath93 or @xmath90 do not show any significant difference .",
    "the maximum in the pvd near @xmath101 present in the full simulation and the gif sample is much reduced by the construction of the mock catalogs , and also for the @xmath76 clw models .",
    "so far we have used the @xmath41 simulations alone in the comparison .",
    "since the boxsize is roughly the same with the pscz survey itself once the outer boundary of the survey is concerned ( in fact the weight of the most distant galaxies is small for our statistics and therefore the effective volume of the survey is much smaller than as the outer boundary indicates ) , our results may not faithfully reproduce the real cosmic variance even though we have three independent realizations . on the other hand ,",
    "the small - scale peculiar velocity dispersions are supposed to be sensitive to the numerical resolution , and the @xmath41 boxsize may be too large in this sense . to show that our @xmath41 simulations are not statistically biased",
    ", we compute the projected 2pcf and the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersions for mock samples from @xmath123 and @xmath124 lcdm simulations also ( again three realizations for each ) .",
    "the upper two panels of figure [ fig10 ] show the mean values of these two statistics .",
    "the agreement among the mock samples from different simulation boxes is satisfactory ; the small difference between different simulations can be easily accounted for by the simulation parameters like the large softening length in the @xmath124 .",
    "more important is the question if the error measurements from the @xmath41 simulations are underestimated .",
    "we show the ratio of the @xmath125 error from the @xmath124 ( @xmath123 ) simulations to that from the @xmath41 simulations in the lower panels .",
    "the error ratios for both statistics and for both boxsizes are very close to 1 for the scales @xmath126 .",
    "this comparison clearly illustrates that the expected values and their sample - to - sample variations for @xmath68 and @xmath100 are well represented in the three realizations in the @xmath41 simulations and in the gif mock samples .",
    "we have analyzed the data set of the iras pscz galaxies @xcite , and computed the two - point correlation functions and the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion for these galaxies .",
    "a power - law fit to the real - space 2pcf @xmath127 gives an exponent @xmath1 , and a lower amplitude @xmath2 than the value obtained for the las campanas redshift survey ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "we show that these results can be very well reproduced from mock samples constructed for a high resolution cdm simulation with @xmath8 and @xmath129 if we apply a biasing model which strongly underweights galaxies in the dense cluster regions .",
    "while this clw bias was originally introduced by jmb98 to fit the lcrs galaxies , the bias needed for the pscz galaxies is much stronger .",
    "more specifically , we find that the number of galaxies per unit dark matter in massive halos of mass @xmath22 should be proportional to @xmath23 with @xmath130 for the pcsz , as compared to @xmath131 for the lcrs .",
    "the change of @xmath78 from the lcrs to the pscz is not unexpected , since iras galaxies tend to avoid high - density cluster regions .",
    "the biased mock catalogs fit the 2pcf of the pscz galaxies extremely accurately .",
    "we also have selected samples from the gif simulation and shown that appropriate data sets can be drawn from that numerical catalog which give similar 2pcf .",
    "the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion measured from the pscz has a much lower value , about @xmath104 at @xmath105 , than the lcrs result at that separation of @xmath132 .",
    "all the simulation models which are consistent with the 2pcf of the pscz predict significantly larger values for pvd , although the clw bias reduces the pvd to within the @xmath133 limit of this value , at least near @xmath116 ( if @xmath134 ) . as discussed in the last section ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath3 for @xmath135 for the pscz data is significant , and can not be reproduced by the models . to test the robustness of this important result",
    ", we applied another phenomenological biasing prescription to our simulations which mimics the observed density - morphology relation of galaxies in clusters .",
    "more specifically , we have selected particles within halos with the probability equal to the fraction of spiral galaxies in rich clusters ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "the fraction is set to be independent of the halo mass for simplicity .",
    "this biasing model does reduce both the 2pcf and pvd slightly , but the effect is much smaller than the difference between the clw models and the pcsz result .",
    "this strengthens our conclusion that the steep decline of pvd on small scales can not be explained with the existing cdm model .    in conclusion , we find that the infrared selected galaxies in the pscz have a lower and less steep two - point correlation function than the optically selected sample of the lcrs .",
    "the pvd of the pscz galaxies is also lower , and has a different @xmath56 dependence than the corresponding quantity measured from the lcrs .",
    "spatially - flat cdm models with @xmath136 can give a good fit to the data , except for the small - scale behavior of the pvd , if a strong cluster antibias is imposed .",
    "the infrared selected galaxies require a much stronger clw bias than the optically selected ones .",

    "<S> we report on the measurement of the two - point correlation function and the pairwise peculiar velocity of galaxies in the iras pscz survey . </S>",
    "<S> we compute these statistics first in redshift space , and then obtain the projected functions which have simple relations to the real - space correlation functions on the basis of the method developed earlier in analyzing the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) by jing , mo , & brner ( 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the real space two - point correlation function can be fitted to a power law @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion @xmath3 is close to @xmath4 at @xmath5 and decreases to about @xmath6 at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are significantly lower than those obtained from the lcrs .    in order to understand the implications of those measurements on the galaxy biasing </S>",
    "<S> , we construct mock samples for a low density spatially - flat cold dark matter model ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) using a set of high - resolution n - body simulations in a boxsize of @xmath12mpc , @xmath13mpc , and @xmath14mpc . applying a stronger cluster - underweight biasing ( @xmath15 ) than for the lcrs ( @xmath16 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to reproduce these observational data , except for the strong decrease of the pairwise peculiar velocity at small separations . </S>",
    "<S> this is qualitatively ascribed to the different morphological mixture of galaxies in the two catalogues . </S>",
    "<S> disk - dominated galaxy samples drawn from the theoretically constructed gif catalog yield results rather similar to our mock samples with the simple cluster - underweight biasing . </S>",
    "<S> we further apply the phenomenological biasing model in our n - body mock samples which takes account of the density - morphology relation of galaxies in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the model does not reduce the velocity dispersions of galaxies to the level measured in the pscz data either . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that the peculiar velocity dispersions of the pscz galaxies require a biasing model which substantially reduces the peculiar velocity dispersion on small scales relative to their spatial clustering . </S>"
