    "the phenomenon of entropic transport is ubiquitous in biological cells , ion channels , nano - porous materials , zeolites and microfluidic devices etched with grooves and chambers . instead of diffusing freely in the host liquid phase",
    "the brownian particles frequently undergo a constrained motion @xcite .",
    "the geometric restrictions to the system s dynamics results in entropic barriers and regulate the transport of particles yielding important effects exhibiting peculiar properties .",
    "the results have prominent implications in processes such as catalysis , osmosis and particle separation @xcite and , as well , for the noise - induced transport in periodic potential landscapes that lack reflection symmetry ( brownian ratchet systems ) @xcite or brownian motor transport occurring in arrays of periodically arranged asymmetric obstacles , termed `` entropic '' ratchet devices @xcite .",
    "motion in these systems can be induced by imposing different concentrations at the ends of the channel , or by the presence of external driving forces supplying the particles with the energy necessary to proceed .",
    "the study of the kinetics of the entropic transport , the properties of transport coefficients in far from equilibrium situations and the possibility for transport control mechanisms are pertinent objectives in the dynamical characterization of those systems .",
    "because the role of inertia for the motion of the particles through these structures can typically be neglected the brownian dynamics can safely be analyzed by solving the smoluchowski equation in the domain defined by the available free space upon imposing the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "whereas this method has been very successful when the boundaries of the system possess a rectangular shape , the challenge to solve the boundary value problem in the case of nontrivial , corrugated domains represents a difficult task . a way to circumvent this difficulty consists in coarsening the description by reducing the dimensionality of the system , keeping only the main direction of transport , but taking into account the physically available space by means of an entropic potential .",
    "the resulting kinetic equation for the probability distribution , the so called fick - jacobs ( fj ) equation , is similar in form to the smoluchowski equation , but now contains an entropic term .",
    "the entropic nature of this term leads to a genuine dynamics which is distinctly different from that observed when the potential is of energetic origin @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the fj equation can provide a very accurate description of entropic transport in channels of varying cross - section @xcite .",
    "however , the derivation of the fj equation entails a tacit approximation : the particle distribution in the transverse direction is assumed to equilibrate much faster than in the main ( unconstrained ) direction of transport .",
    "this equilibration justifies the coarsening of the description leading in turn to a simplification of the dynamics , but raises the question about its validity when an _ external force is applied_. to establish the validity criterion of a fj description for such biased diffusion in confined media is , due to the ubiquity of this situation , a subject of primary importance .",
    "our objective with this work is to investigate in greater detail the fj - approximation for biased diffusion and to set up a corresponding criterion describing its regime of validity .",
    "we will analyze the biased movement of brownian particles in 2d periodic channels of varying cross section and formulate different criteria for the validity of such a fj - description . on the basis of our numerical and analytical results we recapitulate the striking and sometimes counterintuitive features @xcite , which arises from entropic transport and which are different from those observed in the more familiar case with energetic , metastable landscapes @xcite .",
    "transport through pores or channels ( like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) may be caused by different particle concentrations maintained at the ends of the channel , or by the application of external forces acting on the particles .",
    "here we will exclusively consider the case of force driven transport .",
    "the external driving force is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "it points into the direction of the channel axis . in general , the dynamics of a suspended brownian particle is overdamped @xcite and well described by the langevin equation ,     is a periodic function of @xmath1 with periodicity @xmath2 . ]",
    "@xmath3    where @xmath4 is time , @xmath5 the position vector of the particle , @xmath6 its friction coefficient , @xmath7 the boltzmann constant and @xmath8 the temperature . the thermal fluctuating forces which the surrounding fluid exerts on the particle are modeled by zero - mean gaussian white noise @xmath9 , obeying the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to eq .  , the full problem is set up by imposing reflecting boundary conditions at the channel walls .",
    "the form of the channel will be specified below .    to further simplify the treatment of this model we introduce dimensionless variables .",
    "we measure all lengths in units of the period @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimensionless position vector of the particle . as unit of time",
    "@xmath14 we choose twice the time it takes for the particle to diffusively cover the distance @xmath2 which is given by @xmath15 , hence , @xmath16 in these dimensionless variables the langevin equation reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and where the dimensionless force @xmath21 contains the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 that characterizes the force as the ratio of the work which it performs on the particle along a distance of the length of the period and the thermal energy .",
    "the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the time evolution of the probability distribution @xmath23 takes the form @xcite :    [ eq : fp ] @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the probability current : @xmath26    note that for channels with similar geometry , which are related by a scale transformation @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the transport properties are determined by the single dimensionless parameter @xmath22 which subsumes the period lengths , the force and the temperature of the surrounding fluid .",
    "the reflection of particles at the channel walls leads to a vanishing probability current at the boundaries .",
    "therefore , the boundary conditions at the channel walls are : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the normal vector field at the channel walls .",
    "the boundary of a 2d periodic channel which is mirror symmetric about its axis is given by the periodic functions @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 for all @xmath1 , where @xmath1 and @xmath33 are the cartesian components of @xmath13 .",
    "in this case , the boundary condition becomes @xmath34    + \\frac{\\partial p(x , y , t)}{\\partial y } = 0\\ , , \\ ] ] at @xmath35 .",
    "except for a straight channel with @xmath36 , there are no periodic channel shapes for which an exact analytical solution of the fokker - planck equation with boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) is known .",
    "approximate solutions though can be obtained on the basis of an one dimensional diffusion problem in an effective potential .",
    "narrow channel openings , which act as geometric hindrances in the full model , show up as entropic barriers in this one dimensional approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach is valid under conditions that will be discussed below in some detail .",
    "in the absence of an external force , i.e. for @xmath37 , it was shown @xcite that the dynamics of particles in confined structures ( such as that of fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) can be described approximatively by the fj equation , with a spatially dependent diffusion coefficient : @xmath38 this 1d equation is obtained from the full 2d smoluchowski equation upon the elimination of the transversal @xmath33 coordinate assuming fast equilibration in the transversal channel direction . here",
    "@xmath39 denotes the marginal probability density along the axis of the channel .",
    "we note that for three dimensional channels an analogue approximate fokker - planck equation holds in which the function @xmath40 is to be replaced by @xmath41 ( area of cross - section ) . in the original work by jacobs",
    "@xcite the 1d diffusion coefficient @xmath42 is constant and equals the bare diffusion constant which is unity in the present dimensionless variables .",
    "later , zwanzig @xcite and reguera and rub @xcite proposed different spatially dependent forms of the 1d diffusion coefficient .      the 1d diffusion coefficient suggested by zwanzig results from a systematic expansion in terms of the gradient of the boundary function @xmath40 . in leading order he obtained @xmath43 , where @xmath44 for the considered 2d structure ( for a 3d structure , @xmath45 ) and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath1 . interpreting this result as the first two terms of a geometric series zwanzig proposed his resumed expression for the 1d diffusion coefficient reading @xmath46 reguera and rub @xcite put forward a different form of the 1d diffusion coefficient : @xmath47 which also can be considered as a re - summation of zwanzig s perturbational result . yet another form of the 1d diffusion coefficient was proposed by kalinay and percus @xcite . for",
    "the biased diffusion discussed here the results obtained with the kalinay - percus diffusion coefficient differ only little from those obtained by the reguera - rub diffusion coefficient .",
    "therefore we do not further consider the kalinay - percus diffusion coefficient .      in the presence of a constant force @xmath48 along the direction of the channel the fj equation   can be recast into the form @xcite :    @xmath49    with the dimensionless free energy @xmath50 . in physical dimensions",
    "the energy is @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and the dimensional entropic contribution is @xmath53 . for a periodic channel",
    "this free energy assumes the form of a tilted periodic potential . in the absence of a force",
    "the free energy is purely entropic and eq .",
    "( [ eq : fickjacobs_ours ] ) reduces to the fj equation ( [ eq : fickjacobs ] ) . on the other hand , for a straight channel the entropic contribution vanishes and",
    "the particle is solely driven by the external force .",
    "key quantities of particle transport through periodic channels are the average _ particle current _ , or equivalently the nonlinear _ mobility _ , and the _ effective diffusion coefficient_. for a particle moving in a one dimensional tilted periodic potential the heights @xmath54 of the barriers separating the potential wells provide an additional energy scale apart from the work of the force @xmath55 and the thermal energy @xmath56 . hence , at least two dimensionless parameters , say @xmath57 and @xmath58 govern the transport properties of these systems . in contrast , as already noted in the context of the full 2d model the transport through channels is governed by the single dimensionless parameter @xmath59 .",
    "this , of course , remains to hold true in the one dimensional approximation which models the transversal spatial variation in terms of an entropic potential .    for any non negative force",
    "the average particle current in periodic structures can be obtained from @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the first time of a particle which starts at @xmath62 to arrive at @xmath63 .",
    "the angular brackets refer to an average over the fluctuating force .",
    "note that the resulting mean first passage time @xmath64 diverges for a vanishing force and consequently leads to a vanishing current .",

    "this choice of parameters corresponds to rather short channels for @xmath85 and a more elongated one for @xmath86 . in all cases",
    "the width of the widest opening of the channel is larger by a factor of @xmath87 than the width at narrowest opening .",
    "one may therefore expect strong entropic effects for these channels .",

    "[ fig : comparison ] demonstrates that the resumed one dimensional diffusion coefficient @xmath94 leads to a considerably better agreement with the numerical results than the constant diffusion and the diffusion coefficient @xmath95 proposed by zwanzig .",
    "therefore we used @xmath92 for all following calculations .",
    "the reduction of dimensionality leading to the fj equation relies on the assumption of equilibration in the transverse direction which results in an almost uniform distribution of the transversal positions @xmath33 at fixed values of the longitudinal coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "one can formulate two different sets of criteria determining first , whether the fj equation describes the relaxation towards the stationary state , say in presence of periodic boundary conditions , or second , whether the stationary state , but not necessarily the relaxation towards this state , can be described by the fj equation .",
    "although we here are mainly interested in the second , weaker , type of criteria which are sufficient to guarantee the validity of the transport properties predicted by the fj equation , we shortly formulate stronger criteria which must be satisfied if the fj equation is employed to determine the relaxation towards equilibrium .",
    "then , of course , the time scale of equilibration in transversal direction @xmath96 must be short compared to the relevant time scales in longitudinal direction , @xmath97 @xcite . the time scale @xmath98 can be estimated by the time to diffusively cover the widest transversal distance of the channel .",
    "it therefore is given by @xmath99 the time scales characterizing the longitudinal motion are the diffusion time @xmath100 over the length of a period , which is one in our dimensionless variables , and the time @xmath101 it takes to drag a particle over this distance by applying the force @xmath22 .",
    "these times are given by @xmath102 hence , a necessary condition , that the fj equation reliably describes transient processes can be formulated as @xmath103 this condition is fulfilled only for rather elongated channels being at least five times as long as wide .    as already mentioned in the presence of periodic boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction ,",
    "the particle distribution described by the fokker - planck equation approaches a stationary distribution .",
    "even in the case if the first criterion ( [ c1 ] ) is violated the stationary solution of the fj equation ( [ eq : fickjacobs_ours ] ) may still yield the correct marginal probability density provided transversal cuts of the two dimensional stationary probability density are practically constant .",
    "such a uniform distribution in transversal direction strictly holds in the absence of externally imposed concentration differences if the force @xmath22 vanishes or if the channel is straight . for channels with varying width",
    "the narrow positions confine the positions of particles .",
    "from there they are dragged by the force and at the same time they perform a diffusive motion until the channel narrows again .",
    "the required uniform distribution in the transversal direction can only be achieved if the diffusional motion is fast enough in comparison to the deterministic drift under the influence of @xmath22 .",
    "in other words , the diffusional spreading within the time the force drags the particle from the narrowest to the widest place in the channel must be at least of the order of the widest channel width .",

    "transport in one dimensional periodic _ energetic _",
    "potentials behaves very differently from one dimensional periodic systems with _ entropic",
    "_ barriers .",
    "the fundamental difference lies in the temperature dependence of these models . decreasing temperature in an energetic periodic potential decreases the transition rates from one period to the neighboring by decreasing the arrhenius factor @xmath115 where @xmath54 denotes the activation energy necessary to proceed by a period @xcite . hence decreasing temperature leads to a decreasing mobility . for a one - dimensional periodic system with an entropic potential ,",
    "a decrease of temperature leads to an increase of the dimensionless force parameter @xmath22 and consequently to an increase of the mobility , cf .",
    "[ fig : mobility ] .",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of the dynamics on the geometry parameter @xmath81 clearly reflects the entropic effects on the mobility .",
    "a channel with a larger @xmath81 value has wider openings and therefore provides more space where the particle can sojourn .",
    "this longer residence time within a period of the channel diminishes the throughput and consequently the mobility .",
    "this is corroborated by the results of our calculations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobility ] . for all values of @xmath22 ,",
    "an increase in value of @xmath81 leads to a decrease in the mobility .",

    "another interesting effect can be observed for the effective diffusion if looked as a function of the force @xmath22 .",
    "already the expression for the effective diffusion which follows rigorously from the fj equation displays a maximum as a function of @xmath22 which may even exceed the value 1 of the bare diffusion , cf .",
    "[ fig : diffusion ] .",
    "for @xmath118 the periodic stationary distribution approaches a delta function along the @xmath1 axis and the effective diffusion approaches the bare value 1 .",
    "if one decreases the force to finite but still large values then the stationary distribution acquires a finite width in the transversal direction with a `` crowded '' region in front of the narrowest place of the channel ref .",
    "the transport becomes more noisy and consequently the effective diffusion exceeds the bare value 1 . on the other hand",
    "if one starts at @xmath119 the entropic barriers diminish the diffusion such that the effective diffusion is less than bare diffusion .",
    "consequently , somewhere in between there must be a value of @xmath22 with maximal effective diffusion . for @xmath85 and @xmath120",
    "the value of the force at the maximal effective diffusion is outside the regime of validity of the fj equation .",
    "the numerical simulations give a much more pronounced peak of the effective diffusion .",
    "for the less entropic channel with @xmath121 the maximum is at the border of the regime of validity of the fj equation , but the enhancement of the effective diffusion constant is less pronounced than for the larger value @xmath85 . these observations lead us to the conclusion that entropic effects increase the randomness of transport through a channel and in this way decrease the mobility and increase the effective diffusion .",
    "a similar enhancement of effective diffusion was found in titled periodic _ energetic _",
    "potentials @xcite .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated that transport phenomena in periodic channels with varying width exhibit some features that are radically different from conventional transport occurring in energetic periodic potential landscapes .",
    "the most striking difference between these two physical situations lies in the fact that for a fixed channel geometry the dynamics is completely characterized by a single parameter @xmath122 which combines the external force @xmath48 causing a drift , the period length @xmath2 of the channel , and the thermal energy @xmath56 , which is a measure of the strength of the acting fluctuating forces .",
    "transport in periodic energetic potentials depends , at least , on one further parameter which is the height of the highest barrier separating neighboring periods .",
    "this leads to an opposite temperature dependence of the mobility . while the mobility of a particle in an energetic potential increases with increasing temperature the mobility of a particle in a channel of periodically varying width decreases",
    "the incorporation of the spatial variation of the channel width as an entropic potential in the fj equation allows a qualitative understanding of the dependence of the transport properties on the channel geometry .",
    "the effective diffusion exhibits a non monotonic dependence versus the dimensionless force @xmath22 .",
    "it starts out at small @xmath22 with a value that is less than the bare diffusion constant , reaches a maximum with increasing @xmath22 and finally approaches the value of the bare diffusion from above .",
    "it is known from the literature that , under certain conditions , the two - dimensional fokker - planck equation governing the time dependence of the probability density of a particle in the channel can be approximated by a one - dimensional fokker - planck equation : it is termed the fick - jacobs equation and contains an entropic potential and a position dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "various forms of the diffusion coefficient can be found in the literature .",
    "a comparison of different forms for a particular channel geometry leads to the conclusion that the expression recently suggested by reguera and rub yields the most favorable agreement . in principle",
    "the fj equation describes both the transient behavior of a particle and also the stationary behavior of the particle dynamics which is approached in the limit of large times , provided appropriate boundary conditions confining the motion in the direction of the channel axis are applied . in order to study stationary transport ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions must be invoked .",
    "we formulated criteria for the validity of the fj equation for both the transient and the stationary regimes and found that the restrictions imposed by the criterion in the stationary regime are much less serious than those for the transient dynamics .",
    "the estimates , which are based on simple dynamical arguments , were corroborated by our numerical simulations .",
    "we restricted our analysis to two dimensional channels .",
    "a generalization of the presented methods to three dimensional pores with varying cross section is in principle straight - forward .",
    "we also confined ourselves to channels with a mirror symmetry about a vertical axis which in the present case can be chosen at @xmath123 . for periodic channel shapes without this",
    "symmetry ratchet like transport can be expected even if the unbiased force @xmath22 of vanishing temporal average changes periodically in time .",

    "<S> the dynamics of brownian motion has widespread applications extending from transport in designed micro - channels up to its prominent role for inducing transport in molecular motors and brownian motors . here , brownian transport </S>",
    "<S> is studied in micro - sized , two dimensional periodic channels , exhibiting periodically varying cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the particles in addition are subjected to an external force acting alongside the direction of the longitudinal channel axis . for a fixed channel geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the two dimensional problem is characterized by a single dimensionless parameter which is proportional to the ratio of the applied force and the temperature of the particle environment . in such structures </S>",
    "<S> entropic effects may play a dominant role . under certain conditions </S>",
    "<S> the two dimensional dynamics can be approximated by an effective one dimensional motion of the particle in the longitudinal direction . </S>",
    "<S> the langevin equation describing this reduced , one dimensional process is of the type of the fick - jacobs equation . </S>",
    "<S> it contains an entropic potential determined by the varying extension of the eliminated channel direction , and a correction to the diffusion constant that introduces a space dependent diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> different forms of this correction term have been suggested before , which we here compare for a particular class of models . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the regime of validity of the fick - jacobs equation , both by means of analytical estimates and the comparisons with numerical results for the full two dimensional stochastic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for the nonlinear mobility we find a temperature dependence which is opposite to that known for particle transport in periodic potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of entropic effects is discussed for both , the nonlinear mobility and the effective diffusion constant .    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    </S>",
