    "it was first noted by s chandrasekhar in 1931 that the mass of the compact star at very large densities , when electrons become relativistically degenerate can not exceed a value , which is now called as chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs ( chandrasekhar , 1931 ) .",
    "after discovery of the neutron in 1932 the idea of the neutron star existence was developed .",
    "the matter in these stars is so dense , that neutrons become relativistically degenerate , again leading to the maximum mass of the neutron star .",
    "there are two important differences between white dwarfs and neutron stars , influencing the stability and mass limit .",
    "neutron stars are about 6 orders of magnitude denser , than white dwarfs , making necessary to use general relativity ( gr ) in description of gravitation , instead of newtonian gravity . in gr",
    "the gravitation force is growing faster than @xmath0 , what reduce a stability and decrease the mass limit . on the other hand neutrons interaction",
    "become important at densities exceeding the nuclear one .",
    "the repulsion forces between nucleons at large densities lead to additional stabilization against collapse , increasing the limiting mass of the neutron star .",
    "the influence of the second factor occurs to be more important , so at present the limiting mass of the neutron star is taken about two times larger than that of the white dwarf .",
    "discovery of the quark structure of the matter led to suggestion of possible existence of quark stars , even more compact than neutron ones . in presence of indefiniteness concerning quark structure of the matter",
    "it is not possible now to make definite statements about possibility of existence or nonexistence of stable quark stars , observational and theoretical investigations on this topic are still in progress .    in this review",
    "i first make a historical excursus into the problem , mentioning the results of the key works .",
    "several criteria of stability are discussed , with the main attention to the static criteria , and energetic method , which permit to obtain the conclusion about the stability ( sometimes approximately ) in a most simple way .",
    "critical states of compact stars at the boundary of the dynamic stability are considered , at which the star is becoming instable in the process of energy losses , and collapse begins leading to formation of the neutron star or a black hole . physical processes leading to a loss of stability are discussed . at the end some observations and theoretical problems connected with quark stars are considered .",
    "from the theory of polytropic gravitating gas spheres with the equation of state @xmath1 it was known ( emden , 1907 ) , that at @xmath2 the equilibrium mass has a unique value    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is a non - dimensional mass , corresponding to the polytropic index @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "such a star is in a neutral equilibrium at any density .",
    "chandrasekhar ( 1931 ) first noticed , that at large densities the electron degeneracy is becoming ultrarelativistic with the equation of state    @xmath7    for some unknown reason chandrasekhar ( 1931 ) took `` @xmath8 equals the molecular weight , 2.5 , for a fully ionized material '' , corresponding to @xmath9 and had obtained the limiting mass from ( [ eq1 ] ) equal to @xmath10g@xmath11 .",
    "landau ( 1932 ) noticed , that for most stable nuclei : he@xmath12 , c@xmath13 , o@xmath14 etc .",
    "the value of @xmath8 , which is the number of nucleons on one electron , is equal to 2 , and he obtained the realistic value of the limiting mass @xmath15 .    soon after the neutron discovery ( chadwick , 24 feb .",
    "1932 , letter to n.bohr ) , `` landau improvised the concept of neutron star '' in discussion with bohr ( rosenfeld , 1974 ) .",
    "the modern conception of the neutron star origin was due to baade and zwicky ( 1934 ) , which appeared as a result of their studies of supernovae explosions .",
    "their conclusion : `` with all reserve we advance the view that supernovae represent the transitions from ordinary stars into _ neutron stars _ , which in their final stages consist of extremely closely packed neutrons '' , is an example of classic astrophysical predictions , finally proved only 35 years later after discovery of the pulsar in the center of the crab nebula ( lovelace et al .",

    "investigation of properties of matter at nuclear and larger densities expected in neutron stars had been started in papers of hund ( 1936 ) , landau ( 1938 ) and gamow ( 1938 ) .",
    "the first neutron star model in gr was constructed by oppenheimer and volkoff ( 1939 ) .",
    "they have derived equation of spherically symmetric stellar equilibrium in gr using metric in the form    @xmath16    with equilibrium equations    @xmath17    @xmath18 an ideal degenerate neutron gas at zero temperature was considered with energy @xmath19 , pressure @xmath20 , and rest mass density @xmath21 as    @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where    @xmath25    @xmath26 they had obtained the following parameters of the neutron stars of different masses :     & radius in km & 0.30&21.1height 12pt width0pt&0.60&13.3&0.71&9.5&0.64&6.8&0.34&3.1 &    between white dwarfs and neutron star there is a neutronization and transition from normal matter with electrons and nuclei to superdense matter consisting of neutrons and other strongly interacting particles : mesons and adrons .",
    "the continuous curve @xmath27 in the whole region from white dwarfs to neutron stars was first constructed by wheeler ( 1958 ) , where only neutrons have been considered in the superdense phase , like in oppenheimer and volkoff ( 1939 ) .",
    "the results of wheeler ( 1958 ) are given in fig.1 .",
    "the first neutron star model with a realistic equation of state , including mesons , hyperons and nuclear interaction , was constructed by cameron ( 1959 ) .",
    "the following equilibrium reactions between strongly interacting particles had been taken into account    @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 the nuclear interaction was considered according to skryme ( 1959 ) , see fig.2 .",
    "this equation of state is not perfect , because at large densities it violates the casuality principle , according to which the sound speed can not exceed the light speed ( see zeldovich , 1961 ) .",
    "neutron star models obtained by cameron ( 1959 ) are represented in fig.3 .",
    "the most important result of this work was the indication that at realistic equation of state the limiting mass of the neutron star may exceed the chandrasekhar mass limit for white dwarfs .",
    "therefore after a loss of stability a stellar core with mass exceeding the chandrasekhar mass limit may stop its contraction forming a stable neutron star with enormous energy output , according to baade and zwicky ( 1934 ) . in the model of oppenheimer and volkoff ( 1939 ) the collapse would not stop , because of the low mass limit of the neutron star .",
    "cameron ( 1959 ) had obtained that models at high densities had monotonously decreasing mass asymptotically tending to a constant value .",
    "that was probably the result of a crudeness of calculations , because the behavior of the curve @xmath27 at large densities has oscillating , and not monotonous dependence .",
    "such oscillations had been present in calculations of ambartsumyan and saakyan ( 1961 ) , who also improved physical description of superdense matter ( ambartsumyan and saakyan , 1960 ) .",
    "the nature of high density oscillations of mass in gr equilibrium was explained by dmitriyev and kholin ( 1963 ) ( see also misner and zapolsky , 1964 ) .",
    "they had shown that all models beyond the first neutron star mass maximum on the curve @xmath27 are unstable , and after each new extremum the model acquires one new unstable mode .",
    "later this problem was analyzed at length in the book of harrison et al .",
    "detailed calculations of neutron star models with a realistic equation of state had been done by saakyan and vartanyan ( 1964 ) .    .",
    "the exact approach to the problem of dynamic ( linear ) stability is based on the solution of the equations for small perturbations , and finding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of these equations . in the conservative system",
    "the variation principle may be derived , which determines the exact value of eigenfrequency if the exact eigenfunction is known . in practice",
    "even use of an approximate linear eigenfunction often define the eigenfrequency with a good precision .",
    "the variation principle for a spherically symmetric star in gr was first derived by chandrasekhar ( 1964 ) from the equations of small perturbations , and later by harrison et al .",
    "( 1965 ) by variation of the potential energy of the star .",
    "the exact method for determination of the dynamic stability of the star to the adiabatic perturbations based on the sequence of static solutions was formulated by zeldovich ( 1963 ) .",
    "he had shown , that in the extremum of the function @xmath27 , or @xmath34 along the sequence with a constant entropy @xmath35 adds or subtract one unstable mode . on the curve of cold stars on fig.1 the stability is lost in the first maximum due to neutronization , or gr effects , but it is restored in the minimum , where stable neutron star appears .",
    "the static criterium of stability was generalized for the case of arbitrary rotating stars with arbitrary distribution of entropy over the star in the paper of bisnovatyi - kogan and blinnikov ( 1974 ) .",
    "it was noted , that in presence of three quantities conserved during adiabatic oscillations , the critical points are the extrema of three functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . here along the sequences not only total values of stellar angular momentum @xmath39 and entropy @xmath35 should be conserved , but also their distributions over the lagrangian coordinate @xmath40 , which is the number of baryons inside the cylindrical radius , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "are represented in fig . 4 from bisnovatyi - kogan and blinnikov ( 1974 ) .",
    "let us stress , that along the curve appropriate for a static criterium of stability the rotation does not remain rigid , but only angular momentum of each lagrangian loop should be conserved .",
    "it means that if you have a curve of rigidly rotating stars with a fixed total angular momentum you should construct an adjusted curve from each point of this curve with a constant angular momentum of a lagrangian loop , which maximum indicated a loss of stability .",

    "the adiabatic index is close to @xmath5 at the critical point , and the eigenfunction is close the the linear one . at homologous transformation",
    "the rigid rotation is preserved , so the adjusted curve for white dwarfs differs only slightly from the curve of rigidly rotating models , see fig.5 ( left ) . for a more complicated equation of state with highly variable adiabatic index , like in the equation of state    @xmath49,\\ ] ]    @xmath50.\\ ] ]",

    "the loss of stability occurs at the point of intersection of the associated curve @xmath54 with the solid - body one , this point coinciding with the maximum on the curve @xmath54 .",
    "it can be seen from fig.5 ( right ) that the point of stability loss differs from the maximum on the solid - body curve by almost 5% with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "an extension of static criteria to general relativity and toroidal magnetic fields is made in the paper of bisnovatyi - kogan and blinnikov ( 1974 ) .",
    "static criteria remains valid also in the presence of phase transitions .",
    "variational principle and other methods of investigation of stability in presence of phase transitions are considered by bisnovatyi - kogan , blinnikov and shnol ( 1975 ) .",
    "the review of stellar stability methods is given in the book of bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2002 ) .",
    "in the case of a complicated equation of state and entropy distribution along the star , the static criteria is hard to apply . in this case",
    "it is more convenient to use an approximate energetic method , which follows from the exact variation principle where linear trial function is used for estimation of the eigenfrequency .",
    "energetic method was first applied for investigation of stability of supermassive isentropic stars by zeldovich and novikov ( 1965 ) where first gr corrections to the energy of such star have been found .",
    "this method was generalized for arbitrary stars by bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1966 ) .",
    "equations have been derived , giving approximate description of equilibrium and determining the critical point where stability is lost .",
    "the first equation represents equilibrium condition , following from first variation of the total potential energy of that star ( gravitational plus internal for nonrotating stars ) equal to zero . the model with adiabatic index @xmath5",
    ", @xmath2 is in a neutral stability with a linear eigenfunction . in application of the energetic method the density distribution of the model",
    "is prescribed by the polytropic @xmath5 distribution , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is lagrangian mass coordinate , and @xmath58 is connected with the emden function corresponding to @xmath5 , with a linear trial function @xmath59 , @xmath60=const .",
    "the equation of state is arbitrary with the prescribed entropy distribution over the lagrangian coordinate , and first gr correction to the energy , including all terms @xmath61 , @xmath62 is stellar radius , @xmath63 is the gravitational radius , are taken into account .",
    "the equilibrium equation in the approximate energetic method is :    @xmath64    under the above mentioned conditions the second variation of the energy is also reduced to the integral relation .",
    "zero value of this relation approximately corresponds to the critical state of the loss of stability .",
    "we have    @xmath65    these equations had been obtained by bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1966 ) , using the expression of the energy with the prescribed distributions of the density ( emden polytrope @xmath5 ) and entropy ( arbitrary ) over the lagrangian coordinate @xmath66 ,    @xmath67    @xmath68 @xmath69 by differentiation over the central density .",
    "critical parameters of iron isentropic stellar cores for masses between 5 and 1000 @xmath70 at the point of the loss of stability had been calculated by bisnovatyi - kogan and kazhdan ( 1966 ) .",
    "the dependence of the critical central density on mass is represented in fig.6 ( bisnovatyi - kogan , 2002 ) for a wide region of masses . at low masses , high densities the stability in the iron core",
    "is lost due to neutronization . for larger masses the temperature in the critical point is increasing , and stability is lost due to iron disintegration , decreasing the adiabatic power , and making it @xmath71 . at masses around 1000 @xmath70 with decreasing density and temperature , the adiabatic power becomes less than 4/3 mainly due to pair creation , and at farther increasing of mass the effects of gr are the main reason of the loss of stability ( zeldovich and novikov , 1965 ) . at large masses",
    "the dependence @xmath72 is described by the relation    @xmath73    where @xmath8 is the molecular weight .",
    "models of hot isentropic neutron stars had been calculated by bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1968 ) , where equilibrium between iron , protons and neutrons was calculated , and the ratio of protons and neutrons was taken in the approximation of zero chemical potential of neutrino .",
    "the stability was checked using a variational principle in full gr ( chandrasekhar , 1964 ) with a linear trial function .",
    "the results of calculations , showing the stability region of hot `` neutron '' stars are given in fig.7 .",
    "such stars may be called `` neutron '' only by convention , because they consist mainly from nucleons with almost equal presence of neutrons and protons .",
    "the maximum of the mass is about 70@xmath70 , but from comparison of the total energies of hot neutron stars with presupernova cores we may conclude , that only collapsing cores with masses less that 15@xmath70 have a chance to stop at the state of a hot neutron star , and larger masses collapse directly to black holes .",
    "the energetic method was generalized for rotating stars in the paper of bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich and novikov ( 1967 ) , and in a more precise formulation by bisnovatyi - kogan and ruzmaikin ( 1973 ) .",
    "the density distribution remains the same , and the rotational energy term , written as a function of the total angular momentum was added .",
    "rotational energy of the whole star depends on the central density as @xmath74 , like the first gr correction term in ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "therefore next order gr corrections had been taken into account @xmath75 , which include also gr corrections to the internal and rotational energies .",
    "calculations of the second gr corrections to the energy of nonrotating stars have been first done by vartanyan ( 1972 ) .",
    "energetic method with two gr corrections for rotating stars was applied for investigation of stability of supermasive stars by bisnovatyi - kogan and ruzmaikin ( 1973 ) .",
    "it was obtained , that for large angular momenta rotation stabilizes the star against a collapse and prevent formation of a black hole .",
    "it is in correspondence with a fact , that kerr solution for a rotating black hole exist only for sufficiently small angular momenta , and there are no black holes at larger values . only radiation with @xmath2 was taken into account in the equation of state , what lead to absence of equilibrium configurations at low angular momenta @xmath76 .",
    "the curves for equilibrium configurations at different @xmath76 are represented in fig.8 on the plane : equilibrium entropy @xmath77 - @xmath78 .",
    "the results are expressed in non - dimensional variables and are valid for an arbitrary mass star with the adiabatic equation of state @xmath79 .",
    "the energetic method gives asymptotically exact results for slowly rotating supermassive stars , but even at large @xmath76 the results remain correct qualitatively .",
    "at very high densities the equilibrium lowest energy state corresponds to quarks .",
    "however because of big indefiniteness of the theory the condition at which the quark state becomes preferable lays in a big density interval .",
    "moreover , the process of transition between nucleon and quark state is also not definite , and even at very large densities the time of this transition may be enormously long .",
    "first the idea of a possibility of quark stars was suggested by ivanenko and kurdgelaidze ( 1965 ) .",
    "depending on the theory parameters there is a possibility of 3 types of quark stars : strange stars ( ss ) , which consists of strange matter which may be stable at nuclear density with a zero pressure ; hybrid stars with hadronic envelope , which has a core of pure quarks ( qc ) , or has a mixed core of hadrons and quarks ( mc ) .",

    "the free quarks exist in the state of deconfined quarks , and the density when deconfined quarks become energetically preferable is also rather indefinite ( berezhiani et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "larger scattering of the properties of quark stars is obtained by andersen and strickland ( 2002 ) , who used the same hard - dense - loop approach , but with wider variation of parameters .",
    "their models of quark stars are represented in fig.10 .    in presence of such problems with theory",
    ", only observations could give an answer about the possibility os existence of quark stars .",
    "even in presence of theoretical indefiniteness , it is impossible to have a neutron ( pure hadronic ) star with a radius smaller than about 10 kilometers .",
    "observational discovery of a compact star with considerably smaller radius would be an important evidence that this star is not pure hadronic .",
    "such claim was made by drake et al .",

    "they wrote : `` we argue that the derived interstellar medium neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath80 @xmath81 favours the larger distance from two recent hst parallax analyses , placing rx j1856.5 - 3754 at @xmath82  pc instead of @xmath83  pc . ... the combined observational evidence  a lack of spectral and temporal features , and an implied radius @xmath84 - 8.2  km that is too small for current neutron star models ",
    "points to a more compact object , such as allowed for quark matter equations of state . ''",
    "subsequent analysis of observational data did not confirm this conclusion .",
    "thoma et al .",
    "( 2003 ) came to contrary result of an unusually large value of the radius even for a neutron star : `` combining such a x - ray spectrum with the optical spectrum , one finds a black - body radius @xmath85 km , indicating a stiff equation of state , which would exclude a strange quark matter star or even hybrid star .",
    "this is a rather conservative lower limit for the radius since a black - body emitter is the most efficient radiator . ''",
    "similar conclusion was done by turolla et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : `` while a quark star may be a conceivable option , present observations do not necessarily demand this solution and more conventional scenarios involving a neutron star are certainly possible .",
    "neutron star models based on a two - temperature surface distribution can account for both the x - ray and optical emission , giving at the same time acceptable values for the stellar radius . ''",
    "meanwhile a new candidate for a quark ( strange ) star in the x - ray source 4u 1728 - 34 was suggested by bombaci ( 2003 ) , and farther discussion about this object is expected .",
    "so far no reliable candidate for a quark ( strange ) star was found by observations .",
    "the theoretical predictions remain uncertain , and could explain either existence or nonexistence of quark stars .",
    "the solution of intriguing problem of cosmological gamma ray burst ( grb ) origin was proposed by berezhiani et al ( 2003 ) basing on energy production during transformation of the neutron star into a stable quark ( strange ) star .",
    "this model could explain the connection of grb with supernovae explosions with a formation of a neutron star , and subsequent huge energy release during transition to a state of a quark star producing grb .",
    "an attractive feature of this model is a possibility of explanation of any time delay between sn and grb explosions , which depends on the transition time from hadron to quark state , and is very sensitive to parameters . in this model",
