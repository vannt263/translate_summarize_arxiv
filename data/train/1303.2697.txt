    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are interesting highly energetic phenomena for which there is still no definitive explanation on the originating mechanism ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . regarding the initial event that triggers a grb , the combination of the observed short variability timescales and huge radiated energies points towards cataclysmic events leading to the formation of a stellar compact object with mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 releasing a gravitational energy @xmath2 erg .",
    "specifically , according to their time duration , grbs can be classified as @xmath3 ( lgrbs ) if the duration of the gamma - ray signal is larger than 2 s and short ( sgrbs ) in other cases @xcite , although the boundary is not sharply delimited ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are several pieces of evidence in favour of an association of lgrbs with massive stars , especially the facts that they occur in star - forming regions @xcite and that supernovae have been found in association with a few of them ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to the _ collapsar _ model @xcite where a lgrb is associated with the gravitational collapse of a massive , wolf - rayet , star leading to the formation of an accreting stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) .",
    "an alternative scenario where the central engine formed after the gravitational collapse is a young , rapidly rotating ( ms period ) neutron star ( ns ) has also been considered by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the identification of the progenitors of sgrbs is more uncertain @xcite .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that the detection of sgrb afterglows is technically more difficult , and therefore rarer , than for lgrbs .",
    "so far there is only a handful of detected afterglows , since the first detection in 2005 @xcite .",
    "sgrbs can occur in all types of galaxies , either of a star - forming type or not @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the most popular scenario , that is the merger of a ns+ns or ns+bh binary system .    as a main motivation for the present contribution and due to the current uncertainties on the origin of ( especially short ) grbs ,",
    "it is worth investigating other possible classes of cataclysmic events where astrophysical stellar compact objects are involved .",
    "we will focus on nss .",
    "a ns can be partially characterized by a set of static observables , namely mass , @xmath4 , and radius , @xmath5 .",
    "the structure of a ns has been discussed thoroughly in the past ( for a review see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it can be briefly described by a dense _ core _ , where matter is in the form of a liquid of nucleons ( or additional particles including strangeness ) , and a _ crust _ where matter undergoes a liquid - solid transition into a clusterized myriad of nuclei @xcite . in more detail , the so - called neutron drip ( nd ) line signals the boundary between the outer and inner crust where neutrons start to leak out from nuclei .",
    "the mass in the crust is small ( up to a few percent ) as compared to the whole ns and therefore it could be accelerated , if ejected by large energies , to large velocities or even high lorentz factors .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) that governs the description of matter in the inside of nss is currently poorly known .",
    "whether matter remains in the form of baryons or deconfined quarks is a matter of debate .",
    "the problem of the internal constituents in a ns has been thoroughly and periodically revisited from the early 1930 s when landau predicted the existence of such objects @xcite from the basis of the existence of neutral hadronic particles . from the discovery of the neutron by chadwick in 1932 to 1984 when it was hypothesized @xcite that a more stable type of matter could be possible ( formed by roughly equal quantities of @xmath6 quarks , arising from weak decay of regular @xmath7 matter present in nucleonic matter made of protons and neutrons ) a wide variety of possible nuclear configurations has been proposed . in this latter quark system case ,",
    "for example , recent attention has been devoted to lattice calculations showing the possibility of the existence of the @xmath8dibaryon , with @xmath9 quark content @xcite and experimental input from the lhc is expected on the formation of a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "a stable type of extended strange matter would allow the existence of stars even more compact than nss , i.e. hybrid or pure quark stars ( qss ) @xcite .",
    "the transition from a nucleonic type of matter to a quark phase is presently not well understood . from the theoretical point of view , some work has been done @xcite on the possibility of quark bubble nucleation in a cold system , where the temperature is well approximated by @xmath10 . as this mechanism",
    "is not efficient enough , this process may seem unlikely to occur .",
    "another series of works have been developed by ouyed and collaborators which propose the quark - nova model in which a massive ns converts explosively to a quark star @xcite .",
    "the transition is obtained mostly via a central density increase due to spin - down or accretion forming a conversion front that propagates toward the surface .",
    "the outcome is ejection of the ns s outermost layers at relativistic speeds . alternatively ,",
    "as we explain in this work , additional _ external _ agents may be able to produce thermal excitations in these dense degenerate matter systems .    from indications concerning astrophysical and cosmological backgrounds",
    "we know that dark matter ( dm ) is distributed inhomogeneously in the universe and , additionally , could be gravitationally accreted onto individual massive astrophysical objects .",
    "one of the most popular dark matter candidates is considered to be a majorana - type weakly interacting particle ( wimp ) , although other asymmetric dark matter candidates could exist as well @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    ", current direct and indirect detection experiments try to constrain its properties .",
    "for example , direct detection earth - based experiments dama @xcite , cogent @xcite , cresst and lately coupp @xcite seem to point towards a light particle in the @xmath11 @xmath12 mass range ( although this is in tension with other null searches ) while there has been a lot of interest in indirect detection of new excesses of extra photon components from the galactic center that could be due to annihilation of a @xmath13 @xmath12 particle @xcite , albeit so far at only the @xmath14 level of significance .",
    "dm passing through astrophysical massive objects is expected to scatter off their constituent nuclei , lose energy , and become trapped by their gravitational field .",
    "multiple scatterings cause dm to sink towards the center and afterwards , assuming that it may self - annihilate , a series of end products are available .",
    "based on the previous arguments , a set of current experiments try to find evidence for this process in the sun , earth @xcite or even more compact - sized objects such as nss @xcite .",
    "recently , new ideas on the possibility that quark bubbles may be formed by spark seeding in the inner cores of dense nss have been proposed by @xcite .",
    "sparks would be generated in a sort of _ trojan horse _ mechanism by self - annihilation of dark matter particles gravitationally accreted by nss gathering in their internal cores . as estimated",
    ", this would allow release energies of up to about one order of magnitude higher than the quark binding energies in the present baryons @xcite .",
    "this mechanism then could lead to the conversion of nss into qss if the transition to quark matter phase is macroscopic . in this way the matter component in the form of dm would not only influence cosmological observables , but even ns dynamics @xcite .",
    "similar arguments have been claimed in the solar seismology observables @xcite .",
    "we investigate in the present paper whether this type of _ non - repeating _ cataclysmic event could produce sgrbs and what could be a possible specific signature .",
    "after a short summary of the scenario in  [ sect : scenario ] , in  [ sect : energetics ] we compare the energy released by sgrbs with the energetics of the progenitor model that we propose and in ",
    "[ sect : rate ] we discuss the short grb event rate in light of this scenario as compared to observed rates , as well as the natural delay time between the regular ns phase and qs formation and how this mechanism may affect the properties of the host galaxies of short grbs . in  [ sect : engine ] we present and analyze the ejecta and crust masses that could be expelled due to the ns@xmath15qs conversion and we present the details of the resulting central engine model . in  [ sect : grb ] we attempt to discuss the expected temporal (  [ sect : duration ] ) and spectral (  [ sect : spectrum ] ) properties of the prompt gamma - ray emission and the afterglow . in ",
    "[ sect : gw ] we discuss our results and possible genuine additional signals and gravitational wave emission that could finally lead to a clear identification as compared with the short grb scenario involving binary mergers . finally in ",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] we give a brief summary of our conclusions and suggestions on how to proceed in further work .",
    "there has been some previous work where dm accretion in astrophysical objects has been considered @xcite . as a summary , we start in this section by motivating the scenario where the emission of a sgrb may occur .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite the possibility of spark seeding in ns as a result of dm accretion was proposed .",
    "we found a relationship between the mass of the dm particle , @xmath16 , and the binding energy of the lump of quark matter or strangelet formed , @xmath17 as calculated from the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the baryonic number density and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the chemical potential and mass of the quark of @xmath22type in the light sector , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the bag constant .",
    "the channels available to the @xmath25 annihilation are , so far , not known and this uncertainty is phenomenologically parametrized into the fraction @xmath26 . inside the ns",
    ", it is believed that dm scatters one or more times and thermalizes according to a boltzmann distribution .",
    "the thermal radius is given by @xmath27 this radius is , in general , time - dependent since evolution proceeds for central temperatures @xmath28 and baryonic mass densities @xmath29 .",
    "dm at high density may self - annihilate to channels involving photons , leptons and light @xmath30 pairs @xcite . due to the fact that either a light or heavy self - annihilating particle in the @xmath31 mass - range may release a spark of energy able to liberate the constituent quark content of the baryons forming the very dense matter in the core of these objects , a pure nucleonic ns",
    "could then be considered a metastable state of compact stars .",
    "note that a self - annihilating @xmath32 @xmath12 particle as recently suggested in the context of direct detection experiments would , in particular , fit into this scenario .",
    "the annihilation power is then given as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dm mass density and @xmath35 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section .    if the spark seeding is able to form quark lumps or strangelets , most likely off - center , inside a volume @xmath36 they could individually grow or coalesce from a stable minimum mass number , so far poorly known , @xmath37 , according to previous estimates @xcite . in this way a _ burning front _ may proceed if particular thermodynamical conditions are fulfilled .",
    "if the burning is partial , the final configuration object would be hybrid , constitued by an inner quark matter phase and an outer nucleonic phase .",
    "however , if the burning is complete the resultant object would be formed by a pure quark phase . in both cases the final configuration in the mass - radius phase space @xmath38 , as computed from different eos using a variety of many - body effective theories @xcite , is a smaller , slightly lighter , more compact object than the initial one characterized by @xmath39 .    in figure  [",
    "fig : mr ] we show a qualitative scheme , inspired from the work by @xcite , of how the transition would produce a more compact object .",
    "the transition point , and therefore the initial configuration mass , would be influenced by the presence of spark seeding by self - annihilating dm in this model .",
    "in such a ns @xmath15 qs transition , part of the outer crust of the initial ns can be expelled , and possibly accelerated to relativistic speed , which may lead to a transient episode of high - energy emission . in the following ,",
    "we discuss a possible association of some grbs with such events .",
    "we focus on sgrbs for several reasons :    * the energetics of bright long grbs may be a challenge for this scenario , whereas typical energies of short grbs are in a much better agreement ( see  [ sect : energetics ] ) ; * a delay of at least @xmath40 yr is expected between the formation of a ns and the transition to a qs , which is too long for long grbs as supernovae within a few days have been found in association with some of these events . on the other hand",
    ", the scenario naturally leads to a broad distribution of the delay @xmath41 , allowing long delays that are necessary to explain the properties of the afterglows and host galaxies of short grbs ( see  [ sect : rate ] ) ; * the scenario naturally leads to short ( or very short ) timescales for the gamma - ray emission , pointing towards short or ultra - short grbs ( see  [ sect : duration ] ) .",
    "since 2005 and the first accurate localization of a sgrb @xcite , the redshift of an increasing number of short grbs has been measured , confirming their cosmological origin and leading to a large dispersion in the isotropic equivalent energy released in gamma - rays , @xmath42 erg @xcite .",
    "this energy is emitted by a relativistic outflow which is probably beamed within an opening angle @xmath43 so that the true energy release is @xmath44 , where the beaming factor is defined as @xmath45 unfortunately , the opening angle @xmath43 can not be easily measured in grbs .",
    "it can be estimated if a _ jet break _ is identified in the late afterglow @xcite .",
    "it is only in very rare cases that a precise constraint on @xmath43 is obtained , such as @xmath46 in grb 051221a @xcite , and even in such cases , it remains partially model - dependent .",
    "the distribution of @xmath47 for sgrbs is therefore unknown @xcite .",
    "highly beamed sgrbs with @xmath48 would lead to @xmath49 whereas larger opening angles of about @xmath50 give @xmath51 .",
    "this will remain as a major source of uncertainty in what follows . in sgrbs ,",
    "the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath52 is released in gamma - rays on a very short time scale ( @xmath53 s ) and observed well above 1 mev ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "then , the gamma - ray emission must be produced from relativistic ejecta to avoid the _ compactness problem _ : this provides a constrain on the minimum value of the lorentz factor for the emission region to be optically thin for @xmath54 annihilation @xcite .",
    "the analysis of a few pre-_fermi _ short bursts @xcite leads to @xmath55 from this @xmath54 opacity constraint @xcite . when a sgrb is detected up to the gev range by _",
    "fermi_-lat , stricter constraints are obtained , such as @xmath56 in grb 090510 @xcite .",
    "+ let us compare these constraints on the energetics and the relativistic nature of the emitting material in sgrbs with the predictions of the scenario described in the previous section .",
    "if there is a transition triggered from the inside @xcite , namely due to dm self - annihilation in the central core of a ns ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) then the final configuration may lead to a more compact object with partially deconfined quark content .",
    "the energy gap to this new configuration ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) will release approximately ( here we assume @xmath59 for the sake of comparison ) , @xmath60 note that the internal energy due to the matter equation of state has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath61 @xcite , therefore this estimate is correct up to a numerical factor that somewhat depends on the eos .",
    "the energy @xmath62 liberated in a ns@xmath15qs transition can be compared with the energy @xmath63 released in the gravitational collapse leading to the formation of a ns ( standard core - collapse supernova ) .",
    "we define this ratio ( in the approximation @xmath64 ) as @xmath65.the calculation is made assuming a transition of a hadronic type star with a combined eos model including additional hyperons @xcite to a hybrid star with a quark content described by the mit bag model",
    ". two relativistic non - linear walecka - type eos models of glendenning - moszkowsky @xcite are tested , namely , gm1 ( blue curve ) and gm3 ( red curve ) usually used to describe the hadronic phase .",
    "the typical compressibility values @xmath66 for the gm1 model are stiffer than for the gm3 model .",
    "note that in this scenario of hybrid stars the maximum mass for the hybrid object must be somewhat lower than in the case of the pure hadronic star .",
    "although both of them predict maximum hadronic stars masses somewhat on the low side with @xmath67 , ( as compared to recent measurements reporting masses of about @xmath68 @xcite ) , they can be considered illustrative to show a general trend of the typical original configurations before transitioning to hybrid or pure qss . in this figure",
    "the value of some nuclear parameters such as the s - quark mass has been taken to be @xmath69 and the strong coupling constant @xmath70 .",
    "surface tension is @xmath71 .",
    "no curvature energy has been considered .",
    "in this situation the initial configuration masses and radii are not the same , since they depend on the value of the @xmath24 bag constant in the mit model .",
    "following @xcite we consider that the transition takes place between a configuration in the initial hadronic star with gravitational mass @xmath72 and with some baryonic mass @xmath73 and that of a final hybrid object ( computed with the hybrid eos ) with the same baryonic mass , @xmath74 , since that charge is conserved .",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 are the energy density and baryonic mass density for the baryonic object .",
    "physically , the transition occurs due to the fact that as the density or central pressure exceeds a threshold value , it is energetically allowed that , at the transition point , bubbles of quark matter form .",
    "this is due to the lowering of the chemical potential in the system as more degrees of freedom are available .",
    "these lumps of quark matter can grow very rapidly , driving a burning front and the original hadronic star will be converted into a hybrid star or quark star . in the mechanism involving self - annihilating dm this",
    "energy released could be considered as _ sparks _ that would coalescence or ignite the medium and allow quark deconfinement out of the baryons present ( this is b - dependent and therefore , eos dependent in our model ) . if we further include corrections due to slightly different masses for the initial and final configurations we have @xmath77 .",
    "we typically find @xmath78 , which illustrates that the transition mechanism discussed here indeed belongs to the class of the most energetic phenomena in the universe . the efficiency @xmath79 is plotted in fig  [ fig : eos ] as a function of the bag constant @xmath80 .",
    "it shows that the efficiency @xmath79 is higher as the bag constant @xmath24 grows , pointing to heavier dm particles in order to ignite the nucleation of quark matter lumps but well in the conservative range shown in fig . 2 in @xcite .",
    "further work is needed to clarify the role of the eos in the efficiency of the transition since the possible existence of a burning front able to fully convert the ns into a qs and proceed towards higher radii is a crucial point .",
    "numerically , using typical values @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 results in @xmath84 . in the ns@xmath15qs transition",
    "most of the energy @xmath62 will be radiated as neutrinos and photons , as showed by detailed calculations @xcite . additionally gravitational radiation",
    "should also be emitted ( see  [ sect : gw ] ) .",
    "we assume now that a small fraction , @xmath85 , of this energy may be injected into the outer crust which is then ejected and becomes relativistic .",
    "the kinetic energy of the expelled crust is @xmath86 if acceleration is complete .",
    "the isotropic equivalent energy that could be radiated as gamma - rays by such an ejecta can be estimated by    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the efficiency of gamma - ray energy extraction from the ejecta and could range from @xmath89 for the extraction of kinetic energy by internal shocks @xcite to @xmath90 for photospheric emission ( see e.g * ? ? ? * ) or magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "as discussed below , relativistic motion of the ejecta is favored by a small ejected mass , @xmath91 , which corresponds typically to the outer crust .",
    "the crust is defined as the region where the density drops below nuclear saturation density ( nsd ) at @xmath92 @xmath93 , and the outer crust is limited by the neutron drip ( nd ) at @xmath94 ( see  [ sect : engine ] ) .",
    "then , the value @xmath95 used in eq .",
    "[ eq : egammiso ] would correspond for instance to a situation where 1% of @xmath62 is injected in the crust and 10% of this energy is injected preferentially in the outer crust , so that @xmath96 . as there is large uncertainty in this estimate",
    "we use a safe approximation below the @xmath97 quoted in other detailed calculations @xcite .",
    "this estimate of @xmath52 is in reasonable agreement with observations of sgrbs : the ns@xmath15qs conversion scenario investigated here can reproduce measured energies in sgrbs for @xmath98 .",
    "+ regarding the relativistic nature of the ejecta , the maximum lorentz factor , @xmath99 , that can be reached depends on the expelled fraction or ejected mass , @xmath100 , of the crust .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor can be deduced from the estimate of @xmath101 above , and from the ejected mass @xmath100 as : @xmath102 again , it seems that lorentz factors above @xmath103 , in agreement with the observational constraints described above , can be reached as long as the ejected mass remains low ( @xmath104 ) and the fraction of the energy injected in the outer crust is not too small ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "even ultra - high relativistic ejecta with @xmath106 could in principle be produced , if the ejected mass is really small .",
    "this could be the scenario where the _",
    "crust is expelled .",
    "+ we conclude that the dm self - annihilation triggered ns@xmath15qs scenario can , in principle , release enough energy to power a sgrb , and that the ejected crust can reach high lorentz factors , which is necessary to emit gamma - rays .",
    "this is however strongly dependent on the two parameters @xmath85 and @xmath100 which are very difficult to predict accurately at this stage .",
    "this will be briefly discussed in ",
    "[ sect : engine ] .",
    "assuming that the transition of a ns to a qs triggered by the self annihilation of accreted dm in the core can inject enough energy into relativistic ejecta to produce a sgrb , it is worth comparing the observed rate of these phenomena with the predicted rate of ns@xmath15qs conversions . the local rate per unit volume of sgrbs , @xmath107 ,",
    "can be estimated from their observed rate and distribution of flux using a population model ( luminosity function , comoving rate , etc ) , as has been done by @xcite , @xcite , who obtain @xmath108 the lower limit corresponds to a comoving sgrb rate that follows the cosmic star formation rate with a long delay , and the upper limit to a constant comoving rate .",
    "unfortunately , the unknown distribution of the beaming factor and its average @xmath109 is again a major source of uncertainty in this estimate .",
    "+ in the scenario presented is this work , the local rate of ns formation , estimated as the local rate of type ii supernovae , gives an _ upper limit _ for the rate of ns @xmath15 qs conversions .",
    "it is of the order of @xcite @xmath110 then the ratio of the former two rates is @xmath111 from these estimates only , one can conclude that ns @xmath15 qs transition can be much more frequent than sgrbs , depending on the fraction of ns that will experience such a transition . if all sgrbs are due to ns @xmath15 qs conversions , the low ratio obtained in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratesnii ] could be ( i ) either due to the fact that only a fraction of ns @xmath15 qs transitions lead to short grbs ; ( ii ) or be related to the fact that only a small fraction of ns are converted into qs .",
    "having only a small fraction of ns converting to a qs is expected if the delay @xmath41 between the formation of a ns and its conversion to a qs is usually long , e.g. @xmath112 several gyr . for a broad probability distribution @xmath113 of the delay @xmath41 , with a high mean value @xmath114 of the order of the hubble time ,",
    "most conversions would not have occured yet , resulting in a low ratio @xmath115 , the observed short grbs being produced by the conversions with the shortest delays . in addition , such a distribution of @xmath113 would make the scenario in good agreement with the properties of short grb afterglows and host galaxies : contrary to the case of lgrbs which are always observed in central regions of star forming galaxies @xcite , sgrbs can occur at any place ( sometimes at the periphery or outside ) in any type of galaxy @xcite .",
    "this indicates a delay between the end of the life of the massive progenitor star and the production of the short grb .",
    "it is already a well known fact that most nss are born with a natal velocity kick @xmath116 that can be as large at @xmath117 km / s @xcite .",
    "therefore , with high values of @xmath41 , not only any correlation with star formation is lost , but the ns can travel a distance @xmath118 and most likely experience the conversion to a qs far from the galactic central regions , or even outside the galaxy .    in the scenario presented here a lower limit on @xmath41",
    "can be obtained from the physics of the transition , which is triggered by self - annihilation of accreted dm from the galactic halo . in our galaxy",

    "once the steady state , resulting from competing processes of annihilation and accretion , has been reached , the elapsed time is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the volume of the star .",

    "we conclude that @xmath41 is related to the microphysical processes happening in the burning of the ns .",
    "this , in turn , depends on the ability of the compact object ( mainly related to the eos ) and environment conditions to accrete dm and , therefore , can not be simply predicted and should present some spread and extend up to a large value @xmath133 that can be constrained by observations .    in our galaxy , there are hundreds of confirmed nss , with measured radii and masses @xcite . on the other hand , the subsample of confirmed nss with an estimate of the age",
    "is very small , due to the difficulty of the age determination , based on cooling theory @xcite .",
    "it seems that nss with an age of at least @xmath134 myr are identified @xcite which would put a lower limit on the maximum value of the delay @xmath41 , @xmath135 such delays , as shown by eq .",
    "[ eq : distance ] , lead to travelled distance of the order of 10 kpc or more , reaching the outskirts of a galaxy but are still too small to de - correlate from the star formation activity .",
    "one can not of course exclude that much older nss are present in the sample of confirmed nss , which would increase @xmath136 up to 100 my or more .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed comparison with the properties of sgrb host would require the knowledge of the distribution @xmath113 , which seems yet out of reach .",
    "another possible approach to constrain the rate of ns@xmath15qs transitions in the scenario proposed here is to focus on the kinematics of observed pulsars .",
    "the pulsar tangential velocity data can be fitted with a bimodal distribution peaked around @xmath137 km / s and an upper @xmath138 km / s @xcite .",
    "the high velocity pulsars with @xmath139 roughly account for the 10@xmath140 of the pulsar population .",
    "the first peak in the distribution is believed to be due to the kick velocity given to the ns when it is formed in a core collapse supernova .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that the second higher velocity peak could be due to a _",
    "second _ kick when the ns@xmath15qs conversion takes place . in previous work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that dm seeding in nss may form a stable and long - lived strange quark matter ( sqm ) lump that could induce a partial ns conversion into a hybrid sqm star .",
    "this event may produce , as a consequence , an effect on the kinematics with a birth kick and rotation as a result of the partial burning of the ns @xcite able to produce up to @xmath141 km / s and relative changes in the angular velocity of @xmath142 as a result of the off - center mechanism driving the transition .",
    "other mechanisms quoted in the literature rely on some kind of asymetry @xcite in the front progress . from this interpretation of the observed pulsar velocity distribution , @xmath143",
    "could be taken as an upper limit for the frequency of the ns@xmath15qs transitions , leading to an upper limit for the ns@xmath15qs rate which is more constraining than in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratesnii ] , i.e. @xmath144 since this rate remains higher than the sgrb rate , at this stage the only possibility in this scenario is to to assume that only a fraction @xmath145 of ns @xmath15 qs transitions produce a short grb , leading to @xmath146 this additional factor @xmath147 can be related to internal processes , such as the capacity of the burning front to proceed to the crust ( see  [ sect : engine ] ) .",

    "however , we will show below (  [ sect : duration ] ) that this scenario naturally leads to short grb durations @xmath149 s , so that only very short grbs are good candidates for counterparts of these ns @xmath15 qs transitions .",
    "then , it reduces in principle even more the value of @xmath147 .    on the other hand , observations of afterglows of ultra - short grbs ,",
    "identifications of their host galaxy and measurements of their distance are extremely rare so that their intrinsic rate is unknown .",
    "the distribution of the duration of batse bursts show that @xmath150 of the short bursts have a duration below 100 ms @xcite .",
    "this factor can not however be directly applied to the estimate of the intrinsic rate given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ratesgrb ] . indeed",
    ", this population of very short bursts may very well be a separate group with different properties : they are usually made of a single short and hard spike with possible substructure on a timescale of a few 10 @xmath151s @xcite .",
    "the analysis ( @xmath152 and @xmath153 diagram ) of the distribution of very short bursts observed by batse and konus gives some evidence for a local origin @xcite . this is however a bit contradictory with more recent results obtained by _ swift _ : 10 very short bursts with a duration of less 100 ms have been detected by swift until june 2012 .",
    "all of these show indeed a single short duration hard spike in the bat . in many cases ,",
    "the afterglow has not been identified or is very weak at the limit of the detection ( grb 050925 , grb 051105a , grb 070209 , grb 070810b , grb 070923 , grb 090417a , grb 100628a , grb 120305a ) .",
    "there are however two very short bursts where the afterglow has been well detected and localized and where there is a good candidate for the host galaxy . in both cases , the host candidate is an early type galaxy and the afterglow shows a large offset of a few 10 kpc : grb 050509b seems to be associated to an elliptical galaxy at @xmath154 with an offset of 35 - 55 kpc @xcite ; grb 090515 is probably associated to an early type galaxy at @xmath155 with a large offset of 75 kpc @xcite .",
    "these two examples indicate a population at cosmological distance which is uncorrelated to star formation , in agreement with the discussion above .",
    "the sample is however much too small to allow for a determination of the intrinsic rate of very short grbs and an estimate of @xmath147 .",
    "in this section , we model the basis of the central engine mechanism of the internal burning front that will induce a resultant outflow with several relativistically moving emitting regions .",
    "this discussion is based on a series of works @xcite .",
    "nuclear processes involving quark deconfinement in the hadronic phase may happen if the @xmath156 @xmath12 dm particle candidate self - annihilates liberating @xmath157 photons and other light particle pair products .",
    "the corresponding lump of strange quark matter ( @xmath6 matter ) evolves towards the formation of a fireball that may cause stress and tension on the base of the inner crust of a ns .",
    "since there are only a few preliminar simulations @xcite developed so far on the full process of energy transport from the inner deconfined regions to outer regions through a burning front there is not much information where this front may stop or whether it fully proceeds to the outer crust . in these simulations",
    "the ns burning condition is dynamically analyzed showing the possibility that a hybrid star may form if the conversion front is not able to proceed as _",
    "burning_. however , a full detailed treatment has not hitherto been performed .",
    "+ in previous work @xcite , it was found that the seeding is most likely a non central process , and therefore , geometrically , the burning front progression may not be a radially symmetric dynamical process ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of a beamed ejection of the outer crust arises then from the anisotropy in the progression of the burning front .",
    "this has been somewhat explored in the work of @xcite where they discuss the possibility of preferred ejection of a fireball through the polar caps . in the present work ,",
    "we discuss the constraints on the ejected mass as a result of the ns@xmath15qs conversion .",
    "similar to what may happen in the heavy ion collision events in large colliders , a fireball may be formed and grow rapidly . then , a pure nucleonic eos of matter , would no longer be valid as nucleon quark content may be deconfined .",
    "since the newer eos is softened , later evolution may lead to the fact that the original hydrostatic structure is not longer energetically possible and re - adjustement of the object to favor lower radii and masses and then to build up tension in the crust tending to eject it and break it up .",
    "the crust mainly corresponds to matter where the density is below the nsd .",
    "therefore for lower densities a myriad of nuclei with mass number @xmath158 populate this phase .",
    "since the particular distribution of nuclei depend on the competition of short - range hadronic interaction and long range coulomb interaction a set of irregular shapes different from the spherical one can arise , forming what is known as the _ pasta phase_. as a result , low density matter in the crust of nss is mostly neutron - rich due to the deleptonization caused by neutrino escape in the first stages of cooling .",
    "its isospin content is closer to that of neutron matter than to regular nuclei where proton and neutron content are balanced @xmath159 . from the @xmath160fe iron content",
    "usually assumed in the lower density region in the crust , there is a series of neutron - rich nuclei going through heavier @xmath161ni , @xmath162ge , @xmath163sr and after this the nd transition takes place , signaling the inner crust of the ns . in the inner crust , surrounding these non - uniform pasta structures , a neutron gas is filling the system , as has been directly simulated in previous work @xcite .",
    "fragmented emission of ejecta is therefore possible since the stress in the base of the crust from a burning front may liberate the most abundant structures and the rest of lower @xmath158 nuclei .",
    "the gradient of composition ( heavy @xmath15 light ) should also produce some variability during the crust ejection , all regions of the crust being not necessarily ejected with the same lorentz factor .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty is related to the fraction of the initial energy release associated to the transition in the core which will be injected into gamma - ray photons , and the associated photo - disintegration of heavy nuclei .",
    "an efficient photo - disintegration would lead to a modified chemical composition biased towards light elements , and would enrich the medium by free neutrons that can be an additional source of energy ( neutron decay ) and internal dissipation in the ejecta ( see  [ sect : duration ] ) . in order to size the importance of this ejection , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the crust mass @xmath164 as a function of the stellar radius .",
    "these data are obtained integrating the tov @xcite equations for eight representative different eos @xcite up to the core .",
    "we compute the mass of the crust by integrating above a critical density , either the neutron drip density @xmath165 @xmath166 to estimate the mass of the outer ( solid ) crust only , or the nuclear saturation density @xmath167 @xmath168 ( where crust - core boundary sets in ) to estimate the mass of the entire crust .",
    "we find that the condition @xmath169 needed for the relativistic motion (  [ sect : energetics ] ) can be fulfilled if only the outer crust is ejected ( @xmath170 ) , whereas it becomes much more difficult if the whole crust is expelled ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the details of the physics of the propagation of the burning front and the associated energy deposition are required to estimate precisely the fraction of the crust which is ejected .",
    "if this fraction varies from a ns@xmath15qs transition to another , this would naturally lead to @xmath172 as discussed in the previous section .",
    "in this section we discuss some expected properties for sgrbs produced in the scenario proposed in this work .",
    "we focus on the identification of distinct features related to the specific central engine that could help in distinguishing this mechanism from others proposed in the literature .",
    "let us assume that the ejected outer crust has a mass @xmath173 , an initial energy @xmath174 and a width @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the light crossing time ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "the maximum final lorentz factor that can be reached in the ejection is @xmath178 due to the large physical uncertainties regarding the energy deposition in the crust and the following ejection , we do not attempt here a detailed calculation of the relativistic ejection ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a self - similar solution of the propagation of a strong shock wave within the ns and the following shock breakout ) .",
    "for a thermal acceleration , the saturation to this value of the lorentz factor will occur at radius @xmath179 assuming an initial radius @xmath180 km for the ejection .",
    "the ejecta will become transparent for its own radiation at the photospheric radius @xmath181 where we take the thomson opacity @xmath182 .",
    "here we assume @xmath183 free electron per nucleon in the expanding gas , whereas the dynamical chemical composition discussed in the previous section may lead to lower values .",
    "this does not affect too much the discussion as the dependence goes moderately as @xmath184 .",
    "this expression of @xmath185 is valid for @xmath186 .",
    "the radius @xmath187 is defined below and is of the order of a few @xmath188 cm so that the condition is always true for the typical parameters considered here .",
    "the estimates of @xmath189 and @xmath185 are based on standard fireball theory for grbs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are only rough estimates for the scenario considered here as the physics of the ejection of the crust is much more complex .",
    "we should bear in mind that the ejecta composition @xcite and fragmentation may affect both the dynamics ( @xmath189 ) and the interaction with radiation ( @xmath185 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the energy is not deposited in an homogeneous way in the expelled crust , the final lorentz factor in the ejecta may not be uniform .",
    "in addition , fragmentation of the crust during its ejection will also lead to some variability in the ejecta .",
    "if variations of @xmath190 are present on length scales @xmath191 , this will induce collisions ( internal shocks ) that will dissipate energy at a typical radius @xmath187 given by @xmath192 clearly , this possible internal dissipation will always occur well below the photosphere , and , depending on the value of the lorentz factor , even before the acceleration is complete .",
    "most of the dissipated energy should contribute again to the acceleration and the internal shock phase will only tend to smooth out the initial internal variability , without contributing to the emission",
    ".    the ejecta will expand freely initially , but will eventually be decelerated by the external medium . however , due to the expected delay between the formation of the ns and the ns @xmath15 qs transition , this external medium can correspond to the periphery of the host galaxy or even the surrounding intergalactic medium , i.e. have a low density .",
    "we assume a uniform medium with a number density @xmath193 .",
    "then the deceleration will start at radius @xmath194 @xmath195 is the proton mass . from these different estimates ,",
    "we find for the proposed scenario that @xmath196 this would naturally lead to two episodes of emission , a single spike emitted at the photosphere followed by an afterglow starting at late time due to the high value of @xmath197 .",
    "the duration of the prompt spike should be fixed by the intrinsic curvature of the emitting region and its lateral extension , which gives @xmath198 except if the ejection is highly beamed , the minimum is usually given by the first term .",
    "nevertheless , this estimate clearly points out towards short ( @xmath199 s ) and even probably very short ( @xmath200 ms , see figure  [ fig : grbnsqs ] ) grbs without any strong variability ( one main single spike ) . due to the low external density",
    ", the afterglow should rise slowly and reach a maximum around @xmath201 , i.e. a few 10 ms to a few hours after the grb , depending on the external density .",
    "in addition , the combination of a low external density and a moderate energy will naturally lead to a weak afterglow .",
    "note that if free neutrons are present in the ejecta , due to efficient photo - disintegration ( see  [ sect : engine ] ) , these neutrons will decay at a typical radius @xmath202 , fixed by the mean lifetime @xmath203 , which could lead to an early additional signature at @xmath204 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "vs efficiency of the energy injection in the crust @xmath85 , the following constraints are plotted : ( 1 ) lines of constant lorentz factor are plotted in blue for @xmath205 ( non relativistic limit ) , @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the limit @xmath209 obtained from the compactness argument ( see  [ sect : energetics ] is plotted in thick line and the forbidden region is shaded ; ( 2 ) the limit where the radius of the internal dissipation @xmath187 is equal to the radius of the photosphere is plotted in red ( most of the parameter space is well below this line , i.e. @xmath210 ) ; the limit where the observed duration of the prompt emission of photospheric origin is equal to 100 ms ( 1 s ) is plotted in magenta solid ( dashed ) line ; the limit where the observed peak energy of the photospheric emission is 100 kev is plotted in green ; the limit where the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy emitted by the photosphere is equal to @xmath211 is plotted in black . the effect of the redshift of the source on the duration and the spectrum are not included . other parameters",
    "are @xmath212 ( i.e. the width of the outer crust is 300 m ) and @xmath213 ( i.e. the ejecta is beamed within @xmath214 ) .",
    "as can be observed , a large fraction of the parameter space ( top - left region ) corresponds to ultra - relativistic outflows ( @xmath215 ) producing a very short ( @xmath216 ms ) but bright ( @xmath217 ) spike of hard ( @xmath218 kev ) photons , i.e. a very short grb . ]",
    "if most of the gamma - rays are produced at the photosphere , one should expect a thermal ( quasi - planckian ) spectrum , possibly modified at high energy by comptonization @xcite .",
    "the peak energy of the observed spectrum will then be located at @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the temperature of the photosphere .",
    "it can be computed assuming an adiabatic radial expansion from the ejection to the photosphere : @xmath221    the efficiency of the photospheric emission can also be deduced from the adiabatic evolution and equals @xmath222 .",
    "this leads to a better estimate of the isotropic equivalent energy radiated in gamma - rays , @xmath223 that stands on the lower values for grbs .",
    "of course , there is still a large uncertainty due to the unknown factors @xmath47 , @xmath224 and @xmath100 .",
    "however , these two estimates confirm the capacity to produce bright and hard spikes of gamma - rays in the considered scenario , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : grbnsqs ] where all the constraints on the prompt gamma - ray emission expected in the ns @xmath15 qs conversion scenario are summarized",
    ".    another possible signature of the scenario would be the presence of spectral features and lines associated to the specific chemical composition ( heavy elements ) of the ejected material .",
    "following the work by @xcite where @xmath225 were considered , the spectrum could be influenced below the mev range .",
    "in addition to the expected short duration burst of @xmath226-rays and x - rays and to the afterglow , it is likely that a multi - messenger approach must be followed to spot this progenitor scenario for sgrbs .",
    "the emission of gravitational waves by the merger of ns+ns or ns+bh binary is the most promising source for detectors such as virgo and ligo and their advanced versions @xcite , or the einstein telescope @xcite .",
    "the predicted emission during the three main stages of the merger has been extensively studied in the literature ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in the inspiral stage ,",
    "the signal is very well known up to the last stable orbit .",
    "then , the emission during the merger is more uncertain and must be modeled using supercomputer simulations which provide information about the gravitational waveform @xcite ( see the recent simulations by @xcite which compute the evolution of the merger up to black hole formation , including or not magnetic fields , realistic eos , etc . ) .",
    "the final ringdown stage is also very well known as the inspiral .",
    "therefore , the detection of gravitational waves in association with a sgrb would undoubtedly prove if the progenitor is a merger or not . with a horizon of @xmath227 mpc for ns+ns mergers and @xmath228 mpc for ns+bh mergers",
    ", there may be merger detections with advanced virgo , ligo@xcite ( 0.4 to 400 mergers / yr for ns+ns , a slightly smaller rate for ns+bh , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the simultaneous detection with a sgrb if the merger scenario is correct is more uncertain , both for theoretical ( beaming of the gamma - ray emission ) and instrumental ( localization of sgrbs ) reasons .",
    "the gravitational wave signature of the scenario studied here is not as well known as for compact binary mergers .",
    "it is expected that a change in the moment of inertia is caused by deformations in the ns@xmath15qs transition .",
    "some preliminary estimates of the transient gravitational wave signal from an explosive quark - hadron phase transition have been done @xcite .",
    "it could in principle be detected out to 20 mpc with advanced virgo / ligo , which makes unfortunately the probability of detection with an associated sgrb quite low , even if the intrinsic rate of very short grbs is quite uncertain ( see  [ sect : rate ] ) .",
    "the strategy for the detection of gravitational waves associated to a grb is to combine searches , already having identified typical patterns in temporal and directional coincidence with sgrbs that had sufficient gravitational - wave data available , although it is a very challenging task @xcite .",
    "an additional signal that may be used to discriminate between progenitor models for sgrbs is the neutrino emission .",
    "the specific signal expected from ns+ns mergers has been studied using supercomputer simulations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work and within the present scenario we do not attempt to describe such a neutrino emission since it crucially depends on the central engine details .",
    "however , it should be expected a neutrino flux originating from hadronic reactions happening in the central engine ( conversion in the nucleon burning front of quark deconfinement and strangeness production ) or in the ejecta ( photo - meson interactions between shock - accelerated protons / nuclei and gamma - ray photons ) .",
    "in addition , if produced neutrons do not interact they will decay being accompanied by anti - neutrinos .",
    "emission of prompt muon neutrino fluxes have been performed in some grb general scenarios @xcite and seem to be testable as recent preliminary estimated sensitivities for ice cube 86-strings quote values of @xmath229 .",
    "additionally , experiments as amanda - ii and icecube have the capability @xcite of detecting anisotropies from the emission @xcite of neutrinos from gamma ray induced air showers .",
    "therefore , as motivated , the discovery of high energy neutrinos in correlation with a sgrb and gw signal would help disentangling the current scenario .",
    "in this work we discuss the possibility that a ns@xmath15qs transition may be a central engine model for short ( @xmath230 1 s ) or more probably very short ( @xmath216 ms ) grbs .",
    "this is an alternative to the popular ns+ns or ns+bh merger scenario for sgrbs .",
    "note that this scenario is known to be compatible with observations of sgrbs but has not been proved yet , and that in addition , there are a few observations suggesting that very short bursts could be a separate population .",
    "we suggest that these very short bursts could be produced by the ejection and acceleration to relativistic speed of the ( outer ) crust of the ns during the conversion to a qs .",
    "we find that    * the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy @xmath231 can be accounted for , assuming that @xmath232 of the gravitational energy released by the transition is injected in the outer crust with , however , a large uncertainty due to the unknown beaming factor of the ejection ; * high lorentz factors , necessary for the emission of @xmath226-rays on short time - scales ( compactness problem ) , can be reached , as long as the mass of the expelled crust is less than @xmath233 ; this is attainable for the outer crust in ns models . *",
    "the rate of very short grbs can probably be reproduced , assuming that only a fraction of transitions lead to a grb and that there is on average a large delay between the formation of the ns and the conversion into a qs .",
    "such a delay is expected due to the fact that the transition is triggered by self - annihilation of dm , which needs first to be accreted in the core of the ns .",
    "such delays would then naturally at least partially suppress the correlation between star formation and very short grbs , which should be observed in any type of galaxy with a large offset ( at the present time , there are only two host galaxies of very short grbs which have been possibly identified , both being early - type , and the offset is a few 10 kpc in both cases ) ; * the prompt gamma - ray emission should be mainly produced at the photosphere , without a strong variability which should be washed out by internal dissipation at much smaller radii . * for a large fraction of the parameter space , a hard ( @xmath234 kev ) and short ( duration @xmath230 100 ms ) spike of gamma - rays is expected , in general agreement with observations of very short grbs ; * the afterglow should rise slowly and be rather weak , due to a low density of the external medium",
    ". a possible additional signature can be expected at early time if the ejected material initially contains free neutrons . *",
    "fragmentation of the ejecta arises naturally in this model since non - uniform nuclei arranged in lattice or even pasta phases are present in the low density matter .",
    "* spectral features of heavy nuclei relativistically accelerated are expected below @xmath235 mev .    to summarize , possible _ signatures _ compared to the binary ( ns , bh ) merger scenario are the shortness of the prompt gamma - ray emission , with possibly a thermal spectrum and spectral features due to the heavy composition , the associated gw emission , and possibly the properties of the host galaxies and the distribution of the afterglow position in the host , this latter signature being however difficult to characterize due to the uncertainties on the typical delay between the ns formation and the transition to a qs . clearly , a multi - wavelength / multi - messenger approach is needed to reach a firm conclusion .",
