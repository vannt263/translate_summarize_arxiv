    "recent study of small-@xmath2 physics is realized at rhic by measurements of high-@xmath3 particles in @xmath4 collisions at forward rapidities @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if a particle with mass @xmath6 and transverse momentum @xmath3 is produced in a hard reaction then the corresponding values of bjorken variable in the beam and the target are @xmath7 .",
    "thus , at forward rapidities the target @xmath1 is @xmath8- times smaller than at midrapidities .",
    "this allows to study coherent phenomena ( shadowing , color glass condensate ( cgc ) ) , which are expected to suppress particle yields .",
    "however , a significant suppression at large @xmath9 for any reaction is observed so far at any energy .",
    "namely , all fixed target experiments ( see examples in @xcite ) have too low energy for the onset of coherence effects since @xmath1 is large .",
    "the rise of suppression with @xmath9 ( with feynman @xmath0 ) shows the same pattern as observed at rhic .",
    "this allows to favor another mechanism common for all reactions arising at any energy .",
    "such a common mechanism based on energy conservation effects in initial state parton rescatterings and leading to @xmath0 scaling of nuclear effects was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the projectile hadron can be decomposed over different fock states .",
    "a nucleus has a higher resolution than a proton due to multiple interactions and so can resolve higher fock components containing more constituents .",
    "corresponding parton distributions fall off steeper at @xmath10 where any hard reaction can be treated as a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) process where no particle is produced within rapidity interval @xmath11 .",

    "the effective projectile parton distribution correlates with the nuclear target and reads & & f^(a)_q / n(x ) = cf_q / n(x ) + & & , [ 10 ] where @xmath14 is the nuclear thickness function , @xmath15 was evaluated in @xcite and the normalization factor @xmath16 is fixed by the gottfried sum rule .    in this paper",
    "we study the rise of suppression with @xmath9 ( @xmath17 ) at fnal reported by the e772 collaboration @xcite for the drell - yan ( dy ) process .",
    "we predict similar nuclear effects also at rhic in the forward region expecting the same suppression pattern as seen at fnal .",

    "the rest frame of the nucleus is very convenient for study of coherence effects .",
    "the dynamics of the dy process is regulated by the coherence length @xmath32 related to the longitudinal momentum transfer , @xmath33 , which controls the interference between amplitudes of the hard reaction occurring on different nucleons .",
