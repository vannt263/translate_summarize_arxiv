    "hd 97048 is a herbig ae / be star , member of the chamaeleon  i association , situated at 180  pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived from a photometric and spectroscopic study of hd  97048 that its infrared ( ir ) excess originates in a flattened shell structure or disk of dust particles seen pole - on .",
    "the unresolved sest image of hd  97048 taken by @xcite together with the measured mm - flux also points towards the presence of a flattened disk - like structure @xcite .",
    "the object is not extended in the near - ir on scales of @xmath4 @xcite , but it is in the mid - ir on scales of 5 - 10  @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir emission , dominated by aromatic infrared emission bands @xcite , is most probably due to an extended envelope of transiently heated very small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "however , @xcite have recently spatially resolved the 10 @xmath2 m emission of the central source , showing that most of the emission in the 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7 @xmath2 m features comes in fact from a region of 1.2 - 1.6@xmath5 or 200 - 300 au , very likely a disk .",
    "the spectra of hd  97048 show , next to the infrared emission bands at 3.3 @xmath2 m  attributed to pahs , the rare emission features at 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath2 m  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed to attribute these bands to diamond surface c - h stretching features ; an identification which , because of the good match between laboratory and observed spectra , is very persuasive .",
    "nanodiamonds are the most abundant presolar grains in primitive meteorites , and they could in fact constitute an important component of the dust in circumstellar environments and in the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the diamond particles in hd  97048 or elias  1 are probably much larger ( size of @xmath01050 nm or larger ) than the `` true '' nanodiamonds ( mean sizes of the order of 23 nm ) observed in primitive meteorites @xcite .",
    "one way to better understand the properties and evolution of diamond particles is to study the spatial distribution of their emission . presently , the only observational constraints one has come from speckle observations by @xcite who found that the emission in the 3.53 @xmath2 m  band in hd  97048 is unresolved and arises from a region @xmath60@xmath11 in diameter . here , we present adaptive optics high angular resolution ( @xmath00@xmath11 ) spectroscopic observations of hd  97048 .",
    "these observations allow us to spatially resolve for the first time the 3 @xmath2 m  features attributed to diamonds , as well as the adjacent continuum . in sect.2 , we present the observations . the results are presented in sect . 3 and discussed in sect .",
    "long slits spectra in the l - band ( 3.23.76 @xmath2 m ) of hd  97048 were taken on 10 january 2003 with the adaptive optics ( ao ) system naos - conica ( naco ) at the vlt , using the visible 14@xmath714 shack - hartmann wave - front sensor working at nearly 500hz .",
    "the 28@xmath5 long slit had a width of 0@xmath1086 which roughly corresponds to the diffraction limit while the pixel scale was @xmath00@xmath10547 and the spectral resolution @xmath0700 .",
    "we took 7 slit positions : one centered on the star and the others at 0@xmath1043 , 0@xmath1086 , 0@xmath1129 and -0@xmath1043 , -0@xmath1086 , -0@xmath1129 off axis .",
    "for each slit position , in order to correct from the atmospheric and instrumental background , we employed standard chop / nod technique with a throw of @xmath09  in the north - south direction .",
    "the integration time per chop- or nod - positions was 1  min .",
    "the log of the observational conditions reports a fried parameter @xmath8 close to 10 cm ( at 500 nm ) , an average outer - scale @xmath9 of @xmath015 m , and a resulting average coherent energy ( after ao correction and at 2.2 @xmath2 m ) of up to 40% on axis .",
    "the latter roughly gives the actual strehl ratio characterizing the quality of our data . according to simultaneous measurements , the seeing ( at 500 nm ) was @xmath01@xmath11 consistent with the naco values .",
    "our observations clearly benefit from good seeing conditions and ao correction , and the achieved angular resolution was close to the diffraction limit .",
    "data reduction was performed using firstly a standard procedure for ir spectroscopic observations ( pre - processing phase ) , and then a classical richardson - lucy ( lr ) deconvolution method . during the pre - processing phase , to remove the telluric features we used the observations of a spectroscopic standard star ( hip 53074 ) taken on 20 february 2003 , with the same airmass . for the deconvolution procedure , and to have a suitable estimate of the point - spread function ( psf ) , we used instead a second reference star ( hip 20440 ) , observed on 19 january 2003 , which provided a better match to our object in terms of atmospheric turbulence conditions ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , seeing ) , and ao correction quality ( k - band strehl ratio @xmath030% ) .",
    "fig .  [ spectra ] shows the spectrum obtained by combining all the slits and for distances from the star going from 0 to 1 .",
    "it clearly shows the two strong features at 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath2 m , attributed to diamonds .",
    "the features are not smooth , but show a number of components , in particular , the 3.41 , 3.43 , 3.50 , 3.51 and 3.53 @xmath2 m  ones . these characteristics support the identification of the carriers of the two features as diamonds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectrum shows also a weaker feature at 3.3 @xmath2 m , characteristic of pahs .",
    "there may be also some hydrogen emission lines ; the pf  @xmath10 on top of the broad pah feature at 3.3 @xmath2 m  and the pf  @xmath11 line at 3.74 @xmath2 m .    in fig.[spectra ] , we also compare our spectrum with that obtained with the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on board the infrared space observatory ( iso ) with a slit of 20@xmath733 .",
    "the iso - sws spectrum contains both the disk and emission from the reflection nebula that surrounds the system @xcite . comparing the two spectra",
    ", we see that the diamond components are very similar in peak position , width and relative strength .",
    "moreover , the peak / continuum ratio in the diamond bands is roughly similar .",
    "this suggests that diamond emission is confined to the disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the iso spectrum shows stronger pah emission at 3.3 @xmath2 m than the naco one , consistent with the hypothesis that the pah feature seen in the iso spectrum comes from both the disk and the surrounding nebula @xcite .",
    "[ cut ] shows the intensity profile ( after continuum subtraction ) of the two 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath2 m  features along the slit length . the intensity profile in the slit centered on the star and at 0@xmath1043",
    "have been averaged together because the star was offset by approximately 1/4 of slit ( i.e. , @xmath00.02 , see fig .",
    "[ map ] ) .",
    "[ cut ] also shows the intensity profile of the continuum ( measured between 3.6 and 3.7 @xmath2 m ) and of the observed reference star ( the assumed psf ) .",
    "the spatial extent of the diamond emission in both the 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath2 m  features is significantly broader than that of the continuum , which is slighlty broader , in turn , than the psf .",
    "note that since the psf data resulted in a slightly worse strehl ratio ( see sect .",
    "2 ) than the object data , it is unlikely that the apparent extension of the continuum is due to an additional broadening from the combination of atmospheric conditions and partial ao correction .",
    "the pah emission appears to be more extended than the diamond features ; it will be discussed in details in a forthcoming paper presenting other naco observations of the 3.3 @xmath2 m  pah emission band in herbig ae / be stars .    as discussed above , the fact that both the diamond features and the continuum emission are resolved is clearly visible already in the pre - processed data .",
    "nevertheless , in order to better estimate the exact spatial extensions and eliminate , as far as possible , the remaining atmospheric and post - ao broadening effects on the profiles , we have applied to the data a classical lr deconvolution method . in practice",
    "this was performed using the software package airy @xcite . in order to avoid gibbs oscillations ( also known as  ringing  effect ",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the rather flat central feature of the data at 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath2 m  we have stopped our lr iterative method after 10 iterations , while for the continuum data we have performed a maximum of 100 iterations since no ringing effect appeared .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[cut_deconvol ] , from which we derive a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 0@xmath118 ( or 32  au ) for the diamond features , and of 0@xmath113 ( or 23  au ) for the continuum emission .",
    "these results are consistent with a simple quadratic subtraction assuming gaussian light distribution in the pre - processed data .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio on the spatiale emission profiles is very high ( greater than 100 ) and the theoretical error on the fwhm from gaussian fits is less that 1% .",
    "this is clearly an underestimate of the real uncertainties of our measurement .",
    "errors on the fwhm values are dominated by systematic errors at the level of 10 to 20% .",
    "the spatial extension derived here for the 3.53 @xmath2 m  band is larger by almost a factor of 2 than the upper limit inferred by @xcite .",
    "however , the 3.53 @xmath2 m  emission feature is spatially unresolved in their speckle observations performed at the anglo - australian 3.9-m telescope ( with a diffraction limit of @xmath120@xmath12 ) .",
    "the derived upper limit assumes an amount of super - resolution ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that is hardly compatible with the modest signal - to - noise ratio caused by a seeing value of 3  and no ao correction . on the contrary",
    ", the spatial extension we derive here is approximatively twice the diffraction - limit of the 8.2-m vlt .",
    "nevertheless , further accurated ao - assisted 2d imaging with naco should be performed to confirm our size estimates .",
    "because of the way the slits were positioned and the chop / nod procedure used , we have a 2d coverage of the plane of the sky for a region of 0.26@xmath74 , about 47@xmath7720  au .",
    "[ map ] shows the map of the emission of the 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath2 m  features and of the continuum .",
    "these maps were obtained by deconvolving independently the data obtained for each of the 7 slit positions , and hence recomposing the 7 slit vectors into 8 resulting pixels ( each slit was shifted by a value that is half the width of the slit itself during the observations ) .    both in the features and in the continuum , the emission is roughly spherical , with fwhm sizes of about 0.18@xmath70.18 , 32@xmath732 au in the features , and 0.13@xmath70.13 , 23@xmath723 au in the continuum , as derived in sect .",
    "3.2.1 from the analysis of the central slits .",
    "the slight difference between the 3.43 and 3.53 band maps is not significant , given the uncertainties of the data .",
    "our naco / vlt observations allow us to resolve for the first time the emission in the diamond features ( and the adjacent continuum ) in a pre - main  sequence star .",
    "the fwhm sizes we derive are typical of emission arising in a circumstellar disk , as we will see in the following ; the roughly spherical shape of the emission maps confirms the hypothesis of a pole - on disk in hd  97048 put forward by @xcite .    models of the intensity profile expected from flared circumstellar disks around herbig ae / be stars , similar to hd  97048 , have been recently computed by @xcite .",
    "the models include large grains , in thermal equilibrium with the stellar radiation field , as well as transiently heated small graphite grains and pahs , but not diamonds .",
    "these models show that the continuum emission at @xmath03 @xmath2 m is dominated by warm large ( size of @xmath00.1 @xmath2 m ) grains at thermal equilibrium ; when convolved with a psf of fwhm@xmath13 , the intensity profile is only slightly bigger than the psf , as in our observations .    in all models ,",
    "the emission of transiently heated particles is significantly broader than that of the large grains at the same frequency .",
    "this is easily understood when considering the different excitation mechanism , and is discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is evidence in hd  97048 that the mid - ir pah emission is extended on a scale of 1.2 - 1.6  or 200 - 300 au @xcite , comparable to the outer disk radii seen at millimeter wavelengths in similar systems @xcite .",
    "the more extended emission seen by @xcite must come , instead , from a surrounding nebula .",
    "the diamond emission is extended more than the continuum emission , but less than the pah emission .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the idea that the diamond carrier of the 3 @xmath2 m  features observed in hd 97048 have sizes intermediate between those of large grains and of pahs , as suggested by detailed analysis of the iso spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "self consistent models which explore the effect of diamond properties and disk geometry are required to make a useful comparison with observations .",
    "the results presented in this letter add an important piece of information to the studies of the properties of circumstellar disks and of the nature of the solid particles they contain .",
    "for the first time , we were able to resolve the inner disk emission in the herbig ae / be star hd  97048 , to show that the disk is seen pole - on , confirming previous indirect evidence , to resolve the rare emission in the two features at 3.43 and 3.54 @xmath2 m attribute to diamonds and to prove beyond doubts their origin in the inner region ( @xmath3 au ) of the disk .",
    "we also show as solid vertical lines the diamond feature positions and as vertical dotted lines the position of the pf  @xmath10 line ( on top of the broad pah feature at 3.3@xmath2 m ) and the pf  @xmath11 line at 3.74 @xmath2 m . ]",
    "m  diamond features ( continuum substracted , solid lines ) as function of the distance from the star .",
