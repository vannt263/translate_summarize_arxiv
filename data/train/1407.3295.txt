    "the kodaira vanishing theorem is one of the most useful results in algebraic geometry . besides the original differential - geometric proof by kodaira @xcite and the famous algebraic proof by deligne and illusie @xcite , there are at least two other proofs that are based on hodge theory .",

    "saito s vanishing theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* g ) is a generalization of kodaira s theorem to mixed hodge modules ; it contains as special cases several other results , such as kollr s vanishing theorem for higher direct images of dualizing sheaves .",
    "more precisely , saito uses artin s vanishing theorem for perverse sheaves on affine varieties to obtain a vanishing theorem for the graded quotients of the de rham complex of any graded - polarizable mixed hodge module ; his proof is therefore a distant cousin of ramanujam s . in this paper , we show that saito s theorem can also be proved by the method of esnault and viehweg : the key point is to exploit the strictness of direct images on certain branched coverings .",
    "the argument is perhaps less elegant than saito s , but it has two advantages :    1 .",
    "the vanishing theorem follows from results about polarizable hodge modules , without appealing to vanishing theorems for perverse sheaves .",
    "2 .   the result can be stated and proved entirely in terms of pure hodge modules , without the need for using mixed hodge modules .",
    "since mixed hodge modules are more complicated than pure ones , the second point may be useful to someone who is trying to understand saito s vanishing theorem with a minimum of theoretical background .",
    "those who are interested in the original proof can also consult popa s expository paper @xcite .",

    "the general idea , explained for example in @xcite , is to deduce vanishing theorems from the @xmath35-degeneration of certain spectral sequences .    as a motivation for what follows ,",

    "the line bundle @xmath37 becomes very ample , and we can find a smooth divisor @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "such a divisor determines a branched covering @xmath40 ( see ) , and one can show that @xmath41 now @xmath42 is again a smooth projective variety , and so its hodge - de rham spectral sequence degenerates at @xmath35 ; in particular , the mapping @xmath43 is equal to zero . from this , one can deduce that the restriction mapping @xmath44 is also equal to zero : the key point is that @xmath45 induces a @xmath46-linear mapping @xmath47 , whose composition with the residue mapping is , up to a constant factor , equal to the @xmath8-linear mapping @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , @xmath49 must be surjective ; because of serre duality , @xmath50 must be injective .",

    "we then take a sufficiently generic branched covering @xmath40 , and use the strictness of direct images for polarizable hodge modules to prove that @xmath54 must be injective for @xmath53 . because the complex @xmath55 is concentrated in non - positive degrees , we can again kill the right - hand side by taking @xmath51 .",
    "this proves half of ; the other half follows by sere duality , because the de rham complex is compatible with the duality functor ( see ) .",
    "i wrote this paper for those who already know the definitions and basic results from the theory of polarizable hodge modules @xcite .",
    "if you are not familiar with saito s theory , but nevertheless interested in the proof of the vanishing theorem , i would recommend taking a look at saito s nicely - written survey article @xcite or at the more recent @xcite .",
    "two of the results that we need  about hodge modules on singular varieties and about non - characteristic inverse images  are distributed among several of saito s papers ; in the interest of readability , i therefore decided to include an outline of their proof .",
    "please note that i chose to use left @xmath5-modules throughout : this is more convenient when working with inverse images and simplifies certain arguments with differential forms . however , because saito uses right @xmath5-modules , a little bit of translation is needed when looking up results in @xcite .",
    "the rules are as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath56 is a filtered left @xmath5-module on an @xmath57-dimensional complex manifold @xmath2 .",

    "the conventions for indexing the @xmath65-filtration are also different for left and right @xmath5-modules . in the case of @xmath6 ,",

    "the idea is to embed @xmath0 into a complex manifold @xmath2 ( such as projective space ) , and then to define @xmath74 as the full subcategory of all graded - polarizable mixed hodge modules on @xmath2 whose support is contained in @xmath0 . to make this definition meaningful , one has to show that the resulting category does not depend on the embedding",

    ", such embeddings may only exist locally , and so one has to cover @xmath0 by embeddable open subsets and work with collections of mixed hodge modules on the open sets that are compatible on intersections . this idea is developed in @xcite .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath77 is an abelian category .",
    "the main result is that this category does not depend on the choice of embedding .",
    "[ prop : independence ] given two embeddings @xmath78 and @xmath79 , one has a canonical equivalence of categories between @xmath77 and @xmath80 .    the tool for proving this is the following version of kashiwara s equivalence for mixed hodge modules .",
    "[ prop : kashiwara ] let @xmath81 be a closed embedding between two complex manifolds . for any closed analytic subspace @xmath78 , the direct image functor @xmath82 induces an equivalence of categories between @xmath77 and @xmath83 .",

    "* lemme  5.1.9 ) for pure hodge modules , and asserted in @xcite for mixed ones . the essential point is to show that the underlying filtered @xmath5-module @xmath4 of a mixed hodge module @xmath84 comes from @xmath2 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "this follows from a more general result for coherent @xmath5-modules in kashiwara s thesis ; in order to deal with the filtration @xmath7 , one has to use one of the axioms characterizing mixed hodge modules ( * ? ? ?",

    "now let us prove .",
    "since we can not directly compare @xmath2 and @xmath42 , we use the product embedding @xmath85 , as in the following diagram : @xmath86{drr}{j } \\arrow[bend right=30]{ddr}{i } \\\\ & x \\times y \\dar{p } \\rar{q } & y \\\\ & x \\end{tikzcd}\\ ] ] because the situation is symmetric , it suffices to show that the direct image functor @xmath87 is an equivalence of categories . note that @xmath88 is obviously faithful : in fact , this is true for the underlying perverse sheaves because @xmath89 is an isomorphism on the image of @xmath0 , and the functor from mixed hodge modules to perverse sheaves is faithful .",

    "let @xmath90 be a graded - polarizable mixed hodge module whose support is contained in @xmath91 . to construct from @xmath27 an object on @xmath92 , we use the existence of good local sections for @xmath89 .",
