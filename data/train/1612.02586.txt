    "quantum field theory in curved spacetime offers a first step to merge quantum mechanics and einstein s general relativity into a consistent theory leaving the metric tensor unquantized @xcite .",
    "investigations carried out by parker @xcite and zeldovich and starobinsky @xcite showed , that due to quantum effects particles are created by the expansion of spacetime .",
    "particle creation by the changing time - dependent spacetime is also the driving mechanism behind hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "although these investigations were carried out in the last century , gravitational particle creation still remains as an active area of current research @xcite .    according to the standard picture ,",
    "the universe is modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic system described by friedmann - robertson - walker metric @xcite .",
    "moreover , the very early universe is usually supposed to be very hot and radiation dominated .",
    "however , at very early times after the big bang there is little or no evidence that the universe had to be radiation dominated and it is possible that it was filled with some more exotic type of matter .",
    "one of these possibilities , and an interesting one , is that the early universe was dominated by stiff matter .",
    "the possibility of an early stiff matter era was presumably first considered by zeldovich when he considered the consequences of an equation of state of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the energy density and @xmath2 the pressure of the fluid @xcite .",
    "indeed , the stiff equation of state exhibits several interesting cosmological properties worth investigating @xcite .",
    "the presence of stiff matter in the very early universe has also implications on the abundance of relic particle species produced after the big bang due to the expansion and cooling of the universe @xcite and it may help explaining baryon asymmetry and density perturbations of the right amplitude for the formation of large - scale structures in our universe @xcite . because of these important aspects , stiff matter cosmology has received renewed attention among scientists @xcite .",
    "the inflationary paradigm states that our universe underwent a rapid expansion phase in the very early stages of its evolution .",
    "it is very compelling since it is able to solve a number of problems that non - inflationary cosmology is incapable of doing .",
    "these include the horizon problem , flatness of the universe and cosmic relic problems @xcite . also , the inflationary paradigm is essential in explaining the structures of observed universe @xcite . stiff matter also ties in closely with inflation , since a scalar field behaves like a stiff fluid when its energy density is dominated by its kinetic energy .",
    "recently , a number of models have been presented where cosmological particle production takes place at the end of an inflatory period when the universe suffers an abrupt phase transition to the stiff matter dominated phase @xcite . in these models",
    "the particle production is calculated at the transition time when the universe changes phase to the stiff matter era .",
    "this approximation however , does not take into account what really happens with the particle creation when the universe expands in the stiff matter phase .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond the existing models which deal with gravitational particle creation with stiff matter .",
    "first , we present an exactly solvable model for particle creation in a stiff matter dominated universe in a more general setting .",
    "secondly , we calculate the energy density of these created particles taking into account also the dilution effect coming from the expansion of the universe .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we present the theoretical framework needed in our analysis of gravitational particle creation .",
    "we present a model for particle creation in the stiff matter dominated universe in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] and study how it is dependent on the mass and momentum of a given field .",
    "we also compute the energy densities of the created particles and the background and find an upper bound for the temperature of the particles in thermal equilibrium . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] we discuss the results .",
    "natural units @xmath3 are used throughout this article and the signature of the metric is chosen with positive time component .",
    "in this article we consider a universe dominated by stiff matter .",
    "the equation of state for this ideal fluid is given by the stiff matter relation @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is the pressure and @xmath1 is the energy density of the fluid .",
    "furthermore , we restrict our study to a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . assuming zero cosmological constant , the dynamics",
    "is governed by einstein s equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ricci tensor , @xmath7 the ricci scalar , @xmath8 the energy - momentum tensor and the gravitational constant is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , if the matter is modeled by a perfect fluid with total energy density @xmath10 , the friedmann equation @xmath11 determines the time - evolution of the scale factor @xmath12 .    in the case",
    "we are considering the total energy density is comprised of the background energy density @xmath13 , corresponding to the stiff matter , from the energy density @xmath14 of the massive scalar particles @xmath15 and the density @xmath1 of some ordinary relativistic particles . in the early stages when particle creation has not yet began , we suppose that the energy densities @xmath16 and @xmath1 can be neglected , i.e. , the universe is stiff matter dominated , @xmath17 . as the universe expands the energy of the stiff matter is converted to the scalar particles @xmath15 when @xmath13 decreases until at some time @xmath18 the energy densities @xmath14 and @xmath13 will become equal ending the stiff matter dominated era .",
    "supposing that the scalar particles decay to relativistic degrees of freedom it is possible to evaluate their temperature as the energy density of these relativistic particles is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the number of relativistic effective degrees of freedom . using eq .",
    "we can obtain an upper bound for the temperature of the particles in thermal equilibrium as @xmath21^{1/4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the equality is valid whenever the scalar particles decay and thermalize very fast .",
    "after the ordinary particles have thermalized , the universe has entered the conventional radiation dominated era .",
    "the next step is to describe the production of massive scalar particles during the stiff matter dominated era .",
    "these particles are described as excitations of quantum fields propagating in a classical background . in curved space",
    "the klein - gordon equation for a massive free scalar field @xmath15 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the field , @xmath24 a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath7 is the ricci scalar and the covariant dalembert operator is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "we use the conformal coupling , where @xmath26 in four spacetime dimensions .",

    "the annihilation operator defines a vacuum state @xmath33 through @xmath34 associated to the basis @xmath27 .",

    "any two sets of modes are related by a bogoliubov transformation @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are known as bogoliubov coefficients @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the modes @xmath27 are separable into space and time dependent factors , then the bogoliubov coefficients fulfill the relations @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the relation can be expressed modewise as @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 .    in any case , the creation and annihilation operators of two different bases are related via a corresponding bogoliubov transformation , so that the expectation value of the particle number operator @xmath49 of the modes @xmath27 in the vacuum of @xmath35 modes is given by the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath44 as @xmath50 thus , two observers at rest in distinct coordinate systems ( with mode expansions @xmath27 and @xmath35 ) would see different particle content of the universe .",
    "since the notion of a vacuum state in curved space is ambiguous , a question arises on how to define a physical vacuum state . in frw universe a well - known vacuum state based on adiabatic field modes",
    "is given by the so - called adiabatic vacuum state first introduced by parker @xcite .",
    "in general finding the field modes reguires solving the klein - gordon equation for a given metric .",
    "for spatially flat frw metric the field modes can be separated into time and space factors . using the conformal time @xmath51 given by @xmath52 ,",
    "the modes can be written as @xmath53 so that the eq . reduces to a set of equations for time - dependent harmonic oscillators @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the conformal scale factor .",
    "the normalization of these modes is equivalent to the wronskian condition @xmath57 .",

    "solutions for eq . can be approximated by iteration , but if the spacetime is slowly varying , i.e. , @xmath61 for all @xmath62 , the iterated , adiabatic modes become exact .",
    "to proceed , we consider a four - dimensional spatially flat robertson - walker universe for which the line element is given by @xmath63 with the conformal factor @xmath64 here @xmath65 is a positive constant controlling the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "the model describes a stiff matter filled universe and the standard time scale factor @xmath66 and the energy density @xmath13 for the stiff matter as @xmath67 .    by inserting the metric into the klein - gordon equation",
    "we obtain a differential equation @xmath68 equation reduces to an airy differential equation @xcite with the solution @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants which are determined by the wronskian condition .",
    "the spacetime is slowly varying in the asymptotic future so that the adiabatic modes become exact . using asymptotic formulae for the airy functions and comparing them with eq .",
    "we can recognize that normalized positive modes in the asymptotic future are @xmath72 on the other hand the normalized positive modes near the initial time @xmath73 are recognized as @xmath74 these two sets of modes are related by the bogoliubov transformation as @xmath75 keeping the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 constant and taking the derivative with respect to the conformal time in eq .",

    "we ensure that the normalization of the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath78 is in force at all times @xcite . for the square of the absolute value of the coefficient @xmath77",
    "we obtain    @xmath79 and @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the derivatives of the airy functions . equation gives the number of created particles of the mode @xmath82 up to the time @xmath51 .",

    "first of all , given that we have not taken into account the decay rate of the scalar particles , the actual equilibrium temperature might be much lower than the temperature obtained with the made assumptions . depending on how fast the scalars decay , the universe might be dominated by ordinary matter for some time before radiation domination is achieved .",
    "also , after the equilibrium time @xmath18 there is still some stiff matter left .",
    "however , since it scales as @xmath129 it is quickly diluted away . secondly , by fixing the initial time @xmath101 in the scalar particle energy density to be the planck time @xmath106 , we have assumed that the universe emerged as stiff matter dominated . moving the initial time forward in time has consequences on the energy density and hence on the equilibrium temperature .",

    "the temperature needs to be high enough to be physically sound .",
    "technically there is no problem in reaching the desired temperatures however , since increasing the parameter @xmath65 these can easily be reached . however , realistic @xmath65 parameter values remain to be determined .",
    "gravitational particle creation during a stiff matter dominated era has not been studied exhaustively and the few instances where it has appeared deal with inflationary situations @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the particle creation process is very different , since it takes place during an abrupt phase transition at the end of inflation to the stiff matter era . in our model the particles",
    "are produced during the stiff matter era also taking into account the expansion of the universe .",

    "the model we have presented in this paper offers a novel approach to gravitational particle creation in a stiff matter dominated universe opening up new and interesting aspects regarding particle creation . along the way we made some simplifying approximations , which can be considered in greater detail .",
