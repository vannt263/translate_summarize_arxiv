    "the photoproduction of pions near threshold has been a topic of considerable experimental and theoretical activities over the past years , ever since the saclay @xcite and mainz @xcite groups showed that the data for the reaction @xmath4 were at variance with the predictions of a low energy theorem ( let ) , which was derived in the early 70 s by de baenst @xcite and vainshtein and zakharov @xcite .",
    "being based on fundamental principles like lorentz , gauge and chiral symmetry , this let predicted the threshold amplitudes in form of a power series in @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the masses of pion and nucleon , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy between the theoretical expectations and the experimental data was eventually explained by bernard et al .",
    "@xcite by an explicit one - loop calculation in ( relativistic ) chpt .",
    "it was shown that the flaw of the let was in the assumption that the amplitudes would be analytical functions in @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , they contain logarithmic terms which cancel in the final result but whose expansion leads to previously unexpected contributions to the power series in @xmath8 . in the following years , calculations were considerably refined by introducing the heavy baryon formalism to chpt , leading to a well - defined expansion in @xmath8 , and by including higher orders in the chiral expansion , up to order @xmath9 in the @xmath10-wave multipole @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the @xmath13-wave multipoles @xcite . to that order there",
    "appear 3 low - energy constants , which have to be fitted to the data or estimated by resonance saturation . while there is some doubt concerning the convergence of the loop expansion for the @xmath10-waves , the expansion for the @xmath13-waves seems to converge rather well .",
    "moreover , two combinations of the @xmath13-waves are free of low energy constants , leading to new lets to order @xmath12 . on the experimental side ,",
    "new precision data have been obtained by both the taps collaboration at mainz @xcite and the sascatoon @xcite group .",
    "these experiments come closer to threshold than previously possible and clearly show that the strength of the @xmath10-wave multipole is reduced by nearly a factor 2 as compared to the old let .",
    "the calculations of chpt describe the data quite nicely .",
    "however , there remains the question of the convergence of the loop expansion .",
    "concerning the production of charged pions , the theoretical description is in much better shape .",
    "the dominant contribution near threshold is the kroll - ruderman term @xcite , and corrections up to @xmath14 have recently been calculated in chpt @xcite . in that case loop corrections",
    "are fairly small , which offers the possibility to determine the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath15 by new precision experiments .",
    "it is the aim of this letter to investigate the threshold production of neutral and charged pion by means of dispersion relations at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the free parameters of this approach have been fitted to experiments in the energy range from 160 mev to about 420 mev , i.e. we predict the threshold behaviour on the basis of the data at the higher energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : thr ] , we summarize the kinematics and the observables for pion photoproduction . some information on dispersion relations at fixed @xmath0 is given in section  [ sec : disp ] , together with a brief discussion of the assumptions and parameters involved in our calculations .",
    "we then discuss the predictions of dispersion theory for threshold pion production in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings and present some conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath16 the 3-momenta of photon and pion in the @xmath17 frame will be denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we will use @xmath20 to describe the scattering angle , @xmath21 for the @xmath17 energy of the @xmath22 system , and @xmath23 for the lab energy of the incident photon . in the following",
    "we will give the multipole expansion for the pertinent observables taking into account only the @xmath10-wave multipoles @xmath11 and the 3 @xmath13-waves @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ". we note , however , that our numerical results in section [ sec : results ] include the higher partial waves as well . for convenience",
    "we also introduce the combinations @xmath27    with these definitions and approximations , the differential cross section in the @xmath17 frame reads @xcite @xmath28    where    @xmath29",
    "leading to the total cross section    @xmath30    the single - polarization observables are the beam asymmetry ,    @xmath31    the target asymmetry    @xmath32    and the recoil polarization    @xmath33    where    @xmath34    the isospin decomposition of the physical amplitudes @xmath35 is given by the linear combinations @xmath36",
    "assuming analyticity and unitarity , the invariant amplitudes @xmath37 for pion photoproduction may be written as the sum of pole contributions and dispersion integrals . since the mandelstam variable @xmath0 is kept fixed , the integral runs over the energy variable @xmath10 from @xmath22 threshold to infinity .",
    "though it is generally difficult to prove the validity of dispersion relations , oehme and taylor @xcite have given such a proof in this case , at least for sufficiently small values of @xmath0 .",
    "as usual in this context , the pole terms are given by the born terms in pseudoscalar pion - nucleon coupling .",
    "this may seem to be at variance with the well - established fact that pseudovector coupling should be preferred because of chiral symmetry .",
    "however , both approaches lead to the same contributions at the pole , and the violation of chiral symmetry by using the pseudoscalar coupling for the born terms will be removed by appropriate contributions of the dispersion integral .",
    "starting from these fixed-@xmath0 dispersion relations for the invariant amplitudes of pion photoproduction , the projection of the multipole amplitudes leads to a well known system of integral equations @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 stands for any of the multipoles @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the corresponding ( nucleon ) pole term .",
    "the kernels @xmath42 are known , and the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes are related by unitarity . in the energy region below two - pion threshold , unitarity is expressed by the final state theorem of watson @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the corresponding @xmath22 phase shift and @xmath45 an integer .",
    "for completeness we note that eq .",
    "( [ watson ] ) assumes that the compton phase may be neglected , which could introduce systematical errors at the level of one percent . the further numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) with the constraints imposed by unitarity follows the method of schwela et al .",
    "in addition we have taken account of the coupling to higher states neglected in that earlier reference . at the energies above two - pion threshold up to @xmath46 gev , eq .",
    "( [ watson ] ) has been replaced by an ansatz based on unitarity @xcite .",
    "though this ansatz is by no means unique , it was motivated by a comparison with the existing data at the higher energies .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the contribution of the dispersive integrals from @xmath47 gev to infinity is largely dominated by @xmath0-channel exchange . in earlier references @xcite the high - energy behavior",
    "has been simulated by contributions of regge trajectories .",
    "this involved a large number of free parameters which had to be fitted to the existing data with large error bars .",
    "since we will restrict our calculations to energies @xmath48 450 mev , the main @xmath0-channel contribution should be due to ( a fraction of ) @xmath49- and @xmath50-exchange , described by four coupling parameters .",
    "furthermore , we have to allow for the addition of solutions of the homogeneous equations to the coupled system of eq .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) .",
    "the whole procedure introduces 10 free parameters , which have to be determined by a fit to the data . in our data base",
    "we have included the recent mami experiments for @xmath51 and @xmath52 production off the proton in the energy range from 160 mev to 420 mev @xcite , both older and more recent data from bonn for @xmath52 production off the proton @xcite , and older frascati @xcite and more recent triumf data @xcite on @xmath53 production off the neutron .    in cases of weak coupling between the respective channels we neglected",
    "some of the integral kernels @xmath42 in our fitting procedure .",
    "therefore we iterated the full integral equations ( [ inteq ] ) to ensure consistency of the method . at low energies",
    "the only cases where we found a significant discrepancy between our original solution and the result after iteration , were the @xmath11 amplitudes for neutral pion production .",
    "for this there are several reasons .",
    "first of all we expect strong effects from isospin breaking and unitarity for the @xmath10-wave amplitude near threshold . in our approach",
    "the assumption of isospin symmetry is quite essential when we impose the phases of the partial waves according to eq .",
    "( [ watson ] ) .",
    "however , we introduce some isospin breaking by hand via the mass difference of charged and neutral pions .",
    "second , the @xmath11 amplitudes of neutral pion production are sums of large contributions with strong cancelations ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : e0p ] ) between the large ( pseudoscalar ! ) born term and the dispersive integrals . as a consequence slight variations of these contributions can strongly affect the final results .",
    "as can be seen from tab .  [ tab : e0p ] ,",
    "the @xmath10-waves of charged pion production at threshold are mainly given by the pole term contributions , while there are only small corrections from the dispersion integrals .",
    "in particular there is a strong cancelation between the ( large ) @xmath54 contributions to the @xmath55 and @xmath56 components entering into the linear combination @xmath57 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ iso_dec ] ) ) . in @xcite",
    "this contribution had been determined to be 0.05@xmath58 , assuming only the @xmath59 amplitude to contribute . according to our result",
    "this contribution is 0.09@xmath58 .",
    "more interesting is the fact , that the contribution of the @xmath60 multipole which was neglected in @xcite is much larger ( 0.27@xmath58 ) .",
    "we also stress that the @xmath2 contribution determined in this way differs even in sign from the corresponding value of -0.57@xmath61 which has been derived in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) @xcite",
    ". however , such differences in individual terms are not unexpected , because there is no unique correspondence between the graphology of perturbation and dispersion theory .",
    "the first prediction for the threshold values of charged pion production was a let stating that the @xmath10-wave multipoles are given by the kroll ",
    "ruderman term @xcite , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , where we assumed @xmath64 .",
    "recently , corrections to these values have been calculated in hbchpt , to @xmath65 . as can be seen from tab .",
    "[ tab : s_pi_pm ] there is good agreement for @xmath52 production between our result and chpt , and both agree nicely with the experiment ( see also fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . in the case of @xmath53 production",
    "we find agreement of our result with the old let value and the result of an old experimental analysis , while chpt indicates a slightly stronger @xmath11 multipole ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : s_pi_pm ] ) .",
    "the preliminary analysis of the angular distribution in a recent experiment from triumf ( experiment e643 ) , in which the inverse reaction @xmath66 has been studied , resulted in the much larger value @xmath67 @xcite . at variance with that finding , the threshold extrapolation of the total cross sections determined from the same experiment led to @xmath68 , reasonably close to the theoretical expectations .",
    "as has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , our analysis describes the angular distribution at two energies quite well , although our solution for the @xmath11 amplitude is significantly smaller than the values according to the analysis of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we note that these threshold data were not included in our fit , and conclude that there must be some inconsistency in the data analysis , probably due to an underestimate of the statistical errors in the angular distributions .",
    "there is special theoretical interest in this amplitude because it allows for an independent determination of the difference @xmath69 of the pion - nucleon scattering lengths via the panofsky ratio , @xmath70 .",
    "this ratio is well determined by experiment , @xmath71 @xcite , and related with the scattering lengths by time reversal , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the @xmath17 momenta of photon and neutral pion at @xmath75 threshold .",
    "using @xmath76 , our value of the threshold amplitude , and the measured panofsky ratio , we find @xmath77 .",
    "this has to be compared with the value @xmath78 resulting from a partial wave analysis of pion - nucleon scattering @xcite ( solution kh80 ) .",
    "recently , @xmath79 has also been determined by studying the level spacing of pionic atoms , with a preliminary value of @xmath80 @xcite .    as has been previously mentioned ,",
    "an exact prediction of the @xmath10-wave multipoles for neutral pion production is difficult .",
    "the experimental values show a pronounced cusp effect at the @xmath81 threshold , and the expansion in @xmath8 in hbchpt seems to converge only slowly . in the framework of dispersion relations ,",
    "we observe a delicate cancelation between the large negative value of the ( pseudoscalar ) born term and the contributions of the dispersion integrals ( see line 3 of tab.[tab : e0p ] ) .",
    "our final threshold value of @xmath82 ( here and in the following in units of @xmath83 ) is obtained after iterating the integral equations , i.e. by inserting the imaginary parts of our best fit into the integrals on the @xmath84 of eqs .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) . as has been mentioned , the solutions of the best fit have been obtained by neglecting some of the weak couplings in the system of coupled equations . in general",
    ", the iterated solutions agreed with the original ones at the per cent level , thus demonstrating the validity of our approximations .",
    "the only exception to this is the @xmath11 amplitude for neutral pion production , where we obtain about @xmath85 at threshold without the iteration @xcite . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the iterated solution describes the energy dependence of the data very well , in particular the steep rise of im@xmath11 at @xmath52 threshold gives rise to the observed cusp effect .",
    "in the case of the reaction @xmath86 , we predict a similarly strong cancelation of born terms ( @xmath87 ) and resonance contributions , leading to a final result of @xmath88 ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : e0p ] ) .",
    "however , our result is considerably lower than the value of @xmath89 predicted by chpt . tab .",
    "[ tab : e0p ] also shows the influence of the roper multipole @xmath26 on the dispersion integrals . its size and",
    "even the change of sign for @xmath90 vs. @xmath91 is of great importance for our final result . as the present data for pion production from the neutron suffer considerably from systematical and statistical errors ,",
    "the predictive power of our calculation is of course much weaker in this case than for the proton .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath10-wave amplitudes , the @xmath13-waves seem to converge much faster in hbchpt @xcite . in particular , it has been possible to derive lets for the combination @xmath92 and @xmath93 of eqs .",
    "( [ p1_p3 ] ) .",
    "our results for these multipoles are compared to the predictions of chpt and experimental analyses in tab .",
    "[ tab : s_p_pi0 ] .",
    "there is general agreement , typically within @xmath94 .",
    "the most problematic case is again the multipole @xmath26 . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma][rec_pol ] ) , its influence is particularly strong in the case of polarization observables .",
    "we have demonstrated this in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] by arbitrarily reducing the strength of this multipole by @xmath95 , which changes even the sign of the beam asymmetry @xmath96 .",
    "in conclusion we find a good overall description of the existing threshold data , showing the internal consistency of the data at different energies",
    ". however , there also remain some open questions , particularly regarding the size of the multipole @xmath97- connected with the roper resonance , the phases of the photoproduction multipoles at energies above the second resonance region , and the high - energy behaviour of the amplitudes .",
    "there is also some doubt concerning the accuracy of the neutron data , and it is quite clear that the present predictions of dispersion theory can not be better than the data serving as input .",
    "the present uncertainties concerning the size of the multipole @xmath26 should be removed by the analysis of the recently measured beam asymmetry @xmath96 for neutral pion production off the proton @xcite .",
    "there is also hope that the proposed experiment @xmath98 @xcite will shed some light on the threshold amplitude for neutral pion photoproduction off the neutron",
    ". this reaction will be an extremely sensitive test of model predictions and of the size of isospin symmetry breaking in threshold pion production .",
