    "proteins provide the structural basis for living organisms and are essential research subjects of the biological sciences .",
    "although the original sequence - structure - function dogma @xcite has been seriously challenged @xcite , the protein structure , in either folded or unfolded form , still determines its function .",
    "therefore , the understanding of the structure of a protein holds the key to the prediction of the protein s function @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it remains a major challenge in the biological sciences to predict a protein s functions from its known structure .",
    "there are a few essential factors , including protein geometry , electrostatics , and flexibility , that strongly correlate to protein function .",
    "there is no need to elaborate on the importance of protein geometry and electrostatics to protein function and dynamics .",
    "however , the impact of protein flexibility to protein function is often underestimated or even overlooked . in general ,",
    "protein flexibility is the ability to deform from the equilibrium state under external forces , such as docking of ligands , docking with other proteins or random bombardments of small molecules in liquid and/or gas phases and lattice phonons in a solid phase @xcite . under physiological conditions ,",
    "proteins experience everlasting motion or structural fluctuation in a wide variety of spatiotemporal scales because of their flexibility and uninterrupted external forces .",
    "however , at absolute zero temperature , there is no protein motion or fluctuation .",
    "therefore protein motion or fluctuation is just the molecule s response to the external stimuli , while protein flexibility is an intrinsic property of the structure .",
    "in fact , protein flexibility varies from protein to protein and is a signature of the protein . in a given protein ,",
    "flexibility can be different from atom to atom , from residue to residue and from domain to domain .",
    "typically , the performance of a theoretical model for protein flexibility analysis can be validated via its prediction of protein structural fluctuation .",
    "x - ray crystallography is one of the most important techniques for protein flexibility analysis .",
    "the atomic mean - square - fluctuations are reflected in x - ray diffraction or other diffraction data and can be estimated in terms of the debye - waller factor , also known as the b - factor or temperature factor . typically , reported b - factors are not corrected for the variations in atomic diffraction cross sections and chemical stability during the diffraction data collection , which perhaps contributes to the fact that all - atom models usually do not work as well as coarse - grained models in the b - factor prediction @xcite .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is another important method , which is particularly valuable for flexibility analysis under physiological conditions .",
    "nmr is able to investigate protein flexibility at a variety of timescales .",
    "apart from experimental approaches , a number of theoretical methods have been developed for flexibility analysis and b - factor prediction in the past .",
    "protein collective motion and fluctuation can be elucidated by molecular dynamics ( md ) , which has considerably expanded our understanding of the conformational landscapes of proteins .",
    "however , the excessively large number of degrees of freedom associated with the all - atom representation and long time integration becomes computationally inefficient with increasing size of the system and can obscure larger scale motions .",
    "alternative time - independent approaches , such as normal mode analysis ( nma ) @xcite , graph theory @xcite and elastic network model ( enm ) @xcite theories , including gaussian network model ( gnm ) @xcite and anisotropic network model ( anm ) @xcite , have been developed for protein flexibility analysis in the past few decades .",
    "these methods can be derived from their corresponding newton s equations by using the time - harmonic approximation @xcite .",
    "the low order eigenmodes computed from diagonalizing the kirchhoff matrix or the hessian matrix can shed light on the long - time behavior of the protein dynamics beyond the reach of md simulations @xcite .",
    "coarse - grained based enm and gnm approaches have become popular recently due to their simplified potential and computational efficiency @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the gnm is about one order more efficient than most other approaches @xcite .",
    "improvements to these approaches have been developed for many aspects , including crystal periodicity and cofactor corrections @xcite , and density - cluster rotational - translational blocking @xcite .",
    "these approaches have been applied to the study of large proteins or protein complexes , such as , hemoglobin @xcite , f1 atpase @xcite , chaperonin groel @xcite , viral capsids @xcite , and ribosome @xcite .",
    "flexibility also plays an important role in stability @xcite and docking analysis @xcite . for further detail in their status and application ,",
    "the reader is referred to recent review papers @xcite .",
    "recently , we have developed a new multiscale formalism called continuum elasticity with atomic rigidity ( cewar ) for the elastic analysis of excessively large macromolecules . in the cewar approach",
    ", a continuous atomic rigidity function is required to characterize the shear modulus in the stress tensor of elasticity equations . to this end , a simple method , called flexibility - rigidity index ( fri ) , is introduced to evaluate macromolecular flexibility and rigidity @xcite .",
    "we noted after the publication of our earlier work @xcite that the name of `` flexibility index '' was proposed independently by von der lieth et al .",
    "@xcite and jacobs et al .",
    "@xcite for two different quantities to describe bond strengths .",
    "both of these flexibility indices are distinct from our proposed fri .",
    "the fri is a solely structural based algorithm that does not reconstruct any protein interaction hamiltonian . only elementary arithmetics is needed in the fri method for proteins .",
    "in particular , the fri prediction of protein b - factors does not require a stringently minimized structure and time consuming matrix diagonalization or matrix decomposition , nor does it involve any training procedure .",
    "two types of monotonically decaying correlation functions , namely , exponential type and lorentz type , have been utilized previously for the construction of protein correlation matrix .",
    "parameter ranges for the fri have been extensively tested and the performance of the fri for protein b - factor prediction has been carefully validated with a set of 263 proteins @xcite .",
    "it is found that for residue based b - factor prediction , the fri can be made parameter free .",
    "however , it is not clear how the fri compares to alternative approaches in the field , particularly the state of the art methods such as gnm and nma .",
    "one of the objectives of the present work is to introduce a fast fri ( ffri ) algorithm by using appropriate data structures .",
    "computational efficiency is a central issue .",
    "the computational complexity of the proposed ffri is of @xmath1 , compared to that of @xmath0 for the original fri algorithm and of @xmath5 for the gnm , where @xmath6 is the number of atoms .",
    "we use a cell lists approach @xcite to reduce the computational complexity .",
    "another objective is to introduce anisotropic fri ( afri ) algorithms for the motion analysis of biomolecules . unlike anm @xcite , which is completely global and has @xmath2 elements in its hessian matrix ,",
    "the proposed afri algorithms have adaptive hessian matrices , which vary from completely global to completely local . despite of the localization ,",
    "there are collective motions in three sets of eigenvectors .",
    "the other objective of the present work is to further analyze the performance of the fri methods for protein b - factor prediction . to this end",
    ", we examine the accuracy of fri algorithms associated with four families of correlation functions and carry out a comparative study of the fri and ffri vs. other cutting edge approaches , namely , nma and gnm . our investigation concerns three issues , i.e. , accuracy , reliability , and efficiency in the protein b - factor prediction .",
    "finally , we also demonstrate the applications of the fri and afri to protein domain analysis .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] is devoted to methods and algorithms . to establish notation and facilitate further discussion ,",
    "the fri approach is briefly discussed .",
    "we present a new simplified version of the fri that is relevant to the b - factor prediction and visualization analysis studied in this work .",
    "anisotropic fri algorithms are proposed via two different ways .",
    "the ffri algorithm is developed by using appropriate data structures to avoid the evaluation of insignificant correlation matrix elements , which leads to a sparse ffri matrix . in section",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , we first analyze the behavior of a few fri correlation functions .",
    "additionally , we examine the parameter dependence of some fri correlation functions . moreover , the performance of ffri is investigated .",
    "further , we provide a comprehensive comparison of our fri and other established methods .",
    "we adopted three protein sets corresponding to relatively small- , medium- , and large - sized structures , proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we also utilize an extended set of 365 proteins to further evaluate the performance of various methods .",
    "furthermore , the computational complexities of fri , ffri and gnm are compared over a set of 44 proteins .",
    "finally , we show that the fri offers a distinguished visualization of biomolecular structure and interaction . in section [ sec :",
    "domains ] , we demonstrate the usefulness of the fri and afri by carrying out an in - depth study of protein domains .",
    "this paper ends with concluding remarks .",
    "in the continuum elasticity with atomic rigidity ( cewar ) model , the dynamics of a biomolecular system under the given force @xmath7 is governed by the equation of motion @xcite @xmath8 + ( \\lambda + \\mu ) \\nabla \\nabla\\cdot { \\bf w }    + \\mu \\nabla^2 { \\bf w } \\right ] + { \\bf f},}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the density of the macromolecule , @xmath10 is the displacement , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively bulk modulus and shear modulus .",
    "the fri algorithm was proposed to evaluate the shear modulus , i.e. , rigidity .",
    "this section describes the theory and algorithm underpinning the fri method .",
    "we first briefly review the fri theory to establish notation .",
    "then , two anisotropic fri algorithms are introduced for the analysis of the anisotropic motions of biomolecules .",
    "finally , a fast fri algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the original fri .",
    "we consider proteins as examples to illustrate our fri algorithm , although other biomolecules , such as dna and rna , can be similarly treated with a minor modification of our algorithm .",
    "we are particularly interested in a coarse - grained representation .",
    "however , methods for a full atom description can be formulated as well .",
    "we seek a structure based algorithm to convert protein geometry into protein topology . to this end",
    ", we consider a protein with @xmath6 c@xmath13 atoms .",
    "their locations are represented by @xmath14 .",
    "we denote @xmath15 the euclidean space distance between @xmath16th c@xmath13 atom and the @xmath17th c@xmath13 atom .",
    "the distance geometry of protein c@xmath13 atoms is utilized to establish the topology connectivity by using monotonically decreasing radial basis functions , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a characteristic distance between particles , and @xmath20 is a correlation function , which is , in general , a real - valued monotonically decreasing function . as a correlation function , it satisfies @xmath21 delta sequences of the positive type discussed in an earlier work @xcite are all good choices .",
    "for example , one can use generalized exponential functions @xmath22 and generalized lorentz functions @xmath23 essentially , the correlation between any two particles should decay according to their distance .",
    "therefore , many other alternatives can be used and some of them are investigated in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "the correlation map or cross correlation is an important quantity for the gnm .",
    "we can define a similar correlation map by setting @xmath24 .",
    "the correlation map measures the connectivity of c@xmath13s in the protein . the similarity and difference of the present correlation map and that of the gnm are studied in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "we define an atomic rigidity index @xmath25 as the summation of topological connectivity @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a weight function related to the atomic type , the atomic rigidity index @xmath25 manifests the rigidity or stiffness at the @xmath16th atom . in a general sense ,",
    "the atomic rigidity index reflects the total interaction strength , including both bonded and non - bonded contributions .",
    "it is quite straightforward to define the averaged molecular rigidity index as a summation of atomic rigidity indices @xmath28 the averaged molecular rigidity index can be used to predict molecular thermal stability , bulk modulus , density ( compactness ) , boiling points of isomers , the ratio of surface area over volume , surface tension , etc .",
    "a detailed investigation of these aspects is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we are now ready to define a position dependent shear modulus @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a weight function , @xmath31 is in the proximity of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the macromolecular domain . in order to determine @xmath30 , we define an average rigidity ( or averaged rigidity index function ) by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the volume of the macromolecule .",
    "if @xmath30 is a constant , its value can be uniquely determined by a comparison of @xmath36 with experimental shear modulus @xcite for a given macromolecule and correlation function .",
    "we also define an atomic flexibility index as @xmath37 since the flexibility at each atom is proportional to its temperature fluctuation , we can express b - factors as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are theoretically predicted b - factors , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two constants to be determined by a simple linear regression .",
    "we can also define the averaged molecular flexibility index ( mfi ) as a summation of atomic flexibility indices @xmath42 mfi should correlate with molecular stability and energy .    for the purpose of visualization , we define a continuous atomic flexibility function as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a general interpolation function for scattered data .",
    "wavelets , spline functions , and modified shepard s method @xcite can be employed for the interpolation .",
    "one can map @xmath45 to the molecular surface to visualize the protein flexibility @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can compute the continuous atomic flexibility function by @xmath46      in this section , we propose a new anisotropic model based on our fri theory . in existing anisotropic methods ,",
    "the hessian matrix is always global , i.e. , the matrix contains all the @xmath47 elements for @xmath6 particles in molecule . in our afri model ,",
    "the hessian matrix is inherently local and adaptive .",
    "its size may vary from @xmath48 for a completely local afri to @xmath47 for a complete global afri , depending on the need of a physical problem .",
    "let us partition all the @xmath6 particles in a molecule into a total of @xmath49 clusters @xmath50 .",
    "cluster @xmath51 has @xmath52 particles or atoms so that @xmath53 .",
    "a cluster may be of physical interest , i.e. , an alpha helix , a domain , or a binding site of a protein .",
    "one of two extreme cases is that there is only one particle in each cluster .",
    "we therefore have @xmath6 cluster .",
    "the other case is that there is only one cluster , i.e. , the whole molecule .",
    "the essential idea is to develop a hessian matrix for each cluster individually without the information about other cluster properties ( however , information for nearby particles outside the cluster is still required ) .",
    "for example , if we are interested in the thermal fluctuation of a particular cluster @xmath51 with @xmath54 particles or atoms , we can find @xmath55 eigenvectors for the cluster .",
    "let us keep in mind that each position vector in @xmath56 has three components , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "we denote @xmath58 note that for each given @xmath59 , we define @xmath60 as a local anisotropic matrix @xmath61    since rigidity and flexibility can be both anisotropic , it is nature to propose two different afri algorithms based on rigidity hessian matrix and flexibility hessian matrix , respectively .",

    "these include relatively small- , medium- and large - sized sets of structures .",

    "both anisotropic rigidity based flexibility @xmath110 and anisotropic flexibility based flexibility ( @xmath111 ) are examined for their b - factor predictions and their average correlation coefficients are 0.602 ( @xmath90 and @xmath112 ) and 0.572 ( @xmath90 and @xmath113 ) for the superset of 365 structures .",
    "this means that afri is more accurate than gnm ( average correlation coefficient 0.565 for the superset ) . however , afri is slightly less accurate than pffri ( average correlation coefficient 0.626 for the superset ) , which is similar to the fact that anm is not as accurate as gnm .",
    "a major utility of the proposed afri theory is the prediction of protein motions by using the anisotropic flexibility .",
    "since afri is adaptive , its cluster can be as large as the whole molecule and as small as a single particle .",
    "the completely global afri has a hessian matrix of @xmath2 elements and produces @xmath114 eigenmodes .",
    "depending on symmetry , 5 or 6 modes are due to the translational and rotational motions .",
    "therefore , the remaining @xmath115 or @xmath116 vibrational modes can be obtained . to validate the proposed afri theory for normal mode analysis ,",
    "we have computed the vibrational modes for a few simple molecules , namely , h@xmath117o , co@xmath117 and ch@xmath117o , whose vibrational modes are well - known",
    ". our results are displayed in figure [ smallmolecues ] .",
    "in addition to these vibrational modes , appropriate translational and rotational modes are also observed from our calculations , but are omitted in our presentation .",
    "therefore , the proposed afri works well for the analysis of small molecular translation , rotation , and vibration .     having established our afri for small molecular vibrational analysis , we are interested in examining its behavior for macromolecules .",
    "anisotropic normal mode analysis of large biomolecules can be very expensive because the computational complexity of the global matrix scales as @xmath118 . as such , the adaptive cluster analysis option provided by the afri algorithm can be useful .",
    "in this work , we explore two extreme afri options , i.e. , the completely global cluster and completely local clusters , for protein vibrational analysis .",
    "similar to the anm , the completely global afri algorithm has a hessian matrix of @xmath2 elements and produces @xmath114 eigenmodes .",
    "the motions predicted by these eigenmodes are typically very similar to those produced by anm .",
    "in contrast , the completely localized afri has only a total of @xmath6 @xmath3 hessian matrices and gives rise to @xmath114 eigenmodes for @xmath6 particles .",
    "we assemble these @xmath114 eigenmodes into 3 modes for the molecule and weight the amplitude of each eigenmode by the corresponding b - factor for the particle . due to the non - local correlation built in the afri matrices ,",
    "these three modes of motion obtained by the completely local afri algorithm are often similar to certain low - order modes calculated by anm for a protein .",
    "the first three modes of motion for the hiv capsid protein are shown in figure [ modes ] for two afri algorithms and anm .",
    "it is seen that three eigenmodes obtained from the completely global afri resemble those calculated by the anm .",
    "although three modes produced by the completely local afri algorithm show different motions , it is amazing to note that there is much collective motion in these modes .",
    "figure [ modes2 ] depicts three modes for phosphate active transport receptor protein generated by using two afri algorithms and anm .",
    "once again , we see a good similarity between eigenmodes calculated by using the completely global afri algorithm and those computed by using the anm .",
    "however , the modes generated with the completely localized afri demonstrate somewhat different motions . in each method , the relative motion of two domains can be clearly identified .",
    "the domain relative motions in the eigenmodes of the completely global afri and the anm exhibit a better synergistic effect in general .",
    "whereas , modes from the completely local afri are slightly less collective . since there is no standard answer to domain fluctuations , it is difficult to say which one is right or wrong .",
    "an interesting observation is that although afri matrices can be completely local , they have built in non - local correlation and thus are able to simulate highly collective protein motions .",
    "the fundamental challenges that hinder the current quantitative understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity and excessively large number of degrees of freedom . a multiscale approach , the continuum elasticity with atomic rigidity ( cewar ) , provides a new method for the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom in biomolecular systems @xcite .",
    "the performance of the cewar method relies on the accurate and efficient evaluation of a continuous atomic rigidity function .",
    "the flexibility - rigidity index ( fri ) is proposed as a potential algorithm for such an evaluation .",
    "the underlying assumption of the fri is that protein interactions uniquely determine the protein structure which , in turn , determines the protein functions , such as stability and flexibility .",
    "therefore , one just needs the structural information to predict protein b - factors without reconstructing the protein interaction hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , we assume that biomolecular flexibility and rigidity are local structural properties .",
    "therefore , the flexibility at an atom is completely determined by its local environment , namely , local geometry and local topological connectivity .",
    "we treat the ( local ) flexibility as an inverse of the ( local ) rigidity . as a consequence",
    ", we do not need to solve the ( global ) eigenvalue problem of the hamiltonian .",
    "the first step of the fri method is to measure protein topological connectivity from the distance geometry via smooth and monotonically decreasing radial basis functions .",
    "the atomic rigidity index is then associated with the total connectivity or interaction strength at each residue .",
    "consequently , the atomic flexibility index , which is the inverse function of the atomic rigidity index , is associated with protein b - factors .",
    "protein flexibility is an intrinsic property that strongly correlates with protein functions .",
    "the analysis of protein flexibility is a crucial task in computational biophysics .",
    "many established methods , including normal mode analysis ( nma ) @xcite and elastic network model ( enm ) @xcite such as gaussian network model ( gnm ) @xcite , have been developed in the past .",
    "these approaches typically depend on the hamiltonian mechanics of elastic interactions and matrix decomposition of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the present work examines the performance of the proposed fri for protein flexibility analysis in a comparison with some cutting edge methods , specifically , gnm and nma .",
    "we calibrate the accuracy , reliability and computational efficiency of the fri method by using gnm and nma on three sets of proteins , i.e , relatively small - sized , medium sized and large sized structures employed by park et al .",
    "@xcite in a recent study",
    ". additional calibration with the gnm is carried out on extended set . as a result",
    ", a total of 365 proteins is studied in the present comparative study . as an internal validation , the fri method",
    "is realized by using three families of correlation functions .",
    "correlation functions of generalized exponential type and lorentz type are found to deliver better results . in particular ,",
    "correlation functions of lorentz type are simple and can be made parameter free , which is desirable for general use . although gnm and nma may outperform the proposed fri method on certain proteins in terms of the accuracy of the b - factor prediction , the fri method is able to improve on the average correlation coefficient of gnm and nma on all three sets of proteins . additionally , the fri is found to significantly outperform the gnm on the extended superset of 365 structures as well .",
    "a possible reason for the fri to outperform the existing methods is that gnm and nma are essentially global methods in a sense that they rely on the solution of the global eigenvalue problem to predict local atomic properties , e.g. , b - factors .",
    "in contrast , the fri is a local method and utilizes the local geometric information to predict local atomic properties . in parallel , there are ( global ) band theory of solids and ( local ) atomic orbital model of solids .",
    "the former is good for describing many global physical properties , such as electrical conductivity and thermal lattice motions in terms of excitations , while the latter is more powerful for explaining localized chemical reactivity and catalysis of solids .",
    "the gnm is known for its superb computational efficiency @xcite .",
    "the matrix diagonalization is of @xmath5 in computational complexity , where @xmath6 is the number of residues .",
    "the computational complexity of our original fri is of @xmath0 . in the present work ,",
    "we propose a fast fri ( ffri ) algorithm , which further reduces the computational complexity of fri to @xmath1 .",
    "both fri and ffri do not involve the time consuming matrix decomposition . as a result , it takes less than 30 seconds for the ffri to predict the b factors of an hiv virus structure with more than three hundred thousands of residues , which otherwise requires many years for the gnm to compute .",
    "additionally , both the exponential based parameter - free ffri and the lorentz based parameter - free ffri are about 10% more accurate than the gnm in the b - factor prediction of 365 proteins .",
    "anisotropic motions between protein domains are known to correlate with protein functions . to describe protein anisotropic fluctuations , we introduce anisotropic fri ( afri ) algorithms .",
    "we introduce an adaptive afri method which partitions the molecule into many clusters with variable sizes .",
    "we specifically examine two extreme cases , i.e. , a one - cluster partition and @xmath6-cluster partition , which result in a completely global @xmath2 hessian matrix and @xmath6 completely localized @xmath3 hessian matrices , respectively .",
    "the computational complexity of afri varies from @xmath5 to @xmath1 .",
    "although afri hessian matrices can be completely local , they still contain much non - location correlation .",
    "as such , all of three protein modes predicted by the completely local afri exhibit highly collective global motions .",
    "the eigenmodes obtained from the completely global afri closely resemble those of the anisotropic network model ( anm ) @xcite .",
    "however , mode constructed from the completely local afri show different collective motion patterns .",
    "since there is no analytical solution for collective motions , it is not possible to judge whose collective motions are more correct . in general , the eigenmodes of anm and the completely global afri exhibit a slightly better synergistic effect than modes generated by using the completely local afri .",
    "the proposed fri has a few visual applications .",
    "first , the correlation maps of the fri are capable of revealing both short- and long - distance interactions or connectivities .",
    "since correlation map elements are directly related to the original distances by a known radial basis function , the distances can be labeled on the map as well .",
    "additionally , the predicted b - factors can be plotted as the radii of residues to visualize the amplitude of thermal fluctuations .",
    "this plot becomes even more interesting when atomic spheres are colored with the electrostatics @xcite .",
    "the close correlation between flexibility and large electrostatic potentials can be unveiled , which sheds light on protein intrinsic structural properties .",
    "moreover , the predicted b - factors can be plotted with secondary structures to have an overall picture of structural flexibility . finally , as continuous functions , the atomic rigidity function and atomic flexibility function can be projected onto protein molecular surfaces or other surface representations to analyze flexibility .",
    "another application of fri and afri is the analysis of protein domains .",
    "existing methods , such as gnm and anm , are well known to do well for domain analysis .",
    "the present fri provides a clear correlation map for domain identifications .",
    "it is found that afri gives rise to highly collective domain motion patterns , although not all parts of a domain move uniformly in our afri representations .",

    "<S> protein structural fluctuation , typically measured by debye - waller factors , or b - factors , is a manifestation of protein flexibility , which strongly correlates to protein function . </S>",
    "<S> the flexibility - rigidity index ( fri ) is a newly proposed method for the construction of atomic rigidity functions required in the theory of continuum elasticity with atomic rigidity ( cewar ) , which is a new multiscale formalism for describing excessively large biomolecular systems . </S>",
    "<S> the fri method analyzes protein rigidity and flexibility and is capable of predicting protein b - factors without resorting to matrix diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental assumption used in the fri is that protein structures are uniquely determined by various internal and external interactions , while the protein functions , such as stability and flexibility , are solely determined by the structure . as such </S>",
    "<S> , one can predict protein flexibility without resorting to the protein interaction hamiltonian . consequently , bypassing the matrix diagonalization , the original fri has a computational complexity of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this work introduces a fast fri ( ffri ) algorithm for the flexibility analysis of large macromolecules . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed ffri further reduces the computational complexity to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we propose anisotropic fri ( afri ) algorithms for the analysis of protein collective dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the afri algorithms admit adaptive hessian matrices , from a completely global @xmath2 matrix to completely local @xmath3 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> however , these local @xmath3 matrices have built in much non - local correlation . </S>",
    "<S> eigenvectors obtained the proposed afri lagorithms are able to demonstrate collective motions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we investigate the performance of fri by employing four families of radial basis correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> both parameter optimized and parameter - free fri methods are explored . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we compare the accuracy and efficiency of fri with some established approaches to flexibility analysis , namely , normal mode analysis ( nma ) and gaussian network model ( gnm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the fri method is tested using four sets of proteins , three sets of relatively small- , medium- and large - sized structures and an extended set of 365 proteins . </S>",
    "<S> a fifth set of proteins is used to compare the efficiency of the fri , ffri , afri and gnm methods . </S>",
    "<S> intensive validation and comparison indicate that the fri , particularly the ffri , is orders of magnitude more efficient and about 10% more accurate overall than some of the most popular methods in the field . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed ffri is able to predict b - factors for @xmath4-carbons of the hiv virus capsid ( 313,236 residues ) in less than 30 seconds on a single processor using only one core . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate the application of fri and afri to protein domain analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> key words : protein flexibility , thermal fluctuation , continuum elasticity , atomic rigidity , multiscale . </S>"
