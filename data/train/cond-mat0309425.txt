    "geometrically frustrated quantum spin systems constitute a class of systems exhibiting interesting quantum phenomena like different ( unusual ) quantum phases ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews of two - dimensional models ) .",
    "an external magnetic field may further enhance this frustration since it competes with the antiparallel alignment of spins favoured by antiferromagnetic exchange .",
    "this leads to interesting quantum phenomena in the high - field magnetization process of geometrically frustrated quantum spin systems .",
    "in particular , a spin gap may be opened by the external magnetic field , giving rise to a plateau in the @xmath3 magnetization curve .",
    "although no complete review of the subject exists so far , different aspects are summarized e.g.  in @xcite . in this article",
    "we will illustrate the status of the field by pointing out and presenting selected recent and new results .",
    "specifically we consider the @xmath2 model in an external magnetic field @xmath4 @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are spin-@xmath7 operators at site @xmath8 and the @xmath9 are the exchange constants between pairs of sites @xmath10 connected in the lattice topology under consideration .",
    "the special case of ( [ hxxz ] ) where the @xmath2 anisotropy satisfies @xmath11 corresponds to the heisenberg model .",
    "below we will concentrate on the extreme quantum limit @xmath12 and antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath13 although some of the results can be generalized e.g.  to @xmath14 .",
    "an important observable is the magnetization @xmath15 which we normalize to saturation value @xmath16 ( here @xmath17 is the total number of spins in the system ) .",
    "note that the magnetization ( [ defm ] ) is a conserved quantity for the hamiltonian ( [ hxxz ] ) .",
    "this is technically useful for computing the magnetization curve e.g.  by exact diagonalization ( ed ) using the lanczos method .",
    "in one dimension , oshikawa , yamanaka and affleck proposed the following condition on the magnetization @xmath18 at a plateau in the @xmath3 magnetization curve @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath7 is the size of the local spin and @xmath20 is the number of spins in a translational unit cell of the _ ground state_. the condition ( [ condm ] ) can be understood easily starting from a limit where the system decouples into clusters with @xmath20 sites ( see e.g.@xcite ) and in this case @xmath20 is the number of spins in a unit cell of the hamiltonian . however , in particular in frustrated spin systems one finds that translational symmetry is spontaneously broken in the ground state ( c.f .",
    "examples in the following sections ) and then @xmath20 is larger than ( namely an integer multiple of ) the unit cell of the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , the quantization condition ( [ condm ] ) implies that the magnetization @xmath18 always has a rational value on a plateau .",
    "[ seczigzag ]    let us start by discussing some selected aspects of the @xmath12 frustrated heisenberg chain ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ figzigzag ] ) .",
    "majumdar and ghosh noticed more than 30 years ago @xcite that one can explicitly write down the ground state if the next - nearest neighbour coupling @xmath21 and the nearest neighbour coupling @xmath22 are related by @xmath23 .",
    "this so - called ` majumdar - ghosh ' state is a two - fold degenerate dimer product state and has become a paradigm for the frustration - induced opening of a spin gap accompanied by spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry by a period two .    in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", the spin gap leads to an @xmath24 plateau in the magnetization curve . starting with @xcite",
    ", many authors have studied the magnetization process of this model by ed ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and no plateaus with @xmath25 were found .",
    "finally , a recent density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) study of the @xmath12 frustrated heisenberg chain exhibited a clear plateau at @xmath26 in the region of strong frustration @xmath27 @xcite , as is illustrated by the main panel of fig .",
    "[ figzigzag ] which reproduces the magnetization curve for @xmath28 ( the step on the @xmath26 plateau in the dmrg curve is due to the open boundaries ) .",
    "the state of this @xmath26 plateau spontaneously breaks translational symmetry by a period _ three_. two points are worthwhile noticing here .",
    "first , this period three is higher than the period two appearing in the majumdar - ghosh state @xcite at @xmath29 .",
    "second , the very presence of this plateau was missed for a long time .",
    "with hindsight , this @xmath26 plateau can be observed also in the ed results for @xmath30 and @xmath31 sites and periodic boundary conditions ( reproduced for @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ figzigzag ] after @xcite  this figure also includes a new @xmath32 curve ) .",
    "it may be instructive to consider the reasons for missing it nevertheless .",
    "first , the excited states at @xmath29 @xcite and correspondingly the ground states in a magnetic field @xmath33 have in general incommensurate momenta @xcite which leads to oscillating finite - size effects .",
    "second , one should concentrate on system sizes that can accommodate the known antiferromagnetic ground states in the limit of two decoupled chains @xmath34 , implying that @xmath35 should be a multiple of 4 . in addition",
    ", only those values of the magnetization can be studied which are realized for a given system size .",
    "in particular , @xmath26 is realized only if @xmath35 is a multiple of 3 .",
    "these considerations restrict the system sizes that should be used for the discussion of an @xmath26 plateau in the frustrated heisenberg chain to multiples of 12 .",
    "the first cases are @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "these are used in fig .",
    "[ figzigzag ] and are in good agreement with the dmrg results of @xcite .",
    "now we wish to draw the reader s attention to the @xmath12 orthogonal dimer chain ( also known as dimer - plaquette chain ) @xcite shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figorthdim ] , a further one - dimensional model where some remarkable properties were missed originally .",
    "this model attracted renewed attention recently since it can be regarded as a one - dimensional version of the two - dimensional shastry - sutherland model @xcite .    a first study @xcite of the magnetization process of the @xmath12 orthogonal dimer chain found plateaus with @xmath37 and @xmath1",
    "however , this study missed further plateaus and thus the remarkable property of the orthogonal dimer chain that it gives rise to a magnetization curve with ( probably infinitely ) many plateaus for some values of the parameters @xcite .",
    "at least some steps in the derivation can be carried out exactly exploiting the special property of the orthogonal dimer chain that the total spin on each vertical dimer is conserved .",
    "a plateau - state can then be characterized as follows @xcite : @xmath38 consecutive vertical dimers form triplets ( @xmath39 ) , separated by singlets ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "covering the chain periodically with such ` fragments ' of length @xmath38 each in the sector @xmath41 yields @xmath42 at @xmath43 and for @xmath44 only precisely these states consisting of fragments of length @xmath38 with @xmath41 appear as ground states in a magnetic field @xcite , whereas for @xmath45 the ground state is in a sector where all vertical dimers form triplets @xmath46 ( one difference between the present fig .",
    "[ figorthdim ] and the original fig .",
    "3 of @xcite is in the system sizes that have been used for extrapolating the magnetization curve in the region @xmath47 ) .",
    "as long as @xmath44 , fragments of increasing length become ground states with increasing field , leading to a magnetization curve with infinitely many plateaus at the magnetization values given by ( [ mfrag ] ) and jumps in between , compare the main panel of fig .",
    "[ figorthdim ] .",
    "this infinite series accumulates at @xmath48 , where one finds a further pronounced plateau before a smooth transition to saturation follows .",
    "the infinite sequence of plateaus arises in the orthogonal dimer chain because the ground states manifestly break translational symmetry with arbitrarily long periodicity @xmath49 , implying that at least in one dimension there is no general upper bound on the possible periods for spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry .",
    "to the best of our knowledge there are no rigorous arguments why the condition ( [ condm ] ) should hold in dimensions higher than one . furthermore",
    ", starting from two dimensions one may have true long - range order in the spin components at @xmath3 .",
    "accordingly , an external magnetic field can induce transitions between different ordered and disordered states .    in one dimension ,",
    "a plateau at a given @xmath18 already requires a detailed analysis of the specific model . and ,",
    "even more so the presence and nature of a plateau state must be discussed case by case in two dimensions .",
    "some selected examples are presented in the following sections .",
    "let us start with a brief discussion of the magnetization process of the square lattice which is a non - frustrated model and well understood .",
    "[ figsquare ] shows the magnetization curve of the @xmath12 square - lattice heisenberg model ( @xmath11 ) obtained by different approaches .",
    "first , the thin full line shows the result obtained by ed for a finite lattice with @xmath0 sites ( see also @xcite for earlier ed studies  in the particular case @xmath0 , the largest dimension to be treated was 554 596 326 and occurred in the sector @xmath50 ) .",
    "the full bold line denotes an extrapolation of the ed data to the thermodynamic limit which is obtained by connecting the midpoints of the finite - size steps at the largest available system size .",
    "one observes a smooth magnetization curve with no peculiar features ( in particular no plateaus ) for @xmath51 .",
    "note that close to saturation the extrapolated curve includes data at large system sizes , which is not shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ figsquare ] .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath52 , the curve is based exclusively on finite lattices with at least @xmath53 sites .",
    "the high - field part of the magnetization curve is therefore particularly well controlled by ed .",
    "second , a second - order spinwave result @xcite is also available and shown by the bold dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figsquare ] .",
    "third , the magnetization process of the square lattice can also be studied by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) since this lattice is not frustrated .",
    "the diamonds in fig .",
    "[ figsquare ] show available stochastic - series - expansion qmc results @xcite .",
    "the quantitive differences of the results of all three approaches are small , i.e.  each approach yields a good description of the @xmath12 square lattice .",
    "since the spinwave approach @xcite is based on a nel state , we may therefore conclude that nel order prevails in the transverse components for @xmath51 ( see also @xcite for a discussion from the point of view of ed ) .",
    "the @xmath12 @xmath2 model on the triangular lattice is among the first models whose magnetization process was studied by ed @xcite .",
    "these early studies already found a plateau with @xmath26 , at least for ising - like anisotropies @xmath54 . due to the restriction to at most 21 sites , it was first not completely clear whether the plateau persists in the isotropic regime @xmath55 .",
    "the magnetization process of the isotropic model was analyzed further using spinwave theory @xcite .",
    "this study provided evidence that the @xmath26 plateau exists also at @xmath11 and estimates for its boundaries were obtained .",
    "[ figtriag ] shows the magnetization curves obtained by ed for @xmath11 on finite lattices with @xmath56 and @xmath36 sites ( thin lines ) . both curves exhibit a clear plateau at @xmath26 in an otherwise smooth magnetization curve",
    "these two curves overlap with previous ed results @xcite .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath57 only the sector @xmath58 was studied previously for @xmath59 @xcite , but it turns out that the ground state is not always in this sector .",
    "inclusion of sectors with @xmath60 for @xmath57 , a different shape of the @xmath56 system and a previously incomplete @xmath57 curve lead to small differences of our fig .  [ figtriag ] as compared to fig .  4 of @xcite . the first - order spinwave results for the magnetic fields at the lower and the upper boundaries of the @xmath26 plateau @xcite are smaller by about @xmath61 ( lower boundary ) and @xmath62 ( upper boundary ) than the ed results presented here for @xmath57 and @xmath12 .",
    "the full bold line in fig .  [ figtriag ] denotes an extrapolation of the ed data to the thermodynamic limit which is obtained by connecting the midpoints of the finite - size steps at the largest available system size ( except for the boundaries of the @xmath26 plateau where corners were used ) .",
    "close to saturation",
    "this includes again bigger system sizes than those explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ figtriag ] .",
    "the state of the @xmath26 plateau can be easily understood in the ising limit @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations are completely suppressed in the limit @xmath64 and the @xmath26 state is a classical state where all spins on two of the three sublattices of the triangular lattice point up and all spins on the third sublattice point down , as is sketched in the inset of fig .  [ figtrov ] .",
    "this state corresponds to an ordered collinear spin configuration .",
    "it breaks translational symmetry by a period three and accordingly is threefold degenerate .",
    "one can then use perturbation theory in @xmath65 to study the @xmath26 plateau of the @xmath2 model @xcite . here",
    "we numerically compute the overlap of the appropriate linear combination @xmath66 of the three ising states and the @xmath26 wave function @xmath67 of the full @xmath2 model with @xmath12 in order to show that this description remains qualitatively valid even in the isotropic region @xmath55 .",
    "[ figtrov ] shows results for the overlap @xmath68 on finite lattices with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath36 sites ( for @xmath57 we have computed the overlaps by considering only the wave function within the @xmath71-subspace that contains the ground state for @xmath72 ) .",
    "one observes that this overlap remains large even in the vicinity of the heisenberg model @xmath11 and drops sharply around @xmath73 .",
    "accordingly , this @xmath26 plateau state is a stable phase for @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "remarkably , this estimate for @xmath76 is close to the estimate @xmath77 for the vanishing point of the @xmath26 plateau which was obtained in @xcite by comparing the plateau widths on @xmath78 and @xmath79 systems .",
    "note that the location of the sharp drop in fig .",
    "[ figtrov ] is almost independent of system size although the absolute values of the overlaps @xmath68 do depend on @xmath17 .",
    "we can thus locate the point @xmath76 where the @xmath26 plateau disappears quite accurately at @xmath80 .      finally , fig .",
    "[ figkag ] shows magnetization curves for the kagom lattice ( see inset ) with @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath36 sites .",
    "note that the @xmath57 curve in fig .",
    "[ figkag ] differs slightly from the corresponding curve in @xcite for @xmath59 .",
    "the reason is that due to the computational effort only selected @xmath71-sectors were investigated in @xcite and in some cases the correct symmetry of the ground state was in fact missed .",
    "our new @xmath57 curve agrees with unpublished results of waldtmann and everts @xcite .",
    "the kagom lattice is famous for a disordered ground state at @xmath29 accompanied by a small spin gap with many singlets inside this gap ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". the spin gap should give rise to a narrow @xmath24 plateau even if it is difficult to recognize in fig .",
    "[ figkag ] .",
    "a plateau at @xmath26 can be recognized better in fig .",
    "[ figkag ] .",
    "in fact , the presence of this plateau at @xmath26 in the @xmath12 heisenberg model on the kagom lattice has been established previously by considering also system sizes different from those shown in fig .",
    "[ figkag ] @xcite . nevertheless , the state of this plateau is still an interesting issue . for the classical heisenberg model at @xmath26 ,",
    "thermal fluctuations select collinear states , but due to the huge degeneracy of this space , there appears to be no real order on the classical level at @xmath26 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for @xmath12 , it is useful to consider the @xmath2 model . in the ising limit",
    "@xmath64 one can then first establish @xcite a relation to a quantum dimer model on the hexagonal lattice which was argued @xcite to give rise to a valence bond crystal ground state with a @xmath81 order indicated by the circles in the hexagons in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figkag ] . furthermore ,",
    "like for the triangular lattice one can compute the overlap ( see fig .",
    "[ figtrov ] ) of the @xmath26 wave function of the @xmath2 model with that of the quantum dimer model as a function of @xmath82 and one finds no evidence for a phase transition for @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this implies that also the @xmath26 state of the @xmath12 heisenberg model on the kagom lattice is a three - fold degenerate valence bond crystal , i.e.  an ordered state with many low - lying non - magnetic excitations , but still a small gap to _ all _ excitations @xcite",
    ".    there may be a further plateau at @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ figkag ] although it is difficult to draw unambiguous conclusions from the available numerical data in this region of magnetization values .",
    "finally , one can see a pronounced jump of height @xmath84 just below saturation in fig .",
    "[ figkag ] .",
    "this jump arises due to local magnon excitations which can be constructed in the spin-@xmath7 @xmath2 model on the kagom lattice @xcite .",
    "these local magnon excitations give rise to an exact degeneracy at the saturation field and thus a macroscopic jump in the magnetization curve of height @xmath85 . in the state just below the jump , magnons are localized on the hexagons marked by circles in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figkag ] .",
    "since this is a crystalline ordered state , general arguments ( see e.g.  @xcite ) predict a gap and consequently a plateau in the magnetization curve at @xmath86 .",
    "indeed , a plateau at @xmath87 can be seen clearly in the magnetization curve of the @xmath12 heisenberg model on the kagom lattice in particular when one considers also lattices with @xmath88 and @xmath89 sites @xcite .",
    "in this article we have discussed examples of plateaus in one- and two - dimensional quantum spin models . in one dimension , the appearance of a plateau is controlled by the quantization condition ( [ condm ] ) which implies in particular that the magnetization @xmath18 on a plateau must be rational .",
    "this condition can be interpreted as a commensurability condition for the ground state .",
    "hence , it is important to observe that translational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in frustrated quantum spin models . even in well - studied examples such as the frustrated @xmath12 heisenberg chain ,",
    "an @xmath90 plateau with a spontaneously broken period three was discovered only recently @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an infinite sequence of plateaus in the orthogonal dimer chain @xcite shows that there is no upper bound on the possible periodicity of spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry .",
    "it is less clear if the condition ( [ condm ] ) is also applicable to two and higher dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , it works for most examples discussed here : the state of the @xmath26 plateau in the @xmath12 triangular lattice has a unit cell with @xmath91 spins ( see section [ sectriag ] ) and for the kagom lattice the plateaus with @xmath26 in the @xmath12 model as well as the one with @xmath86 in the spin-@xmath7 model both have unit cells with @xmath92 spins ( see section [ seckag ] , in particular the inset of fig .",
    "[ figkag ] ) .",
    "these cases fit well with the quantization condition ( [ condm ] ) .",
    "however , the disordered ground state at @xmath29 in the @xmath12 kagom lattice ( see @xcite and references therein ) is not covered by the condition ( [ condm ] ) since it gives rise to an @xmath24 plateau without the appropriate breaking of translational symmetry .    from the point of view of experiments",
    ", the exchange constants @xmath9 dictate the scale of magnetic fields needed to access the high - field region .",
    "srcu@xmath93(bo@xmath94)@xmath93 is an @xmath12 system with sufficiently small @xmath95 s that permit the observation of plateaus at @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 in pulsed - field magnetization experiments @xcite .",
    "srcu@xmath93(bo@xmath94)@xmath93 is believed to be a good realization of the two - dimensional shastry - sutherland lattice @xcite .",
    "because of its relation to srcu@xmath93(bo@xmath94)@xmath93 , this frustrated spin model has been analyzed theoretically in detail ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
