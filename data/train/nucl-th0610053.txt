    "in the works of becher and leutwyler @xcite it was shown that the convergence of the chiral expansion of the nucleon scalar form factor , driven by the triangle diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , is a delicate issue for values of the momentum transfer @xmath0 near @xmath1 due to the presence of an anomalous threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ a branch point in the second riemann sheet right below the two - pion threshold .",
    "such a singularity is completely neglected in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath2pt ) , and can only be recovered by resumming the heavy baryon series to all orders . in order to understand this problem one can start from the spectral representation of the triangle integral ,    @xmath3        formally , the argument @xmath4 is counted as order @xmath5 and the hb expansion yields @xmath6 , but this is valid only in the domain @xmath7 .",
    "the first two terms reproduce the hb result for the triangle graph ,    @xmath8 \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] & = & \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2m_{n}m_{\\pi}}\\left[2\\pi m_{\\pi}\\,a(q)+ \\frac{m_{\\pi}}{m_{n}}\\ , \\frac{(2m_{\\pi}^2+q^2)}{(4m_{\\pi}^2+q^2)}\\,l(q)\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : new03}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the usual hb loop functions ,    @xmath12    however , it does not take into consideration the case @xmath13 , where @xmath14 gets closer to @xmath15 .",
    "this region determines the long distance behavior of the triangle diagram , as can be seen by its representation in configuration space  @xcite ,    @xmath16    clearly one sees that , in order to have a good asymptotic description of @xmath17 , one needs a decent representation for @xmath18 near @xmath19 , which can not be provided by hb@xmath2pt .",
    "we want to stress that the expansion in @xmath20 of our two - pion exchange nucleon - nucleon potential ( tpep ) should , in principle , recover the expressions from hb@xmath2pt , and we used this fact as a cross - checking of our calculation ( see next section ) . however one must keep in mind that , due to the problem described above , such an expansion should not be done .",
    "the technical details in the evaluation of our tpep is described in refs .",
    "our loop integrals are calculated relativistically using dimensional regularization in the @xmath21 scheme , and we showed that they become almost identical as the infrared - regularized results in configuration space for distances above 1fm  @xcite . because we are constructing the kernel of the interaction in a relativistic way one has to deal with the subtraction of the iterated one - pion exchange , with the intermediate two - nucleon propagating only with positive energy .",
    "the subtraction of this contribution is not unique , and in @xcite we adopted the blankenbecler - sugar prescription .",
    "the @xmath22 expansion of our tpep and comparison with the hb results were shown in @xcite , where we initially found 14 different terms out of lengthy expressions , which will not be reproduced here .",
    "we revised our calculations , in particular the two loop contributions  @xcite , and with the corrected expressions these differences dropped down to 9 terms .",
    "their origins are now better understood : six of them come from the prescription for the subtraction of the iterated one - pion exchange , and using the same procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see  @xcite ) those differences went away .",
    "the remaining three come from two loop diagrams , and the reason for such a discrepancy is harder to access .",
    "it is quite possible that they come from the way the one - loop counterterms in the @xmath23n amplitude were renormalized @xcite .",
    "numerically they are not significant  @xcite , but if one aims at increasing precision this technical issue may have to be revisited .",
    "from now on we will ignore these differences and focus only on the effect of the @xmath22 expansion . to regularize the short - distance divergence one considers a phenomenological cutoff of the argonne v14-v18 type ,    @xmath24 ^ 4\\ , , \\label{eq : cutoff}\\ ] ]    with @xmath25 , and in the remaining of this section one adopts the @xmath23n lecs from entem and machleidt  @xcite ( to be discussed in the next section ) .",
    "the nn potential is further supplemented with the usual charge - dependent one - pion exchange .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] show the ratios of the @xmath20 expanded ( hb ) over the non - expanded ( rb ) tpe potentials for @xmath26 and @xmath27 partial waves and they represent , respectively , what one observes for the total isospin @xmath28 and @xmath29 channels . for @xmath28 waves the ratio follows the behavior of the loop integrals @xcite , with differences of @xmath30 20% at @xmath31fm and increasing with the distance . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath29 case shows a sizeable factor of 1.7 already at @xmath32fm .",
    "a numerical investigation suggests that a significant cancellation happens between the isoscalar and isovector components in this region  @xcite , therefore amplifying the difference between the hb and rb results .",

    "the important observation to be made is the large spread in the central value of these constants , usually extracted from @xmath23n scattering with large uncertainties , and the question to ask is whether peripheral nn scattering is able to restrict some of these sets of lecs .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] , the difference between hb and rb predictions for phase shifts is quite small , except for values of lecs from fettes _ et.al . _ and moji , which are not consistent with nijmegen s partial wave analysis  @xcite ( pwa ) anyway .",
    "the reason is that the potentials differ significantly after @xmath38fm , where the tpep is already too small and gets washed away by the opep .    concerning the lecs ,",
    "our results show more sensitivity to the constant @xmath35 , which controls the strength of the attractive , central scalar - isoscalar potential .",
    "it can be inferred from the values of fettes _ et.al . _ and moji ( and a bit less from nijmegen ) , which have larger values for @xmath39 and produces larger , positive contributions to the phase shifts .",
    "we also varied the cutoff parameter @xmath40 in eq .",
    "[ eq : cutoff ] between 1.5 and 2.5 @xmath41 and observed very small variations and good overall agreement with pwa using the lecs from entem and machleidt , and slightly bigger variations and disagreement in some waves for values from bttiker and meiner . in the case of nijmegen , agreement with pwa is possible in some waves only with a cutoff as low as 1.0@xmath41 , and keeping this as a lower limit for @xmath40 , no agreement with pwa is reached for lecs from fettes _ et.al . _ or from moji .",
    "this indicates that peripheral nucleon - nucleon scattering favors smaller absolute values for the lec @xmath35 .",
    "a question that arises is why the lecs extracted by the nijmegen group , from the nucleon - nucleon scattering data , does not seem to be compatible with their own pwa .",
    "part of the answer comes from the fact that in refs .",
    "@xcite the expressions for the @xmath42 nn potential were used , while in the nijmegen work , the @xmath43 nn potential was employed .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] , where in the dashed , light curve the nijmegen values for the lecs were used on the @xmath43 expressions for the nn potential .",
    "another possible contribution to this discrepancy could be the fact that we are solving the usual schrdinger equation , while the nijmegen group employs the relativistic schrdinger equation in their analysis .",
