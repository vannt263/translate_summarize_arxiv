    "in the recent past many efforts have been made to calculate two - loop feynman diagrams with masses , e.g. @xcite .",
    "though now very effective methods exist for the general mass case of the two - loop two point function @xcite , these methods need considerable extensions or modifications to cope with two - loop three - point functions in general .",
    "the planar topology has been discussed extensively , e.g.  in @xcite . for the other important topology",
    " the crossed topology  so far two methods have been presented .    the method presented in @xcite",
    "is based on feynman parameters and uses high dimensional monte carlo integration , resulting in extensive cpu usage and slow convergence when high accuracy is needed .",
    "taylor expansion , analytic continuation and pad approximations , as presented in @xcite , gives results with very high accuracy , but the method is , at this stage , still restricted to one kinematical variable .",
    "our approach is based on @xcite , where it gave excellent results for the planar two - loop three point function .",
    "the calculation of the crossed topology is similar to the planar case .",
    "again we succeed by considering orthogonal and parallel space variables . from this starting point ,",
    "a four - fold integration is immediately obtained . still following the lines of @xcite we use euler transformations for subsequent integrations .",
    "the difference between the planar and the non - planar topology is apparent in the increasing number of different cases which have to be considered for the latter , while , fortunately , the conceptual frame remains unaffected .",
    "once more we end up with a two - fold integral over a finite region , solely involving dilogarithms and related functions .",
    "this integral representation allows for a gaussian quadrature , and is thus perfectly suitable for practical purposes @xcite .",
    "our task is to calculate the two - loop crossed vertex function , as shown in fig.[fig : crossedfig ] .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the scalar integral , which is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the momentum of the incoming particle and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the momenta of the outgoing particles .",
    "further , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the internal loop momenta , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the propagators of the internal particles , as labeled in fig.[fig : crossedfig ] .",
    "we assume that all external particles are massive and have time - like momenta .",
    "the massless limit is approached smoothly as long as no on - shell singularities occur .",
    "the integral will be splitted into parallel and orthogonal space integrations .",
    "the parallel space is two - dimensional here , hence leaving two dimensions for the orthogonal space .",
    "the integral is convergent in @xmath8 dimensions , and there is no need to use a regularization scheme .",
    "since the integral is lorentz invariant , the splitting into parallel and orthogonal space variables is equivalent to the choice of a lorentz frame . for time - like external particles",
    ", we choose the rest frame of the incoming particle , and assume that outgoing particles are moving along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "explicitly , the four - momenta are chosen as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 positive and @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the propagators @xmath6 of the internal particles can be written down using the flow of loop momenta as shown in fig.[fig : crossedfig ] @xmath16 a small imaginary part @xmath17 with @xmath18 is assigned to the squared masses of the internal particles and is chosen equal for all particles for convenience . hence differences of propagators have a vanishing imaginary part , which we utilize in the following .",
    "the choice of different ( small , positive ) @xmath19 s for the propagator would not change our final result , but is technically more cumbersome .    using the explicit representation of the momenta in eq.([eq : momenta ] ) , a shift of the loop momenta with a trivial jacobian according to @xmath20 achieves that the propagators are linear in @xmath21 and @xmath22 and hence can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    the volume element in the integral in eq.([eq : theintegral ] )",
    "is given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the angle @xmath30 describing the absolute position of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the integration over @xmath30 gives a trivial factor @xmath31 .",
    "an important difference between the crossed and the planar two - loop vertex function is that now necessarily two ( instead of one ) propagators depend on @xmath24 , which , in our notation , are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that in the planar case the loop momenta can be arranged to flow through only one common propagator , which is not possible for the crossed topology .",
    "but after applying a partial fraction decomposition to the integrand @xmath34 the @xmath24-dependence in @xmath35 drops out and the @xmath24-integration can be performed as in the planar case : @xmath36{a_k^2-b_k^2 + 2 a_k",
    "i\\eta } } , \\quad k=1,2\\ ] ] where @xmath37 for the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parfrac1 ] ) and @xmath38 in the second , respectively .",
    "@xmath39{z}$ ] denotes the square root of a complex number with a cut along the positive real axis , whereas @xmath40 is the usual square root of a positive real number ( if @xmath9 has a small imaginary part of any sign , it can be ignored ) .",
    "the next step is the integration over @xmath21 and @xmath22 using cauchy s theorem for both of them .",
    "it is important to notice that , as a result of the partial fraction decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parfrac1 ] ) , in the difference @xmath35 the imaginary part of the masses @xmath17 , which has been chosen to be equal for all masses , drops out .",
    "therefore not all poles in @xmath21 and @xmath22 lie in the upper or lower complex half - plane , but some also on the real axis .",
    "the integral can be made meaningful if interpreted as a principal value integral .",
    "for the propagators , as mentioned earlier . after having convinced ourselves that the results remain unchanged , we prefer to follow the route outlined here , for purely technical reasons . ]",
    "then one has to use the modified cauchy s theorem @xcite : @xmath41                                               \\mbox{\\tiny $ > $ } \\end{array}\\!\\!}0}\\nonumber\\\\    & &   + i \\pi \\sum_j^m { \\mbox{res}}(f(z ) ) \\bigg|_{z = z_j , \\,\\mbox{\\scriptsize im}(z_j)=0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath42 are the @xmath43 poles of @xmath44 inside the closed integration contour , whereas @xmath45 are @xmath46 poles along the integration path .",
    "poles on the path contribute only with half the weight compared to poles inside the path .",
    "for the cases we are confronted with it is guaranteed that the function tends to zero sufficiently fast for large @xmath21 and @xmath22 , hence the theorem is applicable .",
    "the integration path has to be closed either in the upper or in the lower complex half - plane , depending on the position of the cuts of the square root @xmath39{a^2-b^2 + 2 a i\\eta}$ ] .",
    "similarly to the planar case , the position of the cuts is determined by the sign of @xmath47 for the first term in eq.([eq : parfrac1 ] ) and by the sign of @xmath48 for the second term .",
    "let us concentrate on the first term of the partial fraction decomposition , the second can be handled analogously .",
    "assume @xmath49 , so that we have to close the contour of the @xmath21 integration in the lower half - plane .",
    "then , some propagators have poles inside the path : @xmath50 iff @xmath51 and @xmath52 iff @xmath53 .",
    "additionally , @xmath54 always contributes with half its residue , since it has a pole on the real axis . in the following",
    "we will call residues , which involve only @xmath55 , _ complex _ contributions , because all poles lie in the upper or lower complex half - plane , whereas residues involving @xmath35 are called _ real _ contributions , because the pole lies on the real axis .    for the @xmath22 integration",
    ", we close the contour in the same half - plane as for the @xmath21 integration , depending on the sign of @xmath47 .",
    "this is not necessary for the @xmath54 contribution , where the square root becomes independent of @xmath22 , but it is done for consistency .",
    "let us first assume that we had a @xmath21-pole in @xmath50 .",
    "then we have poles in @xmath22 from @xmath56 iff @xmath57 and @xmath58 iff @xmath59 , and a pole in @xmath54 , iff @xmath60 .",
    "but the last case is a contradiction to @xmath51 above , so it does not contribute .",
    "analogously , if we had a @xmath21-pole in @xmath52 , we have the same constraints from @xmath56 and @xmath58 , but @xmath61 from @xmath54 , which is again a contradiction .    the last case , a @xmath21-pole in @xmath54 , gives contributions from all other propagators , namely @xmath50 iff @xmath60 , @xmath56 iff @xmath57 , @xmath52 iff @xmath61 and @xmath58 iff @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath62 , the relation operators have to be reversed in all inequalities .",
    "out of the _ complex _ combinations , only the pairs @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 contribute in triangular regions in the @xmath66 plane if @xmath49 ( see fig.[fig : complcontr1 ] ) . if @xmath62 , no terms contribute .",
    "all _ real _ residues contribute for @xmath49 as well as for @xmath62 .",
    "the areas are not triangles , but unbound , as can be seen in fig.[fig : realcontr1 ] .",
    "the second term of the partial fraction decomposition also gives us three contributing _ complex _ residues ( all for @xmath67 , fig.[fig : complcontr2 ] ) and four _ real _ residues , which have the same constraints as for the first term , but with @xmath68 > \\end{array}}0 $ ] replaced by @xmath69 > \\end{array}}0 $ ] ( fig.[fig : realcontr2 ] ) .",
    "if we compare the _ real _ contributions from both terms of the partial fraction decomposition eq.([eq : parfrac1 ] ) , we notice that the terms for two corresponding residues ( e.g. @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) are equal , except for an overall minus sign . as a consequence they cancel in the area where both contribute together .",
    "this is everywhere the case except in the strip @xmath72 ( see fig.[fig : realcontr3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore it can be shown that all four _ real _ contributions from fig.[fig : realcontr3 ] add up to zero where they all contribute together .",
    "this is the case everywhere outside the finite area shown in fig.[fig : realcontr4 ] , which is also the joined area of all triangles in figs.[fig : complcontr1 ] and [ fig : complcontr2 ] from the _ complex _ residues .    after the residue integrations we end up with a four - fold integral representation which is similar in nature , but slightly more complicated in its technical appearance than the planar case .",
    "it can be written in the general form @xmath73{(a t+b+c s)^2 - 4 s t } } { \\ , .}\\label{eq:4fold}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath74-sum runs over all areas @xmath75 depicted in figs.[fig : complcontr1 ]  [ fig : realcontr2 ] .",
    "the coefficients @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are in general dependent on @xmath74 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath82 have an infinitesimal imaginary part , all other coefficients are real .",
    "some coefficients are vanishing : for the _ complex _ residues , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are zero , and we have one pure pole in @xmath88 , one in @xmath89 and a mixed @xmath90 pole .",
    "for the _ real _ residues , either @xmath91 or @xmath92 , i.e. we have two mixed poles and either one pure pole in @xmath89 or in @xmath88 .",
    "in the latter case we can relabel @xmath93 , together with exchanging @xmath94 and @xmath95 , so that we always have exactly two poles in @xmath88 , either pure or mixed , and @xmath96 . in the planar case we always had one pure @xmath88 pole and two pure @xmath89 poles , with mixed poles altogether absent .    to proceed further with the @xmath88 and @xmath89 integrations",
    ", we apply a partial fraction decomposition in @xmath88 , followed by a similar partial fraction decomposition in @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath97 with @xmath98 thus we have to calculate four integrals of the form",
    "@xmath99{(a t+b+c s)^2 - 4st}}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 being either a linear function of @xmath89 or a constant .",
    "now we have to split these into real and imaginary part .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath82 always has a positive small imaginary part , whereas the sign of the imaginary part of @xmath101 and @xmath102 is a function of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , so that in general @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "in contrast , in the planar case the imaginary part was always negative .",
    "now there are three possible sources for an imaginary part of @xmath105 : either @xmath106 , @xmath107 or the argument of the square root can become negative . in the first two cases the imaginary part can be extracted using @xmath108 to analyze the contribution from the square root , we have to distinguish between _ complex _ and _ real _ residues .",
    "for the _ complex _ case , the area in the @xmath109 plane , where the argument is negative , is an ellipse . for a given positive @xmath89 ,",
    "the @xmath88 values on the border of the ellipse can be calculated as @xmath110 ^2 { \\ , , } \\ ] ] which has real and positive solutions for @xmath111 if @xmath112 , since @xmath113 , cf .",
    "[ fig : ellipse ] . for the _ real _ residues ,",
    "@xmath114 and @xmath115 , therefore the area where the argument becomes negative is unbounded with a parabola as its boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : parabel ] ) .",
    "now we can do the @xmath88-integration with the aid of an euler s change of variables @xcite and obtain @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 where we note that @xmath106 and @xmath119 are functions of @xmath89 and further @xmath120 and @xmath121 or 2 , depending on the relative magnitudes of @xmath106 and @xmath122 and the sign of the imaginary part of @xmath106 .",
    "one has to choose @xmath123 in eqs.([eq : sint1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sint2 ] ) if @xmath124 , and @xmath125 else .",
    "the condition @xmath126 is equivalent to @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath89-intervals where @xmath5 is constant , together with the corresponding @xmath5 values , can be calculated by solving @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath89 . with another euler",
    "s change of variables , using eq.([eq : pvplusipidelta ] ) and exploiting the relevant properties of the functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 , the @xmath89-integration leads to expressions of the form @xmath132 @xmath133 and @xmath134 which can be expressed in terms of logarithms , arcus - tangens , dilogarithms and clausen s functions @xcite , as it was the case for the planar topology .",
    "the full result is , as expected , a lengthy expression in terms of these special functions , which we can not list here .",
    "we rather follow the philosophy of @xcite and present examples in the next section .",
    "we stress that to obtain stable numerical results in the two dimensional integral over @xmath84 and @xmath85 it is very important to add all contributions ( _ real _ and _ complex _ ) to the same @xmath84 and @xmath85 , because eq.([eq : parfrac1 ] ) introduces some artificial divergences which cancel in the sum .",
    "as expected , the numerical integrand for the crossed topology is of the same nature as for the planar case , but involves more terms and different cases .",
    "this naturally increases the amount of cpu time needed to obtain the requested accuracy : as a thumb rule , we found that the crossed topology demands 5 - 10 times more time compared to the planar case .",
    "the threshold behaviour can be examined with the four - fold integral representation eq.([eq:4fold ] ) .",
    "the crossed vertex function has three two - particle thresholds and six three - particle thresholds .",
    "as stated above a possible source for an imaginary part is a negative argument of the square root .",
    "a necessary condition for this to happen is @xmath112 for some @xmath84 , @xmath85 inside the integration region .",
    "it can be shown that each three - particle threshold corresponds to one of the six @xmath82 coefficients of the _ complex _ triangles @xcite .",
    "the other @xmath82 coefficients belonging to the _ real _ regions are identical and correspond to the two - particle threshold @xmath135 .",
    "the remaining two - particle thresholds @xmath136 and @xmath137 can be identified with the coefficients @xmath138 ( when @xmath139 ) and @xmath140 respectively which produce an imaginary part when @xmath138 and @xmath140 become negative .",
    "a possible four - particle threshold @xmath141 disconnects the graph into three parts and is therefore a combination of the two two - particle thresholds @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "only few analytical and/or numerical results are known for the crossed vertex function to compare with . besides the symmetries with respect to internal masses and external momenta , some limiting cases can be checked . in the case of zero momentum transfer",
    "the crossed vertex function reduces to the master two - point topology @xcite with a squared propagator .",
    "fig.[fig : exmaster ] shows these limits for some arbitrary masses ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) , @xmath148 and either @xmath149 or @xmath150 .",
    "additionally , for vanishing @xmath151 we obtain the vacuum bubble calculated in @xcite .    for the case of all internal masses vanishing an analytical formula in known @xcite .",
    "this limit is approached smoothly in fig.[fig : zeromass ] for all masses going to zero simultaneously and @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .    in the limit of the momenta of the outgoing particles on the light - cone ( @xmath155 ) and all internal masses equal this diagram",
    "can be calculated with the small momentum expansion technique @xcite .",
    "a comparison for real and imaginary part is show in fig.[fig : tarasov ] .    we can obtain this limit easily by transforming our parallel space coordinates to light cone coordinates , which does not interfere with our subsequent steps .    as a last example in fig.[fig : kato ] we show the decay @xmath156 with the exchange of two z bosons .",
    "this diagram has been calculated in @xcite by a five - dimensional numerical integration over the feynman parameters .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrated the calculation of the two - loop vertex function for the crossed topology .",
    "we outlined how to achieve the reduction to a manageable two - fold integral representation , and verified its correctness by comparison with the literature , wherever data were available .",
    "further , our integral representation was used in @xcite , with results in perfect agreement with the expectations .",
    "our results complement the results for the planar topology in @xcite .",
    "together , the scalar two - loop three - point function is now available in @xmath8 dimensions for all topologies , all masses , and arbitrary external momenta .",
    "some degenerated topologies were already given in @xcite , obtained by similar methods .",
    "such degenerated cases typically also appear when one confronts tensor integrals . for the future",
    ", we plan to incorporate such cases in the package xloops @xcite .",
    "also , code which implements the results presented here will be incorporated there .    to our knowledge ,",
    "no other method is at this stage able to deliver reliable results for the massive two - loop vertex function in such generality and accuracy .",
