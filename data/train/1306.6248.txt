    "if cooled below a critical temperature ( @xmath0k in @xmath1he and @xmath2 in at @xmath3hehe we mean the b - phase of @xmath3he ] at saturated vapour pressure ) , liquid helium undergoes bose - einstein condensation @xcite , becoming a quantum fluid and demonstrating superfluidity ( pure inviscid flow ) . besides the lack of viscosity",
    ", another major difference between superfluid helium and ordinary ( classical ) fluids such as water or air is that , in helium , vorticity is constrained to vortex line singularities of fixed circulation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is planck s constant , and @xmath6 is the mass of the relevant boson ( in the most common isotope @xmath1he , @xmath7 , the mass of an atom ; in the rare isotope @xmath3he , @xmath8 , the mass of a cooper pair ) .",
    "these vortex lines are essentially one - dimensional space curves , like the vortex lines of fluid dynamics textbooks ; for example , in @xmath1he the vortex core radius @xmath9 m is comparable to the inter atomic distance .",
    "this quantisation of the circulation thus results in the appearance of another characteristic length scale : the mean separation between vortex lines , @xmath10 . in typical experiments",
    "( both in @xmath1he and @xmath3he ) @xmath10 is orders of magnitude smaller than the outer scale of turbulence @xmath11 ( the scale of the largest eddies ) but is also orders of magnitudes larger than @xmath12 .",
    "there is a growing consensus @xcite that on length scales much larger than @xmath10 the properties of superfluid turbulence are similar to those of classical turbulence if excited similarly , for example by a moving grid .",
    "the idea is that motions at scales @xmath13 should involve at least a partial polarization @xcite of vortex lines and their organisation into vortex bundles which , at such large scales , should mimic continuous hydrodynamic eddies .",
    "therefore one expects a classical richardson - kolmogorov energy cascade , with larger `` eddies '' breaking into smaller ones .",
    "the spectral signature of this classical cascade is indeed observed experimentally in superfluid helium . in the absence of viscosity , in superfluid turbulence",
    "the kinetic energy should cascade downscale without loss , until it reaches the small scales where the quantum discreteness of vorticity is important .",
    "it is also believed that at this point the richardson - kolmogorov eddy - dominated cascade should be replaced by a second cascade which arises from the nonlinear interaction of kelvin waves ( helical perturbation of the vortex lines ) on individual vortex lines .",
    "this kelvin wave cascade should take the energy further downscale where it is radiated away by thermal quasi particles ( phonons and rotons in @xmath1he ) .",
    "although this scenario seems quite reasonable , crucial details are yet to be established .",
    "our understanding of superfluid turbulence at scales of the order of @xmath10 is still at infancy stage , and what happens at scales below @xmath10 is a question of intensive debates .",
    "the  quasi - classical \" region of scales , @xmath14 , is better understood , but still less than classical hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the main reason is that at nonzero temperatures ( but still below the critical temperature @xmath15 ) , superfluid helium is a two - fluid system . according to the theory of landau and tisza  @xcite , it consists of two inter  penetrating components : the inviscid superfluid , of density @xmath16 and velocity @xmath17 ( associated to the quantum ground state ) , and the viscous normal fluid , of density @xmath18 and velocity @xmath19 ( associated to thermal excitations ) .",
    "the normal fluid carries the entropy @xmath20 and the viscosity @xmath21 of the entire liquid . in the presence of superfluid",
    "vortices these two components interact via a mutual friction force@xcite .",
    "the total helium density @xmath22 is practically temperature independent , while the superfluid fraction @xmath23 is zero at @xmath24 , but rapidly increases if @xmath25 is lowered ( it becomes 50% at @xmath26 , 83% at @xmath27 and 95% at @xmath28 @xcite ) .",
    "the normal fluid is essentially negligible below @xmath29 .",
    "one would therefore expect classical behaviour only in the high temperature limit @xmath30 , where the normal fluid must energetically dominate the dynamics .",
    "experiments show that this is not the case , thus raising the interesting problem of",
    " double - fluid \" turbulence which we study here .",
    "the aim of this article is to present the current state of the art in this intriguing problem , clarify common features of turbulence in classical and quantum fluids , and highlight their differences . to achieve our aim",
    "we shall overview and combine experimental , theoretical and numerical results in the simplest possible ( and , probably , the most fundamental ) case of homogeneous , isotropic turbulence , away from boundaries and maintained in a statistical steady state by continuous mechanical forcing .",
    "the natural tools to study homogeneous isotropic turbulence are spectral , thus we shall consider the velocity spectrum ( also known as the energy spectrum ) and attempt to give a physical explanation for the observed phenomena .",
    "we recall that ordinary incompressible viscous flows are described by the navier - stokes equation @xmath31 = - \\frac{1}{\\rho}{{{\\bf{\\nabla } } } p}+\\nu { { { \\bf{\\nabla}}}^2 } { { \\bf{u}}},\\ ] ] and the solenoidal condition @xmath32 for the velocity field @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the pressure , @xmath35 the density , and @xmath36 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the dimensionless parameter that determines the properties of hydrodynamic turbulence is the reynolds number re@xmath37 .",
    "the reynolds number estimates the ratio of nonlinear and viscous terms in eq .   at the outer length scale @xmath11 ( typically the size of a streamlined body ) , where @xmath38 is the root mean square turbulent velocity fluctuation . in fully developed turbulence ( re@xmath39 )",
    "the @xmath11-scale eddies are unstable and give birth to smaller scale eddies , which , being unstable , generate further smaller eddies , and so on .",
    "this process is the richardson - kolmogorov energy cascade toward eddies of scale @xmath40 , defined as the length scale at which the nonlinear and viscous forces in eq .",
    "approximately balance each other .",
    "@xmath40-scale eddies are stable and their energy is dissipated into heat by viscous forces .",
    "the hallmark feature of fully developed turbulence is the coexistence of eddies of all scales from @xmath11 to @xmath41 with universal statistics ; the range of length scales @xmath42 where both energy pumping and dissipation can be ignored is called the inertial range .    in the study of homogeneous turbulence",
    "it is customary to consider the energy density per unit mass @xmath43 ( of dimensions @xmath44 ) . in the isotropic case the energy distribution between eddies of scale @xmath45",
    "can be characterized by the one  dimensional energy spectrum @xmath46 of dimensions @xmath44 ) with wavenumber defined as @xmath47 ( or as @xmath48 ) , normalized such that + @xmath49 where @xmath50 is volume . in the inviscid limit",

    "energy spectrum and energy flux are @xmath55independent , thus eq",
    ".   immediately dictates that the energy flux @xmath56 is @xmath57-independent . assuming that this constant @xmath56 is the only relevant characteristics of turbulence in the inertial interval and using dimensional reasoning , in 1941 kolmogorov and ( later ) obukhov suggested that the energy spectrum is @xmath58 where the ( dimensionless ) kolmogorov constant is approximately @xmath59 .",
    "this is the celebrated kolmogorov - obukhov @xmath60 law ( ko41 ) , verified in experiments and numerical simulations of eq .  ; it states in particular that in incompressible , steady , homogeneous , isotropic turbulence , the distribution of kinetic energy over the wavenumbers is @xmath61 .    in the inviscid limit",
    "the energy flux goes to smaller and smaller scales , reaching finally the interatomic scale and accumulating there . to describe this effect ,",
    "leith  @xcite suggested to replace the algebraic relation   between @xmath62 and @xmath63 by the differential form : @xmath64 this approximation dimensionally coincides with eq .  , but the derivative @xmath65/dk$ ] guarantees that @xmath66 if @xmath67 . the numerical factor @xmath68 , suggested in @xcite , fits the experimentally observed value @xmath69 in eq .  .",

    "[ f:3]a , and , underneath in the same figure , by the solid red line , although the latter occurs in slightly different contexts).a , the energy flux @xmath74 is not preserved along the cascade , but continuously decreases due to dissipation and ultimately vanishes at the maximum @xmath57 . ]",
    "we shall have also to keep in mind that although eq .",
    "is an important result of classical turbulence theory , it presents only the very beginning of the story .",
    "in particular , its well known @xcite that in the inertial range , the turbulent velocity field is not self  similar , but shows intermittency effects which modify the ko41 scenario .    in this paper",
    "we apply these ideas to superfluid helium , explain how to overcome technical difficulties to measure the energy spectrum near absolute zero , and draw the attention to three conceptual differences between classical hydrodynamic turbulence and turbulence in superfluid @xmath1he .",
    "the first difference is that the quantity which ( historically ) is most easily and most frequently detected in turbulent liquid helium is not the superfluid velocity but rather the vortex line density @xmath75 , defined as the superfluid vortex length per unit volume ; in most experiments ( and numerical simulations ) this volume is the entire cell ( or computational box ) which contains the helium .",
    "this scalar quantity @xmath75 has no analogy in classical fluid mechanics and should not be confused with the vorticity , whose spectrum , in the classical ko41 scenario , scales as @xmath76 correspondingly to the @xmath77 scaling of the velocity .",
    "notice that in a superfluid the vorticity is zero everywhere except on quantized vortex lines . in order to use as much as possible the toolkit of ideas and methods of classical hydrodynamics",
    ", we shall define in the next sections an `` effective '' superfluid vorticity field @xmath78 ; this definition ( which indeed @xcite yields the classical @xmath76 vorticity scaling corresponding to the @xmath77 velocity scaling ) is possible on scales that exceed the mean intervortex scale @xmath10 , provided that the vortex lines contained in a fluid parcel are sufficiently polarized .",
    "this procedure opens the way for a possible identification of `` local '' values of @xmath79 with the magnitude @xmath80 of the vector field @xmath78 .",
    "the second difference is that liquid helium is a two fluid system , and we expect both superfluid and normal fluid to be turbulent .",
    "this makes the problem of superfluid turbulence much richer than classical turbulence , but the analysis becomes more involved .",
    "for example , the existence of the intermediate scale @xmath10 makes it impossible to apply arguments of scale invariance to the entire inertial interval and calls for its separation into three ranges .",
    "the first is a `` hydrodynamic '' region of scales @xmath81 ( corresponding to @xmath82 in k - space where @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) , which is similar ( but not equal ) to the classical inertial range ; the second is a `` kelvin wave region '' @xmath85 where energy is transferred further to smaller scales in @xmath1he@xcite . ] by interacting kelvin waves ( helix - like deformations of the vortex lines ) . in the third , intermediate region @xmath86 ,",
    "the energy flux is caused probably by vortex reconnections .",
    "finally , the third difference is that mutual friction between normal and superfluid components leads to ( dissipative ) energy exchange between them in either direction .",
    "studies of classical turbulence are solidly based on the navier - stokes eq .  .",
    "unfortunately , there are no well established equations of motion for @xmath1he in the presence of superfluid vortices .",
    "we have only models at different levels of description ( for an overview see sec .",

    "the main difficulty in developing a theory of superfluid turbulence is the lack of an established set of equations of motion for he - ii in the presence of superfluid vortices .",

    "monte carlo models of the vortex core @xcite , although realistic , are not suitable for the study of the dynamics and turbulent motion .",
    "a practical model of a pure superfluid is the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for a weakly - interacting bose gas  @xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the complex condensate s wave function , @xmath100 the strength of the interaction between bosons , @xmath101 the chemical potential and @xmath6 the boson mass .",

    "it can be shown that , at length scales @xmath106 , the gpe reduces to the classical continuity equation and the ( compressible ) euler equation .",
    "it must be stressed that , although the gpe accounts for quantum vortices , finite vortex core size ( of the order of @xmath12 ) , vortex nucleation , vortex reconnections , sound emission by accelerating vortices and kelvin waves , it is only a qualitative model of the superfluid component .",
    "he - ii is a liquid , not a weakly - interacting gas , and the condensate is only a fraction of the superfluid density @xmath107 .",

    "the major drawback of the vfm is that the normal fluid @xmath126 is imposed ( either laminar or turbulent ) , therefore the back - reaction of the vortex lines on @xmath126 is not taken into account .",
