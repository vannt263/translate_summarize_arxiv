    "the investigation of systems involving ferromagnet ( f ) and superconductor ( s ) junctions is an active component of superconductor - based spintronics@xcite research .",
    "a broad array of interesting effects arises in s / f nanostructures , which opens doors for nanotechnologies and associated devices and applications that may offer benefits beyond current superconducting devices such as standard josephson junctions .",
    "advances in fabrication techniques permit growth of ferromagnet and superconductor layers in the form of junctions and heterostructures smooth up to the atomic scale .    the arrangement of consecutive f and s layers , as in sfs junctions , results in competition between magnetic and superconducting orderings .",
    "superconducting correlations can leak into the ferromagnet while spin polarization can extend into the superconductor : these are the now well established s / f proximity effects.@xcite the phase coherence embodied in the superconducting correlations becomes modified in the f regions .",
    "the exchange energy in the ferromagnet shifts the kinetic energies of the quasiparticles constituting the cooper pairs and subsequently a new superconducting state arises whereby the center of mass momentum of the pair is nonzero.@xcite this results in a spatially decaying pair amplitude that oscillates over a characteristic length scale much smaller than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "the modulating pair amplitude within the magnet indirectly links adjacent s layers , and thus proximity effects in f cause local oscillations in physically relevant single - particle quantities , including the magnetization@xcite and density of states@xcite ( dos ) .",
    "similarly , in the s material the magnet locally polarizes the superconductor , causing a monotonic decline in the pairing correlations near the interface over an extended region",
    ". the associated spin - split andreev quasiparticle states also lead to interesting local behavior in the dos and magnetic moment in the superconductor .",
    "the nontrivial behavior of the proximity effects in these structures plays a central role in the competition between the magnetic and superconducting order .",
    "the modification of the superconducting phase coherence due to proximity effects in clean multilayers consisting of one or more successive sfs junctions is particularly striking . on the atomic level ,",
    "the pair amplitude is a smoothly varying function of the spatial coordinates .",
    "depending on the values of certain parameters ( such as f layer width , @xmath3 ) the damped oscillatory pair amplitude in the f layer may arrange itself in such a manner that is energetically favorable for its sign to change from one of the s layers to the next , yielding a so - called @xmath1-junction , as first proposed long ago.@xcite if the pair amplitude does not change sign between s layers , it is an ordinary or @xmath0-junction .",
    "there is a rich and broad parameter space that then enables a certain level of control over the competing magnetic and superconducting orderings , allowing one to increase or diminish the proximity effects that dominate the relative sfs coupling .",
    "the actual equilibrium state ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) is dependent upon several variables , including predominantly the f region s material characteristics and the temperature , @xmath2 , all of which ultimately determine the pair amplitude modulation in the magnet .",
    "a system comprised of a larger number of sfs sequences results in a greater number of possible @xmath0 or @xmath1 junction combinations .",
    "the transitions between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states can be explored through the signatures of a variety of physical parameters .",
    "experimental study of this question has focused primarily on measurements of the critical current @xmath7@xcite and , thermodynamically , on the critical temperature@xcite of the transition to the normal state , @xmath6 .",
    "evidence of @xmath8 transitions can be seen in the sfs josephson coupling , which manifests itself in the vanishing of @xmath7 , although higher order harmonics in the current - phase relationship can modify this.@xcite measurements@xcite as a function of @xmath3 have shown that @xmath6 , which is of course smaller than @xmath9 , the critical temperature for bulk s material , oscillates as a function of @xmath3 , confirming theoretical predictions@xcite based upon the semi - classical usadel equations . intrinsically linked to this phenomenon are damped oscillations in @xmath7 as a function of @xmath3 and exchange energy in the clean@xcite and dirty limits.@xcite these changes in the critical current have been experimentally confirmed@xcite . of particular interest is ref .  , which demonstrates the robustness of @xmath8 transitions by providing evidence of switching in samples with interfaces that were not atomically smooth .",
    "indeed , despite deviations as large as @xmath10 over @xmath11 of a sample , clear evidence of switching was found .",
    "near @xmath6 , and in the diffusive limit , the theory was later extended to include arbitrary interface transparency.@xcite measurements of the superconducting phase@xcite have corroborated the @xmath1 state in sfs junctions , and the predicted oscillations in several thermodynamic quantities have in many cases been found experimentally .",
    "direct evidence of dos oscillations was reported in a tunneling spectroscopy experiment,@xcite but not observed@xcite in other cases .",
    "such studies give us the valuable insight that the oscillations are correlated with @xmath12 transitions . in this work",
    ", we show that there is indeed an intimate relation between the oscillations in @xmath6 as a function of relevant parameters and the transitions from the @xmath1 to the @xmath0 state and we find good quantitative agreement with experimental data .",
    "since the possibility of having a particular junction configuration depends fundamentally on the intricate properties of the pair amplitude , the complicated and demanding task of calculating the pair potential , @xmath13 , rigorously and self - consistently becomes absolutely necessary , particularly as the inhomogeneities occur on a microscopic scale .",
    "the first step in the self - consistency process often involves an assumed simple piecewise constant form for @xmath13 , which is then iterated through the relevant equations until convergence is achieved .",
    "it is not justified to bypass the technical difficulties associated with self - consistency and to use only an assumed form for the pair potential .",
    "the final calculated @xmath13 often deviates significantly , even in overall symmetry , from the assumed form : the self - consistent @xmath13 has a complicated spatial behavior that can lead to stable states mixing @xmath0 and @xmath1 junction configurations.@xcite a self - consistently calculated pair potential minimizes , at least locally , the free energy of the system . to determine whether the calculated state is merely a local minimum of the free energy or the global one ,",
    "the free energies from all possible self - consistent @xmath0- and @xmath1-junction configurations must be compared with high precision .",
    "recently developed numerical algorithms@xcite overcome the difficulties that arise in computing the small difference between much larger quantities and enable accurate computation of the differences in the values of the condensation free energy of different minima .",
    "for clean sfs junctions , a relevant set of basic parameters to consider includes @xmath3 , the exchange energy @xmath14 and @xmath2 .",
    "as these parameters vary , the @xmath0 or @xmath1-state free energies may cross at certain points in parameter space , yielding phase transitions .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that at @xmath15 , transitions occur when varying @xmath14 , @xmath3 and also the mismatch parameter @xmath4 , defined as the ratio of fermi energies in the f and s regions .",
    "this mismatch can induce a transition because at @xmath16 , when the fermi wavevectors match , the layers couple more strongly , while at small @xmath4 the coupling is effectively weaker .",
    "if the temperature varies it is also possible to have a first order transition between @xmath0 and @xmath1 junction states , as recently shown in both the clean,@xcite and dirty@xcite limits , and also predicted for short - period f / s superlattices.@xcite the temperature has been shown to have a pronounced effect on the pair amplitude in the f region of f / s structures,@xcite strongly diminishing its magnitude while maintaining its characteristic period of oscillation as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this translates into weaker coupling between adjacent s layers .",
    "if the magnet width is such that the junction is near a @xmath8 transition point at @xmath15 , increasing the temperature can result in the critical current of the junction having a non - monotonic temperature dependence.@xcite it has been argued@xcite that the transition is discontinuous in uniform samples but rounded off in samples of variable thickness.@xcite however , a transition can be observed@xcite in just a portion of samples with nonuniform thickness .",
    "these results indicate that the temperature can be used to switch between a @xmath0 and a @xmath1 state configuration .",
    "it is possible to locate regions of parameter space that give the desired transitions using the @xmath15 results as guides , however the task is still significantly demanding .",
    "such temperature transitions were found to occur in one - junction and 3-junction systems for moderate values of @xmath4.@xcite thus , a 1-junction system was found to have a @xmath17 first order transition as @xmath2 was lowered , and a @xmath18 transition was found for a 3-junction system.@xcite in each case , the free energies of a stable and a metastable state crossed at the transition temperature with differing derivatives , and therefore entropies .",
    "the existence of metastable states and an entropy discontinuity are hallmarks of first - order phase transitions .",
    "moreover , the reported latent heats were reported to be within available experimental resolution .",
    "it is therefore desirable to systematically study the coexistence of metastable states and the nature of the transition in sfs and higher - order multilayer structures .",
    "the main objective of this paper therefore , is to map out the regions of parameter space in which the different junction states are stable , and to trace the locations of the phase transitions in systems with sfs junctions .",
    "an extensive sweep of the geometric and materials parameters including @xmath3 , @xmath4 , as well as @xmath2 , is performed . to start with",
    ", it is important to know which @xmath3 and @xmath4 ranges allow more than one self - consistent state at @xmath15 .",
    "one can then check if a metastable state at low temperature becomes the equilibrium state at higher @xmath2 . by using this procedure",
    "we obtain a complete phase diagram of an sfs junction within the relevant region of @xmath19 space . to accomplish this ,",
    "we use a method that can accommodate arbitrary values of the above parameters , without recourse to approximations .",
    "as discussed above , all calculations involving the pair potential must be performed using fully self - consistent algorithms , starting from the microscopic equations ( bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) ) .",
    "the need for a fully microscopic theory arises because the characteristic period of the pair potential oscillations approaches the atomic scale .",
    "for the nanoscale interlayer widths considered here , geometrical oscillations decisively influence the final results .",
    "we present in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] the microscopic equations and the associated notation relevant for systems containing sfs junctions .",
    "we review the numerical procedures involved in calculating the self - consistent pair potential and quasiparticle spectra , and the method used to calculate the primary thermodynamic quantity , the condensation free energy , @xmath20 , from the self - consistent spectrum and pair potential .",
    "we also outline a semi - analytic method to calculate @xmath6 through the linearized bdg equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we show that first order transitions with measurable latent heat can occur between states containing different numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 junctions as the temperature changes . for sfs junctions the transitions we find are from the @xmath1 to the @xmath0 state as @xmath2 increases , as found in experiment,@xcite and occur predominantly in regions where @xmath6 is low . using the @xmath6 calculated from the linearized theory and the @xmath8 phase transitions ,",
    "we obtain the full phase diagram in an extended region of parameter space spanned by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we compare our calculated oscillations in @xmath6 as a function of @xmath3 with reported nb / co experimental data@xcite and find good agreement .",
    "the systems that we study consist of slabs of clean superconductor ( s ) material separated by ferromagnetic ( f ) layers .",
    "we will emphasize trilayers consisting of one sfs junction and , as a sample of what can generally occur in multilayers , present also results for seven layer systems consisting of three sfs junctions .",
    "the thickness of the s layers in an sfs junction is denoted by @xmath21 , and that of the f layers by @xmath3 .",
    "the seven layer system consists of three sfs junctions stacked together , so that the thickness of the two inner s layers is @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the layers are semi - infinite in the directions perpendicular to the interfaces ( the @xmath23 directions ) and that the interfaces are sharp .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity is confined to the @xmath24 direction , allowing us to model the system as quasi one dimensional .",
    "we assume parabolic bands , thus in the transverse direction @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the wavevector in the transverse direction and @xmath27 is the energy corresponding to the @xmath23 variables .",
    "we use the microscopic bogoliubov - degennes@xcite equations to study this inhomogeneous system . given a pair potential ( order parameter ) @xmath28 that is to be determined self consistently , the spin - up quasi - particle ( @xmath29 ) and spin - down quasi - hole ( @xmath30 ) amplitudes obey the bdg equations in the following form :    @xmath31    here , @xmath32 is a single - particle hamiltonian where @xmath33 is the kinetic energy term .",
    "the continuous variable @xmath27 is decoupled from the @xmath24 direction but of course it affects the eigenvalues @xmath34 .",
    "we describe the magnetism by an exchange field @xmath35 which takes the value @xmath14 in the f material and vanishes in s. within the superconducting layers , @xmath36 is equal to @xmath37 , the fermi energy of the s layers measured from the bottom of the band , while in the ferromagnet we have @xmath38 so that in the f regions the up and down band widths are @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . in the seven layer case",
    "we assume parallel orientation of the magnetization in all f layers .",
    "one should not assume that @xmath41 and we therefore introduce the dimensionless fermi wavevector mismatch parameter @xmath4 by @xmath42 .",
    "usually , one has @xmath43 .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the dimensionless magnetic strength variable @xmath44 by @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 limit corresponds to the `` half - metallic '' case .",
    "we neglect interfacial scattering .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be written down from symmetry relations.@xcite    the required self - consistency condition for the pair potential @xmath28 is : @xmath49 where here and below the prime indicates a summation over states for which @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the usual cutoff `` debye '' energy and it is understood that the index @xmath52 includes @xmath26 as well as the longitudinal variables .",
    "the bcs coupling @xmath53 is taken to be a constant @xmath54 in the superconductor and zero in the ferromagnet .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : bdg ] )  and  ( [ eq : sc ] ) comprise a non - linear set of equations .",
    "exact solutions to this set must be computed in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we follow the procedure@xcite used in previous work ; we omit the repetition of the technical details .",
    "we begin with an assumed form for @xmath28 , either from a prior calculation with similar parameters or an _ a priori _ guess ( usually a stepwise function ) , and then numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdg ] ) for every value of @xmath27 in the appropriate range to compute @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath34 .",
    "an expansion of all quantities in terms of sine waves is used@xcite to carry out the solution .",
    "the required matrix elements are given , for our geometries , in ref .  .",
    "this resulting energy spectrum and quasiparticle amplitudes are used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc ] ) to compute a new @xmath28 .",
    "we then feed this new @xmath28 back into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bdg ] ) and repeat this process until the fractional difference between the average of successive solutions for @xmath28 is less than a threshold value that we take to be @xmath55 .",
    "solutions obtained in this way are exact up to the chosen numerical precision .    the self - consistent solution for a trilayer sfs junction can be of the @xmath1 or the @xmath0 type , with the pair potential either changing or not changing sign across the f layer , respectively .",
    "more complicated situations can occur in multilayers : for a three junction system one can encounter four symmetric states ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , with each symbol corresponding to the state of each junction ) .",
    "when , for a given temperature and set of geometrical and material parameters such as @xmath44 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , several@xcite different self - consistent solutions , that is , local minima in the free energy , exist , the stable state must be determined by comparing the condensation free energies of the competing self - consistent states . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , when the equilibrium state changes as a function of temperature  @xcite a first order phase transition can occur , with a corresponding latent heat .",
    "one of the chief goals of this paper is to study an extended region of parameter space , locating where such transitions exist and then mapping out the corresponding phase diagram .    to evaluate the free energy , @xmath60 , of the self - consistent states we use the formula from ref .",
    ":    @xmath61 + \\frac{1}{d}\\int_0^d\\frac{\\delta^2(z)}{g(z)}dz , \\label{eq : free}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 is the total thickness of the system in the @xmath24-direction . in this expression , only the energy eigenvalues appear explicitly , the eigenfunctions appearing only indirectly through the self - consistent @xmath63 it is equivalent to several other expressions found in the literature which contain the quasi - particle amplitudes explicitly , but it is computationally much more convenient .    the condensation free energy is defined as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the free energy of the superconducting state and @xmath66 that of the non - superconducting system .",
    "we compute @xmath66 by setting @xmath67 in equations  ( [ eq : bdg ] ) and  ( [ eq : free ] ) .",
    "calculating @xmath68 is a significant numerical challenge : recall that in a bulk superconductor@xcite @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the usual density of states and @xmath71 is the order parameter for the bulk superconductor at @xmath15 , which is several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath72 .",
    "hence , to obtain @xmath73 we must subtract two numerically obtained large quantities in order to extract a difference several orders of magnitude smaller than the terms subtracted .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see , the difference in condensation free energies of competing self - consistent states ( when they occur ) is only a small fraction of the condensation free energy of each of them . to obtain sufficiently accurate values of @xmath73 requires therefore a very high degree of precision in calculating @xmath65 and @xmath66 so that we can distinguish the relatively small differences between competing states to locate phase transitions .",
    "this situation is made more challenging by the need to calculate derivatives of @xmath73 to obtain thermodynamic functions and latent heats .",
    "while the transition temperature @xmath6 from the non - superconducting to the superconducting state can be numerically calculated as the temperature at which @xmath73 vanishes , it is much easier to evaluate @xmath6 by treating @xmath28 as a small parameter and linearizing the equations . in this way",
    "the calculation is nearly entirely analytic .",
    "the amplitudes are written as @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( we have dropped the spin indices for simplicity ) .",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath77 terms are computed from the zeroth order equation , which is obtained by setting @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdg ] ) .",
    "the form of the zeroth order equation implies that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are completely decoupled and have distinct energy spectra , denoted by @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively . proceeding to calculate the lowest order corrections , we incorporate quasiparticle coupling through the pair potential matrix .",
    "one can then obtain @xmath83 and @xmath84 from textbook perturbation formulas .",
    "the intermediate sums are in principle over the entire zeroth order spectrum .",
    "but as a practical matter it is enough to include in these sums energies @xmath85 and @xmath86 within a few @xmath51 of the fermi level .",
    "we then expand the quasiparticle amplitudes and their first order corrections in a sine wave basis @xmath87 , e.g. @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "the range of the sums over @xmath92 is formally infinite , but again it is only necessary to sum up to a wavenumber @xmath93 with an associated energy a few @xmath51 from @xmath94 . inserting these expansions into eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc ] ) gives the lowest order correction to @xmath28 , which we then expand in the @xmath87 basis . upon taking into account the orthogonality of the basis functions , the expanded eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc ] ) is then transformed into the matrix equation @xmath95 where the @xmath96 are the expansion coefficients of @xmath28 in terms of @xmath97 .",
    "one finds after straightforward algebra :    @xmath98    here we have used @xmath99 .",
    "the integral over @xmath27 reflects the dependence of the zeroth order quasiparticle amplitudes and energies on @xmath27 , and the sum over @xmath52 is here only over longitudinal quantum numbers with the prime denoting the limitation indicated below eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc ] ) on the energies @xmath81 and @xmath81 .",
    "the transition temperature can then be found , in analogy with standard procedures,@xcite by treating eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) as an eigenvalue equation for the matrix @xmath100 . at the transition temperature",
    "@xmath6 the largest eigenvalue is unity , while if @xmath101 all eigenvalues are less than unity . unlike the free energy method described in subsection  [ sub : self ] , this procedure does not require an iterative process and only the last step ( finding the eigenvalue ) must in practice be performed numerically .",
    "therefore this method is much more efficient , and it also provides a check on the numerics of our free energy .      from the self - consistent amplitudes and an energy spectrum we can also calculate other quantities of interest such as the density of states ( dos ) and the magnetization .",
    "the local density of states is @xmath102 ^ 2f^\\prime(\\epsilon-\\epsilon_n)+ \\left[v_n^\\sigma(z)\\right]^2f^\\prime(\\epsilon+\\epsilon_n)\\right ] , \\label{eq : dos}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 denotes spin and @xmath104 is the first derivative of the fermi function .",
    "one can also omit the sum over @xmath103 and obtain the spin dependent dos .",
    "similarly , we have the average number density for each spin subband , @xmath105 ^ 2f(\\epsilon_n ) + \\left[v_n^\\sigma(z)\\right]^2\\left[1-f(\\epsilon_n)\\right ] \\right\\}. \\label{eq : spol}\\ ] ] this leads to the dimensionless magnetization , @xmath106 , @xmath107 which reduces to @xmath108/ \\left[(1+i)^{3/2}+(1-i)^{3/2}\\right]$ ] for bulk f material , within our assumptions .",
    "this expression is in numerical agreement with our results from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mz ] ) in sufficiently thick f layers .",
    "in this section we present and discuss our results .",
    "as explained above , trilayers consisting of one sfs junction will be emphasized but results for seven layer systems comprised of three stacked sfs junctions will also be given in order to show that the single junction results can indeed be generalized to multilayer samples .",
    "we will first discuss the results for the thermodynamics and the phase transitions that ensue .",
    "this will include a detailed discussion of the phase diagram for the sfs trilayer in the most interesting region of the three dimensional space spanned by @xmath2 , @xmath4 and the f layer thickness .",
    "a discussion of the properties of the transition temperature @xmath6 as a function of @xmath3 and a comparison with experiment follow .",
    "we will also discuss other quantities of interest , such as the pair amplitude , the density of states , and the magnetization .",
    "the results presented below will be given in terms of convenient dimensionless quantities .",
    "we measure all the lengths in units of @xmath109 , the fermi wavevector in s. we fix @xmath110 .",
    "we have taken the bcs coherence length @xmath111 equal to @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath21 of order of or larger than @xmath111 , results are only weakly dependent on @xmath21 , hence our results are applicable to a very wide range of values of this variable , provided @xmath21 is not too small . the dimensionless thickness @xmath112 of the ferromagnetic layers will be varied over the range of interest , which corresponds to relatively small values , since at large ones the f / s proximity effects are negligible .",
    "similarly , we introduce the notation @xmath113 .",
    "the magnetic strength parameter is taken to be @xmath114 unless otherwise noted .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath44 are physically similar to those of varying @xmath115 since the pair amplitude oscillations in f are governed@xcite by the difference @xmath116 between fermi wavevectors in the spin bands in f. the fermi wavevector mismatch parameter , @xmath4 , to which results are quite sensitive , is varied over the experimentally relevant range @xmath117 . the temperature is measured in units of @xmath9 , the critical temperature of a bulk sample of the material s. we choose @xmath118 ; the dimensionless quantities calculated are not sensitive to this choice .",
    "condensation free energies will be given in units of @xmath119 , twice the absolute value of the condensation free energy of a bulk superconducting sample of the same total thickness at @xmath15 .",
    "a dimensionless measure of the latent heats will be given by dividing the corresponding entropy discontinuities by @xmath120 , the specific heat of a sample of the same overall thickness but consisting exclusively of the s material in its normal metal state at @xmath9 .",
    "we performed several checks of our numerical methods .",
    "we verified that the temperature at which the self - consistent condensation free energy goes to zero is in each case the same as the transition temperature obtained from the linearized solution to the bdg equations . for a sample with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we quantitatively recovered the well established results@xcite for the thermodynamics , including the second order phase transition at @xmath9 and the associated specific heat discontinuity",
    ". furthermore , the spatially averaged dos computed numerically for this system shows a well defined gap at energies within @xmath71 of @xmath94 and the characteristic divergence at @xmath123 .",
    "this test is very severe since our numerical method must necessarily be more accurate for smaller systems , where fewer variables are required .",
    "thus the ability of our numerical procedures to handle the relatively large systems ( over six superconducting correlation lengths thick ) considered here is verified .",
    "the low temperature limit was extensively checked in ref .  , and it was also previously verified@xcite that our methods give the correct thickness dependence of @xmath28 for a superconducting slab as found in the literature@xcite .",
    "the basic quantity that determines the phase transitions and the entire thermodynamics is the condensation free energy , @xmath68 .",
    "we will therefore begin our exposition by describing some of our results for @xmath68 at a few parameter values representative of the regions where the phase transition behavior is richest .",
    "we begin with fig .",
    "[ fig : ft3l ] which shows , for an sfs trilayer , the self - consistent condensation free energy @xmath20 plotted versus reduced temperature @xmath124 .",
    "data points were obtained at @xmath125 intervals .",
    "the values of @xmath115 and @xmath4 for which results are shown were chosen to be such that , at @xmath15 , self - consistent solutions of both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 states are found to exist . in each panel ,",
    "the free energies of the two competing states are shown .",
    "the thermodynamically stable state is of course the one with the lower free energy . the slope of @xmath20 approaches zero as @xmath126 , which indicates that the calculated entropy vanishes at @xmath15 as required by the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "the slope also approaches zero as @xmath127 , indicating that the transition to the normal state is of second order , without latent heat .",
    "the temperature at which this second order phase transition occurs , @xmath6 , is the temperature at which the lower @xmath20 vanishes .",
    "the @xmath6 found this way agrees with the independently calculated @xmath6 using the linearized bdg equations .",
    "the inherent finite - size and proximity effects cause @xmath6 to be considerably smaller than @xmath9 in all cases .",
    "two outstanding features of the results shown in this figure are the existence of a metastable state at all temperatures from zero up to @xmath6 and a first order phase transition at an intermediate temperature : the free energies of the two competing states cross at @xmath128 . in all cases",

    "the position of @xmath129 is marked by the vertical arrow in each panel .",
    "the value of @xmath129 changes smoothly as @xmath115 or @xmath4 are changed .",
    "one can see by comparing top and bottom panels how @xmath129 changes with @xmath115 at constant @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ft3l ] one can see the difference in slope between the stable state and the metastable state at @xmath129 , particularly apparent in the right panels .",
    "the existence of a metastable state and the discontinuity in the slope of the free energy of the stable state ( i.e. , the entropy ) at @xmath129 indicate the existence of a first order phase transition with an associated latent heat . that any such transition should be first order",

    "the phase transition behavior is exceptionally rich . in many other regions of @xmath4 and @xmath115 parameter space",
    "the behavior is simpler : in some there is only one self consistent solution to the bdg equations at @xmath15 , while for other ranges of @xmath4 and @xmath115 a metastable state is found at low temperature but it never becomes the stable state as @xmath2 increases .",
    "it is only in some regions of parameter space that @xmath8 transitions occur as a function of @xmath2 .",

    "<S> we study the thermodynamics of clean , layered superconductor / ferromagnet nanostructures using fully self consistent methods to solve the microscopic bogoliubov - degennes equations . from these self - consistent solutions the condensation </S>",
    "<S> free energies are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the trilayer sfs junction is studied in particular detail : first order transitions between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states as a function of the temperature @xmath2 are located by finding where the free energies of the two phases cross . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of these transitions is mapped as a function of the thickness @xmath3 of the f layer and of the fermi wavevector mismatch parameter @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> similar first order transitions are found for systems with a larger number of layers : examples are given in the 7 layer ( 3 junction ) case . </S>",
    "<S> the latent heats associated with these phase transitions are evaluated and found to be experimentally accessible . </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperature to the normal state is calculated from the linearized bogoliubov - degennes equations and found to be in good agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the whole three dimensional phase diagram in @xmath5 space can be found . </S>",
    "<S> the first order transitions are associated with dips in the transition temperature @xmath6 to the non - superconducting state , which should facilitate locating them . </S>",
    "<S> results are given also for the magnetic moment and the local density of states ( dos ) at the first order transition . </S>"
