    "in einstein s general relativity , naked singularities have been shown to exist under quite general assumptions as exact solutions of the corresponding field equations @xcite . indeed , each one of the black hole solutions possesses a naked singularity counterpart that appears as soon as the black hole parameters violate the condition for the existence of an event horizon .",
    "many other naked singularity solutions are known for which no black hole counterpart exists @xcite .",
    "this means that naked singularities are well - defined mathematical solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "the interesting question is whether these mathematical solutions describe physical configurations that could exist in nature .",
    "the answer to this question is negative , if the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite turns out to be true . indeed , according to this conjecture , a physically realistic gravitational collapse , which evolves from a regular initial state , can never lead to the formation of a naked singularity ; that is , all singularities resulting from a gravitational collapse should always be enclosed within an event horizon so that they can not be observed from outside the horizon .",
    "many attempts have been made to prove the cosmic censorship hypothesis with the same mathematical rigor used to show the inevitability of singularities in general relativity @xcite .",
    "so far , no general proof has been formulated and the investigation of several particular scenarios of gravitational collapse corroborate the correctness of the conjecture .",
    "other studies studies @xcite , however , indicate that under certain circumstances naked singularities can appear during the evolution of a mass distribution into a gravitational collapse .",
    "it has been shown that in an inhomogeneous collapse , there exists a critical degree of inhomogeneity below which black holes form .",
    "naked singularities appear if the degree of inhomogeneity is bigger than the critical value @xcite .",
    "the collapse speed and the shape of the collapsing object are also factors playing an important role in the determination of the final state .",
    "naked singularities form more frequently if the collapse occurs very rapidly and the object is not exactly spherically symmetric .",
    "these results indicate that the probability of existence of naked singularities can not be neglected _ a priori_. in view of this fact , one of the main goals of our work is to investigate the physical effects around naked singularities , showing possible regions of repulsive gravity .",
    "the simplest case of naked singularity is the schwarzschild spacetime with negative mass .",
    "the naked singularity is situated at the origin of coordinates and the entire spacetime represents a repulsive gravitational field .",
    "one can interpret this case as represented by an effective mass which follows from the corresponding newtonian limit , and is always negative .",
    "this interpretation can be generalized to other spacetimes , leading however to certain difficulties as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : meff ] .",
    "other definitions of effective mass show a completely different behavior @xcite .",
    "one may also try to define repulsive gravity in terms of invariants of the curvature tensor @xcite , although several problems appear .",
    "in particular , the schwarzschild naked singularity is characterized by the same curvature invariants as the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "analogously , the use of null cones to define repulsive gravity is also not free of difficulties @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to propose and test an approach based upon an invariant representation of the curvature tensor and its eigenvalues .",
    "a preliminary study of this idea was presented in @xcite .",
    "the region where repulsive gravity can become dominant is defined in an invariant way by considering the behavior of the curvature tensor eigenvalues . to this end ,",
    "the extremal points of the eigenvalues are considered as indicating a change in the behavior of gravity .",
    "we will show that this definition can be applied to different types of naked singularities , and in all the analyzed cases the obtained results are physically reasonable .",
    "in fact , we will see that the repulsion region is always located at a very short distance from the central gravity source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : meff ] , we investigate the behavior of the effective mass as a possibility to determine the regions of spacetime where repulsive gravity can occur . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cur ] , we introduce the formalism to find the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor in an invariant manner , and define a repulsion radius that determines the region where repulsive gravity can become dominant . in sec .",

    "the most general black hole spacetime in einstein - maxwell theory is described by the kerr - newman metric that in boyer - lindquist coordinates can be written as @xcite @xmath0 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & &    - { \\frac{r^2 + a^2\\cos^2 \\theta } { r^2 - 2mr + a^2+q^2}}dr^2 - ( r^2 + a^2\\cos^2\\theta)d\\theta^2 \\ , \\label{kn } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the mass of the rotating central object , @xmath2 is the specific angular momentum , and @xmath3 represents the total electric charge .",
    "the corresponding electromagnetic vector potential a=- , indicates that the magnetic field is generated by the rotation of the charge distribution .",
    "the limiting cases of the kerr - newman metric are the kerr metric for @xmath4 , the schwarzschild metric which is recovered for @xmath5 , the reissner - nordstrm spacetime for @xmath6 , and the minkowski metric of special relativity for @xmath7 .",
    "the kerr - newman spacetime is asymptotically flat and free of curvature singularities outside a region situated very close to the origin of coordinates .",
    "indeed , the central ring singularity is determined by the roots of the equation r^2 + a^2 ^2=0  , and is covered from the outside spacetime by two horizons situated at r _",
    "m , which are real quantities only if the condition @xmath8 is satisfied . in this case ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the radius of the outer and inner horizon , respectively , and the kerr - newman solution is interpreted as describing the exterior field of a rotating charged black hole . in the case",
    "@xmath11 , no horizons exist and the gravitational field corresponds to that of a naked ring singularity .    the newtonian potential @xmath12 and the effective mass are usually computed from the metric component @xmath13 as _ r g_tt = 1 - 2 = 1 -  . in the case of the kerr - newman spacetime , we obtain @xcite m_eff = m - -  , where we neglected all terms proportional to @xmath14 and higher .",
    "since the effective mass depends on the radius @xmath15 , it then follows that near the origin of coordinates the effective mass can become negative .",
    "the effective mass can be therefore interpreted as a source for generating possible repulsive gravitational fields @xcite .    in the regions where the effective mass is positive ,",
    "the gravitational field becomes attractive so that the limit of the repulsion region is determined by the zero of the effective mass function , @xmath16 , i.e. , r_rep^n = ( q^2 + ) . in the limiting case of the reissner - nordstrm spacetime ( @xmath6 ) , the repulsion region lies inside the sphere with radius @xmath17 .",
    "interestingly , this radius is located inside the classical radius of a charged particle with mass @xmath1 and charge @xmath3 , @xmath18 which is usually interpreted as the radius of a sphere inside which quantum effects become important @xcite .",
    "this fact makes difficult the physical interpretation of the repulsion region as a classical ( non quantum ) effect . in the case of a kerr spacetime @xmath19",
    ", the repulsion region depends on the azimuthal angle , reaching its maximum value on the axis and its minimum value on the equatorial plane .",
    "although the above definition of the repulsive gravity region is very simple and intuitive , it is based on assuming the newtonian potential .",
    "thus , the regions of repulsive gravity would depend on the choice of coordinates , and can not be defined in a coordinate independent way .",
    "indeed , some time ago ehlers @xcite noticed that the computation of the newtonian potential leads to contradictory results when different coordinate systems are used .",
    "ehlers introduced a general theory ( rahmentheorie ) in which newtonian gravity and einstein s general relativity are considered as particular theories and the newtonian limit is mathematically well defined .",
    "it can be shown that using ehlers rahmentheorie , the newtonian limit of the kerr - newman metric does not depend on the specific angular momentum @xcite . in some sense , this result is expected because in newtonian s gravity the rotation is not a source of gravity . we conclude that the newtonian approximation is not suitable for investigating repulsive gravity in an invariant manner .",
    "in general relativity , it is necessary to use invariant quantities , e.g. scalars , to describe physical phenomena independently of the choice of coordinates or observers .",
    "since curvature is interpreted as a measure of the gravitational interaction , it is reasonable to use the curvature invariants to analyze the behavior of gravity . from the components of the riemann curvature tensor",
    ", one can build in general 14 functionally independent scalars . in the case of empty space ,",
    "only four scalars are linearly independent @xcite . in the case of scalars that are quadratic in the components of the curvature tensor",
    ", one can form the following combinations @xcite    [ aiuto1 ] @xmath20_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}r^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\,,\\\\ k_3 = [ { } ^*r{}^*]{}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}r^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the asterisk represents dual conjugation .",
    "they are known as the kretschmann invariant , the chern - pontryagin invariant , and the euler invariant , respectively .",
    "those invariants have been employed also for describing the effects of dark matter and dark energy in late time cosmology @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that both the effects of dark matter and dark energy may be described in terms of a single scheme , by means of eqs .",
    "( [ aiuto1 ] ) . indeed , for describing repulsive effects due to the antigravitational behavior of dark energy ,",
    "one may include the kretschmann invariants as a source for the whole energy momentum tensor .",
    "the behavior of the above invariants has been proposed to determine the  repulsive domains \" of gravity and negative effective masses in curved spacetimes @xcite ; however , their quadratic structure does not allow us to consider all possible cases of naked singularities .",
    "indeed , for the schwarzschild spacetime one obtains @xmath21 whereas @xmath22 and @xmath23 are proportional to @xmath24 . since the change @xmath25 does not affect the behavior of @xmath24",
    ", these invariants do not acknowledge the existence of a schwarzschild naked singularity .",
    "rephrasing it differently , a schwarzschild black hole and a corresponding naked singularity have the same quadratic invariants .",
    "similar difficulties appear in more general cases like the kerr and kerr - newman naked singularities .",
    "it is worth noticing that the ricci scalar , which is the only linear invariant in the curvature tensor components , is not suitable for investigating the problem of repulsive gravity , because it vanishes identically for all the above naked singularity solutions .",
    "hence , the need for addressing the problem of using first order invariants to characterize repulsive effects becomes essential in order to describe naked singularities . to this end , here we propose an alternative approach in which the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor play the most important role .",
    "there are different ways to determine these eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "our strategy is to use local tetrads and differential forms . from the physical point of view ,",
    "a local orthonormal tetrad is the simplest and most natural choice for an observer in order to perform local measurements of time , space , and gravity .",
    "moreover , once a local orthonormal tetrad is chosen , all the quantities related to this frame are invariant with respect to coordinate transformations .",
    "the only freedom remaining in the choice of this local frame is a lorentz transformation .",
    "so , let us choose the orthonormal tetrad as ds^2 = g _ dx^dx^= _ ab^a^b  , with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . the first d^a = - ^a _  b d^b  , and second cartan equations ^a _  b = d^a _  b + ^a _  c ^c _  b = r^a _",
    "bcd ^c^d allow us to compute the components of the riemann curvature tensor in the local orthonormal frame .",
    "it is convenient to decompose the curvature tensor in terms of its irreducible parts with respect to the lorentz group which are the weyl tensor @xcite w_abcd = r_abcd+2_[a|[cr_d]|b]+ r_a[d_c]b  , [ weyl ] the trace - free ricci tensor e_abcd = 2_[b|[cr_d]|a ] - r_a[d_c]b  , [ trace ] and the curvature scalar s_abcd = - r_a[d_c]b  , [ scal ] where the ricci tensor is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "it is possible to represent the curvature tensor as a ( 6@xmath296)-matrix by introducing the bivector indices @xmath30 which encode the information of two different tetrad indices , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "we follow the convention proposed in @xcite which establishes the following correspondence between tetrad and bivector indices 011  , 022  , 033  , 234  , 315  , 126  .",
    "this correspondence can be applied to all the irreducible components of the riemann tensor given in eqs.([weyl])([scal ] ) so that the bivector representation can be expressed as r_ab = w_ab + e_ab + s_ab  , with @xmath32    here @xmath1 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 real symmetric matrices , whereas @xmath3 is antisymmetric .",
    "we see that all the independent components of the riemann tensor are contained in the ( 3@xmath293)-matrices @xmath1 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath3 and the scalar @xmath36 .",
    "this suggests to introduce a further representation of the curvature tensor by using only ( 3@xmath293)-matrices . indeed , noting that ( [ so31 ] ) represents the irreducible pieces of the curvature with respect to the lorentz group @xmath37 that is isomorphic to the group @xmath38 , it is possible to introduce a local complex basis where the curvature is given as a ( 3@xmath293)-matrix . this is the so - called @xmath38-representation of the riemann tensor whose irreducible pieces can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath39    notice that the einstein equations can be written as algebraic equations in this representation .",
    "for instance , in the case of vacuum spacetime we have that @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the vanishing of the ricci tensor in terms of the components of the riemann tensor corresponds to the algebraic condition @xmath42 .",
    "the matrix @xmath43 has therefore only ten independent components , the matrix @xmath44 is hermitian with nine independent components and the scalar piece @xmath36 has only one component .",
    "the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor correspond to the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath45 .",
    "in general , they are complex @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "it is with respect to these curvature eigenvalues that the petrov classification of gravitational fields is carried out .",
    "as mentioned above , in the case of a vacuum solution the curvature matrix is traceless and hence the eigenvalues must satisfy the condition @xmath48 . moreover , the case @xmath49 is the most general type in petrov s classification and is called type i. vacuum solutions with @xmath50 correspond to type d gravitational fields .",
    "all the naked singularities we will study here belong to type i or d @xcite .",
    "since curvature eigenvalues characterize in an invariant manner the gravitational field in petrov s classification , we propose to use them to identify the repulsive behavior of gravity .",
    "our motivation is based upon the intuitive idea that a change in the gravitational field must generate a change at the level of the eigenvalues , since curvature is a measure of the gravitational interaction .",
    "if repulsive gravity is interpreted as the  opposite \" of attractive gravity , the curvature eigenvalues should be able to reproduce this behavior . in the case of compact gravitational sources ,",
    "e.g. black holes or naked singularities , the idea is to assume that the eigenvalues vanish at spatial infinity as a consequence of the asymptotic flatness condition .",
    "as we approach the central source , the eigenvalues will increase in value until they become infinity at the singularity .",
    "if gravity is everywhere attractive , one would expect that the eigenvalues increase monotonically from zero at spatial infinity until they reach their maximum value near the curvature singularity .",
    "however , if gravity becomes repulsive in some region , one would expect a different behavior for the eigenvalues ; in particular , if repulsive gravity becomes dominant at a given point , one would expect at that point a change in the sign of at least one eigenvalue .",
    "the point where the eigenvalue vanishes would indicate that attractive gravity becomes entirely compensated by the action of repulsive gravity .",
    "this implies that the eigenvalue must have an extremal at some point before it changes its sign . according to this intuitive analysis",
    ", we propose to define the radius of repulsion @xmath51 as the first extremal that appears in a curvature eigenvalue as we approach the origin of coordinates from infinity , i.e. , | _ r = r_rep=0  , [ rep ] where @xmath52 is any curvature eigenvalue and @xmath15 is a radial coordinate .",
    "in other words , the repulsion radius is the radial distance from the origin to the position of farthest extremal .",
    "this radius determines the region where it should be possible to detect the effects of repulsive gravity , for instance , by using test particles .",
    "we will see in the following sections that the above purely intuitive motivation , which is the basis of our definition of repulsion radius , leads to physically reasonable results in several examples .",
    "to study the structure of the curvature tensor of the kerr - newman naked singularities represented by the line element ( [ kn ] ) , it is convenient to introduce the orthonormal tetrad    @xmath53 \\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\vartheta^2 = &    ( r^2 + a^2\\cos^2 \\theta)^{1/2 } d\\theta\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\vartheta^3 = &     \\left(\\frac { r^2 + a^2\\cos^2 \\theta}{r^2 - 2mr + a^2 + q^2}\\right)^{1/2 } dr     \\ . \\label{tetrad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , using the cartan equations and the matrix formalism presented in the previous section , is is straightforward to show that the @xmath35 curvature matrix can be written as =(    ccc l &  0 & 0 + 0 &  l & 0 + 0 &  0 & -2 l + k +    ) , [ knc ] with l= - ( ) ^3  , [ funl ] k = -  .",

    "in fact , we can see that @xmath97 as well as @xmath51 define a similar geometric structure for the repulsion regions , but in general the only difference is that @xmath98 in all the cases ( the exterior repulsion radius in the kerr - newman spacetime ) .",
    "so , for instance , in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime , the alternative repulsion radius coincides with the classical radius @xmath99 .",
    "this choice , however , does not agree with the results obtained by analyzing the motion of test particles in this spacetime .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown that a particle located at the classical radius can remain  at rest \" ( zero angular momentum ) with respect to an observer situated at infinity .",
    "this means that the classical radius corresponds to the place where repulsive gravity entirely compensates attractive gravity and , therefore , can not be considered as a definition for the onset of repulsion .",
    "moreover , inside the classical radius no timelike circular orbits are allowed .",
    "it is also interesting to note that at the classical radius the weyl part of the curvature tensor ( [ curvrn ] ) vanishes , which could be interpreted as a spot of  zero gravity \" .",
    "the definition proposed here in eq.([rep ] ) yields in this case @xmath100 , which is greater than the classical radius and , therefore , more suitable to be used as the definition of the onset of repulsive gravity .",
    "the repulsion region as defined here is located in all the cases near the origin of coordinates so that repulsive effects are expected to become very important only in the vicinity of the central compact object .",
    "this result is confirmed by a different study in which the circular motion of test particles has been investigated for black holes and naked singularities @xcite .",
