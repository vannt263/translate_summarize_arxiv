    "the known number of glitching radio pulsars has quadrupled in the last four years , as has the total number of glitches , in the wake of the parkes multibeam survey and improved multifrequency timing solutions @xcite . out of a total population of @xmath6 pulsars ,",
    "@xmath7 have experienced a total of @xmath8 glitches @xcite .",
    "the enlarged data set invites an updated statistical study .",
    "previous analyses identified certain empirical trends , e.g. , glitch activity and healing parameter versus characteristic age @xcite , and glitch amplitude versus recurrence time @xcite , while refuting certain theoretically predicted correlations , e.g. , glitch amplitude versus spin period @xmath9 , period derivative @xmath10 , and total spin down since the last glitch (  reservoir model \" ) @xcite .    on the theoretical front , the global pattern of superfluid circulation in the outer core of a neutron star was recently computed numerically for the first time @xcite . in general , a fluid contained in a differentially rotating , spherical shell flows unsteadily under a wide range of conditions , especially in thick shells and at high reynolds numbers @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such unsteady flow is observed in numerical and laboratory experiments with viscous fluids , e.g. , transitions between taylor vortex states @xcite , taylor vortex oscillations @xcite , relaminarization @xcite , and nonaxisymmetric modes on the route to high-@xmath1 turbulence , like taylor - grtler vortices @xcite .",
    "time - dependent flow is also observed in superfluids like helium ii , e.g. , torque  steps \" and quasiperiodic torque oscillations in couette and spin - up experiments @xcite .    in this letter , we combine theory and observation to test whether superfluid turbulence exists in neutron stars , as originally proposed by @xcite . in  [ sec : hydro ] , we present numerical simulations of a @xmath11s@xmath12-paired neutron superfluid in the outer core of a neutron star as the crust spins down electromagnetically .",
    "we show that the torque is steady for @xmath13 and unsteady ( e.g. , oscillatory ) otherwise . in  [ sec : reynolds ] , we combine standard cooling curves with measurements of the characteristic ages of radio pulsars to compute the temperature , viscosity , and hence @xmath1 of the star . we show that the @xmath1 distributions of those pulsars that glitch , and those that do not , are different  a rare instance of regularity in the glitch phenomenon .",
    "the implications for the existence of superfluid turbulence in neutron stars are weighed critically in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "large - scale , time - dependent , meridional circulation , driven by ekman pumping , is a generic feature of viscous and superfluid flow in spherical couette geometry ( i.e. , a differentially rotating , spherical shell ) ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "the complexity of the global circulation pattern increases with @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is large enough , the flow becomes nonaxisymmetric and ultimately chaotic , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : re11 ] compares spherical couette flow of a two - component , hall - vinen - bekarevich - khalatnikov ( hvbk ) superfluid at low and high @xmath1 .",
    "meridional streamlines of the normal ( i.e. , torque generating ) component are plotted for @xmath14 and @xmath15 in figures 1a and 1b respectively .",
    "the flow is computed by integrating the hvbk equations @xcite numerically using a pseudospectral collocation method @xcite with spectral filtering to suppress high spatial frequencies , especially at high @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we adopt no - slip and no - penetration boundary conditions for the normal component ( velocity @xmath16 ) , perfect slip for the superfluid component ( i.e. , no pinning , for numerical stability ; velocity @xmath17 ) , and a stokes flow ( with @xmath18 ) initially .",
    "the mutual friction force is of the isotropic , gorter - mellink form ( @xmath19 , with @xmath20 ) @xcite , because the meridional counterflow in figures [ fig : re11]a and [ fig : re11]b excites kelvin waves via the donnelly - glaberson instability , converting the rectilinear vortex array into a vortex tangle @xcite .",
    "the superfluid component also feels a vortex tension force @xmath21 , with @xmath22 .    the meridional circulation pattern in figure [ fig : re11]b is more complicated than in figure [ fig : re11]a ; seven cells are visible for @xmath23 , compared to only one cell for @xmath14 . the azimuthally averaged differential torque @xmath24 @xcite is a monotonic function of latitude for @xmath14 but peaks near the ( moving ) secondary vortices ( at @xmath25@xmath26 ) in figure [ fig : re11]b for @xmath23 .",
    "the torque is variable at high @xmath1 , exhibiting persistent oscillations under steady differential rotation , whose amplitude depends on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : re11]c displays the torque on the outer sphere ( stellar crust ) as a function of time . for @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , after initial transients die away , we see that the torque is asymptotically steady for @xmath14 ( solid curve ) and oscillatory for @xmath23 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the variable torque leads naturally to rotational irregularities .",
    "the variability time - scale ( @xmath29 ) is too fast to account for pulsar timing noise directly .",
    "however , the torque oscillates quasiperiodically , not periodically , so @xmath30 wanders stochastically when integrated over long times [ c.f .",
    "microjumps and oscillations superimposed on a random walk ; @xcite ] .    of course",
    ", we wish to investigate the flow at @xmath31 , the realistic @xmath1 regime for radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , our simulations can not handle this . even for @xmath32 , and with heavy spectral filtering ,",
    "the flow is unresolved numerically ; the spectral coefficients do not decline monotonically with polynomial order as they should @xcite . from laboratory experiments , however , it is clear what to expect qualitatively as @xmath1 increases : the flow passes through a sequence of bifurcations to nonaxisymmetric states like herringbone waves and stuart vortices at @xmath33 @xcite , before developing fully into scale - free , kolmogorov - like turbulence at @xmath34 , which itself is not always isotropic at small scales @xcite .",
    "turbulent flow in he ii at @xmath35 often contains a vortex tangle @xcite .",
    "moreover , in experiments with he ii , eddies in the normal and superfluid components match at scales larger than the average vortex separation @xcite , implying that , macroscopically , high-@xmath1 superfluid turbulence behaves similarly to high-@xmath1 classical turbulence .",
    "hence , in neutron stars ( @xmath31 ) , the vortex tangle in the outer core may match its vorticity to the normal component .",
    "the vortex tension modifies this picture somewhat by contributing  stiffness \" in regions where @xmath36 builds up ( e.g. , at the smallest scales in the kolmogorov cascade ) .",
    "the largest eddies in fully developed turbulence , where the kinetic energy mainly resides , are nonaxisymmetric and move  jerkily \" , so the net torque fluctuates substantially .",
    "given that the reynolds number is a key factor governing the variability of the global superfluid flow in a neutron star , and hence the star s rotation , it is interesting to test whether the amplitude and rate of incidence of rotational irregularities depends on it . from the definition @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the stellar radius and",
    "@xmath39 is the kinematic viscosity of the normal component , it is clear that @xmath1 can be measured in principle , if we know how @xmath39 depends on the density @xmath40 and temperature @xmath41 in the outer core . using the newtonian viscosity formula derived by @xcite , due to neutron - neutron scattering , we find @xmath42 with @xmath43 g @xmath44 ( normal component ) and @xmath45 cm . for electron - electron scattering in a superfluid ,",
    "the multiplicative factor is @xmath46 @xcite . in writing equations ( [ eq : rey1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rey2 ] ) , we imagine a model where the outer core extends over the density range ( @xmath47@xmath48 ) @xmath49",
    "g @xmath44 , where the superfluid behaves hydrodynamically ( i.e. , weak bulk pinning ) and isotropically ( @xmath11s@xmath12-paired ) .",
    "we assume that the normal component constitutes @xmath50 % of the total density , to account for condensate depletion by nonideal effects .",
    "we do not treat stratification in the simulations to keep them tractable , although stratification is known to be important in suppressing meridional circulation @xcite .",
    "the core temperature @xmath41 is related to the surface temperature @xmath51 , e.g. , via the two - zone , heat - blanket model of @xcite , which gives @xmath52 .",
    "surface temperatures have been measured for @xmath53 neutron stars , by fitting their thermal x - ray emission to hydrogen or heavy - element atmospheres @xcite",
    ". however , the sample is too small to analyse statistically ; only three of these objects exhibit glitches , for example .",
    "instead , we are forced to estimate @xmath51 from the characteristic age @xmath54 , combined with theoretical cooling curves , calibrated against the @xmath53 objects above @xcite .",
    "we consider three cooling mechanisms : ( i ) standard neutrino cooling , via the urca and modified urca processes @xcite , ( ii ) nonstandard ( fast ) cooling due to paired neutron superfluidity @xcite , and ( iii ) nonstandard cooling with the superfluid energy gap fitted empirically to observations of thermal emission @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : re13]a displays the raw @xmath1 distributions of the @xmath2 glitching pulsars with @xmath3 yr ( green histogram ) and all @xmath4 known pulsars with @xmath3 yr ( red histogram ) , including the @xmath2 glitchers .",
    "the objects are sorted into ten bins of equal logarithmic width @xmath55 dex in the interval @xmath56 .",
    "standard cooling ( i ) and newtonian viscosity formulas are applied to both samples .",
    "we restrict attention to objects with @xmath3 yr , because the cooling curves compiled by @xcite drop away precipitiously above this age , as neutrino cooling gives way to photon cooling ( which depends sensitively on the uncertain composition of the stellar atmosphere ) .",
    "the histogram in figure [ fig : re13]a is redrawn for nonstandard cooling ( ii and iii ) in figures [ fig : re13]b and [ fig : re13]c , with bin widths of @xmath57 dex and @xmath58 dex , respectively .",
    "identical ( after rescaling @xmath1 ) distributions are obtained if the superfluid electron - electron scattering viscosity is used instead .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution of the glitching pulsars differs clearly from that of the total population .",
    "one sees immediately , from figure [ fig : re13]a , that most of the glitching pulsars have @xmath59 , whereas the pulsar population peaks at @xmath60 . to quantify this",
    ", we perform a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test on the cumulative distributions constructed from figure [ fig : re13]a ( to circumvent binning bias ) .",
    "the k - s statistic is @xmath61 , yielding a probability @xmath62 that the two populations are drawn from different distributions .",
    "similar conclusions follow for nonstandard cooling of types ii and iii , and for superfluid electron - electron scattering viscosity ( @xmath63 does not change when @xmath1 is rescaled multiplicatively ) .",
    "the associated k - s - probabilities are quoted in table [ table : t1 ] .",
    "is figure [ fig : re13 ] just a restatement of the well known trend that glitching pulsars tend to be young ?",
    "partly , but not entirely .",
    "the period distribution of glitching pulsars differs clearly from that of the total population , with a k - s probability @xmath64 .",
    "the maximum separation between the cumulative @xmath9 distributions occurs at an intermediate period @xmath65 s , ruling out a pure age effect .",
    "[ observational studies of kick velocities and pulsars in supernova remnants suggest that the distribution of the birth periods is quite flat in the range @xmath66 s ; see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . ]",
    "it appears that @xmath9 and @xmath67 control glitch behaviour independently ( perhaps , but not necessarily , through @xmath1 ) .",
    "interestingly , glitching pulsars are distributed differently in @xmath67 and @xmath1 , peaking at @xmath68 yr ( oldest objects ) and @xmath69 ( intermediate objects ) respectively .",
    "given that @xmath1 distributions of glitching and nonglitching pulsars are different , it is natural to ask whether the rate and amplitude of glitch activity are simple functions of @xmath1 .",
    "there are several possible measures of glitch activity in an individual pulsar .",
    "we pick three : ( i ) the activity parameter @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of glitches observed over a total observation time @xmath72 ( taken to be the time since discovery , in the absence of complete data ) , and @xmath73 is the accumulated change in @xmath30 due to glitches @xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath74 ; and ( iii ) the _ mean _ recurrence time @xmath75 between glitches , normalized by @xmath67 ( in @xmath53 out of @xmath2 objects , this is an upper limit , as they have glitched once only ) .",
    "interestingly , none of these measures show a clear trend with @xmath1 , leading to scatter plots .",
    "this suggests that @xmath1 controls the threshold for glitch activity , rather than its rate and amplitude , which is qualitatively consistent with ",
    "[ sec : hydro ] .",
    "for example , one can imagine a @xmath1 threshold ( when turbulence sets in ) , which must be exceeded for glitches to occur at all , and a separate  rate \" threshold ( perhaps controlled by the rossby number , proportional to the crust - core shear ) , which determines how often the pulsar glitches per unit observation time ( and hence @xmath76 ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are related physicallly to the rate at which crust - core shear builds up , which is independent of @xmath1 . also , @xmath76 is not dimensionless , so it is not surprising that factors other than @xmath1 affect it .",
    "note that @xmath1 decreases with @xmath67 but varies independently with @xmath30 , so the @xmath76-@xmath67 correlation @xcite is washed out in an @xmath76-@xmath1 plot .",
    "a superfluid ( or , indeed , a newtonian fluid ) contained in a differentially rotating , spherical shell circulates meridionally and exerts a time - dependent viscous torque on the outer shell .",
    "the vigour of the circulation , and the variability of the torque , increase with @xmath1 ; the flow is steady for @xmath79 and chaotic for @xmath35 .",
    "spherical couette flow is an idealised model of the superfluid outer core of a neutron star , in which the outer sphere is the stellar crust , which spins down electromagnetically .",
    "it is therefore interesting to test whether the incidence of pulsar rotational irregularities like glitches depends on @xmath1 .",
    "we show in  [ sec : reynolds ] that this is indeed the case : the distribution of glitching and nonglitching pulsars with @xmath3 yr is different , with k - s probability @xmath5 .",
    "this new fact joins the @xmath76-versus-@xmath67 correlation as one the few observed regularities in glitch phenomenology .",
    "an immediate worry is that the distributions in figure [ fig : re13 ] are contaminated by some observational selection effect .",
    "our estimates of @xmath1 are uncertain in two ways .",
    "first , @xmath67 is the characteristic spin - down age of the pulsar , not its true age .",
    "for example , five young pulsars with @xmath80 yr have braking index @xmath81 , whereas the formula @xmath54 assumes @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "second , the theoretical cooling curves depend sensitively on the superfluid energy gap in the outer core , which is poorly known ( although admittedly calibrated by @xmath53 pulsars with observed thermal emission )",
    ". however , the above uncertainties do _ not _ affect the conclusion that the @xmath1 distributions of the glitching and nonglitching populations in figure [ fig : re13 ] are different , because @xmath41 and hence @xmath1 are calculated in the same way for both samples .",
    "indeed , it is hard to imagine that our ability to detect glitches in radio timing data is a function of @xmath1 .    physically , the conclusions from figure [ fig : re13 ] are at once natural yet surprising .",
    "it is well known that torque variability increases with @xmath1 in a differentially rotating superfluid in laboratory and numerical experiments (  [ sec : hydro ] ) .",
    "however , it is strange that pulsars behave differently at @xmath83 ( few glitches ) and @xmath84 ( many glitches ) .",
    "naively , kolmogorov turbulence should be scale - free , fully developed , and _",
    "indistinguishable _ at these reynolds numbers .",
    "there are at least two ways to explain this .",
    "first , processes involving microscopic superfluid turbulence , e.g. , pinning @xcite and vortex tangle formation @xcite , may depend sensitively on @xmath1 in the range @xmath85 .",
    "second , it is possible that theoretical estimates of @xmath1 @xcite are @xmath86 times too high .",
    "if so , this reduces the peak of the glitching pulsar distribution to @xmath87 , exactly where spherical couette flow breaks up into nonaxisymmetric modes before becoming chaotic (  [ sec : hydro ] ) .",
    "we have no reason to doubt the @xmath39 carefully derived in the literature .",
    "however , if the flow is turbulent , reynolds stresses may completely overwhelm viscous stresses , such that @xmath39 is replaced by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 satisfies @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the mean velocity , and @xmath92 is the fluctuating velocity ( zero average ) @xcite .",
    "typically , we have @xmath93 .",
    "turbulent reynolds stresses drastically reduce @xmath1 in a range of geophysical and astrophysical applications @xcite .",
    "plainly , there exist several high-@xmath1 pulsars that do not glitch .",
    "observational selection effects aside , there exist several theoretical mechanisms that may be responsible .",
    "first , for spherical couette flow in the range @xmath94 , there are sizable intervals of @xmath1 where the flow is almost laminar , interposed between intervals where it is turbulent @xcite .",
    "second , for @xmath95 , where the turbulence is fully developed ( kolmogorov ) and  isotropic \" when averaged over a turn - over time , the torque on the star is steadier than for organised modes ( e.g. , taylor - grtler vortices ) near the onset of turbulence ( @xmath96 ) , which are not isotropic on average .",
    "third , if atmospheres and planetary interiors are any guide , the turbulent reynolds stresses depend sensitively on what nonlinear modes are excited in the turbulence , and the effective @xmath1 may vary greatly ( and unpredictably ) from object to object , in ways not captured by ( [ eq : rey2 ] ) .",
    "incidentally , none of the pulsars in our sample have low @xmath1 , even after adjusting for turbulent reynolds stresses ; the minimum is @xmath97 .",
    "hence there are no examples of low-@xmath1 objects that glitch unexpectedly .    in closing",
    ", we emphasize that the results of this paper do _ not _ prove that superfluid turbulence exists in a neutron star , let alone that it controls glitch behaviour .",
    "however , considerable effort has been expended to identify patterns in glitch behaviour , with limited success .",
    "the undeniable empirical fact that the @xmath1 distributions in figure [ fig : re13 ] are different is therefore intriguing , especially because @xmath1 is a _",
    "_ quantity with _ deep hydrodynamical significance _ , and because the k - s comparison is robust with respect to how @xmath41 , @xmath39 , and hence @xmath1 are estimated observationally .",
    "one hopes it will offer an enlightening clue to glitch physics , whether or not superfluid turbulence turns out to play a central role .",
    "we also hope that the results presented here will stimulate the ongoing observational campaign to measure pulsar temperatures .",
    "this research was supported by a postgraduate scholarship from the university of melbourne and the albert shimmins writing - up award .",
    "it makes use of the atnf pulsar catalogue http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat @xcite and unpublished glitch data provided kindly by d. lewis , m. kramer , and a. lyne ( private communications , 2005 ) .",
