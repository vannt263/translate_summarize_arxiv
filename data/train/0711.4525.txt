    "_ discrete tomography _ is concerned with the inverse problem of retrieving information about some _",
    "finite _ object from ( generally noisy ) information about its slices .",
    "an important problem is the _ reconstruction _ of a finite point set from its line sum functions in a small number of directions .",
    "more precisely , a ( _ discrete parallel _ ) _ x - ray _ of a finite subset of @xmath5 in direction @xmath3 gives the number of points in the set on each line parallel to @xmath3 . in the traditional setting , motivated by crystals , the positions to be determined form a subset of a common translate of a lattice in @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , many of the problems in discrete tomography have been studied on the square lattice ; see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite . in the longer run , by also having other structures than perfect crystals in mind , one has to take into account wider classes of sets , or at least significant deviations from the lattice structure . as an intermediate step between periodic and random ( or amorphous ) _ delone sets _ , we consider delone sets with _ long - range order _",
    ", thus including systems of _ aperiodic order _ like _ model sets _",
    "( also called _ mathematical quasicrystals _ ) as a special case .",
    "the main motivation for our interest in the discrete tomography of delone sets @xmath2 with long - range order comes from the fact that these sets serve as a rather general model of atomic positions in solid state materials together with the demand of materials science to reconstruct such three - dimensional structures or planar layers of them from their images under quantitative _ high resolution transmission electron microscopy _ ( hrtem ) .",
    "in fact , in  @xcite and  @xcite a technique is described , which , for some crystals , can effectively measure the number of atoms lying on densely occupied lines .",
    "therefore , only @xmath2-directions , i.e. , directions parallel to non - zero interpoint vectors of @xmath2 , will be considered .",
    "further , since typical objects may be damaged or even destroyed by the radiation energy after about @xmath6 to @xmath7 images taken by hrtem , one is restricted to a small number of @xmath1-rays .",
    "it actually is this restriction to _ few high - density directions _ that makes the problems of discrete tomography mathematically challenging , even if one assumes the absence of noise .",
    "since the above reconstruction problem of discrete tomography can possess rather different solutions , one is led to the _ determination _ of finite subsets of a fixed delone set @xmath2 by @xmath1-rays in a small number of suitably prescribed @xmath2-directions .",
    "more precisely , we say that the elements of a collection @xmath8 of finite sets are _ determined _ by the @xmath1-rays in a finite set of directions if different sets @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath8 can not have the same @xmath1-rays in these directions .    after summarizing a few general results on determination",
    ", we introduce the class of _ algebraic delone sets _",
    "@xmath4 ( see definition  [ algdeldef ] ) and study the determination of the _ convex subsets _ of these sets by @xmath1-rays in @xmath2-directions .",
    "they are finite subsets of @xmath2 with the property that their convex hull contains no new points of @xmath2 . by using @xmath11-adic valuation methods as introduced in discrete tomography by gardner and gritzmann in  @xcite together with standard facts from the theory of ( cyclotomic ) fields ,",
