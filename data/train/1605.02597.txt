    "spectrum management of current state - of - the - art cellular networks are designed based on the _ divide et impera _ principle . due to practical capabilities of radio transceivers , regulatory requirements , standardization , and commercial reasons",
    ", radio spectrum has been divided in chunks of certain bandwidths .",
    "for example , the spectrum is divided between operators , between radio access technologies ( e.g. , gsm , lte / a ) , between cells , and between uplink ( ul ) and downlink ( dl ) traffic ( e.g. , fdd , tdd ) .",
    "this principle may have provided a shortcut in the success of modern wireless communications , however , to support the ever increasing demands in wireless mobile data traffic , future cellular networks are required to use the limited spectrum more efficiently .    as the radio spectrum is a valuable resource ,",
    "there have been several propositions for sharing the spectrum among multiple cells and operators , which in current design paradigms are competing entities that operate in different portions of frequency bands . by allowing",
    "_ spectrum sharing _",
    "@xcite , the spectrum is more flexibly utilized which can potentially increase the overall network spectral efficiency .",
    "spectrum sharing has been considered in several aspects , e.g. , in terms of radio access ( orthogonal and non - orthogonal spectrum sharing  @xcite ) , in terms of operational range ( single operator and intra - operator spectrum sharing  @xcite ) , and in terms of priority ( primary  secondary sharing and equal priority ( co - primary ) spectrum sharing  @xcite ) .    in this paper , we study the fundamental limits of multicell non - orthogonal equal priority spectrum sharing networks . in particular , we take an _ information theoretic approach _ and model the network as an interference network with multiple base stations ( bss ) and mobile users , each bs equipped with multiple antennas and each mobile user equipped with a single antenna .",
    "indeed , there have been several approaches by modeling a spectrum sharing network as an interference channel , either in primary  secondary spectrum sharing scenarios ( in the context of cognitive radio )  @xcite or in equal priority scenarios  @xcite . in our work",
    ", we further explore this direction by considering a generalization of the interference channel to represent a _",
    "multi - cell _ network and study the degrees of freedom ( dof ) in such networks . by analyzing the sum dof",
    ", we approximately characterize the sum capacity of the considered network in the high signal - to - noise ratio regime .",
    "another important distinction in our work is that we consider multiantenna _ full - duplex ( fd ) bss_. results in  @xcite have demonstrated the feasibility of fd wireless communication by suppressing or cancelling self - interference in the rf and baseband domain . by enabling fd radio , simultaneous transmission and reception can potentially double the spectral efficiency of current half - duplex ( hd ) systems  @xcite . in an alternative view , fd can be considered as an extreme case of non - orthogonal spectrum sharing among ul and dl traffic . in this sense ,",
    "our work studies two spectrum sharing concepts in a single comprehensive framework .",
    "the main challenge in this direction is to deal with _ interference _ caused by several coexisting entities and simultaneous non - orthogonal transmissions among them .",
    "this involves sufficient treatment of inter - cell interference , intra - cell interference , and additionally , interference caused by ul and dl transmissions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a theoretical framework for understanding the dof in fd multicell spectrum sharing networks and help understand the overall system improvement by unlocking the spectrum barriers .      to deal with the additional interference caused by spectrum sharing among multiple cells and fd",
    ", we propose signal space _ interference alignment _",
    "( ia ) strategies that are optimized for multicell fd networks .",
    "the pioneering work of maddah - ali , motahari , and khandani  @xcite and cadambe and jafar  @xcite introduced ia as an effective coding technique that efficiently deals with interference .",
    "in particular , ia has been shown to achieve the optimal dof for various interference networks  @xcite .    when applied to _ cellular networks _ , it was shown that ia can be successfully applied to mitigate interference in a two - cell network  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this approach , the work of  @xcite proposed an ia strategy for a spectrum sharing multicell network with dynamic ul  dl configuration and showed that it attains the optimal dof . following this line of work ,",
    "we have previously studied and characterized the optimal dof of a _ single cell _",
    "network that consists of a fd bs and , either , hd mobile users or fd mobile users  @xcite . the dof improvement achievable by fd operation at bss has been also studied in the context of blind ia techniques using reconfigurable antennas @xcite and linear beamforming techniques for multiple - input and multiple - output ( mimo ) environment @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the ul data is sent to the bs using ia such that user - to - user interference is confined within a tolerated number of signal dimensions , while the bs transmits in the remaining signal dimensions via zero - forcing beamforming for the dl transmission .",
    "this work is a follow - up work on  @xcite by further extending the network to a spectrum shared network , i.e. , a multicell configuration .",
    "compared to single - cell cellular networks ( where cells are assumed to operate in different frequency bands ) , multicell spectrum sharing inherents additional interference from cells that share the same spectrum .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether spectrum sharing among multiple cells will provide some gain over a cellular network with cells that operate in separately dedicated bands .",
    "assuming @xmath0 is the number of cells that share the same spectrum , what is the dof of this network ?",
    "how does the dof behave with respect to @xmath0 ?    to answer these questions , we propose a novel strategy based on ia which takes into account inter - cell interference , intra - cell interference , as well as interference caused by fd .",
    "the key idea of our proposed scheme is to minimize the dimension of ul inter - cell and user - to - user interferences via ia beamforming at ul users , and at the same time , to align or null out dl intra - cell and inter - cell interferences , as well as bs - to - bs interference via ia beamforming or zero - forcing beamforming at bss . in the proposed strategy",
    ", each bs employs ia beamforming when the number of antennas at each bs is small while zero - forcing beamforming is used otherwise .",
    "the dof performance of this strategy is stated in theorem  [ thm : dof_1 ] .",
    "furthermore , we also derive an upper bound on the sum dof ( theorem  [ thm : dof_2 ] ) , which is tight under certain conditions .",
    "these results demonstrate how spectrum sharing and fd can provide significant throughput improvement over conventional cellular networks , especially for a network with large number of users and/or cells .",
    "these gains are highlighted in examples  [ ex : ex1 ] and [ ex : ex2 ] in section  [ sec : main - results ] .",
    "starting with the next section , we describe the network model and the sum dof metric considered in this paper . in section  [ sec : main - results ] , we present the main results of the paper and intuitively explain how multicell non - orthogonal spectrum sharing and fd operation can increase the overall dof . in section  [ sec : achievability ]",
    "we provide the achievability proof of theorem  [ thm : dof_1 ]",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we briefly discuss about the impacts of bs - to - bs interference and self - interference on dof .",

    ", we additionally need to take into account for inter - cell interferences from multicell spectrum sharing and ul - to - dl interferences from fd .",
    "a novel interference management scheme has been proposed for mitigating all different types of intra - cell , inter - cell , user - to - use , and bs - to - bs interferences and the corresponding achievable dof has been established for a general network configuration with respect to the number of antennas at each bs , the number of cells , and the number of users in each cell . for the converse part , we also derived an upper bound on the sum dof , which is tight under certain conditions .",
    "the results show significant throughput improvement over conventional cellular networks , thereby providing theoretical evidence of performance improvement by jointly utilization of spectrum sharing and fd .",
    "our work can be extended to several interesting further directions .",
    "for example , regarding csi , we may consider the case in which the channel state information at the transmitters ( csit ) is delayed or partially known in order to show whether spectrum sharing and fd can still increase the system throughput and how the dof of the multicell fd network behaves in the lack of csi .",
