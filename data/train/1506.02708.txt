    "classical chaos is characterized by the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in a deterministic dynamical system @xcite . in a conservative hamiltonian system , this occurs for trajectories which do not settle down to fixed points , periodic orbits , or quasi - periodic orbits in the limit @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the time of evolution of the trajectory @xcite .",
    "sensitive dependence on initial conditions means that nearby trajectories separate exponentially fast ; the rate of separation is given by the lyapunov exponent , @xmath2 , which characterizes the dynamics of the system . a conservative hamiltonian system with @xmath3 degrees of freedom , with @xmath3 constants of motion",
    ", it is said to be integrable , and its dynamics is regular .",
    "when there are fewer than @xmath3 constants of motion , then the individual trajectories can explore the phase space in a complex manner and the system can exhibit chaos .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the above  definition \" of chaos fails in the quantum domain .",
    "a quantum state is not a point in the phase space but is described by a state vector .",
    "the time evolution of the state vector , due to the schr@xmath4dinger s equation , is unitary .",
    "this means that the overlap of two state vectors undergoing evolution is _ constant _ with time .",
    "therefore , quantum systems , unlike their classically chaotic counterparts , do not show a sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , while classical chaos can lead to infinitely fine structures in the phase space , in quantum mechanics , planck s constant , @xmath5 , sets the scale for such structures , according to heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "this is often stated as the key reason for the absence of chaos in the quantum domain .",
    "this , however , is not the complete story . an alternate description of classical mechanics , involving the evolution of classical probability densities , preserves the distance between two probability densities as a function of time @xcite .",
    "hence , the distance between two probability densities does not show exponential sensitivity even for classical mechanics .",
    "all this leads to two interesting questions :    1 .   how does classically chaotic dynamics inform us about certain properties of quantum systems , e.g. , the energy spectrum , nature of eigenstates , correlation functions , and more recently , entanglement and quantum discord",
    "alternatively , what features of quantum systems arise due to the fact that their classical description is chaotic ? 2 .   since all systems are fundamentally quantum mechanical , how does classical chaos , with trajectories sensitive to initial conditions , arise out of the underlying quantum equations of motion ?",
    "these two questions are not unrelated .",
    "however , the first question deals mainly with finding the signatures of chaos by studying the properties of the quantum hamiltonian , while the second concerns with the dynamical behaviour of quantum states and the emergence of classically chaotic behaviour in the macroscopic limit .",
    "a central result of quantum chaos is its relationship to the theory of random matrices @xcite . in the limit of large hilbert space dimensions ( small @xmath5 ) , for parameters such that the classical description of the dynamics shows global chaos , the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the quantum dynamics have the statistical properties of an ensemble of random matrices .",
    "the appropriate ensemble depends on the properties of the quantum system under time - reversal @xcite .",
    "the ensemble of random matrices used to describe the hamiltonians unrestricted by the time reversal symmetry is the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "similarly , the ensemble of random matrices used to describe the hamiltonians having a time reversal symmetry are given by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "the other class of random matrices typically studied are the random unitary matrices .",
    "they are employed for periodically driven systems , as models of the unitary  floquet \" operators , @xmath6 , describing the change of the quantum state during one cycle of the driving .",
    "powers of the  floquet \" operator , @xmath7 , give us a stroboscopic description of the dynamics .",
    "the ensemble of random unitaries are also known as the  circular ensembles \" , originally introduced by dyson @xcite . as was the case for random hermitian matrices ,",
    "time reversal symmetry arguments play a similar role in the choice of the appropriate ensemble of random unitaries employed to model the ",
    "floquet \" operator to study the properties of the chaotic system . depending on whether the system has time reversal symmetry or not , the appropriate ensemble of random unitaries is called the circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe ) or the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) respectively .",
    "the eigenvectors of the coe and cue have the same properties as that for the respective goe and gue , but the eigenvalues are distributed differently .",
    "the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) is just the ensemble of random unitary matrices picked from @xmath8 according to the haar measure .",
    "cue eigenvalues lie on the unit circle in the complex plane , and hence the name .    from this fact , an important quantum signature of chaos",
    "was obtained by bohigas and collaborators @xcite , describing the spectral statistics of quantum hamiltonians whose classical counterparts exhibit complete chaos using random matrix theory .",
    "such signatures of quantum chaos have mainly focussed on the time - independent schr@xmath4dinger s equation and features like energy spectra and eigenstates .",
    "though quantum systems show no exponential separation under the evolution of a known unitary evolution , they do show a sensitivity to the parameters in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "peres @xcite showed that the evolution of a quantum state is altered when a small perturbation is added to the hamiltonian .",
    "as time progresses , the overlap of the perturbed and unperturbed states gives an indication of the stability of quantum motion .",
    "it was shown that if a quantum system has a classically chaotic analog , this overlap has a very small value .",
    "on the other hand , if the classical analog is regular , the overlap remains appreciable .",
    "in another perspective , as seen in the work of schack and caves , quantum systems exhibit chaos when they are perturbed by the environment .",
    "they become hypersensitive to perturbations @xcite , as seen in the information - theoretic studies of the cost to maintain low entropy in the face of loss of information to the environment .",
    "this particular feature of quantum chaotic systems has several interesting consequences .",
    "for example , shepelyansky has done extensive work on the issue of many - body quantum chaos in the quantum computer hardware and its effect on the accuracy of quantum computation @xcite in the absence of error correction . recently",
    ", classical simulations of quantum dynamics have been connected to integrability and chaos @xcite .",
    "it is imperative to mention the role played by quantum information theory in the above journey .",
    "quantum information science has added a whole new perspective to the study of quantum mechanics .",
    "this has resulted in a better understanding of quantum phenomena like entanglement and decoherence , and given us the tools to view certain quantum properties of physical systems as a resource .",
    "this has also enabled us to address the key questions in quantum chaos from a new perspective . as mentioned above ,",
    "this has led to an information theoretic characterization of quantum chaos @xcite and explained the exploration of the behavior of chaotic quantum systems in the presence of environment induced decoherence @xcite along with its connection to the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "the study of quantum chaos from a quantum information perspective is also closely related to the theory and application of random quantum circuits @xcite . in the last two decades",
    ", quantum information theory has given us a new perspective in finding the fingerprints of chaos in quantum mechanics .",
    "the dynamical generation of entanglement and discord and information gain in tomography have been studied as signatures of classical chaos in the quantum world @xcite .    in @xcite , it was shown that information gain about an initial quantum state in the process of quantum tomography is a metric to characterize and quantify quantum chaos . in this work",
    ", we review this new information - theoretic characterization of chaos and show how this procedure can be used to distinguish between symmetry classes of various quantum maps .",
    "quantum tomography is the process of estimating an unknown quantum state from the statistics of measurements made on many copies of the state . in this work ,",
    "we extend our efforts on information gain in quantum tomography to characterize the properties of the underlying dynamics .",
    "in particular , we give new analytical results for the information gain for different classes of quantum maps depending on their time reversal and parity symmetry properties .",
    "the standard way to perform quantum tomography is to make projective measurements of an  informationally complete \" set of observables and repeat them many times .",
    "the statistics obtained are used to estimate the expectation values of the observables and hence the unknown initial state .",
    "projective measurements pose a hurdle in exploring the connections between information gain in tomography and chaos due to large measurement back - action on the system .",
    "however , we overcome this by employing the protocol for tomography via weak continuous measurement developed by silberfarb et al .",
    "@xcite . in this protocol , the ensemble is collectively controlled and probed in a time dependent manner to obtain an  informationally complete \" continuous measurement record .",
    "we consider the case of a very weak measurement such that the back - action is negligible .",
    "this is possible when the uncertainty in any measurement outcome is small compared to the quantum uncertainty associated with the probe itself .",
    "we accurately model all of the quantum dynamics occurring in the system , and then use the measurement time history to give us information about the initial quantum state .",
    "the dynamics is  informationally complete \" if the time history contains information about an arbitrary initial condition .",
    "our goal is to characterize and quantify the performance of tomography , when the dynamics driving the system are chaotic in the classical limit .",
    "we use this to draw connections between the role played by regular and chaotic dynamics as well as the nature of symmetries of the dynamics in the tomography procedure . the work presented in this paper is intimately related to the protocols that have recently been implemented in the laboratory @xcite .",

    "@xmath9 , we review the protocol for tomography via weak continuous measurement developed by silberfarb et al .",
    "@xcite and riofro et al .",
    "@xcite . in section @xmath10 , we demonstrate how information gain while performing tomography is a quantum signature of classical chaos .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of the reconstruction fidelity and its relationship to the degree of chaos in the dynamics that drive the system .",
    "we also show how the fidelity obtained and the corresponding metrics to quantify information gain can be used to distinguish quantum maps belonging to different symmetry classes .",
    "we then explain these results in terms of the properties of random states in hilbert space .",
    "our results are discussed and summarized in sec . @xmath11 .",
    "in this section , we review tomography via a continuous measurement protocol . consider an ensemble of @xmath3 , noninteracting , simultaneously prepared quantum systems in an identical , but unknown , state described by the density matrix @xmath12 .",

    "the ensemble is collectively controlled and probed in a time - dependent manner to obtain an  informationally complete \" continuous measurement record . in order to achieve informational completeness ,",
    "when viewed in the heisenberg picture , the set of measured observables should span an operator basis for @xmath12 . for a hilbert space of finite dimension @xmath14 , and fixing the normalization of @xmath12 , the set of hermitian operators must form a basis of @xmath15 .",
    "the measurement record is inverted to get an estimate of the unknown state .",
    "laboratory realization of such a record is intimately tied to _",
    "controllability _ ,",
    "i.e. , designing the system evolution is such a way as to generate arbitrary unitary maps .",
    "while it is desirable to obtain an informationally complete measurement record , we shall see that we can obtain high fidelity in tomography in some cases even when this is not the case  @xcite .    in an idealized form ,",
    "the probe performs a qnd measurement that couples uniformly to the _ collective variable _ across the ensemble and measures @xmath16 . for a strong qnd measurement",
    ", quantum backaction will result in substantial entanglement among the particles .",
    "for a sufficiently weak measurement , the noise on the detector ( e.g. , shot noise of a laser probe ) dominates the quantum fluctuation intrinsic to the measurement outcomes of the state ( projection noise ) . in this case",
    ", we can neglect the backaction on the quantum state and the ensemble remains factorized . in order to obtain a measurement record that can be inverted to reconstruct an estimate of the initial state ,",
    "one must drive the system by a carefully designed dynamical evolution that continually maps new information onto the measured observable . in order to do so , the system is manipulated by external fields .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath17 $ ] , is a functional of a set of time dependent control functions , @xmath18 , so that the dynamics produces an informationally complete measurement record @xmath19 .",
    "then we can write the measurement record obtained as    @xmath20    amplified by the total number of copies ( @xmath3 atoms in this case ) . here",
    "@xmath21 is a gaussian - random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath22 , which accounts for the noise on the detector .",

    "1 ) * the quantum kicked top * : in our system , we have a symmetry given by the parity operator @xmath137 that has the form @xmath138 our unitary map , @xmath69 , being the kicked top or the appropriate coe sampled matrix , will commute with @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath139 = 0 $ ] .",
    "thus , there exists a basis in which @xmath69 and @xmath137 are diagonal .",
    "first , note that the eigenvalues of @xmath137 are @xmath140 .",
    "then , let s define a basis , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 for @xmath143 , and @xmath144 for @xmath145 , corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and where @xmath148 .",
    "since @xmath69 is also diagonal in this basis , an asymptotic approximation to the inverse of the covariance matrix is @xmath149 . \\end{split}\\ ] ] our initial observable , @xmath150 , anti - commutes with @xmath137 , meaning that @xmath151 because of this , we see that @xmath152 and @xmath153 as discussed above in eq .",
    "[ eq : traceinvc ] , we know that after time @xmath123 , the trace of the inverse covariance matrix is given by @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is a constant independent of the floquet map , @xmath156 , driving the system .    thus , the matrix representation of @xmath88 in the ordered basis in which @xmath137 is diagonal is _ anti - block diagonal_. we immediately see that eq . [ riomain ] simplifies to @xmath157.\\ ] ] in this basis , @xmath158 is approximately diagonal .",
    "so we can actually give an analytical formula for the shannon entropy .",
    "remember that we previously defined the normalization factor as @xmath159 .",
    "so the eigenvalues of @xmath158 are simply @xmath160 . to compute the expected value of the shannon entropy",
    ", we use the results of wootters @xcite for the expected value of entropy of the entries of a state expressed in a random basis , and sampled from the appropriate ensemble .",
    "we see that since @xmath88 is anti block diagonal , there are only @xmath161 nonzero terms .",
    "now , we can directly use wootters formula for the expected shannon entropy , @xmath162 for @xmath163 , we get @xmath164 .",
    "numerically , we find a somewhat larger value for the kicked top , @xmath165 and @xmath166 for entropy averaged over 100 block diagonal coe matrices .",
    "this is due to the fluctuations in @xmath77 about the expected value and these fluctuations reduce as we increase @xmath14 and we find an excellent convergence with the analytical expression derived above .",
    "\\2 ) * the cue * : the above analysis can be carried over to a quantum map that does not have time reversal symmetry . in this case , since there is no parity symmetry , there are @xmath30 nonzero terms in eq .",
    "[ riomain ] , and therefore , we get for the expected shannon entropy as @xmath167 which agrees remarkably well with our numerical simulations ( for @xmath163 , @xmath168 ) .",
    "\\3 ) * a different haar random unitary at each time step * : in this case , we explore the complete hilbert space and we get @xmath169 , which agree very well with our simulations ( for @xmath163 , @xmath170 ) .",
    "the maximum possible value of the mutual information is attained when all eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are equal . in order to extract the maximum information about a random state",
    ", we must measure all components of the bloch vector with maximum precision . in finite time",
    ", we obtain the best estimate by dividing evenly among all observables .",
    "the missing information in deterministic chaos is the _",
    "initial condition_. a time history of a trajectory at discrete times is an archive of information about the initial conditions given perfect knowledge about the dynamics .",
    "moreover , if the dynamics is chaotic the rate at which we learn information increases due to the rapid lyapunov divergence of distinguishable trajectories and we expect unbiased information because of the ergodic mixing of phase space .",
    "that is , if the information is generated by chaotic dynamics , the trajectory is random , and all initial conditions are equally likely until we invert the data and discover the initial state .",
    "dynamics sensitive to the initial conditions will reveal more information about the initial conditions as one observes the system trajectory in the course of time .",
    "classically chaotic dynamics generates this unpredictability , or information to be gained about the initial coordinates of the trajectory .",
    "similarly , we found that the rate at which one obtains information about an initially unknown quantum state in quantum tomography is correlated with the extent of chaos in the system .",
    "this is a new quantum signature of classical chaos .",
    "in fact , our results can be regarded as signatures of chaos in quantum systems undergoing unitary evolution , as measurement backaction is negligible .",
    "we have been able to quantify the information gain using the fi associated with estimating the parameters of the unknown quantum state .",
    "when the system is fully chaotic , the rate of information gain agrees with the predictions of random matrix theory .    at its core ,",
    "our approach is akin to the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy measure of chaos @xcite .",
    "incomplete information about the initial condition leads to unpredictability of a time history . in the presence of classical chaos , in order to predict which coarse - grained cell in phase space a trajectory will land at a later time , we require an exponentially increasing fine - grained knowledge of the initial condition . the ks entropy is the rate of increase , and is related to the positive lyapunov exponents of the system .",
    "is there a meaningful quantum definition of ks entropy ?",
    "our results seem to suggest this . in order to predict the measurement record with a fixed uncertainty , we need to learn more and more about the initial condition .",
    "is the rate at which we obtain this information exponentially fast when the system is quantum chaotic ?",
    "does this converge to the classical lyapunov exponents in the limit of large action ( small @xmath5 ) ?",
    "there are many important subtleties in these questions .",
    "as we gain more and more information , eventually quantum backaction becomes important in the measurement history .",
    "the number of copies we have and the shot noise on the probe limits the ultimate resolution with which we can deduce the quantum state @xcite . unlike classical dynamics , we can never consider infinite resolution , even in principle .",
    "the quantum resolution is limited by the size of @xmath5 . as the dimension of the hilbert space increases , and hence the effective @xmath5 decreases",
    ", we expect to see an even sharper difference in the information gain as a function of chaoticity . in the limit",
    "when @xmath14 , the dimension of the hilbert space , becomes infinity , we expect the rate of information gain to be intimately related to the classical lyapunov exponents .",
    "how all this translates into a quantum definition of ks entropy is an important subject of further investigation .    in principle",
    "we never have perfect knowledge of the dynamics .",
    "this is related to hypersensitivity to perturbations@xcite in quantum chaotic dynamics .",
    "this implies that , though quantum systems show no sensitivity to initial conditions , due to unitarity , they do show a sensitivity to parameters in the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "how does this fundamentally limit our ability to perform quantum state reconstruction when the system is sufficiently complex , and the equivalent dynamics is chaotic .",
    "this poses interesting questions for quantum tomography and , more interestingly , for quantum simulations . under",
    "what conditions are the system dynamics sensitive to perturbations and how does this effect our ability to perform quantum tomography ?",
    "under what conditions does the underlying quantum chaos affect our ability to accomplish quantum simulations in general ?",
