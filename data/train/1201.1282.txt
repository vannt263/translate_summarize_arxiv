    "they evaluated the impact of impurities in the optical catalog as well as scatter in the mass - richness relations and concluded that neither could account for the observed discrepancy individually . here , we broaden the @xcite analysis to include the _ uncertainties in the mass calibrations _ as well as the _ combined systematic effects _ in optical cluster catalogs . instead of two model predictions to compare against the data , we look at the family of predictions which come from uncertainties in the calibrations and the ranges of systematics in optical cluster catalogs .    there are numerous systematic effects in optical galaxy cluster catalogs .",
    "these include the cluster selection ( as a function of mass @xmath8 and redshift @xmath9 ) which comprises : _ completeness_ the probability that a true halo will be detected ; and _",

    "our simulation pipeline does not create correlated scatters in the observables at fixed mass .",

    "gray dotted lines show more general models , while the blue lines in the bottom panel are specific to the maxbcg / mcxc sub - sample .",
    "the error bars are the planck data .",
    "uncertainty in the mass calibration is the dominant effect on the model predictions , however impurity and mis - centering both bias the model predictions towards lower values of @xmath48 . on the other hand , x - ray luminosity selected sub - samples ( e.g. , the mcxc ) show highly biased @xmath48 predicted values ( compared to a perfect optical catalog ) .",
    "see figures [ fig : maxbcg_and_planck ] and [ fig : maxbcg_and_mcxc ] for the combined effects of these systematics.,width=321,height=400 ]    in figure [ fig : systematics ] , we compare the stacked @xmath48 in our family of mock cluster catalogs to a `` perfect '' cluster catalog that has been calibrated according to @xcite .",
    "the `` perfect '' catalog uses a single calibration and does not contain any of the systematics we discuss in section [ opticalsimsection ] .",
    "this is identical to the model the planck team used to compare to the data @xcite . in each panel ,",

    "dotted - lines show more general models ( e.g. , 70% purity independent of mass ) .",
    "we also show the planck data presented in @xcite .",
    "we do not show redshift scatter and completeness since we found them to have negligible effects at maxbcg levels .",
    "systematic uncertainties ( 2@xmath34 ) in the mass - richness calibration result in up to 50% range in the model @xmath48 measurements .",
    "this is because the @xmath48 values from our perfect catalog are calculated from a single mass calibration , while the model @xmath48s are calculated using the masses drawn from the calibration including 1 and 2 @xmath34 uncertainties .",
    "mis - centering suppresses ( biases low ) the model @xmath48s over the entire mass range , with the largest effect at low mass ( @xmath50 25% suppression ) .",
    "this can be understood from the convolution of the planck beam ( @xmath50 7 full width at half of maximum ) and the centering offsets which are on average @xmath50 3 at the median redshift of the optical sample .",
    "the offsets are large compared to the planck beam , which blurs out the sz - signal after the convolution .",
    "the impact of this effect increases to @xmath60 at low mass , since the maxbcg mis - centering fraction is mass dependent .",
    "impurities suppress ( biases low ) the amplitude of the model @xmath48s by introducing pure noise into the sz maps . as also noted by @xcite , high levels of impurity",
    "would be required to explain the discrepancy with the data .",
    "just as important , the weak - lensing calibration of the mass - richness relation would also be affected by large impurities which would lead to an enhancement in the mass - richness relation . since @xmath61 ,",
    "high impurities could even cause the observed sz signal to be enhanced compared to the systematics - free case ( something neither we nor planck detect ) .",
    "accurate modeling of the impact of impurities on @xmath48 requires simulating its effect on the weak - lensing calibration of the optical catalog .",
    "the stated uncertainty in mass scatter @xcite does not have a significant impact on the sz signal recovered using a maxbcg - like catalog ( see the gray band in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : systematics ] ) .",
    "however , the same can not be said for the mcxc - like subsample ( blue lines in the same panel and see section [ sec : mcxcsim ] ) .",
    "the x - ray selection causes a malmquist bias in low richness bins where the x - ray sub - sample preferentially contains brighter ( and thus more massive ) clusters .",
    "figure [ fig : lx_ysz_corr ] illustrates that selecting clusters above some @xmath51 limit ( like the example shown by the gray line ) preferentially selects clusters with high @xmath48 .",
    "larger mass scatter increases the correlation between @xmath51 and @xmath48 and therefore enhances the malmquist bias .",
    "richness bins that lie completely to the right of the @xmath51 limit are not affected by this bias and so the sz signal there is not enhanced .      .",
    "the naive perfect model predicts higher ( on average ) @xmath48 values compared to the models which include catalog systematics .",

    "the planck data ( error bars ) are the same in both panels from @xcite .",
    "the solid blue lines shows the single naive perfect model based on either the  ( left ) or  ( right ) mass calibration in the absence of systematics @xcite .",
    "the gray bands show model predictions based on our monte - carlo mock cluster catalog realizations which include all of the maxbcg optical catalog properties , uncertainties , and systematics shown in figure [ fig : systematics ] and which were applied in the original weak - lensing richness mass calibrations . while the planck data are statistically inconsistent with the naive perfect model prediction , they lie at the lower edge of the models which include the @xmath501 @xmath34 systematic uncertainties for the  mass calibration .      .",
    "while the perfect model is the same as in figure [ fig : maxbcg_and_planck ] , the gray bands here include the bias seen in figure [ fig : systematics ] ( bottom ) , which is caused after sub - sampling clusters based on their x - ray luminosities to match the observed data .",
    "the naive perfect model predicts lower ( on average ) @xmath48 values compared to the models which include catalog systematics .",

    "the gray bands here include simulated optical and x - ray systematics as well as the x - ray selection function . as expected from figure [ fig : systematics]-bottom",
    ", we see a bias in the predicted @xmath48 with decreasing richness due to the malmquist bias present in low richness bins after only the brightest @xmath51 are selected ( see figure [ fig : lx_ysz_corr ] ) .",
    "the planck observations lie inside the lower edge of the models which include the 1 and @xmath62 systematic uncertainties for  and  mass calibrations respectively .",
    "the planck team reported that the stacked sz signal around optical clusters lies well below the single model expectation which does not include the optical catalog systematic uncertainties . on the other - hand , they find that the observed stacked @xmath48 values around an x - ray limited sub - sample are consistent with the naive optical model .",
    "they concluded that the gas properties of clusters appear to be more stably related to each other than the gas - to - optical properties of clusters @xcite . in this work",
    ", we reach a fundamentally different conclusion : the @xmath48 values observed by planck are consistent with the model predictions for both the entire cluster sample and the x - ray sub - sample to within the 1 @xmath34 optical systematic uncertainties of the @xcite mass calibration . not only",
    "do we argue that there is no significant discrepancy between the models and the observed planck stacked @xmath48 values around optical clusters , but we also argue that the optical and x - ray selected sub - samples simultaneously agree with model predictions . for instance , we can apply a single mass - richness calibration to the data and fit the predicted @xmath48 models in figures [ fig : maxbcg_and_planck ] and [ fig : maxbcg_and_mcxc ] simultaneously .",
    "however we do not pursue a joint sz - optical mass calibration here , as it beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we find that the dominant source of optical systematic uncertainty comes from the mass calibration , which alone can account for most of the original discrepancy noted by @xcite .",
    "impurities and centering errors combine to bias the model predictions towards lower @xmath48 for the optical samples while mass scatter biases the predictions high for low richness systems in the x - ray limited subsample .",
    "when fully accounted for , these systematics allow for models which are matched by the observed data for both the optical and x - ray cluster sub - samples in the planck data .",
    "the range on the acceptable models is quite large and we note that the sz - optical scaling laws can not by precisely characterized using this type of stacking until the optical systematics improve ( specifically mass calibration and its scatter ) .",
    "this work highlights the importance of multi - wavelength studies of cluster properties as a source of cross - checks and a calibration .",
    "it is clear that optical systematics can not be ignored and future analysis of stacked clusters should be done using monte carlo analysis to include a larger suite of systematic errors .",
