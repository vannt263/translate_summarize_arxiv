    "in the year 1837 gabriel lam presented @xcite results of his studies on distribution of temperature in a homogeneous solid body in thermal equilibrium .",
    "he was interested , in particular , in description of the _ isothermic surfaces _ , i.e. surfaces of constant temperature within the body ; notice that his definition makes sense only for families of surfaces , and not for a single surface .",
    "then he found a condition under which one parameter family of surfaces in ( a subset of ) @xmath0 consists of isothermic surfaces , and showed ( for details see @xcite or  @xcite ) that the three families of confocal quadrics , which provide elliptic coordinates in @xmath0 , meet that criterion .",
    "subsequently , he proposed to determine all triply orthogonal systems composed by three isothermic families ( triply isothermic systems ) .",
    "such a program was fulfiled by gaston darboux  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another path of research was initiated by joseph bertrand  @xcite who showed that the surfaces of triply isothermic systems are divided by their lines of curvature into `` infinitesimal squares '' , or in exact terms , they allow for conformal curvature parametrization .",
    "this definition of isothermic surfaces ( or surfaces of isothermic curvature lines ) , which can be applied to a single surface , was commonly accepted in the second half of the xix - th century ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we mention that the minimal surfaces and the constant mean curvature surfaces are particular examples of the isothermic surfaces .",
    "the theory of isothermic surfaces was one of the most favorite subjects of study among prominent geometers of that period .",
    "such surfaces exhibit particular properties , for example there exists a transformation , described by gaston darboux in  @xcite , which produces from a given isothermic surface a family of new surfaces of the same type .",
    "the gauss - mainardi - codazzi equations for isothermic surfaces constitute a nonlinear system generalizing the @xmath1-gordon equation ( the latter governs the constant mean curvature surfaces ) , and the darboux transformation can be interpreted as bcklund - type transformation of the system .",
    "soon after that luigi bianchi showed  @xcite that two darboux transforms of a given isothermic surface determine _ in algebraic terms _ new isothermic surface being their simultaneous darboux transform .",
    "the bianchi permutability principle can be considered as a hallmark of integrability ( in the sense of soliton theory ) of the above - mentioned system .",
    "indeed , the isothermic surfaces were reinterpreted by cieliski , goldstein and sym @xcite within the theory of soliton surfaces  @xcite . more information on isothermic surfaces and their history the reader can find in the paper of klimczewski , nieszporski and sym @xcite , where also a more detailed description of the relation between the `` ancient '' differential geometry and the soliton theory is given , and in books by rogers and schief @xcite and by hertrich - jeromin @xcite .",
    "in the recent studies of the relation between geometry and the integrable systems theory a particular attention is payed to discrete ( difference ) integrable equations and the corresponding discrete surfaces or lattice submanifolds . also here",
    "the discrete analogs of isothermic surfaces played a prominent role in the development of the subject .",
    "bobenko and pinkall @xcite introduced the integrable discrete analogoue of isothermic surfaces as mappings built of `` conformal squares '' , i.e. , maps @xmath2 with all elementary quadrilaterals circular , and such that the complex cross - ratios ( with the plane of a quadrilateral identified with the complex plane @xmath3 ) @xmath4 are equal to @xmath5 . soon after that it turned out @xcite that it is more convenient to allow for the cross - rations to satisfy the constraint @xmath6 then the cross - ratio is a ratio of functions of single variables , which corresponds to allowed reparametrization of the curvature coordinates on isothermic surfaces .",
    "after the pioneering work of bobenko and pinkall , which was an important step in building the geometric approach to integrable discrete equations ( see also @xcite and older results of the difference geometry ( _ differenzengeometrie _ ) summarized in robert sauer s books @xcite ) , the discrete isothermic surfaces and their darboux transformations were studied in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "distinguished integrable reductions of isothermic lattices are the discrete constant mean curvature surfaces or the discrete minimal surfaces @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the complex cross - ratio condition was extended to circular lattices of dimension three @xcite placing the darboux transformations of the discrete isothermic surfaces on equal footing with the lattice itself .    in the present - day approach to the relation between discrete integrable systems and geometry @xcite the key role",
    "is played by the integrable discrete analogue of conjugate nets ",
    "multidimensional lattices of planar quadrilaterals ( the quadrilateral lattices ) @xcite .",
    "these are maps @xmath7 of @xmath8-dimensional integer lattice in @xmath9-dimensional projective space with all elementary quadrilaterals planar .",
    "integrability of such lattices ( for @xmath10 ) is based on the following elementary geometry fact ( see figure  [ fig : titjtkx ] ) .",
    "[ lem : gen - hex ] consider points @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in general position in @xmath15 , @xmath16 . on the plane @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 choose a point @xmath19 not on the lines @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "then there exists the unique point @xmath23 which belongs simultaneously to the three planes @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "various constraints compatible with the geometric integrability scheme define integrable reductions of the quadrilateral lattice .",
    "it turns out that such geometric notion of integrability very often associates integrable reductions of the quadrilateral lattice with classical theorems of incidence geometry .",
    "we advocate this point of view in the present paper .    among basic reductions of the quadrilateral lattice the so called quadratic reductions @xcite play a distinguished role .",
    "the lattice vertices are then contained in a hyperquadric ( or in the intersection of several of them ) .",
    "such reductions of the quadrilateral lattice can be often associated with various subgeometries of the projective geometry , when the quadric plays the role of the absolute of the geometry ( see also corresponding remarks in @xcite ) . in particular , when the hyperquadric is the mbius hypersphere one obtains , after the stereographic projection , the circular lattices @xcite , which are the integrable discrete analogue of submanifolds of @xmath27 in curvature line parametrization .",
    "because of the mbius invariance of the complex cross - ratio it is also more convenient to consider ( discrete ) isothermic surfaces in the mbius sphere ( both dimensions of the lattice and of the sphere can be enlarged ) keeping the `` cross - ratio definition '' .    for a person trained in the projective geometry",
    "it is more or less natural to generalize the mbius geometry approach to discrete isothermic surfaces ( lattices ) in quadrics replacing the mbius sphere by a quadric , and correspondingly , the complex cross - ratio by the steiner cross - ratio of four points of a conic being intersection of the quadric by the plane of elementary quadrilateral of the quadrilateral lattice .",
    "however the `` cross - ratio point of view '' does nt answer the crucial question about integrability ( understood as compatibility of the constraint with the geometric integrablity scheme ) of such discrete isothermic surfaces in quadrics .",
    "our general methodological principle in the integrable discrete geometry , applied successfuly earlier , for example in @xcite , which we would like to follow here is ( i ) to isolate basic reductions of the quadrilateral lattice and then ( ii ) to incorporate other geometric systems into the theory considering them as superpositions of the basic reductions .    in this context",
    "we would like to recall another equivalent characterization of the classical isothermic surfaces which can be found in the classical monograph of darboux  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , p. 267 ) : _ les cinq coordonnes pentasphriques dun point de toute surface isothermique considres comme fonctions des paramtres @xmath28 et @xmath29 des lignes de courbure satisfont  une quation linaire du second ordre do nt les invariants sont gaux .",

    "_    in literature there are known two ( closely related ) discrete integrable versions ( of nimmo and schief @xcite and of nieszporski @xcite ) of the moutard equation .",
    "it turns out that for our purposes it suits the discrete moutard equation proposed in  @xcite .",
    "its projectively invariant geometric characterization has been discovered @xcite only recently ( for geometric meaning of the adjoint moutard equation of nieszporski in terms of the so called koenigs lattice see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the generalized isothermic lattices can be obtained by adding to the quadratic constraint the projective moutard constraint .",
    "finally , the quadratic reduction and the moutard reduction , when applied simultaneously , give _ a posteriori _ the cross - ratio condition .    in fact , the direct algebraic discrete counterpart of the above description of the isothermic surfaces , i.e. existence of the light - cone lift which satisfies the ( discrete ) moutard equation , appeared first in a preprint by bobenko and suris @xcite .",
    "however , the pure geometric characterization of the discrete isothermic surfaces was not given there .    because integrability of the discrete moutard equation can be seen better when one considers a system of such equations for multidimensional lattices",
    ", there was a need to find the projective geometric characterization of the system .",
    "the corresponding reduction of the quadrilateral lattice was called in @xcite , because of its connection with the discrete bkp equation , the b - quadrilateral lattice ( bql ) .",
    "in fact , research in this direction prevented me from publication of the above mentioned generalization of discrete isothermic surfaces , announced however in my talk during the workshop `` geometry and integrable systems '' ( berlin , 3 - 7 june 2005 ) .",
    "i suggested also there that the discrete s - isothermic surfaces of tim hoffmann @xcite ( see also @xcite ) should be considered as an example of the generalized isothermic lattices where the quadric under consideration is the lie quadric .",
    "the final results of my research on generalized isothermic lattices were presented on the conference `` symmetries and integrability of difference equations vii '' ( melbourne , 10 - 14 july 2006 ) .",
    "when my paper was almost ready there appeared the preprint of bobenko and suris @xcite where similar ideas were presented in application to the sphere ( mbius , laguerre and lie ) geometries .",
    "i would like also to point out a recent paper by wallner and pottman @xcite devoted , among others , to discrete isothermic surfaces in the laguerre geometry .",
    "as it often happens , the logical presentation of results of a research goes in opposite direction to their chronological derivation . in section  [ sec : bql+qql ] we collect some geometric results from the theory of the b - quadrilateral lattices ( bqls ) and of quadrilateral lattices in quadrics ( qqls ) .",
    "some new results concerning the relation between ( steiner s ) cross - ratios of vertices of elementary guadrilaterals of elementary hexahedrons of the qqls are given there as well .",
    "then in section  [ sec : gen - isoth - latt ] we define generalized isothermic lattices and discuss their basic properties . in particular , we give the synthetic - geometry proof of a basic lemma ( the half - hexahedron lemma ) which immediately gives the cross - ratio characterization of the lattices .",
    "we also present some algebraic consequences ( some of them known already @xcite ) of the system of moutard equations supplemented by a quadratic constraint . in section  [ sec : darboux ] we study in more detail the darboux transformation of the generalized isothermic lattices and the corresponding bianchi permutability principle .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : isothermic ] we consider two dimensional generalized isothermic lattices . in two appendices",
    "we recall necessary information concerning the cross - ratio of four points on a conic curve and we perform some auxilliary calculations .",
    "it turns out that compatibility of both bqls and qqls with the geometric integrablity scheme follows from certain classical geometric facts .",
