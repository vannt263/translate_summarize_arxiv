    "ionic conduction through nanometer sized channels or pores is a common theme in biological systems as well as in various manufactured materials such as membranes and synthetic nanopores @xcite .",
    "theoretical as well as experimental aspects of the problem have attracted increasing interest in the past decade .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation is an effective tool for exploring these nanoscale phenomena .",
    "it has the advantage of being able to relate the observables directly to the molecular properties of the solid and liquid , once an appropriate intermolecular potential is given , without the need for too many simplifying assumptions .",
    "various aspects of the problem , such as ionic current rectification , dna translocation and water transport have already been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "md simulations in the context of translocation of single stranded and double stranded dna through biological @xmath0-hemolysin and synthetic nanopores have been reported @xcite .",
    "it was found that the open - pore current increases linearly with the applied voltage , and , obeys ohm s law for voltages that are no more than of the order of a volt .",
    "the distribution of the electric potential around the pore , the translocation speed of dna , the interactions between the dna molecule with the pore wall , as well as strategies for controlling the transolcation speed have been considered  @xcite . recently , sathe et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the translocation of dna through a graphene nanopore using md simulations , and suggested that nucleotide pairs can be discriminated using graphene nanopores under suitable bias conditions .",
    "there are , however , a number of open problems that have not been understood .",
    "first , due to the geometry of the system , the ions may accumulate and form a concentration polarization layer ( cpl ) in the vinicity of the membrane .",
    "the influence of the nonuniformity of the ion concentration in this charge separated debye layer on the ionic current has not been well understood . secondly , open questions remain on the effect of hydrodynamic flow on the ionic current as well as on dna translocation speeds .",
    "ghosal  @xcite presented a simple hydrodynamic calculation for the electrophoretic speed of the polymer , modeled locally as a long cylindrical object centered on the axis of the pore .",
    "the calculation yielded analytical results in close agreement with experimental measurements  @xcite . in a related problem where the electrophoretic force was measured with the dna immobilized in the pore , numerical  @xcite as well as analytical  @xcite models",
    "based on the hypothesis that the hydrodynamic drag was the primary resistive force yielded results in close agreement to the experiments .",
    "these results point to the possibility that hydrodynamics might play an important role in determining dna translocation speeds .",
    "hydrodynamics also plays an important role in a related problem ; when a direct current is applied across an ion - selective nanoporous membrane or through a nanochannel with overlapping debye layers , it is known , that , micro fluid vortices may be observed due to hydrodynamic instability , and these vortices are capable of enhancing the ionic current in the so called `` overlimiting regime '' @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to discuss the influence of the cpl and fluid convection on ionic transport through nanochannels using md simulations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we present the physical model and describe the numerical approach .",
    "the simulation results are analysed in detail in sec .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in sec .",
    "the molecular simulations are conducted in a cubic box with dimensions of @xmath1 nm , @xmath2 nm , @xmath3 nm . the origin of the coordinates is set in the center of the box .",
    "the graphene sheet with the size of @xmath4 , consists of an array of carbon atoms with a planar hexagonal structure ( neighboring atoms have a bond lengths of @xmath5 nm ) , localized at the mid - plane , @xmath6 .",
    "a nanopore , with radius @xmath7 , is constructed by removing the carbon atoms in a central circular patch of the graphene sheet : @xmath8 .",
    "the remainder of the box is then filled with water molecules described by the extended simple point charge ( spc / e ) model @xcite .",
    "polarization of water molecules is neglected , prior investigations have shown that this is reasonable as long as the field strength does not exceed about 10 v / nm @xcite .",
    "salt ( nacl ) is introduced at a given concentration of @xmath9 m by replacing the required number of water molecules with na@xmath10 and cl@xmath11 ions .",
    "the simulations are performed at a constant temperature 300k and pressure of 1 bar with the large scale md package gromacs 4.5.4 @xcite .",
    "the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction of the carbon atoms is modeled as uncharged lennard - jones ( lj ) particles .",
    "the graphene - water interaction is considered by a carbon - oxygen lj potential .",
    "this general set up and parameter values have been employed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "a uniform external electric field is applied in directions perpendicular to the graphene sheet ( @xmath12-direction )",
    ". the contribution of the external electric field is described as @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the charge and location of the charged atom @xmath16 respectively , and @xmath17 is the strength of the external electric field .",
    "the lj interactions are truncated at the cut - off distance @xmath18 nm and the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method @xcite with a real - space cut - off of @xmath9 nm is utilized to treat the long - range electrostatic interactions .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in all directions .",
    "the time step in all simulations is set to be @xmath19 fs .    for the sake of computational efficiency ,",
    "all of the carbon atoms are frozen during the simulations .",
    "previous investigations have shown that this only has a minor influence on the dynamics of the adjacent water .",
    "minimization of energy is performed with the steepest descent method on the initial system .",
    "then the system is evolved for @xmath19 ns to achieve a state of statistical equilibrium . in all cases ,",
    "statistics are collected during the last @xmath20 ns and samples are taken every @xmath21 ps .      to analyse the statistics of the macroscopic physical variables ,",
    "the spatial location and velocity vectors of the particles are transformed to cylindrical coordinates since averages of variables should be close to axisymmetric .",

    "the average water velocity @xmath30 in the axial direction through the nanopore is given by @xmath31 , in which @xmath32 is the mass of a water molecule , @xmath33 is water density in the bulk and @xmath34 is the area of the nanopore .    flow field .",

    "the velocity field @xmath40 of the equilibrium state is then calculated by averaging the transient velocity over time . to check the independence of physical quantities with respect to grid size , the probability density function ( pdf ) of the axial velocity @xmath41 of water at ( 0 , 0 ) is plotted in fig .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    ionic current .",
    "the ionic current is obtained by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 stands for the number of na or cl ions across the graphene nanopore in time interval @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the proton charge .",
    "if the pore size approaches zero , clearly a polarized double layer would form adjacent to the graphene sheet . for a finite , but nevertheless sufficiently small pore size , a nonuniform ion distribution ( concentration polarization )",
    "is expected adjacent to the sheet .",
    "the profiles of ionic number density along the @xmath12-axis is plotted in fig .",
    "[ ion - z ] , where @xmath6 corresponds to the graphene sheet .",
    "it is interesting that the sodium and chlorine ions both form concentration polarization layers ( cpl ) on either side of the graphene sheet .",
    "however , their distributions show some asymmetry .",
    "due to size exclusion , the ions can not approach the graphene sheet closer than about an ionic radius . the combination of electrostatic and these steric forces result in the appearance of a concentration peak . in the case of the chlorine ions ,",
    "the concentration peak is located a distance @xmath50 nm from the sheet .",
    "this distance is found to be independent of the applied field strength .",
    "the cpl can also be observed for the sodium ions on the other side ; however , the amplitude of the peak is comparatively weak . for weak applied fields ( e.g. @xmath51 v / nm )",
    "the cpl is not as well defined .",
    "a second smaller peak of sodium ions may be observed on the other side of the membrane .",
    "the asymmetry between the two kinds of ions may be partly due to the higher mobility of the chlorine ions , and , partly due to differences in the van der waals interactions between the two kinds of ions with the carbon atoms in the graphene sheet .",
    "the peak in the ionic concentration profile is found to increase monotonically with increasing electric field .    in fig .",
    "[ distribution ] , the number density of cl ions with @xmath52 v / nm and nanopore diameter @xmath53 nm is observed to exhibit a well defined peak .",
    "the nonuniformity of the ionic distribution will give rise to spatial gradients of the electric field strength near the membrane , especially in regions close to the nanopore .",
    "consequently , variations of the electric pressure is to be expected , which might drive a flow , as long as these forces are strong enough to overcome viscous resistance and are not completely masked by the fluctuating brownian forces ( thermal fluctuations ) .",
    "the formation of the cpl is expected to generate a fluid flow in the vicinity of the interface .",
    "this is indeed seen in the simulations .",
    "the flow streamlines for the nanopore of diameter @xmath53 nm , together with the distribution of water density is shown in fig . [ vel ] with different values of electric field strength . when the field is sufficiently large , e.g. , @xmath52 and @xmath54 v / nm , vortices of a spatial scale on the order of nanometers are clearly observed . when @xmath55=0.2 v / nm , the electric pressure appears too weak to generate sustained micro vortices against the influence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "an interesting physical insight that emerges from these simulations is that there appears to be a marked asymmetry in the distribution of the cations and anions and that of water density .",
    "this is most likely due to a combination of three factors .",
    "first , as we have mentioned above , there is an approximately @xmath56 percent difference in mobility between sodium and chlorine ions .",
    "second , the van der waals interactions between na and c , cl and c differ significantly .",
    "the third , which has been reported by previous researchers @xcite , is that the direction of the electric field could have significant effects on the interfacial water structures , as well as on the wetting behavior of the solid membrane , due to the polarity of the water molecules .",
    "a consequence of this asymmetry , is that there is a flux of water through the nanopore as may be seen in the appearance of the streamlines in fig .",
    "the average flow velocity @xmath30 , describing water crossing the nanopore , is presented in fig .",
    "[ flux ] for different electric field strengths and pore diameters .",

    ", the local water density can be as high as @xmath58 kg / m@xmath59 .",
    "the accumulation of water in the nanopore appears to originate from re - orientation of the water dipole moments when the external voltage is applied . to describe the orientation of water molecules , we define an average over the @xmath60-@xmath61 plane of the angle @xmath62 between the dipole moment vector of the water molecule and the @xmath12-axis . in the absence of an electric field ,",
    "the orientation of the dipoles is completely random corresponding to @xmath63 .",
    "[ dipole ] shows that with increasing electric field strengths , the dipoles prefer an axial orientation . for a given @xmath12-location ,",
    "this effect increases with the field strength .",
    "the degree of ordering also increases as one approaches the pore where the dipoles prefer to be parallel to the graphene surface .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies on swcnt where a similar ordering has been observed @xcite .",
    "such ordering allows closer packing of the water molecules leading to a rise in density in the pore region .",
    "-axis for a pore diameter of @xmath53 nm . reduction of the angle due to the re - orientation of the dipole moment by the field is strongest in the pore region where the dipoles favor to be parallel to the graphene sheet . ]",
    "recent experimental measurements have produced apparently conflicting results on the dependence of pore conductance on pore radius .",
    "garaj et al .",
    "@xcite reported that the pore conductance is proportional to the pore diameter , whereas schneider et al .",
    "@xcite reported it to be proportional to the pore area .",
    "the former result would correspond to a hole in an infinitely thin membrane in a homogeneous infinite conducting medium .",
    "the latter would correspond to a cylindrical conduit of diameter much less than the length of the cylinder @xcite . since the former result is to be expected",
    "if the thickness of graphene can be ignored and the electrolyte solution is assumed to obey ohm s law , some researchers @xcite have speculated that the discrepancy between the experiment of schneider et al . and the theoretical result for",
    "a hole in a thin sheet might originate from the fact that their graphene sheet was treated with a polymer coating ( to reduce non - specific surface adsorption of dna ) . to clarify this , sathe et al .",
    "@xcite conducted molecular dynamics simulation for a kcl solution with pore diameters in the range of @xmath64 nm . they found the dependence of resistance @xmath65 on pore diameter follows the relationship @xmath66 , which is qualitatively in agreement with the experiment of schneider et al .",
    "however , quantitatively the resistances they obtained in their simulations were three to four times smaller than the experimental measurements .",
    "they attributed the discrepancy to a number of factors including inaccuracies in the force field in their simulations , unknown charge distribution and uncertainties about the exact shape of graphene pores .",
    "the variation of the current with the applied electric field was extracted from our simulations and is shown in fig .",
    "[ current ] for a number of different pore diameters , @xmath67 .",
    "a linear regime is observed at weak fields ( @xmath55 ) . for",
    "higher applied voltages , it is found that the current shows super - linear growth and the nonlinearity is stronger for pores of smaller diameter .",
    "hydrodynamic transport due to the nanoscale vortices could be responsible for this faster than linear increase of the current .",
    "a similar phenomenon has also been observed when an external electric field is applied normal to the surface of an ion - selective nanoporous membrane immersed in an electrolyte solution . there , at a critical value of the applied field , the quiescent state undergoes a hydrodynamic instability resulting in the appearance of micro vortices that are responsible for an `` overlimiting - current '' in the current - voltage relationship @xcite . in the nanopore problem however , there is no instability .",
    "the hydrodynamic flow is always present , its strength simply increases with the electric field .",
    "[ current](b ) shows the electric conductance ( @xmath68 ) at low fields , which is calculated from the slope of the initial linear segment of the @xmath69 curves .",
    "it is seen to be proportional to the nanopore diameter @xmath67 , which is qualitatively in agreement with the experiments by garaj et al .",
    "@xcite and is as expected from the theoretical model where the pore is regarded as a hole in an infinitely thin insulating sheet in a uniform conductor .",
    "the resistance obtained for @xmath70 nm is @xmath71 m@xmath72 , which is comparable to the values reported by schneider et al @xcite , though we do not observe their @xmath73 dependence on pore diameter .",
    "the theoretical result @xmath74 for a hole of diameter ` @xmath67 ' in an insulating sheet in a conducting medium of conductivity ` @xmath43 ' may be used to extract an `` effective '' conductivity from the data shown in fig .",
    "[ current]b .",
    "the conductivity obtained in this way is @xmath75 sm@xmath76 , which is about a factor of @xmath77 smaller than the bulk conductivity , @xmath78 sm@xmath76 , for a 1 m nacl solution .",
    "the discrepancy may arise from the fact that there are significant differences between a graphene nanopore immersed in an electrolyte and a hole in an insulating sheet in an ohmic medium .",
    "as we have seen , one important difference lies in the existence of the concentration polarization layer which modifies the electric field distribution near the pore as well as drives a hydrodynamic flow that affects transport properties .",
    "the influence of these phenomena on pore conductance is still an open problem .",
    "a second source of discrepancy may be due to a limitation of our computation . in a physical experiment ,",
    "the nanopore radius is vanishingly small in comparison to the reservoir dimensions , so that essentially all of the electrical resistance arises from the pore .",
    "this assumption might not be satisfied as well in our simulated model , since , due to limitations of computational capabilities , the area of the graphene sheet that we constructed , @xmath79 , is quite comparable to the pore diameter of @xmath80 nm .",
    "these issues will be investigated further in future studies .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the transport properties of an electrolyte through a nanometer sized pore . due to",
    "the partial blockage of the ionic current by the graphene membrane , a concentration polarization layer ( cpl ) develops next to the membrane when an external voltage is applied .",
    "the cpl is able to induce electric pressure in the fluid adjacent to the pore .",
    "if the applied voltage is large enough to overcome the effects of viscosity and brownian fluctuations , vortices are generated in the fluid near the pore .",
    "these nanoscale vortices enhance the ionic current through a mechanism similar to an effect responsible for the phenomenon of `` overlimiting current '' for perm selective membranes . owing to the polarization of water molecules ,",
    "the direction of the electric field might have significant influence on water structure near the graphene surface .",
    "this effect , together with the differing mobility and van der waals attraction to c exhibited by the cl and na ions , brings about an asymmetric distribution of ions , and a net flux of water in the direction of the electric field through the pore .",
    "the average velocity of this hydrodynamic flow is found to increase approximately linearly with the electric field and appears to be independent of the pore diameter .",
    "orientational order created in the water dipoles by the electric field enhances closer packing of the water dipoles .",
    "this is manifested in the appearance of regions of high water density within the pore .",
    "the electrical conductance of the system is found to vary linearly with the nanopore diameter , as one might expect from the classical theoretical relation @xmath74 for a hole in an insulating membrane within a conductor . however , the effective conductivity , @xmath81 is found to be nearly 5 times the bulk conductivity of the electrolyte .",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath67 is in accord with the experiments of garaj et al .",
    "but we do not observe the @xmath73 dependence reported by schneider et al .",
    "this could be due to differences in experimental techniques as a result of which experimental conditions in the latter experiment do not correspond to the model studied in this paper .",
