    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are pulsar - like objects , whose x - ray luminosities are in excess of their rotational energy losses while they show no binary signature , thus acquiring the name `` anomalous '' x - ray pulsars ( mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "axps , along with soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , are candidate magnetars , neutron stars powered by strong magnetic field decay ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; paczynski 1992 ) .",
    "alternative explanations for axps and sgrs involve a normal neutron star accreting from a supernova fallback disk ( alpar 2001 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "it is then a very fundamental question to determine whether axps and sgrs are magnetars or accretion - powered systems . to finally solve this problem is not only helpful to understand the equation of state at supra - nuclear densities , but also very meaningful to explain high energy astrophysical phenomena ( xu 2007 ) .",
    "the magnetar model is prevailing in explaining bursts of axps and sgrs ( paczynski 1992 ; thomspon & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "however , bursting behavior in accretion model is not absolutely impossible ( rothschild et al .",
    "2002 ; xu et al .",
    "it is also possible that the magnetar field ( @xmath0 ) responsible for bursts is in higher multipole form while a normal dipole component ( @xmath1 ) interacts with the fallback disk ( eksi & alpar 2003 ; ertan et al .",
    "2007 ) . observations in the optical / ir band are informative , e.g. a debris disk is found around axp 4u 0142 + 61 ( wang et al .",
    "the optical / ir observation of 4u 0142 + 61 can be explained uniformly in an accretion fallback disk model ( ertan & cheng 2004 ; ertan et al .",
    "however , if the disk is passive , a fallback disk is also compitable with the magnetar scenario ( wang et al .",
    ". therefore observations at other wavelengths are very necessary to understand the real nature of axps and sgrs , especially in gamma - rays .    the outer gap model ( e.g. cheng et al .",
    "1986 ) is very successful , and high energy gamma - ray emissions of axps have been calculated and predicted by cheng & zhang ( 2001 ) in the magnetar domain , using the thick outer gap model ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) .",
    "the detailed calculations of cheng & zhang ( 2001 ) predicted that fermi / lat should be able to detect gamma - ray emission of axps , including 4u 0142 + 61 , if they are magnetars .",
    "however , a recent fermi / lat observation of 4u 0142 + 61 has been reported , which shows no detection ( sasmaz mus & gogus 2010 ) . then there seems a conflict between theory and observation . while adopting the thick outer gap model",
    "( zhang & cheng 1997 ) , simple calculations show that axps are not high energy gamma - ray emitters if they are normal neutron stars accreting from fallback disks .",
    "we suggest that fermi / lat observation of axps and sgrs can be applied to distinguish between the magnetar model and the accretion model .",
    "the non - detection of 4u 0142 + 61 may prefer the accretion model .    in  2",
    "we compare theoretical predictions from the magnetar model with fermi / lat observation of axp 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "discussions are presented in  3 .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) developed the thick outer gap model for long period pulsars .",
    "the typical lorentz factor is determined by equaling energy loss and gain .",
    "the @xmath2 pair production threshold determines the size of the outer gap self - consistently .",
    "if the x - ray photons are provided by surface thermal emission , the size of the outer gap is ( eq.(24 ) in zhang & cheng 1997 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pulsar rotation period , @xmath5 is the stellar magnetic field in units of @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the surface temperature in units of @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the stellar radius in units of @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 should be less than one for outer gap to exist . in magnetar model for axps and sgrs ,",
    "typical parameters are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the stellar radius is chosen as @xmath15 , which is moderate for realistic equations of state ( lattimer & prakash 2007 , fig 6 there ) ( in cheng & zhang 2001 , the stellar radius is chosen as @xmath16 ) .",
    "the corresponding outer gap size is then @xmath17 , which means that if axps and sgrs are magnetars they should be high energy gamma - ray emitters . on the other hand , if axps and sgrs are normal neutron stars whose ( dipolar ) magnetic fields are @xmath18 ( alpar 2001 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2000 ) , the corresponding outer gap size is @xmath19 .",
    "therefore if axps and sgrs are normal neutron stars accreting from fallback disks , they will not radiate high energy gamma - rays",
    ". thus fermi / lat observations of axps and sgrs can be helpful to distinguish between the magnetar model and the accretion model .",
    "sasmaz mus & gogus ( 2010 ) reported fermi / lat observation of axp 4u 0142 + 61 . with an exposure time of @xmath20",
    ", they find no detection of high energy gamma - ray emission from 4u 0142 + 61 in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 band .",
    "observational upper limits and theoretical calculations in the magnetar model are shown in figure 1 . for 4u",
    "0142 + 61 , its parameters are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( from the mcgill axp / sgr catalogpulsar / magnetar / main.html ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field is calculated from @xmath26 , which is 2 times larger than usually reported since the polar magnetic field is more important in the case of pulsar radiation ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "the size of the outer gap for 4u 0142 + 61 is @xmath27 .",
    "the distance @xmath28 and solid angle @xmath29 are used during the calculation . from figure 1 , the observational upper limits are below the theoretical calculations for large inclination angles ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) or when the inner boundary of outer gap can extend to 10 stellar radii ( hirotani et al . 2003 ; hirotani & shibata 2001 ) .    , @xmath30 , @xmath31 respectively ( zhang & cheng 1997 ; cheng & zhang 2001 ) . the dotdashed line takes into consideration that the inner boundary of outer gap may extend to 10 stellar radii ( hirotani et al .",
    "2003 ; hirotani & shibata 2001 ) .",
    "the empty down triangle and filled down triangle are fermi / lat upper limits ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) from @xmath32 and @xmath33 extraction region respectively ( sasmaz mus & gogus 2010 ) .",
    "the upper limits in @xmath22 are nearly coincide.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    possible reasons why fermi / lat has not seen the expected high energy gamma - rays from axp 4u 0142 + 61 are :    1 .",
    "its radius is smaller than @xmath34 ; 2 .",
    "its distance is much larger than @xmath35 ; 3 .",
    "the inclination angle is small , e.g. @xmath36 ; 4 .",
    "beaming of gamma - ray radiation ; 5 .",
    "the radiated high energy gamma - ray photons are absorbed due to internal or external matter .",
    "for order of magnitude estimations , the neutron star radius is often taken as @xmath37 . however , for realistic equations of state , this choice corresponds to a soft equation of state ( lattimer & prakash 2007 ) . for a stiff equation of state",
    "the radius can be as large as @xmath16 .",
    "a radius of @xmath34 is a moderate choice ( lattimer & prakash 2007 , fig 6 there ) .",
    "neutron star equation of state studies ( e.g. tsuruta 2006 ) also prefer medium to stiff equations of state .",
    "figure 2 shows the model calculations for axp 4u 0142 + 61 when the distance is 2 times larger , i.e. @xmath38 , along with fermi / lat sensitivity curve for @xmath39 detection ( atwood et al .",
    "even when the distance is 2 times larger than we presently employed , fermi / lat should also be able to detect the expected gamma - ray emission of 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "also in figure 2 , when the inclination angle is small , e.g. @xmath36 , its high energy radiation is decreased along with an increase in the low energy part ( cf .",
    "fig 4 in cheng & zhang 2001 ) . therefore if the inclination angle is small ,",
    "although fermi / lat could not detect 4u 0142 + 61 in @xmath40 band , it could detect 4u 0142 + 61 in @xmath41 and lower energy band . in cheng & zhang ( 2001 )",
    ", the inclination angle determines the inner boundary of the outer gap .",
    "recent modeling indicates that the inner boundary may extend to 10 stellar radii ( hirotani et al .",
    "2003 ; hirotani & shibata 2001 ) . employing this assumption ,",
    "the corresponding model calculations are shown in figure 1 and 2 .    according to cheng & zhang ( 2001 ) and references",
    "therein , the solid angle for known gamma - ray pulsars ranges from @xmath42 .",
    "recent fermi observations of gamma - ray pulsars also show a relatively broad pulse profile ( ray & parkinson 2010 ) .",
    "therefore the beaming of gamma - ray radiation is not the key factor obscuring our observation of gamma - ray emissions and this problem can be cleared with future fermi / lat observations of more axps and sgrs .",
    "the magnetic field at the inner boundary of outer gap is @xmath43 for inclination angle @xmath31 ( or @xmath44 when the inner boundary is chosen as 10 stellar radii ) .",
    "the absorption of high energy photons is not significant at the inner boundary due the weakness of the magnetic field ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "for axp 4u 0142 + 61 , it has a debris disk whose photon energy is typically @xmath45 ( wang et al .",
    "the @xmath2 absorption is negligible for gev photons ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) .    in conclusion , based on the thick outer gap model ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) , for a variety of the parameter space in magnetar model , fermi /",
    "lat should be able to detect the expected high energy gamma - ray emission from axp 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "this is in conflict with sasmaz mus & gogus ( 2010 ) .    .",
    "the thick dashed line is the fermi / lat sensitivity curve ( atwood et al .",
    "at the beginning of  2 , we show that axps are not high energy gamma - ray emitters ( @xmath11 larger than 1 ) if they are normal neutron stars accreting from fallback disks .",
    "therefore the non - detection in a fermi / lat observation of axp 4u 0142 + 61 can be naturally explained in the accretion model for axps .",
    "the spectra energy distribution of 4u 0142 + 61 indicates an energy break at about @xmath46 ( sasmaz mus & gogus 2010 ) . if hard x - ray emission of 4u 0142 + 61 originates from near the stellar surface , the energy break is also at @xmath46 for a normal neutron star ( zhang & cheng 1997 )",
    "of course the detailed origin of axp hard x - ray emission needs further studies .    in the accretion model for axps ( alpar 2001 ;",
    "chatterjee et al . 2000 ) ( also for sgrs , if they are indeed one population ) , the long period of axps is due to disk braking in the propeller phase .",
    "they are now x - ray luminous since they have entered the accretion phase . the bursts of axps and sgrs may due to accretion induced quakes ( aiqs ) ( xu et al . 2006 ; xu 2007 ) , or quakes and plate tectonics of neutron stars ( rothschild et al .",
    "the accretion induced quake model of xu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) provides a link between persistent emission and bursts .",
    "a hybrid model is also possible which the magnetar field is in higher multipole form and the spin down is governed by a normal dipole component interacting with a fallback disk ( eksi & alpar 2003 ) .",
    "the recently reported low magnetic field sgr ( sgr 0418 + 5927 with @xmath47 , rea et al .",
    "2010 ) is consistent with the accretion model .    for axp 4u 0142 + 61 ,",
    "as noted in section 2 , it will not emit high energy gamma - rays even if it is a magnetar , when its radius is @xmath37 instead of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore future fermi / lat observations of more axps and sgrs are very necessary .",
    "outer gap predictions in the magnetar domain for other axps and sgrs are shown in figure 3 .",
    "model calculations for three axps and one sgr are shown , using observational parameters from the mcgill axp / sgr online catalog . for gamma - ray",
    "luminous and nearby sources , model calculations of axp 1e 1547.0 - 5408 and axp 1e 1048.1 - 5937 are well above the fermi / lat sensitivity curve . therefore future fermi / lat observations of these two sources",
    "are highly recommended . among other axps ,",
    "some are not supposed to be high - energy gamma - ray emitters ( @xmath11 larger than 1 ) , some have relatively low gamma - ray luminosities as shown for axp xte j1810 - 197 in figure 3 , some lies too far away from us .",
    "for the two candidate high energy gamma - ray emitting sgrs , sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 , they are too far away to be detected by fermi / lat , as shown for sgr 1806 - 20 in figure 3 .    in conclusion , based on the thick outer gap model ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) , the non - detection in a fermi / lat observation of axp 4u 0142 + 61 may prefer the accretion model .",
