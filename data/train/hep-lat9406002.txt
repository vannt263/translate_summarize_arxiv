    "nonrelativistic lattice qcd ( nrqcd ) is an effective field theory formulated to reproduce the action of continuum qcd at low energies @xcite .",

    "one possibility is to treat the couplings as adjustable parameters and tune them to fit certain experimental data ; however , this tuning significantly reduces the predictive power of nrqcd simulations and is very costly and difficult .",

    "this is done by evaluating various scattering amplitudes in both qcd and lattice nrqcd and adjusting the couplings until these amplitudes agree at low energies .",

    "is calculated to leading order in tadpole - improved perturbation theory and the on - mass - shell dispersion relation for the heavy quark is obtained .",
    "the mass renormalization , a shift in the zero point of energy , and the radiative corrections to the couplings of two important nrqcd interactions are determined by matching this dispersion relation to that of continuum qcd to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the expectation value of the heavy - quark velocity in a typical heavy - quark hadron .",

    "in addition , the scales at which to evaluate the running coupling for these quantities , except the wave function renormalization , are obtained for the first time using the lepage - mackenzie prescription .",
    "choosing a value for @xmath2 from recent simulation measurements of the qcd coupling , numerical estimates of the energy shift , mass renormalization , and the radiative corrections to the two so - called kinetic couplings are also obtained . when @xmath9 , where @xmath1 is the bare quark mass , the radiative corrections to the kinetic couplings are roughly 10% of the tree - level coupling strengths ; these corrections grow quickly as @xmath10 becomes small . a range of estimates for the energy shift and mass renormalization are obtained after circumventing certain defects in the lepage - mackenzie prescription for setting the scale .",
