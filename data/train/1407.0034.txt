    "one of the most intriguing aspects of modern cosmology is the formation of the first stars and galaxies .",
    "the first stars , so - called population  iii ( pop  iii ) , were responsible for the transition of the universe from its simple , metal - free state to one of ever increasing complexity .",
    "therefore , exploring their feedback on the pristine intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been one of the key themes in elucidating early cosmic evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pop  iii stars started forming at redshifts as early as @xmath8 out of primordial gas in dark matter ( dm ) minihaloes of total mass @xmath9 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "once the first stars began emitting ionizing radiation , the gas inside minihalo hosts was photoheated to a few @xmath10k . as a consequence ,",
    "pressure - driven outflows significantly suppressed central gas densities . after their brief lifetime of @xmath11yr , pop  iii stars may have exploded as supernovae ( sne ) or collapsed directly in black holes ( bhs ) , possibly without explosion .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the surrounding igm was shaped by the feedback from such pop  iii remnants ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if a pop  iii star died in a sn explosion , the ambient gas , already rarified by the radiation - hydrodynamical reaction to the star s ionizing radiation , was shock heated and hydrodynamically evacuated from the minihalo as the shock traversed the halo .",
    "the dispersal of heavy elements and dust from the first sne initiated the long history of cosmic chemical enrichment ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this enrichment was critical for star formation because the metal - enriched dusty gas was able to cool to the temperature floor set by the cosmic microwave background , @xmath122.7k@xmath13 , similar to the characteristic temperatures of star - forming clouds in the nearby universe .",
    "such low temperatures were hard to reach in metal - free primordial gas , in which molecular hydrogen was the main available coolant . therefore , the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) is expected to have changed from the top - heavy imf , predicted for pop  iii , to the low - mass dominated imf of population  ii",
    "( pop  ii ) , once enrichment levels exceeded a critical threshold . whether this threshold was linked to fine - structure line cooling or dust - continuum cooling is still debated , but there is general agreement that such a ` critical metallicity ' played an important role ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , a pop  iii star ended its life as a bh via direct collapse , subsequent gas accretion onto the remnant may have resulted in a miniquasar  a stellar mass black hole accreting near the eddington limit that emitted x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fate of a pop  iii star was determined by its mass and degree of rotation .",
    "non - rotating pop  iii stars with masses between @xmath14 and @xmath2 are thought to end their lives as core collapse sne , or as highly energetic pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) for masses in the range of @xmath15 ( @xcite ) , or directly collapse into a bh for other progenitor masses ( @xcite ) .",
    "stellar rotation may introduce significant changes to this picture ( @xcite ) .",
    "core - collapse of rapidly rotating stars may trigger energetic hypernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the lower mass - limit for a pisn could be reduced to @xmath16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic mass scale of pop  iii stars remains an open question ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "previously , the first stars were thought to be isolated and rather massive , with a characteristic mass of @xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent improved simulations have identified a ubiquitous disk fragmentation mode , revising the typical mass scale downwards to a few 10@xmath18 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "radiative feedback has recently been shown to put an additional limit to the masses of these stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . consequently ,",
    "pop  iii stars were more likely to end their lives as core collapse sne , rather than pisne .",
    "in addition , observed abundance patterns in the atmospheres of metal - poor galactic halo stars , expected to form out of gas enriched by pop  iii stars , have until recently not exhibited the strong elemental odd - even effect and the absence of any neutron - capture elements , which would be manifest signatures for pisne ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , very massive stars were rare , making them hard to detect , in agreement with some theoretical predictions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , or pop  iii stellar masses may have been limited to @xmath19 ( tumlinson 2006 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or the paucity of chemical evidence for pisne is due to the fact that the elements synthesized by pisne were widely dispersed due to the pisn s large explosion energies ( @xcite ) .

    "is taken from @xcite , who used identical initial conditions .",
    "[ table : sns ]    there has been a number of numerical studies investigating the impact of early sne on the gas surrounding the explosion sites and on the assembly process of the first galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the first stars were initially estimated to have very large masses @xmath28 , most of these early studies focused on the impact of the more energetic pisne .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite followed the impact of a single pisn with an explosion energy of @xmath27ergs until an atomic - cooling halo assembled at @xmath29 .",
    "they found that even a single pisn explosion could enrich the region out of which the first galaxies formed to supercritical metallicities @xmath30 , such that the first galaxies would typically host already metal - enriched pop  ii stellar systems .",
    "in contrast to pisne , the impact of the less energetic core collapse sne critically depended on the pop  iii progenitor mass and their environments , as was already found in one - dimensional , radiation - hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for instance , the gas in minihaloes with masses close to the cooling threshold for collapse , @xmath31 , was more vulnerable to photoionization heating by the stellar progenitor , which decreased the density of the gas into which the sn exploded .",
    "such conditions allowed sn ejecta to more easily escape the haloes . on the other hand , the ionizing radiation from pop  iii stars inside more massive @xmath32 host systems remained more strongly confined , such that the sn remnants encounter mostly intact high - density clouds .",
    "most of the sn explosion energy then was rapidly radiated away , and this impeded the escape of the metal - enriched gas to the igm .",
    "@xcite investigated such a case of prompt fallback in a three dimensional , cosmological grid - based hydrodynamic simulation , where a 40@xmath18 sn exploded in a minihalo of @xmath33 .",
    "the sn remnant remained partially trapped within the minihalo .",
    "roughly half of the ejecta turned around and fell back toward the center of the halo , with @xmath34 of the ejecta reaching the center in @xmath35 .",
    "the average metallicity of the combined returning ejecta and the pristine cosmic web filaments feeding into the halo center was @xmath36 , but the two fluids remained unmixed until accreting onto a central hydrostatic core , unresolved in the simulation .",
    "ritter et al .  concluded that if pop  iii stars had moderate masses , they could promptly enrich the host minihalos with metals and trigger pop  ii star formation .    while these pioneering studies brought into focus the key physics , they either considered only a few specific cases , not exploring the dependence on a varying cosmic environment , or employed somewhat simplified initial conditions .",
    "taking into account realistic cosmological initial conditions and exploring a broader parameter space is clearly desirable . as an example",
    ", an insufficient number of ionizing photons from @xmath37 pop  iii stars to achieve substantial gas evacuation from the host system might produce a highly asymmetric pre - explosion density distribution .",
    "the ensuing sn blastwave would then preferentially propagate along low - density channels , usually perpendicular to the cosmic filaments , resulting in highly non - uniform metal dispersal ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to address the environmental complexity of early sn feedback ,",
    "we here report on a suite of cosmological radiation - hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "we followed the evolution of the sn - processed gas to the point at which the second generation of stars began to form out of this metal - enriched material .",
    "we specifically ask : _ what is the delay between the initial pop  iii star formation event and the re - establishment of conditions for subsequent star formation ? _ addressing this question is crucial for understanding the assembly process of the first galaxies and their properties ( @xcite ) .    the severity of the pop  iii feedback is reflected in the mass scale of the first galaxies , since stronger feedback requires the assembly of more massive host systems for the sn - processed gas to be able to cool and recondense .",
    "this mass scale for the first galaxies in turn determines their luminosities and number density , with important implications for early reionization ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "pushing the high redshift frontier by observing the first galaxies is one of the main goals of next - generation facilities , such as the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) , the planned extremely large ground - based telescopes , the atacama large millimitre array ( alma ) , and the square kilometre array ( ska ) .",
    "the observability of the first galaxies will be determined by their star formation efficiencies and stellar imfs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the strength of sn driven outflows may be responsible for the observed dichotomy between carbon - enhanced and carbon - normal metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "these authors invoke two classes of sne with greatly different times for recovery from supernova explosions , such that rapid recovery is connected to weak explosions with large carbon overabundances , and slow recovery with strong explosions with normal carbon yields .",
    "pinning down gas dynamics in the aftermath of pop iii supernovae is clearly essential for completing the picture of how the early universe evolved and what kind of long - lived relics it left in the nearby universe .",
    "@xcite suggested another explanation for carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars . because the entropy to which the reverse shock raises the sn ejecta decreases with the ejecta mass coordinate , the central , iron - bearing ejecta are raised to a higher entropy and predominantly convect outward without cooling .",
    "this prevents the bulk of the pop iii iron yield from returning to the halo center to enrich the second - generation star forming event .",
    "having lower entropy , the carbon - bearing ejecta are more susceptible to cooling and can return to the central cloud , enriching new stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our numerical methodology is described in section [ sec : metho ] and the simulation results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",

    "we follow the evolution until the gas affected by the radiation of the pop  iii progenitor star and the ensuing sn explosion has recollapsed , reaching conditions where a second round of star formation can take place .        employing nested refinement of the cosmological initial conditions , the masses of dark matter ( dm ) and sph gas particles in the highest resolution region with an approximate linear size of @xmath48 are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively",

    "the asymmetric structure of the h  ii regions around the @xmath1 and @xmath2 stars , shown in fig .  [ fig : hiis ] , is reflected in the bifurcation of the gas properties inside @xmath60 : the gas lying along the cosmic filaments remains dense @xmath61 and cold @xmath62k , while that in the less dense regions is photoevaporated to @xmath63 and photoheated to @xmath64k .",

    "we aim to explore a representative subset of progenitor masses .",
    "we provide the properties of pop  iii progenitors and sn explosions in table  [ table : sns ] ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to consider environmental effects on the evolution of pop  iii sn remnants , we insert pop  iii stars in three different minihaloes inside the most highly resolved region . properties of these halos",
    "are provided in table  [ table : sns ] .",
    "we start our simulations at @xmath66 , corresponding to the time just before the first pop  iii star has formed .",
    "once the hydrogen number density exceeds @xmath67 , the highest - density sph particle is converted into a collisionless sink particle , subsequently accreting neighboring gas particles until its mass has reached the target pop  iii progenitor star mass ( see table  [ table : sns ] ) .",
    "the sink particle then becomes a source of ionizing radiation , emitted at a rate averaged over the main sequence lifetime computed by @xcite .",
    "the radiation spectrum is assumed to be a black - body spectrum at temperature @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for the stars of 15 , 25 , and 40 solar mass , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "we transport this ionizing radiation using the radiative transfer ( rt ) code traphic @xcite .",
    "traphic solves the time - dependent rt equation in sph simulations by tracing photon packets emitted by source particles in a photon - conserving manner .",
    "the rt is controlled by a set of parameters , which we choose identical to those employed in @xcite , except that we here use two frequency bins with bounding energies of [ 13.6 ev , 400 ev , 10 kev ] .",
    "recombination radiation is treated in the case b approximation ( for a discussion of the applicability of this approximation see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the ionizing radiation from pop  iii stars , we also track the lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation that dissociates @xmath54 and hd .",

    "particles are often assigned individual time steps , sorted in a hierarchical fashion , such that only a fraction of particles is ` active ' at any time .",
    "only the properties of active particles are updated at any given time .",
    "therefore , if a sn blast wave alters the internal energies of neighboring gas particles , only the active particles among them are able to react to this sudden change .",
    "inactive particles can not be updated right away and this introduces serious errors into the hydrodynamics .",
    "these errors can be reduced by imposing a sufficiently small upper limit on the individual time steps . however , using such a global constraint on the time steps is computationally expensive .    instead ,",
    "in order to elicit a prompt response to energy injection , we employ the time step limiter originally suggested by @xcite and developed further by @xcite .",
    "this limiter restricts the time steps of neighboring particles , specifically those within an sph smoothing kernel , such that the time step ratios do not exceed a given factor @xmath72 .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that when only the time step limiter is used , energy conservation may be strongly violated if energy is injected at a random time . to tackle this problem",
    ", @xcite implemented an update scheme where at the time of the sn explosion _ all _ @xmath73 neighboring particles inside of the explosion volume become active . in our simulations , we use both the time step limiter and the time step update by adopting the value of @xmath74 .",
    "this ensures the accurate integration of the sn explosion , and is substantially less computationally expensive than comparably accurate simulations that impose a small global upper limit on the particle timestep ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for reference ,",
    "the typical timesteps in our simulations are @xmath75yr .",
    "those can be reduced by an order of magnitude when needed , and the change in timesteps is controlled both by the timestep limiter and update procedure .",

    "the modeling of the chemical transport in sph simulations is a difficult task . in pure sph schemes ,",
    "there is no mass flux between particles . also , for sph to resolve the turbulent cascade that is the pre - condition for mixing would require much higher resolution than attainable in cosmological simulations .",
    "here , we implement a subgrid prescription for compositional diffusion as in @xcite , where metal transport between particles was modelled as a diffusion process ( @xcite ) .",
    "the discretized diffusion equation in the sph formalism is @xmath90 with @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the concentration of sph particle @xmath93 , @xmath94 the particle mass , @xmath95 the density at the particle location @xmath96 , @xmath97 the smoothing kernel evaluated at @xmath98 , the separation between particles @xmath93 and @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is a diffusion coefficient associated with particle @xmath93 .",
    "if a diffusion process is to meaningfully emulate turbulence - assisted chemical mixing , the diffusion coefficient must somehow reflect the amplitude of the local turbulent cascade on subgrid scales .",
    "for example , a cascade may be expected in the presence of strong shear that would excite the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "more generally , one might anticipate the strength of the subgrid turbulent cascade to scale with the amplitude of gas motions on the smallest resolved scales , ignoring the motions on larger scales . in grid - based hydrodynamic simulations , the loss of kinetic energy to subgrid scales has been modeled with a diffusion term with diffusivity @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the grid spacing and @xmath103 is the kinetic energy density on subgrid scales @xcite . in sph , we replace the grid spacing with the sph smoothing length @xmath104 and the kinetic energy density with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the velocity dispersion within the sph kernel , which for particle @xmath93 equals @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the velocity of particle @xmath93 .",

    "the high ionizing luminosities of very massive pop  iii stars with @xmath28 are sufficient to photoevaporate even the densest gas in the halo , producing a smooth h  ii region ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , as also noted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , at lower ionizing luminosities ( say , from pop  iii stars in the mass range @xmath124 ) , the densest clouds in the halo , often aligned with the filaments of the cosmic web , may self - shield and remain intact .",

    ", we also show the evolution of the baryon fraction when only photoionization by the pop  iii star was enabled , with no subsequent sn explosion ( denoted by the black lines in fig .  [ fig : energy ] ) .",
    "[ fig : energy ] shows that photoionization by the 40@xmath18 pop  iii star was already strong enough to blow out most of the gas , at @xmath151pc , resulting in a significant decrease of the baryon fraction to @xmath152 prior to the sn explosion . at 9myr after the death of the star , about 80@xmath153 of the gas mass is driven out of the virial radius .",
    "the resulting deficit of gas at the center lasts for 42myr and 3.5myr with and without sn explosion , respectively .",
    "the relative impact of the sn explosion on the central region is stronger in the @xmath1 case .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the baryon fraction with and without sn explosion , the latter remaining nearly constant over the run time , and dropping by @xmath154 at @xmath155myr when the sn is included .",
    "after @xmath156myr , @xmath155myr , and @xmath157myr for the @xmath119 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 stars ( in halo1 ) , the central baryon fraction starts to increase as the gravitational force pulls back the gas .",
    "the haloes then attain central densities of up to @xmath158 within the next 2myr , 14myr , and 40myr , respectively .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : snaps ] , we present the projected hydrogen number densities , temperatures , and metallicities for the 15@xmath18 , 25@xmath18 , and 40@xmath18 stars ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the snapshots show the time at which the gas flow reverses from net outflow to inflow .",

    "similar to the expansion direction of the h  ii region , the sn energy is preferentially transferred into underdense regions , perpendicular to the direction of cosmic filaments .",
    "we next estimate the recovery timescale , defined as the time delay between the first star formation event in a given halo and the recollapse of the gas affected by photoionization and the sn blastwave to high densities , such that a second generation of stars can form .",
    "this timescale sensitively depends on the sn progenitor mass .",
    "if we consider the same sn input energy , the difference in recovery timescale arises solely from the pre - explosion configuration shaped by the stellar - mass - dependent ionizing luminosity .",
    "specifically , more massive pop  iii stars have a stronger impact on the ambient gas , suppressing central gas densities prior to the explosion more strongly . as a consequence ,",
    "the sn remnants suffer smaller radiative losses , and are thus able to escape further into the igm . in our simulations ,",
    "we find recovery times of @xmath156myr , @xmath168myr , and @xmath169myr for the @xmath119 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 stars , respectively ( in halo1 ) .",
    "these timescales are shorter by 8myr , 15myr , and 30myr when no sn explosion is included ( see open circles in fig .  [",
    "fig : sn ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that since we use a fixed sn energy , @xmath170 , for all three progenitors , the difference in the recovery time arises from differences in the photoionization feedback during the pre - explosion phase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn ] we also mark the results from @xcite , where they followed the evolution of the gas after a @xmath171 pisn explosion . given that we here use the same initial conditions as in @xcite , a direct comparison is possible .",
    "the recovery time in their work was of order the hubble time , @xmath172myr , at @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , the work by @xcite , where they studied the gas evolution and metal enrichment from a @xmath2 core collapse sn with @xmath170 , suggests a shorter recovery timescale , @xmath173myr .",
    "the reason for the much shorter recovery timescale compared to our simulation of a sn explosion with a @xmath174 progenitor , is twofold .",
    "first , their halo mass at recovery was @xmath175 , which is four times higher than the mass of our halo1 .",
    "second , as they explain in their section 2.4 , their treatment of the pre - explosion photoionization by the pop  iii progenitor artifically underestimated the degree of photoheating , such that gas densities remained high .",
    "any radiative losses from the sn blastwave thus were overestimated .",
    "in addition to the core - collapse sne , we show the case of a @xmath2 hypernova with an energy @xmath176 exploding in a substantially more massive halo of @xmath177 ( @xcite ) . here , the gas again quickly recollapses in @xmath156myr .",
    "this broad range of recovery timescales suggests a strong dependence on environment .    to explore this environmental dependence ,",
    "we have performed additional simulations by assuming that a @xmath2 or a @xmath1 pop  iii star forms in halo2 with mass @xmath178 and halo3 with mass @xmath179 .",
    "we use the same explosion energy @xmath180 in all cases . due to the deeper potential",
    "well of halo2 , the deleterious impact of the pop  iii stars is weaker than in halo1 and halo3 . in halo2 ,",
    "a larger fraction of the gas is more likely to resist photoevaporation by the @xmath2 pop  iii star , maintaining central densities of @xmath181 .",
    "these are substantially higher than the typical densities in halo1 when exposed to the same pop  iii stellar radiation .",
    "consequently , the sn remnants encounter higher density gas , thus experiencing more rapid energy dissipation through radiative cooling , leading to a shorter recovery time . specifically , the estimated recovery time for the @xmath2 star in halo2 is @xmath182myr , similar to the recovery time found in @xcite , which investigated a @xmath2 pop  iii star exploding in a halo with mass @xmath178 .",
    "on the other hand , the impact of the pop  iii feedback in halo3 extends to much longer times : it takes more than 100myr for the gas expelled by photoionization and the sn blastwave of a @xmath2 star to recollapse to high densities .",
    "this is largely due to the rather isolated environment of halo3 which impedes gas accretion onto the halo . in fig .",
    "[ fig : haloes ] , we compare the density field in different haloes 25myr after the sn explosion for the @xmath2 case . in all haloes , the hydrodynamic shock driven by the explosion propagates to @xmath183pc . while the central gas in halo2 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : haloes ] ) has already reached densities high enough to fulfill the condition for star formation , densities in halo1 and halo3 are still low .",
    "next , we address the question of when the gas flow changes sign , reverting from net outflow to inflow . fig .",
    "[ fig : netflow ] presents the evolution of the gas ( circles ) and metal ( triangles ) flow through a sphere of radius 30pc , centered on the location of the sn explosion .",

    "along with the gas , metal - enriched material is brought back in .",
    "the transition from net outflow to inflow for the metals occurs a few million years after it has occurred for the gas regardless of the metal content .",
    "this is because metal - free gas can also be delivered onto the central region along the filaments of the cosmic web .",
    "the situation is more complicated in halo2 . for the @xmath2 case",
    ", the transition happens at @xmath185myr , but again reverting into an outflow for the next 25myr .",
    "this unstable flow is due to the environmental complexity , leading to unsteady accretion .",
    "we also note that the stellar feedback from the @xmath1 pop  iii star in halo2 is initially not strong enough to reverse the cosmological inflow of gas , resulting in a delayed outflow until @xmath131myr after the sn explosion .",

    "afterwards , metal dispersal is modeled as a diffusion process , as described in section  [ sec : metal ] . as seen in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : metals ] , at the end of the simulation the metals from the @xmath119 explosion can penetrate to @xmath188 pc , mainly enriching the underdense regions ( @xmath189 ) to @xmath190 , while the high density regions ( @xmath61 ) located far ( @xmath191 pc ) from the halo , hosting the @xmath119 star , are kept primordial .",
    "about 17@xmath153 , 20@xmath153 , and 42@xmath153 of the gas mass within 600pc is enriched above @xmath192 for the @xmath119 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 stars , respectively . the typical extent to which the metals are dispersed is @xmath193 pc , @xmath194 kpc , and @xmath195 kpc , for the @xmath119 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 stars , respectively . as expected , metal dispersion preferentially proceeds into the low - density phases of the igm .",
    "interestingly , in halo1 the central gas at @xmath196 pc , where densities are high enough to form stars , is enriched to @xmath197 .",
    "this is above the critical metallicity , @xmath198 , for enabling low - mass star formation via metal or dust grain cooling . as shown in the left - bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : metals ] , there are other high density peaks close to @xmath158 within the central 600 pc . the high density gas ( @xmath199 ) near @xmath200 pc has not yet been contaminated with metals , while the surrounding , relatively low density gas , is enriched to @xmath201 .",
    "the high - density peak has avoided contamination because the gas collapsed into the halo prior to the arrival of the metals , and the mixing of metals into such pre - condensed structures was inefficient and slow . on the other hand ,",

    "significant uncertainties remain . by way of fine - structure line cooling , mainly involving c  ii and o  i",
    ", metal - enriched gas is able to fragment to form a cluster of pop  ii stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the minimum metallicity required to enable such widespread fragmentation is @xmath204 .",
    "although with fine - structure cooling , thermal jeans masses are of order a few @xmath14 , it may still be possible to form low - mass stars ( @xmath205 ) if some of the fragments get dynamically ejected from the cluster , thus prematurely curtailing gas accretion ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a second pathway toward low - mass star formation is enabled when the initial dust - to - gas mass ratio , where the dust grains are produced during the first sn explosions ( @xcite ) , exceeds a critical level of @xmath206\\times10^{-9}$ ] ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the critical metallicity in this scenario is a few orders of magnitude below that for the atomic line cooling scenario .",
    "therefore , the density peak at @xmath207 pc , enriched to a few @xmath208 , is not capable of forming pop  ii stars based on atomic line cooling alone , but it satisfies the condition for fragmentation set by dust cooling .",
    "do current observations , obtained by the stellar archeology of low - mass , metal - poor stars , provide us with hints for this theoretical debate ?",

    "however , there are counter - examples , specifically the most metal - poor star found to date , in which _ all _ elements , including c and o , are underabundant @xcite . here , dust cooling seems to be required @xcite .",
    "the empirical picture is thus complex , with possible roles for both cooling channels @xcite .",
    "we have performed a suite of cosmological three - dimensional simulations to investigate the recovery from pop  iii core - collapse sne with a mass range for the progenitor stars of @xmath211 .",
    "we have also investigated the chemical impact of the sne on the next episode of star formation .",
    "we found that the radiative feedback from pop  iii stars plays an important role in setting the initial configuration for the subsequent sn by reducing the gas density prior to the explosion . unlike the photoionization by massive pop  iii stars with @xmath212 , the radiative impact from less massive pop  iii stars with @xmath213 is less strong in evacuating gas out of the host halo",
    "therefore , the ejecta from the sne are more likely to encounter a high density ambient medium , in which the ejecta cool more rapidly and may be re - accreted earlier .",
    "we find that the time it takes for the sn - processed gas to fall back into the halo that hosts a pop  iii star with a moderate mass is of the order of a few 10myr .",
    "we also explore the effect of the environment by exploding sne in different host haloes .",
    "we find that the impact of a pop  iii sn explosion in a @xmath214 halo is more violent than in a @xmath215 halo .     and then grow for @xmath216myr to assemble an atomically cooling galaxy in a @xmath217 dm halo .",
    "the impact of a pisn is very destructive , delaying the gas collapse in the halo for @xmath218myr ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the delay of second generation star formation that is introduced by pop  iii core - collapse sne is shorter , of the order of a few 10myr .",
    "the properties of the first stars , in particular their mass , thus govern the nature of the first galaxies . [",
    "fig : fg],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the context of hierarchical cosmology , structures assemble from the bottom up : smaller objects collapse first , making bigger structures .",
    "the first galaxies , thus , are believed to have grown by assembling roughly @xmath4 pop  iii star - forming minihaloes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fg ] and * ? ? ?",
    "theoretically , one often defines the first galaxies as the dm haloes with masses @xmath219 , collapsing at @xmath220 .",
    "these objects are massive enough to retain the gas that was affected by previous star formation , and this gas inside the galaxy is able to cool via atomic hydrogen line emission .",
    "previous works by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite show that a single pisn explosion in a minihalo can be sufficiently violent , destroying the minihalo in which the pisn explodes and enriching the central star - forming gas in the nascent galaxy to @xmath221 .    on the other hand , as shown in this work ,",
    "the impact of core - collapse sne with progenitor masses @xmath222 on the delay of gas collapse and thus on the next episode of star formation is prompt , @xmath223myr .",
    "depending on the halo environment and halo mass , this timescale may vary from 10myr to 100myr , but always remains substantially smaller than the delay of @xmath218myr resulting from a pisn .",
    "this suggests that multiple star formation episodes , likely occurring in the pop  ii mode , may be triggered at the site that was affected by core - collapse pop  iii stars , even before the system evolves into a substantially more massive galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the range of primordial stellar masses remains uncertain .",
    "a recent investigation carried out by @xcite , where they study @xmath224100 different cosmological sites of pop  iii star formation , shows that the masses of pop  iii stars might be from a few tens to hundreds of solar masses , depending mainly on gas accretion rates in the star - forming clouds .",
    "in addition , a recently observed metal - poor milky way star exhibits the elemental odd - even effect , possibly a chemical signature of pisne ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the relative importance of core - collapse sne and pisne in shaping the formation of the first galaxies will depend crucially on the pop  iii imf .    in summary ,",
    "our simulations imply that the central cold and dense gas can be enriched above @xmath225 by a single core - collapse pop  iii sn .",
    "given the expected multiple star formation events before the collapse of the minihalo host into a @xmath217 atomically cooling halo , it is likely that the central star - forming gas in the first galaxies is substantially polluted with metals , possibly initiating pop  ii star formation in the first galaxies .",
