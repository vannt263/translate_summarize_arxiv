    "the abundance patterns of the extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars are good indicators of supernova ( sn ) nucleosynthesis , because the galaxy was effectively unmixed at [ fe / h ] @xmath3 .",
    "thus they could provide useful constraints on the nature of first supernovae and thus first stars .",
    "the emp stars are classified into three groups according to [ c / fe ] ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) :    \\(1 ) [ c / fe ] @xmath4 , normal emp stars ( @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath6 ) ;    \\(2 ) [ c / fe ] @xmath7 , carbon - enhanced emp ( cemp ) stars ( @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath6 ) ;    \\(3 ) [ c / fe ] @xmath8 , hyper metal - poor ( hmp ) stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9 , e.g. , he  01075240 , @xcite ; he  13272326 , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , table 1 summarizes other abundance features of various emp stars .",
    "many of these emp stars have high [ co / fe ] .",
    "we have shown that such peculiar abundance patterns can not be explained by conventional normal supernova nucleosynthesis but can be reproduced by nucleosynthesis in hyper - energetic and hyper - aspherical explosions , i.e. , hypernovae ( hne ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the abundance pattern of the ultra metal - poor ( ump ) star",

    "the co / fe ratio ( [ co / fe ] @xmath14 ) requires a high energy explosion and the high [ sc / ti ] and [ ti / fe ] ratios require a high - entropy explosion .",
    "the hn model is in a good agreement with the abundance pattern of he  05574840 .",
    "the model indicates @xmath15 @xmath1 being similar to faint sn models for cemp stars .    the abundance pattern of the cemp - no star ( i.e. , cemp with no neutron capture elements ) he  1300 + 0157 ( @xcite ) is shown in figure  [ fig : ump ] ( lower ) and marginally reproduced by the hypernova model with @xmath16 @xmath1 and @xmath17 .",
    "the large [ co / fe ] particularly requires the high explosion energy .    previously , hypernova - like explosions with @xmath18 have been found only in type ic supernovae ( sne ic ) , which are core - collapse supernova and characterized by the lack of hydrogen and helium .",
    "recently , several interesting type ib supernovae ( sne ib ) have been observed to show quite peculiar features .",
    "sne ib are another type of envelope - stripped core collapse sn but characterized by the presence of prominent he lines .",
    "thus it is interesting to examine the explosion energy and other properties of sne ib in comparison with hypernovae and normal sne .",

    "sn 2008d was discovered as a luminous x - ray transient in ngc 2770 .",

    "these he stars correspond to the main - sequence masses of @xmath32 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , and 40 @xmath1 stars ( @xcite ) .    since the timescale around the peak depends on both the ejected mass @xmath33 and @xmath12 as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the optical opacity ( @xcite ) , a specific kinetic energy is required for each model to reproduce the observed timescale .",
    "the derived set of ejecta parameters are ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 erg ) @xmath21 ( 2.7 , 1.1 ) , ( 4.4 , 3.7 ) , ( 6.2 , 8.4 ) , ( 7.7 , 13.0 ) and ( 12.5 , 26.5 ) for the case of he4 , he6 , he8 , he10 and he16 , respectively .",
    "the ejected @xmath19ni  mass is @xmath250.07 @xmath1 in all models .",
    "figure 3 shows the comparison between the observed and calculated spectra .",
    "it seems that he4 , he10 and he16 are not consistent with sn 2008d , and that a model between he6 and he8 is preferable .",
    "we thus conclude that the progenitor star of sn 2008d had a he core mass @xmath31 68  @xmath1 and exploded with @xmath38 @xmath1 and @xmath39 erg .",
    "the mass of the central remnant is 1.61.8 @xmath1 , which is near the boundary mass between the neutron star and the black hole .",
    "figure [ fig : me ] shows @xmath12 as a function of @xmath40 for several core - collapse sne ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "these facts suggest that sn 2005bf is the explosion with lower @xmath41 ratio .     as a function of the main sequence mass @xmath40 of the progenitors for several supernovae / hypernovae ( @xcite ) . , width=377 ]    the spectra of sn 2008d and type ib / c supernova ( sn ib / c ) 1999ex are very similar ( @xcite ) , while sn 2005bf has lower he velocities .",
    "the he lines in type iib supernova ( sn iib ) 1993j are very weak at this epoch .",
    "the fe features at 4500 - 5000  are similar in these four sne , but those in sn ib 2005bf are narrower .",
    "malesani  ( 2008 ) suggested that the bolometric lcs of sne 1999ex and 2008d are similar .",
    "the similarity in both the lc and the spectra suggests that sn ib / c 1999ex is also as energetic as sn 2008d in the @xmath12@xmath40 diagram .",
    "malesani  ( 2009 ) also pointed the similarity of the lcs of sne iib 1993j and ib 2008d .",
    "but the expansion velocity is higher in sn 2008d ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , both the mass and the kinetic energy of the ejecta are expected to be smaller in sn iib 1993j .",
    "in fact , sn 1993j is explained by the explosion of a 4 @xmath1 he core with a small mass h - rich envelope ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .     and @xmath42  @xmath1 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath1 , and @xmath17 and @xmath45 @xmath1 , and the lcs of sn  2006jc ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) ( @xcite ) .",

    "another recent sn ib 2006jc is characterized by the dust formation in the ejecta as found from the near - infrared ( nir ) and mid - infrared ( mir ) observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we present a theoretical model for sn ib 2006jc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the progenitor star , hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis of the sn explosion , and the sn bolometric lc .",
    "the synthetic bolometric lc is compared with the observed bolometric lc constructed by integrating the uv , optical , nir , and mir fluxes .",
    "the progenitor is assumed to be as massive as 40 @xmath1 on the zero - age main - sequence .",
    "the star undergoes extensive mass loss to reduce its mass down to as small as 6.9 @xmath1 , thus becoming a wco wolf - rayet star .",
    "the wco star model has a thick carbon - rich layer , in which amorphous carbon grains can be formed .",
    "this could explain the nir brightening and the dust feature seen in the mir spectrum .",
    "we suggest that the progenitor of sn  2006jc is a wco wolf - rayet star having undergone strong mass loss and such massive stars are the important sites of dust formation .",
    "we derive the parameters of the explosion model in order to reproduce the bolometric lc of sn  2006jc by the radioactive decays : the ejecta mass 4.9 @xmath1 , hypernova - like explosion energy @xmath51 ergs , and ejected @xmath19ni  mass 0.22 @xmath1 .",
    "we also calculate the circumstellar interaction and find that a csm with a flat density structure is required to reproduce the x - ray lc of sn  2006jc .",
    "this suggests a drastic change of the mass - loss rate and/or the wind velocity that is consistent with the past luminous blue variable ( lbv)-like event .",
    "we have thus found sn ib 2006jc is almost a hn - like energetic explosion .",
    "this is suggestive for the sn ib contribution to the early enrichment in the universe .",
    "also dust formation in wco star seems to be quite important .",
    "we presented a theoretical model for sn 2008d associated with the luminous x - ray transient 080109 , which well reproduced the bolometric lc and optical spectra .",
    "this is the first detailed model calculation for the sn ib that is discovered shortly after the explosion .",
    "sn 2008d is located between the normal sne and the `` hypernovae branch '' in the @xmath12@xmath40 diagram ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : me ] ) .",
    "the ejected @xmath19ni  mass in sn 2008d ( @xmath250.07 @xmath1 ) is similar to the @xmath19ni  masses ejected by normal sne and much smaller than those in grb - sne .",
    "these energetic sne ib , as indicated from both 2008d and 2006jc , and also energetic sn ib / c 1999ex , could result from the spiral - in of a low mass binary companion into a massive star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spiral - in can eject the h - rich envelope by heating , and also bring the orbital angular momentum into the core ( @xcite ) .",
    "sne ib are less energetic than sne ic , because the effects of the spiral - in are smaller in sne ib , where the he - layer is not ejected and smaller angular momentum is brought into the core than in sne ic ."
