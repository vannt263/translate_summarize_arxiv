    "such transitions have been observed in a variety of systems including for example @xmath0 [ 9,10 ] and ethylene [ 11,12 ] adsorbed on graphite .",
    "many experiments works have for subject the study of wetting transitions",

    "however , a simple lattice gas model with layering transitions and critical points has been introduced and studied in the mean field approximation by de oliveira and griffiths [ 32 ] .",
    "these experimental studies have motivated many theoretical works .",

    "the variational and mean field approximation have been used to investigate many interest problems such as ; the dewetting , partial wetting and spreading of a two - dimensional monolayer on solid surface [ 42 ] , the line tension between fluid phases and a substrate [ 43 ] , the effect of confinement and surface enhancement on superconductivity [ 44 ] , the symmetric polymer blend confined into a film with antisymmetric surfaces [ 45 ] , the wetting of potassium surfaces by superfluid @xmath1 [ 46 ] , the filling transition for edge [ 47 ] , the wetting of film on chemically heterogeneous substrates [ 48 ] , the wetting and the interaction potential between spherical particles [ 49 ] , the phase diagram for morphological transitions of wetting films on chemically structured substrates [ 50 ] , the phase behavior of colloidal binary hard - platelet and hard - rod fluids [ 51 ] , the influence of random self - affine and mound substrate roughness on the wetting of adsorbed van der waals films [ 52 ] , the wetting of van der waals solid films on self - affine rough surfaces [ 53 ] , the preroughening and reentrant layering transitions on triangular lattice substrates [ 54 ] , the layering transitions , disordered flat phases , reconstruction , and roughening of a semi - infinite crystal [ 55 ] .",
    "other method have been used to study wetting phenomena such as ; the renormalization group of the capillary parameter at complete wetting [ 56 ] , the surface deconstruction and roughening in the multiziggurat model of wetting [ 57 ] , the morphological transitions of wetting layers on structured surfaces [ 58 ] , the limiting height at which a solid can approach an air - water surface without becoming wet [ 59 ] , the surface roughness and hydrodynamic boundary slip of a newtonian fluid in completely wetting system [ 60 ] , the modeling at low temperature of a @xmath1 film adsorbed on a li substrate [ 61 ] and the prewetting of @xmath1 on rubidium [ 62 ] , the critical adsorption on defects in ising magnets and binary alloys [ 63 ] , the exact study of edge filling transition for ising corners [ 64 ] , the wetting hysteresis at the molecular scale [ 65 ] , the wetting transition in a two - dimensional ising model with a free rough surface [ 66 ] .",
    "ebner and saam [ 67 ] carried out monte carlo simulations of such a lattice gas model .",
    "huse [ 68 ] applied renormalizaion group technique to this model .",
    "it allowed the study of the effects on an atomic scale or order disorder transitions in the adsorbed layers , which may have considerable influence on the layering transitions and tracing back macroscopic phenomena on inter - atomic potentials .",
    "benyoussef and ez - zahraouy have studied the layering transitions of ising model thin films using a real space renormalization group [ 69 ] , and transfer matrix methods [ 70 ] . using the mean field theory , hong [ 71 ] , have found that depending on the values of the exchange integrals near the surface region , the film critical temperature may be lower , higher than , or equal to that of the bulk .",
    "on the other hand , the development of molecular - beam epitaxy has allowed the fabrication of high quality thin films [ 72 ] . among them ,",
    "the magnetic film consisting on a few atomic layers is of particular importance , as it has been used as a convenient model for theoretical and experimental analysis of a variety of magnetic phenomena .",
    "one other problem investigated is the critical temperature at which the system undergoes a magnetic - nonmagnetic phase transition .",
    "of particular interest is the change of this temperature when the magnetic system becomes finite in a given direction .",
    "briefly , depending on the values of magnetic coupling constants near the surface region , two different behaviors at the surface can be demonstrated [ 71 ] : ( i ) the surface critical temperature is the same as of the bulk one when the coupling constant on the surface is smaller than a critical value `` ordinary transition '' .",
    "( ii ) the surface critical temperature may be higher than the corresponding bulk one when the surface coupling is larger than the critical value `` extraordinary transition '' . at the critical ratio , one encounters the `` special transition point '' , with critical properties of the surface transition deviating from those at the ordinary or the distinct surface transition . as for the film system , which is finite in one direction",
    ", it has been established that its magnetic properties can differ greatly from those of the corresponding bulk [ 73 - 77 ] .",
    "experimental results [ 78 ] showed that the critical temperature of a vanadium film depends on the film thickness and its critical behavior is like that of the two - dimensional system rather than that of the three - dimensional bulk .",
    "since the theory of surface critical phenomena started developing , much attention has been devoted to the study of the blume capel ( bc ) model over semi - infinite lattices , with modified surface couplings .",
    "phase diagrams in the mean field approximation reporting four possible topologies at fixed bulk / surface coupling ratios have been determined [ 79 - 83 ] .",
    "an analogous analysis have also been done using a real space renormalization group transformation [ 84 ] .",
    "some other works referring to particular regions of the phase space are , for example , those using : the mean field approximation [ 85 ] , the effective field approximation [ 86 ] and the low temperature expansion [ 87 ] .",
    "these works show that it is possible to have a phase with ordered surface and disordered bulk , which is separated from the completely ordered phase by the so - called _ extraordinary _ transition and from the completely disordered phase by the _ surface _ transition . in the absence of this phase ,",
    "the transition between the completely ordered and the completely disordered phase is called _",
    "ordinary_. these three kinds of phase transitions have a meeting point named _ special _ which is generally a multi - critical point . * * the discussion presented in ref . [",
    "88 ] shows that the strong interest in these models arises partly from the unusually rich phase transition behavior they display as their interaction parameters are varied , and partly from their many possible applications . the bilinear interaction considered in",
    "most of these cases is ferromagnetic .",
    "the spin-@xmath2 ising systems are used to describe both the order - disorder transition and the crystallization of the binary allow , and it was solved for the anti - ferromagnetic case in the mean field approach [ 89 ] .",
    "the decomposition of a line of tri - critical points into a line of critical end points and one of double critical points is one of the most interesting features of the mean field phase diagram for the anti - ferromagnetic spin-@xmath2 blume - capel model in an external magnetic field [ 90 ] .",
    "the transfer - matrix and monte carlo finite - size - scaling methods [ 91 ] , are also applied to study this model but such decomposition does not occur in the two dimensional case .",
    "the finite cluster approximation has been applied by benyoussef _",
    "et al . _ [ 92 ] in order to study the spin-@xmath2 ising model with a random crystal field .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse field or crystal field effects of spin-@xmath2 ising model has been studied by several authors [ 93 - 96 ] .",
    "the experimental measurements of layer - by - layer ordering phenomena have been established on free - standing liquid crystals films such as @xmath3 @xmath4 [ 97,98 ] and @xmath5 ( n - pentyl-4-n - pentanoyloxy - biphenyl-4-carboxylate ) [ 99 ] for several molecular layers .",
    "more recently , lin _ el al . _",
    "[ 100 ] have used the three - level potts model to show the existence of layer - by - layer ordering of ultra thin liquid crystal films of free - standing @xmath5 films , by adjusting the interlayer and intra layer couplings between nearest- neighboring molecules .",
    "depending on the value of the crystal field at the surface some systems undergo a phase transition from a completely disordered state , at high temperatures , to a state with the first @xmath6 layers disordered and the rest of the layers ordered at low very temperatures .",
    "one can then observe a particular behavior when the transition to the order state of the @xmath7 layer occurs not only with the decrease but also with the increase of the temperature .",
    "such phase transitions are called the reentrant phenomena .",
    "the reentrant first - order layering transitions have been observed experimentally in multilayer argon films on graphite by youn and hess [ 101 ] .",
    "interesting results were obtained within mfa such [ 102 ] as order - disorder layering transitions and reentrant phenomena .",
    "but it is well known that the mfa approximation does not take into account the thermal fluctuations and neglects correlations between spins .",
    "this can lead to incorrect results .",
    "the blume - capel model ( bc ) was originally proposed to study the first - order magnetic phase transitions in spin@xmath8 ising systems [ 103 ] .",
    "this model was generalized to the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) to study phase separation and superfluity in @xmath9he-@xmath10he mixtures [ 104 ] .",
    "later it has been applied to describe properties of multicomponent fluids [ 105 ] , semiconductor alloys [ 106 ] and electronic conduction models [ 107 ] .",
    "the ( bc ) model is not exactly solvable in more than one dimension , but it has been studied over infinite @xmath11-dimensional lattices by means of many different approximate techniques and its phase diagram is well known .    on the other hand , ferroelectric films can be described by an ising model and when the film becomes very thick , its properties are those of the semi - infinite ising system [ 108 - 110 ] . from the experimental point of view , the most commonly studied magnetic multilayers are those of ferromagnetic transition metal such as fe / ni , where the coupling can exist between magnetic layers [ 111 - 113 ] .",
    "the discovery of enormous values of magnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers are far exceeding those found in single layer films and so exceeds the discovery of oscillatory interlayer coupling in transition metal multilayers .",
    "these experimental studies have motivated much theoretical works to study magnetic thin films as well as critical phenomena [ 114 - 117 ] .",
    "this is partly motivated by the development of new growth and characterization techniques , but perhaps more so by the discovery of many exciting new properties , some quite unanticipated .",
    "the effect of the surface and bulk transverse fields on the phase diagrams of a semi infinite spin-@xmath2 ferromagnetic ising model with a crystal field was investigated [ 118 - 119 ] within a finite cluster approximation with an expansion technique for cluster identities of spin-@xmath2 localized spin systems .",
    "substantial research efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of quantum - dot structures , due to the interesting electronic and optical properties that can result from quantum confinement .",
    "several novel applications for such structures have been envisaged such as the single - electron transistor and intersubband quantum - dot infrared photodetectors .",
    "the well studied technique of creating quantum dots is the use of @xmath12 deposition on @xmath13 [ 120,121 ] .",
    "a significant number of studies have been performed with the aim of understanding the structural and compositional evolution of @xmath13 islands growing .",
    "the role played by different growth parameters such as temperature , pressure and others have been studied for different growth techniques .",
    "the evolution of self assembled @xmath13 islands in low pressure chemical vapor deposition of @xmath13 on @xmath12 , using high growth rates , has been investigated by atomic force microscopy and rutherford backscattering spectrometry [ 122 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the understanding of the nature and consequences of adsorbate - adsorbate interactions at solid surfaces is of great interest in engineering properties of interfacial materials .",
    "many recent studies show that indirect interactions , mediated by the structure , can be significant enough to influence the formation of nano - structures at surfaces [ 123 ] .",
    "indeed , much progress has been made recently in understanding adatom - pair interactions mediated by shockley surface state electrons and the oscillatory interaction decays with adsorbate separation thickness [ 124 - 127 ] .",
    "monte carlo simulations [ 128 - 130 ] and subsequently derived mean field theories [ 129,131 ] , showed the existence of higher island densities than those expected by standard nucleation theory . it is shown that several experimental works , e.g. [ 127,132 - 134 ] , supports these predictions , such as the deposition of @xmath14 on mica substrates at a high temperature [ 135 - 142 ] .    in most cases , the electrical conductivity and practical utility of discontinuous metal films ,",
    "have been extensively explored [ 143 - 145 ] . on the other hand , media that are magnetized perpendicular to the plane of the film , such as ultra thin cobalt films or multi layered structures [ 146,147 ] ,",
    "are more stable against thermal self - erasure [ 144,148 ] than conventional memory devices . in this context ,",
    "magneto - optical memories seem particularly promising for ultrahigh - density recording on portable disks .",
    "the roughness and mobility of the magnetic domain walls [ 149,150 ] prevents closer packing of the magnetic bits , and therefore presents a challenge to reaching even higher bit densities .",
    "increasing information storage to high densities may evolve through extensions of current magnetic recording technologies .",
    "but such increases in storage density might be achieved by using other techniques such as holography , or micro machined nano - cantilever arrays [ 151 ] .",
    "the bit - writing with local probes may be thermally assisted by a current [ 152 ] or a laser beam that raises local temperature to the vicinity of the curie temperature , resulting in the formation of a reversed domain with a rough wall . on the other hand , a strain implemented by a linear defect , in a magnetic thin film [ 153 ] , can realize smooth and stable domain walls , that can be implemented without nano - scale patterning , furthermore , composite materials such as multilayer coatings and isotropic nanocomposite coatings , having structures in the nanometer scale , can even show properties , which can not be obtained by a single coating material alone [ 154 ] .",
    "the most widely used coatings are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and combination thereof , as well as some coatings with lubrificating properties such as diamond - like carbon .",
    "monte carlo simulations are applied to study the equilibrium magnetic domain structure of growing ultra thin ferromagnetic films with a realistic atomic structure [ 155 ] . near the percolation threshold a metastable magnetic domain structure",
    "is obtained with an average domain area ranging between the area of individual magnetic islands and the area of the large domains observed for thicker ferromagnetic films .",
    "this micro - domain structure is controlled and stabilized by the non - uniform atomic nano - structure of the ultra - thin film , causing a random interaction between magnetic islands with varying sizes and shapes .",
    "the investigation of the magnetic domain formation , in nano - structured ultra - thin films , is an active field of current research .",
    "the influence of the atomic morphology on the magnetic properties is known to be especially strong during the initial states of the thin film growth .",
    "a small variation of the preparation conditions may considerably change the obtained magnetic structure .",
    "this has been shown , by resolving imaging techniques , which allows the investigation of atomic structure as well as the magnetic domain structure of several nanostructured systems [ 156,160 - 161 ] .",
    "the influence of the presence of a surface up on the bulk critical behavior has been the focus of scientific interest during the last decade [ 162 - 164 ] . since the free surface is the natural break of the translational symmetry in any real system , critical phenomena at perfect surfaces",
    "have attracted much interest .",
    "furthermore , the phase diagram for the semi - infinite ising model is well established [ 162,164 ] .",
    "moreover , surface critical exponents have been estimated , both theoretically .",
    "the general agreement is quite satisfactory [ 162 - 164 ] .",
    "the critical behavior of magnetic materials with variable strength of coupling on the surface is characterized by surface critical exponents independent of the bulk ones . for their theoretical determination @xmath18-expansion [ 164 ] ,",
    "series expansion [ 165 ] , and monte - carlo simulations [ 166,167 ] were applied .",
    "moreover , the magnetic properties depend on several geometric features , which depend on the conditions during the growth .",
    "thus , the connection between experimental and theoretical results requires a detailed study of the dependence of physical quantities on the geometry of the systems .",
    "some specific properties have already been considered in theoretical works , such as the size and the lattice structure of small clusters [ 168,169 ] , the thickness of the film [ 170 ] and the roughness of one dimensional structures [ 171 ] , in particular , the role of surface imperfections , unavoidable in real materials , on the critical properties has been studied [ 172 - 175 ] . according to the harris criterion [ 176 ] , the relevance of the perturbationis connected to the sign of the specific heat exponent @xmath19 in the pure system .",
    "small amounts of disorder do not change the nature of the phase transition , if the corresponding pure system s specific heat exponent is negative .",
    "currently , there appears to be widespread consensus that critical exponents of bond disordered systems in the weak disorder limit are the same as those of the pure one [ 177 - 179 ] .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of bond disordered systems show logarithmic corrections in the behavior of the magnetizations which persist even in the strongly disordered regime [ 180,181 ] .",
    "however , in the @xmath20 spin diluted ising model a continuous variation of critical exponents with the spin density has been found [ 182 ] .",
    "a monte - carlo study [ 183 ] shows that the specific heat does not diverge at the critical point , at least when the concentration of dilution is sufficiently large ; the critical behavior of the magnetic susceptibility and the correlation length are consistent with the pure power - law behavior with the concentration dependent critical exponents . moreover , using monte carlo simulations , the site - diluted ising model in two dimensions has been studied [ 184 ] where it is found that such model belongs to the same universality class as the pure one , in spite of the strong logarithmic effects . besides",
    ", the surface critical behavior of the three - dimensional disordered semi - infinite ising ferromagnetic has been studied , using monte carlo simulations [ 185 ] ; it is found that for @xmath21 less than @xmath22 , the corresponding surface critical exponent is equal to the one of perfect surface [ 186 - 192 ] .    using the perturbative theory , harris [ 193 ]",
    "have studied the layering transitions at @xmath23 in the presence of a transverse field .",
    "the effect of finite size on such transitions has been studied , in thin film confined between parallel plates or walls , by nakanishi and fisher [ 194 ] using mean field theory and by bruno @xmath24 [ 195 ] taking into account the capillary condensation effect .",
    "the critical wetting transitions have been considered in systems with corrugated periodic walls [ 195 ] by using an effective hamiltonian study . by applying monte carlo simulations on thin ising films with competing walls , binder _",
    "[ 196 ] , found that occurring phase transitions belong to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model and found that the transition is shifted to a temperature just below the wetting transition of a semi - infinite fluid [ 197,198 ] .",
    "hanke @xmath24 [ 199 ] show that symmetry breaking fields give rise to nontrivial and long - ranged order parameter profiles for critical systems such as fluids , alloys , or magnets confined to wedges .",
    "the existence of the layering transitions for a film , with corrugated surface has been studied using mean field theory and monte carlo simulations [ 200 ] .",
    "it is found that the wetting temperature @xmath25 depends weakly on the surface corrugation degree for fixed values of the surface magnetic field .",
    "in addition , by applying a suitable effective interface model at liquid - vapor coexistence , rejmer @xmath24 [ 201 ] found a filling transition at which the height of the meniscus becomes macroscopically large while the planar walls of the wedge far away from its remain non - wet up to the wetting transition occurring at @xmath25 .",
    "they also showed that the discontinuous filling transition is accompanied by a pre - filling line extending into the vapor phase of the bulk phase diagram and describing a transition from a small to a large , but finite , meniscus height .",
    "much attention has been paid to the properties of layered structures consisting of alternating magnetic materials .",
    "the most commonly studied magnetic multilayers are those of ferromagnetic transition metal such as co or ni .",
    "many experiments have shown that the magnetization enhancement exists in multilayered films consisting of magnetic layers .",
    "it was found that ferromagnetic coupling can exist between magnetic layers . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", great interest has been paid to spin wave excitations as well as critical phenomena [ 202 - 215 ] .",
    "the study of thin films is partly motivated by the development of new growth and characterization techniques , but perhaps more so by the discovery of many exciting new properties , some quite unanticipated .",
    "these include , more recently , the discovery of enormous values of magnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers far exceeding those found in single layer films and the discovery of oscillatory interlayer coupling in transition metal multilayers .",
    "these experimental studies have motivated much theoretical work .",
    "however these developments are applied to a large extent powered by `` materials engineering '' and the ability to control and understand the growth of thin layers only a few atoms thick . however",
    ", many experimental studies have shown that the magnetization enhancement exists in multilayered films consisting of magnetic layers .",
    "the development of the molecular beam epitaxy technique and its application to the growth of thin metallic films has simulated renewed interest in thin film magnetism .",
    "the fabrication of thin metallic films has led to a surge of experimental activity [ 216 - 219 ] .",
    "more recently , the thickness dependence of the critical temperature of thin ising magnetic films having surface exchange enhancement has been studied by hong [ 71 ] and by aguilera - granja and moran lopez [ 220 ] within mean field approximation , by hai and li [ 221 ] and wiatrowski _",
    "[ 222 ] within an effective field treatment that accounts for the self - spin correlations .",
    "on the other hand , ferroelectric films can be described by an ising model in a transverse field [ 223 - 225 ] , and when the film becomes very thick , its properties are those of the semi - infinite ising system [ 108 - 110,226 ] .",
    "phase transitions in ising spin systems , driven entirely by quantum fluctuations , have been getting a lot of attention [ 227 ] .",
    "the simplest of such systems is the ising model in a transverse field which can be exactly solved in one dimension .",

    "the simplest of all random quantum systems is the random transverse ising model [ 234,235 ] .",
    "however , the random systems have been known to be dominated by rare regions .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced for random quantum systems at low or zero temperature far from critical points .",
    "indeed , griffiths [ 236 ] showed that the free energy is a non analytic function , because of rare regions .",
    "having found all the derivatives being finite , harris [ 237 ] concluded that this effect was very weak for classical systems .",
    "the spin-1 ising model with nearest - neighbor interactions , both bilinear and bi - quadratic , and with a crystal - field interaction was introduced by blume , emery , and griffiths ( beg)[104 ] to describe phase separation and superfluid ordering in @xmath33 mixtures . with vanishing bi - quadratic interactions the model",

    "<S> wetting phenomena plays an interesting role in the technological development of materials . recently , much attention has been directed to the study of magnetic solid films . </S>",
    "<S> to understand , theoretically , the effect of surface on wetting and layering transitions in these systems , we will give in this chapter a presentation of several relevant recent theoretical works realized on wetting and layering transitions in which we explain how the nature of surface can affect the behavior of wetting and layering transitions . </S>",
    "<S> using different spin systems models and different numerical and approximate methods such as mean field and effective field theories , real space renormalization group technique , transfer matrix method and monte - carlo simulations , it is found that the wetting and layering transitions depend on the nature of the surface magnetic field , the surface coupling strength , the surface crystal field , the geometry of surface , the in - homogeneity of substrate and the quantum fluctuations at the surface. indeed the layering transition temperature increases or decreases as a function of the thickness of the film depending on which the surface coupling is smaller or greater than a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> thus the wetting transition temperature can be greater or smaller than the layering temperature . in the case of variable surface crystal field </S>",
    "<S> an order - disorder layering reentrance appears with new critical exponents and multi - critical behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> wetting phenomena is also influenced by the curvature of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the intra - layers transitions appear under the effect of edge on the surface and/or corrugated surface . however , there exist an intra - layering surface temperature above which the surface and the intra - layer surface transitions occur . while the bulk layering and intra - layering transitions above an other finite temperature which is greater than the former one . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is not seen in the case of a perfect surface . beside this and under the corrugation effect </S>",
    "<S> , the pre - wetting phenomena and layering transitions occur at zero temperature , even in the case of a uniform magnetic field . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the wetting temperature depends strongly on the width of the corrugated - steps but weakly on its number . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuations introduce a new wetting transitions , namely the wetting , layering and roughening transverse fields . these fluctuations lead to the appearance of a sequence of layering sublimations transitions which occur before bulk melting above a critical transverse field which depends on temperature and/or chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the wetting temperature depends strongly on the randomness of the quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the chapter is organized as follows : section * 1 * is reserved to the introduction and definitions . in section </S>",
    "<S> * 2 * we present the relation between the nature of surface and wetting phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the surface geometry on wetting and layering transitions is presented in section * 3*. while quantum fluctuations effects are given in section * 4*. references are cited in section * 5*.    facult des sciences , dpartement de physique , laboratoire de magntisme et physique des hautes energies , b.p . 1014 , rabat , morocco . </S>"
