    "the manipulating bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in double wells provides us a versatile tool to explore the underlying physics in various nonlinear phenomena since almost each parameter can be tuned experimentally  @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies on the fascinating features of nonlinear effect , such as rabi oscillation  @xcite , josephson oscillation  @xcite , self trapping  @xcite , and measure synchronization  @xcite , in terms of becs in double wells .",
    "because the becs in double wells can be regarded as a two - level system , it is also expected either to be employed as a possible qubit or to simulate certain issues  @xcite in quantum computation and information . recently",
    ", the effect of decoherence of becs in double wells was investigated experimentally by means of interference between becs  @xcite and studied theoretically in terms of single - particle density matrix  @xcite . in order to exhibit",
    "the phenomena of decoherence , they  @xcite need to introduce the condensate - environment coupling because one - species bec in double wells were merely considered there . in comparison to one - species bec system , the two - species system can exhibit distinct decoherence phenomena due to the existence of the interspecies interaction .",
    "for example , the degree of coherence in a two - species system can evolve with time without the application of condensate - environment coupling , which is useful for one to get a system with desired degree of coherence .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to study the coherence dynamics of two - species becs in double wells .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of the inter - well tunneling strength on the coherence dynamics for a system of two - species becs in double wells . with the help of the reduced single - particle density matrix ,",
    "we show that such a system can exhibit decoherence phenomena without condensate - environment coupling .",
    "we also propose an experimental strategy to prepare a bec system with any desired degree of coherence through a time - dependent tunneling strength . in the next section , we model the two - species bec system and introduce the reduced single - particle density matrix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : decoherence ] , we study the time evolution of the degree of coherence for a time - independent inter - well tunneling strength . in sec .  [",
    "sec : contro ] , we investigate the time evolution of the degree of coherence for a rosen - zener form of tunneling strength and discuss the possibility of preparing a bec system with any degree of coherence .",
    "then we briefly give our conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "we consider a two - species bose - einstein condensate system confined in double wells .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) creates and annihilates a bosonic atom of species @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) in the @xmath7th well , respectively ; @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denotes the particle number operator of species @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "here the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the tunneling strengths of species @xmath5 and @xmath6 between the two wells , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the intraspecies interaction strengths , and @xmath14 is the interspecies interaction strength",
    ". the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamil ] ) can describe a bec mixture confined in a double well potential consisting of different atoms , or different isotopes , or different hyperfine states of the same kind of atom .",
    "the coherence dynamics of the above model has not been investigated although its dynamical properties , like josephson oscillation , stability and measure synchronization etc . , have been studied in earlier works @xcite . whereas , we know that the role of coherence of the system is very important since the first obstacle attempted to be avoided is the decoherence when a condensate in double wells is expected to be employed as a qubit .",
    "so the coherence dynamics of the model  ( [ eq : hamil ] ) is worthy of study .    as we know",
    ", under the semiclassical limit  @xcite , the dynamics of this system is conventionally studied in mean - field approach by replacing the expectation values of annihilators with complex numbers , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . with the help of heisenberg equation of motion for operators , one can easily get the dynamical equations for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these equations guarantee the conservation law @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the total particle number of species @xmath5 and @xmath6 . to simplify the calculation",
    ", one usually assumes @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then the aforementioned dynamical equations for @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be rewritten as , @xmath24 with    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . here",
    "the wave function @xmath29 refers to @xmath30 where the state @xmath31 or @xmath32 specifies the two different species while @xmath33 or @xmath34 specifies the two wells .",
    "note that the dynamical properties of the system can be determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynapure ] ) if the system is in a completely coherent state ( _ i.e. _ , a pure state ) .",
    "whereas , if the system is in a mixed state , the equation  ( [ eq : dynapure ] ) becomes insufficient .    in order to study the coherence dynamics of the system , we introduce the single - particle density matrix @xmath35 whose elements are @xmath36 . from this definition",
    ", we can see that , as a @xmath37 matrix , @xmath38 describes a pure state .",
    "their diagonal elements @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) represent the population of species @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) in the first and second well , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we only focus on the distribution of the total particle numbers in the two wells but not distinguish the particle species , so the system can be described by the reduced density matrix @xmath43 whose elements are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , the matrix @xmath48 can describe a mixed state .",
    "its diagonal elements @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent the total population probability in the first and second well , respectively . to investigate the coherence dynamics of the system , we can introduce the definition of degree of coherence according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath51 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : reducematrix ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherence ] ) , we can see that the time evolution of the degree of coherence depends on that of the elements @xmath52 of the single - particle density matrix @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath38 describes a pure state , the time evolution of @xmath52 can be determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynapure ] ) . thus one can solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynapure ] ) to get the evolution of @xmath53 and @xmath54 firstly , and then gives the time evolution of @xmath52 according to the definition of @xmath35 .",
    "then in the following sections , we will study the coherence dynamics of the system with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynapure ] ) .",
    "note that in the following calculations , we take @xmath55 for simplicity without losing the generality .",
    "we know that the degree of coherence does not change for an isolated bec system  @xcite . to study the effect of decoherence of bec system , several authors considered the condensate - environment coupling  @xcite . whereas , we will show that the degree of coherence of the two - species bec system in double wells can still change with time even without the condensate - environment coupling . here",
    "we consider the case of time - independent inter - well tunneling strength , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath56 is a constant in the calculation . due to the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynapure ] ) can not be analytically solved , we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynapure ] ) numerically to get the time evolution of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "then we give the time evolution of the degree of coherence with the help of the definition of @xmath38 and @xmath57 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherence ] ) .",
    "the corresponding results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] .",
    "( color online ) time evolution of the degree of coherence for different initial states .",
    "the parameters are @xmath58 ( a ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( b ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( c ) , and @xmath61 and @xmath60 ( d ) . , width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] , we plot the time evolution of the degree of coherence for different initial states and parameters .",
    "the initial states are @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the blue ( top ) line , @xmath65 and @xmath64 for the red ( middle ) line , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the black ( bottom ) line . from the fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] ( a ) , we can find that the degree of coherence of the two - species bec system in double wells does not change for any initial states when @xmath68 .",
    "that can be easily understood because this two - species system is equivalent to the one - species system once @xmath69 . and according to ref .",
    "( @xcite ) , the degree of coherence of the one - species bec system in double wells does not change without the condensate - environment coupling . so the result shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coherence ] ( a ) is reasonable .",
    "the figure  [ fig : coherence ] ( b ) shows that when @xmath70 , the degree of coherence does not change for the case of @xmath71 at the initial time , _",
    "i.e. _ , the initial population distributions of species @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the same , but that changes for the other initial states .",
    "note that for the case of @xmath70 , the time evolutions of species @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the same if @xmath71 at the initial time .",
    "so the degree of coherence does not change due to the two species having the same symmetry .",
    "additionally , from the fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] ( c ) and ( d ) , we can find that the degree of coherence changes for any initial states for the case of @xmath72 .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] ( c ) and ( d ) , we can see that for the same initial state , the variation tendency of the degree of coherence depends on the parameters of the system . in summary ,",
    "whether the degree of coherence can change with time depends on both the parameters and the initial states .",
    "so does the variation tendency of the degree of coherence .",
    "this fact indicates that one can control the degree of coherence without introducing the effect of environment , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in previous section , we show that the time evolution of the degree of coherence depends on the initial states and the parameters of the system , so one can change it by varying either the initial states or the parameters of the system . in the following , we will show how to control the degree of coherence through a rosen - zener form of @xmath56 , @xmath73 _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 increases from zero to its maximum value @xmath74 and then decreases to zero again in the end of the calculation . in the numerical calculation in this section ,",

    "[ fig : evorosen ] .",
    "we can see that the degree of coherence changes with time and can reach the maximum value @xmath78 at time @xmath79 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 depend on both the period @xmath80 and the maximum value @xmath74 of the inter - well tunneling strength . in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] , we plot the dependence of @xmath78 and @xmath81 on @xmath80 for a fixed @xmath74 in the left and right panel , respectively .",

    "[ fig : omega ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : tuj ] , we can see that the values of @xmath80 and @xmath74 affect the maximum value of the degree of coherence sensitively . in order to get a system with large value of degree of coherence",
    ", one must choose the form of @xmath56 with suitable period @xmath80 and maximum value @xmath74 .",
    "note that although one can get a system with large value of degree of coherence through tuning the value of @xmath80 and @xmath74 , it is difficult to control the time evolution of the degree of coherence due to the fact that the degree of coherence does not evolve periodically , which can be confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : evorosen ] . in order to overcome the aforementioned problem , we consider the following form of @xmath56 @xmath82 where @xmath81 can be obtained from fig .  [ fig : omega ] and fig .",

    "[ fig : evo ] . from this figure",
    ", we can find that the degree of coherence reaches its maximum value which is determined by the values of @xmath80 and @xmath74 , and then oscillates periodically at the following time . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynapure ] ) can be analytically solved for the case of @xmath84 , we can give the oscillation period in analytical method .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynapure ] ) , we obtain @xmath85 , and @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . substituting the expressions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 into the eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherence ] ) , we can get the oscillation period of the degree of coherence @xmath89 . for the parameters taken in fig .",
    "[ fig : evo ] , we find @xmath90 which is consistent with the numerical result . from the above discussion , we know that the degree of coherence oscillates periodically after time @xmath81 , and both the maximum value of the degree of coherence and the oscillation period can be changed by tuning the values of @xmath80 and @xmath74 .",
    "once the values of @xmath80 and @xmath74 are fixed , the time evolution of the degree of coherence is well defined , so that we can know the degree of coherence of the system at any time . then one can easily get a system with any desired degree of coherence through controlling the evolution time .",
    "in the above , we investigated the coherence dynamics for a system of two - species bose - einstein condensate in double wells . in mean field approximation , we studied the influence of the inter - well tunneling strength on the coherence features with the help of the reduced single - particle density matrix .",
    "since we need not distinguish particle species in the system , we only focused on the distribution of the total particle numbers in the two wells , which can be described by a 2@xmath912 reduced density matrix . after studying the time evolution of the degree of coherence for a time - independent inter - well tunneling strength , we found that the degree of coherence of the two - species bec system changes for some parameters and initial states even without the condensate - environment coupling , which differs from the case of refs .",
    "motivated by the fact that the variation tendency of the degree of coherence depends on both the parameters and the initial states of the system , we considered a system with a rosen - zener form of inter - well tunneling strength to control the degree of coherence .",
    "although its tendency is not periodical , the degree of coherence can reach a maximum value @xmath92 at time @xmath93 which are dependent of the period @xmath80 and the maximum value @xmath74 of the inter - well tunneling strength .",
    "the dependence of @xmath78 and @xmath81 on @xmath80 and @xmath74 we obtained is helpful for one to get a system with large value of degree of coherence utilizing a rosen - zener form of inter - well tunneling strength .",
    "we also gave a useful form of the inter - well tunneling strength for one to easily get a system with any degree of coherence by controlling the evolution time .",
