    "wave modes in the boundary region in the inner accretion disk are a likely source of the distinct narrow frequency bands of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) ( van der klis 2000 ) from neutron star sources in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "the dependence of qpo frequencies on accretion rate suggests that the observed qpos are connected with accretion disk modes .",
    "psaltis , belloni & van der klis ( 1999 ) showed the existence of correlations between the frequencies of different qpo bands extending over a wide span of frequencies .",
    "the same correlation encompasses black hole as well as white dwarf and neutron star sources .",
    "this strongly implies that the frequency bands are determined by the oscillation modes of the accretion disk .",
    "the nature of the compact object , whether it is a black hole , white dwarf or neutron star , probably plays a role in exciting the same disk modes through possibly different mechanisms in different types of compact sources .",
    "the qpo bands modifying the x - ray luminosity are likely to belong to the boundary region between the disk and the compact object . for magnetic neutron stars , this boundary region",
    "is shaped by the interaction of the disk with the magnetosphere .",
    "the region where the rotation deviates from keplerian flow is not necessarily very narrow ; this boundary zone may have a size as large as a few tenths of the inner disk radius .",
    "we shall therefore use the terms boundaryand transitionregion interchangeably .",
    "initial explorations of disk modes underlying qpo frequency bands from lmxbs were provided by alpar et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and alpar & yilmaz ( 1997 ) .",
    "the characteristics and possible excitation mechanisms of thin - disk oscillations were reviewed and discussed by kato ( 2001 ) . in many current models of qpos , especially those of neutron stars ,",
    "their frequencies are identified with test - particle frequencies ( stella , vietri & morsink 1999 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "most parts of an accretion disk , except , significantly , the transition regions at the inner boundary of the disk , are characterized by keplerian rotation rates to a very good approximation . at any radius beyond the transition region ,",
    "acoustic , magneto - acoustic and viscous corrections to the test - particle keplerian orbital frequency are negligible . in the outer disk regime for disks around neutron stars and white dwarfs ( and far enough from a central black hole ) , test - particle frequencies for radial and vertical perturbations of",
    "the orbit are degenerate with the keplerian orbital frequency .",
    "the degeneracy is removed if the effects of general relativity are important .",
    "a newtonian field of tidal or higher multi - pole structure would also lead to a split in the degeneracy .",
    "however , in newtonian gravity , distortions of stellar shape even for the most rapidly rotating neutron stars will not introduce a significant level of non - degeneracy between the frequencies of test - particle oscillations that is comparable to the difference between the observed qpo frequency bands . models employing the keplerian frequency have been relatively successful in interpreting qpo frequency correlations .",
    "the kepler ( test particle ) frequency interpretation has also been employed to place constraints on the masses and spins of compact objects .",
    "empirically , predictions based on test - particle frequencies applied to qpo frequency correlations deviate from observations at a level of about 10% .",
    "the keplerian frequency represents the basic imprint of rotation on all the dynamical responses of the disk .",
    "albeit simple , the identification of qpos with test - particle frequencies has a number of shortcomings .",
    "first , precisely in a boundary layer where qpos are expected to be excited , the dynamical frequencies of oscillations are not the test - particle frequencies . in the boundary layer , viscous and magnetic forces lead to deviation of orbital frequencies from keplerian test - particle frequencies ( see , e.g. , erkut & alpar 2004 ) .",
    "the resulting band of non - keplerian rotation frequencies entail viscous and acoustic response and couplings between adjacent rings of the disk fluid .",
    "hydrodynamic effects are therefore essential for an understanding of the frequency bands characterizing the boundary layer .",
    "in particular , the degeneracy of test - particle frequencies in the non - relativistic regime is lifted in the hydrodynamic boundary layer , where the radial epicyclic frequency is in fact larger than the orbital frequency . this simple observation ( alpar & psaltis 2005 ) has important consequences for the interpretation of khz qpo frequencies , in particular for the constraints on the neutron star mass - radius relation derived from khz qpos .",
    "second , test - particle frequencies do not distinguish between azimuthal sidebands . while kinematic models of qpos like the beat - frequency model involve one specific band of frequencies , say @xmath4 , a large number of sidebands , of frequencies @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the orbital frequency , are allowed by azimuthal symmetry .",
    "arguments as to why only one or two qpo bands are excited must involve choices imposed by the symmetries of the interaction between the magnetosphere and the accretion disk boundary , leading to resonances with particular frequencies at one or more radial regions in the disk . without resonances , test - particle frequency spectra present no distinction between the modes .",
    "the realistic hydrodynamic modes may , in some parameter ranges , distinguish between both fundamental modes and all their azimuthal sidebands through the different growth or decay rates of these modes , _ even in the case of free oscillations_. a reduction of the number of relevant ( easily excitable ) modes of free oscillations is certainly an important task for an understanding of accretion disks around neutron stars , white dwarfs and black holes . in the case of black holes ,",
    "this classification of free hydrodynamic modes in terms of their growth rates is even more important as resonant excitation by the black hole is not available .    in this paper , we study the global modes of free oscillations at some position @xmath6 in the inner disk - boundary or transition region by analyzing the perturbed dynamical equations of a hydrodynamic disk , including pressure gradients , viscous and magnetic stresses .",
    "we consider the case of a disk around a neutron star with a magnetosphere .",
    "the neutron star is taken to be a _",
    "slow rotator _ : the star s rotation rate is less than the value of the keplerian rotation rate at the inner radius of the disk ; @xmath7 . the actual rotation rate of the disk is set by the boundary condition @xmath8 .",
    "thus in the steady state solutions for the disk , the rotation rate at the inner edge of the disk and in the transition region beyond is sub - keplerian .",
    "the innermost disk radius @xmath9 determines the disk magnetosphere interface which may be subject to magnetic rayleigh - taylor or interchange instabilities .",
    "this instability operates mainly at the disk - magnetosphere interface because of the sharp density contrast across the radius @xmath10 .",
    "the inner disk region for @xmath11 consists of a non - keplerian boundary region that joins the outer keplerian disk with a continuous density distribution . as we will see in",
    "  [ ehdfom ] , the surface density profile throughout the non - keplerian boundary region increases with decreasing radii .",
    "thus , our boundary region is not subject to interchange - like instabilities .",
    "the free oscillation modes we explore by perturbing a steady state solution embody information about the stability of the disk through their growth or decay rates .",
    "growing modes will provide a clue as to the origin of the qpo frequency bands , which could be excited by resonant forcing of the disk by time dependent interactions with the star s magnetosphere .",
    "we find , as expected , that growth or decay rates are determined by the dynamical effects of viscosity , with an additional dependence on the sound speed and the density and rotation - rate profiles in the non - keplerian boundary region",
    ". for some boundary region parameters , not all fundamental modes of free oscillations and not all azimuthal sidebands grow , and among the growing modes the growth rates differ . for other choices of boundary region parameters the growth rates of all sidebands",
    "are similar .",
    "the frequencies of the modes differ from test - particle frequencies by amounts that can be several times larger than the corresponding qpo width .",
    "most importantly , for a reasonable set of accretion disk parameters , we can show that only a certain few of the hydrodynamic free oscillation modes will grow , and that the frequency bands of these oscillations can be associated with the observed frequency bands .",
    "the nature of free oscillation modes in the boundary region depends on whether the neutron star is rotating at a rate slower or faster than the rotation rates prevailing in the inner boundary of the disk . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the more common and straightforward case of _ slow rotators _ , the case when the neutron star rotation rate @xmath12 is less than @xmath13 , the kepler rotation rate at some representative inner disk radius @xmath9 .",
    "an investigation of _ forced _ resonant excitation of these prevalent modes , and the comparison and association with observed qpo bands will follow in a subsequent paper .    ",
    "2 lays out the basic assumptions and equations ,   3 displays the mode analysis for the free oscillations , including a discussion of hydrodynamic effects , frequency bands , and growth rates . in ",
    "4 , we discuss the results and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider the excitation of oscillations in a geometrically thin disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we write the continuity and the radial and angular momentum equations in cylindrical coordinates , integrated vertically over the disk thickness , as @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the half - thickness of the disk , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the radial and azimuthal components of the velocity field in the disk , @xmath20 is the gravitational potential , @xmath21 is the surface mass density , @xmath22 is the vertically integrated thermal pressure , @xmath23 is the mass density , @xmath24 is the sum of the gas and radiation pressures , and @xmath25 are the vertically averaged sums of the magnetic and viscous forces per unit mass , and the subscript @xmath26 stands for the @xmath6 or @xmath27 component of the force .",
    "we only consider the @xmath28-component of the viscous force as the dominant shear stress between adjacent layers , because of our assumption that the disk is geometrically thin ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "we write the sum of the viscous and large - scale magnetic forces ( per unit mass ) in the radial and azimuthal directions as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the steady , axisymmetric , equilibrium state obeys @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the constant mass - inflow rate , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath2 is the angular velocity of the disk plasma , and @xmath37^{1/2}$ ] is the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "we introduce perturbations to this axisymmetric fluid distribution and use the subscripts 0  and 1  to denote the equilibrium and perturbed states , respectively .",
    "the linearized perturbation equations follow from equations ( [ avcnt])([avazm ] ) as @xmath38 + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial } { % \\partial \\phi } ( \\sigma _ { 0}v_{\\phi 1})=0 ,   \\label{lcnt}\\]]@xmath39and @xmath40where @xmath41 is the lagrangian derivative following the motion of the fluid in the azimuthal direction .    in the following ,",
    "we study perturbations varying on timescales shorter than the thermal timescale and thus expect that there is no energy exchange between adjacent fluid elements . in this case , the fluid elements respond adiabatically to density and pressure perturbations and , at the same time , the disk thickness @xmath17 , which is determined by vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , responds to the change of pressure . in general , we can write ( stehle & spruit 1999 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the index of a polytropic equation of state .",
    "the terms in the last parenthesis is of order unity . because we will not be calculating explicitly changes in the vertical equilibrium during the oscillations",
    ", we will set the last term to unity .",
    "therefore , we will be studying effectively isothermal modes .",
    "we consider long wavelength perturbations to analyze the lowest order normal modes extending globally over the radial distance scale @xmath44 of the disk .",
    "for the stability of such global modes the effect of cylindrical geometry and of the structure of the unperturbed disk state must be taken into account .",
    "we perform a local mode analysis .",
    "our approach differs from the usual local mode analysis of short - wavelength perturbations of radial dependence @xmath45 in a wkb approximation .",
    "consideration of modes with radial wavenumbers would be appropriate for the analysis of local disk modes in the short wavelength regime .",
    "instead , we study the stability of the global disk modes at each particular radius @xmath6 in the boundary layer . in this region ,",
    "the unperturbed disk quantities such as the surface density @xmath46 and the rotation rate @xmath2 change on a length scale @xmath47 . since the variation of the global long wavelength perturbations has a much longer range @xmath48 in the radial direction , we write equations  ( [ lcnt])([liaz ] ) at any particular radius @xmath6 in dimensionless form , neglecting the @xmath6-dependence of the perturbations : @xmath49@xmath50@xmath51here , @xmath52 is the dimensionless density perturbation , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the dimensionless velocity perturbations , @xmath55 are the force perturbations in units of frequency , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the typical frequencies associated with the radial accretion and the effective sound speed @xmath58 , respectively .",

    "we note that in these approximate expressions to leading order in @xmath93 the imaginary parts have no dependence on @xmath88 .",

    "any distinction between the free oscillation modes arises only in a regime in which acoustic and viscous hydrodynamic effects are important .",
    "it is possible to check the consistency of our stability analysis using equations ( [ ob0i ] ) , ( [ ou0i ] ) , ( [ obmi ] ) , and ( [ oumi ] ) in the limit of non - magnetic local modes for which the radial gradient in the background surface density at any given location is negligible , that is , @xmath97 .",

    "this justifies , to zeroth order , the identification of the observed qpo frequencies with frequencies of test particles in kinematic models of the qpos .",
    "for example , in the sonic - point model ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , the higher khz qpo would be the @xmath106 mode at the sonic radius . in the relativistic precession model ( stella et al .",
    "1999 ) , the two high - frequency qpos would be the @xmath107 and @xmath108 modes .    in the absence of external forcing ,",
    "high - frequency modes in an accretion disk can be excited only in the presence of viscosity .",
    "this is a well - known result , discussed in detail by kato ( 2001 ) . because the disk can not respond thermally at the high - frequencies of interest here",
    ", viscosity can excite the modes only through its dynamical effect ( mechanism ii in kato 2001 ) and not through its thermal effect ( mechanism i in kato 2001 ) .",
    "thus free oscillation modes in the accretion disk modes can have positive growth rates only if @xmath109 is not zero , i.e. , through the effect of viscosity , and , hence , only if the hydrodynamic contributions to their frequencies are operative .",
    "indeed , all models of hydrodynamic accretion disk modes show that non - negligible hydrodynamic corrections modify the test - particle frequencies of growing modes ( see , e.g. , wagoner 1999 ; kato 2001 ; psaltis & norman 2000 ) .",
    "we estimate the expected hydrodynamic corrections to the oscillatory mode frequencies typically identified with high - frequency qpos using the scaling of the viscous and thermal frequencies in an alpha disk , i.e. , @xmath110 and @xmath111 the fractional hydrodynamic correction to , e.g. , the @xmath112\\simeq \\kappa -\\omega $ ] mode is determined by the acoustic response provided that @xmath113 is not close to unity : @xmath114    the growth rate of the same modes is @xmath115 and hence the quality factor @xmath116 of the corresponding qpo will be at most @xmath117 and the resulting width of the qpo will be @xmath118 . combining equations  ( [ eq : corr ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) we obtain for the hydrodynamic correction to the mode frequency in units of the width of the corresponding qpo the relation @xmath119 it is clear from this expression that , even for relatively large values of the parameter @xmath120 , the qpos will have frequencies that are distinct from the corresponding test - particle frequencies by amounts that are several times larger than the qpo widths .",
    "the growth rates of free oscillation modes are determined by a number of parameters characterizing the boundary region in the inner disk . in this region , the angular velocity of the disk matter",
    "makes a transition from the keplerian rotation to match the stellar rotation rate .",
    "our analysis depends on the local values of these parameters at any particular radius @xmath6 within this transition or boundary region .",
    "the main parameters are the ratio of the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath0 to the orbital angular frequency @xmath121 , the radial surface - density profile @xmath60 ( equation [ bet ] ) , @xmath122 , the ratio of the radial drift velocity to the sound speed , and @xmath79 , the inverse timescale or the typical frequency associated with the sound speed in units of the angular velocity . in this section",

    "however , once we specify the kinematic viscosity as in equation ( [ vscty ] ) , we can relate the surface density profile ( see equation [ bet ] ) , using equations ( [ vscty ] ) and ( [ vidv ] ) , to the orbital frequency profile and other parameters of the boundary region through @xmath139 the first two terms , which we delineate as @xmath140 characterize each of the boundary region models developed in erkut & alpar ( 2004 ) , with values in the range @xmath141 .",

    "as @xmath183 in a boundary layer , we find @xmath184 as observed for the relatively slow rotators among the neutron - star lmxbs that exhibit khz qpos .",
    "we have studied the global hydrodynamic modes of long wavelength in the boundary or transition region of viscous accretion disks as a possible source of khz qpos in neutron - star lmxbs .",

    "our local treatment takes account of the local effects of the global disk parameters on the excitation of hydrodynamic free oscillations .",
    "we find that the frequencies and growth rates of the modes are mainly determined by global disk parameters such as @xmath185 , the ratio of the radial epicyclic frequency to the orbital frequency , the radial surface - density profile @xmath60 , @xmath186 , the ratio of the radial drift velocity to the sound speed , and @xmath79 , the ratio of the sound speed to the azimuthal velocity .",
    "the local values of @xmath187 and @xmath60 directly follow from the global solution for the rotational dynamics of a boundary - transition region model . the parameters @xmath188 and @xmath143 depend additionally on the particular viscosity prescription and the details of the structure of accretion flow in the inner disk .",
    "the hydrodynamic effects on the frequencies and growth rates of the modes are reflected by the parameters @xmath188 and @xmath79 .",
    "we have found that the growth rates of different modes for a given azimuthal wavenumber @xmath88 differ significantly when the hydrodynamic corrections are sufficiently large , i.e. @xmath189 and @xmath190 . in this regime ,",
    "the growing mode frequencies significantly exceed test - particle frequencies for a plausible range of @xmath79 at any particular radius within the boundary region .",
    "this is because the effect of hydrodynamic corrections on the growth rates of the modes is expected to be strong in a magnetic boundary layer or transition zone as discussed in   3.2 .",
    "in the limit of small hydrodynamic corrections , i.e. @xmath191 and @xmath192 , the eigenmodes have test - particle frequencies with negligible growth rates .",
    "our analysis shows that taking account of hydrodynamic effects has an important outcome : the frequencies of the growing modes gain higher values above test - particle frequencies as their growth rates increase for larger hydrodynamic corrections .    throughout the boundary region",

    "the difference frequency between successive bands of growing modes is @xmath197 as observed for the relatively slowly rotating neutron stars in lmxbs that show khz qpos (   3.2 ) . in a boundary layer or transition region , the orbital frequency of the disk matter",
    "is close to the rotation frequency of the star ( @xmath198 ) . as @xmath199",
    ", the separation between consecutive mode frequencies is always related to the spin frequency of the neutron star .",
    "this is the result of the boundary condition imposed by the rotating magnetosphere on the innermost disk .",
    "the modes of the test - particle frequencies @xmath200 and @xmath201 were originally proposed by alpar & psaltis ( 2005 ) to be associated with the upper and lower khz qpos observed in neutron - star lmxbs .",
    "the frequency separation between the higher and lower - frequency khz qpo peaks decreases by a few tens of hz as both qpo frequencies increase by hundreds of hz in a range of @xmath202 hz per source in all observed sources , namely , sco  x-1 , 4u  @xmath203 , 4u  @xmath204 and 4u  @xmath205 ( van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "this pair of frequencies satisfies the observed behavior that the difference frequency @xmath206 between two khz qpos decreases as both frequencies increase . according to our present analysis",
    ", the pairs of observed khz qpo bands could be either @xmath207 and @xmath208 or @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively , since the identification of the observed qpos with @xmath211 and @xmath209 also meets the observed condition that @xmath206 decreases when both qpo frequencies increase .",
    "the growth rates of free oscillations produce a wide spectrum of sidebands , @xmath212 , some of which fall in the range of observed power spectra .",
    "the reduction to only two of khz qpo bands as observed in neutron star sources must therefore be a product of forced oscillations , resonances , and boundary conditions .",
    "the role of forced oscillations and resonances in the excitation of particular modes will be discussed in future work .",
    "we find that the fastest growing modes with frequency branches @xmath0 and @xmath213 are excited near the disk radius @xmath175 , where the orbital frequency is maximum . in the boundary layer , the loss of centrifugal support near @xmath169 leads to some radial acceleration of the disk matter .",
    "the subsequent rise in the radial drift velocity of the disk matter is accompanied by a sudden drop in the surface density as the vertically integrated dynamical viscosity is minimized ( see   3.2 ) .",
    "this picture is common to all boundary layers or transition zones for which magnetic braking is efficient ( see erkut & alpar 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , independent of the boundary conditions and the magnetic field configuration in the boundary region , there exists a specific disk radius where the hydrodynamical background quantities such as the surface density @xmath46 and the radial drift velocity @xmath214 change dramatically .",
    "the steepness in the change of the surface density in the radial direction is reflected through the parameter @xmath60 ( see equation [ bet ] ) .",
    "the sign and magnitude of @xmath60 ( the surface density profile in the disk ) control whether the free oscillation modes will grow or decay .",
    "we see that the modes of frequency bands @xmath0 and @xmath213 can be excited with the largest growth rates only for the disk radii @xmath215 , where @xmath60 is minimum and @xmath2 is maximum ( see   3.2 for the range of @xmath60 ) .",
    "the inverse timescale , @xmath216 , associated with radial accretion also obtains its highest value near the same radii yielding the maximum growth rates in the accretion disk .",
    "the boundary layers with sub - keplerian rotation rates are usually expected to be realized in the innermost regions of accretion disks around _",
    "slow rotators_. for a _ slow rotator _",
    ", the kepler rotation rate at the inner disk radius @xmath217 prevails over the stellar rotation rate @xmath218 . as we have illustrated in   3.2 , the difference frequency between two consecutive bands of growing modes in the boundary region is close to the spin frequency of the neutron star ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "this result agrees with the khz qpo observations of the relatively slow rotators with spin frequencies below @xmath220  hz in neutron - star lmxbs . in these sources , for example , in 4u  @xmath204 , the lower khz qpo frequencies increase from 600 to 900 hz and the upper khz qpo frequencies increase from 950 to 1200 hz , while the difference between the two observed khz qpo frequency bands decreases slightly , of the order of 10 hz , while remaining still commensurate with the spin frequency of the neutron star ( mndez & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "a second class of khz qpo sources , such as the sources ks  @xmath221 , aql  x-1 , 4u  @xmath222 , which have spin frequencies above @xmath223  hz is usually depicted as _ fast rotators _ ( see wijnands et al .",
    "in this second class of sources , for example in 4u  @xmath222 , the lower khz qpo frequencies increase from 900 to 950 hz and the upper khz qpo frequencies increase from 1150 to 1190 hz , while the difference between the two observed khz qpo frequency bands again decreases by amounts of the order of 10 hz ( see van der klis 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the frequency separation between the khz qpos is close to half the spin frequency of the neutron star if it is a _ fast rotator_. the emergence of two seemingly different classes of neutron - star lmxbs could be related to whether the rotation rate of the neutron star is less or greater than that of the inner disk matter .",
    "it is probable that @xmath224 for the relatively fast rotating neutron star sources for which the difference frequency between twin qpo peaks is @xmath225 .",
    "recent work by mndez & belloni ( 2007 ) actually suggests a more continuous distribution between @xmath197 and @xmath226 .",
