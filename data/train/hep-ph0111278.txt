    "the cure to this problem is model dependent , and proceeds either through the inclusion of non - trivial form factors which depend on the hadronic physics governing the @xmath167 transition or , in a more modern chpt language , the inclusion of local counter - terms to render the result finite .",

    "indeed , in terms of the branching ratio @xmath266 one gets @xmath267 , @xmath268 @xcite , whereas the experimental value coming from the pdg is @xmath269 @xcite , favoring the one - loop result , while a recent measurement at the cmd-2 detector reports @xcite @xmath270 , which seems to favor the tree - level result , although being compatible with the one - loop prediction",
    ".      the @xmath272 decay has a long story , nicely reviewed in ref.@xcite , and furnish a stringent test of chpt .",
    "it is also discussed by bijnens @xcite . at lowest order in chpt ,",
    "one predicts a vanishing @xmath273 decay width contrasting with the measured value @xcite  ev was reported by nefkens @xcite during this workshop . ] @xmath274 higher orders in chpt allow to obtain predictions not far from this value thanks to a rather complicated interplay among loop corrections and counterterms .",
    "the amplitude for the decay @xmath275 can be written in the following form @xmath276 where @xmath277 and @xmath152 are the two kinematically allowed amplitudes @xmath278 their coefficients @xmath279 refer to the tree ",
    "level and counter  term contributions , whereas @xmath280 , with @xmath281 or @xmath282 , refer to the contributions from pion or kaon loops .",
    "the sum extends from the lowest order terms , @xmath283 , to higher ones @xmath284 we also define @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 . with",
    "these conventions fixed we now proceed to review the different contributions to the amplitude @xmath289 .",
    "as previously stated , there is no lowest order @xmath36 contribution from @xmath290 to the @xmath291 amplitude , i.e. @xmath292 , as can be immediately seen from eqs.([l2lluis ] ) and ( [ covder ] ) with @xmath42=0 $ ] for neutral pseudoscalars .    at next order ,",
    "@xmath53 , the tree  level amplitude coming from eq.([l4 ] ) is also zero , @xmath293 .",
    "this is clearly the case for the wz ",
    "term contributing only to anomalous processes and also for the counter - terms in eq.([l4 ] ) .",
    "indeed , photon couplings are generated either by covariant derivatives or by @xmath56 terms like the two terms proportional to @xmath294 ( for one photon ) and to @xmath295 ( for two photons ) in ( [ l4 ] ) .",
    "but the vanishing of @xmath42 $ ] when only neutral @xmath48 and @xmath0 are involved is enough to guarantee a null contribution in all cases @xcite .",
    "this absence of counter - terms implies that loop contributions at this order can not be divergent .",
    "they contain two vertices of the lagrangian @xmath290 and a ( charged ) pion or kaon loop .",
    "one obtains @xmath296 and the finite expressions @xcite @xmath297 with ( @xmath298 ) @xmath299 the small correction to @xmath300 proportional to @xmath51 has been ignored .    if one further introduces the numerical values @xmath25 , @xmath51 as in eq.([tadpole ] ) and the @xmath0 mass , one obtains the loop contributions up to @xmath53 to the @xmath301 width @xmath302 more than two orders of magnitude below the measured width ( [ width ] ) .",
    "the pion loop contribution is small due to the g ",
    "parity violation in the vertex @xmath303 , which makes the amplitude proportional to @xmath244 or @xmath51 as seen in eq.([op4 ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the g  parity conserving kaon loops is also small because the loop ",
    "integration introduces the function @xmath304 with a large denominator in our case with @xmath305 .",
    "further contributions are required .",
    "this was noted independently by ecker et al .",
    ", ref.@xcite .",
    "corrections of @xmath33 were partially considered in @xcite in terms of resonance saturation for counter - terms including vectors as well as the scalar @xmath306 and tensor @xmath307 resonances .",
    "such tree - level contributions were argued to dominate over one - loop corrections of the same order using g - parity suppression arguments in the case of pion loops , and the smallness of the one - loop functions appearing in kaon loops .",
    "the corresponding result was @xmath308    at @xmath309 more counter - terms appear and a new type of loop ",
    "correction becomes potentially important .",
    "since the counter - term contributions are assumed to be resonance dominated one can simply take the full vmd amplitude , @xmath310 a - \\big[\\sd{1\\over m_v^2-t } + \\sd{1 \\over m_v^2-u}\\big ] b \\right\\},\\ ] ] as an `` all  order '' estimate , i.e. , at @xmath33 and higher .",
    "this represents a substantial increase to the rate , namely , @xmath311 in reasonable agreement with older vmd estimates @xcite .",
    "analogous @xmath306 and @xmath307 contributions are expected to slightly modify this result as discussed above .",
    "a new type of loop effects looks _ a priori _ more interesting . taking two vertices from the anomalous",
    "@xmath312 implies a non  anomalous one  loop correction of @xmath309 .",
    "indeed , pion loops are no longer suppressed because there is no g ",
    "parity violation in the @xmath313 and @xmath314 vertices and moreover the kaon loop suppression due to the function @xmath315 in eq.([h ] ) does not occur .",
    "however , one easily obtains @xmath316 to be compared with @xmath317 in eq.([gammaop4 ] ) .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath318 comes from the absorptive part of the amplitude , which is much larger than that of the pion loop in @xmath317 as expected .",
    "a convenient way of presenting the chpt predictions for @xmath319 consists in summing up all the contributions which are not negligible and present no sign ambiguities , i.e. , the non  anomalous pion and kaon loops at @xmath53 , eq.([op4 ] ) , the corresponding loops at @xmath309 with two wz vertices , and the `` all  order '' sum of vmd counter - terms in eq.([mvmd ] ) .",
    "this implies @xcite @xmath320 where the error comes essentially from the sign ambiguity in the interference of the @xmath306 and @xmath307 resonances respect to the vector dominated contribution , and the lack of knowledge of higher order contributions .",
    "this chpt result is in agreement with related work by picciotto @xcite ( performed also in the same chpt context ) and ng and peters @xcite ( who estimated the dominant vmd contribution ) .",
    "more phenomenological predictions using constituent quark models exist .",
    "good agreement with the experimental result can be reached with constituent quark masses of @xmath321 for up and down quarks @xcite .",
    "measures of the photon energy and/or the two - photon invariant mass spectra , which have different shapes for different models , would help to elucidate the best theoretical description for @xmath322 decay .",
    "the rare decays @xmath324 have not yet been observed .",
    "they can occur at second order of the e.m .",
    "interaction without @xmath9 violation , through the chain @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude is given by forcing the two intermediate photons to be on  shell and requires good knowledge of the @xmath327 decay which unfortunately is not the case at the moment , as we discussed in the preceding subsection .",
    "in addition , the real part of the amplitude diverges unless one introduces suitable form factors for the off  shell photons that regularizes the loop integration at expenses of making it model dependent .",
    "some years ago , cheng @xcite computed the @xmath328 decay in the limit @xmath329 using a vmd model .",
    "he found @xmath330 .",
    "more recently , ng and peters @xcite have analyzed the @xmath331 channel , where the muon mass can not be neglected . making also use of vmd ( and also considering the @xmath306 exchange in the two photon intermediate state )",
    "they give approximate analytical expressions for the imaginary part of the @xmath332 amplitudes and for the energy spectrum of the pion .",
    "the following unitarity bounds were obtained @xmath333 the inclusion of the @xmath306 exchange affects only the muon channel , leading to @xmath334 ( @xmath335 ) @xmath336 for constructive ( destructive ) interference .",
    "they estimated the dispersive part of the amplitude by means of an _ ad hoc _ cutoff of @xmath337 to be @xmath338 , suggesting that the rate can not be much greater than the unitarity bound .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results obtained by heiliger and sehgal @xcite using a dispersive treatment for the similar processes @xmath339 and @xmath340 , @xmath341 , @xmath342 .",
    "0.5truecm      the @xmath248 process has been analyzed in the chpt framework @xcite . at lowest order ,",
    "the amplitude is dominated by pure bremsstrahlung and is thus closely related to the isospin violating @xmath343 amplitude . at @xmath53 ,",
    "apart from the correction to the inner bremsstrahlung contribution , a new structure dependent ( or direct emission ) contribution appears , which does not vanish in the isospin limit .",
    "this makes the process interesting since it carries new information not accessible from @xmath243 .",
    "both contributions were estimated in @xcite using an _ ad hoc _ parametrization of the @xmath343 amplitude .",
    "it essentially consists in approximating the amplitude by its value at the center of the dalitz plot , using @xmath344 ; @xmath345 , value that differs from @xmath346 and takes into account the phenomenological @xmath12 mixing for radiative processes , and using the enhancement of the amplitude through the correction of dashen s theorem .",
    "this analysis was performed considering only the isospin conserving kaon loop contribution , which was expected to be dominant .",
    "next order contributions were also estimated using vmd saturation hypothesis , in a similar way as in the @xmath4 chpt prediction .",
    "the conclusion reached was that the inner bremsstrahlung amplitude strongly dominates .",
    "several technical points were refined and improved in @xcite .",
    "mainly , a better treatment of the low s theorem for the inner bremsstrahlung amplitude and the inclusion of the pion - loops leads to the result @xmath347 .",
    "the contribution of the structure dependent contribution to the above result turns out to be a tiny @xmath348 .",
    "in this section we comment on the anomalous @xmath18 decays .",
    "they were first discussed at tree - level in chpt in ref.@xcite .",
    "the next order contributions to the neutral channel were computed in @xcite .",
    "being multi - body decays , several contributions appear .",
    "in fact , the amplitude for the neutral channel , for instance , can be written as @xcite @xmath349 the first term proceeds through the chain @xmath350 with a subsequent anomalous @xmath90 transition .",
    "it thus depends on the non - anomalous and isospin breaking @xmath7 amplitude , discussed in section [ eta3pi ] .",
    "actually , the avaliable phase space suggests that a simplified treatment of the @xmath7 , along the lines described in the previous section [ eta3pigamma ] is possible .",
    "the second contribution proceeds through the isospin conserving decay chain @xmath351 and turns to vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "the third term includes one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) one - loop diagrams , with an @xmath352 vertex from the wz lagrangian , followed by @xmath353 rescattering .",
    "the last vmd contribution represents an estimate of higher - order contributions .",
    "the analysis of reference @xcite can be summarized in the diphoton mass spectrum of fig.1 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that this partial decay width is dominated by the pion - pole in @xmath7 .    in @xcite the charged @xmath354 channel",
    "was also discussed up to @xmath33 .",
    "the interest of this process from the chpt point of view is masked by the dynamics of the processes @xmath355 with an additional radiative photon , and @xmath343 with a subsequent @xmath90 decay .",
