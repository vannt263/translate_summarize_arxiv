    "one of the most important factors supporting progress in the miniaturization of computers and other electronic devices is the continued exponential increase in the density of data storage.@xcite currently , designs are being considered for magnetic recording devices that have areal data densities of the order of terabits/@xmath0  several orders of magnitude more than only a decade ago . at such densities , the size of the recording bit approaches the superparamagnetic limit , where thermal fluctuations seriously degrade the stability of the magnetization.@xcite however , current industry standards demand that bits should retain 95% of their magnetization over a period of ten years.@xcite furthermore , subnanosecond magnetization - switching times are required to achieve acceptable read / write rates .",
    "one suggested method to fulfill these requirements is to use ultrathin , perpendicularly magnetized films of very high - coercivity materials , such as fept ( coercive field about 50  koe ) , or single - particle bits that are expected to have even higher coercivities.@xcite however , such high coercive fields at room temperature are beyond what is achievable by modern write heads , which are limited to about 17  koe.@xcite a method suggested to overcome this problem is to exploit the temperature dependence of the coercivity through heat - assisted magnetization reversal or hamr ( aka .",
    "thermally assisted magnetization reversal or tamr).@xcite this is accomplished by increasing the temperature of the recording area to a value close to , or above , the curie temperature of the medium via a localized heat source , such as a laser.@xcite due to the temperature dependence of the coercivity , the magnitude of the required switching field is lowered at the elevated temperature , relaxing the requirements for the write head .",
    "an important consideration for the implementation of the hamr technique is to keep the heat input as low and as tightly focused as possible , limiting energy transfer to neighboring recording bits . in order to reach the desired high data densities ,",
    "the laser spot must have a diameter less than 50  nm , much smaller than the wavelength .",
    "this can be achieved using near - field optics , a technology which currently is the objective of vigorous research and development.@xcite    despite their simplicity , two - dimensional kinetic ising models have been shown to be useful for studying magnetization switching in ultrathin films with strong anisotropy.@xcite theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work has shown that the equilibrium phase transition in such films belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the dynamics of magnetization switching in ultrathin , perpendicularly magnetized films has been studied using magneto - optical microscopies in combination with monte carlo simulations of ising - like models by , among others , kirilyuk et al .",
    "@xcite and robb et al.@xcite systems that have been found to have strong ising character include fe sesquilayers@xcite and ultrathin films of co,@xcite co / pd,@xcite and co / pt.@xcite the strong anisotropy in such systems limits the effects of transverse spin dynamics and ensures that local spin reversals are thermally activated .",
    "the extreme thinness of the films strongly reduce the demagnetization effects to which films with out - of plane magnetization are otherwise subject.@xcite for detailed reviews of experimental and simulational studies of magnetization switching in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetization , see refs .   .    in the present paper we use a two - dimensional ising ferromagnet to model the hamr process by kinetic monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ,",
    "demonstrating enhanced nucleation of the switched magnetization state in the heated area . for simplicity and computational economy",
    ", we envisage an experimental setup slightly different from others previously reported in the literature.@xcite it most closely resembles the optical - dominant setup shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) of ref .  .",
    "the recording medium is placed in a constant write field that is too weak to cause significant switching on an acceptable time scale , and it is heated at its center by a transient heat pulse . at a fixed superheating temperature we show that the relative speed - up of the magnetization switching , compared to the constant - temperature case , depends nonmonotonically on the magnitude of the applied field .",
    "this relative speed - up shows a pronounced maximum at an intermediate value of the applied field .",
    "we give a physical explanation for this effect , based on the nucleation theory of magnetization switching in finite - sized systems.@xcite as magnetization switching is a special case of the decay of a metastable phase ( i.e. , the medium in its state of magnetization opposite to the applied field),@xcite this analysis is of general physical interest beyond the specific technological application discussed here .",

    "pinning of interfaces for very weak applied field,@xcite as well as heterogeneous nucleation of spin reversal@xcite are neglected .",
    "we further exclude demagnetizing effects , which are very weak for ultrathin films@xcite and thus cause no qualitative changes in monte carlo simulations of the switching process.@xcite    the stochastic spin dynamic is given by the single - spin flip metropolis algorithm with transition probability@xcite @xmath7 \\ ; , \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the energy change that would result from acceptance of the proposed spin flip . the temperature , @xmath9 , is given in energy units ( i.e. , boltzmann s constant",

    ", we use a temperature profile given by a time - dependent , gaussian solution of a one - dimensional diffusion equation .",
    "the profile is centered on the mid - line of the ising lattice , @xmath17 , and each spin in the @xmath18th column of the lattice has the temperature @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the maximum of the temperature pulse , which is attained at @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the peak temperature is @xmath22 .",

    "( equation  [ eq : temp ] most likely underestimates the speed of decay of the temperature pulse as it ignores heat conduction into the substrate . )",
    "figure  [ fig : pulse ] displays the temperature of each column at eight times between @xmath27 and 500  mcss . by first promoting the center - most lattice sites to temperatures above @xmath28 before relaxing them back to @xmath29 according to eq .",

    "after the completion of this switching process , almost all spins will be oriented up , @xmath30 .",
    "we define the switching time @xmath31 as the time until the system first reaches a magnetization per spin , @xmath32 of zero or greater .",
    "we first performed a preliminary study to confirm that magnetization switching can be induced by the temperature profile , given the parameters used in eq .",

    "[ fig : snap ] we display the configuration of the system at six times between @xmath27 and 125  mcss during this run .",
    "as expected , the switching begins near the center line of the system , where the temperature is above critical , and propagates outward .",
    "we note a strong similarity of the simulated magnetization configurations to experimental images of ultrathin , strongly anisotropic films undergoing magnetization reversal , such as figs .  3 , 4 , and 8 of ref .   and",
    "fig .  2 of ref .",
    "this observation further confirms the ability of our simplified model to elucidate generic dynamical features of real ultrathin films .",
    "having confirmed a switching event at @xmath34 , statistics were accumulated for 200 simulations at @xmath34 and also at fifteen weaker fields down to @xmath35 , as detailed in table  [ table ] . for each field ,",
    "100 simulations were performed at a constant , uniform temperature of @xmath36 , and 100 were performed using the time - dependent temperature profile given by eq .",

    "the error in the ratio @xmath51 is calculated in the standard way as @xmath52 the median switching time has the advantage over the mean that it can be estimated even when only half of the 100 simulations switch within the maximum number of time steps .",

    "if @xmath61 , many droplets will nucleate before the first one grows to a size comparable to the system , and many droplets will contribute to the switching process .",

    "[ fig : snap06a ] for @xmath35 .",
    "the crossover region between the sd and md regimes is known as the dynamic spinodal ( dsp).@xcite    one aspect of the md / sd picture that is particularly relevant to the current problem , is the fact that any switching event that takes place at a time @xmath63 can not be accomplished by a single droplet , and thus it must be due to the md mechanism.@xcite for a circular droplet in a square @xmath64 system , @xmath65 . using results from ref .",

    "[ fig : cum](c - f ) .",
    "a kink in the cumulative probability distribution for the heat - assisted runs is observed at @xmath69 , with significantly higher slopes in the md regime on the short - time side of @xmath69 , than in the sd regime on the long - time side . from these figures",
    "we see that the optimal field value for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , corresponds to the situation where just above 50% of the heat - assisted switching events are caused by the md mechanism , while essentially all the constant - temperature switching events are sd .",

    "in this paper we have studied a kinetic ising model of magnetization reversal under the influence of a momentary , spatially localized input of energy in the form of heat ( heat - assisted magnetization reversal , or hamr ) .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the hamr technique can significantly speed up the magnetization reversal in a uniform , applied magnetic field , and we find that this speed - up has its optimal value at intermediate values of the field . this effect is explained in terms of the md and sd mechanisms of nucleation - initiated magnetization switching in finite systems.@xcite the two - dimensional geometry chosen for this study is particularly appropriate for thin films .",
