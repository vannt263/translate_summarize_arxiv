    "recent technological development enables us to purchase various kinds of items and services via e - commerce systems .",
    "the emergence of internet applications has had an unprecedented impact on our life style to purchase goods and services . from available data of items and services at e - commerce platforms",
    ", we may expect that utilities of agents in socio - economic systems are directly estimated .",
    "such an impact on travel and tourism , specifically , on hotel room reservations , is significantly considered  @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "40 per cent of hotel reservations will be made via internet in 2008 , up from 33 per cent in 2007 and 29 per cent in 2006 .",
    "therefore , the coverage of room opportunities via the internet may be sufficient to provide statistically significant results , and to conduct a comprehensive analysis based on the hotel booking data collected from internet booking sites .    from our personal experience",
    ", it is found that it is becoming more popular to make reservations of hotels via the internet .",
    "when we use a hotel booking site , we notice that we sometimes find preferable room opportunities or not .",
    "namely , the hotel accessibility seems to be random .",
    "we further know that both the date and place of stay are important factors to determine the availability of room opportunities .",
    "hence , the room availability depends on the calendars ( weekdays , weekends , and holidays ) and regions .    this availability of the hotel rooms may indicate the future migration trends of travelers .",
    "therefore , it is worth considering accumulation of comprehensive data of hotel availability in order to detect inter - migration in countries .",
    "the migration processes have been intensively studied in the context of socio - economic dynamics with particular interest for quantitative research .",
    "weidlich and haag proposed the master equation with transition probabilities depending on both regional - dependent and time - dependent utility and mobility in order to describe collective tendency of agent decision in migration chance  @xcite .",
    "since the motivation of migration seems to come from both psychological and physical factors , the understanding of the dynamics of the migration is expected to provide useful insights on inner states of agents and their collective behavior .    in the present article",
    ", we discuss a model to capture behavior of consumers at a hotel booking site and investigate statistics of the number of available room opportunities from several perspectives .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] , we give a brief explanation of data description collected from a japanese hotel booking site . in sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] , we show an outlook of collected data of the room opportunities . in sec . [",
    "sec : model ] , we consider a model to capture room opportunities and derive a finite mixture of poisson distributions from binomial processes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimation ] , we introduce the em - algorithm to estimate parameters of the mixture of poisson distributions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - study ] , we computed parameter estimates for an artificial data set generated from the mixture of poisson distributions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : empirical - analysis ] , we show results of the empirical analysis on the room opportunities and discuss relationship between existing probabilities of opportunities and their rates . sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we give a brief explanation of a method to collect data on hotel availability . in this study",
    ", we used a web api ( application programing interface ) in order to collect the data from a japanese hotel booking site named jalan  .",
    "jalan is one of the most popular hotel reservation services which provide a webapi in japan .",
    "the api is an interface code set which is designed for a purpose to simplify development of application programs .",
    "jalan web service provides interfaces for both hotel managers and customers ( see fig . [",
    "fig : illustration ] ) .",
    "the mechanism of jalan is as follows : the hotel managers can enter information on room opportunities served by their hotels via an internet interface .",
    "the consumers can book rooms from available opportunities via the jalan web site .",
    "the third parties can even built their web services with the jalan data by using the web api .",
    "we are collecting all the available opportunities which appear in jalan regarding room opportunities in which two adults will be able to stay one night .",
    "the data are sampled from the jalan net web site ( _ http://www.jalan.net _ ) daily .",
    "the data on room opportunities collected through jalan web api are stored as csv files .    in the data set , there exist over 100,000 room opportunities from over 14,000 hotels . in tab . [",
    "tab : data ] , we show contents included in the data set .",
    "each plan contains sampled date , stay date , regional sequential number , hotel identification number , hotel name , postal address , url of the hotel web page , geographical position , plan name , and rate .",
    "since the data contain regional information , it is possible for us to analyze regional dependence of hotel rates . throughout the investigation , we regard the number of recorded opportunities ( plan ) as a proxy variable of the number of available room stocks .",
    ".the data format of room opportunities .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]      for four areas.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for four areas.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we analyzed the data of room opportunities collected from a japanese hotel booking site .",
    "we found that there is strong dependence of the number of available opportunities on the japanese calendar .",
    "firstly , we proposed a model of hotel booking activities based on a mixture of poisson distributions with time - dependent intensity . from a binomial model with a time - dependent success probability , we derived the mixture of poisson distributions .",
    "based on the mixture model , we characterized the number of room opportunities at each day with different parameters regarding their difference as motivation structure of consumers dependent on the japanese calendar .",
    "secondarily , we proposed a parameter estimation method on the basis of the em - algorithm and a method to select the underlying distribution for each observation from poisson distributions for the mixture through the maximization of the local log - likelihood value .",
    "thirdly , we computed parameters for artificial time series generated from the mixture of poisson distributions with the proposed method , and confirmed that the parameter estimates agree with the true values of parameters in statistically significant .",
    "we conducted an empirical analysis on the room opportunity data .",
    "we confirmed that the relationship between the averaged prices and the probabilities of opportunities existing is associated with demand - supply situations .",
    "furthermore , we extracted multiple time series of the numbers at four regions and found that the migration trends of travelers seem to depend on regions .",
    "it was found that these large - scaled data on hotel opportunities enable us to see several invisible properties of travelers behavior in japan .    as future work",
    ", we need to use more high - resolution data on booking of consumers at each hotel to capture demand - supply situations .",
    "if we can use such data , then we will be able to control room rates based on consumers preference .",
    "a future emerging technology will make it possible to see or foresee something which we can not see at this moment .",
    "this study was financially supported by the excellent young researcher overseas visiting program ( # 21 - 5341 ) of the japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) .",

    "thomas lux for his fruitful discussions and kind suggestions .",

    "in this section , we mention a derivation of the em algorithm from the maximum likelihood estimation procedure . let @xmath0 represent a mixture of @xmath1 poisson distributions @xmath2",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 denote mixing ratios , which are normalized as @xmath5 from observations @xmath6 the log - likelihood function in terms of the parameters @xmath7 can be written as @xmath8 inserting eqs .",

    "( [ eq : condition - ai2 ] ) we obtain @xmath15 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : condition - ri ] ) and ( [ eq : condition - rk ] ) we immediately obtain @xmath16    therefore , if we find an adequate set of initial values for parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , then we can calculate parameters by using the update rule for @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22    we compute these recursive equations by setting an arbitrary set of parameters .",
    "some of them are convergent and the others divergent .",
    "therefore , it is important for us to find an adequate set of initial values when we use the em - algorithm given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a - update - app ] ) and ( [ eq : q - update - app ] ) for estimation . to do so",
    ", we use a way to find a candidate of parameters in a stochastic manner .",
    "this procedure consists of three parts .",
    "the choice of initial values is based on finch et al.s algorithm  @xcite .",
    "their idea is that , given the mixing proportion @xmath10 , the @xmath23-th order statistics of observations @xmath24 are separated into @xmath1 parts .",

    "we randomly allocate @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and evaluate the log - likelihood function at the point .",
    "if the value of log - likelihood function at this point is finite , we choose this set of parameters as the new starting point for the recursive equation .    further setting the set of parameters as an initial condition",
    ", we recursively calculate the em - algorithm until the log - likelihood value converges .",
    "if it is greater than the maximum value of log - likelihood function which has already obtained in the monte carlo step , then the set of parameters as a candidate of parameter estimates .    repeating this procedure until we can not find any points which improve the value of log - likelihood function in the monte carlo step , we estimate an adequate set of parameters . this algorithm is described as follows .",
    "\\(5 ) if the maximum value of log - likelihood function in terms of the converged set of parameters is larger than @xmath38 , then set the value as @xmath38 and record the solution as a candidate of parameter estimates .",
