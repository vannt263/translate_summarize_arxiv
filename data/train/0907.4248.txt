    "the ( astrophysical ) interpretation of air shower data depends critically on our understanding of the properties of high - energy interactions .",

    "thus , improving our knowledge on high - energy interactions on one side , but at the same time also increasing our ( astrophysical ) understanding of the processes in the universe .",
    "this article summarizes experimental work presented at the meeting .",
    "the actual status , recent results , and their implications on the present understanding of the origin of very high - energy cosmic rays and their interactions are discussed .",

    "are usually considered to be of galactic origin @xcite .",

    "objective of air shower detectors is to derive information about the shower inducing primary particle from the registered secondary particles . addressing astrophysical questions with air - shower data",

    "however , recent measurements indicate that during solar bursts particles can be accelerated to significantly higher energies , exceeding 50  gev .",

    "are uncertainties in the cross sections for producing secondaries by charge - changing interactions in the atmosphere above the instrument .",
    "because there is a significant decrease in the interstellar path length with energy , the amount of boron , for example , at high energy is small  making the impact of uncertainties in the atmospheric boron contribution significant above @xmath45  gev / n . at these energies",
    "the contribution from charge - changing interactions in the atmosphere is similar in size to the total production of boron during propagation through the galaxy .",

    "detailed studies of the mass composition are under way .",
    "the 1  km@xmath54 icetop array @xcite at the south pole is half completed , see also .",
    "data taking has started with the existing parts .",
    "first analyses are under way , investigating the lateral distribution of air showers and shower size spectra .",
    "the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is presently explored with several instruments : the pierre auger observatory is taking data on its southern site @xcite , also the telescope array @xcite is fully operational , while the hires experiment @xcite has stopped data taking . a suppression of the flux has been observed at energies exceeding @xmath59  ev by the hires experiment @xcite and the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "one of the most exciting results of the last years is the discovery of the auger observatory that the arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays are non - isotropic and they are correlated with the position of the supergalactic plane on the sky @xcite .",
    "[ augerxmx ]    different methods are applied to reconstruct the mass composition from auger data , i.e.  the average depth of the shower maximum @xcite : is observed directly with the fluorescence telescopes and it is derived from data of the surface detectors investigating the rise time of the signals in the water detectors as well as evaluating the azimuthal asymmetry of the arrival time distributions .",
    "the values obtained are compiled in . a consistent trend towards a heavier mass with increasing energy can be recognized .",
    "it is an interesting challenge to combine the latest observations in an astrophysical scenario : the depression in the energy spectrum , the observed anisotropy of the arrival directions , and the development of the mass composition as function of energy .",
    "a correlation of the arrival directions with nearby ( @xmath60  mpc ) astronomical objects requires particles with a small charge to have only small deflections in the galactic ( and extra - galactic ) magnetic fields .",
    "a light composition would also be expected if the observed depression is the gzk effect @xcite . on the other hand , the data exhibit an increase of the average mass as function of energy .",
    "it is also possible that the depression in the spectrum is due to the maximum energy attained during the acceleration process . in this case",
    "one would expect a rigidity dependent cut - off behavior of individual elements ( similar to the one observed at the knee , but at much higher energies ) and one would obtain an increase of the mean mass as function of energy .    at present , the auger collaboration is preparing the northern site of the observatory with an area covering at least 10000  km@xmath54 @xcite",
    ". this will be an important and mandatory step towards astronomy with charged particles on the full sky .",
    "new experiments are under preparation to observe the fluorescence light of extensive air showers from above the atmosphere .",
    "the tus mission is planned for 2010 with the aim to measure about 10 events / year in the @xmath2  ev energy region @xcite .",
    "jem - euso is expected to be attached to the japanese module of the iss in 2013 to measure cosmic rays with energies exceeding @xmath50  ev @xcite .",
    "at the conference a wealth of new data has been presented .",
    "they improve our actual knowledge about the origin of high - energy cosmic rays . in the next years",
    "many new significant contributions are expected to reveal the origin of high - energy cosmic particles .",
    "the lhc will provide new data on high - energy interactions which will be extremely useful for the interpretation of air shower data .",
    "the atmospheric telescopes h.e.s.s . , magic , and veritas are taking data and are upgrading their detectors .",
    "tev gamma - ray astronomy has already made significant contributions to the understanding of the sources and the acceleration mechanisms for ( charged ) cosmic rays .",
    "the coming years are expected to lay open more secrets of galactic and extra - galactic sources .",
    "new balloon experiments are under preparation .",
    "they will improve our understanding of the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy .",
    "the grapes and tibet groups are currently upgrading their detectors and will provide new data on the composition of cosmic rays in the energy region of the knee in the spectrum ( @xmath57  ev ) .    several installations are devoted to the energy region of the transition from galactic to extra - galactic cosmic rays ( @xmath61  ev ) : kascade - grande , icecube / icetop , the low - energy extensions of the pierre auger observatory ( heat , amiga , aera ) , as well as the low - energy extension of the telescope array ( tale ) .",
    "a precise measurement of the mass composition in this energy region will be crucial to discriminate between different astrophysical scenarios .",
    "the origin of extra - galactic cosmic rays is investigated with set - ups operating at the highest energies : the telescope array is fully operational , the southern site of pierre auger observatory is fully operational , the northern site is under preparation , jem - euso is progressing fast .",
    "also the neutrino telescopes are expected to deliver significant data , antares is fully operational and km3net is on good track , icecube is expected to be completed in 2011 .    in summary",
    ", we are facing exciting times with big experimental challenges , they will offer unique opportunities and will provide new insights into the ( astro)physics of the universe in the next decade .",
    "it was a pleasure to summarize the experimental results of this meeting .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers for offering such an interesting scientific program .",
    "the author is grateful to valuable discussions with his colleagues from the pierre auger observatory , as well as from the kascade - grande , lopes , lofar , and tracer experiments ."
