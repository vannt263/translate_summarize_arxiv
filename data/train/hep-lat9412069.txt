    "the hadron mass spectrum is one of the fundamental quantities to calculate in lattice qcd .",
    "the columbia group has done hadron mass calculations with two flavors of staggered dynamical quarks for @xmath5 on a @xmath6 volume and @xmath7 on @xmath8 , both at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we also investigated @xmath9 on @xmath6 at @xmath10 @xcite .    in this note , we report a new study on a @xmath0 lattice with @xmath2 at @xmath1 . the increased time dimension from @xmath11 to @xmath12 gives longer plateaus in the effective mass plots so that hadron masses can be extracted more reliably .",
    "we systemically study the source size effects on the determination of the mass values .",
    "two non - local @xmath4 operators have also been added .",
    "they are measured in both coulomb gauge and landau gauge .",
    "table  [ tab : parameters ] lists the parameters of our calculation .",
    "we use the r-algorithm of gottlieb , _ et .",
    "@xcite for our evolution along with their notation .",
    "we have collected 3100 microcanonical time units during a 5 month run on the 256-node columbia parallel computer .",
    "hadron masses are measured every 6 time units . for a single gauge configuration",
    ", sources are set on 5 different time slices to perform an average over time slices ( aots ) .",

    "previously our 2z and z wall sources were non - zero across the entire spatial volume . in this run , however , we also set sources on smaller cubic spatial volumes . besides the dynamical quark mass",
    ", we also calculate quark propagators using different valence quark masses so that we can make hadron propagators out of different sets of quark masses .",
    "table  [ tab : parameters ] also lists all of our hadron source sizes and valence quark masses . out of all the possible combinations of source types , sizes and valence quark masses",
    ", we have a total of 19 combinations for mesons , 21 combinations the nucleon and 10 combinations for the @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolution ] shows the evolution of @xmath20 during our run .",
    "discarding the first 250 time units for thermalization gives @xmath21 .",
    "this is consistent with the value 0.0277(3 ) from our earlier @xmath6 run @xcite .",
    "we see quite significant source size effects on the effective mass plots for hadrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : effmass16 ] and  [ fig : effmass8 ] show from top to bottom the effective mass plots for @xmath22 on @xmath23 and @xmath24 sized sources . for the @xmath23 source ,",
    "the effective masses are quite flat as the distance varies .",
    "when the source size becomes smaller , the effective masses reach a plateau from above . the smaller the size of the source , the higher the value of the effective masses at short distances .",
    "this behavior is seen with all our different sources : @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , in our earlier @xmath26 calculation with a @xmath27 source , all the effective masses rose from below and the nucleon probably never reached a plateau . for our current data , all the effective masses from different sized sources converge to the same plateau .",
    "it is clear that @xmath23 is the optimal source size for this calculation because it gives the longest plateau .",
    "table  [ tab : masses ] is a list of hadron mass values for our current @xmath0 calculation .",
    "also listed for comparison are our earlier @xmath6 results .",
    "all our fits are correlated fits with errors determined from the jackknife method .",
    "the pion mass is obtained from a single state fit with the 2z source .",
    "all the other mesons and the nucleon come from two state fits with the 2z source .",
    "our @xmath4 s come from two state fits with the z source . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two equivalent lattice operators corresponding to the two @xmath30 operators in ref @xcite , respectively .",
    "all our sinks are local except for the @xmath4 s which are necessarily non - local in the staggered fermion formalism .",
    "figure  [ fig : effmassd0 ] is an effective mass plot for the coulomb gauge @xmath29 with a @xmath23 source .",
    "all our mass values are some what lighter than that found in the earlier @xmath6 run .",
    "the nucleon is especially light , about 3 standard deviations lower than the earlier result .",
    "this is not because of different fitting ranges ; fitting our data with distances up to 16 instead of 20 gives essentially the same mass spectrum .",
    "the two runs have about the same statistics .",
    "the earlier one has more averaging on a single configuration while the current one has more independent configurations . except for the possibility that we are seeing a finite temperature effect ( with antiperiodic boundary conditions in the time direction , our larger @xmath31 lowers the temperature from 53 mev to 44 mev . )",
    ", one may argue that in both of the runs , the errors are underestimated and that our simulation time is not sufficiently large to accurately compute the effects of autocorrelations .",
    "the @xmath4 masses measured in landau gauge are quite different from those measured with both the source and the sink time slices in coulomb gauge .",
    "they are about 3 standard deviations lower .",
    "in fact , their masses are in closer agreement with the nucleon than the coulomb gauge @xmath4 s .",
    "this raises a question about the validity of using landau gauge , non - local operators in general , since the gauge - dependent correlation between different time slices in landau gauge may alter the signal one wants to obtain .    setting the @xmath32 mass to 770 mev to fix the scale , we find @xmath33 = 436(6 ) mev , @xmath34 = 502(9 ) mev , @xmath35 = 1153(20 ) mev and @xmath36 mev ( averaging over our coulomb gauge @xmath29 and @xmath28 ) .",
