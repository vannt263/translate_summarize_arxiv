    "the dynamics of a second order , or weakly first order , phase transition is governed by long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter . these fluctuations ,",
    "whose length scale is much larger than the inverse temperature of the system , are essentially classical , since the probability of a quantum fluctuation over such scales is highly suppressed .",
    "for this reason , the details of the microscopic theory are not relevant to the description of the critical behaviour of the system , which can be successfully studied by using classical models , such as the ising model for ferromagnets or the ginsburg - landau theory for superconductors .    in these models",
    ", a free energy can be defined as a functional of a macroscopic order parameter , which is allowed to vary only on large length scales .",
    "the effect of the short wavelength ( quantum and thermal ) fluctuations is incorporated by the parameters appearing in the free energy ( masses , coupling constants , etc . ) , which are usually treated as phenomenological parameters but should in principle be computable , starting from the underlying theory .    the wilson renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite provides the natural framework in which this procedure can be systematically carried out .",
    "the main idea is to start from a microscopic theory , the parameters of which are supposed to be known , and then progressively integrate out the high frequency modes of the order parameter down to some infra - red cutoff @xmath2 . in this way one obtains a coarse - grained order parameter and the corresponding effective action , which can be used as the relevant tool to describe the system .    in this paper",
    ", we will apply this idea to quantum field theory at finite temperature .",
    "our approach will be the following .",
    "first , we will assume that we `` know '' the zero - temperature renormalized quantum field theory , which means that there exists some reliable approximation method ( perturbation theory , lattice simulations , etc . ) to compute the zero - temperature renormalized green functions .",
    "in this way , the renormalization constants can be fixed by the experimental measurements and all the parameters of the theory are known . in a rg language",
    ", we assume that all the quantum fluctuations have already been integrated out .",
    "second , we will integrate out thermal modes only , for frequencies higher than the infrared cutoff @xmath2 . for non - vanishing values for @xmath2",
    ", we will obtain coarse - grained order parameter and free energy , which are the appropriate objects to study the dynamics of long wavelength thermal fluctuations . in the limit @xmath3",
    ", we will obtain the finite temperature quantum field theory in thermal equilibrium .    in this approach ,",
    "since all the quantum fluctuations are integrated out from the beginning , it will be possible to relate the thermal field theory and the physical ( renormalized ) quantum field theory at zero temperature in a transparent way .    the ideal framework to perform this program of coarse - graining of thermal fluctuations is the real time ( rt ) formulation of thermal field theories @xcite , in which the thermal part in the free propagators is well separated from the zero - temperature quantistic one .",
    "as is well known , the price to pay for this is a doubling of the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "these `` ghost '' fields are necessary to cancel the so - called pinch singularities , which are due to the fact that the thermal fluctuations are on - shell . because of these technical complications matsubara s imaginary time ( it ) approach @xcite is more popular in the literature .",
    "in particular , the coarse - graining procedure can be precisely formulated in the so - called closed - time - path ( ctp ) formalism @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a clear presentation ) .",
    "indeed , the description of a system in which only the short wavelength fluctuations are in thermal equilibrium can be achieved by modifying the density matrix with respect to the thermal one , and the ctp was designed just to describe systems with a generic density matrix .",
    "anyway , the reader not familiar with the ctp formalism should not worry too much about it .",
    "as we will discuss in appendix a , the modification of the density matrix that we will consider is equivalent to working in the more familiar rt formulation of niemi and semenoff @xcite with a modified distribution function , given by the bose - einstein distribution function ( or the fermi - dirac , for fermions ) multiplied by the cutoff function .    as a first stage of this program , in this paper",
    "we illustrate our method by considering the well - studied self - interacting real scalar theory .",
    "as is well known , this model belongs to the universality class of the ising model , and then it has a second order phase transition .",
    "however , perturbation theory fails to reproduce this result even after the resummation of daisy and super - daisy diagrams @xcite , unless the gap equations are solved to @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the quartic coupling constant @xcite .",
    "we derive the `` exact '' wilson rg equation for the effective potential and approximate it by expanding in powers of space - time derivatives of the field .",
    "as we will discuss , even after our approximations , the effective potential computed in this approach includes more contributions than the super - daisy resummed one in @xcite and the prediction of a second order phase transition will emerge in a clear way . in particular , we will see that the running of the coupling constant , which is neglected in perturbation theory , has a very strong effect . at the critical temperature , the effective coupling constant vanishes together with the thermal mass , and this cures the severe infra - red problems encountered in perturbation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the cutoff thermal field theory and discuss its relationship with other rg approaches . in section 3",
    "we derive the rg flow equations for the quantities of interest . in section 4 the evolution equation for the cutoff effective potential",
    "is approximated in various ways in order to perform the numerical analysis .",
    "section 5 contains the results of our numerical study and section 6 some conclusions and further comments . in appendix",
    "a we briefly describe the closed time path method and how it applies to our case .",
    "appendix b contains a discussion of the problem of pinch singularities appearing in the kernel of rg flow equations .",
    "as explained in the introduction , our aim is to define a coarse - graining procedure in which all the quantum fluctuations , and the high frequency thermal ones down to an infra - red cutoff @xmath2 , are integrated out . in this section",
    "we will construct a path integral representation of the resulting generating functional of coarse - grained green functions , in the case of a self - interacting real scalar field .",
    "let us consider a free field , expanded in the usual manner in terms of annihilation and creation operators ( x ) = , [ free ] with @xmath6 ; @xmath7 represents here the zero - temperature , physical mass of the scalar particle .    in the case of an ideal gas in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath8",

    "are both temperature - dependent .",
    "in particular , in the second line , we have a `` thermal '' contribution , the @xmath10 inside the square brackets , and a @xmath0 , `` quantum '' contribution , the `` 1 '' .",

    "its expectation value is independent on the state and is the same as in the zero - temperature vacuum _ = ( 2 ) ^3 2 _ k ( k - k^ ) , [ commutation ] independent of @xmath12 .",
    "we propose to modify the above relations by introducing an infrared cutoff _ on the thermal part only _ , that is    ccl a_k^a_k^ _ ^ & = & ( 2 ) ^3 2 _ k n(_k ) ( |k| , ) ( k - k^ ) , + & + a_k a_k^^_^ & = & ( 2 ) ^3 2 _ k [ 1 + n(_k ) ( |k| , ) ] ( k - k^ ) ,    [ cutoff ] where , in general , @xmath13 is a cutoff function which is @xmath14 for @xmath15 and rapidly vanishes for @xmath16 .",
    "the simplest choice for @xmath17 is the heavyside theta function [ theta ] ( |k|, ) ( |k| -  ) . for simplicity , in the following we will always use the step function ,",
    "even though in order to perform safe formal manipulations one should choose @xcite a cutoff function which is always non - vanishing and of class @xmath18 , and take only at the end the limit .",
    "the physical state described by the relations in ( [ cutoff ] ) is the one in which thermal equilibrium is achieved only by the fast , high frequency , modes , from @xmath19 down to the cutoff scale @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding density matrix is given by = c , [ densitym ] where @xmath21 for @xmath22 and goes to infinity for @xmath23 . the quantum relation _",
    "^= ( 2 ) ^3 2 _ k ( k - k^ ) , analogous to eq .  , is valid , in this state , for any value of the momenta , irrespective of the cutoff .",
    "note that this would have not been the case if we had multiplied the whole right - hand side of the second eq .",
    "for the cutoff function @xmath17 .",
    "now the cutoff green functions are defined in the usual way , as statistical averages of heisenberg fields ordered along a path @xmath24 in the complex time plane @xcite , running from @xmath25 to @xmath26 along the real time axis and back from @xmath27 to @xmath28 infinitesimally below it .",
    "as we will show in appendix a , the effect of the non - thermal density matrix ( [ densitym ] ) can be accounted for by simply working in the usual equilibrium formalism , but with the bose - einstein distribution function multiplied by the cutoff function .",
    "for instance , the two - point green function is g^(c)(x , x^ ) = _ c(t - t^ ) c^>(x , x^ ) + _ c(t^-t ) c^<(x , x^ ) , [ green ] where @xmath29 is the generalization of the theta function on the contour @xmath24 and the two - point correlation functions are c^>(x , x^ ) = ( x ) ( x^ ) _ ^= c^<(x^,x ) .",

    ", we would like to comment on the relationship between our approach and the other formulations of the wilson rg existing in the literature .",
    "the first application of the continuum wilson rg philosophy to quantum field theory at @xmath0 is due to polchinski @xcite .",
    "the motivation of that work was to provide a demonstration of perturbative renormalizability without resorting to diagrammatic techniques .    in this formulation , which we will indicate in the following as the polchinski rg , only the modes between an infra - red cutoff @xmath48 and an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath49 are allowed to propagate inside loops .",
    "the bare euclidean lagrangian depends only on the uv scale @xmath49 , which is eventually sent to infinity , and the renormalization group flow describes the effect of quantum fluctuations coming into play as the infra - red cutoff @xmath48 is lowered .",
    "this can be achieved in a way formally analogous to what we have done in this section , the main difference being in the form of the cutoff propagator .",
    "namely , in this case the cutoff procedure has to be applied to the full propagator , and not only to a part of it , as we have done here .",
    "that is d__0(k ) = ( k ,  ) ( _0,k ) d(k ) , [ cutpol ] where @xmath50 is the tree level propagator .",
    "the internal legs of the green functions generated by the analogues of our @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , now carry only momenta @xmath54",
    ". therefore the 1pi green functions are given by the bare couplings for @xmath55 ( since no modes are propagating inside loops ) and by the fully renormalized ones for @xmath56 ( since in this limit the quantum corrections have been included at any momentum scale ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "since the cutoff procedure described in this section modifies the thermal part of the propagator only , the green functions defined in this paper contain the full quantum corrections , independently of the value of @xmath48 .",
    "lowering @xmath48 , we are introducing new _",
    "thermal _ modes only .",
    "in short , the polchinski formulation of the wilson rg interpolates between the _ bare _ and the _ physical _ ( renormalized ) theory , whereas the formulation presented in this paper interpolates between the _ physical _ theory at @xmath0 and the _ physical _ theory at @xmath1 .",
    "since the two rg s describe two different physical problems , also the boundary conditions will be different . as stated previously , at @xmath55 in the polchinski",
    "rg we have the bare lagrangian .",
    "thus , one should impose two different classes of boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the first one involves all the `` irrelevant '' operators , the ones with dimension larger than @xmath57 .",
    "these should satisfy the power counting in @xmath49 at the ultraviolet scale @xmath55 .",
    "the remaining , `` relevant '' , couplings have to be fixed by the matching of the renormalized theory and the physical observables , and so the initial conditions for them should be given at @xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand , in the approach presented in this paper , the physical theory corresponds to the initial condition at @xmath58 , so that all the couplings , both the relevant and the irrelevant ones , have to be fixed at this point .",
    "the wilson rg method has already been applied to the study of the @xmath1 quantum field theory in the it formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "the thermal propagator in the it formalism @xcite is obtained from the euclidean propagator after the replacement @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are the matsubara frequencies [ improp ] and the @xmath61 integration is consistently replaced by @xmath62 .",
    "while in the rt formalism the quantum and the thermal part of the propagator can be clearly identified , as in ( [ propagator ] ) , in the imaginary time formalism this separation can not be achieved , as we read from ( [ improp ] ) .",
    "so , in order to formulate a wilson rg in this case , we can only modify the thermal propagator as in ( [ cutpol ] ) , imposing an ir cutoff on the combination @xmath63 .",
    "in this case we recover the bare theory for @xmath64 , since no modes , either quantum or thermal , have been integrated in the loops , while for @xmath56 we have the physical theory at @xmath1 .",
    "this formulation of the rg describes the effect of thermal and quantum fluctuations at the same time , and it is different from both polchinski s and ours . concerning the boundary conditions in this case , it should be noticed that since the rg now interpolates between the bare theory and the @xmath1 physical theory , there is no value of @xmath48 that corresponds to the physical theory at @xmath0 , the one that is supposed to be directly related to the measurable observables .",

    "notice that one puts different sources for the two transition amplitudes , since one is mainly interested in following the forward time evolution . by introducing the density matrix @xmath157 of the initial state and setting @xmath166",

    "we see the origin of the name ctp .",

    "one can then introduce a standard path integral representation for the two matrix elements corresponding to the transitions from the state at @xmath162 to the state at @xmath170 and viceversa : z[j_+,j_-,]=_+,0 |    @xmath171 fields and sources correspond to the ones labelled with @xmath77 in the paper , respectively .",
    "therefore we introduce the vectors _",
    "a=(_+,_- ) , j_a=(j_+,j_- ) . as far as the initial state is concerned , one can always decompose the density matrix element at @xmath162 in the following way : [ densmatrix ] _ 1,0 ||_2,0= i\\ { k+k_a_a+k_ab_a_b+  } .",
    "therefore the information on the initial state is all contained in the non - local sources @xmath172 , which are obviously concentrated at @xmath162 .",
    "the various @xmath172 s are just boundary conditions in time for the corresponding green functions . in this way",
    "a perturbative expansion may be constructed , with the usual feynman rules .",
    "we now specify the form of the initial state .",

    "it may also be shown that indeed there is a certain freedom in the choice of the path to go from @xmath162 to @xmath175 , so that all the various formulations of the equilibrium thermal field theory are obtained .",

    "( [ densitym ] ) , is obtained by introducing a momentum - dependent temperature _ k , =\\ {    cc _ k & for ||> + & + + & for ||<    . .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , if the density matrix has this form all the initial @xmath176-point correlations , k in , vanish for @xmath177 , and the result for the density matrix element is obtained from eq .",
    "after the substitution @xmath178 .    as a consequence , the only modification with respect to the usual equilibrium rt formalism will consist in replacing the bose - einstein distribution function in the free propagators , with the cut off one defined in .",

    "then the @xmath48-derivative of the matrix self - energy cooperates with the kernel @xmath179 to give the @xmath48-derivative of the full propagator , which is free of pinch singularities .",
