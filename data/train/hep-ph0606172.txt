    "the minimal standard model for strong weak and electromagnetic interactions has been extremely successful .",
    "however , the recent measurement of neutrino masses requires some modifications to the minimal theory , the simplest being the addition of nonrenormalizable dimension five operators which generate neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino masses , and the fact that in the minimal standard model the couplings almost unify  @xcite , suggests that unification of the strong weak and electromagnetic interactions occurs at some high scale , and neutrino mass terms are generated by the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "most of the extensions of the standard model with new physics at the tev scale have been motivated by the hierarchy puzzle , i.e. , why is the weak scale so small compared with the planck or unification scales .",
    "however , the measured value of the cosmological constant suggests that a fine tuning that is qualitatively similar to that needed to achieve the smallness of the weak scale is needed for the cosmological constant .",
    "perhaps we are not looking at this issue correctly .",
    "if one does not adopt the hierarchy puzzle as the criteria for motivating extensions of the standard model then one can take a more general point of view .",
    "certainly the hypothesis that the scalar sector contains a single scalar doublet has not been tested experimentally .",
    "adding additional scalars that can couple to the quarks typically results in unacceptably large flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "glashow and weinberg  @xcite studied extensions with many scalar doublets , and found that if one scalar coupled to the up type quarks and one scalar to the down type quarks , then large tree level flavor changing neutral currents are avoided .",
    "they noted that this can be enforced by discrete symmetries .    in this paper ,",
    "we study the most general scalar structure of the standard model , which naturally maintains the smallness of flavor changing neutral currents . in the minimal standard model ,",

    "the phenomenology of the minimal standard model with an additional @xmath0 scalar is studied in the remainder of this paper .",
    "this model contains additional sources of @xmath7 nonconservation beyond the standard model ckm phase .",
    "the new sources of @xmath7 nonconservation give rise to a contribution to the electric dipole moment of the neutron that can be near its present experimental limit .",

    ", we showed that the production rate for the higgs particle at the lhc is very sensitive to new physics . in this paper",
    "we show that for a range of parameters , the color octet scalars we have added can have a significant impact on the rate for higgs production through gluon fusion .",
    "even though there are no flavor changing neutral currents from tree level color octet scalar exchange , the charged octet scalars induce flavor changing effects through loop graphs .",
    "these small deviations in the standard model predictions may be of interest in future high precision tests of the flavor structure of the standard model .",
    "there are two perspectives one can have on the model we are studying .",
    "one is to treat the scalars as fundamental up to some very high scale . in this case",
    ", it is desirable to have unification of the gauge couplings .",
    "we show that if one adds three real scalars with @xmath1 quantum numbers @xmath8 then acceptable unification is achieved with a unification scale that is large enough to suppress proton decay . on the other hand it is possible that the scalars observed are only the low energy remnants of some more complicated dynamics for the scalar sector that becomes manifest at an energy scale much below the gut or planck scales .",

    "then for @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "the additional @xmath2 triplets add the following terms to the most general renormalizable scalar potential , @xmath227 where @xmath228 labels the different triplets .",
    "we have suppressed the @xmath2 indices on the higgs doublet and on the color octet scalars .",
    "brackets are sometimes used to indicate how the suppressed @xmath2 indices are contracted .",
    "we assume that there is an approximate @xmath229 symmetry that is broken by the very small dimensionful parameters @xmath230 and @xmath231 as well as the dimensionful parameter @xmath232 . for simplicity",
    ", we take the triplet scalars to be very heavy so that their production at the lhc is negligible .",
    "since the parameters that break the @xmath229 symmetry are very small , the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of these fields can be neglected .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath233 symmetry breaking is needed for these scalars to decay .",
    "the above scenario gives acceptable coupling constant unification and proton decay , with only a modest extension of the low - energy scalar sector of the standard model .",
    "the scalar sector of the standard model may be more complicated than just a single higgs doublet .",
    "we argued that natural suppression of flavor changing neutral currents implies that only scalars with @xmath1 quantum numbers of the higgs doublet or @xmath0 will couple to the quarks .",
    "motivated by this we considered the phenomenology of a model where a @xmath0 scalar is added to the minimal standard model . even though this model has no flavor changing neutral currents at tree level ,",
    "it does give corrections from loop graphs , that may be important for precision flavor physics .",
    "in particular there are new sources of @xmath7 violation which give rise to a contribution to the electric dipole monent of the neutron that can be near the present experimental limit .    for a range of parameters ,",
    "the modification of the standard model we propose can have a significant impact ( factors of two ) on the higgs boson production rate at the lhc .",
    "the spectrum of the color octet scalars depend on parameters in the higgs potential , and it influences the decay channels available to these scalars . for a range of parameters , the effects of these colored scalars would first be seen indirectly at the lhc via their influence on the higgs production rate , rather than via direct colored scalar production .",
    "finally we showed that unification of the gauge couplings occurs in our model if one also adds three real scalars with @xmath1 quantum numbers @xmath234 .",
    "we thank m. ramsey - musolf for useful discussions on the electric dipole moment of the neutron .",
    "we also thank c.  anastasiou , m. graesser , d. hitlin , g. isidori , and z. ligeti for comments .",

    "mfv leads to neutral current flavor conservation .",
    "the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "neutral current flavor conservation implies that all the yukawa matrices are diagonal in the same basis .",
    "mfv requires that they are all proportional ( to @xmath235 or @xmath236 ) , which is a stronger constraint .",
    "we have argued that the additional requirement of _ naturalness _ implies the stronger constraint that all the yukawa couplings are proportional to @xmath235 or @xmath236 , and hence implies mfv .",
    "what is natural depends on assumptions about the underlying theory and how parameters are generated .",
    "we have assumed that symmetries are important , and that the underlying theory has a @xmath3 flavor symmetry that is broken , and this breaking generates yukawa matrices .",
    "there are other scenarios which would lead to different conclusions . for definiteness ,",
    "consider two yukawa matrices @xmath237 and @xmath160 which transform like @xmath238 . they can be written as @xmath239 where @xmath240 and @xmath241 are unitary , and @xmath242 are real , non - negative and diagonal .",
    "it is possible that the underlying theory generates @xmath242 by some mechanism , and @xmath243 by a different mechanism which naturally gives @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "then one would automatically have no tree - level flavor changing currents , but the mfv constraint would not be satisfied since @xmath246 and @xmath247 need not be proportional .",
    "note that a simple algebraic relation such as @xmath248=0 $ ] is not equivalent to the requirement that @xmath237 and @xmath160 are simultaneously diagonalizable , since @xmath237 and @xmath160 are not hermitian .",
    "simple counterexamples for two flavors are @xmath249 which commute but are not simultaneously diagonalizable , and @xmath250 which are simultaneously diagonalizable but do not commute ."
