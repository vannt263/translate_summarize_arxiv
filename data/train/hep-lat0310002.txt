    "a study of heavy - light mesons is not just for academic interest , since they are also realised in nature .",
    "the best examples are the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons , which have quark structures @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "since the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks have masses of about @xmath14 and @xmath15  gev , respectively , we see that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 are indeed heavy - light mesons and can be thought of as the `` hydrogen atom '' for quark systems .",
    "recently the discovery of a narrow resonance in the @xmath18 channel by the babar collaboration has provoked a lot of interest in accurate measurements of the energies of higher angular momentum states of mesons on a lattice .",
    "unfortunately there is no experimental data available on the p - wave state energies of @xmath16 or @xmath17 mesons at present .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath19 mesons from lattice is discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "in this study the heavy quark is taken to be infinitely heavy , whereas the light quark mass is approximately that of the strange quark .",
    "the lattice parameters are given in table [ param_table ] .",
    ".lattice configurations used with wilson glue and tadpole - improved clover fermions .",
    "dynamical configurations ( two quark flavours ) have light valence quarks which are the same as the sea - quarks @xcite .",
    "the number of configurations is 20 in the quenched cases ( @xmath20 ) and 78 in the unquenched case ( @xmath21 ) . for @xmath20 @xmath22 and in the @xmath21 case @xmath23 .",
    "here we take @xmath24  fm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the basic quantity for evaluating the energies of heavy - light mesons is the 2-point correlation function ",
    "see fig .",

    ".,scaledwidth=17.0% ]    it is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the heavy ( infinite mass)-quark propagator and @xmath27 the light anti - quark propagator .",
    "@xmath28 is a linear combination of products of gauge links at time @xmath29 along paths @xmath30 and @xmath31 defines the spin structure of the operator . the @xmath32 means the average over the whole lattice .",
    "the energies are extracted by fitting the two - point correlator @xmath33 with a sum of exponentials , @xmath34 the use of several fuzzing levels allows us to extract not only the lowest mass but also the first excited state for different angular momentum states . the resulting energy spectrum is shown in fig . [ espect ] . when comparing lattices of different sizes ( @xmath35 vs. @xmath36 ) and different lattice spacings ( @xmath37  fm vs. @xmath38  fm ) a very good agreement is found .",
    "effects coming from quenching ( compared with dynamical fermions ) as well as finite size effects and finite lattice spacing corrections seem to be small .",
    "in the literature @xcite , there have been claims that the spectra of heavy - light mesons should exhibit inverted multiplets , where the l@xmath3 state lies lower in energy than the l@xmath2 state . for small values of l  in an interquark potential description  the one gluon exchange potential is expected to dominate leading to the `` natural '' ordering where the l@xmath2 state lies lower than the l@xmath3 . however , as l ( or the principal quantum number n ) increases , a model containing a confining potential should eventually invert this natural order . in @xcite",
    "this claim is compared with the experimentally observed 1p - states of the @xmath39 meson and the natural ordering prevails .      in non - relativistic models of conventional mesons",
    "the splitting between the l@xmath3 and l@xmath2 states is caused by introducing spin - orbit interactions explicitly .",
    "in contrast , a dirac equation description with a spin - independent potential can automatically lead to spin - orbit splitting .",
    "however , in the extreme case where the scalar ( @xmath40 ) and vector ( @xmath41 ) potentials differ only by a constant @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 , this splitting is naturally small @xcite",
    ". this could be approximately true asymptotically , i.e. when the distance between the heavy quark and the light quark is large .",
    "in such a limit a qualitative fit to our data can be obtained @xcite .",
    "however , gromes seems to rule out vector exchange for the confining quark - antiquark potential @xcite .",
    "the data favour small @xmath44 splitting , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the results from three different lattices show that changing quenched configurations to dynamical fermions does not lead to a large change in energies . also",
    "no signs of finite size effects or large errors due to finite @xmath0 are observed .",
    "spin - orbit splitting is found to be small for both @xmath30- and @xmath39-wave states .",
    "* understand the energies and @xmath45-wave densities @xcite phenomenologically using the dirac equation . * measure correlations in the baryonic and @xmath46 systems @xcite .",
    "* measure the @xmath30- , @xmath39- and @xmath47-wave densities .",
    "the authors wish to thank the center for scientific computing in espoo , finland for making available resources without which this project could not have been carried out .",
    "one of the authors ( j.k . )",
    "wishes to thank the finnish cultural foundation and the academy of finland ( project 177881 ) for financial support ."

    "<S> the energies of different angular momentum states of a heavy - light meson were measured on a lattice in @xcite . we have now repeated this study using a larger , quenched lattice to check that there the finite size effects are under control . </S>",
    "<S> also the effect of quenching is studied by using dynamical fermion configurations . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the lattice spacing @xmath0 is smaller , which allows one to make an estimate of @xmath1 corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the new measurements confirm the earlier calculated energy spectrum .    from some theoretical considerations </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that , for high angular momentum states , the multiplets should be inverted compared with the coulomb spectrum , i.e. l@xmath2 should lie higher than l@xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when a pure scalar confining potential is present . here </S>",
    "<S> the notation l@xmath3(@xmath2 ) means that the light quark spin couples to angular momentum l giving the total @xmath4l@xmath5 . experimentally this inversion is not seen for p - wave mesons , and lattice measurements </S>",
    "<S> now suggest that there is no inversion in the d - wave either . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we find that the spin - orbit splitting is very small for both values l@xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
