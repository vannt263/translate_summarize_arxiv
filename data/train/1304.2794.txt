    "algebraic quantum field theory @xcite has proved to be a powerful framework for understanding superselection structure in local quantum physics , the possible patterns of coherent subspaces ( sectors ) of the physical state space . for theories in minkowskian spacetime , describing exclusively states of compactly localizable charges  @xcite or massive particles  @xcite , this structure encoded in the local observables is fully understood : the sectors in any such theory correspond to the dual of some compact group , interpreted as a global gauge group ; each sector carries a specific representation of the permutation group , determining its statistics ; and there are charged field operators transforming as tensors under the global gauge group , satisfying bose or fermi commutation relations at spacelike distances and interpolating between the various sectors  @xcite .",
    "these results have been extended successfully to theories in lower dimensions , where quantum groups can appear in the description of the superselection structure and sectors can have braid group statistics  @xcite .",
    "yet the physically important class of theories describing long range forces mediated by massless particles , such as quantum electrodynamics , is not covered by these results .",
    "in fact , attempts to clarify their superselection structure @xcite have failed , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the difficulties in these theories can be traced back to two related features , namely the long range effects of the forces between charged particles and the multifarious ways in which their interaction can form clouds of low energy massless particles . in quantum electrodynamics , for example , any configuration of electrically charged particles gives rise to a specific long range structure of the electromagnetic field , created , both by the coulomb fields of the moving charges and by the infrared clouds caused by their acceleration .",
    "the resulting long range tails of the electromagnetic field can be discriminated by central sequences of local observables , hence giving rise to an abundance of different superselection sectors  @xcite .    whereas the electric charge carried by particles is a superselected quantity of fundamental physical significance , the long range features of the infrared clouds are a theoretical concept defying experimental verification . when applying the theory ,",
    "this is usually taken into account by considering inclusive processes where expectation values are summed over the undetected low energy photons .",
    "this procedure effectively amounts to wiping out marginal features of the infrared sectors without destroying physically relevant information , such as their total charge .",
    "in other words , the notion of superselection sector provides too fine a resolution of the physical state space leading to unnecessary theoretical complications .",
    "it seems desirable to use concepts closer to actual experimental practice and providing a coarser resolution of the physical state space .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to establish such a framework and discuss its theoretical implications .",
    "our approach is based on the fundamental fact that both measurements and the preparation of specific states can extend well into the future , whereas it is impossible to perform these operations in the distant past .",
    "thus the spacetime regions where actual experiments can take place are at best future directed light cones @xmath0 in minkowski space whose apices are fixed by some largely arbitrary initial event . of course",
    ", these limitations on the spacetime localization of concrete physical operations do not imply that it is impossible to obtain information about past properties of global states .",
    "but this information can only be obtained indirectly by making measurements in these states in some accessible light cone @xmath0 and trying to reconstruct their past values from the data on the basis of theory . in this context , it has to be noted that there is a fundamental difference between theories describing only massive particles and theories including massless particles as well . in the massive case ,",
    "the unital c*algebras @xmath1 generated by the local observables in any given light cone @xmath0 are generically irreducible @xcite . in principle , therefore , all the information on the global properties of a state can be derived from measurements made in any such region @xmath0 . in the presence of massless particles , however , the algebra @xmath2 of observables localized in @xmath0 is highly reducible and time translations act on it as proper endomorphisms  @xcite .",
    "thus , as time proceeds , one loses information about past properties of the states .",
    "this constant loss is inevitable since , by huygens principle , outgoing massless particles created in the past of a given light cone @xmath0 will never enter that cone .",
    "hence their properties can not be determined by later measurements in @xmath0 .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that , by the same mechanism , the various sectors formed by infrared clouds can not be distinguished by measurements in any fixed light cone  @xmath0 ; discriminating them requires observations in larger regions of minkowski space . on the other hand , the total charge carried by massive particles , such as the electric charge ,",
    "can be determined in any given  @xmath0 . for these particles will either eventually enter this cone , or some of them will ,",
    "in the course of time , be annihilated or created in pairs of conjugate charge .",
    "but the total charge is not affected and can be sharply determined by measurements in the given @xmath0 .",
    "these features are relevant in the present context .",
    "they imply that states of equal total charge differing only by infrared clouds created in collisions are mutually normal if restricted to the algebra of observables @xmath2 of any given light cone @xmath0 . in this way ,",
    "an abundance of superselection sectors coalesce to form a _",
    "charge class _  @xcite . thus restricting measurements to light cones has a similar effect to summing expectation values over undetected massless particles .",
    "these observations suggest basing the analysis and physical interpretation of minkowski space theories entirely on the algebras @xmath2 of observables localized in a given light cone  @xmath0 .",
    "this should avoid infrared problems right from the outset . yet implementing this idea requires solving several conceptual problems .",
    "\\(a )  as already mentioned , in the presence of massless particles the algebras @xmath2 are reducible in any sector .",
    "in fact , their weak closures are generically factors of type  iii@xmath3 , as can be inferred from results established in @xcite .",
    "there is then no intrinsic way of superimposing states of @xmath2 and the usual characterization of sectors fails .",
    "here we need the notion of charge class , expressed in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "the states on @xmath2 , belonging to a given charge class , are distinguished by being primary ( or even pure in the absence of massless particles ) and can be transformed into each other by the operational effects of observables localized in the light cone @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , two relevant primary states @xmath4 , @xmath5 on the algebra @xmath2 belong to the same charge class if @xmath4 can be mapped into any given ( norm ) neighbourhood of  @xmath5 by the adjoint action of some inner automorphism of @xmath2 , and _",
    "vice versa_. this criterion generalizes the notion of superselection sector in the irreducible case and remains meaningful in the presence of massless particles , for the inner automorphisms of type  iii@xmath3 factors act almost transitively on normal states  @xcite and can be approximated by inner automorphisms of @xmath2 by the kaplansky density theorem .",
    "\\(b )  in quantum field theory , local operations on states can create charges in conjugate pairs .",
    "this allows one to pass from states in the vacuum sector in minkowski space to states in a charged sector by using a suitable charge transfer chain to create a charge in some region by shifting the conjugate charge along some path to spacelike infinity ( `` behind the moon '' ) where it evades observation .",
    "the energetic effects of this operation can be controlled by not putting a sharp restriction on the location of the chosen path , allowing it to fluctuate within some spacelike cone .",
    "the resulting limit states are in a charged sector , but , by locality , coincide with the initial states for observations in the spacelike complement of the chosen cone  @xcite .",
    "one can proceed similarly in the light cone @xmath0 . to see this , regard @xmath0 as a globally hyperbolic spacetime with a metric induced from the ambient minkowski space .",
    "it is foliated by hyperboloids ( time  shells ) parametrized by the proper time of inertial observers passing through the apex of  @xmath0 . in the spacetime @xmath0 ,",
    "minkowskian spacelike infinity is replaced by the asymptotic lightlike boundary of  @xmath0 .",
    "the analogues of spacelike cones in minkowski space are hypercones @xmath6 , the causal completions of hyperbolic cones formed by geodesics on a given time ",
    "shell emanating from a common apex .",
    "( the precise definition of these hypercones is given in the appendix . ) as in minkowski space , a limiting procedure using local unitary operators from the algebra @xmath7 of some hypercone @xmath8 creates charges in pairs , allowing one to pass from states in the charge class of the vacuum to states in another charge class .",
    "the resulting limit operation yields states in the new charge class , agreeing with the initial states for observations in the spacelike complement @xmath9 of the chosen hypercone by locality .",
    "now , whereas the electrically charged sectors in minkowski space depend on the direction of the spacelike cone used to prepare them , this is not so for charge classes created by the analogous operations in the spacetime  @xmath0 : the disjoint infrared clouds produced using different cones can not be sharply discriminated in @xmath0 .",
    "hence the charge class of the resulting states does not depend on the choice of hypercone @xmath8 .",
    "so these infrared problems disappear for observers in  @xmath0 .",
    "as will be argued later , these heuristic considerations are reflected in the following mathematical setting . denoting by @xmath10 the weak closure of the algebra @xmath2 relative to the vacuum class",
    ", our charge classes can be reached from the vacuum class using a morphism @xmath11 localized in some hypercone @xmath8 , that is @xmath12 acts trivially on @xmath13 , whereby @xmath14 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "our analysis shows that these morphisms have a rich algebraic structure , familiar from the theory of superselection sectors .",
    "\\(c )   spacetime translations in @xmath0 do not induce automorphisms of @xmath2 , posing the question of how to define the energy content of states on these algebras . in a massive theory",
    "this is not a problem , since the light cone algebras are irreducible in all sectors and the spectral resolutions of the global energy ",
    "momentum operators are contained in their weak closures .",
    "it then makes physical sense to characterize states of @xmath2 by their spectral properties .",
    "these can in principle be checked with arbitrary precision in any light cone @xmath0 .",
    "but in the presence of massless particles the total energy of a state can no longer be sharply determined by such measurements since the energy carried by outgoing massless particles created in the past of @xmath0 fluctuates in the corresponding statistical ensemble and can not be deduced from measurements in  @xmath0 . when analyzing the energy content of states one can , however , exploit the fact that the semigroup of future - directed time translations acts as endomorphisms on each algebra @xmath2 .",
    "this allows one to introduce a notion of covariance for charge classes and to establish the existence of selfadjoint generators for the semigroup action .",
    "even though these generators can not be interpreted as energy observables since they include gross fluctuations of the energy in @xmath0 , like the liouvillians in quantum statistical mechanics , they contain relevant information on the energy content of states .",
    "in fact , as massless particles in the past of @xmath0 are not taken into account , one expects on physical grounds that they provide ( fuzzy ) lower bounds on the total energy of states and are bounded from below , like the global energy .",
    "the relevant notions above are all that is required for analyzing charge classes .",
    "no global information is needed , only the algebras of local observables for fixed @xmath0 and the endomorphic action of the semigroup @xmath15 on @xmath2 , where @xmath16 denotes the closed semigroup of future directed translations and @xmath17 the group of proper orthochronous lorentz transformations on @xmath0 .",
    "this input suffices to the vacuum state on @xmath2 and to determine its properties . in particular , one can the existence of a continuous unitary representation of the full poincar group @xmath18 in its gns ",
    "representation satisfying the relativistic spectrum condition whose restriction to the semigroup @xmath19 induces the given endomorphic action on  @xmath2 .",
    "states in the charge class of the vacuum are induced by vectors in this gns  representation .",
    "the analysis of all other charge classes can be based on the above hypercone localized morphisms @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to simple charge classes and simple morphisms , to be defined later .",
    "this important special case ( which includes the electric charge ) simplifies the exposition whilst retaining the novel features .",
    "equivalent simple morphisms carry the same ( simple ) charge . using simple morphisms and an appropriate version of haag duality @xcite in the spacetime @xmath0 ,",
    "one concludes that there is a composition law for the simple charges making the set of simple charges into an abelian group where the inverse is charge conjugation .",
    "a simple charge and its conjugate either obey bose or fermi statistics . more precisely , exchanging such a pair of charges is described by charge transport operators which are @xmath21 or @xmath22 respectively , whenever the charges are localized in spacelike separated hypercones . finally , the group of simple charges is the dual of some compact abelian group , the global gauge group , when all charges are simple .",
    "thus the general structure of these families resembles that of the simple sectors of localizable charges in minkowski space  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , there is a meaningful notion of covariant charges .",
    "one requires corresponding morphisms @xmath12 to be extendible to coherent families of morphisms @xmath23 , @xmath24 , as explained below .",
    "it turns out that the set of simple covariant charges is a subgroup of the set of simple charges .",
    "moreover , each covariant simple morphism has an associated continuous unitary representation of the covering group of the poincar group @xmath18 , unique up to equivalence , inducing the endomorphic action of @xmath19 on @xmath2 . in accordance with physical expectations ,",
    "these representations are shown to satisfy the relativistic spectrum condition .",
    "these results do not depend on the choice of light cone @xmath25 .",
    "in the present approach , analyzing the state space of local theories provides a consistent physical picture even in the presence of massless particles .",
    "the interpretation of a theory in terms of light cone data reflects experimental limitations and provides a `` geometric regularization '' thus avoiding the spurious infrared problems appearing in treatments based on minkowski space .",
    "this observation may also lead to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of quantum decoherence .",

    "the preceding results accurately describe the energetic properties of the states of interest here .",
    "they also throw new light on the appearance of superselection rules in quantum field theory . from the present theoretical point of view , based on observations and operations performed in a light cone  @xmath25 , the creation of a charged state in  @xmath25 is achieved by creating a pair and pushing the opposite charge to lightlike infinity . in practice , however , this would require an unlimited amount of energy since the opposite charge would have to be accelerated to the speed of light .",
    "the experimental creation of a charged state can therefore only be accomplished locally by moving the opposite charge sufficiently far away ( `` behind the moon '' ) . in other words ,",
    "superselection rules appear when the total charge in  @xmath25 can not be changed by realistic physical operations due to an infinite energy barrier . nevertheless , the theoretical limit states on @xmath25 are meaningful idealizations allowing us to analyze the properties of charges . as we have seen , relative to the vacuum , these states have finite energy bounded from below . the infinite energy needed for their creation from the vacuum",
    "is carried away by the opposite charge and not visible anymore in @xmath25 in the limit .",
    "throughout the preceding discussion , we have restricted attention to the algebra of observables in a given light cone @xmath25 . whether this algebra is part of a larger algebra in minkowski space or not did not matter . yet",
    "interestingly enough the framework established here can be used to construct an extension of the theory to a theory on minkowski space @xmath763 . whereas this canonical extension may seem somewhat arbitrary from an observational point of view , it enables us to establish in a physically meaningful manner that our results do not depend on the choice of light cone @xmath25 .",
    "the basic ingredient is the relation between our semigroup @xmath19 and the group  @xmath18 it generates .",
    "@xmath19 is a semidirect product of its subsemigroup of future directed ( time ) translations and the lorentz group .",
    "the time translations are a normal subsemigroup generating the group of spacetime translations and @xmath18 is the semidirect product of the group of spacetime translations and the lorentz group .",
    "this tight relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath18 allows us to induce up structures relating to @xmath19 to a corresponding structure relating to @xmath18 .",
    "topological aspects of this principle can be incorporated efficiently by observing that @xmath19 contains an interior point of @xmath18 . from @xmath451 in proposition  [ bargmann ]",

    "the induced structure for @xmath18 is minkowski space @xmath26 , the quotient of @xmath18 by the lorentz group .",
    "we leave it to the reader to formalize the construction of the affine space @xmath26 together with its lorentzian metric as an extension of @xmath25 equipped with the analogous structure .",
    "thus an observer in @xmath25 , aware of the way @xmath19 acts , can talk about minkowski space .",

    ", the net @xmath40 of observable algebras in the given light cone @xmath25 extends to a net on minkowski space .",
    "we recall that the extended net is fixed by assigning to each double cone the algebra  @xmath764 , where @xmath115 is such that @xmath765 .",
    "this assignment defines an ( isotonous ) net @xmath112 on  @xmath26 which is local and covariant with regard to the adjoint action of @xmath86 , @xmath766 .",

    "these extensions of the net @xmath40 and state @xmath59 are uniquely fixed by the hypothesis of a global ( minkowskian ) vacuum state entering into the chosen extension of @xmath72 to  @xmath18 . yet , as already mentioned , in the presence of massless particles , other extensions consistently describe different prehistories of @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless this canonical extension is useful since observations made in different light cones @xmath769 may be compared , provided the respective observers use their ( partial ) vacua as reference states and reconstruct the representation @xmath72 of @xmath18 from their respective observations .",
    "every pair of light cones contains some common light cone @xmath770 , so both observers have access to @xmath25 and would , in principle , be able to reconstruct the same global net @xmath112 and vacuum state  @xmath116 from their partial information . if they conventionally regard their partial vacua as restrictions of the global vacuum state , @xmath771 , @xmath510 , it would make sense for the observers to compare their past data in their common future .    the properties of simple covariant charges as seen by observers in different light cones can likewise be compared on this same basis since the corresponding can be extended to the minkowskian net .",
    "let be any covariant morphism and let @xmath463 be the associated representation of @xmath498 .",
    "the extension of @xmath12 to the operators @xmath119 is given by @xmath772 where @xmath115 is so large that @xmath773 .",
    "this assignment yields a well defined morphism @xmath774 transforming covariantly under the adjoint action of @xmath463 , as is easily verified .",
    "note that this extension is completely fixed by data available in @xmath25 .",
    "now given @xmath775 put @xmath776 . if @xmath12 is a simple hypercone localized morphism in @xmath25 , then @xmath777 is a simple hypercone localized morphism in @xmath778 , its composition with the vacuum @xmath116 leads to a charge class with all properties specified in the defining criterion .",
    "we refrain from giving a detailed proof here but just indicate the main points .",
    "let @xmath779 with @xmath780 . if the morphism @xmath12 is localized in the hypercone @xmath14 , lemma  [ cocycleloc ] and the cocycle equation imply @xmath781 , where @xmath782 and is some hypercone in @xmath25 . as shown in  [ a.13 ]",
    ", there is a hypercone .",
    "hence , denoting the weak closures of algebras in the minkowskian net by the symbol  @xmath783 , one has @xmath784 and @xmath785 is a hypercone in @xmath778 , based on the shifted hyperboloid @xmath786 .",
    "but @xmath787 so @xmath788 is localized in @xmath789 . moreover , if @xmath790 are equivalent morphisms on @xmath2 with intertwiners @xmath791 , then @xmath792 are equivalent on @xmath793 with intertwiners @xmath794 given by @xmath795 letting the morphisms and their localization vary using lorentz covariance one finds that the families of equivalent hypercone localized morphisms in @xmath25 are restrictions of families of equivalent hypercone localized morphisms in @xmath778 .",
    "thus the analysis of the preceding sections and the corresponding results apply to the latter families , too .    even though the morphisms and their intertwiners depend , in general , on the choice of light cone , important physical data , such as their statistics parameters @xmath796 do not since the intertwiners @xmath797 depend continuously on @xmath798 as can be seen from the expression given above .",
    "hence the statistics parameters stay constant under changes of the light cone .",
    "moreover , the spectral properties of the charge classes do not depend on the choice of light cone , either .",
    "since for any pair of light cones @xmath769 there is a light cone @xmath799 , the respective observers will agree on the intrinsic properties of the charges .",
    "despite the fact that the interpretation of charged states does not depend on the choice of light cone , it would not make sense , in general , to take a global view .",
    "for example , the equivalence of morphisms for any light cone @xmath778 does _ not _ imply that , the two representations may differ by infrared clouds of massless particles superselected in  @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , from the minkowskian point of view , the morphisms  @xmath800 in general do not have localization properties allowing composition and an analysis of statistics .",
    "thus , for the interpretation of theories with long range forces , the restriction to light cones is not only physical meaningful but also solves these infrared problems .",
    "another aspect of the preceding analysis is worth mentioning .",
    "the species of localizable charges , exhaustively treated from the minkowskian point of view in @xcite , also fit into the present light cone setting .",
    "it is a distinctive feature of this type of charge that the intertwiners between morphisms localized in a light cone  @xmath25 do not change if one proceeds to larger cones @xmath778 .",
    "in contrast , for charges related to a local gauge group , such as the electric charge , the intertwiners depend on @xmath778 . thus , from the present point of view , there is a clear cut distinction between these two types of charges .",
    "this prompts us to ask the intriguing question of whether this feature can be used to recover both the global gauge group and the structure of the underlying local gauge group from the structure of the charged states .",
    "this would solve a longstanding problem in the algebraic approach to local quantum physics @xcite .",
    "the present investigation establishes a new framework for interpreting physical states in relativistic quantum field theory . instead of implicitly supposing that the properties of physical states can be controlled in all of minkowski space",
    ", we have from the outset taken the arrow of time into account : missing measurements and operations in the past in general mean missing information in the future . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the best physicists can hope for is to explore the properties of ( partial ) states in future light cones .",
    "theory only needs to interpret and explain such data .    in a completely massive world",
    ", our present approach would not make a difference as the observables in any forward light cone would be irreducible .",
    "so one would not loose information about states by belated experiments .",
    "the situation is different , however , in the presence of massless particles .",
    "since , as a consequence of huygens principle and einstein causality , there is no way of acquiring information on outgoing massless particles ( radiation ) created in the past of a light cone , the family of observables in a light cone is highly reducible .",
    "although there are numerous possibilities for the type of the algebra generated by these observables , they are generically of type  iii@xmath3 according to the classification of connes .    from a physical point of view , this type comes closest to the familiar irreducible case as it still allows to describe in a comprehensive way the transitive quantum effects of physical operations on states carrying the same charge .",
    "so although the superposition principle no longer holds for states on these algebras , concepts familiar from the analysis of superselection sectors such as the creation and transport of charges , their statistics and their conjugation still make good sense . moreover , their energetic aspects can be consistently described .",
    "the advantage of the present approach is that the infrared problems caused by infinite clouds of low energy massless particles disappear . in the traditional treatment one",
    "tries to solve these problems by splitting the massless particle content into an energetically soft and therefore unobservable part and a hard part .",
    "this method , however , breaks lorentz invariance and is incompatible with the strict locality of the observables . in the present approach the massless particle content",
    "is split into a marginal part defying observation since it is already in the spacelike complement of the observer and an elemental part accessible to observations and operations within his lightcone .",
    "this splitting is both lorentz invariant and compatible with einstein causality .",
    "it thereby permits a consistent description and analysis of elementary systems even in the presence of long range forces .    since the present approach does not aim to treat the marginal part of the outgoing massless particles it even admits unitary implementations of lorentz transformations for charged light cone morphisms .",
    "thus it is worthwhile posing the question of whether electrically charged states can be described as wigner particles ( irreducible representations of the poincar group ) in the present setting .",
    "such a result seems not to conflict with previous insights into minkowski theories @xcite where spacelike asymptotic properties do matter but have no counterpart in the present approach . since in a light cone",
    "the observed massless contributions can be described by fock states with a finite particle number there may be partial states , describing a single electrically charged particle where the ( globally inevitable ) accompanying radiation field has no observable effects in the cone .",
    "such states could well contribute to an atomic part in the mass spectrum .",
    "thus the infraparticle problem , too , may disappear if one just allows observations in a light cone .",
    "one of the most intriguing aspects of the present approach is the endomorphic nature of time evolution , entering as it does in the interpretation of the microscopic theory .",
    "this feature , combined with the perpetual loss of control of outgoing massless particles might be relevant to a better understanding of the classical aspects of our quantum world .",
    "observations on outgoing radiation can not be affected anymore by later quantum experiments ( unless the observer has taken timely precautions to reflect it back into his light cone ) .",
    "hence those results can be taken as facts in the sense of classical physics without conflicting with the principles of quantum theory .",
    "this aspect seems to warrant a more detailed study .    in the present analysis ,",
    "we have restricted attention to simple charges satisfying bose or fermi statistics . just as in the case of localizable charges in minkowski space , substantial parts of our analysis",
    "can be extended to the more general case of charges of arbitrary finite statistics with one notable exception : we have not been able to show that the property of covariance of composite morphisms is stable under forming subrepresentations and to establish the spectrum condition . since the physically successful theories coupling matter to the electromagnetic field",
    "do not lead to parastatistics there might be a deeper reason for our failure .",
    "but caution is needed in drawing such a conclusion and we will pursue this question elsewhere .",
    "in this appendix we establish the geometric facts about hypercones used in the preceding analysis .",
    "let @xmath26 be minkowski space equipped with the metric @xmath801 and coordinates @xmath802 .",

    "let @xmath845 for given @xmath831 .",
    "as the set of hypercones is stable under lorentz transformations we may suppose the apex of  @xmath860 is the centre of @xmath821 .",
    "let @xmath859 be the boundary of @xmath860 and let @xmath957 .",
    "there are boosts @xmath953 with , @xmath207 , inducing the action @xmath958 on @xmath821 , where @xmath959 is the component of @xmath960 orthogonal to @xmath961 .",
    "thus the apex @xmath962 of  @xmath860 is shifted in the direction of @xmath961 into the cone  @xmath860 and the points of @xmath863 are moved along great circles towards @xmath957 . since  @xmath863 is convex , the boosts induce contractions of  @xmath863 and consequently map @xmath860 into itself .",

    "since the boosts move @xmath860 towards the boundary @xmath863 and  @xmath861 is relatively compact , the two regions become disjoint for sufficiently large @xmath207 . but this implies , completing the proof .",

    "the action of arbitrary lorentz transformations @xmath55 induced on @xmath821 is given by ( choosing coordinates properly ) @xmath964 since @xmath965 this induced action is norm continuous on @xmath821 in the euclidean topology .",

    "we first suppose @xmath842 to be the causal completion of a special type of hyperbolic cone @xmath827 made up of hyperbolic rays given , choosing coordinates suitably , by with @xmath968 and @xmath957 , where @xmath859 is any convex set whose closure is contained in a hemisphere .",

    "a suitable lorentz transformation @xmath561 shifts its apex to the point @xmath984 and @xmath985 is then of the special type considered in the preceding step . the given set of translations is mapped to @xmath986 . since @xmath987 is bounded , there is a time translation @xmath988 as above with @xmath989 . since the points @xmath990 on the hyperboloid",
