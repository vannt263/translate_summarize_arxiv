    "in this paper we consider dirichlet and related problems , with rapidly oscillating data .",
    "although we treat the case of laplace equation , our analysis straightforwardly extends to general cases for equations that admit a poisson / green representation .",
    "such integral representation , in turn , reduces the study of the problem to the corresponding integral equation , and hence the analysis of the integral of rapidly oscillating functions becomes central .    to fix ideas ,",
    "let @xmath2 be a @xmath4 surface in @xmath5 @xmath6 , not necessarily bounded .",
    "we assume @xmath1 is integrable in both variables over @xmath2 , and @xmath7-periodic in @xmath8-variable i.e. , @xmath9 for @xmath10 . in this paper",
    ", we shall study possible limit behaviors of the integral @xmath11 and we shall prove that under mild conditions on the surface @xmath2 there is an effective limit as @xmath12 tends to zero .    in general we show that the above integrals stay within the bounds of the interval @xmath13 $ ] where @xmath14 are defined below , as the infimum respectively supremum of the average - integrals of @xmath15 over closed loops of the plane @xmath16 on the torus ; here @xmath17 denotes the normal vector of @xmath2 at @xmath8 .    to illuminate the application of this to the dirichlet problem , let us consider a bounded @xmath4-domain @xmath18 @xmath6 .",
    "let further @xmath1 and @xmath19 be continuous in both variables , and periodic in @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath20 be a solution to the dirichlet problem @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a @xmath4 surface compactly in @xmath24 .    since solutions to this problem",
    "can be represented by surface integrals of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( through poisson and green functions ) , we may directly apply our results .",
    "hence , a by - product of our surface integral homogenization , is nontrivial limit scenarios , as @xmath12 tends to zero , of equation ( [ eq - main - le ] ) and its solution .",
    "it is noteworthy that , through integral equations of fredholm type , or just standard functional minimization , our technique applies to homogenizations with oscillating neumann data ( see section [ neumann ] ) .",
    "for fully nonlinear operator the neumann problem has been treated in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "another issue that occurs along such analysis is the study of the speed of convergence . in problems , where governing partial differential equations have oscillating coefficients",
    ", one uses the standard method of expansion @xmath27 in an appropriate space . here",
    "@xmath28 is the so - called boundary layer term , and finding it is part of the problem .",
    "the function @xmath28 will then solve a dirichlet problem with oscillating boundary data .",
    "we refer to @xcite for some backgrounds and to @xcite for recent developments in the topic .",
    "it is noteworthy that our approach applies to general equations of the type @xmath29 with oscillating dirichlet / neumann data .",
    "this , even though straightforward , becomes quite technical and is therefore outside the scope of this paper .",
    "thus for clarity of the exposition we shall treat the laplacian case , only .",
    "let us set @xmath30 if @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and adopt the standard notation from homogenization , as well as that of ergodic theory .    for clarity of the ideas ,",
    "let us also deal with problem ( [ eq - main - le ] ) in the case @xmath33 , and see how it reduces to the integral averaging , and then how the limit integral is obtained .",
    "since harmonic functions can be represented using poisson kernel @xmath34 , @xmath35 we must then analyze the behavior of this integrals as @xmath12 tends to zero .    for @xmath36",
    ", @xmath34 is continuous and we can rewrite the integral @xmath37 where @xmath38 is small enough , independent of @xmath12 , and @xmath39 is a cube with size @xmath38 and center @xmath40 .",
    "this obviously brings us to integral ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "observe that at this stage we can not replace the second variable of @xmath25 with @xmath40 , due to rapid oscillation for @xmath41 .",
    "further assume that @xmath42 is so flat that at @xmath43-scale it is approximately @xmath44-away from its tangent plane ; this requires a @xmath45-graph locally , but our techniques / proofs work for @xmath4-surfaces .",
    "the idea now is to cover the boundary @xmath42 with finite many , and small enough cubes , so that each part of the surfaces is as flat as we want to .",
    "in particular we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is to be chosen small enough .",
    "this part is slightly more delicate , and needs extra care .",
    "we would also prefer to take @xmath48 .",
    "the trouble is that this might not work , as the points are changing , and we may loose lots of information about the behavior of the surface @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , an scaling of the integral gives @xmath50 and the question is whether this integral will converge to the mean @xmath51 .",
    "this would happen exactly when the normal vector of the surface @xmath52 at @xmath53 is irrational . in other words",
    "the surface @xmath54 ( which is almost a plane ) will foliate the @xmath55-dimensional torus , as @xmath12 tends to zero , provided we have chosen @xmath56 , and the normal vector of the surface @xmath52 at @xmath53 is irrational .",
    "in particular @xmath57 if the set of points on @xmath52 with rational direction has zero surface measure ( this may fail if there are so - called flat spots with rational directions ) then we could cover the boundary with small cubes centered at points with irrational normals . from here combining ( [ poison])-([1-lim ] ) we obtain @xmath58    it is apparent that if there is a flat portion of the boundary with rational normal , then a full foliation can not take place at such portions .",
    "consequently , the resulting ( mod   1 ) surface will be a close simple curve over the @xmath55-dimensional torus .",
    "hence different sequence of @xmath43 may give different shifts of this close loop , and hence the possibility of a parameter family of values , in between @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "* a word of caution : * as @xmath12 tends to zero , one may obviously rescale the integral , by a change of variables , as we did in our heuristic explanations above .",
    "this scaling makes the surface to be scaled ( we assume the origin is not on the surface ) so as to disappear in the limit .",
    "this naturally would make it impossible to compute the limit integral .",
    "however , the periodicity of the function @xmath25 in its second variable , implies that we can bring back the surface so as it passes through the fundamental cube @xmath60 using ( mod1 ) argument . in particular",
    "this means that despite the integration is on a fixed surface , the surface itself will start jumping forth and back due to the variable @xmath12 .",
    "it would be a good idea for the reader to consider simple examples such as integration over a line segment in the plane , by varying the normal direction of the plan from rational to irrational .      in the next section we shall introduce all definitions and notations .",
    "we take care of some technicalities in section [ tech - tools ] .",
    "we shall formulate our main results concerning surface integration in section [ main - results ] , and its generalization to other type of functions , such as layered - densities , almost periodic functions will appear in section [ general - densities ] .",

    "henceforth we shall assume all vectors have length one , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we shall also without loss of generality assume that the surface is orientable , and fix a consistent choice of normal in clockwise direction ( this choice is obvious if @xmath2 is the boundary of a domain ) .",
    "it should be noted that if the set @xmath70 foliates the cube @xmath71 then the integral @xmath72 converges to the average @xmath73 , and this happens exactly when @xmath74 is irrational direction ( see lemma [ lem - av ] ) .",
    "when the set @xmath70 does not foliate the cube @xmath71 ( or the @xmath55-dimensional torus ) then we shall get the limit as an integral over a closed loop flow on the torus .",
    "in particular the value of the integral exists , and depends on @xmath61 and @xmath43 . for different values of @xmath43",
    "this loop translates over the torus and will give rise to supremum respectively infimum values of the integrals , as defined above by @xmath75 , respectively .",
