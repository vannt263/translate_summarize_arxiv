    "our observations and analysis ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contradict such a picture @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that the density of high energy ( @xmath39  mev ) cosmic rays is approximately uniform over the galaxy because of their long mean free paths .",
    "the uniform distribution on the sky of diffuse @xmath40 ray emission appears to lend support to this ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent detailed calculations by @xcite typically give a 20  % variation depending on location and time .",
    "however , the situation is very different for low - energy cosmic rays , which are the most important for ionization of the gas ; their energy densities can vary greatly depending on proximity to local cosmic sources @xcite because of their short mean free paths .",
    "for example , a proton of 2  mev , which effectively ionizes hydrogen , travels only 3  pc before losing its energy in a medium with @xmath41 = 100  @xmath5 @xcite . the ionization rate by low - energy cosmic rays could be proportional to the number density of the accelerating sources ( snrs ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and therefore have strong local variations .",
    "if the energy density of cosmic - rays follows the surface density of ob stars , the cosmic ray ionization rate would be an order of magnitude higher in the galactic center than in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite called for an even higher local enhancement of low - energy cosmic rays in the galactic center ( @xmath42 s@xmath8 to @xmath43s@xmath8 ! ) to account for the iron fluorescence line at 6.4  kev .",
    "such values are much larger than those derived in the previous section using h@xmath31 . x - rays and far ultraviolet radiation from stars may also increase @xmath6 .",
    "a factor of 10 or higher increase of @xmath6 due to x - ray emission has even been reported in the circumstellar disk of a low mass star @xcite .",
    "the enhancements could be large for the cmz , where there are abundant intense emitters of x - rays and euv radiation .",
    "for the above high values of @xmath6 , @xmath9 would be quite short if eq .",
    "( 2 ) is applied . however , there are two arguments against adopting such high values of @xmath6 . first ,",
    "as argued earlier , the observed high velocity dispersion of h@xmath31 indicates that the gas is quite extensive rather than confined in many small clumps .",
    "this indicates that there are non - local sources of ionization covering an extensive region .",
    "second , the results of eqs .  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are based on a simple linear formalism , which is a good approximation for low @xmath6 . for",
    "much higher @xmath6 this should be replaced by higher order non - linear formalism in which @xmath44(h@xmath31 ) no longer increases proportionally to @xmath6 , but tends to saturate .",
    "one source of such nonlinearity , revealed by @xcite , is the dissociative recombination of h@xmath45 , h@xmath45 + e@xmath46 @xmath20 h + h , which competes with the h@xmath31 production reaction h@xmath45 + h@xmath23 @xmath20 h@xmath31 + h. the former reaction , in addition to the dissociative recombination of h@xmath31 , reduces the h@xmath31 concentration twice .",
    "it also increases @xmath33(h ) and decreases @xmath37 , hence the non - linearity . in an example given in the lower figure of fig .",
    "3 of @xcite , a ten times increase of @xmath6 from 10@xmath47 s@xmath8 to 10@xmath7 s@xmath8 leads to only a fourfold increase of h@xmath31 ( the saturation is more severe for the upper figure ) .",
    "the importance of saturation depends sensitively on the value of @xmath37 , the fractional abundance of h@xmath23 .",
    "another source of non - linear behavior is the production of h through dissociation of h@xmath23 by cosmic rays , x - rays , and euv radiation .",
    "the rates of these processes are comparable to the rate of ionization @xcite .",
    "since the reproduction of h@xmath23 on dust grains is slow , h accumulates in the gas and the charge exchange reaction , h@xmath45 + h @xmath20 h@xmath23 + h@xmath24 , which has a high rate constant of 6.4  @xmath36  10@xmath48  @xmath49  s@xmath8 , will compete with the h@xmath31 producing reaction introducing additional non - linearity .",
    "the increase of @xmath33(h ) and resulting reduction of @xmath37 affect the gas in several other ways , all of which make the increase of @xmath6 ineffective in increasing @xmath0 .",
    "while more detailed treatments of these nonlinearities have yet to be worked out , it seems unlikely to us that @xmath6 can be larger than @xmath17 3 @xmath36 10@xmath7 s@xmath8 over extensive portions of the cmz .",
    "small volumes with higher @xmath6 may well exist in the cmz , but they would not necessarily produce a large fraction of the observed h@xmath50 .      the sight line toward gc  irs  3 is special in that at @xmath5150  km  s@xmath8 lsr it has a detectable population of h@xmath31 in the unstable ( 2,2 )  level in addition to the large populations in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) levels .",
    "also this is the only case for which the population in the ( 3,3 ) metastable level is definitely higher than in the ( 1,1 ) ground level ( see @xmath44(3,3)/@xmath44(1,1 ) in table 4 ) .",
    "the observable population in the ( 2,2 ) level indicates a high density and the larger population in the ( 3,3 ) level than in the ( 1,1 ) level indicates high temperature environment .",
    "our analysis yields @xmath33  =  175    300 @xmath5 and @xmath3  =  350",
    "  500  k. as seen from fig .  4 , this environment is clearly distinct from those elsewhere .",
    "we speculate below on two possible locations for this gas : ( 1 ) the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) and , ( 2 ) the `` 50  km  s@xmath8 cloud '' behind the gc .",
    "gc  irs  3 is only 5  ( 0.2  pc ) from sgr  a@xmath32 , which is well within the projected span of the central cluster ( the maximum transverse separation of bright stars in the cluster is @xmath170.65  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the central 3  pc of the gc contains hot , high density gas which shows intricate mini - spiral structures @xcite termed the western arc , the northern arm , the eastern arm , and the bar @xcite .",
    "the extension of the western arc has been associated with a nearly completely circular , keplerian circumnuclear disk by analysis of hcn radio emission @xcite and by other methods ; recent direct observations of the disk via its far infrared dust emission by @xcite are particularly noteworthy .",
    "there also have been attempts to interpret other three mini - spirals as cnds which are not necessarily elliptical ( * ? ? ?",

    "* e. g. ) .",
    "gc  irs  3 is located in the cavity between the northern arm and the bar , a region of low gas density .",
    "h. s. liszt ( private communication ) has suggested that the absorption at @xmath5150  km  s@xmath8 in fig .  5 of @xcite may be due to the same cloud producing the h@xmath31 absorption in the sightline toward gc  irs  3 .",
    "not only does the velocity match , but also the high velocity gradient of 100  km  s@xmath8 arcmin@xmath8 found by @xcite is consistent with the width of the h@xmath31 50  km  s@xmath8 absorption feature .    however , there are two possible problems with this interpretation .",
    "first , it calls for an uncomfortably high cosmic ionization rate in order to account for the observed h@xmath31 column density in the short path length within the cnd . assuming a path length on the order of 0.5 pc , the observed ( @xmath6@xmath9)@xmath34 of 7.5 @xmath36 10@xmath11  cm  s@xmath8 in table  [ tb4 ] gives @xmath6  @xmath17  2  @xmath36  10@xmath52  s@xmath8 , an extremely high value .",
    "such a value is possible @xcite in view of the high density of stars and radiation field in the region , but in such conditions the higher order chemistry @xcite discussed in section 5.3 .",
    "surely plays a role .",
    "although the detection of h@xmath31 in the unstable ( 2,2 ) level indicates higher density compared with other sight lines , the population of the ( 3,3 ) level is still much higher and the distribution is highly non - thermal .",
    "the density is definitely much lower than that reported for the cnd ( 10@xmath11",
    "  10@xmath12  @xmath5 ) .",
    "this could be due to the fact that gc  irs  3 is in the northern cavity and is only behind the edge of the cnd rather than its densest regions .",
    "the second problem is the absence of the @xmath1(2,2)@xmath2 line in the spectrum of gc  irs  1w .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath1(2,2)@xmath2 line is detected toward gc  irs  3 , but not toward gc  irs  1w which is just 84 apart , or 0.31  pc for a common distance of 7.6  kpc @xcite .",
    "if both stars belong to the central cluster @xcite , it is not likely that they are much more than 0.5  pc apart .",
    "although the source might well be located in the foreground , gc  irs  1w overlaps with the high density part of the northern arm , while gc  irs  3 is located in the cavity .",
    "it is difficult to understand why only gc  irs  3 shows @xmath1(2,2)@xmath2 absorption , if the absorption occurs within the cnd .",
    "the observed velocity of @xmath5150  km  s@xmath8 toward gc  irs3 immediately suggests that the absorption might arise in the well known `` 50  km  s@xmath8 cloud '' , one of the giant molecular clouds ( @xmath53 ) located near the galactic center .",
    "the `` 50  km  s@xmath8 cloud '' is sometimes referred to as m@xmath540.02@xmath540.07 , or was called the `` 40  km  s@xmath8 cloud '' by @xcite , and has been discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "many atomic and molecular studies have established that it is located _ behind _ the galactic nucleus , in between the non - thermal radio source sgr  a east ( snr ) and the region sgr  a west , which enshrouds the central star cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the several masers they discovered in the southeast of sgr  a@xmath32 are excited in the shock - heated interface between sgr  a  east and m@xmath540.02@xmath540.07 , where the expanding supernova remnant hits the giant molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite also found clues for an interaction between sgr  a  east and the `` 50  km  s@xmath8 cloud '' in the high velocity wings of cs @xmath55 , although it may not be the case that the `` 50  km  s@xmath8 cloud '' is the sole cloud that falls in the radial velocity @xmath5150  km  s@xmath8 in the line of sight toward the galactic center @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that gc  irs  3 and irs  7 show deep absorption lines of the co fundamental band at 4.7  @xmath56 m at the radial velocity @xmath5150  km  s@xmath8 , while gc  irs  1 and irs  2 do not .",
    "they attributed the @xmath5150  km  s@xmath8 absorption to the cnd but also mentioned the possibility that gc  irs  3 is not a member of the central cluster , but behind the @xmath5150  km  s@xmath8 cloud and thus not in the central cluster .",
    "the nature of gc  irs  3 is controversial @xcite ; it is among the brightest sources in the central cluster region only less lumnous than gc  irs  1 and gc  irs  10 , and much redder than them in the mid - infrared even though it is ( apparently ) in the cavity .",
    "because of its location and featureless infrared continuum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gc  irs  3 has widely been believed to be a hot massive star heavily obscured by its own dust ( similar to the bright quintuplet sources ) , in addition to foreground dust .",
    "however , new interferometric observation that resolve the circumstellar dust shell have been interpreted by @xcite as evidence that the central object is a late - type carbon star , the photospheric spectral features of which are completely obscured .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the apparent lack of ionization of the circumstellar shell , which one might expect if the object lies within the central cluster , and indeed the lack of ionized gas near gc  irs  3 @xcite .",
    "although somewhat unlikely due to its proximity on the plane of the sky to the central cluster , the placement of gc  irs  3 well behind the cluster and the `` @xmath5150  km  s@xmath8 cloud '' is otherwise a straightforward assignment and avoids the difficulties associated with the cnd hypothesis mentioned in the previous section .      during the 2005 royal society discussion meeting on h@xmath31 @xcite , j. h.",

    "\\(5 ) various arguments suggest @xmath6 is on the order of 10@xmath7 s@xmath8 and @xmath9 on the order of 50 pc in the cmz , indicating a high ionization rate in the region and a high volume filling factor of the gas .",
