    "the measurement of open charm and open beauty production allows to investigate the mechanisms of heavy - quark production , propagation and hadronization in the hot and dense medium formed in high - energy nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions .",
    "heavy - quark production measurements in proton  proton collisions at the lhc energy of @xmath1 , besides providing the necessary baseline for the study of medium effects in nucleus  nucleus collisions , are interesting _ per se _ , as a test of qcd in a new energy domain .",
    "heavy - quark pairs ( @xmath2 ) are expected to be produced in primary partonic scatterings with large virtuality @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the baseline production cross sections in nucleon  nucleon collisions can be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . for the estimate of baseline production yields in nuclear collisions , scaling of the yields with the average number of inelastic nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions is usually assumed .",
    "the expected @xmath4 and @xmath5 production yields for pp collisions at @xmath1 are 0.16 and 0.0072 , respectively  @xcite . for the 5% most central pb ",
    "pb collisions at @xmath0 the expected yields are 115 and 4.6 , respectively .",
    "these numbers , assumed as the baseline for alice simulation studies , are obtained from pqcd calculations at nlo  @xcite , including the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs )  @xcite in the pb nucleus ( details on the choice of pqcd parameter values and pdf sets can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "note that the predicted yields have large uncertainties , of about a factor 2 , estimated by varying the values of the calculation parameters .",
    "an illustration of the theoretical uncertainty bands for the d and b meson cross sections will be shown in sections  [ opencharm ] and [ openbeautyele ] , along with the expected sensitivity of the alice experiment .",
    "the alice experimental setup , described in detail in  @xcite , allows the detection of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons in the high - multiplicity environment of central  collisions at lhc energy , where a few thousand charged particles might be produced per unit of rapidity .",
    "the heavy - flavour capability of the alice detector is provided by :    * tracking system ; the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the transition radiation detector ( trd ) , embedded in a magnetic field of @xmath8  t , allow track reconstruction in the pseudorapidity range @xmath9 with a momentum resolution better than 2% for @xmath10 and a transverse impact parameter , is defined as the distance of closest approach of the track to the interaction vertex , in the plane transverse to the beam direction . ]",

    "among the most promising channels for open charm detection are the @xmath17 ( @xmath42 , branching ratio @xmath43 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath44 , branching ratio @xmath45 ) decays . the detection strategy to cope with the large combinatorial background from the underlying event",
    "is based on the selection of displaced - vertex topologies , i.e. separation from the primary vertex of the tracks from the secondary vertex and good alignment between the reconstructed d meson momentum and flight - line  @xcite .",

    "pb ) are expected to be smaller than 20% .    for the case of pp collisions ,",
    "the experimental errors on the @xmath46-differential cross section are expected to be significantly smaller than the current theoretical uncertainty from perturbative qcd calculations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0ptcmp ] we superimpose the simulated alice measurement points for the @xmath47 in pp collisions to the prediction bands from the mnr fixed - order massive calculation  @xcite and from the fonll fixed - order next - to - leading log calculation  @xcite .",

    "such decays have a branching ratio of @xmath53 ( plus 10% from cascade decays @xmath54 , that only populate the low-@xmath46 region in the electron spectrum ) .",
    "the main sources of background electrons are : decays of d mesons ; @xmath55 dalitz decays and decays of light vector mesons ( e.g.@xmath56 and @xmath57 ) ; conversions of photons in the beam pipe or in the inner detector layer and pions misidentified as electrons . given that electrons from beauty have average impact parameter @xmath58 and a hard @xmath46 spectrum , it is possible to obtain a high - purity sample with a strategy that relies on : electron identification with a combined @xmath15 ( tpc ) and transition radiation ( trd ) selection ; impact parameter cut to reduce the charm - decay component and reject misidentified @xmath59 and @xmath60 from dalitz decays and @xmath61 conversions . as an example , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the expected statistics of electrons from b decays is @xmath64 for @xmath36 central events , allowing the measurement of electron - level @xmath46-differential cross section in the range @xmath65 with statistical errors smaller than 15% at high @xmath46 .",
