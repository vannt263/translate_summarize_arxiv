    "soon after the discovery of josephson effects , it was realized that josephson junction can be used to generate electromagnetic waves .",
    "when the junction is biased in voltage state with voltage @xmath1 , the two superconducting electrodes have energy difference @xmath2 .",
    "the system is similar to two - energy level system in atomic physics . when cooper pairs tunnel from the electrode with higher energy to that with lower energy , a photon with angular frequency @xmath3 is emitted .",
    "the frequency can be tuned by voltage and @xmath4 mv corresponds to @xmath5 thz .",
    "the radiation power from one junction however is weak , of the order of 1 pw .",
    "@xcite arrays of josephson junctions are fabricated to enhance the radiation power@xcite . once these junctions are synchronized , the total radiation power is proportional to the number of junctions squared .",
    "a stack of josephson junctions is naturally realized in some layered cuprate superconductor@xcite , such as @xmath6 ( bscco ) . because of the large superconducting energy gap ( 60 mev ) , these build - in intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijjs ) may have josephson oscillations with frequencies in the terahertz ( thz ) band .",
    "ijjs are packed on nanometer scale , much smaller than thz electromagnetic ( em ) wavelength , and are homogeneous . the thz generator based on ijjs",
    "thus is promising to fill the thz gap@xcite .",
    "lots of effort has been made to excite the coherent thz radiation experimentally in the last decade @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , numerical simulations and analytical calculations are performed to understand the mechanism of radiation .",
    "@xcite    coherent radiations from a mesa structure of bscco in the absence external magnetic fields were observed experimentally in 2007@xcite , which renewed the interest in this field .",
    "it was found that the mesa itself forms a cavity to synchronize the radiation in different layers , as evidenced from the dependence of the radiation frequency @xmath7 on the lateral size @xmath8 of the mesa , @xmath9 with @xmath10 the josephson plasma velocity where @xmath11 is the dielectric constant of bscco .",
    "the cavity resonance mechanism has been confirmed by many independent experiments@xcite and the radiation power is enhanced to about @xmath12.@xcite a dynamic state with @xmath13 phase kink was proposed to account for the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the strong in - plane dissipation is responsible for the excitation of cavity mode uniform along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "@xcite    from application perspective , the radiation power in the present experimental design is still too weak to be practically useful . a natural way to enhance the radiation power by using thicker mesas has several challenges .",
    "first , for a thick mesa it becomes difficult to cool the system efficiently .",
    "the dissipation hence self - heating increases with the volume of the mesa , while the heat removal rate remains the same because the heat is mainly removed through the substrate .",
    "it has already shown experimentally that even for a mesa with thickness of @xmath15 , central part of the meas is driven to the normal state by the severe self - heating.@xcite .",
    "secondly , it was calculated that for a tall mesa a long - range instability destroying the in - phase plasma oscillations develops@xcite , and only parts of the mesa can be synchronized.@xcite    to enhance the radiation power while minimizing the self - heating , one may use multiple thin mesas on top of the same bscco single crystal .",
    "the multiple mesa structure has been fabricated recently and the radiation power is enhanced under appropriate conditions as demonstrated in the recent experiments.@xcite the mechanism of synchronization among mesas is not known .",
    "there are two sources of interaction .",
    "the mesas interact through the radiation fields .",
    "they also interact through the plasma oscillations in the base crystal .",
    "the resonance damping due to the leaking of radiation from the mesa into the base crystal has been considered in ref . and it was demonstrated that this channel gives the main contribution to the dissipation . therefore , synchronization mediated by radiation fields inside crystal is probably a dominating mechanism .",
    "the present work is devoted to understanding the synchronization of multiple mesas through plasma oscillations in the base crystal and to finding an optimal configuration for synchronization .",
    "we consider arrays of identical mesas with the period @xmath16 atop of bscco single crystal as schematically shown in fig .",
    "every mesa contains @xmath17 junctions and has width @xmath8 while the base crystal contains @xmath18 junctions . no external magnetic field",
    "is applied to the bscco .",
    "each mesa is biased independent by a dc current injected from top of the mesa and extracted from the sides of the mesa . in this case , the junctions in the basal crystal remain zero - voltage state , and the mesas are driven into resistive state . the system is assumed to be uniform along the @xmath19 direction and the problem becomes two dimensional .",
    "the dynamics of the gauge invariant phase difference @xmath20 and magnetic field @xmath21 in the @xmath22-th junction are described by @xcite @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the finite difference operator . here the time and coordinate are measured in units of the inverse josephson plasma frequency @xmath26 and the josephson length @xmath27 correspondingly and the unit of magnetic field is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the anisotropy factor and @xmath30 is the interlayer spacing . here @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the flux quantum .",
    "these reduced equations depend on three parameters , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the quasiparticle conductivity , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the london penetration depth along the @xmath14-axis and @xmath40-plane respectively .",
    "the dimensionless electric field is given by @xmath41 , with @xmath42 in unit of @xmath43 .",
    "for the mesa with thickness of @xmath44 which is much smaller than the wave length of thz em wave in vacuum , there is a significant impedance mismatch between the mesa and vacuum@xcite .",
    "most part of energy is reflected at the edges of mesa and cavity resonance is achieved .",
    "we can use the boundary condition that the oscillating magnetic field vanishes at the edges .",
    "the boundary condition at the edges of the mesas is @xmath45 , and the boundary condition at the edges of the base crystal is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the bias current in the @xmath48-th mesa .",
    "we assume that the ijjs stack is sandwiched by good conductors , such that the tangential current inside the conductor is zero , which corresponds to the boundary condition @xmath49 in the continuum limit .",
    "in this section , we calculate the plasma oscillations and its dissipation in the synchronized state assuming that the array contains large number of mesas so that it can be treated as an infinite system .",

    "let us first consider two identical mesas with width @xmath128 and with a separation @xmath129 .",

    "the peak at @xmath138 is due to the cavity resonance inside the mesa .",
    "however the resonance occurs at smaller @xmath139 compared to that with @xmath140 .",
    "the downshift is due to the strong radiation damping through the base crystal as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .    the reasons for the better coherence when @xmath135 are as follows .",
    "for the plasma oscillations uniform along the @xmath14 axis @xmath141 , the in - plane dissipation is absent and the plasma is damped by the weak dissipation along the @xmath14-axis according to eq .",
    "( [ qm ] ) .",
    "however , for nonuniform oscillations with a finite wavenumber @xmath142 , the in - plane dissipation becomes dominant for @xmath143 , and the nonuniform plasma oscillations in the base crystal decays quickly .",
    "therefore the interaction between two mesas is weak and the synchronization becomes difficult .",
    "when @xmath144 , uniform cavity modes @xmath141 are possible as shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "two mesas then are strongly coupled through the base crystal and they are synchronized . when @xmath145 , only nonuniform modes can be excited and the plasma oscillations in the base crystal is strongly damped by the in - plane dissipation .",
    "the amplitude of plasma oscillations is small compared to that when @xmath144 , see fig . [ f6](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "thus synchronization between mesas is hard to attain .",
    "therefore the maximal synchronization is achieved when the position and size of mesas are commensurate with the standing wave in the base crystal , because the nonuniform plasma oscillations decay quickly in the base crystal .",
    "let us consider the phase shift of the gauge invariant phase difference between edges of mesas . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f6](a ) , the supercurrent changes sign from the left edge to the right edge in the same mesa .",
    "this indicates there is a @xmath13 phase jump at the center of the mesa , and the @xmath13 phase kink is excited at the cavity resonance@xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 phase kink helps to pump energy into the plasma oscillations and the amplitude of the oscillations is enhanced sharply at the cavity resonances , as described by the term at the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqmesaph ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ f6](a ) and ( b ) , the plasma oscillations at the left / right edges have the same phase between different stacks when @xmath146 . for @xmath147 , there is @xmath13 phase shift between two mesas to match the standing wave in the base crystal .    in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , the voltage of mesas with @xmath148 when they are biased by different current @xmath149 is shown . at the cavity resonance",
    "when two mesas are synchronized , they have the same voltage despite that they are biased by slightly different current .",
    "away from the cavity resonance , two mesas decouple from each other and they oscillate at different frequency .",
    "we have investigated the synchronization of mesa array through the plasma oscillations in the base crystal .",
    "if one regards the mesa arrays and base crystal as a whole , the plasma oscillations inside depends on the configuration of mesa arrays as a result of geometrical resonance .",
    "the amplitude of the plasma oscillations and the tendency of synchronization is governed by the dissipation of the whole system , hence is determined by the configuration of mesa array . when the period of mesa array @xmath16 close to the multiple integer of the mesa width @xmath8 , @xmath150 , the dissipation is minimized and mesas are synchronized at cavity resonances of the whole system .",
    "alternatively , one may treat mesa and base crystal separately . when the cavity resonance of mesa matches of that in the base crystal , mesa array is synchronized .",
    "otherwise , the cavity resonance of the mesas is suppressed by the strong dissipation due to the radiation into the base crystal , and the mesa array is not synchronized .",
