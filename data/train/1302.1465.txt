    "in algebraic topology a classical object of study is the stable homotopy ring @xmath0 , which is @xmath1-graded and graded - commutative . for any topological space ( or spectrum ) @xmath2 the stable homotopy groups @xmath3 give a bimodule over @xmath0 .",
    "the motivation for the present paper comes from wanting to generalize this basic setup to more sophisticated homotopy theories , where the homotopy rings and modules have a more elaborate grading .",
    "standard examples are the categories of @xmath4-equivariant spectra and the category of motivic spectra . in these settings",
    "it has long been realized that it can be advantageous to use a grading by an index having to do with the invertible objects , rather than a grading by integers ( which correspond to integral suspensions / desuspensions of the unit object ) .",
    "this paper deals with some fundamental questions that arise in this general situation .",
    "as we explain below , for general grading schema one must take some care over whether the analog of @xmath0 is indeed associative , and whether the analogs of @xmath3 are indeed bimodules .",
    "care is also needed in the treatment of graded - commutativity . at an even deeper level than these issues ,",
    "the ring structure on @xmath0 is not exactly canonical ",
    "different choices in the basic setup can result in different isomorphism classes of rings .",
    "we approach these issues by proving a general coherence theorem for invertible objects in a symmetric monoidal category ; this is the main result of the paper , and is spread across theorems  [ th : coherence ] , [ th : coherence2 ] , [ th : multi - coherence1 ] , and [ th : multi - coherence2 ] below . after establishing the coherence",
    "result we deduce the basic facts about @xmath5-graded homotopy rings as consequences .",
    "let @xmath6 be a symmetric monoidal category , and let @xmath7 denote the unit .",
    "given objects @xmath8 in @xmath9 , we write @xmath10 as an abbreviation for @xmath11 we also use @xmath12 as an abbreviation for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 factors ) .",
    "so note that @xmath15 is an abbreviation for @xmath16 , and that by convention @xmath17 . finally , for each tuple @xmath18 , write @xmath19    an object @xmath2 of @xmath9 is called invertible if there is an object @xmath20 and an isomorphism @xmath21 .",
    "we will say that @xmath22 is an inverse for @xmath2 .",
    "in this situation there turns out to be a unique map @xmath23 such that the two evident maps from @xmath24 to @xmath2 are the same , and this @xmath25 is an isomorphism ( see proposition  [ pr : alpha - hat ] below ) .",
    "if @xmath26 define @xmath27 note that given an invertible object @xmath2 , the isomorphism type of @xmath20 is uniquely determined ; but given a specific choice of @xmath20 , the map @xmath28 is _ not _ uniquely determined  it can be varied by an arbitrary element of @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a collection of invertible objects in @xmath9 , with inverses @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath32 define @xmath33    assume now that @xmath9 is an additive category and that the tensor product is an additive functor in each variable .",
    "let @xmath0 be the @xmath5-graded abelian group given by @xmath34 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath35 is a fixed object in @xmath9 let @xmath36 be the @xmath5-graded abelian group given by @xmath37 .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is the following :    [ pr : main1 ]    1 .",
    "@xmath0 is a @xmath5-graded ring , 2 .",
    "@xmath36 is a @xmath5-graded bimodule over @xmath0 , and 3 .",
    "there exist elements @xmath38 satisfying @xmath39 such that for all @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , one has @xmath43.\\ ] ] in fact , @xmath44 is just the trace of the identity map on @xmath45 ( see section  [ se : kl ] for the definition of trace ) .",
    "the groups @xmath36 depend on the choice of objects @xmath30 , and therefore we should probably write @xmath46",
    ". we will always regard the sequence @xmath47 as being understood , however .",
    "unfortunately , the ring structure from ( 1 ) depends on even more than this : it depends on the choices of @xmath48 .",
    "given only the sequence @xmath47 , the number of isomorphism types of different ring structures is parameterized by the set @xmath49 .",
    "see proposition  [ pr : a ] below .    to see the difficulty in ( 1 ) , assume that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are two maps .",
    "of course we may tensor them together to form @xmath52 . however , this only yields an element in @xmath53 after choosing an isomorphism @xmath54 .",
    "the trouble is that there are many such isomorphisms , and we can not just choose one at random . to ensure that @xmath0 is associative these isomorphisms must be compatible in the sense that some evident pentagons all commute .",
    "both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) follow from the fact that one _ can _ choose such isomorphisms in a compatible way .",
    "this is not a particularly hard result , but it does require some care .",
    "the skew - commutativity in ( 3 ) is more difficult , and when exploring this one quickly realizes the desirability of a general coherence theory for invertible objects .",
    "this paper develops such a theory .",
    "let us say a little more about skew - commutativity .",
    "given an invertible object @xmath2 and a self - map @xmath55 , there is a well - defined invariant @xmath56 called the _ trace _ ( see section  [ se : kl ] ) .",
    "define @xmath57 and call this the basic commuter for the object @xmath2 .",
    "one can prove in this generality that @xmath58 and satisfies @xmath59 .",
    "in fact @xmath60 gives a homomorphism @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the group of isomorphism classes of invertible objects and @xmath63 denotes the @xmath64-torsion elements in @xmath29 .",
    "this homomorphism is a basic invariant of the symmetric monoidal category , and governs all commutativity issues .",
    "see section  [ se : inv ] for more information .",
    "the motivating examples for @xmath9 one may wish to keep in mind throughout the paper are :    * the @xmath4-equivariant stable homotopy category , where @xmath4 is a finite group ( or even a compact lie group ) . in this case",
    "let @xmath65 be a collection of finite - dimensional , irreducible , real representations for @xmath4 that represent every isomorphism type .",
    "let @xmath66 be the suspension spectra of the one - point compactifications . * the motivic stable homotopy category over some chosen ground ring . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are the two basic motivic spheres .",
    "the product on @xmath0 defined above might look different from the standard composition product that is used for stable homotopy groups .",
    "an easy argument shows that the products are , in fact , the same  see remark  [ re : comp ] .",
    "fix an invertible object @xmath2 with inverse @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath69 be a tensor word in @xmath2 and @xmath20 . as a specific example",
    ", let us look at the word @xmath70 . clearly @xmath71 , but there are different ways to construct such an isomorphism .",
    "we might use the chain @xmath72 where we used @xmath25 in the first isomorphism and @xmath28 in the second .",
    "or we might use the chain @xmath73 where we have used @xmath25 in both the first isomorphism and in the fourth .",
    "are these two composite isomorphisms the same ?",
    "are _ all _ composite isomorphisms the same ?",
    "the answer to the second question depends on how careful we are . if we allow ourselves to use the twist isomorphism @xmath74 then it is not necessarily true that all composite isomorphisms will be the same .",
    "however , if we agree not to use the twist then we obtain the following result :    [ th : coherence ] let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be two tensor words in the formal variables @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "suppose given two `` formal composites '' @xmath79 , by which we mean composable sequences of the following kinds of maps :    a.   associativity isomorphisms ; b.   unital isomorphisms @xmath80 ; c.   @xmath28 and @xmath25 ; d.   maps obtained from the above ones by tensoring with identity maps ; e.   inverses of any of the above maps .    then the maps @xmath81 and @xmath82 , obtained by substituting @xmath2 and @xmath20 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 and taking the actual composite in @xmath9 ,",
    "are equal .",
    "the awkwardness in the statement of the above proposition is commonplace in coherence results , because one has to eliminate certain accidental compositions from occurring .",
    "for example , suppose the invertible object @xmath2 happens to be its own inverse : i.e. , suppose @xmath83 .",
    "then both @xmath28 and @xmath84 are maps @xmath85 ; however , the theorem does not claim that they are the same map .",
    "indeed , on a formal level @xmath28 is a map @xmath86 and @xmath84 is a map @xmath87 , and so there is no choice of @xmath76 for which we can apply the theorem to these two maps .    to complement",
    "the above `` non - example '' of the proposition , here is a true application .",
    "consider the words @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "there are two formal compositions @xmath90 we can construct as follows : @xmath91 and @xmath92 &   x(y(xy))\\ar[r ] &   x ( ( y x ) y ) \\ar[r]^-{1{\\otimes}\\alpha^{-1}{\\otimes}1 }   &   x ( s y ) \\ar[r ] & x y \\ar[r]^{\\hat{\\alpha } } & s. } \\ ] ] note that we omitted the tensor symbols in the second composite for typographical reasons .",
    "the proposition guarantees that the corresponding composites give the same map in any symmetric monoidal category , for any invertible object @xmath2 and inverse @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath2 be an invertible object in @xmath9 with inverse @xmath22 . by a `` tensor word '' @xmath69 in @xmath2 and @xmath20 we can mean either a formal expression in the symbols `` @xmath2 '' and `` @xmath20 '' or the actual object that results when the expression is evaluated in @xmath9 .",
    "we will usually let the reader deduce the meaning from context , but occasionally we will write @xmath93 for the latter interpretation ",
    "the evaluation of the formal word @xmath69 inside of @xmath9 .",
    "formal tensor words are best thought of as functors into @xmath9 where the allowable inputs are pairs @xmath94 .",
    "consider the following statement : given a tensor word @xmath69 as above , there is a unique @xmath26 for which @xmath95 .",
    "this is true for formal tensor words , but not necessarily true for their evaluations in @xmath9 .",
    "for example , if our particular object @xmath2 is its own inverse ( @xmath83 ) then we have @xmath96 and so the value of @xmath97 is not unique .",
    "but it is not true that the formal word `` @xmath2 '' is isomorphic to the formal word `` @xmath98 '' .    keeping this nuance of language in mind",
    ", we can apply theorem  [ th : coherence ] as follows .",
    "given a formal word @xmath69 in @xmath2 and @xmath20 , there is a unique @xmath26 for which @xmath95 ( canonical isomorphism of functors ) and moreover the isomorphism can be chosen from the class described in theorem  [ th : coherence ] , in which case it is _ canonical_. in this paper such canonical isomorphisms will always be denoted @xmath99 .",
    "the provision of these canonical isomorphisms is one of the main uses of coherence .",
    "we will need a coherence theorem that is more sophisticated than theorem  [ th : coherence ] .",
    "to state this , imagine that one has formal words @xmath100 in @xmath77 and @xmath78 together with a string of maps @xmath101 we assume that each @xmath102 is one of the following :    a.   an associativity isomorphism ; b.   one of the unital isomorphisms @xmath80 ; c.   a twist map @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ; d.   either @xmath28 or @xmath25 ; e.   a map obtained from the above ones by tensoring with identity maps ; f.   an inverse of any of the above maps .",
    "let @xmath107 denote the tuple of @xmath108 s and @xmath102 s .",
    "define the parity of @xmath107 to be the total number of times @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 appear  that is , the number of @xmath113 s for which one of these maps appears as a tensor factor in @xmath102 .",
    "[ th : coherence2 ] let @xmath107 and @xmath114 be two strings as above , and let @xmath14 be the length of the first and @xmath115 the length of the second .",
    "assume that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath107 and @xmath114 have the same parity , then the composite of the @xmath102 s is equal to the composite of the @xmath118 s in any symmetric monoidal category , when @xmath77 and @xmath78 are replaced with an invertible object @xmath2 and an inverse @xmath22 .",
    "consider the composites @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath99 is the canonical isomorphism provided by theorem  [ th : coherence ] .",
    "then theorem  [ th : coherence2 ] states that these two composites are the same .",
    "an attempt to prove this directly will quickly demonstrate the nontriviality of theorem  [ th : coherence2 ] .",
    "now we turn to coherence theorems involving several different invertible objects .",

    "for each @xmath113 , let @xmath121 denote a chosen inverse for @xmath45 .",

    "it is clear that @xmath69 is formally isomorphic to @xmath123 for a uniquely determined @xmath32 .",
    "we want a result which says that different ways of constructing such an isomorphism yield the same result .    in our statements of the next two results we dispense with the phrasing about formal compositions and their instances inside of a given symmetric monoidal category .",
    "however , this language should be taken as implicit in the statements .",

    "another application of coherence is to relate these two elements :    [ eq : r = l ] [ f]_r=[f]_l_i^b_i(a_i - b_i )    where the @xmath44 s are the basic commuters of the @xmath45 s .",
    "this and many related formulas are developed in section  [ se : app ] .",
    "let us very briefly indicate the idea behind skew - commutativity .",

    "the content of proposition  [ pr : main1](c ) is the identification of @xmath158_r$ ] as a product of basic commuters ; this is a direct consequence of theorem  [ th : multi - coherence2 ] , which says that the associated composite @xmath159 is determined purely by the parities involved .",
    "see section  [ se : app ] for complete details .",
    "we close this long introduction with a very specific example . in the stable motivic homotopy category ( over a chosen ground field )",
    "there are two basic spheres denoted @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "these are invertible objects .",
    "more generally one sets @xmath162 , for any @xmath163 .",
    "the bigraded stable homotopy ring @xmath164 is an instance of the general situation considered in this paper , although unfortunately the bigrading is different from the generic bigrading we adopted for proposition  [ pr : main1 ] : the motivic group @xmath165 corresponds to what we have been calling @xmath166 .",
    "the basic commuter for @xmath160 is the element @xmath167 .",
    "the basic commuter for @xmath161 is represented by the twist map @xmath168 ; in motivic homotopy theory it is usually denoted @xmath169 .",
    "the skew - commutativity result for the motivic stable homotopy ring is the following , obtained as a direct corollary of proposition  [ pr : main1 ] :    [ pr : motivic - commute ] for @xmath170 and @xmath171 one has @xmath172    now assume that the ground field is @xmath173 , so that there is a realization map @xmath174 from the stable motivic homotopy category to the classical stable homotopy category of topological spaces .",
    "this induces a collection of group homomorphisms @xmath175 .",
    "one s first guess might be that these maps assemble into a ring homomorphism @xmath176 , but this is not quite right .",
    "instead there is the following identity :    [ pr : motivic - compare ] for @xmath170 and @xmath171 one has @xmath177",
    "this result was one of the motivations for the work in this paper ; we include the proof as a brief appendix .",
    "it is satisfying to check that propositions  [ pr : motivic - commute ] and [ pr : motivic - compare ] are ( taken together ) compatible with the graded - commutativity of the classical stable homotopy ring .",
    "this uses that @xmath178 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the group of isomorphism classes of invertible objects in @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath179 be an abelian group and let @xmath180 be a homomorphism ( the case @xmath181 is the main one of interest , but it is useful to work in slightly greater generality ) .",
    "the question we pose is whether @xmath182 can be regarded as an @xmath179-graded ring .",
    "we can certainly choose , for each @xmath183 , an object @xmath184 in the isomorphism class @xmath185 .",
    "we can then define an @xmath179-graded abelian group by @xmath186 to give a pairing on this graded group one should start by choosing isomorphisms @xmath187 , and for the pairing to be associative these isomorphisms must satisfy a certain compatibility condition ( a unital condition should also be imposed ) .",
    "our coherence results show that when @xmath179 is finitely - generated and free this can be accomplished  although it is important to realize that the method for doing so is not quite canonical , depending both on a choice of basis for @xmath179 and a choice of the @xmath130 maps we encountered earlier .",
    "what about other values of @xmath179 ?",
    "we will show that    1 .   for any abelian group @xmath179",
    ", the isomorphisms @xmath188 can be chosen so that @xmath189 is an associative and unital ring ; 2 .",
    "however , the choices involved in ( 1 ) are not canonical and the different isomorphism classes of rings one can obtain are in bijective correspondence with the elements of the group cohomology @xmath190 .    in homotopy theory",
    "one often hears the slogan `` one should grade things by the invertible objects '' ; point ( 2 ) above suggests that this is a little more dicey than one might wish .",
    "these results are in section  [ se : schema ] .      from a certain perspective",
    "this paper is entirely on the subject of getting signs correct  although the `` signs '' are not just @xmath191 but rather elements in the @xmath64-torsion of @xmath29 , where @xmath192 is a symmetric monoidal category .",
    "many of the results are undoubtedly folklore , but just lacking a convenient reference .",
    "since this is a subject where it seems particularly important to _ have _ a convenient reference  no one likes to think about signs  we have included quite a bit of exposition ( perhaps overdoing it on occasion ) .",
    "associativity and commutativity for @xmath193-graded stable homotopy rings have typically been dealt with in a somewhat different way than what we describe here .",
    "in essence , the various choices for isomorphisms are built into the framework from the very beginning , and one is tasked with keeping track of them .",
    "we refer the reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13 , section 1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 21.1 ) for detailed discussions .    certainly proposition  [ pr : main1 ] and related results are if not well - known then at least not surprising ",
    "although i wonder if the sign in the multiplicativity of the forgetful map ( see proposition  [ pr : motivic - compare ] ) has been noticed before , either in the motivic or equivariant context .",
    "i have also been unable to find a reference in the literature similar to proposition  [ pr : l - r - general ] , even though the sign questions dealt with by that result are ubiquitous .",
    "invertible objects are well - studied in the literature ( for example , in @xcite ) , but in somewhat sporadic places  and there seem to be some gaps . for a self - map @xmath55 where @xmath2 is invertible , there are two ways to obtain an element of @xmath194 .",
    "one is called the _ trace _ of @xmath195 , and the other is something that does not have a standard name  in this paper we call it the _ @xmath196-invariant_. these two invariants can be different , although they sometimes get confused .",
    "we attempt to give a careful treatment in section  [ se : inv ] .",
    "as far as the coherence statements are concerned , the earliest result along these lines seems to be ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.4.3 ) , due to deligne .",
    "however , deligne s result ( stated without proof ) only applied to symmetric monoidal categories where the self - twists @xmath197 are all equal to the identity ; as is clear from the results listed above , this omits the important and nontrivial phenomena that occur in the general case .",
    "symmetric monoidal categories in which all objects are invertible are treated again in @xcite .",
    "a classification theorem is given ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.6 ) ) , from which coherence results are easily deducible , but again only in the case where the self - twists are all equal to the identity .",
    "another sort of classification theorem for such categories is given in the unpublished phd thesis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter ii , section 2 , proposition 5 ) ; but although hong s theorem allows for non - identity self - twists the classification is of a different nature and does not seem to yield any coherence results .",
    "the excellent and influential paper @xcite has coherence results in the braided context , but not for invertible objects ; it gives a classification theorem for braided monoidal categories where all objects are invertible , but again not yielding coherence results in any evident way .",
    "the literature contains many more sophisticated coherence results than the ones presented here , and so it seems to be merely an unfortunate accident that there is no convenient reference for them .      in section  [ se : maclane ]",
    "we give a brief review of maclane s coherence theorem for monoidal categories , and explain how it gives rise to associativity results for @xmath198-graded morphism groups .",
    "section  [ se : kl ] then reviews the deeper coherence theorem of kelly - laplaza , which applies to symmetric monoidal categories with left duals .",
    "section  [ se : inv ] develops the basic theory of invertible objects , in particular establishing that the trace of the identity map on such an object has order at most two ; this is a key result used throughout the paper . in section  [",
    "se : coherence ] we prove the coherence theorems for invertible objects , and in section  [ se : app ] we give the applications to @xmath5-graded morphism rings .",

    "so it suffices to prove the proposition in the case @xmath504 and @xmath497 .",
    "let @xmath505 be the number of @xmath506 maps that appear in @xmath195 , and let @xmath507 be the number of @xmath508 maps that appear .",

    "using remark  [ re : move - around ] , the identities @xmath512 and @xmath513 show that @xmath514 .",
    "the reason for introducing @xmath331 is that it only involves maps that exist for dualizable objects , rather than invertible ones .",
    "so we may consider @xmath331 as a composite in the category kelly - laplaza category @xmath465 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath195 was acceptable implies that @xmath331 can be represented by the disjoint union of simple closed curves ; for example , one of the components might look like this :    ( 300,120 ) ( 100,0 )    let us be clear about why this works .",
    "the assumption that the formal composite @xmath195 is acceptable guarantees that the only twist maps that appear in @xmath331 come together with an @xmath28 or @xmath25 . in terms of the pictures ,",
    "each of these twists can be eliminated ; to see this , recall how the pictures work :    @xmath515&\\bullet}=\\alpha,\\qquad \\xymatrix{\\bullet \\ar@/_3ex/[r]&\\bullet}=\\hat{\\alpha},\\ ] ]    @xmath516 & \\bullet\\ar[ddl]\\\\ & & = & & & = t\\alpha,\\\\ \\bullet & \\bullet \\ar@/_3ex/[l ] &   & \\bullet & \\bullet\\ar[uul ] } \\qquad \\xymatrixrowsep{0.5pc}\\xymatrixcolsep{1.3pc } \\xymatrix { & & & \\bullet&\\bullet\\ar[ddl ] & \\\\   & & = & & & = \\hat{\\alpha}t.\\\\ \\bullet & \\bullet \\ar@/^3ex/[l ] & & \\bullet\\ar@/_3ex/[r]&\\bullet\\ar[uul]}\\ ] ]    the twists in @xmath331 only appear in conjunction with a cup or cap , and so they can all be depicted by an untwisted cup or cap going in the opposite direction .",
    "now we come to the crux of the matter . for",
    "the moment assume that the picture for @xmath331 only contains one component , for simplicity .",
    "in this simple closed curve , every @xmath28 or @xmath25 appears as a right - pointing arrow on a cup or cap .",
    "likewise , every @xmath511 or @xmath510 appears as a left - pointing arrow on a cup or cap .",
    "so the number of left - pointing arrows in our simple closed curve is @xmath517 .",
    "but elementary topology shows that in a ( nice enough ) directed , simple , closed curve the number of left - pointing critical points must always be odd ( the same is true for the number of right - pointing critical points , of course ) .",
    "so @xmath206 is odd .    in the category @xmath518",
    "we know that a simple closed curve as above is equal to @xmath471 .",
    "so when @xmath331 is evaluated in @xmath9 it also gives this trace .",
    "putting everything together , we find that @xmath519 .",
    "given that @xmath206 is odd , this just equals the identity ( using proposition  [ pr : tr - inv ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof for the case that the picture for @xmath331 has only one component .    for the multi - component case",
    "we observe that in @xmath465 the map @xmath331 is the composition of the maps represented by each individual component ; by what has already been argued , @xmath520 is a composition of identity maps and hence equal to the identity .",
    "this is essentially the same as the proof of theorem  [ th : coherence ] , except we use the kelly - laplaza category @xmath521 .",
    "note that the existence part of the theorem is obvious ; the work lies in showing uniqueness of the isomorphism .",
    "for this one reduces , just as in theorem  [ th : coherence ] , to the case of a composite @xmath195 that starts and ends with @xmath7 and is of the type specified in the statement of the theorem .",
    "the composite @xmath195 is then replaced by a corresponding formal composite @xmath331 in @xmath521 .",
    "the picture for @xmath331 is a collection of simple , closed curves in the plane , each labelled by one of the @xmath45 s , which are allowed to intersect each other in double points .",
    "the kelly - laplaza theorem identifies @xmath331 with the composite of the maps whose pictures correspond to each closed curve . in this way one reduces to the one - variable case handled by theorem  [ th : coherence ] , to conclude that @xmath195 must be the identity .",
    "the proof proceeds along the same lines as that of theorem  [ th : coherence ] .",
    "one immediately reduces to the case @xmath504 , @xmath497 , and where the parity of @xmath195 is even .",
    "just as before , we replace @xmath195 by a corresponding formal composite @xmath331 in the kelly - laplaza category @xmath465 .",
    "we have @xmath522 where the integer @xmath206 is the same as in the proof of theorem  [ th : coherence ] .",
    "the picture corresponding to @xmath331 is no longer a union of simple curves as it was in the proof of theorem  [ th : coherence ] .",
    "rather , it is a union of oriented , closed curves that may contain double points of self - intersection . for pedagogical purposes",
    "let us first deal with the case where the picture contains a single closed curve , for example as follows :    ( 300,120 ) ( 100,10 )    it is easy to prove that in such an oriented curve one has    [ eq : critical ] ( ) + ( ) 1  .",
    "indeed , let @xmath523 denote the number on the left of the congruence .",
    "imagine taking a closed loop of string  an unknot  and laying it on top of the plane containing our oriented curve , in such a way that the string exactly covers the curve .",
    "this gives us an oriented knot diagram which is similar to our original picture but in which every double - point has been changed to an over- or under - crossing .",
    "one readily checks that the parity of the number @xmath523 is unchanged under the reidemeister moves .",
    "since our knot diagram is equivalent to the unknot , this says that the parity of @xmath523 is the same as the corresponding number for an oriented circle .",
    "but a circle clearly gives @xmath524 .",
    "the number of left - pointing critical points in the picture for @xmath331 is just the number @xmath206 .",
    "likewise , the number of double points in the picture is the parity of the formal composite @xmath195 , which we have assumed to be even .",
    "so ( [ eq : critical ] ) tells us that @xmath206 is odd .",
    "the kelly - laplaza theorem implies that @xmath525 .",
    "so @xmath526 .",
    "since @xmath527 is even @xmath528 by proposition  [ pr : tr - inv ] , and this completes the proof in the present case ( where the picture for @xmath331 contains one closed curve ) .    for the general case we have @xmath529 where @xmath530 is the number of closed curves in the picture .",
    "the analog of ( [ eq : critical])whose proof is the same as before  becomes    [ eq : critical2 ] ( ) + ( ) e .",
    "we then obtain @xmath531 , and ( [ eq : critical2 ] ) yields that @xmath532 is even .",
    "so again we have @xmath533 , as desired .",
    "this is a straightforward generalization of the proof of theorem  [ th : coherence2 ] , in the same way that theorem  [ th : multi - coherence1 ] generalized theorem  [ th : coherence ] .",
    "the main point is that a map from @xmath7 to @xmath7 in @xmath521 is represented by a collection of closed curves , each of which is labelled by one of the @xmath45 s .",
    "the kelly - laplaza theorem identifies such a map with the composite of the maps obtained by considering each closed curve separately .",
    "the @xmath113-parity of our formal composite represents the number of double points in the curves labelled by @xmath45 .",
