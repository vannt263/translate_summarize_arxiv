    "heavy - fermion ( hf ) systems are materials with large charge carrier masses , exceeding those of free electrons by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "this results in a highly enhanced sommerfeld coefficient @xmath0 at low temperatures  @xcite and huge effective masses in quantum oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "the observation of superconductivity in cecu@xmath1si@xmath1 with a huge anomaly in the low - temperature specific heat directly demonstrated the itinerant character of heavy fermionic quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of these materials at low temperatures are dominated by f electrons and their antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange @xmath2 with conduction electrons .",
    "similar as for diluted moments in a metallic environment , the kondo interaction leads to a screening of the local moments by conduction electrons .",
    "however , in dense kondo lattices , the indirect exchange coupling between the moments , by a spin polarization of the conduction electrons , can mediate long - range magnetic ordering .",
    "this rkky interaction grows quadratically with @xmath2 , while the kondo interaction increases exponentially with @xmath2 .",
    "the competition between these two interactions is illustrated in the `` doniach diagram '' , shown in the left part of fig .",
    "1 . for small @xmath2 , magnetic ordering is found , while beyond a critical @xmath3 , the ground state changes to paramagnetic .",
    "hf behavior is found in the regime where the two competing interactions are of similar strength . in the last decades numerous examples for magnetically ordered , superconducting or just paramagnetic hf metals have been synthesized and investigated  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as suggested by doniach  @xcite , hf metals are extremely sensitive to small changes of pressure , which e.g. for ce - based hf metals enhances @xmath2 and suppresses magnetic ordering .",
    "this pressure sensitivity is reflected in highly enhanced values of the grneisen parameter , which we introduce in the following .",
    "we start by considering the volume thermal expansion coefficient @xmath4 i.e. , the relative volume change with temperature at constant pressure . using maxwell s relation",
    "it is proportional to the pressure dependence of the entropy @xmath5 . if entropy has different contributions from e.g. phonons , electrons or magnons , the same holds true for specific heat at constant pressure @xmath6 and thermal expansion .",
    "typically each contribution to entropy can be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the respective dominating energy scale .",
    "this is the debye temperature for acoustic phonons , the fermi energy for a metal or the magnon bandwidth for a magnet .",
    "it is then convenient to define grneisen parameters @xmath9 with the molar volume @xmath10 and isothermal compressibility @xmath11 . inserting the scaling ansatz for the entropy yields @xmath12 indicating that the grneisen parameters are temperature independent , as found more than 100 years ago by grneisen  @xcite , and that they quantify the relative pressure dependences of the respective energy scales . for phonons in insulators or electrons in simple metals , typically values of order 1 are observed . in the experiment , various contributions to heat capacity and thermal expansion add up and it may be difficult to extract them separately . in this case",
    ", one can analyze the `` effective grneisen parameter ''  @xcite @xmath13 which is the sum of the grneisen parameters from the various contributions times their relative fraction to the total heat capacity .",
    "hf metals display a largely enhanced effective grneisen parameter ( cf .",
    "right part of fig .",
    "1 ) , reflecting that a small volume change has huge influences on these materials  @xcite .",
    "this is because their dominating energy scale , called , kondo temperature @xmath14 , is of order 1 - 100  k , which is much lower than the fermi temperature of metals , and highly pressure dependent .    motivated by the theoretical prediction of a divergent grneisen parameter near quantum critical points by zhu , garst , rosch and si in 2003  @xcite , more thorough experimental investigations to temperatures below 4 k",
    "were performed  @xcite .",
    "below 4  k the f - electron contribution to heat capacity and thermal expansion largely exceeds the contribution of phonons .",
    "thus , the measured grneisen data presented here arise from electronic degrees of freedom and the suffix `` effective '' can be omitted since phonons play hardly any role here .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce quantum criticality and discuss its generic signatures in measurements of the grneisen parameters . after discussing qcp scenarios ( section 3 ) ,",
    "we first provide a few examples for quantum critical behavior in accordance with the expectations of the hertz - millis theory for itinerant quantum criticality ( section 4 ) .",
    "section 5 ( beyond hertz - millis ) introduces results which are at odds with those predictions and hint at new forms of qcps .",

    "the correlation time @xmath21 diverges in the approach of the critical temperature @xmath22 one obtains @xmath23 within the scaling regime close to the phase transition .",
    "consequently temporal order - parameter fluctuations do not play a role for classical criticality .",
    "however , @xmath24 for a qcp . therefore the above inequality is violated in the critical regime associated with a qcp . in the quantum critical regime",
    "the free energy can not be expressed by a function @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , as for classical criticality .",
    "it is rather temperature itself , which determines the growth of order parameter fluctuations when the qcp is approached . in the regime above the qcp ,",
    "the energy of order parameter fluctuations is just given by @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the ( constant ) dominating energy scale @xmath8 in equation ( 2 ) has to be replaced by temperature and thus a divergence of the grneisen parameter upon cooling in the quantum critical regime ( cf . the red area in fig .",

    "the correlation time @xmath32 is related to the correlation length by the dynamical critical exponent @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "hyperscaling of the free energy reveals , that the ratio of the critical contributions to thermal expansion and heat capacity , called critical grneisen ratio , diverges as @xmath34 in the quantum critical regime above the qcp  @xcite . furthermore , within the quantum critical regime , the grneisen ratio changes its sign upon tuning the control parameter  @xcite .",

    "the black lines in fig .",
    "2a ) show a minimum when crossing the quantum critical regime by tuning the control parameter @xmath16 .",
    "since the grneisen ratio @xmath35 measures the normalized slope of these traces , the entropy accumulation generically results in a sign - change of @xmath36 within the quantum critical regime .",
    "thus , there are two important characteristics of qcps : the grneisen ratio diverges and changes its sign as function of the control parameter . the absence of an analytical grneisen ratio divergence has proven smeared qpts instead of generic qcps for nearly ferromagnetic metals",

    "such experiments can be realized using capacitive dilatometers  @xcite and micro - calorimeters  @xcite .",
    "in addition the linear thermal expansion can reveal important information on anisotropic behavior and lattice symmetry breaking transitions  @xcite .    in many cases ,",
    "qcps can be tuned by magnetic fields .",
    "it is therefore best to study the `` magnetic '' grneisen parameter which is thermodynamically given by the ratio of the negative temperature derivative of the magnetization ( which equals the field derivative of the entropy ) to the heat capacity : @xmath39 interestingly , this property equals the adiabatic magnetocaloric ( mce ) effect .",
    "in contrast to the ordinary grneisen parameter , the magnetic grneisen parameter can be measured directly by determining the temperature change induced by a field change under adiabatic conditions .",
    "high - precision measurements of the adiabatic mce down to very low temperatures have been realized utilizing an alternating magnetic field method .",

    "the global phase diagram ( fig . 3a ) suggests new kinds of quantum phase transitions for geometrically frustrated kondo latices  @xcite .",
    "since strong frustration opposes kondo singlet formation , a locally critical qcp and even a metallic spin liquid state with local moments is expected for highly frustrated materials .",
    "we therefore now turn our attention to quantum criticality in hf systems such as cepdal  @xcite , ybagge  @xcite and cerhsn  @xcite that crystallize in the hexagonal zrnial structure . in these materials ,",

    "3a neither explicitly treats magnetic field as tuning parameter nor considers the possibility of a metamagnetic ( spin flop ) transition in the af@xmath49 regime . as sketched in fig .",
    "9d , a bicritical point as found in ybagge arises naturally between different af@xmath49 states with local moments as function of field .",
    "geometrical frustration , which enhances the degree of quantum fluctuations , is efficient in depressing @xmath107 to absolute zero .",
    "although ybagge does not exactly realize such a quantum bcp , @xmath107 is low enough to lead to pronounced quantum bicritical fluctuations , which dominate the physical properties of this material over large areas in phase space ( cf .",

    "this is _ quantum _ in contrast to classical scaling , which would have required a finite critical temperature .",
    "a characteristic feature of such quantum bicriticality is the observed asymmetry of the grneisen ratio for fields below and above the critical field ( inset fig .",

    "we now turn to quantum critical behavior in isostructural cerhsn . despite a large single ion kondo scale of order 100  k",
    "which would indicate a tendency towards valence fluctuating behavior , the magnetic susceptibility is highly anisotropic and does not saturate upon cooling to low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the absence of long - range order has been confirmed down to 50 mk by @xmath110sr  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "9a , the heat capacity coefficient displays an unusual increase below 0.5  k , which is suppressed by the application of a moderate magnetic field .",
    "indeed the grneisen ratio of ( volume ) thermal expansion to specific heat , as well as the magnetic grneisen ratio at low fields both display a power - law divergence indicating a zero - field qcp  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the linear thermal expansion coefficient displays a pronounced anisotropy at low temperatures . while anisotropic thermal expansion behavior in general is not uncommon for non - cubic materials , it is unique to find nfl behavior along one direction ( cf . the divergence of @xmath111 in fig .",
    "9b ) and ordinary fl behavior along another ( here along the c - axis ) .",
    "generally , thermal expansion is given by the sum of a background and a singular nfl contribution .",
    "both are determined by the uniaxial pressure dependences of the respective entropy contributions .",
    "thus , the striking anisotropy indicates that the quantum critical contribution to entropy has little c - axis pressure dependence . as sketched in fig .",
    "9b , this is expected for criticality arising from geometrical frustration , which is unaffected by c - axis pressure  @xcite . in the 3d phase diagram ( fig .",
    "9d ) , this places cerhsn at a zero - field qcp which is driven by strong quantum fluctuations due to geometrical frustration .",
    "therefore some reminiscence of local - moment metamagnetism is expected .",
    "while the magnetic grneisen ratio for fields along the c - axis monotonically decreases with increasing field , it shows a characteristic zero crossing near 3.5 t for the field along the a axis  ( fig .",
    "9c )  @xcite . along this direction",
    "the low - field low-@xmath42 magnetic susceptibility is about 30 times smaller compared to the respective data along the c - direction .",
    "such behavior is different to itinerant metamagnetism , which is most pronounced along the direction with larger susceptibility .",
    "rather it resembles local - moment metamagnetism .",
    "however , in contrast to ordinary spin - flop transitions , metamagnetism in cerhsn does not occur as a first - order transition .",
    "related to the fact that there are no ordered phases at the low- and high - field sides of the critical field , there is no first - order transition but only a weak crossover .",
    "this behavior could be ascribed to the strong geometrical frustration which suppresses long - range ordering .",
    "furthermore , the involved moments are tiny as evidenced by the small entropy contribution of order @xmath112 .",
    "kondo screening and quantum fluctuations are held responsible for the smallness of the moments .",
    "altogether the thermodynamic properties suggest a novel type of qcp and metallic spin liquid state in cerhsn  @xcite .",

    "as discussed in chapter 2 , a field - induced qcp generically results in a divergence and sign change of the magnetic grneisen ratio @xmath117 . for illustration ,",
    "10 displays data for insulating copper - nitrate ( cn ) , which is a well known dimerized 1d quantum magnet  @xcite . in cn",
    "an applied magnetic field induces spin - flop ordering between two critical fields , leading to two field induced qcps . from the measured magnetic grneisen ratio the adiabatic temperature traces",
    "are obtained by integration ( cf .",
    "white lines in fig .",
    "they indicate a drastic cooling in the vicinity of the two qcps , which has been known experimentally and modeled theoretically since several decades  @xcite .",
    "more recently it was recognized that compared to the adiabatic cooling with paramagnetic salts , cooling using quantum critical matter could have significant advantages  @xcite .",
    "the latter allows in principle a much higher density of magnetic ions compared to paramagnetic salts which need to be very diluted for reducing their ordering to very low @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the cooling power per unit - cell volume for quantum critical systems could be considerably larger .",
    "quantum critical materials , due to the abundance of low - energy excitations , could be cooled in principle to arbitrarily small minimal temperatures , keeping the cooling power large  @xcite . by contrast , cooling with diluted paramagnetic salts is limited by the residual interaction of the moments .",
    "their heat capacity shows a narrow schottky type anomaly and highly efficient cooling is only reached in the temperature interval around the specific heat maximum .",
    "quantum critical systems display an excitation spectrum very different compared to simple paramagnets . within the quantum critical regime ,",
    "the specific heat coefficient often follows a logarithmic temperature dependence or weak power law .",
    "thus , on raising the temperature the specific heat coefficient decreases far more gently compared to the schottky - type behaviour @xmath118 for paramagnets .",
    "this leads to much longer hold times at elevated temperatures compared to paramagnets  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the efficiency , defined by the ratio of heat expelled at the high temperature stage in an adiabatic magnetization refrigerator in comparison to the heat removed during cooling , is significantly larger for quantum critical materials than for paramagnetic salts  @xcite .    compared to magnetic insulators ,",
    "hf metals have a huge thermal conductivity at low temperatures , which makes applications at very low temperatures significantly easier .",
    "however , in the regime close to the qcp typically only a very small amount of the entropy is involved in these materials due to the onset of kondo screening as the temperature is lowered below @xmath119 . for ge - doped ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1 with @xmath120",
    "k , for example , only about 10% ( 2% ) of @xmath121 is available below 1  k ( 0.1  k )  @xcite , which is too small for practical applications .",
    "ideal for involving a significant amount of entropy in the cooling process would be a hf metal with small @xmath119 , being located close to a qcp at very low magnetic fields .",
    "such constraints are very hard to fulfill , since kondo lattices with low @xmath122  k typically display stable long range magnetic ordering with a large critical field of order 10  t or more .",
    "cubic ybco@xmath1zn@xmath123 may be a promising candidate system , since it exhibits among all known paramagnetic hf metals the lowest kondo temperature of only @xmath124  k  @xcite .",
    "its unique behaviour is related to its crystal structure which consists of zn cages surrounding the yb atoms .",
    "these cages lead to a very weak hybridization between the yb 4f and co 3d electrons .",
    "this effectively reduces @xmath2 , which enters both @xmath119 and @xmath125 .",
    "consequently , ybco@xmath1zn@xmath123 has an extremely large sommerfeld coefficient , @xmath126   j / mol k@xmath127  @xcite . due to the small kondo scale",
    "the hf state in this material can be effectively suppressed by fields of order several tesla .",
    "ybco@xmath1zn@xmath123 can be driven towards a qcp by suitable doping and is a promising candidate for adiabatic cooling applications  @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of hf metals based upon partially filled 4f or 5f shells are governed by the interplay of the on - site kondo and the long - range rkky exchange interaction .",
    "generically , they have a low - lying characteristic temperature , called kondo temperature , which is highly sensitive to changes of the f - conduction electron exchange .",
    "this gives rise to a strong pressure sensitivity of the kondo temperature and relatedly a highly enhanced grneisen parameter .",
    "similar as the enhanced sommerfeld coefficient this is an important experimental indication of hf behavior .",
    "furthermore , the grneisen ratio of thermal expansion to specific heat and respectively the magnetic grneisen parameter or adiabatic mce are sensitive probes of qcps . they have been used to characterize such instabilities in various material classes .",
    "examples include insulating low - dimensional quantum spin chains  @xcite , itinerant ferromagnets  @xcite or iron - pnictides  @xcite .    in this review ,",
    "we have concentrated on hf metals .",
    "the stronger than logarithmic divergence of the grneisen ratio upon cooling in the quantum critical regime is a clear - cut criterion for the simple experimental identification of qcps .",
    "it allows to distinguish smeared quantum phase transitions from generic qcps .",
    "furthermore a scaling analysis of the grneisen ratio provides important information on the nature of the underlying critical fluctuations .",
    "we have categorized different materials by studies of the grneisen parameter divergence . while one class shows criticality in accordance with the generic hertz - millis theory we have presented other examples , for which more advanced scenarios are currently discussed .",
    "possibly the divergence of the magnetic grneisen parameter can be used for cooling applications at mk temperatures .",
    "the analysis of quantum critical behavior in the thermal expansion and the grneisen ratio discussed in this article assumes a weak perturbation of criticality by the lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that the latter do not modify the critical behavior .",
    "while this assumption is justified in many cases it breaks down for a bilinear coupling between the strain tensor and the order parameter , which is allowed at end points of lines of first - order metamagnetic or mott transitions and at electronic nematic transitions  @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior is then governed by critical crystal elasticity , which can lead to dramatic effects such as the breakdown of hooke s law or vanishing sound velocities  @xcite . up to now , there are no systematic investigations of the sound velocity and the elastic constants near qcps , probably due the requirement of large single crystalline samples , which are not available for many cases .",
    "very recently , a qcp in the series ( ca@xmath37sr@xmath38)@xmath68rh@xmath128sn@xmath129 , related to a second - order structural instability , has been found  @xcite . remarkably , the phonon heat capacity contribution is enhanced by almost a factor five near the qcp , indicating strong phonon softening .",
    "it should be interesting to investigate the signature of such a structural qcp using the grneisen parameter .",
