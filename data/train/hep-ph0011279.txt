    "there have been several studies which explore the possible existence of cosmic birefringence @xcite . in recent work kar",
    "et al @xcite and majumdar and sengupta @xcite has pointed out that the kalb - ramond field , which arises in supergravity theories , makes the space time birefringent .",
    "the authors solve the electromagnetic wave equations in the presence of such a field and predict that this field will lead to a redshift dependent rotation of polarization whose details depend on whether the universe is radiation or matter dominated .",
    "earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite carroll et al analyzed the polarizations of radio waves from distance galaxies and quasars as a function of redshifts and found no statistically significant effect .",
    "the observable of interest in that study was the angle @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the orientation angle of the axis of the radio galaxy and @xmath2 the observed polarization angle after the effect of faraday rotation is taken out of the data .",
    "this can be done by making a straight line fit to the polarization angle @xmath3 which can be expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wavelength , @xmath6 and @xmath2 are the slope and the intercept of the fit .",
    "@xmath6 stands for rotation measure and depends on the plasma density and the parallel component of the background magnetic field along the direction of propagation of the wave .",
    "later ref .",
    "@xcite claimed the existence of a large scale anisotropy in the same data .",
    "this claim was , however , questioned by many authors @xcite .",
    "the possibility of local anisotropy , independent of redshift , was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite and earlier in @xcite .",
    "these authors found a statistically significant effect .",
    "the original claim made by birch @xcite in 1982 was dismissed by bietenholz and kronberg @xcite in 1984 who compiled a larger data set which they claimed did not show any effect .",
    "however jain and ralston @xcite argued that ref .",
    "@xcite did not pay careful attention to the parity of the correlation ansatz @xcite .",
    "when the transformation properties of statistical distribution are taken into account the data does show a significant effect which is further enhanced by choosing an appropriate statistic as well as by putting some cuts on the data .",
    "inspite of the progress in our understanding in string theory in the last two decades , we are yet to have a string theory prediction that can be tested in the experiments .",
    "one of the main reason for such an unsatisfactory situation is that the energy scale at which stringy effects become significant is beyond the reach of present day experiments .",
    "it is thus believed that the most likely area for a confrontation between string theory and experiments is through extracting astrophysical or cosmological consequences of string theory which might be measurable today . with this kind of motivation in mind",
    ", we study in this paper the prediction of string theory for cosmic birefringence .",
    "however , as our knowledge of string theory is mostly perturbative in nature , we face several problems in carrying out such a study .",
    "these are mainly due to the presence of various massless moduli that are present in the low energy limit of string theory .",
    "we will point those out as we proceed .",
    "four dimensional heterotic string theory , in its low energy limit , contains moduli coming from compactification , gauge fields , dilaton and an axion . in this theory ,",
    "coupling among various fields are unique and they are all controlled by the expectation value of dilaton .",
    "given such a framework , we analyse the propagation of electromagnetic waves in curved metric background . due to the presence of dilaton ,",
    "as we will argue , medium turns into a conducting medium where the time variation of dilaton plays the role of effective conductivity . on the other hand",
    ", the axion rotates the plane of polarization of the electromagnetic wave causing non - trivial birefringence .",
    "however , notice that the dilaton ( and other moduli ) is a massless scalar in string theory .",
    "an important issue to resolve in string cosmology is to explain the absence of massless dilaton at the present time .",
    "one expects that a potential for dilaton will be generated in string theory through some non - perturbative effects and the dilaton will sit at the minimum of the potential picking up a mass .",
    "the mechanism of how precisely this should happen is still unknown in string theory .",
    "this , in turn , creates the most severe problem in comparing observational data with string theory . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we continue to treat dilaton as a massless scalar and find string prediction for cosmic birefringence .",
    "we hope that some of our results will be helpful when dilaton decoupling in string theory is properly understood . in general , we find that the relevant equations are hard to solve exactly .",
    "however , it is well - known that heterotic string theory in four dimensions is self dual .",
    "the duality group is parametrized by @xmath7 matrices . using this property , in the next section",
    ", we generate some non - trivial solutions for various fields starting from some simple seed configuration .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to calculate birefringence of electromagnetic waves , propagating in radiation or matter dominated universe , in a fairly straightforward manner .",
    "however , since the solution generating technique does not saturate all possible allowed configurations , in section iii , we solve the electromagnetic equations within the wkb approximation .",
    "we then discuss our results in section iv .",
    "in the low energy limit , the heterotic string compactified on six - torus is represented by the following action @xcite : @xmath8 \\label{het}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the gauge fields and the anti - symmetric three rank tensor field are defined as @xmath9 the superscript @xmath10 on @xmath11 runs from @xmath12 to @xmath13 denoting the @xmath13 gauge fields that appear in the four dimensional heterotic string action . out of these @xmath13 gauge fields ,",
    "@xmath14 are originally present in ten dimensions .",
    "the rest @xmath15 appear due to torus compactification . among other terms in ( [ het ] ) , @xmath16 is the scalar curvature associated with the metric @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the dilaton .",
    "the @xmath19 dimensional matrix @xmath20 encodes all the scalars that appear due to compactification . ) , the first two terms in the action is like brans - dicke ( bd ) theory with the bd parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the radar - echo delay experiments @xcite in solar system have set the limit on @xmath22 .",
    "so in a sense , the theory as it stands is ruled out by this experiment . however , let us note that the string action in general has many moduli field ( such as matrix @xmath20 here ) .",
    "if these scalars happen to have flat direction along the dilaton , the effective @xmath23 might change from its value @xmath24 . ] in what follows , the detail of their structure will not be important .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 in ( [ het ] ) is also @xmath19 dimensional and is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes @xmath28 identity matrix .    in the following ,",
    "however , we will work with a truncated version of the effective action .",
    "we will turn off all the scalars that appear due to compactification .",
    "this essentially amounts to setting the matrix @xmath20 to identity .",
    "furthermore , we will set all the gauge fields to zero except one .",
    "we will take this one to be present in the original ten dimensional heterotic action .",
    "we will see that this choice of trunctation makes the dynamics tractable and at the same time keeps the essential physics intact . in this approximation",
    ", the action , in the einstein frame , reduces to @xmath29 \\label{einhet}\\ ] ] the equation of motion for the @xmath30 following from the above action is @xmath31 this , in turn , allows us to introduce a pseudoscalar field @xmath32 , known as axion , through the relation @xmath33 with this definition of @xmath32 , the rest of the equations of motion are the following @xmath34 here @xmath35 which satisfies bianchi identity @xmath36    it is easy to check that the set of equations ( [ curv])-([phieq ] ) and ( [ bianc ] ) are invariant under the following set of @xmath37 transformations @xcite    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are real parameters with @xmath41 .    here , in what follows , we will restrict ourselves to the case where dilaton , axion and the metric are only function of time .",
    "our startegy will be to solve all the equations of motion in a _ fixed _ metric background .",
    "first , we take the metric as @xmath42 the gauge field strength @xmath11 in this background can be defined as @xcite @xmath43 with this definition , equation ( [ gfield ] ) reduces to @xmath44 similarly the scalar equations are @xmath45 on the otherhand , ( [ bianc ] ) reduces to @xmath46      before we go on to analyse more realistic scenario , it is worthwile to study ( [ one ] ) - ( [ three ] ) in _ flat _ metric background for which @xmath47 . beside being completely tractable , this will indeed give us an idea of dilatonic and axionic influence on the propagation of electromagnetic waves .",
    "in this very special context , equations ( [ one])-([three ] ) reduce to the following forms : @xmath48 it is easy to check that when @xmath18 is turned of , the above equations reduce to the case analyzed in @xcite",
    ". the very presence of dilaton @xmath18 effects the dynamics in a very crucial way . in order to understand the behaviour of the solutions",
    ", we first set the axion field @xmath32 to zero .",
    "then equation ( [ six ] ) reduces to @xmath49 such an equation for magnetic field is quite well known from the studies of electromagnetic wave propagation in conducting medium . as we can see from ( [ magfield ] ) ,",
    "the time variation of dilaton plays the role of effective conductivity of the medium .",
    "such a damping factor , as usual , reduces the amplitude of the magnetic field @xmath50 .",
    "the set of equations ( [ three])-([six ] ) are in general very hard to solve directly .",
    "though it would be desirable to have such solutions , we would however use the property ( [ dtrans ] ) of heterotic string theory to generate new solutions from some simple ones . to this end",
    ", we notice that if we set the dilaton field to zero ( using sift symmetry of dilaton in heterotic string theory , we can always bring any constant dilaton field to zero ) , equations ( [ three])-([six ] ) possess a set of solutions @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an integration constant and @xmath53 . in the above equations , we have defined @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the direction of propagation .",
    "furthermore @xmath56 are defined as the circular polarization states , namely @xmath57 .",
    "now writing @xmath58 and birefringence as @xmath59 , we get @xcite @xmath60 here , for flat metric , @xmath61 is same as cosmic time @xmath62 .",
    "thus in the above equation , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the earlier and present time .    as discussed earlier in ( [ dtrans ] ) , heterotic string theory in four dimension has self - duality symmetry . as a consequence , equations of motion for various fields",
    "are invariant under @xmath7 transformation .",
    "these transformations have the property to generate non - trivial field configurations from the known ones . a generic solution is thus parametrized by three independent parameters of @xmath7 group . here , we start with the field configuration given in ( [ seed ] ) where dilaton field is set to zero .",
    "next , by the use of @xmath7 symmetry , we generate configurations with nontrivial dilaton and various other fields . strictly following the transformation rules given in ( [ dtrans ] ) , and denoting the new configurations by @xmath65 , we , thus , get @xmath66 where @xmath32 is given in ( [ seed ] ) .",
    "as expected the solutions are parametrized by three independent @xmath67 parameters ( taken here as ) @xmath68 .",
    "the other parameter @xmath10 is determined from the relation @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , from the transformation property of @xmath11 under @xmath7 , we get @xmath69b_\\pm e^{ikz } e^{i\\omega_\\pm t }   \\nonumber\\\\ & & { e}_\\pm^\\prime = \\pm{i\\omega_\\pm \\over k}[(c \\psi + d ) \\mp",

    "~{\\rm for}~k > > h.\\ ] ]      here , we will study ( [ gfield])-([bianc ] ) for the general metric given in ( [ met ] ) .",
    "we will follow the same strategy as the previous subsection in order to find solutions of equations of motion . keeping this in mind ,",
    "let us first consider ( [ gfield])-([bianc ] ) when the dilaton is set to zero .",
    "in that case , defining @xmath71 , we get an equation for magnetic field as follows @xcite : @xmath72 with @xmath52 being a constant .",
    "if @xmath73 increases fast enough with @xmath61 ( which is indeed the case for radiation and matter dominated universe ) , a wkb type analysis will give us a very close to exact result for the above equation .",
    "carrying out such a computation we get @xmath74 }   = f_\\pm e^{i k \\eta } e^{i k z } e^{i s_{\\pm}},\\ ] ] where we have @xmath75 .",
    "like @xmath76 as in eqn.(24 ) , one can also rewrite the eqn.(30 ) in the following way ,    @xmath77    where , @xmath78 .",
    "+ now we have , @xmath79 from the above experssions for @xmath80 , we see that the birefringence due to the presence of axion ( dilaton is set to zero ) is given by , @xmath81 where we have converted the conformal time @xmath82 into cosmic time @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the earlier time and present time respectively .    as before , starting from ( [ xyz ] ) and ( [ bpm ] ) and using the freedom of @xmath7 symmetry of equations of motion , we generate here large class of configurations , where axion and dilaton are given by @xmath83 where @xmath32 is given in ( [ xyz ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , from the transformation property of @xmath84 under @xmath7 , we get @xmath85 b_{\\pm}. \\label{bbb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , the expression of birefringence is given by @xmath86 +   \\int_{\\eta_1}^{\\eta_2 } \\frac{h d\\eta}{r^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after having @xmath87 for general metric , let us concentrate on two particularly interesting cases ; first radiation dominated case and then matter dominated case .",
    "radiation dominated universe * : for radiation dominated universe , @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a dimensionful constant .",
    "instead of writing various fields explicitly in this particular case , we give the expression of birefringence that follows from ( [ bbb ] ) .",
    "it is given by : and @xmath55 can be described as follows , @xmath91 where for radiation dominated phase @xmath92 and for matter dominated phase @xmath93 @xmath94 -   \\frac{h}{r_{0r}^3 t_2}\\left[1 - ( 1 + z)^{2}\\right]\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    * b2 .",
    "matter dominated universe * : for matter dominated phase , @xmath88 is given by @xmath95 . in the same way as before",
    ", one can show that the birefringence is now given by : @xmath96 -   \\frac{h}{r_{0m}^3 t_2}\\left[1 - ( 1 + z)^{3/2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , in both cases , the second term corresponds to the birefringence corresponding to zero dilaton field @xmath18 .",
    "however , in both the cases , we see that the expression of @xmath97 depends on redshift @xmath55 in a crucial way .",
    "furthermore , though very weak , @xmath97 has a dependence on the frequency @xmath98 of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "so far we have concentrated on solving the equations by first setting the dilaton field equal to zero and then using the @xmath7 transformation to generate solutions with nonzero dilaton field .",
    "however this procedure does not guarantee that all possible solutions to the equations are generated .",
    "we next solve the field equations directly within the wkb approximation .",
    "we first write the electromagnetic field equation in terms of the variable @xmath99 . since @xmath99 is assumed to be a slowly varying function we drop its second derivatives and terms proportional to @xmath100 ^ 2 $ ] . with these approximations",
    "the field equations reduce to @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the real and imaginary parts of the function @xmath99 .",
    "we also drop the term proportional to @xmath104 in the dilaton field equation ( [ dilaton_eqn ] ) since it is higher order in @xmath52 and hence expected to give negligible contribution .",
    "we then find that eq .",
    "[ dilaton_eqn ] can be solved to give @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are constants .",
    "furthermore , @xmath102 are given by , @xmath108 \\label{approximate}\\ ] ] the rotation in polarization is given by @xmath109 .",
    "the functional form of the rotation angle is plotted in fig . 1 as a function of redshift for some arbitrary choice of the parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "hence we find that the dilaton field leads to a nontrivial change in the redshift dependence of the rotation in polarization .",
    "whereas in the absence of dilaton we predict a steady increase of the polarization rotation angle with redshift , in the present case the rotation turns on only at large redshifts .",
    "we next consider the polarization data from distant quasars and radio galaxies in order to determine if there exists a signal of the type predicted by our analysis .",
    "we considered all the sources that were used in the statistical analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite for which the information about redshift was available .",
    "the nasa extragalactic data base ( ned ) was used to update the information about redshifts .",
    "we compiled a total of 231 sources in this manner ] .",
    "we also examined the data after removing all sources which lie within @xmath112 of the galactic plane .",
    "this cut is useful since it removes many sources with very large rotation measures and hence reduces the possibility of bias in data .",
    "the bias in rotation measure can arise due to the @xmath113 ambiquity in the measurement of linear polarization . after imposing this cut on the data",
    "we are left with a total of 160 sources .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood analysis in order to determine the presence of correlation in data . for the null hypothesis we use the von mises ( vm ) distribution which serves as a prototype for the statistical fluctuations for circular data .",
    "it is given by @xcite , @xmath114 \\over \\pi i_0(\\kappa ) } \\label{von}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is a parameter which measures the concentration of the population , @xmath116 is the angle between the axis of the radio galaxy and the observed polarization after taking out the effect of faraday rotation and @xmath117 is the mean angle .",
    "the factor 2 has been inserted since the polarization angle is ambiguous by @xmath113 and not @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the distribution peaks very close to @xmath119 and therefore it is reasonable to eliminate this parameter by setting it exactly equal to @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "we are therefore left with only one free parameter and the fit to the entire data set leads to @xmath121 and after the galactic cut we find @xmath122 .",
    "[ t , b ]    we next study the redshift , @xmath55 , dependence of distribution .",
    "it turns out that the distribution has a strong dependence on the redshift which can be modelled by the following generalization of the vm distribution , @xmath123 } \\label{von_z}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is a normalization factor .",
    "maximizing the likelihood in this case gives @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the maximum likelihood increases by 7 units , i.e. @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the maximum likelihoods for the distributions given in equations ( [ von ] ) and ( [ von_z ] ) respectively . after making the galactic cut",
    "the corresponding parameters are @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the statistic @xmath133 is distributed as @xmath134 .",
    "the increase in the maximum likelihood is quite large and implies that the width of the distribution has significant dependence on the redshift .",
    "this is also apparent from a plot of the distribution of the angle @xmath135 shown in fig .",
    "[ redshift ] for the complete data set and after imposing the cut on redshift , @xmath136 .",
    "we find that after imposing the cut the distribution is more strongly peaked at @xmath137 .    in order to search for a correlation of the type implied by eq .",
    "[ approximate ] we propose the following distribution @xmath138 } \\label{corr}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is a normalization factor and @xmath140 is given by @xmath141\\ ] ] this form of the distribution will lead to the relationship ( [ approximate ] ) for the polarization angle @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denotes the mean value , as long as deviation of @xmath144 from @xmath120 is small .",
    "the best fit parameters for the correlated ansatz are @xmath145 with the statistic @xmath146 for the full data set and @xmath147 with the statistic @xmath148 for the case of galactic cut . here",
    "@xmath149 is the maximum likelihood for the distribution given in equation ( [ corr ] ) .",
    "the corresponding percentage values ( p - values ) for these two cases , with and without the galactic cut , are 7% and 3.5% respectively .",
    "these p - values represent the probabilities that the correlation seen in data can be obtained from a statistical fluctuation . after making the galactic cut",
    "the results correspond to a @xmath150 effect .",
    "hence these results show marginal statistical significance .",
    "although they show a significant correlation it is clear from the best fit parameters that the solution prefers the extreme values of the parameter @xmath151 very close to zero .",
    "this implies that the deviation of @xmath116 from @xmath120 is very close to zero for a wide range of redshifts and deviates from zero only for relatively large redshifts .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "3 where we plot the data and our best fit model for the case of galactic cut . on the y - axis",
    "we plot the @xmath152 in order to deal with quantities invariant under angular coordinate transformations .",
    "the data , @xmath152 , has been averaged over the redshift interval of 0.25 in order to reduce the noise .",
    "the number of data points in each bin , starting from the smallest redshift , are 54,19,15,13,10,9,9,11,7,4,3,2,2,1,1 respectively .",
    "if we eliminate the two largest redshift points then we do not see any significant effect .",
    "strictly speaking we were unable to find the maxima of the likelihood .",
    "the fit was driven to ridicuously large values of @xmath153 and we did not search beyond these extreme values . the statistic @xmath133 in this case was roughly @xmath154 which has p - values of 45% and hence shows no significant correlation . in fig .",
    "4 we show the limits of the parameters @xmath151 and @xmath155 that are imposed by the polarization data .",
    "the limits are obtained by excluding all sources which lie within @xmath112 from the galactic plane .",
    "however the results remain unchanged even if this cut is not imposed .",
    "in this paper , we have studied cosmic birefringence in the framework of perturbative four - dimensional heterotic string theory . due to coupling between dilaton and axion in this theory",
    ", we have shown that the dilaton field changes the birefringence produced by the axion field in a nontrivial way .",
    "we obtained an approximate expression for the rotation in polarization predicted by heterotic string theory within the wkb approximation .",
    "we analysed the data for distant quasars and radio galaxies to determine if the effect is present in the data .",
    "we find a marginally significant effect .",
    "however the correlation is caused primarily by two largest redshift points and the effect is lost after these points are eliminated .",
    "hence we find that the data does not show significant correlation but the large redshift points are suggestive that a signal might exist .",
    "this should be thoroughly investigated by accummulating more data at the largest redshifts .",
    "we have also determined the limits on the string theory parameters that are imposed by the current polarization data from distant quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "we , furthermore , like to point out that all these calculations were done taking dilaton as a massless scalar .",
    "as explained in the introduction , one of the biggest problem in string theory is to find a mechanism to remove this massless dilaton from present day physics .",
    "one expects that a potential for dilaton will be generated in string theory through some non - perturbative effects and the dilaton will sit at the minimum of the potential picking up a mass . as the mecanism of how precisely this should happen is still not clear in string theory , we have not dealt with such a scenario in this paper .",
