    "activity in dwarf stars , as measured through the ratios of h@xmath0 and x - ray luminosities to bolometric luminosities , drops significantly in spectral types later than m7 , and is possibly dominated by flares ( liebert et al .",
    "1999 ; reid et al . 1999 ; gizis et al . 2000 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "in addition , the dependence of activity on rotation appears to break down in sources with spectral type later than early - mid m , so that even rapidly rotating sources ( @xmath12 km sec@xmath3 ) show a decrease in emission ( basri & marcy 1995 ; tinney & reid 1998 ) . on the other hand , the transition from a radiative - convective ( @xmath13 ) to a turbulent ( @xmath14 ) dynamo ( durney , de young & roxburgh 1993 ) around the convective mass limit of 0.3 m@xmath15 ( spectral type @xmath16 )",
    "is not accompanied by a drop in activity ( hawley , gizis & reid 1996 ) , indicating that in early m dwarfs the turbulent dynamo can sustain active coronae .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed shift to weak flaring activity in late m and l dwarfs is possibly due to a change in the nature of the dynamo , or decreased photospheric ionization levels .",
    "if radio activity follows the same pattern , then late m and l dwarfs would exhibit at most only weak flaring , and possibly weaker quiescent radio emission .",
    "in addition , guedel & benz ( 1993 ) , and benz & guedel ( 1994 ) have shown that for a broad range of coronally active stars ( up to spectral type m7 ) there is a correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosities .",
    "simply , the quiescent luminosities are related by @xmath17 hz@xmath3 , while the relation for flaring luminosities is slightly non - linear with @xmath18 hz@xmath3 for radio flares with @xmath19 erg sec@xmath3 hz@xmath3 .",
    "these relations are explained in terms of a heating process in which there is a causal relation between the radio - emitting electrons and the x - ray emitting thermal plasma .",

    "benz relations to spectral types later than m7 based on x - ray observations ( neuhuser et al .",
    "1999 ; rutledge et al .",

    "past observations seemed to confirm this prediction ( krishnamurthi , leto & linsky 1999 ) .",
    "the recent detections of an x - ray flare ( rutledge et al .",
    "2000 ) and persistent and flaring radio emission ( berger et al . 2001",
    "; hereafter b01 ) from the brown dwarf ( spectral type m9 ) pose a serious challenge to these ideas , since they demonstrate that late dwarfs can exhibit strong activity closely related to magnetic fields .",
    "the quiescent radio emission in particular indicates that the magnetic activity is persistent , contrary to h@xmath0 and x - ray observations of this source ( rutledge et al .",
    "moreover , the observed emission violates both guedel  benz relations by approximately four orders of magnitude despite the fact that is only an m9 source , hinting at a possible breakdown in the relation between radio and x - ray activity between spectral types m7 and m9 . finally ,",
    "the rapid rotation of , @xmath20 km sec@xmath3 , is puzzling given that the radio emission requires the presence of magnetic fields and ionized material , which should lead to magnetic braking .",
    "these observations raise several crucial questions : is a unique object , or do other late - type stars and brown dwarfs show similar levels of radio activity ? what is the underlying mechanism that gives rise to the emission , and is it similar to the mechanism in early m dwarfs ?",
    "is the same process responsible for the observed h@xmath0 and x - ray flares , and in some cases persistent emission ? is the activity correlated with particular physical properties ?    to address these questions , we have undertaken a survey of twelve late - type dwarfs ( ranging from m5 through t6 ) that span a wide range of properties .",
    "the purpose of this survey is to search for flaring and/or persistent radio emission , and to investigate whether this emission , and presumably magnetic field production , are correlated with particular physical properties of the sources .",
    "we summarize the properties of the survey sources in  [ sec : ss ] .",
    "the radio observations and data reduction are detailed in  [ sec : obs ] . in  [ sec : res ] we show that three of the twelve sources exhibit radio emission .",

    "in making this estimate we have assumed that the flare spectral energy distribution peaks near 8.5 ghz , and has steep spectral slopes below and above this frequency , so that the bulk of the energy release is at @xmath125 ghz .",

    "the high fraction of circular polarization in the two bright flares from and indicates that the observing frequency ( 8.46 ghz ) lies at or above the peak frequency , while observations of flares from several early m dwarfs ( leto et al . 2000 ) show that in these sources the flux drops significantly above 8.5 ghz .",
    "in fact , for the m5.5 dwarf uv cet the spectral slope above 8.5 ghz is constrained to be lower than @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that most of the energy in the observed flares in this survey is released at 8.5 ghz .",
    "one of the puzzling facts about the radio emission from ( b01 ) is that despite its spectral type ( m9 ) it violates the guedel ",
    "benz relations ( which hold for spectral types",

    "this value is @xmath132 times larger than an upper limit of @xmath133 erg sec@xmath3 from a 63.2 ksec rosat observation ( neuhuser et al . 1999 ) .",
    "even if we neglect the persistent emission , the predicted luminosity due to flares is a factor of @xmath134 too high . finally , if the observed increase in the radio flux is a statistical fluctuation rather than a genuine flare , and the flux of the source is steady at @xmath119 @xmath31jy , this emission violates the guedel ",

    "liebert et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , among others , have found a similar result for h@xmath0 flares , and noted that these flares may release more energy relative to the bolometric luminosity than in earlier spectral types .",
    "therefore , while the guedel ",
    "benz relations hold for spectral types @xmath130m7 , there is some indication from and that these relations break down around spectral type m9 .",
    "this possibly indicates a sudden change in the mechanism that gives rise to the radio emission .",
    "we note that radio and x - ray observations of a larger sample are required to test this idea comprehensively .",
    "so far , we have analyzed the radio emission in a relatively model - independent way .",
    "however , the next step is to determine the emission mechanism and physical conditions that gave rise to the flares and persistent emission .",
    "the first step in this analysis is to calculate the brightness temperatures : @xmath138 assuming that the emission is coronal , we can use @xmath139 as the size of the corona in units of jupiter radii ( linsky & gary 1983 ; dorman , nelson , & chau 1989 ; burrows , hubbard , & lunine 1989 ; chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ; leto et al .",
    "these size estimates lead to brightness temperatures of @xmath140 k during the flares , and @xmath141 k for the persistent emission .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the flares arise from much smaller regions ( e.g. coronal loops ) , in which case the brightness temperatures would exceed @xmath142 k , if @xmath143 . while we have no data to constrain the size of the coronae in these sources ,",
    "it is likely that the actual brightness temperatures are within the range defined by these estimates .",
    "the high brightness temperatures indicate that the emission is non - thermal .",
    "most likely it arises from the incoherent gyrosynchrotron or synchrotron processes ( dulk & marsh 1982 ; dulk 1985 ) , but coherent emission is also applicable if the flares actually have @xmath144 k. the high degree of circular polarization in the flares from and 2mass0036 + 18 possibly favors coherent emission , but can also be achieved in gyrosynchrotron emission ( dulk 1987 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the high frequency of the observed emission , @xmath145 ghz , favors incoherent emission since coherent emission is limited to @xmath146 ghz ( bastian , benz & gary 1998 ; stepanov et al .",
    "since it is not clear which emission process produces the observed radio emission , we estimate the magnetic field strengths and coronal densities using both .    to accurately calculate the magnetic field strengths and coronal densities in the radio active sources using the gyrosynchrotron formulation , requires detailed spectral and geometrical information , since the results depend sensitively on the high - frequency spectral slope , the viewing angle , and the geometry of the emission region ( dulk & marsh 1982 ; dulk 1985 ) . for approximate values we can instead use the synchrotron formulation , along with the approximation @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the minimum lorentz factor of the radio - emitting electron distribution . for and 2mass0036 + 18",
    ", the lorentz factor is @xmath149 , while for it is @xmath150 .",
    "the resulting magnetic field strengths are @xmath151 g in and 2mass0036 + 18 , and @xmath152 g in .",
    "these values should be treated with caution , and they can vary upward by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "in fact , if we choose characteristic values for the radio spectral index and the viewing angle , we find gyrosynchrotron values of @xmath153 g for and 2mass0036 + 18 , and @xmath154 g for .    for comparison , the solar magnetic field as inferred from a multi - wavelength study of three solar flares ( kundu et al .",
    "2001 ) ranges from @xmath155 g at the loop footpoints , while fields in active early m dwarfs reach strengths of a few kg ( saar & linsky 1985 ; haisch , strong & rodono 1991 ; johns - krull & valenti 1996 ; stepanov et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the total number of electrons in the synchrotron formulation is easily calculated using @xmath156 . however , to calculate the densities we have to know the geometry of the flare region . in the gyrosynchrotron formulation , using the magnetic field values quoted above , we find column densities of @xmath157 @xmath158 for and 2mass0036 + 18 , and @xmath159 @xmath158 for .",
    "these densities are similar to those calculated for solar and m dwarf flares ( bruggmann & magun 1990 ; stepanov et al .",
    "2001 ) .    alternatively ,",
    "if the flare brightness temperatures are of the order of @xmath142 k , then we must use coherent emission to estimate the magnetic field strengths and the densities .",
    "there are two main coherent processes , electron cyclotron maser ( ecm ) , and plasma emission , which operate at the fundamental frequencies @xmath160 mhz and @xmath161 khz , respectively .",
    "recently , stepanov et al . (",
    "2001 ) have shown for the flare star ad leonis that emission due to the ecm process is strongly damped by thermal electrons in the corona .",
    "they conclude that for typical coronal temperatures and densities plasma emission is the more likely process .",
    "plasma radiation is primarily emitted at @xmath162 .",
    "thus , we can simply use @xmath163 ghz to find @xmath164 @xmath7 , and approximate @xmath165 to find @xmath166 g. these values are consistent with the gyrosynchrotron - derived values .",
    "therefore , we conclude that regardless of the exact emission mechanism or magnetic field configuration , the observations are consistent with magnetic fields in the range @xmath167 g , and coronal densities of the order of @xmath168 @xmath7 .",
    "we discuss the implications of the inferred magnetic field values and coronal densities in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we next investigate whether our radio data support a particular model of coronal particle acceleration .",
    "heating can be due to acoustic waves generated by the same turbulent convection that presumably gives rise to the magnetic fields ( bohn 1984 ; ulmschneider , theurer , & musielak 1996 ) .",

    "( 1996 ) provide an estimate of the total flux due to acoustic heating , @xmath169 , as a function of effective temperature and surface gravity based on an extended kolmogorov turbulent energy spectrum .",
    "we use their table 1 to estimate @xmath170 for our survey sources . in comparison ,",
    "the values for the observed radio flares are @xmath171 ( figures  [ fig : lumvsspec1 ] and [ fig : lumvsspec2 ] ) .",
    "therefore acoustic heating can not supply the necessary energy to power the flares , and similarly , can not explain the persistent emission with @xmath172 .",
    "a more plausible heating mechanism is magnetic reconnection ( bastian , benz & gary 1998 ; sturrock 1999 ) .",
    "this model can also explain the persistent emission if it is a superposition of weaker flares .",
    "in the context of this model , the flares are produced when coronal magnetic loops reconnect , release energy , and create a current sheet along which ambient electrons are accelerated .",
    "recent work on three - dimensional reconnection shows that the particles are accelerated into a power - law energy distribution ( schopper , birk & lesch 1999 ) , as required for the synchrotron and gyrosynchrotron discussion in ",
    "[ sec : mag ] .",
    "the accelerated electrons drive an outflow of hot plasma into the corona as they interact with , and heat chromospheric material ( i.e. chromospheric evaporation ) .",
    "the interaction of the outflowing plasma with the same electons produces x - ray emission via the bremsstrahlung process ( neupert 1968 ; hawley et al .",
    "1995 ; guedel et al .",
    "this so - called neupert effect indicates that there is a _ causal _ connection between particle acceleration , which is the source of radio emission , and plasma heating , which results in x - ray emission .",
    "this connection explains the phenomenological guedel ",
    "benz relations .",
    "it is possible that the violation of the guedel ",
    "benz relations in the emission from and indicates that the neupert effect no longer holds in late m dwarfs .",
    "a direct test of this possibility requires simultaneous observations of such sources in the radio and x - rays .",
    "future surveys of activity in late m and l dwarfs would be considerably more effective if they followed such a strategy .",
    "it is also possible that the energy source for the radio emission in the active survey sources and is an altogether different process , in which case a causal relation between radio emission and activity in other bands would not be required . at present",
    "it is not possible to distinguish between these different possibilities , but future observations with wide spectral coverage will likely provide an answer .",
    "before we proceed to interpret the results of this survey in the context of correlations between radio activity and physical source parameters , we summarize the main observational results : ( i ) the observed flares have approximately equal luminosity , ratio of radio to bolometric luminosity , and released energy , ( ii ) the persistent emission has approximately the same luminosity , and it appears to be variable , ( iii ) lhs2065 has an upper limit on the ratio of radio to bolometric luminosity which is lower than the detected persistent emission , despite being active in h@xmath0 , ( iv ) the emission from , as well as , violates the guedel ",
    "benz relations by several orders of magnitude , ( v ) the inferred magnetic field strengths are @xmath5 g , and the coronal densities are @xmath6 @xmath7 , and ( vi ) the heating mechanism is probably magnetic reconnection , but it is possible that the neupert effect is violated .",
    "a comparison of these results to the radio properties of ( b01 ) is illustrative .",
    "the peak luminosity of the flares from all four sources varies by only a factor of two , and the energy release only varies by a factor of five .",
    "the ratio of the flare peak luminosity to the bolometric luminosity of each source is @xmath173 , and the ratio for the quiescent luminosities is @xmath174 to @xmath175 ( figures  [ fig : lumvsspec1 ] and [ fig : lumvsspec2 ] ) .",
    "we find similar results when we compare this sample to other m dwarfs that have been observed in the radio .",
    "for example , flares have been detected from the dm3.5e dwarf ad leo ( stepanov et al .",
    "2001 ) , the dm4e dwarf rst 137b ( lim 1993 ) , and the dm5.5e dwarf proxima centauri ( lim , white & slee 1996 ) , with ratios of @xmath176 that are in the range of @xmath177 to @xmath178 .",
    "these values are plotted in figures  [ fig : lumvsspec1 ] and [ fig : lumvsspec2]a , and we can see that with the exception of the flare from proxima centauri , which is fainter by approximately two orders of magnitude , these values are similar to those observed in this survey and in .",
    "the flat distribution of @xmath104 for the flares from the sources with spectral types m8-l3.5 , and perhaps m3.5-l3.5 ( with the exception of proxima centauri ) , possibly points to a `` saturation '' effect , in which @xmath179 reaches a maximum value that is independent of spectral type or other physical properties .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper and data to assess this possibility in detail .",
    "the pattern of persistent radio emission in early m dwarfs through l dwarfs is more puzzling . in figures  [ fig : lumvsspec1 ] and [ fig : lumvsspec2]b we plot the ratios of persistent radio to bolometric luminosities for the detections and upper limits in this survey , the upper limits from krishnamurthi , leto & linsky ( 1999 ) , and detections in the range m3-m6.5 ( cash , charles & johnson 1980 ; pallavicini , wilosn & lang 1985 ; leto et al .",
    "2000 ) . despite the small sample",
    ", there is a clear increase in the ratio of persistent radio to bolometric luminosity over the range m3-l3.5 ( dashed and dotted lines in figure  [ fig : lumvsspec2]b ) .",
    "this increase is in direct contradiction with the steep decline in h@xmath0 activity beyond spectral type m7 ( gizis et al .",
    "in fact , while the h@xmath0 activity drops by approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude between m7 and l3.5 , the radio activity appears to _ increase _ by a similar amount in the same spectral range .",
    "this indicates that the radio and h@xmath0 activity are probably not correlated at the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "another interesting result from figure  [ fig : lumvsspec2]b is that there are several upper limits , which appear to fall below the apparent steady increase in @xmath104 .",
    "these upper limits are for 2mass1507@xmath116 ( l5 ) and ( t6 ) from this survey , and five sources from krishnamurthi , leto & linsky ( 1999 ) : vb8 ( m7 ) , vb10 ( m8 ) , gl569b ( m8.5 ) , lhs2065 ( m9 ) , and gl229b ( t ) ; we use the upper limit for lhs2065 from krishnamurthi , leto & linsky ( 1999 ) since it is approximately 3 times lower than the value measured in our survey . while some variance in activity levels within the sample of m and l dwarfs is not unexpected , it is interesting to investigate whether these source have some property which differentiates them from the detected sources . in figure",
    "[ fig : lumvsrot ] we plot the ratio of persistent radio to bolometric luminosity as a function of the source rotational velocity , and we find that of these seven sources the three with measured rotational velocities have @xmath4 km sec@xmath3 , while the detected sources have @xmath2 km sec@xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the source with the most constraining upper limit ( vb8 ) has the lowest rotational velocity in the sample , while the source with the highest value of @xmath104 ( ) has the highest rotational velocity . the upper limit on the radio activity from the fast rotator kelu1 ( krishnamurthi , leto & linsky 1999 ) , with @xmath39 km sec@xmath3 ( basri et al .",
    "2000 ) is three times higher than the detected fast rotators , and therefore does not constrain the possible relation between radio activity and rotational velocity .",
    "we note that while these sources provide tantalizing evidence for a relation between rapid rotation and radio activity , the sample is still very small .",
    "future observations of a larger sample will provide a better test of this possible relation .",
    "however , it is already possible to rule out the idea that high rotational velocities quench the magnetic dynamo through supersaturation ( randich 1998 ) , as was inferred from the drop in persistent h@xmath0 and x - ray activity in late m and l dwarfs .",
    "the most puzzling implication of the observed radio emission , regardless of its possible correlation with fast rotation , is that late m and l dwarfs posses appreciable and sustained magnetic fields , as well as high particle densities in at least some regions of their coronae .",
    "this result seems to contradict recent calculations by mohanty et al .",
    "( 2002 ) which indicate that the generation and propagation of magnetic energy decreases with decreasing effective temperature , resulting in a decrease of coronal activity in late spectral types .",
    "in addition , the presence of magnetic fields and ionized material indicates that magnetic braking should have slowed these sources down considerably .",
    "thus , it is not clear how these sources maintain such high rotational velocities .",
    "no other correlations are apparent from the data . for example",
    ", the upper limit on the young object crbr15 is approximately five times higher than the faintest detected persistent emission , and therefore precludes any conclusion on the role of age in the production of radio emission .",
    "similarly , the upper limits on emission from the confirmed binary systems and are approximately forty times higher than the detected sources , and it is therefore not possible to assess the role of binary interaction in the production of radio emission .",
    "we detected flaring and persistent emission at 8.46 ghz from the m and l dwarfs , 2mass0036 + 18 , and , but no emission from the nine other survey sources .",
    "these observations lead to several interesting conclusions , which are puzzling given the decrease in persistent h@xmath0 and x - ray activity in late m and l dwarfs .",
    "the flares and persistent emission from the three survey sources , as well as ( b01 ) have similar properties .",
    "in particular , the emission from these sources has similar @xmath104 values , and energy release .",
    "this probably points to a common emission mechanism and physical conditions ( e.g. magnetic fields ) in these sources .",
    "in addition , while the dependence of h@xmath0 activity on rotation appears to break down in early - mid m dwarfs , the radio active sources for which the rotational velocity is known are rapid rotators , with the most luminous source in the sample , , having the highest rotational velocity , @xmath39 km sec@xmath3 . at the same time",
    ", the limits on radio activity in three slow rotators from krishnamurthi , leto & linsky ( 1999 ) indicate that they are less active than the detected sources in this sample , pointing to a possible relation between rotation and radio activity .",
    "regardless of whether a correlation actually exists , the radio emission requires magnetic fields and coronal densities that should have resulted in significant slow - down due to magnetic braking .",
    "it is still not clear how these sources maintain their rapid rotation .",

    "the predicted x - ray emission is over - luminous relative to x - ray observations .",
    "this indicates that radio and x - ray activity are no longer correlated in some late m dwarfs , in the same way that radio and h@xmath0 activity appear to be uncorrelated .",
    "moreover , it appears that the breakdown in the guedel ",
    "benz relations occurs over a narrow spectral type range , m7-m9 .    the observed persistent emission is clearly variable , possibly on a timescale of the order of one hour ( figures  [ fig : tvlm ] and [ fig : mass2 ] ) .",
    "it is possible that this emission is simply a superposition of weak flares , in which case the activity duty cycle is @xmath180 .",
    "however , if this component is truly persistent over long timescales , it means that our understanding of magnetic field generation in very low mass stars is far from complete .",
    "longer , multi - frequency observations are required for a thorough understanding of the origin of this emission component .    to address the possible correlation between rotation and radio activity , as well as the differences between the activity indicators ( i.e. radio , h@xmath0 , and x - rays ) , and to gain a deeper understanding of physical processes in dwarf stars it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive , multi - wavelength survey of nearby m and l dwarfs .",

    "<S> we present very large array observations of twelve late m and l dwarfs in the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> the observed sources were chosen to cover a wide range of physical characteristics  spectral type , rotation , age , binarity , and x - ray and h@xmath0 activity  to determine the role of these properties in the production of radio emission , and hence magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> three of the twelve sources , , 2mass j0036159 + 182110 , and , were observed to flare and also exhibit persistent emission , indicating that magnetic activity is not quenched at the bottom of the main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the radio emission extends to spectral type l3.5 , and there is no apparent decrease in the ratio of flaring luminosities to bolometric luminosities between m8@xmath1l3.5 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , contrary to the significant drop in persistent h@xmath0 activity beyond spectral type m7 , the persistent radio activity appears to steadily increase between m3@xmath1l3.5 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the radio emission from violates the phenomenological relations between the radio and x - ray luminosities of coronally active stars , hinting that radio and x - ray activity are also uncorrelated at the bottom of the main sequence ; an even stronger violation was found for the brown dwarf lp944 - 20 . </S>",
    "<S> the radio active sources that have measured rotational velocities are rapid rotators , @xmath2 km sec@xmath3 , while the upper limits on radio activity in slowly - rotating late m dwarfs ( @xmath4 km sec@xmath3 ) from this survey and from the literature are lower than these detections . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide tantalizing evidence that rapidly - rotating late m and l dwarfs are more likely to be radio active . </S>",
    "<S> this possible correlation is puzzling given that the observed radio emission requires sustained magnetic fields of @xmath5 g and densities of @xmath6 @xmath7 , indicating that the active sources should have slowed down considerably due to magnetic braking .    </S>",
