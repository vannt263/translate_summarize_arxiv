    "solar oscillations are a unique tool to infer conditions inside the sun .",
    "they have been recorded with extreme precision since 1996 with the michelson doppler imager ( mdi , ) onboard the solar and heliospheric ( soho ) space telescope .",
    "large - scale rotation inside the sun can be estimated by inversion of the frequencies of millions of global modes of oscillation ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "rotation is known to vary with time in the solar interior at the level of about @xmath1  ms@xmath2(_e.g .",
    "_ , ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "these variations , known as torsional oscillations , consist of bands of faster and slower rotation that migrate in latitude as the eleven - year solar magnetic cycle develops .",
    "torsional oscillations may be driven by the lorentz force due to a dynamo wave @xcite .",
    "other explanations have been proposed ( see and references therein ) , including the suggestion by that torsional oscillations are driven by horizontal pressure gradients caused by photospheric magnetic activity .",
    "long time averages of surface doppler measurements have shown the existence of a flow from the equator to the poles with an amplitude of 1020  ms@xmath2 .",
    "an introduction to the theory of solar meridional circulation is provided by .",
    "temporal variations in the meridional flow have been reported by several authors . by tracking the small photospheric magnetic features , , , and found a significant change in the meridional flow near sunspot latitudes , implying a solar - cycle variation .",
    "variations in the surface doppler meridional velocity have been detected by , in particular at latitudes above @xmath3 .",
    "local helioseismology ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) also provides reasonable measurements of the meridional circulation for latitudes below about @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the time - varying component of the meridional flow with respect to a long - term average does not exceed @xmath5  ms@xmath2and is consistent with a small near - surface inflow toward active latitudes @xcite and an outflow from active latitudes at depths greater than 20  mm @xcite .",
    "as discussed by , these variations would appear to be caused by localized flows around localized regions of magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we provide independent measurements of the temporal variations of the meridional circulation near the solar surface and at a depth of about 60  mm . for the near - surface meridional flow ,",
    "we use an original technique , which consists of measuring the advection of the supergranulation pattern @xcite .",
    "the deeper meridional flow is calibrated from an earlier time - distance helioseismology observation by .",
    "the meridional circulation measurements at these two depths are compared , in particular by looking at the eleven - year periodicity of the flows ( section [ sec.obs ] ) .",
    "our study of meridional circulation confirms previous observations ( listed above ) and is complementary to the analysis of zonal flows by .",
    "second , we wish to compare the observations with a theoretical model @xcite based on a flux - transport dynamo combined with a geostrophic flow caused by increased radiative loss in the active region belt , according to spruit s ( 2003 ) original idea .",
    "section  [ sec.model ] provides a description of the model with a focus on meridional flows , since this aspect of the model has not been discussed elsewhere in detail . to our knowledge",
    ", this model is the only existing quantitative model of the solar - cycle dependence of internal flows : it is natural to ask whether it is consistent with the observations .",
    "the comparison between the observations and the model ( section [ sec.discussion ] ) is encouraging , although some inconsistencies can not be ignored .",
    "the method we employ to infer flows near the solar surface is based on the analysis of , which was originally applied to a single data set from 1996 .",
    "here we use a series of mdi full - disk doppler images covering the period 19962002 .",
    "each year , two to three months of continuous dopplergrams are available for analysis ( mdi dynamics runs ) . the mdi data after 2002 were not used simply because we are analyzing an existing pre - processed data set .",
    "dopplergrams were tracked at the carrington rotational velocity to remove the main component of rotation .",
    "f_-mode time - distance helioseismology @xcite to obtain every 12  hour a @xmath6 map of the horizontal divergence of the flow field @xmath7  mm below the photosphere .",
    "the main component of the divergence signal is due to supergranulation . for",
    "any given target latitude ( @xmath8 ) we considered a longitudinal section of the data @xmath9 wide in latitude . using a local plane - parallel approximation in the neighborhood of latitude @xmath8 , the divergence signal was interpolated onto a cartesian grid sampled at @xmath10  mm in the @xmath11 ( prograde ) and @xmath12 ( northward ) coordinates .",
    "the divergence signal was decomposed into its harmonic components @xmath13 to obtain a local power spectrum @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the horizontal wavevector and @xmath16 is the angular frequency . at fixed @xmath17 ,",
    "we fit for two functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 and a horizontal vector @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "this representation fits the data adequately .",
    "as was done by , we interpret @xmath22 to be a horizontal flow causing a doppler shift @xmath23 .",

    ", we use a simple calibration of @xmath28 at a depth based on the observation by ( global - mode helioseismology ) that the amplitude of the time - varying component of the zonal flow is nearly independent of depth .",

    ", width=302 ]    [ fig.compare_phase ]    the eleven - year periodic components of the meridional and zonal flows are shown in figure  [ fig.surf ] .",
    "the torsional - oscillation pattern is clearly seen at both depths with an amplitude and a phase comparable to previous measurements ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "the meridional flow also contains a significant eleven - year periodic component . near the solar surface ,",
    "the residuals indicate the presence of a north  south inflow toward the mean latitude of activity ( _ e.g. _ , ; ) , while the data are consistent with a horizontal outflow from the mean latitude of activity deeper into the convection zone ( _ e.g. _ , ; ) .",
    "figure  [ fig.compare_ampli ] gives the amplitudes of the time - varying components of the flows ( @xmath41 ) . under the assumption ( section [ sec.obsdeep ] ) that @xmath46 does not vary appreciably with depth ( @xmath33  ms@xmath2latitudinal average )",
    ", then the amplitude of the time - varying meridional flow ( @xmath47 ) is also found to be approximately independent of depth ( @xmath48  ms@xmath2at @xmath30 latitude ) .",
    "the evidence that the time - varying components of the meridional flow near the surface and deeper in the interior are anti - correlated is given in figure  [ fig.compare_phase ] , which shows the difference in @xmath49 at the two depths .",
    "on the contrary , there is no significant phase variation with depth for the zonal flow .",
    "the model results presented here are based on a non - kinematic flux - transport dynamo model developed recently by rempel .",
    "this model combines the differential rotation and meridional flow model of with a flux - transport dynamo similar to the models of and .",
    "we emphasize that this model is intended to give a fundamental understanding of the basic cycle properties and their relation to observable variations of zonal and meridional flows .",
    "therefore we focus here only on axisymmetric and north  south averaged quantities .",
    "details of the model can be found in . since a detailed comparison with observed torsional oscillations can be found in and , we focus here on the meridional flow variations .",
    "the differential rotation model utilizes a meanfield reynolds - stress approach that parametrizes the turbulent angular momentum transport (; @xmath50-effect ) leading to the observed equatorial acceleration . in this model",
    "the tachocline is forced through a uniform rotation boundary condition at the lower boundary of the computational domain . a meridional circulation , as required for a flux - transport dynamo , follows self - consistently through the coriolis force resulting from the differential rotation .    the computed differential rotation and meridional flow are used to advance the magnetic field in the flux - transport dynamo model , while the magnetic field is allowed to feed back through the meanfield lorentz - force @xmath51 ( the contribution of the fluctuating part @xmath52 is not well known and neglected here ) .",
    "we find in our model that the lorentz - force feedback can only account for the poleward propagating branch of the torsional oscillations , while the equatorward propagating branch in latitudes beneath @xmath53 requires additional physics .",
    "parametrizing the idea proposed by that the low - latitude torsional oscillation is a geostrophic flow caused by increased radiative loss in the active region belt ( due to small scale magnetic flux ) leads in our model to a surface oscillations pattern in good agreement with observations . in order to force a torsional oscillation with around @xmath7 nhz amplitude , a temperature variation of around @xmath54  k",
    "is required . as a side effect",
    "the cooling produces close to the surface ( in our model at @xmath55 ) an inflow into the active - region belt of around @xmath56  ms@xmath2 .",
    "we incorporated this process by adding a surface - cooling term that is dependent on the toroidal - field strength at the base of the convection zone , which is assumed to be the source for active - region magnetic field ( the small scale flux required for the surface - cooling is a consequence of the decay of active - regions ) .",
    "observations show that the low - latitude branch of torsional - oscillations starts around one to two years before the sunspots of the new cycle appear .",
    "it is possible that magnetic flux rises towards the surface without forming sunspots in the beginning of a cycle providing enough small - scale magnetic field , this is however currently neither confirmed nor ruled out by observations .",
    "alternative explanations for the low - latitude branch of torsional oscillations such as the models of , , and are based on the longitudinal component of the lorentz force .",
    "recently @xcite showed that torsional - oscillations forced that way are close to the taylor - proudman state ( alignment of phase with the axis of rotation ) , which contradicts observations .",
    "in addition , the resulting meridional surface - flow has the wrong sign ( active region belt outflow ) . despite some shortcomings ,",
    "the model of is currently the only proposed explanation that is consistent with the observed meridional and zonal - flow variations close to the solar surface .",

    "figure [ fig : model ] summarizes the results of the model in latitudes below @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ fig : model]a shows the temperature fluctuation ( color shades ) caused by increased surface cooling in the active region belt .",
    "the contour lines indicate the magnetic butterfly diagram computed from the toroidal field at the base of the convection zone in the model .",
    "figure  [ fig : model]b shows cycle variations of the angular velocity ( torsional oscillations ) and figure  [ fig : model]c shows cycle variations of the horizontal meridional flow velocity . at the equatorward side of the active region belt",
    "( indicated by the butterfly diagram ) the rotation rate is increased , which is consistent with the increased poleward meridional flow transporting material toward the axis of rotation . on the poleward side of the active region belt the rotation rate is lower , while the meridional - flow perturbation is equatorward . at a depth of around @xmath62 mm ( figure [ fig : model]d )",
    "the meridional - flow perturbation is almost anti - correlated to the surface flow ( active - region belt outflow ) , indicating that the surface cooling drives a flow system that closes in the upper third of the convection zone .",
    "the flow amplitude at a depth of @xmath62 mm is around one order of magnitude lower compared to the surface flow due to the significant increase in density .",
    "we presented a model that is qualitatively consistent with the observations , in particular the phase of the solar - cycle variations of the flows . since the surface - cooling term is parametrized , the model can only make predictions about the relative amplitude of zonal and meridional flows at different depths , and not about the absolute values . near the surface ,",
    "the model is in agreement with the data : the relative amplitudes of the torsional oscillation and the time - varying component of the meridional flow and their relative phase are reproduced well .",
    "deeper in the interior , it appears that the model underestimates the amplitude of the time variations of the meridional flow by an order of magnitude ; however , the flow variation is in antiphase to the surface flow as seen in the data .",
    "the lower velocity at depth in the dynamo model is a consequence of mass conservation ( strong increase in density with depth ) .",
    "the much larger outflow which is observed in the data can not be balanced by an inflow close to the surface unless the outflow is confined to a very narrow layer .",
    "overall , it is fair to say that the model is encouraging .",
    "alternative models explaining low - latitude torsional oscillations through the action of the longitudinal lorentz force tend to produce zonal flow patterns in the taylor - proudman state @xcite and meridional outflows rather than inflows close to the surface . on the other hand ,",
    "zonal flows appear during solar minimum when no active regions are present .",
    "this requires , in the case of thermal forcing , that a sufficient amount of magnetic flux is present in the form of small scale flux elements not evident in synoptic magnetograms ( see _ e.g. _ , section 6.3 ) .",
    "also a local treatment of the regions of strong magnetic - field concentrations ( sunspots and active regions ) might be necessary to obtain a better match between the model and the data",
