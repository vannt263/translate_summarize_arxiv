    "recent sensitive and high - resolution 21  cm observations , carried out as part of the alfalfa survey @xcite have revealed a population of isolated ultra - compact high - velocity clouds ( uchvcs ) ( * ? ? ? * hereafter g10 ) , and catalogued by @xcite ( hereafter a13 ) .",
    "the angular diameters are @xmath6  arcmin , and the uchvcs are significantly smaller than the @xmath7-sized chvcs , discussed and analyzed by @xcite and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter smw02 ) .",
    "the uchvcs are isolated kinematically and spatially from the well - studied and extended hvc complexes ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the a13 uchvc catalogue contains @xmath8 objects found in data covering around 2,800 square degrees .",
    "the radial velocities of the clouds range from -280 to 270  ( gsr ) . around 20 of the uchvcs",
    "are only marginally resolved , with apparent sizes that may be affected by the arecibo beam , and these compact sources are the focus of our study .",
    "the observed 21  cm fluxes range from 0.6 to 1.8 jy  , and the typical central hi column densities averaged over the @xmath9 arecibo beam are @xmath10 to @xmath11",
    ". the survey does not provide any distance constraints , and the locations of the uchvcs are unknown . the hi masses scale as the square of the distance , and they the range from @xmath12 to @xmath13  , where @xmath14 is the distance in mpc .",
    "g10 and a13 have suggested that some of the newly discovered uchvcs might be low - mass optically faint dwarf galaxies that are sufficiently gas rich to be detectable 21  cm sources within the  local volume \" or local group .    in the local group ,",
    "the number of known dwarf galaxies has increased significantly in recent years with sensitive observations carried out as part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "most of the optically faint dwarfs are gas - poor systems with old stellar populations , are very dark - matter dominated , and are located within the virial radius of the milky way ( a few 100 kpc ) .",
    "remarkably , the observed stellar velocity dispersions imply a common dm mass scale for the dwarf galaxies ( strigari  et  al  2008 , hereafter  s08 ; walker  2012 ) . for @xmath15-band luminosities , @xmath16 , from @xmath17 to @xmath18",

    "one sdss dwarf that does contain significant amounts of gas is leo  t , discovered by @xcite , and detected in 21  cm in the hipass survey @xcite .",

    "( by definition and throughout this paper , the projected hi half - mass radius equals the observed 21  cm half - flux radius . ) as a 21  cm source , leo  t is similar to the uchvcs in angular size , but it has a somewhat higher hi column density . within the 4 arecibo beam the average hi column is @xmath26  .",
    "recently , one of the uchvcs , hi102145.0 + 180501 , was observed optically by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter g13 ) and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter r13 ) and found to be an ultra - faint dwarf galaxy .",
    "g13 dubbed this galaxy leo  p. its radial velocity is 177  ( gsr ) and the v - band luminosity is @xmath27 .",
    "the optical observations enable a distance determination and place leo  p at @xmath28  mpc , outside but possibly bound to the local group .",
    "the distance constraints are an important advance in estimating characteristic distances for the uchvcs",
    ".    for leo  p , combined arecibo and evla observations give a total hi mass of @xmath29  and the peak hi column density is @xmath30 .",
    "the angular hi half - mass radius is @xmath31 ( or @xmath32  kpc ) , and the total dynamical mass , @xmath33 , within @xmath34  is @xmath35  .",
    "g13 find evidence for significant rotation in leo  p , with ordered motions across the source .",
    "leo  p is thus an optical dwarf galaxy discovered as a uchvc via 21  cm observations .",
    "so far it is the only uchvc in which stars have been detected .",
    "except for rotation , leo  p appears to be very similar to leo  t. both have young stellar populations and significant amounts of gas ( with hi to stellar mass ratios of @xmath36 ) , and both are dark - matter dominated systems , with dm consituting 85% of the dynamical mass in leo  t. the similarity of leo  t to the uchvcs , and the recent identification of leo  p with hi102145.0 + 180501 suggests that at least some and perhaps many of the unresolved uchvcs are gas - rich dwarf galaxies but optically very faint . if some of the uchvcs are local group galaxies , this extra population may help to resolve the  missing satellite problem \" @xcite .    in this paper we present models for leo  t and the uchvcs as spherical , non - rotating , hydrostatically supported hi clouds in gravitationally dominant dm minihalos , or dm dominated dwarf galaxies .",
    "we model the distribution of the warm neutral medium ( wnm , @xmath37  k ) , including truncation of the neutral gas clouds by the present - day photoionizing metagalactic radiation field . for this purpose",
    "we employ and extend the minihalo modeling methods presented in smw02 .    for the minihalos we assume flat - core dm density profiles .",
    "we show that for flat - core dm halos , the strigari mass , @xmath38 , is naturally expected for ( tidally stripped ) subhalos at redshift zero , and only weakly dependent on their total masses ( or scale velocities ) .",
    "we also show that adopting flat - core halos resolves the  over - abundance problem \" of massive dark satellites around the mw found in simulations .",
    "for leo  t we explicitly fit the observed hi column density profile , and also show that constraints set on the dm subhalo properties by just the hi sizes provide consistent results .",
    "thus leo  t validates our proposed method of using the half - mass hi radius as a constraint on the minihalo parameters for the uchvcs , when higher resolution observations become available .",
    "we find that for leo  t , the best - fitting dm halos have @xmath39  .",
    "for the uchvcs we predict the physical and angular hi sizes given the observed 21  cm fluxes and distance dependent hi masses . with future high - resolution observations of the uchvc",
    "sizes our models can be used to constrain the distances to the sources or the properties of the confining dm halos .",
    "for example , for a typical barely resolved uchvc with a 21  cm flux equal to 0.9  jy  ( see a13 )  embedded in a typical ( median ) unstripped subhalo we predict physical hi projected half - mass radii of 0.18 to 0.35 kpc ( or angular sizes of 0.6 to 2.1 arcmin ) for distances between 300 kpc and 2 mpc .    in   [ sec_conf ]",
    "we discuss pressure versus gravitational confinement of the uchvcs , and argue that for large distances pressure confinement is unlikely . in   [ sec_models_dm ]",
    "we describe our minihalo potentials and cosmological scaling relations . in   [ sec_mass_scale ] we show that subhalos with cored profiles naturally produce the strigari mass scale and also resolve the mass discrepancy between simulated and observed dwarf satellite galaxies of the milky way .",
    "then , in   [ sec_models_gas ]",
    "we write down analytic formulae for the wnm hi cloud sizes in terms of the halo parameters . in   [ sec_analysis ] we present our detailed numerical fits for leo  t and then present our model predictions for the physical ( and angular ) hi half - mass radii of the uchvcs for a wide range of assumed distances , for minihalos around the typical cosmological relation .",
    "we discuss and summarize in   [ sec_summary ] .",
    "how are the uchvcs confined ?",
    "could they be pressure confined ? for distances @xmath40 this appears unlikely if they are compact ( @xmath31 ) , as indicated by the high - resolution evla observations of leo  p. for a pressure - confined ( uniform - density ) spherical cloud , the central peak column density is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the gas volume density , and  is the ( projected ) hi half - mass radius . the average column density over the half - flux radius , @xmath43 , is lower than the peak column density , and we can derive a lower bound for the gas volume density . for @xmath44  and an hi mass of @xmath45  ( for @xmath46 and a typical uchvc 21  cm flux of 0.9  jy  ) , the implied thermal pressure is @xmath47  k for @xmath37  k warm neutral medium ( wnm )",
    ". this may be too large for any ( hot ) confining medium for local group distances , since the implied baryonic masses ( and x - ray emissivities ) would be too large .",
    "for example , for a uniform - density medium , or assuming that at a distance @xmath48 the density of the hot gas ( hot ionized medium - him ) is not larger than the mean density within @xmath48 , the total hot gas mass is @xmath49 where @xmath50  k. for @xmath51  k , and hot gas at a virial - temperature @xmath52 , we have that @xmath53  for @xmath54  mpc , comparable to the total dynamical mass of the local group ( @xcite ) including the milky way and andromeda . pressure confinement might be viable for uchvcs at much lower distances , or if @xmath55 .",
    "gravitational confinement in dark - matter minihalos is a plausible alternative for uchvcs that are tracing dwarf galaxies . for gravitational confinement",
    "the pressure at the outer boundary provides a limit on the ambient pressure outside the cloud , as we find for leo  t (   [ analysis_leot ] ) .",
    "in our study we consider gravitationally - confined models , and adopt flat - core @xcite profiles for the dark - matter density distributions and gravitational potentials .",
    "our choice of the burkert profile is motivated by observations of constant density cores in low - mass dwarf galaxies @xcite , but see also @xcite for evidence that not all galaxies have flat cores .",
    "furthermore , as we show in   [ sec_mass_scale ] , cored profiles naturally reproduce the strigari mass and also resolve the  mass discrepancy \" or predicted overabundance of massive dark subhalos around the milky way found in simulations ( e.g. @xcite , hereafter bk11 ) .",
    "for a spherically symmetric dm density distribution , @xmath56 , and for the burkert profile ( smw02 ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the radial distance from the halo center , and  is the dm scale radius . for the burkert profile ,",

    "the halo scale velocity  is defined via the relation @xmath64 the maximal circular velocity @xmath65 and @xmath66 occurs at @xmath67 .",
    "given a functional form , @xmath72 , for the density profile , an arbitrary spherical halo may be selected by specifying any two independent parameters , such as  and .",
    "however , in general , the halo parameters are correlated in a manner that depends on redshift , environment and cosmological model .",
    "we adopt the lcdm correlation at redshift @xmath1 , as found in the _ aquarius _ simulation @xcite for ( a ) subhalos in which some of the dark - matter has been tidally stripped by encounters with the mw , and ( b ) for more distant unstripped subhalos ( not yet interacting ) .",
    "the _ aquarius _",
    "simulations assume collisionless dark - matter , and these naturally give rise to nfw profiles .",
    "however , as recently shown by @xcite in their study of the flat - cored halos that appear for self - interacting dark - matter , the cosmological springel correlations remain unaltered , and we adopt those here for the burkert profiles .    for tidally stripped subhalos the _ aquarius _ correlation",
    "may be expressed as @xmath73 where  is the number of standard deviations from the median correlation and  is in  .",
    "unstripped subhalos are less concentrated , and @xmath74    in our discussion of the mw satellites (   [ sec_mass_scale ] ) and our derivation of the strigari mass we assume stripped subhalos with the view that the gas - poor sloan dwarfs are all nearby ( 25 to 250 kpc , s08 ) inside the virial radius of the mw ( @xmath75  kpc , @xcite ) , and have plausibly interacted with the galaxy .",
    "we consider leo  t and the uchvcs as more distant objects , and for them we assume the cosmological correlation for unstripped subhalos .    for stripped burkert halos ,",

    "@xmath82 only slightly offset compared to stripped subhalos .",
    "similar expressions may be developed for nfw profiles , but we do not write them down here .",
    "we now show that the strigari dm mass scale of @xmath18  within 300  pc arises naturally if stripped flat - core burkert halos are assumed .",
    "we also show that the predicted overabundance of dark massive subhalos around the mw is moderated with this assumption .",
    "the total dark matter mass enclosed within a radius @xmath59 can be written as @xmath83 , with @xmath84 as given by equations   or  .",
    "given a cosmological relation between  and , and for a given value of , @xmath85 is a function of one halo parameter , for any _ fixed _ radius @xmath59 . for burkert halos this function has a maximum mass , occurring at @xmath86  pc/= 0.55 .",
    "in contrast , for nfw profiles , the mass within any @xmath59 varies monotonically . in figure [ fig : mass_scale ] we plot 300 , the mass within @xmath87  pc , as a function of the scale velocity ,  for burkert ( left panels ) and nfw halos ( right ) , and for stripped ( top panels ) and unstripped ( bottom ) subhalos .    for stripped subhalos , we find that the maximal 300  for a given  is @xmath88 ( occurring at @xmath89 ) . for unstripped subhalos , the maximal 300  is lower , and @xmath90 ( the superscripts  st \" and  un \" refer to stripped and unstripped subhalos , respectively . )",
    "the maximum is broad and equations   and   give the  characteristic \" 300 for any value of .",
    "it is thus evident that for tidally stripped subhalos ( equation  [ [ eq : m300max1 ] ] ) , typical ( median ) burkert halos are consistent with the observed strigari 300  range for mw dwarfs with the characteristic mass , @xmath91 , ranging from @xmath92 to @xmath93 for  between -2 and 2 . for = 0 , @xmath94 , and this is essentially the strigari mass , of @xmath95 .",
    "we refer to these @xmath96 halos as  strigari halos \" . for unstripped subhalos , the characteristic mass is lower by a factor of 0.6 .",
    "we predict that more distant low - mass dwarfs will have on - average lower characteristic masses within their central 300  pc , with @xmath97  .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mass_scale ] ( see also @xcite ) , nfw subhalos are more massive than burkert subhalos for any . for stripped nfw subhalos ( top panel ) and for @xmath96 ,",
    "300  increases by a factor of 7 , from @xmath98 to @xmath99  , for  from 10 to 50  .",
    "however , for stripped burkert profiles 300  varies by less than a factor of 2 across this range relative to the characteristic ( maximal ) mass of @xmath100  . from 15 to 50",
    "the variation is less than a factor of 1.3 . for median ( stripped ) nfw halos the strigari mass of @xmath18",
    "occurs for a narrow range of  near 20  ( or @xmath101  ) . for nfw ,",
    "this has motivated the idea that the common mass scale observed by s08 represents a  threshold \" with star - formation being significantly inhibited in subhalos with @xmath102  and all of the low - luminosity dwarfs having been formed in subhalos near this threshold @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if subhalo cores are flat the observed common mass scale does not necessarily reflect a threshold , but could simply be due to the very weak dependence of 300  on  ( or subhalo mass ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : mass_scale ] ( left panels ) . for flat - cored dm profiles",
    "the scale velocities of the low - luminosity dwarfs could span a wide range of  ( for @xmath103  ) , all giving the same 300 .",
    "we would then predict that as more faint galaxies are discovered ( within the mw virial radius ) 300  will remain invariant .    as a further illustration for the difference between burkert and nfw profiles , in figure  [ fig : tbtf ] we plot contours for 300 ( in units of @xmath18  ) in the  versus  parameter plane for burkert and nfw profiles ( left- and right - hand panels respectively ) . for a given  and  it is again apparent that nfw halos are significantly more massive than burkert halos .",
    "the solid dashed line is the median _ aquarius _ correlation between  and  for stripped subhalos as given by equation  . for burkert halos",
    "this line is very close to the @xmath21  contour .",
    "however , median nfw halos are much more massive .",
    "the points shown in figure [ fig : tbtf ] are the  and  values for the accreted subhalos in the _ aquarius _ ( blue ) and _ via lactea ii _",
    "( red ) simulations .",
    "bk11 plotted these data for nfw halos ( their fig .",
    "2 ) as we reproduce in the right - hand panel of our figure [ fig : tbtf ] . for nfw profiles many of the simulated subhalos are significantly more massive than the observed dwarf galaxies as specified by the strigari mass range . bk11 then postulated that the local group may contain an additional population of starless ( and gasless ) subhalos that are more massive than the observed low - mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "for simple  abundance - matching \" such massive subhalos are unexpected .",
    "however , they also noted that alternate dark - matter profiles would mitigate this conjecture .",
    "our figure  [ fig : tbtf ] ( left panel ) shows that for flat - core burkert profiles the mass discrepancy disappears .",
    "for flat - core profiles all of the simulated halos are within the observed strigari mass range , and an extra population of dark massive subhalos is not necessary .",
    "flat cores could be produced by self - interacting dark - matter ( @xcite ) and as noted by these authors , the resulting lowered densities in the cores reduce the mass - discrepancy .",
    "we have shown that the characteristic mass is obtained naturally and the mass discrepancy is resolved if a flat - core profile is adopted independent of its origin , so long as the cosmological relation between  and  is retained .",
    "however , the number of predicted subhalos at any given  is still larger than observed .",
    "we argue that some of these missing galaxies may be observable as the uchvcs , as suggested by g10 and a13 .",
    "our use of the burkert profile is thus motivated by ( a ) observational evidence for flat dm cores in dwarf galaxies , ( b ) the fact that such profiles naturally provide the strigari mass ( equation  [ [ eq : m300max1 ] ] ) for close to median halos , and ( c ) resolution of the mass discrepancy between simulated subhalos and observed dwarf galaxy masses .",
    "we adopt the flat - cored profiles in our modeling of the gas distributions in leo  t and the uchvcs , as described in   [ sec_models_gas ] and   [ sec_analysis ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      although the halo scale velocity is not well constrained by the hi half - mass radius , a lower limit can be set by the requirement that the wnm plus wim gas mass be bound to the halo .",
    "we apply two criteria for this .",
    "first , we require that the ratio of the potential to thermal energies per particle ( smw02  eq .  [ 34 ] ) , be larger than unity everywhere in the cloud , including in the outer wim layers .",
    "second , we require that the mean density ,  @xmath104 , ( including electrons and he ) must be larger than the critical density , @xmath105 where  is the external bounding pressure",
    ". this follows from the virial theorem for the gas , which may be written as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the thermal energy , @xmath108 is the surface pressure energy and @xmath109 is the gravitational energy . for a bound system ,",
    "the total energy is negative , and @xmath110 . inserting @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    ", we obtain our condition for a bound cloud @xmath113 both of our criteria that the wnm+wim gas be bound require @xmath114 .",
    "alternatively , the scale velocity for leo  t may be estimated by a luminosity - to - mass abundance matching argument .",
    "for example , @xcite finds that for dwarf galaxies @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the virial mass prior to accretion . for leo  t , @xmath117 , giving @xmath118 .",
    "given the @xcite relation between  and  for unstripped subhalos ( see equation [ [ eq : rmax_corr2 ] ] ) , and assuming that  is not altered significantly during the accretion process , this virial mass corresponds to a median halo with = 33  .",
    "we now turn to the uchvcs , which we wish to model as possible low - mass , gas - rich dwarf galaxies similar to leo  t , at local group distances . as we have just shown for leo  t , the projected hi half - mass ( i.e.  half - flux ) radius",
    "may then be used to constrain the dark - matter halo parameters .",
    "however , the uchvc galaxy candidates are only barely ( or not at all ) resolved by the arecibo beam .",
    "we are thus motivated to construct models for the uchvcs based on their total 21  cm fluxes as reported in the a13 uchvc catalog , to predict the projected half - mass radii and angular sizes for a range of assumed distances , as a guide to interpreting future high - resolution observations .      in calculating the hi half - mass radii for the uchvcs we proceed as follows .",
    "for any observed total 21  cm flux , we convert to hi mass given an assumed distance @xmath48 .",
    ", where @xmath119 is the integrated 21  cm flux ( jy  ) ] we consider unstripped burkert subhalo potentials with  between -1 and 1 , and  from 20 to 40  km  s@xmath120 .",
    "for each potential we find the total gas mass ( including the outer ionized component ) that reproduces the given hi mass , and we compute the hydrostatic gas density profile . given the profile we extract the hi ( projected ) half - mass physical and angular radii as functions of the assumed distance .",

    "our results for ( @xmath48 ) , and ( @xmath48 ) are displayed in figure [ fig : rel ] .",
    "we consider distances from 300  kpc to 2  mpc . the resulting half - mass radii range from 0.15 to 0.45  kpc , corresponding to angular half - mass sizes from 0.4 to 3 arcminutes .",

    "the analytic gas distribution ( footnote 5 ) , and the numerically computed hi gas distribution within the neutral cores , have the remarkable property that @xmath152 is almost identical to @xmath153 up to @xmath154 . here",

    "this compensates for the reduction in the expected small-@xmath132-gaussian sizes that are proportional to /.",
    "thus , for a given distance , the only way to alter the cloud sizes significantly is to change the scale radius  by varying  rather than by varying .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : prof2 ] in which we plot @xmath148 and 40  km  s@xmath120 profiles for = -1 and + 1 halos ( for @xmath149  mpc ) .",

    "the neutral core truncation points occur at larger radii for any distance , and the cloud sizes are increased as shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : rel ] . for any flux ,",

    "we recover consistent 300  and  if we solve for just the hi half - mass radius ( which for leo  t is 0.17  kpc ) . in this procedure",
    "we again set the total hi mass and temperature to the observed values , and adjust the halo parameters to match the observed half - mass radius .",
    "our detailed fits for leo  t show that the projected hi half - mass radius may be used reliably to constrain the halo parameters .",
    "the recent discovery that the uchvc hi102145.0/leo  p is a dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ) , in addition to our minihalo fits for the hi gas profile in leo  t , suggest that at least some of the uchvcs discovered in the alfalfa survey may in fact be gas rich but optically very faint dwarf galaxies , also in the local group .",
    "the orginal smw02 study focused on the much larger chvcs ( diameters @xmath204 ) .",
    "modeling the chvcs as median - stripped - minihalos , the implied distances are @xmath205  kpc ( as concluded by smw02 ) but it now seems less likely that at such distances they could retain their gas , as indicated by the nearby gasless sloan dwarfs .",
    "the uchvcs are smaller and hence could be much more distant .",
    "thus they are more plausible dwarf galaxy candidates .    for the uchvcs (   [ analysis_uchvc ] ) we calculate and plot ( figure [ fig : rel ] ) predicted half - mass hi radii ( physical and angular ) for assumed distances between 0.3 and 2 mpc , for 21  cm fluxes between 0.6 to 1.8  jy  , as observed in the more compact objects in the a13 uchvc catalog .",
    "we consider unstripped subhalos within @xmath206 of the cosmological median , with scale velocities  from 20 to 40 .",
    "we find that the cloud sizes depend mainly on @xmath207 and only weakly on .",
    "for a typical uchvc with a 21  cm flux equal to 0.9  jy  embedded in a median ( = 0 ) unstripped subhalo , we predict physical hi half - mass radii of 0.18 to 0.35 kpc ( or angular sizes of 0.6 to 2.1 arcmin ) for this distance range .",
    "if the angular half - flux radii of the uchvcs are measured , our predictions can be used to estimate the ( currently unknown ) distances to these objects . alternatively",
    ", if the distances to the uchvcs are measured by some other method , future high - resolution observations of the hi sizes will be useful in constraining the halo parameters , as we have done for leo  t.    the _ via  lactea  ii _ simulations ( @xcite ) indicate that there are @xmath208 halos with  between 15 and 50  at distances between 300  kpc and 1  mpc from a mw - sized galaxy .",
    "this suggests that if only a fraction ( 10 - 20% ) of the uchvcs are indeed dwarf galaxies , and assuming that the alfalfa survey - area is representative of the rest of the sky , these objects could resolve the missing satellite problem for this mass range .    to summarize our conclusions and predictions : first , we predict that searches for stars in the most compact uchvcs in the a13 catalog and in other surveys will show that some of these objects are optically faint , gas - rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "second , high - resolution ( sub - arcmin ) hi mapping observations of such gas - rich uchvc / dwarfs will show that they obey the size - versus - distance relations as given by our equations and . for a local group distance of 1  mpc , our predicted characteristic projected hi half - mass radius is @xmath34 for @xmath37  k wnm in a median unstripped subhalo obeying the  versus  relations found in simulations .",
    "third , based on our analysis of the resolved hi gas distribution in leo  t we conclude that at a distance of @xmath209  kpc from the galaxy the thermal pressure of any ambient hot coronal or igm gas is less than @xmath210  k , implying a hot gas mass of less than @xmath211  within this radius .",
    "fourth , we predict that at distances beyond the virial radii ( unstripped ) dwarf galaxies around the milky way and andromeda will have characteristic inner masses 300  of @xmath212  ( but with scatter ) , and lower by a factor @xmath213  compared to the nearby ( stripped ) sloan dwarfs .",
    "fifth , we predict that as ever lower - luminosity dwarf galaxies are observed within the virial radius , 300  will remain invariant , since in our picture the characteristic mass does not reflect a star - formation threshold , but rather the independence of 300  on subhalo mass for flat - core dm profiles , from scale velocities of 50  down to @xmath214  .    we have focused on flat - cored subhalos in this paper because ( a ) they are observed in at least some low - mass galaxies , ( b ) they naturally give rise to the observed common mass scale , and ( c ) because flat - cores resolve the mass - discrepancy problem found in dm - only simulations of local group structure growth .",
    "@xcite show that stellar feedback processes combined with tidal stripping can flatten cores with initially diverging nfw density distributions .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite suggest that self - interacting - dark - matter ( sidm ) may also produce flat - core dm profiles on small scales but leave the halos unaffected on larger scales .",
    "we suggest that optically - faint but gas - rich dwarf galaxies - perhaps uchvcs as dwarf galaxies - may be the best objects to study to distinguish between these theoretical options , since feedback effects in these almost starless systems are expected to be of minor importance to the evolution of their dm halos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , existence of flat dm cores in uchvcs ( or in leo  t and leo  p ) , if proved , may be intrinsic and evidence for sidm .",
    "sensitive high resolution 21  cm observations of the most compact uchvcs , as well as searches for stars and stellar features in these objects , would be worthwhile .",
