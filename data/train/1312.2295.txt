    "the phase transitions and phase diagram of qcd have been attracting great attentions from experimental and theoretical physicists in recent years  @xcite . based on present knowledge",
    ", a chiral symmetry restoration phase transition and a deconfinement phase transition can be defined in the vanishing quark mass limit and infinite quark mass limit respectively @xcite . while at physical mass , the natures of these phase transitions are under exploration .",
    "the first principle , lattice qcd calculations indicate that the temperature driven phase transition at vanishing chemical potential is a crossover @xcite .",
    "although no conclusive results from lattice qcd are obtained at higher chemical potential ( of the order of temperature ) due to the sign problem , not only many effective model calculations  @xcite but also the dyson - schwinger equation approach of continuum qcd  @xcite have shown that there is a chemical potential driven first order phase transition at low temperature and , as the temperature goes higher , the strength of the first order transition decreases and finally becomes a crossover at and beyond the critical end point ( cep ) .",
    "interesting behavior of first order phase transition is the phase coexistence .",
    "when first order phase transition takes place , the system is inhomogeneous and two phases with different particle numbers , energy and entropy densities meet each other at an interface .",
    "the formation of this inhomogeneity is guided by a slow nucleation or an explosive spinodal decomposition  @xcite which may lead to observable effects in colliding experiment .",
    "although the real case encountered in future low energy collisions at rhic and fair  @xcite depends on the detail of the phase evolution trajectory on the phase diagram , such as the time duration in the spinodal decomposition region  @xcite , interface tension remains a key quantity in either of the two transition mechanisms . in astrophysics aspect , which is another important qcd test - ground ,",
    "it is also discovered that a small value of interface tension in qcd matter favours the nucleation of quark matter during the early post - bounce stage of core collapse supernovae , allowing observable astrophysical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the interface effects are usually taken into account thermodynamically by interface tension and related quantities such as interface entropy and critical size of the bubble . though restricted by sign problem at large chemical potential , lattice qcd has tried to calculate the interface tension  @xcite .",
    "besides , many effective model calculations have been performed to investigate interface effects  @xcite , especially in the process of hadronization . the phenomenological method of extracting the interface tension from the equation of states ( eos ) of the system is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite by adding density gradient term to the energy density .",
    "the interface tension calculated in @xmath0-flavour and @xmath1 flavour njl model and linear sigma model has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the latter also discuss the variation behavior of the critical bubble size with respect to quark chemical potential .",
    "these effective models give really low values of interface tension ( from 5 to 30 @xmath2 ) at low temperature which favours nucleation process .",
    "however , more recent @xmath1 flavour njl model calculation  @xcite gave a very large value ( @xmath3 ) when considering the finite size effect .",
    "it is then imperative to revisit the interface tension problem with the njl model .",
    "once the temperature dependence of interface tension is obtained , the associated entropy can be calculated straightforwardly by maxwell relation . even though the entropy of the quark and gluon system has been studied quite well ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , interface entropy has not yet been extensively discussed .",
    "previous calculations showed that the entropy of the system does not increase with the decreasing of temperature and chemical potential .",
    "one usually regards the system to consist of either quarks and gluons , hadrons , or their mixture . according to the increasing entropy principle",
    ", the hadronization can not take place when lowering the temperature of the quark system .",
    "then the entropy puzzle  @xcite arises for the hadronization process .",
    "in fact , interfaces emerge to form the quark droplets ( the embryos of the hadrons ) .",
    "such an interface production induces interface entropy which may contribute to that of the final hadron matter and strongly changes the entropy discontinuity scales and even its order of the two phases in the first order phase transitions . therefore ,",
    "considering the interface effect may shed light on clarifying the entropy puzzle  @xcite .",
    "it has been known that a quantity concerned with interface entropy production is the typical length scale characterizing the inhomogeneity of the system or how much interface is present in unit volume .",
    "such a problem has been discussed with the thin - wall approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , the thin - wall approximation may not be well justified at low temperatures and may overestimate the critical bubble size . then , it is also beneficial to compare the thin - wall results with those from the improved method  @xcite and assess the influence of this change to the first order phase transition .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the interface tension , the critical bubble size and the entropy density by 2 + 1 flavour nambu - jona - lasino ( njl ) model .",
    "it is found that the interface modification to the entropy density is important in mid - low temperature region .",
    "it shows that the thin - wall approximation overestimate the critical bubble size at low temperature .",
    "furthermore , the value order of the entropies of the two phases in the hadronization process may be reversed so that the entropy puzzle can be solved if one improves the thin - wall approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . following this introduction , we describe briefly the njl model for the three flavour quark system in section ii , and give detailed description of the obtained phase diagram in section iii . in section iv and v",
    "we describe the interface thermodynamics and methods to extract the interface tension from eos , respectively . the numerical results and discussion of the interface entropy and critical bubble radius",

    "the difference in mass between @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark is neglected here , so the isospin symmetry is preserved .",
    "the flavour @xmath10 symmetry is broken explicitly by a larger strange quark mass , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "the term @xmath12 serves as the lagrangian multiplets for the conservation of quark number of each flavour , taking into account their dependence on finite chemical potential .",
    "the chemical potentials for different quarks are set to be equal to each other for simplicity . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the strength of the four - fermion interaction and the six - fermion interaction , respectively .",
    "the @xmath15 in the four - fermion term are the eight gell - mann matrices and @xmath16 .",

    "the equilibrium condition requires @xmath25 by solving these equations , the chiral condensation can be determined self - consistently . then , the grand potential is obtained by substituting the equilibrium values of condensations in the expression @xmath26 . because the difference between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark current masses",
    "is neglected , it follows that the @xmath8-quark and @xmath9-quark condensations are identical and the three equations reduce to two .",
    "these coupled nonlinear equations have more than one set of solutions and one can study the phase transition by analyzing the evolution of the solutions .",
    "we have solved the coupled equations of the three flavour quark njl model with the commonly adopted parameters ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 )  @xcite and the homotopy method  @xcite to get all the solutions in the coexistence region .",

    "we see evidently from the figures that , at lower chemical potential , the nambu phase ( dcsb phase ) , is the only possible homogeneous state of the system . at higher chemical potential , only the dynamical chiral symmetry restored wigner phase ( dcs phase ) is allowed . in the intermediate region",
    "where a chemical potential driven first order phase transition emerges , the condensations of all quarks are multi - valued .",

    "the figure shows apparently that the coexistence region ( multi - values region ) shrinks rapidly with the increasing of temperature and vanishes when the cep temperature is reached .",
    "one can also notice that , when the chemical potential is below a certain value , the nambu ( dcsb ) phase is the stable one since it corresponds to the global minimum while the wigner ( dcs ) phase is metastable ; in case of above the certain chemical potential , the wigner phase gets stable and the nambu phase becomes metastable .",
    "it is clearly from fig  [ grand - potential ] , that the second order derivative of @xmath33 with respect to chemical potential is negative for nambu and wigner phases but positive for intermediate phase . as a result , nambu and",
    "wigner phases are stable against tiny disturbance in chemical potential while the intermediate phase is always unstable to such fluctuations .",
    "although this argument precludes the existence of a homogeneous intermediate phase , this branch of solution is important in inhomogeneous system and can induce the appearance of the interface effect  @xcite and , in turn , the phase transitions .    with the above results , one can fix the boundary of the coexistence line in the @xmath34@xmath35 plane . for completeness",
    "we have also calculated the crossover boundary by finding the temperatures that maximize the chiral susceptibility @xmath36 at each chemical potential , where @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 a detailed description of this chiral susceptibility can be found in ref .",

    "it is interesting that the chiral phase transition may take place on different coexistence lines when the system travels in different processes across the coexistence region ( the reasons will be discussed in section iv ) .",
    "when the system travels from dcsb phase to dcs phase , the phase transition takes place at higher baryon density and with larger coexistence region ; while it coexists with the opposite process in intermediate density region .",
    "a curved interface is generated in both of these cases .",
    "if the boundary of the two phases is set to be planar , it coincides with that given ( traditionally ) by the condition @xmath46 .    the phase diagram can also be converted to the relation between the energy density and the baryon density ( also referred to as the equation of state , eos ) in which the energy density reads @xmath47 where the @xmath30 is the entropy density .",

    "this is definitely not reasonable .",
    "furthermore , the crossover boundary on the @xmath35@xmath49 plane is multi - valued , which is also different from the conjectured phase diagram in ref .",
    "these two problems are also encountered in other work based on 2 + 1 flavour njl model under different treatment  @xcite .",
    "we would attribute them to the absence of confinement effect in the model , but there may also be other aspects .",
    "the above scheme and results capacite only for uniform bulk matters . in first order phase transition ,",
    "spatial density inhomogeneity is in fact , significant to understand properties of the mixed phase .",
    "the inhomogeneity leads to an interface tension that not only determines the critical bubble size , but also contributes extra entropy to the system during the nucleation process ( in detail , the  vaporization \" or deconfinement when being heated and/or compressed , and the  coagulation \" or hadronization when being cooled and/or diluted ) .",
    "when the system is compressed continuously , interfaces finally collide with each other and the inhomogeneity disappears at the end of phase transition .",
    "interface entropy and associated latent heat are released .",
    "however , in the nucleation process , which is also the focus of the present work , the system expands continuously . as a result , interfaces survive as the boundary of the finite size hadron and there is a net interface contribution to the entropy of the final state .",
    "we begin our discussion with the thermodynamics of interface .",

    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 are the interface tension , interface area , respectively . using the maxwell relation and the extensity of entropy , we arrive at the interface entropy @xmath59 where @xmath60 being interface entropy density , is the opposite of the partial derivative of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "the total entropy density of the system can be gained by summarizing the body entropy density and the interface entropy density .",
    "a straightforward result is @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath58 are the volume of the system and the total area of interfaces within the system .",
    "the problem is then that a reasonable determination of the ratio @xmath63 depends on the dynamics of the interface generation , which is too complicated to be addressed completely and fundamentally in the present work .",
    "however , it is intuitively to assume that the total area of the interfaces , @xmath58 , depends on how many bubbles are generated in the system after the phase transition .",
    "assuming that the system is divided by lattice in which spherical bubbles are formed , we have then @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the average of the radius of the bubbles . if the system enters the spinodal region , another possible way to overcome this difficulty is to treat @xmath63 as the typical length scale of the spinodal decomposition .",
    "it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gradient term modified dispersion relation for the density fluctuation is of the form @xmath66 in the spinodal decomposition region , @xmath67 is negative and the infinitesimal density fluctuation grows exponentially with time .",
    "due to the presence of the @xmath68 term , the growth of fluctuation of a typical wave number exceeds those of other modes and dominates the decomposition process .",
    "we can take the inverse of the wave length of this mode as an evaluation of @xmath63 .",

    "<S> we study the qcd phases and their transitions in 2 + 1 flavour njl model , with focus on the interface effects such as the interface tension , the interface entropy and critical bubble size in the coexistence region of the first order phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , under the thin - wall approximation , interface contribution to total entropy density changes its discontinuity scale in the first order phase transition . however , the entropy density of dynamical chiral symmetry ( dcs ) phase is always greater than that of the dynamical chiral symmetry broken ( dcsb ) phase in both heating and hadronization processes . to address this entropy puzzle , </S>",
    "<S> the thin - wall approximation is evaluated in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the puzzle can be attributed to a drastic overestimate of the critical bubble size at low temperature in the hadronization process . with an improvement on the thin - wall approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the entropy puzzle is well solved with the total entropy density of the hadron - dcsb phase exceeding apparently that of the dcs - quark phase at low temperature . </S>"
