    "the nuclear force has been at the heart of nuclear physics ever since the field was born in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron by chadwick  @xcite . in fact , during the first few decades of nuclear physics , the term ` nuclear forces ' was often used as synonymous for nuclear physics as a whole  @xcite .",
    "there are good reasons why the nuclear force plays such an outstanding role .",
    "the interaction between two nucleons is basic for all of nuclear physics .",
    "the traditional goal of nuclear physics is to understand the properties of atomic nuclei in terms of the ` bare ' interaction between pairs of nucleons . with the onset of quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "it became clear that the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is not fundamental .",
    "nevertheless , even today , in any first approach towards a nuclear structure problem , one assumes the nucleons to be elementary particles .",
    "the failure or success of this approach may then teach us something about the relevance of subnuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "the nn interaction has been investigated by a large number of physicists all over the world for the past 70 years .",
    "it is the empirically best known piece of strong interactions ; in fact , for no other sample of the strong force a comparable amount of experimental data has been accumulated .",
    "the oldest attempt to explain the nature of the nuclear force is due to yukawa  @xcite . according to his theory ,",
    "massive bosons ( mesons ) mediate the interaction between two nucleons .",
    "this idea spawned the sister discipline of particle physics .",
    "although , in the light of qcd , meson theory is not perceived as fundamental anymore , the meson exchange concept continues to represent the best working model for a quantitative nucleon - nucleon potential .    historically , it turned out to be a formidable task to describe the nuclear force just phenomenologically , and it took a quarter century to come up with the first semi - quantitative model  @xcite  in 1957 .",
    "ever since , there has been substantial progress in experiment and theory of the nuclear force .",
    "most basic questions were settled in the 1960 s and 70 s such that in recent years we could concentrate on the subtleties of this peculiar force .    in this topical review , we will report the chief progress of the past decade",
    ". the focus will be on the low - energy region ( below pion production threshold ) .",
    "summaries of earlier periods and a pedagogical introduction into the field can be found in references  @xcite . in the 1990 s ,",
    "major issues concerning the nn interaction have been :    * charge - dependence , * the precise value of the @xmath0 coupling constant , * improved phase shift analysis , * high - precision nn data , * high - precision nn potentials , * qcd and the nuclear force , * nn scattering at intermediate and high energies .",
    "we will now review these topics one by one .",
    "by definition , _ charge independence _ is invariance under any rotation in isospin space",
    ". a violation of this symmetry is referred to as charge dependence or charge independence breaking ( cib ) .",
    "_ charge symmetry _ is invariance under a rotation by 180@xmath1 about the @xmath2-axis in isospin space if the positive @xmath3-direction is associated with the positive charge .",
    "the violation of this symmetry is known as charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) .",
    "obviously , csb is a special case of charge dependence .",
    "cib of the strong nn interaction means that , in the isospin @xmath4 state , the proton - proton ( @xmath5 ) , neutron - proton ( @xmath6 ) , or neutron - neutron ( @xmath7 ) interactions are ( slightly ) different , after electromagnetic effects have been removed .",
    "csb of the nn interaction refers to a difference between proton - proton ( @xmath8 ) and neutron - neutron ( @xmath9 ) interactions , only .",
    "the charge dependence of the nn interaction is subtle , but in the @xmath10 state it is well established .",
    "the observation of small charge - dependent effects in this state is possible because the scattering length of an almost bound state acts like a powerful magnifying glass on the interaction .",
    "the current understanding is that  on a fundamental level  the charge dependence of nuclear forces is due to a difference between the up and down quark masses and electromagnetic interactions among the quarks .",
    "a consequence of this are mass differences between hadrons of the same isospin multiplet and meson mixing .",
    "therefore , if cib is calculated based upon hadronic models , the mass differences between hadrons of the same isospin multiplet , meson mixing , and irreducible meson - photon exchanges are considered as major causes . for reviews on charge dependence , see references  @xcite .",
    "we will now summarize recent developments ( that are not contained in any of these reviews ) .",
    "as discussed , the scattering lengths in the @xmath10 state for @xmath8 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 scattering ( denoted by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively ) are the best evidence for the charge - dependence of nuclear forces . while we have well - established values for @xmath12 and @xmath13 since many decades , the neutron - neutron scattering length continues to be a tough problem .",
    "the basic reason for this is that , so far , we have not been able to conduct any direct measurements of @xmath14 using free neutron - neutron collisions  @xcite .",
    "all current values are extracted from multi - particle reactions the analyses of which are beset with large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the processes that are believed to have the smallest uncertainties are @xmath15 while , there are no data on the first reaction , the other two processes have been studied repeatedly . in 1998 , a very carefull study of the @xmath16 induced reaction was published  @xcite and , in 1999 , a renewed thorough investigation of the neutron induced process was accomplished  @xcite , yielding results that are in perfect agreement , namely , @xmath17 which can be summarised by @xmath18 correcting for the neutron - neutron magnetic interaction , the pure nuclear value is : @xmath19 this summarizes the status by the end of 1999 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the happy end of the story that everybody had hoped for . to properly discuss the new ( and old ) problems",
    ", we will first provide more details concerning the two types of reactions for which experiments have been conducted .    over the past 20 years , there have been three independent studies of the reaction @xmath20 . in one case  @xcite , only the @xmath21 spectrum was measured , while in the other two cases  @xcite , kinematically complete experiments were performed measuring the @xmath21 and a neutron in the final state .",
    "the results are : @xmath22 owing to the high spatial resolution of the gamma ray detector in reference  @xcite , it was possible to assess the systematic errors due to uncertainties in the modelling of the stopped pion distribution in the target and in target vertex reconstruction in the monte carlo simulation",
    ". therefore , the systematic uncertainties of the kinematically complete studies are now much better understood , and a very high statistical accuracy in reference  @xcite makes the experimental uncertainty comparable to the theoretical one in the extraction of @xmath14 from the reaction d@xmath23 . the combined result from all three studies gives the new world average for the d@xmath24 reaction @xmath25 in summary , the reaction @xmath26 appears to be in good shape .",
    "unfortunately , we can not say the same about the neutron - induced deuteron breakup process . until the recent investigation by the tunl group , gonzalez - trotter _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , all studies of the reaction @xmath27 gave for @xmath14 values that differed from that obtained from the d@xmath23 process . theoretical uncertainties in extracting @xmath14 from the neutron - induced deuteron breakup are much larger , as we will explain now .",
    "first , in reactions with more than two nucleons in the final state , three nucleon forces ( 3nf ) modify the cross section .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite that the 3nf is the reason why @xmath14 extracted from the d@xmath28 process differs from that obtained from the d@xmath23 reaction .",
    "the 3nf are a natural consequence of strong interactions .",
    "therefore , 3nf do exist , but the question is how significant they are and , in particular , do they affect a specific configuration of the @xmath29 breakup wherefrom one extracts @xmath14 .",
    "there are several indications for possible 3nf effects in nuclear physics : @xmath30h binding energy , nuclear matter binding energy , @xmath31he binding energy and negative parity excited states , @xmath30he and @xmath31he one - body density distributions , binding energies and radii of some nuclei , @xmath32o magnetic moment form factor , @xmath29 capture , @xmath33 in elastic @xmath29 scattering , and space star , final state interaction ( fsi ) and quasifree scattering ( qfs ) configurations in the @xmath29 breakup  @xcite ; but none of them provided conclusive information on 3nf .",
    "it was possible to reconcile all values of @xmath14 extracted from the studies of the reaction d@xmath28 in the energy domain of 10 to 50 mev with those obtained from the d@xmath23 process using the fujita - miyazawa 3nf  @xcite .",
    "however , the reanalyses of these @xmath29 breakup processes  @xcite gave values that differed considerably from those quoted by the original authors .",
    "though any reanalysis is clouded by the lack of all relevant information , the main reason is the fact that original analyses used simple @xmath34-wave separable nn potentials , while the re - analyses were done using the rigorous three body theory of glckle _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the claimed theoretical uncertainties in the original papers were underestimated .",
    "second , the magnetic interaction modifies the value of the @xmath10 scattering length extracted from the neutron induced deuteron breakup .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that for the neutron - pickup configuration in the neutron - induced deuteron breakup leading to the @xmath9 fsi there is a magnetic interaction in the @xmath10 state which is repulsive thereby decreasing the absolute value of @xmath14 .",
    "depending on the nn potential ( hard core or soft core ) , impulse approximation estimates of the effect of the magnetic interaction in the pickup configuration changes @xmath14 from @xmath35 fm to @xmath36 or even @xmath37 fm  @xcite .",
    "the correction for the knockout configuration has the opposite sign since it is dominated by the magnetic interaction between a neutron and a proton in the @xmath10 state .",
    "the situation is more complex for the neutron - proton fsi , since the @xmath11 fsi occurs in the @xmath10 and @xmath38 states .",
    "the determination of @xmath14 by gonzales - trotter _ et al _",
    "@xcite has two characteristic features : first , it uses the rigorous theory  @xcite including , in addition to several realistic nn potentials , also the tucson - melbourne 3nf , and second , it performs a high - accuracy comparison of neutron - neutron and neutron - proton fsi in the @xmath10 state by measuring cross sections of the reaction d@xmath28 for identical kinematic conditions ( the angle of the two emitted nucleons interacting in the @xmath10 final state is 28 to 43 deg ) at the incident neutron energy of 13 mev .",
    "therefore , the neutron - proton scattering length , @xmath13 , becomes the standard for determining @xmath14 . by comparing the extracted value for @xmath13 and its uncertainty , it was possible to set an upper limit of 0.2 @xmath39 0.6 fm on any possible effects due to 3nf influencing the extracted value of @xmath14",
    "of course , it is possible that the effect of the magnetic interaction discussed by slobodrian _ et al",
    "_  @xcite are negligible in the energy / angular region studied by gonzalez - trotter _ et al _  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it should be stressed that the rigorous calculations by glckle _ et al _  @xcite do not include the electromagnetic interaction , and that there are now many indications of the shortcomings of the tucson - melbourne 3nf .    in the year of 2000 , a new study of the neutron - neutron fsi in the d@xmath28 reaction at the incident neutron energy of 25.3 mev was published by the neutron group at bonn  @xcite .",
    "the data were analyzed using the rigorous theory  @xcite .",
    "the extracted value is , @xmath40 which is in drastic disagreement with the result of the tunl group  @xcite published in 1999 and also with those obtained from the d@xmath23 process .",
    "while most of the previous kinematically complete studies of the reaction d@xmath28 employ a thick , active deuterated target measuring the energy of the proton , and detecting two neutrons at nearly the same angle on the same side of the incident neutron , this recent measurement  @xcite uses a thin deuterium target and detects a neutron at @xmath41 deg and a proton at @xmath42 deg .",
    "the advantage of this geometry is the reduction of the strong cross talk between neutron detectors and the reduction in losses from neutron multiple scattering .",
    "this geometrical configuration has the added advantage that the locus contains @xmath11 qfs besides @xmath9 fsi and , therefore , provides a built - in normalization .",
    "indeed , normalizing the data to @xmath11 qfs yields a very similar value : @xmath43 neither the use of different nn potentials nor the inclusion of the tucson - melbourne 3nf in the rigorous calculation produces noticeably different results for @xmath14 .",
    "this geometry at this incident energy is the region where the 3nf effect of the tucson - melbourne potential is very small .",
    "the preliminary result by the bonn group  using the same incident energy of 25.3 mev  gave a good fit to the @xmath11 fsi spectrum using @xmath44 fm .",
    "the disagreement between the two most recent studies , gonzalez - trotter _ et al _ ( tunl )  @xcite and huhn _ et al _ ( bonn )  @xcite , opens again the problem of how completely do we understand the interactions involved in the three nucleon problem , specifically the 3nf .",
    "it also suggests that additional experimental studies at different incident energies and at different angles might be useful in resolving the problem .",
    "when we use for @xmath14 the value obtained from the d@xmath24 studies [ equation  ( [ eq_annav ] ) ] , correct it for the magnetic moment interaction [ equation  ( [ eq_ann ] ) ] , and compare it to the corresponding @xmath8 value  @xcite : @xmath45 then charge - symmetry is broken by the following amount , @xmath46 recommended values for the corresponding effective ranges are  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath47 implying @xmath48    traditionally , it was believed that the meson mixing explains essentially all csb effects .",
    "the largest contribution came from @xmath49 mixing , and there was very meager knowledge of @xmath50 mixing . recently",
    ", csb was studied by the comparison of two charge - symmetric processes : d@xmath51 and d@xmath52 in the energy region of the @xmath53 threshold .",
    "the result for the ratio of the two processes in this energy region is @xmath54 , after a phase space correction is made for the difference in the threshold energies of the two reactions  @xcite .",
    "the deviation of @xmath55 from 1 is an indication of csb which is mostly due to @xmath50 mixing .",
    "a phenomenological fully relativistic model , which is based on coupled channel n@xmath56n@xmath53 amplitudes , takes into account different @xmath9 and @xmath8 fsi and explicitly includes @xmath50 mixing , was developed  @xcite and compared to the data yielding for the @xmath50 mixing angle the value of @xmath57 deg , consistent with the mixing angle determined from particle decays and isospin - forbidden processes as well as with several other theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the masses of neutron and proton represents the most basic cause for csb of the nuclear force . therefore , it is important to have a very thorough accounting of this effect .",
    "the most trivial consequence of nucleon mass splitting is a difference in the kinetic energies : for the heavier neutrons , the kinetic energy is smaller than for protons .",
    "this raises the magnitude of the @xmath9 scattering length by 0.25 fm as compared to @xmath8 .",
    "besides the above , nucleon mass splitting has an impact on all meson - exchange diagrams that contribute to the nuclear force . in 1998 ,",
    "the most comprehensive and thorough calculation of these csb effects ever conducted has been published  @xcite .",
    "the investigation is based upon the bonn full model for the nn interaction  @xcite . here",
    ", we will summarize the results .",
    "for this we devide the total number of meson exchange diagrams that is involved in the nuclear force into several classes .",

    "part ( a ) of figure  2 applies to @xmath8 scattering , while part ( b ) refers to @xmath9 scattering . when charged - pion exchange is involved , the intermediate - state nucleon differs from that of the external legs .",
    "this is one of the sources for csb from this group of diagrams .",

    "the effect is typically opposite to the one from @xmath58 exchange .",
    "further @xmath77 and @xmath78 contributions * ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the bonn potential also includes some @xmath77-exchanges that can be approximated in terms of @xmath79 diagrams and @xmath78-exchanges of @xmath80 type .",
    "the sum of the two groups is small , indicating convergence of the diagramatic expansion .",
    "the csb effect from this class is essentially negligible .",
    "the total csb difference of the singlet scattering length caused by nucleon mass splitting amounts to 1.58 fm ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab_csb ] ) which agrees well with the empirical value @xmath62 fm .",
    "thus , nucleon mass splitting alone can explain the entire empirical csb of the singlet scattering length  @xcite .",
    "_ this is a remarkable result .",
    "_    the impact of the various classes of diagrams on csb phase shift differences are shown in figure  [ fig_csb3 ] .",

    "the csb effect on the phase shifts of higher partial waves is small ; in @xmath81 and @xmath82 waves , typically in the order of 0.1 deg at 300 mev and less at lower energies .",
    "this fact may suggest that csb in partial waves other than @xmath83 may be of no relevance . in references  @xcite",
    "it was shown that this is not true : csb beyond the @xmath34 waves is crucial for the explanation of the nolen - schiffer anomaly .    before finishing this subsection",
    ", a word is in place concerning other mechanisms that cause csb of the nuclear force .",
    "traditionally , it was believed that @xmath84 mixing explains essentially all csb in the nuclear force  @xcite .",
    "however , recently some doubt has been cast on this paradigm .",
    "some researchers  @xcite found that @xmath84 exchange may have a substantial @xmath85 dependence such as to cause this contribution to nearly vanish in nn .",
    "our finding that the empirically known csb in the nuclear force can be explained solely from nucleon mass splitting ( leaving essentially no room for additional csb contributions from @xmath84 mixing or other sources ) fits well into this scenario . on the other hand ,",

    "the issue is unresolved .",
    "good summaries of the controversial points of view can be found in references  @xcite .",
    "finally , for reasons of completeness , we mention that irreducible diagrams of @xmath56 and @xmath21 exchange between two nucleons create a charge - dependent nuclear force .",

    "moreover , the @xmath110-exchange in @xmath11 scattering carries a negative sign , which further weakens the @xmath11 ope potential .",

    ".  table  [ tab_cib ] ) .",
    "this has been know for a long time .",
    "+ due to the small mass of the pion , ope is a sizable contribution in all partial waves including higher partial waves ; and due to the pion s relatively large mass splitting ( 3.4% ) , ope creates relatively large charge - dependent effects in all partial waves ( see dashed curve in figure  [ fig_cib3 ] ) .",
    "* @xmath58-exchange diagrams .",
    "* we now turn to the cib created by the @xmath58 exchange contribution to the nn interaction .",
    "there are many diagrams that contribute ( see reference  @xcite for a complete overview ) . for our qualitative discussion here , we pick the largest of all @xmath58 diagrams , namely , the box diagrams with @xmath75 intermediate states , figure  [ fig_cib2 ] .",
    "disregarding isospin factors and using some drastic approximation , the amplitude for such a diagram is @xmath112 ^ 2 } { ( m_{\\pi}^2+{\\bf k}^{2})^2(e_p+e^\\delta_p-2e_q ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times f^2_{\\pi nn } ( \\lambda_{\\pi nn},|{\\bf k}| ) \\ ; f^2_{\\pi n\\delta } ( \\lambda_{\\pi n\\delta},|{\\bf k}| ) \\ , , \\label{eq_2pi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 with * q * the relative momentum in the initial and final state ( for simplicity , we are considering a diagonal matrix element ) ; @xmath114 and @xmath115 with @xmath116 mev the @xmath72-isobar mass ; * s * is the spin transition operator between nucleon and @xmath72 . for the @xmath117 coupling constant , @xmath118 , the quark - model relationship @xmath119 is used  @xcite . + for small momentum transfers * k * , this attractive contribution is roughly proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "thus for the @xmath58 exchange , the heavier pions will provide less attraction than the lighter ones . charged and neutral pion exchanges occur for @xmath8 as well as for @xmath11 , and it is important to take the isospin factors carried by the various diagrams into account .",
    "they are given in figure  [ fig_cib2 ] below each diagram .",
    "for @xmath8 scattering , the diagram with double @xmath111 exchange carries the largest factor , while double @xmath111 exchange carries only a small relative weight in @xmath11 scattering .",

    "notice that this effect has always the same sign as the effect from ope ( dashed curve ) , but it is substantially smaller .",
    "the reason for the ope character of this contribution is that @xmath79 prevails over @xmath80 and , thus , determines the character of this contribution .",
    "since sigma - exchange is negative and since , futhermore , the propagator in between the @xmath56 and the @xmath121 exchange is also negative , the overall sign of the @xmath79 exchange is the same as ope .",

    "assuming the @xmath107 of equations  ( [ eq_cdgpi1 ] ) and ( [ eq_cdgpi2 ] ) , one obtains the @xmath91 predictions given in the last column of table  [ tab_cibgpi ] .",

    ", it is a matter of fact that within the conventional phase shifts analysis , in which the lower partial waves are essentially unconstrained , a better fit can not be achieved .",
    "about two decades ago , the nijmegen group embarked on a program to substantially improve nn phase shift analysis . to achieve their goal ,",
    "the nijmegen group took two decisive measures  @xcite .",
    "first , they ` pruned ' the database ; i.e. , they scanned very critically the world nn database ( all data in the energy range 0 - 350 mev laboratory energy published in a regular physics journal between january 1955 and december 1992 ) and eliminated all data that had either an improbably high @xmath170 ( more than three standard deviations off ) or an improbably low @xmath170 ; of the 2078 world @xmath8 data below 350 mev 1787 survived the scan , and of the 3446 @xmath11 data 2514 survived .",
    "second , they introduced sophisticated , semi - phenomenological model assumptions into the analysis .",
    "namely , for each of the lower partial waves ( @xmath214 ) a different energy - dependent potential is adjusted to constrain the energy - dependent analysis .",
    "phase shifts are obtained using these potentials in a schroedinger equation . from these phase shifts the predictions for the observables",
    "are calculated including the @xmath170 for the fit of the experimental data .",
    "this @xmath170 is then minimized as a function of the parameters of the partial - wave potentials .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the nijmegen analysis is a _ potential analysis _ ; the final phase shifts are the ones predicted by the ` optimized ' partial - wave potentials .    in the nijmegen analysis ,",
    "each partial - wave potential consists of a short- and a long - range part , with the separation line at @xmath215 fm .",
    "the long - range potential @xmath216 ( @xmath217 fm ) is made up of an electromagnetic part @xmath218 and a nuclear part @xmath219 : @xmath220 the electromagnetic interaction can be written as @xmath221 for proton - proton scattering and @xmath222 for neutron - proton scattering , where @xmath223 denotes an improved coulomb potential ( which takes into account the lowest - order relativistic corrections to the static coulomb potential and includes contributions of all two - photon exchange diagrams ) ; @xmath224 is the vacuum polarization potential , and @xmath225 the magnetic moment interaction .",
    "the nuclear long - range potential @xmath219 consists of the local one - pion - exchange ( ope ) tail @xmath226 ( the coupling constant @xmath107 being one of the parameters used to minimize the @xmath170 ) multiplied by a factor @xmath227 and the tail of the heavy - boson - exchange ( hbe ) contributions of the nijmegen78 potential  @xcite @xmath228 , enhanced by a factor of 1.8 in singlet states ; i.  e. @xmath229 with @xmath230 and @xmath231 , where @xmath34 denotes the total spin of the two - nucleon system .",
    "the energy - dependent factor @xmath227 ( with @xmath232 , @xmath233 ) takes into account relativity in a ` minimal ' way , damping the nonrelativistic ope potential at higher energies .",
    "as indicated , @xmath226 depends on the @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath107 and the pion mass @xmath97 , which gives rise to charge dependence . for @xmath8 scattering , the ope potential is @xmath234 with @xmath235 the mass of the neutral pion . in @xmath11 scattering , we have to distinguish between @xmath4 and @xmath236 : @xmath237    the partial - wave short - range potentials ( @xmath238 fm ) are energy - dependent square - wells ( see figures  2 and 3 of reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the energy - dependence of the depth of the square - well is parametrized in terms of up to three parameters per partial wave . for the states with @xmath214",
    ", there are a total of 39 such parameters ( 21 for @xmath8 and 18 for @xmath11 ) plus the pion - nucleon coupling constants ( @xmath239 and @xmath240 ) .    in the nijmegen @xmath11 analysis ,",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath11 phase shifts are calculated from the corresponding @xmath8 phase shifts ( except in @xmath10 where an independent analysis is conducted ) by applying corrections due to electromagnetic effects and charge dependence of ope .",
    "thus , the @xmath11 analysis determines @xmath241 and the @xmath236 states , only .    in the combined nijmegen @xmath8 and @xmath11 analysis  @xcite , the fit for 1787 @xmath8 data and 2514 @xmath11 data below 350 mev , available in 1993 , results in the ` perfect ' @xmath213datum = 0.99 .",

    "what stands out in table  [ tab_chi2 ] are the rather large values for the @xmath170/datum generated by the nijmegen analysis and the argonne potential for the the after-1992 @xmath8 data , which are essentially the new iucf data .",

    "the conclusion from these two facts is that the new iucf data provide information that was not contained in the old database . or , in other words , the pre-1993 data were insufficient and still left too much lattitude for pinning down nn models .",

    "the large differences in the @xmath170 implies that there are inconsistencies in the data .",
    "since the psa and potentials of table  [ tab_npsig ] were fitted to a database that includes the bonner data but excludes the freiburg data , one might suspect that this could be the explanation of the good @xmath170 for the bonner data and the bad one for freiburg .",
    "arndt has investigated this question  @xcite and found that this is not entirely true .",
    "when he excludes the bonner data from the vpi / gwu analysis and uses the freiburg data instead , the latter can be reproduced with a @xmath170/datum @xmath258 ( the bonner data produce @xmath170/datum @xmath259 for this fit ) .",
    "thus , the freiburg data can not be reproduced with the same accuracy as the bonner data , even if one restricts the @xmath11 @xmath121 data exclusively to freiburg .",
    "this may be seen as an indication that there are inconsistencies within the freiburg data .",
    "certainly , the bonner data and the freiburg data are inconsistent with each other .",
    "similar problems are observed with the uppsala data , which are included in the vpi / gwu analysis and excluded from the nijmegen psa .",
    "the problems with the @xmath11 differential cross sections deserve further systematic investigation .",
    "in the 1990 s , a focus has been on the quantitative aspect of nn potentials .",
    "even the best nn models of the 1980 s  @xcite fit the nn data typically with a @xmath170/datum @xmath260 or more .",
    "this is still substantially above the perfect @xmath170/datum @xmath261 . to put microscopic nuclear structure theory to a reliable test , one needs a perfect nn potential such that discrepancies in the predictions can not be blamed on a bad fit of the nn data .    based upon the nijmegen analysis and the ( pruned ) nijmegen database , new charge - dependent nn potentials were constructed in the early / mid 1990 s .",
    "the groups involved and the names of their new creations are , in chronological order :    * nijmegen group  @xcite : nijm - i , nijm - ii , and reid93 potentials .",
    "* argonne group  @xcite : @xmath250 potential .",
    "* bonn group  @xcite : cd - bonn potential .",
    "all these potentials have in common that they use about 45 parameters and fit the ( pruned ) 1992 nijmegen data base with a @xmath170/datum @xmath261 .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous section , since 1992 the @xmath8 database has substantially expanded and for the current database the @xmath170/datum produced by some potentials is not so perfect anymore ( cf .  table  [ tab_chi2 ] ) .      concerning the theoretical basis of these potential",
    ", one could say that they are all  more or less  constructed ` in the spirit of meson theory ' ( e.g. , all potentials include the one - pion - exchange contribution ) .",
    "however , there are considerable differences in the details leading to considerable off - shell differences among the potentials .    to explain these details and differences in a systematic way , let us first sketch the general scheme for the derivation of a meson - theoretic potential .",
    "one starts from field - theoretic lagrangians for meson - nucleon coupling , which are essentially fixed by symmetries .",
    "typical examples for such langrangians are : @xmath262 where @xmath263 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 denote pseudoscalar , scalar , and vector couplings / fields , respectively .",
    "the lowest order contributions to the nuclear force from the above lagrangians are the second - order feynman diagrams which , in the center - of - mass frame of the two interacting nucleons , produce the amplitude : @xmath266 where @xmath267 ( @xmath268 ) are vertices derived from the above lagrangians , @xmath269 are dirac spinors representing the nucleons , and @xmath270 and @xmath271 are the nucleon relative momenta in the initial and final states , respectively ; @xmath272 divided by the denominator is the meson propagator .",
    "the simplest meson - exchange model for the nuclear force is the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potential  @xcite which sums over several second - order diagrams , each representing the single exchange of a different boson , @xmath273 : @xmath274 as customary , we include form factors , @xmath275 , applied to the meson - nucleon vertices , and a square - root factor @xmath276 ( with @xmath277 and @xmath278 ; @xmath96 is the nucleon mass ) .",
    "the form factors regularize the amplitudes for large momenta ( short distances ) and account for the extended structure of nucleons in a phenomenological way .",
    "the square root factors make it possible to cast the unitarizing , relativistic , three - dimensional blankenbecler - sugar equation for the scattering amplitude ( a reduced version of the four - dimensional bethe - salpeter equation ) into a form which is identical to the ( nonrelativistic ) lippmann - schwinger equation ( see reference  @xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq_obep ] ) defines a relativistic potential which can be consistently applied in conventional , nonrelativistic nuclear structure .",
    "clearly , the feynman amplitudes , equation  ( [ eq_amp ] ) , are in general nonlocal expressions ; i.  e. , fourier transforming them into configuration space will yield functions of @xmath279 and @xmath280 , the relative distances between the two in- and out - going nucleons , respectively .",
    "the square root factors create additional nonlocality .",
    "while nonlocality appears quite plausible for heavy vector - meson exchange ( corresponding to short distances ) , we have to stress here that even the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) feynman amplitude is nonlocal .",
    "this is important because the pion creates the dominant part of the nuclear tensor force which plays a crucial role in nuclear structure .",
    "applying @xmath281 in equation  ( [ eq_amp ] ) , yields the feynman amplitude for one - pion exchange , @xmath282 where @xmath97 denotes the pion mass and isospin factors are suppressed .",
    "this is the original and correct result for ope .",
    "if one now introduces the drastic approximation , @xmath283 then one obtains the momentum space representation of the _ local _ ope , @xmath284 with @xmath285 .",
    "notice that on - shell , i.  e. , for @xmath286 , @xmath287 equals @xmath288 .",
    "thus , the nonlocality affects the ope potential off - shell .",
    "fourier transform of equation  ( [ eq_opeq ] ) yields the well - known local ope potential in @xmath279-space , @xmath289 \\ ; . \\label{eq_oper}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice , however , that this ` well - established ' local ope potential is only an approximative representation of the correct ope feynman amplitude .",
    "a qed analog is the local coulomb potential _ versus _ the full field - theoretic one - photon - exchange feynman amplitude .",

    "[ tab_pots ]    it is now of interest to know by how much the local approximation changes the original amplitude .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig_pot3sd1 ] , where the half off - shell @xmath38@xmath290 potential , which can be produced only by tensor forces , is shown .",
    "the on - shell momentum @xmath271 is held fixed at 265 mev / c ( equivalent to 150 mev laboratory energy ) , while the off - shell momentum @xmath270 runs from zero to 2000 mev / c .",
    "the on - shell point ( @xmath291 mev / c ) is marked by a solid dot .",
    "the solid curve is the cd - bonn potential which contains the full , nonlocal ope amplitude equation  ( [ eq_operel ] ) .",
    "when the static / local approximation , equation  ( [ eq_opeq ] ) , is made , the dashed curve is obtained . when this approximation is also used for the one-@xmath76 exchange , the dotted curve results .",
    "it is clearly seen that the static / local approximation substantially increases the tensor force off - shell .",
    "certainly , we are not dealing here with negligible effects , and the local approximation is obviously not a good one",
    ".    even though the spirit of the new generation of potentials is more sophisticated , only the cd - bonn potential uses the full , original , nonlocal feynman amplitude for ope , equation  ( [ eq_operel ] ) , while all other potentials still apply the local approximation , equations  ( [ eq_opeq ] ) and ( [ eq_oper ] ) . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the cd - bonn potential has a weaker tensor force as compared to all other potentials .",
    "this is reflected in the predicted d - state probability of the deuteron , @xmath168 , which is due to the nuclear tensor force .",
    "while cd - bonn predicts @xmath292% , the other potentials yield @xmath293% ( cf .  table  [ tab_pots ] ) .",
    "these differences in the strength of the tensor force lead to considerable differences in nuclear structure predictions .",
    "an indication of this is given in table  [ tab_pots ] : the cd - bonn potentials predicts 8.00 mev for the triton binding energy , while the local potentials predict only 7.62 mev .",
    "more discussion of this aspect can be found in references  @xcite .",
    "the ope contribution to the nuclear force essentially takes care of the long - range interaction and the tensor force .",
    "in addition to this , all models must describe the intermediate and short range interaction , for which very different approaches are taken .",
    "the cd - bonn includes ( besides the pion ) the vector mesons @xmath294 and @xmath295 , and two scalar - isoscalar bosons , @xmath121 , using the full , nonlocal feynman amplitudes , equation  ( [ eq_amp ] ) , for their exchanges .",
    "thus , all components of the cd - bonn are nonlocal and the off - shell behavior is the original one that is determined from relativistic field theory .",
    "the models nijm - i and nijm - ii are based upon the nijmegen78 potential  @xcite which is constructed from approximate obe amplitudes . whereas the nijm - ii uses the totally local approximations for all obe contributions , the nijm - i keeps some nonlocal terms in the central force component ( but the nijm - i tensor force is totally local ) .",
    "nonlocalities in the central force have only a very moderate impact on nuclear structure as compared to nonlocalities in the tensor force .",
    "thus , if for some reason one wants to keep only some of the original nonlocalities in the nuclear force and not all of them , then it would be more important to keep the tensor force nonlocalities .",
    "the reid93  @xcite and argonne @xmath250  @xcite potentials do not use meson - exchange for intermediate and short range ; instead , a phenomenological parametrization is chosen .",
    "the argonne @xmath250 uses local functions of woods - saxon type , while reid93 applies local yukawas of multiples of the pion mass , similar to the original reid potential of 1968  @xcite .",
    "at very short distances , the potentials are regularized either by exponential ( @xmath250 , nijm - i , nijm - ii ) or by dipole ( reid93 ) form factors ( which are all local functions ) .    in figure  [ fig_pots ] , the five high - precision potentials ( in momentum space ) and their phase shift predictions",
    "are shown , for the @xmath10 and @xmath38 states .",
    "while the phase shift predictions are indistinguishable , the potentials differ widely  due to the theoretical and mathematical differences discussed .",
    "note that nn potentials differ the most in @xmath34-waves and converge with increasing @xmath296 ( where @xmath296 denotes the total orbital angular momentum of the two - nucleon system ) .",
    "all new potentials are charge - dependent which is essential for obtaining a good @xmath170 for the @xmath8 and @xmath11 data .",
    "thus , each potential comes in three variants : @xmath8 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 .",
    "all potentials include the cib effect from ope",
    ". however , as discussed in section 2.2 , pion mass splitting creates further cib effects through the diagrams of @xmath58 exchange and other two - boson exchange diagrams that involve pions .",
    "another source of cib is irreducible @xmath87 exchange .",
    "recently , these contributions have been evaluated in the framework of chiral perturbation theory by van kolck _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in @xmath297 states ,",
    "the size of this contribution is typically the same as the cib effect from tbe .",
    "thus , tbe and @xmath87 create sizable cib effects in states with @xmath297 .",
    "therefore , a thoroughly constructed , modern , charge - dependent nn potential should include them .",
    "the nn potentials  @xcite ignore these contributions while the latest cd - bonn update  @xcite incorporates them .    a similar comment can be made about csb .",
    "most potentials include only the most trivial effects from nucleon mass splitting , namely the effect on the kinetic energy and on the obe diagrams .",
    "however , as discussed in section 2.1.2 , there are relatively large contributions from tbe that fully explain the csb scattering length difference .",
    "because of the outstanding importance of the csb effect from tbe , it should be included in nn force models ( and , therefore , it has been incorporated in the latest update of the cd - bonn potential  @xcite ) . to have distinct",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 potentials is important for addressing several interesting issues in nuclear physics , like , the @xmath30h-@xmath30he binding energy difference and the nolen - schiffer ( ns ) anomaly  @xcite regarding the energies of neighboring mirror nuclei .",
    "potentials that do not include any csb have no chance to ever explain these phenomena .",
    "some potentials that include csb focus on the @xmath10 state only , since this is where the most reliable empirical information is .",
    "however , even this is not good enough .",
    "a recent study  @xcite has shown that the csb in partial waves with @xmath297 as derived from the bonn model is crucial for a quantitative explanation of the ns anomaly .",
    "nn potentials designed for nuclear structure purposes are typically fitted to the nn scattering data up to pion production threshold or slightly beyond ( e.  g. , 350 mev ) .",
    "a very basic reason for this is that a real potential can not describe the inelasticities of particle production . on the other hand ,",
    "nuclear structure calculations are probably sensitive to the properties of a potential above 350 mev .",
    "for example , the brueckner @xmath298-matrix , which is a crucial quantity in many microscopic approaches to nuclear structure , is the solution of the integral equation , @xmath299 ( where @xmath300 denotes the effective nucleon mass and @xmath161 the pauli projector ) .",
    "notice that the potential @xmath301 is involved in this equation for all momenta from zero to infinity , on- and off - shell .",
    "now , it may very well be true that , as the momenta increase , their importance decreases ( due to the short - range repulsion of the nuclear force and the associated short - range suppression of the nuclear wave function ) .",
    "however , it is also true that the impact of the potential does not suddenly drop to zero as soon as the momenta involved become larger than the equivalent of 350 mev lab .  energy .",
    "thus , there are good arguments why nn potentials should extrapolate in a reasonable way towards higher energies .",
    "we have investigated this issue and found good and bad news .",
    "the good news is that most potentials reproduce in most partial waves the nn phase shifts up to about 1000 mev amazingly well .",
    "the bad news is that there are some singular cases where the reproduction of phase parameters for higher energies is disturbingly bad .",
    "the two most notorious cases are shown in figure  [ fig_extra ] . above 350 mev ,",
    "the @xmath302 mixing parameter is substantially underpredicted by both nijmegen potentials ( n - i and n - ii ) .",
    "the reason for this is that , for @xmath302 , both potentials follow very closely the nijmegen psa  @xcite ( solid dots in figure  [ fig_extra ] ) up to 350 mev .",
    "thus , these potentials are faithfull extrapolations of the nijmegen psa to higher energies . since this extrapolation is wrong , the suspicion is that the nijmegen psa has a wrong trend in the energy range 250 - 350 mev .",
    "new data on @xmath8 spin transfer coefficients  @xcite in the energy range 300 - 500 mev could resolve the issue .",
    "a similar problem occurs in @xmath303 ( figure  [ fig_extra ] ) . here ,",
    "the dashed curve ( n - i ) is the extrapolation of the nijmegen psa , indicating that the analysis may have the wrong trend in the energy range 200 - 350 mev .",
    "we note that , in the two channels discussed , the inelasticity has little impact on the phase parameters shown and would not fix the problems .",
    "the moral is that one should not follow just one analysis , particularly , if that analysis is severely limited in its energy range .",
    "it is important to also keep the broad picture in mind .",
    "during the past decade or so , the research on the nn interaction has proceeded essentially along two lines .",
    "there was the phenomenological line which has produced the high - precision , charge - dependent nn potentials  @xcite .",
    "this was practical work , necessary to provide reliable input for exact few - body calculations and nuclear many - body theory .",
    "the goal of the second line of research was to approach the problem on a more fundamental level . since about 1980",
    ", we have seen many efforts to derive the nuclear force from the underlying theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . due to its nonperturbative character in the low - energy regime",
    ", qcd can not be solved exactly for the problem under consideration .",
    "therefore , so - called qcd - related or qcd - inspired models have been developed , like , skyrmion or soliton models  @xcite and constituent quark cluster models . among the quark models ,",
    "one may distinguish between two types : the hybrid models  @xcite that include meson exchange and the quark delocalization and color screening models  @xcite that do not need ( and do not include ) meson exchange to create the intermediate - range attraction of the nuclear force .",
    "the success of all these efforts based upon qcd modelling is mixed .",
    "the qualitative features of the nuclear force are , in general , predicted correctly , but none of the models is sufficiently quantitative such that it would make sense to apply it in miscroscopic nuclear structure calculations .    in summary ,",
    "one problem of the current status in the field is that quantitative models for the nuclear force have only a poor theoretical background , while theory based models yield only poor results .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and practice has become rather larger than smaller , in the course of the 1990s .",
    "another problem is that the ` theory based models ' are not strictly derived from qcd , they are modeled after qcd  often with handwoven arguments . thus , one may argue that these models are not any better than the traditional meson - exchange models ( that are nowadays perceived as phenomenology ) .",
    "the purpose of physics is to explain nature in fundamental terms .",
    "the two trends just discussed are moving us away from this aim , which is reason for serious concern .",
    "therefore , the main goal of future research on the nuclear force must be to overcome the above discrepancies . to achieve this goal ,",
    "_ we need a basic theory that is amenable to calculation and yields quantitative results . _      in recent years , the concept of effective field theories ( eft ) has drawn considerable attention in particle and nuclear physics  @xcite . the notion of _",
    "effective _ field theories may suggest a difference to _ fundamental _ field theories .",
    "however , it is quite likely that all field theories ( including those that we perceive presently as fundamental ) are effective in the sense that they are low - energy approximations to some ` higher ' theory .",
    "the basis of the eft concept is the recognition of different energy scales in nature .",
    "each energy level has its characteristic degrees of freedom .",
    "as the energy increases and smaller distances are probed , new degrees of freedom become relevant and must be included .",
    "conversely , when the energy drops , some degrees of freedom become irrelevant and are frozen out .",
    "to model the low - energy theory , one relies on a famous ` folk theorem ' by weinberg  @xcite which states :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if one writes down the most general possible langrangian , including _ all _ terms consistent with assumed symmetry principles , and then calculates matrix elements with this langrangian to any given order of perturbation theory , the result will simply be the most general possible s - matrix consistent with analyticity , perturbative unitarity , cluster decomposition , and the assumed symmetry principles .",

    "the langrangian must include all possible terms , because this completeness guarantees that the effective theory is indeed the low - energy limit of the underlying theory .",
    "now , this implies that we are faced with an infinite set of interactions . to make the theory managable",
    ", we need to organize a perturbation expansion .",
    "then , up to a certain order in this expansion , the number of terms that contribute is finite and the theory will yield a well - defined result .    in strong interactions",
    ", the transition from the ` fundamental ' to the effective level happens through a phase transition that takes place around @xmath304 gev via the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry which generates pseudoscalar goldstone bosons .",
    "therefore , at low energies ( @xmath305 ) , the relevant degrees of freedom are not quarks and gluons , but pseudoscalar mesons and other hadrons .",
    "approximate chiral symmetry is reflected in the smallness of the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the effective theory that describes this scenario is known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath306pt )  @xcite .    if we believe in the basic ideas of eft , then , at low energies , @xmath306pt is as fundamental as qcd at high energies .",
    "moreover , due to its perturbative arrangement , @xmath306pt can be calculated : order by order .",
    "so , here we may have what we are asking for : _ a basic theory that is amenable to calculation . _",
    "therefore , @xmath306pt has the potential to overcome the discrepancy between theory and practice that has beset the theoretical research on the nuclear force for so many years .",
    "the idea to derive nuclear forces from chiral effective lagrangians is not new .",
    "a program of this kind was started some 10 years ago by weinberg  @xcite , ordez  @xcite , and van kolck  @xcite which produced the first chiral nn potential by ordez , ray , and van kolck  @xcite .",
    "after the program was initiated , considerable activity ensued  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review , see ref .",
    "even though all authors start from chiral effective langrangians , there are differences in the details .",
    "there is , for example , the ksw scheme  @xcite in which the amplitude of interest is calculated perturbatively . on the other hand",
    ", weinberg proposed to use @xmath306pt for computing the nn potential which consists of irreducible diagrams .",
    "the @xmath34-matrix is then generated by the schrdinger equation .",
    "the first comprehensive work using the weinberg scheme was done by ordez , ray , and van kolck  @xcite who applied time - ordered ( ` old - fashioned ' ) perturbation theory to calculate the irreducible diagrams that define the potential .",
    "this potential posesses one unpleasant property , namely , it is energy dependent .",
    "one can avoid this problem by using the method of unitary transformations , a method that was pioneered by okubo  @xcite .",
    "the okubo tranformation is applied in the recent work by epelbaum , glckle , and meiner  @xcite who construct chiral nn potentials in leading order ( lo ) of @xmath306pt , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "a systematic improvement in the ability of the model to reproduce the nn data is obseerved when stepping up the orders of the chiral expansion .",
    "the nnlo potential of epelbaum _ et al . _",
    "@xcite describes the @xmath11 phase shifts well up to about 100 mev ; above this energy there are discrepancies in some partial waves .",
    "this most recent chiral nn potential represents great progress as compared to earlier ones , however , for meaningfull applications in microscopic nuclear structure , futher quantitative improvements are necessary .",
    "there is one particularly attractive aspect to the @xmath306pt approach in regard to those nuclear structure applications .",
    "if , in the traditional approach , one wants to reproduce , e.  g. , the experimental binding energies of the triton , the alpha particle or other nuclei , one complements the nn potential with a ( phenomenological ) three - nucleon force ( 3nf )  @xcite . since different nn potentials leave different discrepancies to experiment ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab_pots ] ) , the 3nf is adjusted from potential to potential . from a more fundamental point of view , this proceedure is very unsatisfactory , since it lacks any underlying systematics . however , within the framework of traditional meson theory , there is nothing else you can do , because there is no _ a priori _ connection between the off - shell nn potential and the existence of certain many - body forces .    in the framework of @xmath306pt , there is this connection from the outset . in each order of @xmath306pt ,",
    "the two - nucleon force is well - defined on- and off - shell _ and _ it is also well - defined which 3nf terms occur in that order .",
    "at least that s how it should work ` in theory ' .",
    "how it works out in practise remains to be seen .",
    "even though the focus of this review is on the nn interaction at low energy ( below pion production threshold ) , we like to give an indication of the exciting developments at higher energies to ensure that the reader gets an impression of the broader picture .    in the 1990 s , a new experimental effort to measure @xmath8 scattering observables in the range 0.5 to 2.5 gev of projectile energy was started .",
    "the experiments are conducted by the edda group  @xcite at the cooled proton synchrotron ( cosy ) at jlich , germany , and use an internal target .",
    "the outstanding features of this new generation of experiments are high precision ( high statistics ) and small energy steps .",
    "other experiments on nn observables at intermediate and high energies have been performed at saturn ii ( saclay , france )  @xcite and at facilities around the world ; for a complete listing , see ref .",
    "@xcite . moreover , there are the @xmath8 analyzing powers and spin correlation parameters , @xmath307 , that were measured up to lab",
    ".  energies of 11.75 gev by alan krisch and coworkers some 20 years ago at the argonne zero - gradient - synchrotron ( zgs )  @xcite .",
    "the latter data were never explained in a really satisfatory way in spite of some efforts  @xcite . during the past decade , theory has shown little interest in nn scattering at energies of 1 - 10 gev and only a few papers can be cited  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the neglect is probably that these energies are too high for traditional nuclear physicists and too low for high energy physicists ; so , this range is the stepchild of both professions . but this is what makes this window particularly interesting : the energies are too high for @xmath306pt and too low for perturbative qcd .",
    "this fact implies that we have to find an appropriate phenomenology which calls for some phantasy and creativity .",
    "relativistic , chiral meson models that include heavy mesons [ like , @xmath308 and @xmath67 ] and nucleon resonances [ like , the @xmath310 isobar ] are an obvious choice . in the language of eft",
    ", these models can be justified on the basis of ` resonance saturation ' .",
    "it will also be interesting to attempt matching of these high energy models with the @xmath306pt model discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is well - known that relativistic meson models work satisfactorily up to about 1.2 gev  @xcite ; for a summary and critical discussion see section 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite . however , at energies above 1.5 gev , characteristic problems occur , some of which are  @xcite :    * the predicted elastic nn cross sections are too large and grow with energy while experimentally they drop . * the @xmath8 analyzing powers are predicted too large and for other spin observables ( like , @xmath307 ) even the sign is predicted wrong .",
    "the first problem listed above is well - known since the late 1950 s .",
    "the amplitude produced by vector - meson exchange is proportional to @xmath311 ( with @xmath312 the vector - meson mass and @xmath313 the usual mandelstam variables ) which causes the elastic cross sections to rise with energy .",
    "because of this problem , regge theory  @xcite was invented .",
    "concerning the second problem listed above , we do not have a clue at this time . when the vector - meson contribution is ` phased out ' such as to produce the correct elastic cross sections , then the problem with the analyzing powers persists , which is not what we expected . in any case , this energy region offers a wealth of good and unexplained data and a great diversity of potentially appropriate models , since we are truely at the intersection of nuclear and particle physics .",
    "in the 1990 s , we made major progress in our grasp on the nuclear force .",
    "nn data of unparalleled precision were produced , particularly at tunl  @xcite , iucf  @xcite , and cosy  @xcite .",
    "the art of nn phase shift analysis advanced substantially  @xcite .",
    "based upon this empirical progress , nn potentials of unprecedented accuracy ( @xmath170/datum @xmath261 ) were contructed  @xcite . as a consequence of this",
    ", exact few - body calculations and miscroscopic nuclear many - body theory can now be based upon input that is more reliable than ever .    in spite of all this good news",
    ", there are also several questions concerning the nn interaction that remain open and future research should continue to address them . among the more technical problems",
    "is the neutron - neutron scattering length where experiments are still in contradiction .",
    "there are problems with the determination of a precise value for the @xmath0 coupling constant and , not unrelated , the huge and expensive database of neutron - proton differential cross sections  @xcite is inconsistent .    on the theoretical side",
    ", we are still lacking a derivation of the nuclear force that is based upon theory ( in the true sense of the word ) and produces a quantitative nn potential .",
    "moreover , our understanding of charge - dependence of the nn interaction is still incomplete , since we are not able to explain 25% of the charge - dependence of the @xmath10 scattering length .",
