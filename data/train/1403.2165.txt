    "the first statistic is mahonian while the others are stirling , and we then read off many symmetric equidistributed pairs of stirling statistics .",
    "however , it is well known that there are pairs of mahonian statistics with a symmetric joint distribution as well  @xcite , for examples , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are two of them",

    "on the other hand , the generating function obtained in theorem  [ thm : main ] only involves three of the four statistics , hence a natural question is to find a four - variable generating function including @xmath131 as well .",
