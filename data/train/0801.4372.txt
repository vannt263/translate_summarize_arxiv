    "observations of the surface magnetic fields of neutron stars have shown a correlation between the age of the star and the magnetic - field strength .",
    "for instance , young radio pulsars and high - mass x - ray binaries have surface magnetic fields of the order of @xmath0 g , while millisecond pulsars and low - mass x - ray binaries , which are older objects , have magnetic fields @xmath1 g. these observations suggest that the magnetic field is decaying , although this might be a by - product of accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , it is thought that the spontaneous decay of the ultrastrong @xmath2 g magnetic field in _ magnetars _ is the main source of their x - ray luminosity since these objects appear to radiate substantially more power than that available from their rotational energy loss ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since these objects appear to be isolated , the field decay must be attributed to processes intrinsic to the neutron stars .",
    "ref.@xcite ; ( hereafter gr-92 ) identified three long - term mechanisms that can promote the spontaneous decay of the magnetic field in the interior of neutron stars :    1 .   _ ambipolar diffusion _",
    ", i.e. the drift of the magnetic field and the charged particles relative to the neutrons .",
    "@xcite ; ( hereafter td-96 ) , using magnetar parameters , estimated the timescale of the magnetic field decay by means of ambipolar diffusion , finding that was consistent with the timescale of @xmath3 years observed for these objects . 2 .   _ hall drift _",
    ", a non - dissipative advection of the magnetic field by the associated electrical current ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   _ ohmic diffusion _ , a dissipative process caused by electrical resistivity ( see also baym et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "all of these processes occur over timescales of thousands of years or more , compared to typical dynamical timescales ( sound and alfvn ) of miliseconds to seconds .",
    "the work of gr-92 was analytical , and therefore useful to identify general processes and relevant timescales , but it did not address the action of the identified processes in their full nonlinear development and their interactions with each other .",
    "the full evolution of the magnetic field can only be addressed by numerical simulations .    regarding the geometrical configuration of the magnetic field , three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations showed that in a stable stratified , non - rotating star , the initial field evolves on a short , alfvn - like timescale to a large - scale equilibrium configuration that can be axisymmetric ( @xcite ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) or non - axisymmetric ( @xcite ) , depending on the radial dependence of the initial magnetic - field strength .",
    "these simulations , being focused on the evolution of the magnetic field over short dynamical timescales , were carried out within the framework of the mhd theory , which considers the stellar matter to be a single fluid .",
    "the evolution of these configurations has not yet been studied over longer timescales , on which relative motions of different particle species are present and the processes studied by gr-92 become important .",
    "the description of these long - term processes requires a multi - fluid theory .    in this paper",
    "we extend the model of gr-92 by allowing both neutron and charged - particle movements , rather than considering the neutrons as a fixed background ( see sect .  [ phys ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a plane - parallel system where the magnetic field points in one cartesian direction but varies only along an orthogonal direction .",
    "although this one - dimensional model is unrealistic , it allows us to study the basic evolutionary processes in an analytical and numerical fashion with no serious complications before considering a realistic stellar geometry in more dimensions .",
    "gr-92 considered all the species in the star as non - interacting fermions ; in contrast , we use equations of state including interactions among protons and neutrons .",
    "since in neutron stars the magnetic pressure is much less than the degeneracy pressure of the particles , we treat the particle densities in terms of small perturbations around a non - magnetized background in full equilibrium .",
    "thus , we obtain a system of equations that is nonlinear with respect to the magnetic field but linear with respect to the particle densities ( see sect .  [ 1dmodel ] ) .",
    "we will show that the magnetic field and particle species evolve through successive quasi - equilibrium states .",
    "we describe the basic physical processes of this evolution and estimate analytically the characteristic timescales required to reach these quasi - equilibrium states .",
    "we find that these timescales depend on the values of physical parameters in the system , such as the magnetic - field intensity , the collision rate between the charged particles and the neutrons , the weak interaction rate , and the ohmic resistivity ( sect .  [ carsca ] ) . to obtain an analytic solution of the system of partial differential equations , we linearize the equations with respect to the magnetic field and find normal - mode solutions ( sect .  [ normmodes ] ) and obtain analytical approximations for the decay times in appendix [ apa ] .",
    "we develop numerical simulations ( whose basic algorithm is described in appendix [ apb ] ) in the linear regime and compare with the normal - mode results ( sect .",

    "[ finnoli ] , we carry out numerical simulations in the nonlinear regime and verify the conservation laws of our model . finally in sect .",

    "we model the stellar interior as an electrically - neutral and slightly - ionized plasma composed of three moving - particle species : neutrons @xmath4 , protons @xmath5 , and electrons @xmath6 .",
    "this is an extension of the model of gr-92 , since these authors considered the neutrons to form a motionless background .",
    "furthermore , we account for strong interactions between neutrons and protons by writing each of their chemical potentials as a function of both of their number densities : @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "we consider the electrons to be an ideal , relativistic fermi gas , and write their chemical potential as a function only of their own density , @xmath8^{2/3}}$ ] , with @xmath9 the electron rest mass .",

    "the collisional coupling strengths are parametrized by the symmetric matrix @xmath19 that depends generally on the local density and temperature .",
    "we ignore the effects of superfluidity or superconductivity , as well as additional particles that might be present in neutron stars .    in the early stages of the neutron - star formation",
    ", particles are locked by collisions , which behave as a single fluid .",
    "alfvn waves propagate across the star , allowing it to reach a _",
    "magnetohydrostatic quasi - equilibrium _ state in which all forces acting on a fluid element are closely in balance .",

    "<S> this paper is the first in a series that aims to understand the long - term evolution of neutron star magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we model the stellar matter as an electrically neutral and lightly - ionized plasma composed of three moving particle species : neutrons , protons , and electrons ; these species can be converted into each other by weak interactions ( beta decays ) , suffer binary collisions , and be affected by each other s macroscopic electromagnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> since the evolution of the magnetic field occurs over thousands of years or more , compared to dynamical timescales ( sound and alfvn ) of milliseconds to seconds , we use a slow - motion approximation in which we neglect the inertial terms in the equations of motion for the particles . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation leads to three nonlinear partial - differential equations describing the evolution of the magnetic field , as well as the movement of two fluids : the charged particles ( protons and electrons ) and the neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are first rather than second order in time ( involving the velocities of the three species but not their accelerations ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we restrict ourselves to a one - dimensional geometry in which the magnetic field points in one cartesian direction , but varies only along an orthogonal direction . </S>",
    "<S> we study the evolution of the system in three different ways : ( i ) estimating timescales directly from the equations , guided by physical intuition ; ( ii ) a normal - mode analysis in the limit of a nearly uniform system ; and ( iii ) a finite - difference numerical integration of the full set of nonlinear partial - differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> we find good agreement between our analytical normal - mode solutions and the numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the magnetic field and the particles evolve through successive quasi - equilibrium states , on timescales that can be understood by physical arguments . </S>",
    "<S> depending on parameter values , the magnetic field can evolve by ohmic diffusion or by ambipolar diffusion , the latter being limited either by interparticle collisions or by relaxation to chemical quasi - equilibrium through beta decays . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulations are further validated by verifying that they satisfy the known conservation laws in highly nonlinear situations . </S>"
