    "it has been known for some time that the alexander polynomial of a closed braid @xmath0 can be found from the burau matrix @xmath1 , @xcite .",
    "this relation was extended in @xcite to present the @xmath2-variable alexander polynomial @xmath3 of the link consisting of the closed braid @xmath0 together with its axis @xmath4 as the characteristic polynomial , @xmath5 , of the reduced @xmath6 burau matrix @xmath7 of the braid @xmath1 .",
    "the alexander polynomial of @xmath0 can be recovered by applying the torres - fox formula to the @xmath2-variable polynomial to get the equation @xmath8    in this paper i give a similar method for finding the multivariable alexander polynomial of a link @xmath9 presented as the closure of a braid @xmath1 .",
    "the main ingredient is a readily constructed multivariable version of the reduced burau matrices .",
    "other versions of ` coloured ' burau matrices have been developed , for example by penne , @xcite , which can be interpreted as determining linear presentations of suitably extended versions of the braid group .",
    "the most useful feature of the matrices which are used here is that they are extremely simple to remember and they give an immediate and very straightforward construction of the alexander polynomial of a closed braid and axis , leading at once to the polynomial of the closed braid . for a pure braid the resulting matrix is conjugate to a reduced version of the gassner matrix ;",
    "the construction given here has the advantage that it applies to any braid which presents the link , and does not require the braid to be rewritten in any special form .",
    "an implementation of this calculation by a maple procedure , which returns the multivariable alexander polynomial of @xmath0 given the braid @xmath1 , was made in early 1996 by a liverpool msc student , julian hodgson , and is usually available from the liverpool knot - theory website,@xmath10http:@xmath10@xmath10www.liv.ac.uk@xmath10puremaths@xmath10knots.html .",
    "given a homomorphism @xmath11 from the group @xmath12 of an oriented link @xmath9 to an abelian group @xmath13 we can use fox s free differential calculus on a presentation of @xmath12 to find an invariant of @xmath9 which lies in the group ring @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the full multivariable alexander polynomial @xmath15 arises when @xmath13 is the abelianisation @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the natural projection . in this case",
    "@xmath13 is the free abelian group on @xmath18 generators , @xmath19 say , where @xmath9 has @xmath18 components @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for every oriented meridian @xmath22 of the component @xmath23 . then @xmath24 $ ] is a laurent polynomial in @xmath19 . any other homomorphism @xmath11 factors through a homomorphism @xmath25 and the resulting invariant is given by substituting the images of @xmath26 in @xmath15 , @xcite .",
    "label the individual strings of @xmath27 by @xmath28 , putting the label @xmath29 on the string which starts from the point @xmath30 at the bottom .",
    "figure [ braid ] shows this labelling for the braid @xmath31    write @xmath32 for the @xmath6 matrix which differs from the unit matrix only in the three places shown on row @xmath33 , for @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 when @xmath36 or @xmath37 the matrix is truncated appropriately to give two non - zero entries in row @xmath33 .",
    "now construct the _ coloured reduced burau matrix _ @xmath38 of the general braid @xmath39 as a product of matrices @xmath32 , in which @xmath40 is the label of the current undercrossing string .",
    "this gives @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the label of the undercrossing string at crossing @xmath43 , counted from the top of the braid .",
    "each braid @xmath1 determines a permutation @xmath50 by the representation of @xmath51 on @xmath52 in which a string connects position @xmath30 at the bottom to position @xmath53 at the top . in the example above @xmath54 .",
    "the multivariable alexander polynomial @xmath55 , where @xmath4 is the axis of the closed @xmath56-braid @xmath0 , is given by the characteristic polynomial @xmath57 with the identifications @xmath58 .",
    "[ multi ]    remarks : ( 1)suppose that a link @xmath9 is presented as the closure of a braid @xmath1 on @xmath56 strings and that some homomorphism @xmath11 is given .",
    "look at the part of the diagram of @xmath9 which consists of @xmath1 .",
    "the oriented meridians @xmath59 for the strings at the bottom of @xmath1 determine elements @xmath60 . at each point",
    "further up the braid the meridian of a string which starts at the bottom as string @xmath30 will be mapped to the same element in @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , when the braid is closed to form @xmath9 the strings @xmath30 and @xmath61 are identified , so that @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath63 is the product of @xmath18 disjoint cycles then the link @xmath64 has @xmath18 components .",
    "the variables in the resulting polynomial are @xmath65 and a @xmath18-element subset of @xmath28 after the identifications have been made . in the case @xmath66 the substitution @xmath67 in the matrix @xmath47 gives the standard reduced burau matrix @xmath68 for @xmath1 .",
    "( 2)the discussion of the alexander polynomials of a link with @xmath18 components can be done most uniformly in terms of the _ alexander invariant _ @xmath69 of the link , defined by @xmath70 the torres - fox formula gives the alexander invariant of a sublink @xmath9 of a link @xmath71 in terms of the invariant for @xmath71 .",
    "it says that @xmath72 where the meridian of the curve @xmath73 to be suppressed is replaced by @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the element represented by the curve @xmath73 in the complement of @xmath9 , abelianised appropriately .",
    "thus we can calculate the alexander invariant of @xmath64 from theorem [ multi ] by suppressing the axis and applying the torres - fox formula .",
    "put @xmath76 and note that @xmath77 in the complement of @xmath9 , to get @xmath78 making any identifications @xmath79 required where strings of @xmath1 belong to the same component of @xmath9 . in the case when @xmath9 has one component this gives the well - known formula @xmath80 quoted earlier .",
    "apply fox s free differential calculus to a presentation of the fundamental group of the closed braid and axis , very much as in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the heart of the proof lies in relating the fundamental group of the @xmath56-punctured disk spanning the axis @xmath4 which meets @xmath0 at the bottom of @xmath1 to the corresponding group for the disk at the top of @xmath1 .",
    "write @xmath59 for the generators of the group at the bottom represented by meridian loops around the punctures , and @xmath81 for the meridian loops around the punctures at the top .",
    "it is well known that @xmath81 can be expressed in terms of @xmath59 as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is an automorphism of the free group @xmath84 determined by the braid @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore the map @xmath85 from the braid group @xmath51 to @xmath86 is itself a group homomorphism . then @xmath87 is the composite of elementary automorphisms corresponding to the elementary braids making up @xmath1 , which are given explicitly by @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the group of the link @xmath91 is presented by a generator @xmath65 , arising from a meridian of @xmath4 , and generators @xmath59 as above , with @xmath56 relations @xmath92 .",
    "the reduced burau matrix shows up most naturally by using a different system of generators @xmath93 for @xmath84 , defined recursively by @xmath94 .",
    "the element @xmath95 can be represented by a loop in the disk which encircles the first @xmath33 punctures as indicated in figure [ disc ] .",
    "the automorphism @xmath96 then satisfies @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    the standard method for finding the alexander invariant of a link ( or knot ) @xmath9 evaluated in",
    "@xmath14 $ ] using a homomorphism @xmath11 starting from a presentation of @xmath12 by @xmath99 generators @xmath100 and @xmath56 relations @xmath101 is the following .",
    "calculate the @xmath102 matrix @xmath103 of free derivatives , and evaluate the entries in @xmath14 $ ] by applying @xmath17 . then delete one column corresponding to a generator @xmath104 , say , with @xmath105 , and divide the determinant of the remaining matrix by @xmath106 .",
    "the result is the evaluation of the alexander invariant , that is , the multi - variable alexander polynomial when @xmath9 has more than one component , or @xmath107 when @xmath9 is a knot . where a relation is written in the form @xmath108 the entries @xmath109 work equally well in the matrix .",
    "the chain rule for free derivatives @xcite shows that if we write @xmath111 and set @xmath112 then @xmath113 and @xmath114 we can then compute the matrix @xmath115 as the product of matrices @xmath116 , where @xmath117 runs through the elementary braids @xmath118 in @xmath1 .",
    "apply @xmath17 to the matrix to get @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "this is the value of @xmath17 on the meridian at the undercrossing in the current elementary braid @xmath119 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath124 we get the matrix @xmath125 with @xmath126 which is again the value of @xmath17 on the meridian of the undercrossing string .",
    "the generator @xmath127 is clearly unchanged by any automorphism @xmath87 , so the last row in each of the matrices of partial derivatives is @xmath128 .",
    "the leading @xmath6 submatrix for the partial derivatives of @xmath129 is then the product of the leading submatrices from the constituent elementary braids , and so is the reduced colured burau matrix of @xmath1 introduced earlier , with @xmath130 .",
    "thus @xmath131 for some column @xmath132 .",
    "the matrix of free derivatives arising from the presentation of the group by generators @xmath93 and @xmath65 given above is the @xmath102 matrix whose first @xmath56 columns , corresponding to the generators @xmath93 , are @xmath133 .",
    "these columns form the matrix @xmath134 .",
    "they arise from the full matrix of free derivatives by deleting the column corresponding to the generator @xmath65 , so the alexander invariant for the link is the determinant of this matrix divided by @xmath135 . now",
    ". then @xmath57 , making the identifications of variables @xmath137 forced by matching the strings at the top and bottom , is the alexander polynomial of the closed braid and its axis , up to a power of @xmath65 ."
