    "the hellmann - feynman theorem ( from now on the hf theorem ) is a useful tool in solid state , atomic and molecular physics .",
    "one of its consequences being that in quantum mechanics there is a single way of defining a generalized force on eigenstates of the hamiltonian , associated to the variation of some of its parameters .",
    "classically , given a hamiltonian @xmath0 depending on a parameter @xmath1 ( which can be a generalized coordinate ) , one can define a generalized force @xmath2 which is associated with that parameter in the sense that @xmath3 is the work done in changing the parameter by @xmath4 .",
    "however , in quantum mechanics there are , in principle , two possible ways to implement that definition : given the quantum hamiltonian @xmath5 ( with eigenvalues @xmath6 and normalized eigenvectors @xmath7 ) , we can define the generalized force acting on the state @xmath7 as @xmath8 or as the expectation value of @xmath9 on the state @xmath7 , which gives @xmath10 .",
    "the hf theorem ensures that both definitions are equivalent , i. e. @xmath11 where , obviously , the differentiability of @xmath12 and @xmath13 with respect to @xmath1 is assumed . this equation is known as the differential form of the hf theorem and from it we can obtain the integrated version , @xmath14 and the off diagonal form , @xmath15 the equations ( [ uno]-[dosp ] ) , and others derived from them have been used in many areas of physics and specially in solid state and molecular physics , with the pioneering work of feynman @xcite proving the , so called , electrostatic theorem .",
    "taking @xmath1 to be the coordinate @xmath16 of the position of the nucleus @xmath17 and assuming that there are no external fields , the hf theorem states that the force on nucleus @xmath17 due to the other nuclei and the electrons , in some particular configuration , is exactly what could be computed in classical electrostatics from the location of the other nuclei and the electronic charge density .",
    "furthermore , the use of the hf theorem has been extended to variational states that are not the true eigenstates of the hamiltonian or even to gamow states ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are also systems for which the hf theorem fails for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , even if they fulfill the general conditions established for the validity of the theorem ( differentiability with respect to the parameter ) .",
    "as we shall see later , these situations are related to the fact that in quantum systems the hamiltonian can depend on a parameter , not only through an explicit dependence in the operator but also because the domain of definition of the hamiltonian depends on that parameter .",
    "this happens , for instance , when the hamiltonian contains interactions that are gauge invariant and then , the functional form of @xmath18 and the boundary conditions for the functions of its domain both depend on the particular gauge we chose . in this case , as we shall see , the standard derivation of the hf theorem is not valid and a generalization is needed to cover those systems .",
    "this is precisely the main goal of this contribution .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section we present a simple example of a hamiltonian with magnetic interactions for which the hf theorem fails , in section 3 we derive the generalization of the hf theorem , the application to some hamiltonians , including the one mentioned above , is contained in section 4 , and finally we sketch the conclusions .",
    "in this section we present an example of a system for which the standard form of the hf theorem ( [ uno ] ) fails .",
    "the system describes a nonrelativistic charged particle moving on a circumference @xmath19 and interacting with a magnetic field which is confined in some region @xmath20 on the interior of @xmath19 with magnetic flux equal to @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ rot ] ) .",
    "this is a model for the superconducting cooper pairs moving on a ring that is transversed by a magnetic flux @xmath22 @xcite .",
    ", width=151 ]    using suitable units , and in a gauge where the electromagnetic field @xmath23 is tangent to the circumference , with constant norm @xmath24 and directed in the anticlockwise direction ( consequently the flux through @xmath20 is @xmath25 ) , the hamiltonian can be written @xmath26 acting on periodic functions .",
    "the domain of definition of the hamiltonian @xmath27 may be taken as the set of twice differentiable functions @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 $ ] ) , such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in @xmath27 , @xmath18 is essentially selfadjoint and has the eigenvalues and normalized eigenvectors : @xmath32 note that the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian do not depend on @xmath24 . in this gauge ,",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 and the hf equation ( [ uno ] ) is exactly satisfied @xmath35    however , we could also work in another gauge obtained by the unitary transformation @xmath36",
    "so that the domain of definition @xmath37 of the transformed hamiltonian is the set of twice differentiable functions @xmath28 ( with @xmath38 $ ] ) , such that @xmath39    in @xmath37 the hamiltonian @xmath40 is again essentially selfadjoint and , obviously , has the same eigenvalues that @xmath18 with eigenvectors @xmath41    in this gauge , the kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xmath42 does not depend on @xmath24 whereas its eigenvectors and the domain of definition depend and , consequently , it is clear that the hf equation ( [ uno ] ) is not valid for @xmath40 since @xmath43 now , the hf theorem fails because with the gauge transformation we have transferred the dependence on the electromagnetic field from the kinetic part of @xmath18 to the domain of definition of @xmath40 , a situation that is not taken into account in this form of the theorem .",
    "the key point here is that , because @xmath37 depends on @xmath24 , some quantities like @xmath44 must be handled carefully because the domains of definition of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are different and @xmath40 is a non bounded operator .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen an example that illustrates the need of a generalization of hf theorem in order to include the cases in which the domain of definition of the hamiltonian also depends on the parameter we differentiate with respect to .",
    "consider a selfadjoint hamiltonian @xmath5 with domain @xmath47 , eigenvalues @xmath6 and normalized eigenvectors @xmath7 .",
    "assume differentiability with respect to the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "taking derivatives in the identity @xmath48 we find @xmath49 note that in order to make sense of the previous expression , one has to extend @xmath5 to an operator defined in a domain that includes @xmath47 for any @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the extended hamiltonian will not be selfadjoint in general and therefore the expressions that involve such a non hermitian operator must be handled with care .",
    "that is the key point of the rest of the paper .",
    "adding and subtracting a term @xmath50 , and using the fact that @xmath51 for normalized eigenvectors , we finally obtain the desired generalization of the hellmann feynman theorem : @xmath52 with @xmath53 compared with the equation ( [ uno ] ) , we have a new term @xmath54 that vanishes for states @xmath7 in @xmath47 such that @xmath55 is also in @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the normal form of hf theorem ( [ uno ] ) is recovered . however , in general , for states @xmath7 such that @xmath56 , the new factor @xmath57 can give an extra contribution to the second term of the hf equation ( [ ghf ] ) .",
    "the generalization of the other forms of the hf theorem can be obtained in a similar way . for the integrated form we have @xmath58 with @xmath59 and",
    "the off diagonal formulation is @xmath60 where the anomalous term is now @xmath61",
    "now we can apply the equations ( [ ghf],[ghf1 ] ) to the charged planar rotor interacting with a confined magnetic field that was analyzed in section 2 . for the hamiltonian @xmath18 defined in ( [ tres ] ) we obtain @xmath62 ( because in this case @xmath63 )",
    "and we recover the equation ( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath40 we have : @xmath64 consequently @xmath65 is not in @xmath37 .",
    "now we can evaluate @xmath54 as : @xmath66 that integrating by parts ( or evaluated directly ) gives a boundary term : @xmath67_0^{2   \\pi }   \\ , -\\",
    ",   \\left [   \\psi_{g , n}^*(\\epsilon,\\theta ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta }   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\psi_{g , n}(\\epsilon,\\theta ) \\right]_0^{2   \\pi } \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\epsilon -n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is interesting to note that in this case , the origin of the extra term @xmath54 can be related to the anomalous virial theorem for these kind of systems @xcite .",
    "another example of a system where the standard form ( [ uno ] ) of the hf theorem fails is a non relativistic particle in two dimensions interacting with a @xmath68 potential .",
    "this system has been studied in @xcite as an example of anomalous symmetry breaking in quantum mechanics .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath69 transforms under dilations , @xmath70 , in a homogeneous way @xmath71 .",
    "this means that it can not have any normalizable eigenvector with energy different from zero , since if @xmath72 is an eigenstate with energy @xmath73 , then @xmath74 is also an eigenstate with energy @xmath75 for any real number @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath18 is selfadjoint the previous property implies that the only point in the discrete spectrum is @xmath77 .",
    "it is also known , however , that in this system the @xmath78 symmetry is anomalously broken and there is one s - wave normalized eigenstate @xmath79 which has an energy @xmath80 where in ( [ eigen ] ) the @xmath81 bessel function was used and the value of @xmath76 determines the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "the apparent contradiction is solved by the fact that although the hamiltonian transforms mutiplicatively by a dilation its domain is not preserved and therefore the dilation does not actually produce any new eigenvectors for the original hamiltonian .    to see that",
    ", we can solve the s - wave sector of the hamiltonian ( [ deltap ] ) by renormalizing the coupling @xmath1 as in @xcite or by working in @xmath82 , in order to avoid the singularity at the origin @xcite . in polar",
    "coordinates with hamiltonian @xmath83 defined on the domain @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "\\label{dh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this domain @xmath86 is essentially selfadjoint .",
    "the meaning of this conditions is that if @xmath87 then for @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 the subtraction point .",
    "now , it is easy to see that @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the infinitesimal generator of the dilations symmetry which is anomalously broken because if @xmath93 then @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "as the differentiation with respect to the parameter @xmath76 do not preserves the domain , only the general form of the hf theorem is valid .",
    "in fact one can compute @xmath96_0^\\infty \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{\\hbar^2 \\alpha } { m}\\ , .",
    "\\label{19 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the generalized hellman - feynman theorem ( [ ghf ] ) holds .",
    "notice that the evaluation of @xmath97 do not requires the knowledge of @xmath98 but only its behaviour at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which is fixed by the boundary conditions on the domain @xmath101 .",
    "there is a similarity between this system and the one analyzed previously , here we have eliminated the divergent term of the potential by avoiding the origin and introducing some boundary conditions for the functions of the domain of the hamiltonian in that point and , in this way , we have transferred the dependence with the parameter from the hamiltonian to its domain of definition , exactly the same that happened in the first example . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of the @xmath97 term is related to the property that @xmath102 does not keep the domain of @xmath18 invariant , a fact whose main consequence is the appearance of a conformal anomaly in the system .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to present a generalization of the well known hellmann - feynman theorem to enlarge its range of applicability . in particular , our generalization allows to deal with several interesting cases where the hamiltonian of the system depends on a parameter , not only in the explicit expression of the operator , but also in its domain of definition .",
    "we also present some remarkable examples to show a few applications of the generalization of the theorem .",
