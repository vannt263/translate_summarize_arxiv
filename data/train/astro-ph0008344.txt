    "the strong forward and reverse shocks in young supernova remnants ( snrs ) heat the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) and supernova ejecta material to x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "this x - ray emission contains information on the supernova ( e.g. , type , explosion energy , mass and composition of ejecta ) and on the nature of the ambient medium ( e.g. , uniform , stellar wind ) .",
    "in addition to heating the plasma , the forward and reverse shocks are thought to accelerate some fraction of the shocked material to cosmic ray energies .",
    "a large body of evidence suggests that this acceleration can be quite efficient with as much as 50% of the ram kinetic energy of the ejecta being placed in relativistic particles and removed from the thermal plasma ( blandford & eichler @xcite ; jones & ellison @xcite ; kang & jones @xcite ; berezhko , ksenofontov , & petukhov @xcite ) , and some early work investigated its observational impact ( heavens @xcite , boulares & cox @xcite , dorfi & bhringer @xcite ) .",
    "however , despite the expected efficiency of shock acceleration , the modeling and interpretation of x - ray observation from snrs are generally done assuming that the shocks _ do not _ place a significant fraction of their energy in cosmic rays .    the recent discovery of nonthermal x - ray emission in shell - like snrs like sn1006 ( koyama et al .",

    "@xcite ) , g347.3 - 0.5 ( slane et al .",
    "@xcite ) and rcw86 ( borkowski @xcite ) has shown that snr shocks do accelerate electrons to tev energies and supports the case for efficient proton acceleration and the necessity of investigating its effects in the modeling of thermal x - ray emission .",
    "besides providing a more self - consistent snr model , x - ray models of cosmic ray modified snrs provide a test of the fundamental assumption that snrs are the primary sources of galactic cosmic ray ions .",
    "since shocks put more energy into accelerated ions than electrons ,  effects seen in x - ray emission will be evidence for the efficient shock acceleration of ions as well .    here ,",
    "we investigate the effects of efficient particle acceleration on the hydrodynamics and thermal x - ray emission of young snrs .",
    "we have developed a model which couples self - similar hydrodynamics ( chevalier @xcite ) to  diffusive shock acceleration ( berezhko & ellison @xcite ; berezhko  @xcite ; ellison , berezhko , & baring @xcite ) , and x - ray emission including non - equilibrium ionization effects ( decourchelle & ballet @xcite ) .",
    "we show that a modified self - similar approach is relevant in most cases and compare it to the standard unmodified  case .",
    "there is convincing direct and indirect evidence from spacecraft observations and plasma simulations that collisionless shocks are efficient  accelerators .",
    "consequently , they self - generate magnetic turbulence and develop a smooth shock precursor ( drury @xcite ; blandford & eichler @xcite ; jones & ellison @xcite ; achterberg , blandford , & reynolds @xcite ; terasawa  @xcite ; ellison  @xcite ) .",
    "when the acceleration is , the shock compression ratio increases and the shocked temperature decreases compared to  values . the entire proton spectrum must be accounted for self - consistently with a non - thermal tail connecting the quasi - thermal population to the energetic one ; any change in the relativistic population must impact the thermal population .",
    "in contrast , the slope and normalization of test - particle power laws can be changed without changing the temperature and density of the shock heated gas .",
    "a description of  effects and the model used here is given in berezhko & ellison ( @xcite ) , ellison ( @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of young snrs can be described by self - similar solutions ( chevalier @xcite ; nadezhin @xcite ) provided that the initial density profiles in the ejecta and in the ambient medium have power law density distributions , respectively @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) , where @xmath4 is the radius , @xmath5 the snr age and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constant .",
    "@xmath6 can be expressed in terms of the explosion energy and ejected mass ( decourchelle & ballet @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of cosmic ray pressure on snr dynamics were first considered by chevalier ( @xcite ) using a two - fluid , self - similar solution with a thermal gas ( adiabatic index @xmath8 ) and a relativistic gas ( @xmath9 ) having an arbitrary constant fraction of the total energy . here , we use chevalier s ( @xcite ) solutions for driven waves but with boundary conditions calculated from the shock acceleration model from berezhko & ellison ( 1999 ) .    as a function of shock velocity , @xmath10 , ambient density , @xmath11 , unshocked magnetic field , @xmath12 , and ambient temperature @xmath13 , as well as the maximum particle energy , @xmath14",
    "is determined from the shock radius , age , and diffusive mean free path ( e.g. , ellison , berezhko , & baring @xcite ) . ] and injection efficiency , @xmath15 ( the fraction of protons with superthermal energies ) , the  model yields downstream values for the density and pressures in the thermal and relativistic gases , at the forward and reverse shocks .",
    "wave heating in the precursor is used , reducing the efficiency compared to adiabatic heating . starting with test - particle solutions at a given age , we iterate until the modified solutions and nonlinear boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "our solutions neglect cosmic ray diffusion ( assuming they are spatially coupled to the gas  an excellent approximation for all but the highest energy particles ) , and assume that both the compression ratio and the relativistic to total pressure ratio are independent of time at either shock , which is required for self - similarity to be valid .    unless explicitly stated , we take @xmath16  k and @xmath17  at both shocks . for the snr parameters ,",
    "we take : @xmath18 cgs , corresponding to @xmath19 erg , and @xmath20 amu/@xmath21 .",
    "we can _ a posteriori _ determine the validity of the self - similar assumption , by examining the variation versus time of the compression ratio and relativistic to total pressure ratio , at the reverse shock ( rs ) and at the forward shock ( fs ) . as seen in figure  1 , these ratios are nearly constant for injection parameters @xmath22 and negligible for @xmath23 , so that the self - similar solutions are well justified in these cases .    for values of @xmath24 , unmodified solutions can occur at very high sonic mach numbers @xmath25 ( i.e. , early ages ) which show a rapid transition to  solutions as @xmath25 drops ( see berezhko & ellison @xcite ) .",
    "the self - similar approach is valid if this rapid transition occurs early or late compared to the age of the snr .",
    "figure  2 shows the density and temperature as a function of radius for various values of @xmath15 . as @xmath15 increases",
    ", the compression ratio becomes higher ( up to 15 here instead of 4 ) , while the shocked temperature drops ( nearly a factor of 10 between the  result and @xmath26 ) .",
    "such trends were expected from chevalier ( @xcite ) , but the actual effects lead to larger modifications because of the influence of particle escape : the maximum compression ratio is no longer limited to 7 , but can rise , in principle , to infinite values .",
    "= 0.98    notably , these modifications occur for @xmath27 , considerably lower than that deduced for the earth s bow shock and from plasma simulations ( @xmath28 ; ellison @xcite ) .",
    "table 1 gives the relative fractions of kinetic , @xmath29 , thermal , @xmath30 , cosmic ray , @xmath31 , and escaped energy , @xmath32 , summed over the shocked ejecta and the shocked ambient medium .",
    "an important fraction of the energy can be carried off by escaping particles .",
    "note that in young snrs , the total energy in the shocked region increases with time as more and more ejecta is being shocked .",
    "cosmic ray modified dynamics lead to a thinner interaction region between the forward and reverse shocks and much larger density and pressure gradients .",
    "this suggests that the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities in the shocked material near the contact discontinuity will be faster than otherwise . with a forward shock closer to the contact discontinuity",
    ", this may help these turbulent effects extend to the forward shock and beyond .",
    "equally important , the higher densities and lower temperatures will lead to more rapid coulomb equilibration than expected in a test - particle case .",

    ", the temperature should drop below x - ray emitting values earlier .",
    "we have coupled our modified hydrodynamics model to the calculation of the non - equilibrium ionization and thermal x - ray emission .",
    "the ionization and recombination rates have been taken from arnaud & rothenflug ( @xcite ) and arnaud & raymond ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray emission code is from mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord ( @xcite ) and mewe , lemen , & van den oord ( @xcite ) .",
    "the abundances in the interstellar medium are taken to be solar ( meyer @xcite ) .",
    "we assume full equipartition between the electrons and ions ( @xmath34 ) and neglect any contribution from the superthermal electrons to the ionization or line excitation . for efficient shock acceleration , this may be important and we are investigating these effects ( porquet et al . 2000 ) .",

    "( kinugasa & tsunemi 1999 ) and _ rxte _ ( decourchelle & petre 1999 ; decourchelle et al . 2000 ) . for several values of @xmath15 , we adjust the snr parameters to fit the observed spectrum , which is dominated by the emission from the shocked ejecta as shown in figure  3 .",
    "all values of @xmath15 yield similar values for the reduced chi - squared ( @xmath35 ) , the ionization timescale , the reverse shock temperature @xmath36 kev , the hydrogen column density @xmath37  @xmath38 , and oversolar abundances of heavy elements in the shocked ejecta ( o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe ) .",
    "the derived values of forward and reverse shock compression ratios ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , fs and rs speeds ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , ambient density , distance , and the energy - mass relation are , however , very different as shown in table  2 .    to get a temperature high enough to produce the iron k - line and the high energy continuum ,",
    "all  fits require larger shock velocities and lower ambient densities .",
    "these imply more kinetic energy in the ejecta and a larger inferred distance , @xmath43 , than the  case . to obtain a distance consistent with observations",
    "( 4.8 @xmath44 1.4 kpc , reynoso and goss @xcite ) , a low efficiency at the reverse shock is required .",
    "this can be done in three ways : with @xmath45at the reverse shock large enough to dampen acceleration , with @xmath46  and @xmath47 to allow high mach number , unmodified solutions , or with no reverse shock acceleration ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "a low magnetic field is expected from the expansion of the ejecta , but magnetic field amplification could increase it . in all cases ,",
    "a good fit is obtained for efficient acceleration at the forward shock and test - particle conditions at the reverse shock .",
    "figure 3 and table 2 ( last row ) show the case with @xmath49 .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy is required to confirm both a low efficiency of the acceleration at the reverse shock and our prediction of efficient acceleration at the forward shock , which is expected for standard values of the upstream density and magnetic field .",
    "the arbitrary power law component required to fit the broad - band x - ray continuum ( decourchelle & petre @xcite ) is likely related to the forward shock . in future work",
    ", this component will be replaced by including self - consistently the nonthermal continuum , and using additional constraints on the acceleration parameters from the radio data .",
    "nonlinear effects from efficient particle acceleration strongly influence the x - ray emission in snrs , and may serve as a tracer of cosmic ray acceleration . here , we have focused on the consequences of shock acceleration on the thermal x - ray emission and have presented the first , non - equilibrium ionization modeling of the x - ray emission from a specific snr . while our self - similar approach has limitations which must be carefully considered , we believe it contains the essential physics and allows the exploration of a large range of parameters . we find that typical source parameters of young snrs should result in  acceleration at the forward shock , but yield near test - particle conditions at the reverse shock if the magnetic field is as low as expected from the ejecta expansion .",
    "when cosmic ray production is efficient , shock _ heating _ is linked to particle _ acceleration _ and thus to the broad - band photon emission from energetic electrons and ions .",
    "the high energy electrons produce both radio and x - ray synchrotron and this will be included in future work .",
    "in addition to a possible nonthermal synchrotron component , regions undergoing strong acceleration should exhibit stronger and lower temperature thermal emission , while regions with little acceleration should be fainter and at a higher temperature .",
    "also , other complications ( e.g. , the variation of the ambient magnetic field orientation ( reynolds @xcite ) , shock interactions with clouds and dense knots , etc . ) influence the full modeling of snrs . the spatially resolved spectra from the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "satellites should greatly aid the investigation of these and other effects ."
