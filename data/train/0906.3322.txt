    "[ sec : intr ] sterile neutrinos are hypothetical additions to the standard model of particle physics .",
    "they are right handed , neutral leptons which interact only via gravity , which earns them the `` sterile '' prefix , contrary to the active neutrinos which also participate in the weak interaction .",
    "gravity aside , sterile neutrinos also can interact with the active neutrinos via the quantum mechanical phenomenon of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this behaviour has been investigated by the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( @xcite ) and the miniboone experiment ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , no concrete evidence was convincingly found to suggest the existence , or non - existence , of sterile neutrinos from the disappearance of active neutrinos .",
    "the basis of some appeals to sterile neutrinos are for aesthetic reasons , since the active neutrinos are entirely left - handed ; and others make use of them in the so called `` see - saw mechanism '' which can give rise to the small masses of the active neutrinos ( @xcite ) . here we make no claims of a deeper theory for sterile neutrinos , but rather continue to investigate a startling coincidence .    a recent analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by @xcite has demonstrated that the acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum as measured by wmap ( @xcite ) and acbar ( @xcite ) can convincingly be generated by a single , thermal ( by virtue of neutrino oscillations in the early universe ) sterile neutrino ( sn ) with mass @xmath2 .",
    "this sn is a straight substitution for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) of the concordance cosmological model ( @xcite ) , such that @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the spectral index @xmath5 .",
    "however , whereas the unknown cdm particle can condense and form structures on virtually any scale , which puts it at odds with certain observations - like the lack of substructure as compared to the cosmological n - body simulations ( @xcite ) and the existence of dm cores in galaxy halos ( @xcite ) - the hot sn free streams out of galaxies .",
    "this makes it a non - starter as a traditional dark matter candidate , since it would render spiral galaxies ( like the milky way ) and dwarf galaxies ( like draco and ursa minor ) incapable of retaining their stars .",
    "fortunately , there is a well studied alternative to the standard lore of gravity called modified newtonian dynamics ( or mond ; see @xcite for reviews ) which has an uncanny knack of predicting the dynamics of galaxies from a simple relation using only the baryonic matter density .",
    "the paradigm of mond introduces a new physical constant with dimensions of acceleration , @xmath6 , around and below which dynamics do not follow from standard newtonian theory .",
    "in particular , the true modulus of gravity , @xmath7 , is not linearly related to the newtonian gravity , @xmath8 , but instead    g = g_n this ensures adherence to two critical axioms : that gravity is newtonian in regions of strong gravity , and that when @xmath9 , @xmath10 meaning rotation curves are flat at the periphery of spiral galaxies .    the additional gravity afforded by mond ,",
    "replaces the need for dm in dwarf spheroidals ( @xcite ) , spiral ( e.g. @xcite ) and x - ray dim elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) often with remarkable accuracy .",
    "furthermore , rotation curves of tidal dwarf galaxies have been observed by @xcite and the independent analysis by @xcite and @xcite reveal not only their consistency with mond ( with zero adjusted parameters ) , but also constitutes a direct falsification of dark matter being made only of cdm in galaxies : assuming the data are reliable .",
    "what is more , @xcite have advocated that the milky way s dwarf spheroidal galaxies are also tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "this convincing demonstration of mond s predictive ability does not , however , extend to the realms of clusters of galaxies .",
    "an obvious difference between galaxies and clusters of galaxies is simply the scale involved .",
    "if a typical galaxy is one or two tens of @xmath11 across , clusters have accurate measurements of the gravitational potential ( through the intracluster medium or weak gravitational lensing ) on scales ten times that and therefore volumes many thousand times greater .",
    "studies of the dynamics of groups and clusters in mond ( e.g. @xcite ) have all shown that there is a huge central mass deficit and @xcite demonstrated that active neutrinos , even at the experimental maximum ( @xmath12 ) , can not clump densely enough .",
    "a more plausible solution is the @xmath0 sn proposed by @xcite to fit the first three peaks of the cmb .",
    "the feasible particle mass of sn is fully determined by fitting the cmb power spectrum , and there is virtually no freedom available above 5% of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "it is the particle mass , and particle mass alone , that sets the properties of the sns in clusters and galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is a highly intriguing corollary that the mass required to match the cmb is in the tiny range of neutrino masses ( perhaps @xmath13 ) that can both free stream out of galaxies ( mond does not require any dm in galaxies ) and clump densely enough in galaxy clusters to account for the serious mass deficit exposed there .",
    "we now have the basis of a predictive cosmological model , where we have made two positive trades .",
    "firstly we exchange newtonian dynamics for modified newtonian dynamics , which helps explain in detail the origin of the mass discrepancy in all galaxies , and with fewer freedoms than the often contrived cdm halos ( as demonstrated by @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , we swap cdm for an @xmath0 sn .",
    "the added bonus of sns over cdm , is that knowing only the particle mass gives fixed predictions for the cmb and for structure formation ( with a small dependence on the @xmath14-function in only the latter case ) .    in the very early universe , neutrino decoupling (",
    "both active and sterile ) occurs at a temperature of @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the @xmath0 sns ( as well as the sub @xmath16 active neutrinos ) are ultra - relativistic during decoupling , which freezes in their fermi - dirac distribution and their cosmological abundance is fixed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "typical cdm candidates , like 100  @xmath17 neutralinos ( e.g. @xcite ) or @xmath18 sns ( see the review by @xcite ) are non - relativistic during decoupling , and self - annihilations must be used to tune the cosmological abundance .",
    "this applies to all cdm candidates which means knowing the mass of a cdm particle tells us the mass and not the cosmological abundance .",
    "free parameters , like the interaction cross - section , must explain why they have the correct cosmological abundance .",
    "in addition , while searching for an explanation of the anomalous low energy excess of electron neutrinos observed by the miniboone experiment , @xcite found agreement with the data by postulating a perfectly plausible renormalisation of the original flux of muon - neutrinos and oscillations ( that are energy dependent ) from electron neutrinos to @xmath19 sns .",
    "this hypothesis clearly warrants further investigation , and will be testable with the t2k neutrino experiment ( @xcite ) which will have a near detector at @xmath20 giving it a similar l / e ( e being neutrino energy ) as miniboone ( m. laveder , private communication ) .    in this paper , we seek to investigate the @xmath0 sn s influence in clusters of galaxies in mond . primarily , we need to ascertain that every cluster has an equilibrium distribution of neutrinos that can account for all the gravitating mass .",
    "this is by no means guaranteed since there is a maximum density set by the tremaine - gunn limit ( @xcite ; see  [ sec : psc ] ) depending on the velocity dispersion of neutrinos and the mass of an individual particle .",
    "if the required density of the equilibrium models exceed the tremaine - gunn limit ( or if the required @xmath21 of the bcg to keep the sn density below the tremaine - gunn limit is too high ) , they would be excluded . to this end",
    "we have taken a relatively large sample of @xmath1 relaxed galaxy groups and clusters to gauge their consistency with the missing mass problem of clusters of galaxies in mond .",
    "we take the temperature and density profiles of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in 7 clusters of galaxies with temperatures in the range of @xmath22 from the sample of @xcite , a further 13 groups of galaxies from the sample of @xcite , the cluster a  2589 from @xcite and 3 x - ray bright , isolated early type galaxies from the sample of @xcite .",
    "this covers the full sample used in @xcite , but in addition , we make an analysis of the two clusters comprising the bullet cluster ( @xcite ) working from the nfw halos fitted to the weak - lensing convergence map .",
    "we also take a fitted nfw profile for the cluster a  1689 from the strong lensing analysis of @xcite , take 3 estimates for the density profile of the coma cluster ( @xcite ) , a pair of clusters in the lynx field ( @xcite ) and the fossil group rxj  1416 ( @xcite ) .    for the @xcite sample , we only had x - ray data for 10 of the 13 , so for the other 3 ( a  2717 , ic  1860 , ms  1160 ) we started from their fitted nfw ( @xcite ) profiles and included the brightest cluster galaxy .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors give fully analytical descriptions of the icm temperature and density allowing us to solve the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to give the dynamical mass of each cluster ( see  [ sec : solv ] ) .",
    "similarly for the groups of galaxies , we were provided with ( d. buote private communication ) high resolution data that gives the icm density and temperature as functions of radius .",
    "we fitted @xmath23-models to the icm density and have fitted the same analytical models defined in @xcite to the temperature .",
    "these models are rather sophistocated , many parameter models that maximise the accuracy of the fits .",
    "the masses of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are taken either from the @xcite k - band luminosity estimates , the observations of @xcite or from k - band magnitudes on the _ ned _ database as per @xcite .",
    "naturally , there are errors associated with the best fit density and temperature profiles , which we do not explicitly investigate here .",
    "it is enough to say that the observational uncertainties surrounding the newtonian dynamical mass ( from which everything is deduced ) are no larger than the uncertainties in the triaxiality of the cluster or the interpolating function used to find the mondian dynamical mass , so we waste little time debating them .",
    "moreover , we use a sample containing @xmath1 of some of the most relaxed systems so that a general consensus can be reached .",
    "[ sec : solv ]      the density of @xmath0 sns ( or any dm candidate ) in mondian clusters of galaxies required to provide hydrostatic equilibrium of the icm is given by the following steps , as per @xcite .",
    "firstly , we take the observed density and temperature of the icm , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , and numerically take their logarithmic derivative with respect to radius to find the true gravity as a function of radius [ eqn : grav ] g(r)=-kt_x(r ) wm_pr , where @xmath26 is the mean molecular weight of the icm .",
    "the gravity simply is related to the total mond enclosed mass by [ eqn : mm ] m_m(r)=r^2g^-1g(r)(g / a_o ) , and the interpolating function is the simple one [ eqn : fb ] ( g / a_o)=g / a_o 1+g / a_o , ( see @xcite for a discussion of how it fares in spirals ) .",
    "this single line is the only stage at which mond is involved .    after subtracting the mass of the icm ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "we are left with the sn mass distribution and the unsubtracted bcg , @xmath28 , where the mass of the brightest cluster galaxy ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the 1.15 , which is of virtually no consequence , multiplies the icm mass to include the contribution of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "we invert this to give the sn density , there we ignore the bcg until later , although it is vitally important , for reasons that will become obvious later .",
    "[ eqn : rhonu1 ] _ _",
    "s(r)=(4r^2)^-1d drm__s(r ) .      at this point",
    "we have a deduced density of sns in a cluster of given temperature profile : at least it is the density exactly required for hydrostatic equilibrium of the icm ( or in the case of lensing , to create the observed convergence map ) .",
    "in addition to this constraint , there is an equation for hydrostatic equilibrium of the sns themselves , which is crucial to this analysis .",
    "this equation invokes the equation of state of neutrinos ( active or sterile ; see e.g. @xcite ) and what this gives us are equations that define the density and pressure of a partially degenerate neutrino gas , coupled via the hydrostatic equilibrium relation [ eqn : hyd ] d drp__s=-__s(r)g(r ) .    to express the density ,",
    "we start with the equilibrium occupation number [ eqn : on ] f=1 exp(x-)+1 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the ratios of neutrino energy and chemical potential to temperature .",
    "a large positive or negative @xmath31 denotes strong degeneracy or non - degeneracy respectively . from this",
    "we find the phase space density [ eqn : ps ] n = g_h^-3m^4__sf . here",
    ", @xmath32 is planck s constant and @xmath33=2 takes into account the anti - particles , whilst remembering that neutrinos have only a solitary helicity state .",
    "one immediately sees that there is an absolute upper limit to the allowed density of sns in phase - space , corresponding to full degeneracy ( @xmath34 ) and known as the pauli limit .",
    "the starting momentum distribution of neutrinos in the early universe corresponds to half this limit .",
    "it should be clear here that in groups and clusters of galaxies , sns of @xmath0 mass are non - relativistic since they are travelling at velocities of the order 100 - 1000@xmath35 ( e.g. fig  [ fig : c1 ] central panels ) .",
    "therefore , neutrino energy is related to momentum by @xmath36 .",
    "the number density of neutrinos is given by @xmath37 and multiplying this by neutrino mass ( @xmath2 ) , converting momentum to energy and temperature to velocity dispersion ( @xmath38 ) we find our equation for neutrino mass density [ eqn : rhonu ] _",
    "_ s(r)=4 g _",
    "m__s^4 _ _ s^3(r)f_1/2 ( ) , where the sn velocity dispersion and temperature are @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively and @xmath41 . in a non - relativistic neutrino gas , the pressure is equal to 2/3 the internal energy per unit volume ( @xmath42 ) giving    [ eqn : prenu ] p__s(r)=83 g _",
    "m__s^4 _ _ s^5(r)f_3/2 ( ) , where @xmath43 .",
    "it emerges that there are two variables here that must be set in order for the neutrinos to exist in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "primarily , @xmath44 , must be fixed so that the fixed density of eq  [ eqn : rhonu1 ] is matched by eq  [ eqn : rhonu ] . in case",
    "this is not obvious , we solve eq  [ eqn : rhonu ] for @xmath45 , for which there is a unique , continuous @xmath44 once the neutrino velocity dispersion is given .",
    "there is no independent method , apart from cosmological simulations of the collapse of the baryonic plus sn two - fluid mixture to estimate the chemical potential , @xmath31 , so we choose here to fit it to the data .",
    "whether detailed numerical simulations of cluster formation in a mond cosmology will reproduce this chemical potential will be a crucial test of the equilibrium models presented hereafter .",
    "this @xmath44 is then transfered to eq  [ eqn : prenu ] , and although @xmath44 is used to balance @xmath46 and ensure it remains unchanged when @xmath39 is varied , it influences the pressure , @xmath47 , non - linearly .",
    "secondly , eq  [ eqn : hyd ] must be satisfied , however , it is not satisfied if we make the assumption that the sterile neutrino velocity dispersion ( vd ) is identical to the icm vd . in general , there would be too much pressure because the neutrinos would be too hot for their given distribution .    _ a priori _ , there is no reason that the @xmath0 sns should have precisely the same temperature as the icm .",
    "both fluids are orbiting in the same gravitational potential , but there is no rapid exchange mechanism to bring them into mutual equilibrium , as there was in the very early universe .",
    "in fact , this is likely to be related to the formation epoch of the cluster , where the sn halos would have formed at relatively high redshift while the universe was more dense .",
    "later , the icm would have fallen into the deep potential well , created by the sn halo , and therefore it is logical that the icm should be hotter than the sns .",
    "in addition to probing the @xmath44 s fitted , numerical simulations of galaxy clusters in mond will , in time , be able to tell us if the difference in neutrino and icm vd is realistic .    from eqs  [ eqn : rhonu ] &",
    "[ eqn : prenu ] one can see that the sn vd influences the product of the density and gravity ( the right hand side of eq  [ eqn : hyd ] ) non - linearly with respect to the gradient of the neutrino pressure . essentially , to force the sn distribution into hydrostatic equilibrium , with its fixed density",
    ", we can modify the sn vd . however , as we shall discover in the next section , this can not be achieved by a simple scaling from the icm vd , but instead by solving for the neutrino vd , @xmath39 , as a unique , continuous function at every radius .      in principle , for hydrostatic equilibrium of the sns",
    ", we need @xmath48 and writing this out after some algebra gives us    [ eqn : nueq1 ] _",

    ", we can reduce this first order linear differential equation to    [ eqn : nueq2 ] _ _ s^2(r)=3 5 f_3/2(r)^-0.4_^r f_1/2 ( ) f_3/2()^0.6g()d .    to find pressure and density in the first instance ,",
    "we must submit a trial @xmath39 to eq  [ eqn : nueq2 ] : typically we try @xmath52 , where the icm vd is defined by _",
    "x = c ( kt_x w m_p)^1/2 . here",
    ", @xmath53 is the speed of light , @xmath54 is the icm temperature in @xmath55 , @xmath26 is again the mean molecular weight and @xmath56 is the mass energy of a proton . from the trial solution , we iterate rapidly towards convergence .",
    "the final @xmath57 gives hydrostatic equilibrium to better than 1 per cent at all radii and most importantly is unique - set only by the sn mass and its indirectly observed density from eq  [ eqn : rhonu1 ] .      [ sec : psc ] we now have a unique correlation between the density of sns and their velocity dispersions .",
    "this is important because these two variables define the phase space distribution of the sns , to which there is a fundamental limit .",
    "liouville s theorem states that ( in the absence of encounters ) flow in phase space is incompressible and that each element of phase - space density is conserved along the flow lines .",
    "however , this only applies to the fine - grained phase space density of an infinitesimal region .",
    "rather , for the observable , which is the coarse - grained ( macroscopic ) phase - space density , we simply must not exceed the maximum of the fine - grained one .",
    "thus , the sn phase - space density must not increase during collapse , from its starting value of @xmath58 ( which is half the pauli degeneracy limit ) , to its current maximum value of @xmath59^{-1.5}$ ] ( where we assume the velocity distribution is locally gaussian everywhere with dispersion @xmath39 ) .",
    "this limit is called the tremaine - gunn limit ( @xcite ; hereafter tg ) and rearranging it in terms of the critical density for an @xmath0 sn , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is obviously 1 second ) gives us    [ eqn : tg ] _ _ s , tg(r)=3.1510 ^ 6(__s(r ) c ) ^3pc^-3 . the important thing to bear in mind here is that this is the exact value of the tg limit because it is calculated from the unique , derived sn vd exactly necessary for hydrostatic equilibrium and not by assuming some relation between the icm and the neutrinos , as is often the case ( @xcite ) . therefore , we have the tg limit as a function of radius , since we know the exact value of the vd from solving eq  [ eqn : nueq2 ] .",
    "let us note however that departures from gaussianity in the velocity distribution could perhaps somewhat affect this physical upper limit on the sn density .",
    "the consequence of the tg limit is that , therefore if the density of sns required for cohesion of the cluster gas exceeds tg limit ( in particular at the centre ) then the mond plus @xmath0 sn hypothesis would be ruled out .",
    "in figs  [ fig : c1]-[fig : bul ] we present the densities , vds and enclosed mass profiles for the @xmath1 groups and clusters . in the left hand panels we plot the sn density ( solid line type ) , icm density ( dotted ) and the tg limit of the cluster ( dashed ) against radius . in the middle panels we plot both the observed icm ( dotted ) and",
    "the derived ( from eq  [ eqn : nueq2 ] ) sn ( solid ) vd as functions of radius . in the right hand panels",
    ", we plot each cluster s enclosed newtonian dynamical mass ( dashed ) , mond dynamical mass ( dot - dashed ) , bcg total mass with unity @xmath21 ( solid ) and icm mass ( dotted ) .",
    "there are a few salient features to observe : primarily , the sn vd ( or temperature ) is in most cases 20 - 50 per cent lower than the icm vd .",
    "the simple explanation , alluded to earlier , is that the sn halos presumably formed at relatively high redshift , through only their mutual gravitation . on the other hand , the icm fell from large distances , through the already present , deep potential well of the sns and thus had greater potential energy to transfer to kinetic energy , although this still has to be demonstrated with numerical simulations .",
    "taking a closer look at the sn densities and vds , they have conspicuous kinks around 20 - 30  @xmath11 .",
    "this radius , @xmath63 , is where the density reaches the tg limit , .",
    "if no phase space limit existed , the sn density would continue to increase towards the pauli limit and the neutrino equation of state would begin to substantially change from non - degeneracy ( large negative @xmath31 ) @xmath64 to the degenerate one ( large positive @xmath31 ) @xmath65 ( where the tg limit occurs at @xmath66 ) .",
    "however , since we must adhere to the tg limit , we impose it by making the density equal to the tg limit . the density and vd both increase towards the centre as they must conform to the duel constraints of remaining at the tg limit and satisfying hydrostatic equilibrium . alternatively ,",
    "if we had ignored the tg limit , the vd would have crashed towards the centre of the cluster ; as less classical pressure would be required to prop up the sn halo .",
    "this is simply because gradually more fermi pressure would be available .",
    "it is this behaviour that causes the kink since we force the density to be equal to the tg limit , the required vd for hydrostatic equilibrium must rise , whereas it was falling prior to this .",
    "since the sn halo of every group and cluster reaches the tg limit at the centre when there is still a discrepancy between the central sn density and the required total density for hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas , the bcg plays a crucial role in determining how satisfactory our @xmath0 sn hypothesis is .",
    "if no bcg existed in any of our clusters , they would immediately fail .",
    "we know the luminosity of most bcgs in the k - band which gives an excellent indication of mass ( see e.g. @xcite ) and we know a few in other bands ( b , v , r ) or not at all .",
    "therefore , we must modify the @xmath67 ( given in table  1 ) to exactly match @xmath68 at @xmath63 , which basically means the bcg is picking up all the `` slack '' left when the sn reaches the tg limit and can no longer account for the full dynamical mass .",
    "there are some points to bear in mind , firstly the highest @xmath67 used was 1.2 and the lowest 0.1 . in the latter case , of a very low @xmath67 , this can be due to the total luminosity not being enclosed by @xmath63 which is often @xmath69 ) . in the case of @xmath70 ,",
    "this can be considered a fitting parameter , since there is no freedom in the cluster to have a @xmath67 lower than the value used because the sn density reaches the tg limit at the centre of every cluster .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath67 can not be significantly larger or it would be in disagreement with the typical @xmath67 demonstrated by @xcite . in the cases",
    "where @xmath71 it need not be considered a fitting parameter , since there is freedom for the @xmath67 to be larger and simply for the sn to be lower .",
    "nevertheless , the tg limit will still be reached in every cluster , the only difference will be that if we are underestimating the bcg mass then @xmath63 will simply be lower for that particular cluster .",
    "the only reason we fix the density to be equal to the tg limit for all radii smaller than @xmath63 is to highlight the maximum amount of luminosity the bcg could lose ( e.g. if observations are incorrect ) and still provide the central density required .    generally , it is interesting to note that the sn halos needed to fit galaxy clusters here have a density slope similar to that of the icm in the central parts , but becoming sharper at intermediate distance , which is accompanied by a relatively flat velocity dispersion . at the edges of the clusters , the icm density becomes larger than the sn density ( which falls to zero ) and there is an apparent sharp decrease of the sterile neutrino velocity dispersion to zero also .",
    "this is merely a numerical artefact of the sterile neutrino density being set to zero at the edges of clusters , under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "since the sterile neutrino density will in reality fall to a very small number , but still greater than zero , the velocity dispersion will actually be isothermal , as we would expect .",
    "below we discuss some pertinent observations about individual groups or clusters .",
    "[ sec : bul ] analysis of the cmb strongly favours the hypothesis that non - baryonic dm exists in the universe , and the bullet cluster ( @xcite ) compounds it ( although @xcite has suggested that the dm of clusters could be ultra cold and collisionless clumps of molecular gas which would satisfy the constraint of this particular cluster ) .",
    "as two giant galaxy clusters crashed into each other at incredible speed ( @xcite , but see also @xcite for why this might pose a problem for @xmath72 ) , mutual ram pressure from the 2 icms dragged one another out of the clusters leaving only the galaxies and dm to pass through and emerge on the opposite sides on the sky .",
    "a weak - lensing reconstruction required two dm halos to overlay the positions of the galaxies with nfw parameters for the main and sub cluster respectively - @xmath73 , @xmath74mpc and concentrations @xmath75 .    in this case , where we are directly given the newtonian mass profile , we begin the procedure at eq  [ eqn : mm ] and follow the same steps . as with the other clusters , in fig  [ fig : bul ]",
    "we show that these two clusters both reach the tg limit smoothly at the centre .",
    "however , notice we must add a @xmath76 stellar mass to the sub cluster ( labeled `` bullet 2 '' ) to cover the dynamical mass in the central @xmath77 , which is very significant .",
    "the stellar mass quoted in @xcite at the weak - lensing peak of the sub cluster is @xmath78 within 100  @xmath11 , from i - band observations assuming a @xmath79 of 2 .",
    "we need only add a trivial stellar mass of @xmath80 to the main cluster , which is interesting since one can see from the left hand panel of fig  1 from @xcite that there is no obvious bcg candidate associated with it .",
    "in fact , the two giant ellipticals of the main cluster highlighted by @xcite are roughly 50  @xmath11 ( to the northern one ) and 75  @xmath11 ( to the eastern one ) from the lensing peak , but can easily offer the necessary stellar mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the centre of the bcg of the sub cluster is only roughly 25  @xmath11 from the lensing peak and significant light is spilling over within 10  @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , since bcgs usually dominate the stellar mass in the central 100  @xmath11 of clusters , the majority of the @xmath81 is likely associated with it , making the @xmath76 plausible .",
    "notice also that the @xmath76 is not required within @xmath82 , but rather by @xmath77 . within @xmath82",
    "less than @xmath83 is required .",
    "another intriguing point about bcg masses is the one used for the group rgh  80 , which has two equally massive central galaxies : ngc  5098a and ngc  5098b with @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively . in our previous paper ( @xcite )",
    "we were only interested in the central @xmath86 , therefore , were able to combine the two galaxy luminosities together .",
    "however , only one of the galaxies is at the very centre ( see fig  9 of @xcite or fig  1 of @xcite ) , and the other has a projected separation of around @xmath87 and possibly a considerable line of sight distance . before removing the second galaxy ,",
    "the tg limit was considerably larger than the maximum central density , but after discounting it , the tg limit is reached at @xmath88 .",
    "we found no galaxy luminosities for the two clusters a  1689 and a  2390 , but they require bcgs with total masses of at least @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively , which is a prediction of this model .",
    "interestingly , a  1689 has been used extensively to argue against cdm by @xcite because the observed nfw concentration parameter is considerably larger than that expected from cosmological simulations .",
    "we find the equilibrium model with @xmath0 sns nicely reaches the tg limit at @xmath88 , even though it has one of the highest central sn densities of all our sample .",
    "the two clusters in the lynx field are in the process of merging ( like the bullet cluster ) and thus the mass profiles are potentially overlapping .",
    "nevertheless , their offset seems to be sufficiently large to get a reasonable estimate from weak lensing and this has also been sanity checked with x - ray hydrodynamics ( @xcite ) .",
    "both the larger cluster and smaller cluster are fitted with the same nfw profile : @xmath91 , @xmath92mpc and concentration @xmath93 .",
    "the galaxy luminosities within 500  @xmath11 of each of the two lensing peaks are 1.5 and 0.8@xmath94 in the b - band .",
    "we require @xmath95 for each bcg , which is easy affordable by the luminosity of both clusters because typical b - band @xmath21s can range between 5 and 10 .",
    "the historical significance of the coma cluster with respect to the dark matter problem is probably far more significant than its scientific significance in this present case , but we include it out of curiosity .",
    "it was originally analysed in mond by @xcite and was actually concluded to be more or less consistent with mond , although the galaxies required radially biased orbits and the acceleration constant , @xmath96 had to be increased by at least a factor of 2 from the one used here .",
    "the problem with coma is that it is not particularly relaxed and also its sphericity is questionable .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that there is ongoing merging , which makes measurements of the central mass profile uncertain .",
    "therefore , the only way to get a decent estimate of the dark halo of coma is to use weak lensing ( like we have done with the bullet cluster ) , but even then the assumption of spherical symmetry is dubious .",
    "the best study of coma was performed by @xcite , but unfortunately found only a rather speculative nfw profile of @xmath97 and @xmath98 with no prior on the concentration parameter ( found to be @xmath99 ) . with a prior on the concentration parameter ( set",
    "to be @xmath100 ) they found @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "finally , we added an estimate from @xcite : @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the mass of the central galaxy would need to be @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively for the three cases .",
    "the k - band luminosity of the central galaxy in coma is @xmath108 , so there is plenty galactic mass to supply what is needed .",
    "we included one fossil group rxj  1416 in the sample since it has a very minor galaxy component ( aside from the bcg ) .",
    "@xcite fitted an nfw profile to x - ray data from chandra and xmmn with parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 and we used it to infer the necessary @xmath21 of the bcg which has luminosity @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath113 need only be 1.2 , whereas 5 is a typical value for an old stellar population in that band .",
    "so here again , as with several of the other massive systems , the full luminosity of the bcg is not required although the sn halo reaches the tg limit at the centre . this might be because the bcg is extended and only a fraction of the light is enclosed within 20 or 30@xmath114 ( where the sn halo reaches the tg limit ) .",
    "alternatively , if we used the full mass of the bcg , the sn density would simply reach the tg limit at a smaller radius .",
    "[ sec : n4125 ] these two x - ray bright early type galaxies were taken from the sample of @xcite .",
    "interestingly from the point of view of sns in galaxies ( which could disrupt the good fits to rotation curves i.e. the basis of mond ) their dynamical masses are comfortably covered by the bcg mass everywhere . from their density figures",
    "you can see the sns are at the tg limit everywhere , but the sns make virtually no impact on their mass profiles .",
    "in fact , if the sn density for ngc  4125 was @xmath115 all the way to the centre from 10  @xmath11 , the enclosed mass of sns would be @xmath116 in comparison to roughly @xmath80 for the bcg ( at that radius ) , which is a factor of 30 .",
    "therefore , there is no reason to believe that sns will influence the internal dynamics of individual galaxies in a meaningful way .",
    "[ sec : n720 ] these are the two most problematic groups .",
    "@xcite observed that the twisting of x - ray isophotes around the elliptical galaxy ngc  720 compared to the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxy ( which outweighs the gas by more than two orders of magnitude ) could only be compatible with the presence of dm at least four times the galaxy mass ( by the edge of the galaxy ) .",
    "this sn halo would have an ellipticity distinct to that of the galaxy and the gas would trace the superimposed potential , hence generating the twisting isophotes .",
    "the luminosity of ngc  720 is @xmath117 and requires @xmath118 which is the high end of the scale for the kroupa imf of an old stellar population .",
    "the sns have reached the tg limit by 30@xmath114 , so can not contribute any more mass .",
    "the problem is that ngc  720 has a relatively young stellar population , although there is a age gradient from @xmath119 in the centre to @xmath120 by @xmath121 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to significant systematic uncertainty in constraining the @xmath67 , which is given as @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the salpeter and kroupa imf respectively .",
    "a recent re - evaluation with data of superior resolution ( d. buote private communication ) puts the kroupa value at @xmath124 ( meaning the salpeter value will be somewhat larger ) , but this still falls well short of the necessary galactic mass .",
    "this could be a serious problem if the low @xmath67 could be confirmed , but for now it is a prediction of this model that the true @xmath67 ( when the correct imf , age distribution and merger history are taken into account ) will be close to 1.2 .",
    "ngc  720 is not the only system that is very sensitive to the observations .",
    "ngc  1550 was studied by @xcite with both chandra and xmm - newton and both sets of temperature data are plotted in their fig  3 .",
    "later it was observed again by @xcite using xmm - newton , in a study which suggested there was evidence for a recent merger .",
    "if we use either set of xmm - newton data points , the @xmath67 would need to be at least 1.6 , whereas if we only subscribe to the chandra data , the @xmath67 need only be 1.2 . follow up observations could provide a very strong test of the model , but chandra s greater spatial resolution makes it the more reliable data set .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that @xmath0 sns were required to fit the first three acoustic peaks of the cmb and that 2 species of @xmath125 sns were totally inadequate ( as were three @xmath126 ordinary neutrinos ) .",
    "there was also very little freedom beyond 5 per cent of @xmath0 , without introducing unjustified free parameters .    for further instruction to the importance of the sn mass to be @xmath0 , we calculated the @xmath67 necessary to produce an equilibrium sn distribution in the group eso-306 ( which is by no means the most constraining ) in two different scenarios .",
    "firstly , trying a @xmath127 sn and secondly keeping an @xmath0 sn mass but using the standard @xmath14-function of mond : where instead of using eq  [ eqn : fb ] we try @xmath128 .",
    "whereas using the simple @xmath14-function and an @xmath0 sn requires @xmath129 , the @xmath127 sn requires @xmath130 and the standard @xmath14-function would need 1.4 .",
    "given that these sorts of high @xmath67 would be the rule , rather than the exception , they seem incompatible with stellar population synthesis models like those of @xcite .",
    "this evidence in favour of the simple @xmath14-function is not an isolated case . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the simple function was prefered from a fit to the milky way s rotation curve ( a high surface brightness galaxy ) as was the case in the large sample of high surface brightness galaxies carried out by @xcite .",
    "this preference is also being found by an ongoing study of ultra high resolution rotation curves observed by the things ( @xcite ) collaboration ( g. gentile , private communication ) .",
    "the main problem with the simple function is that it can not be used all the way to the strong gravity regime . in particular",
    ", it would produce too high a modification in the inner solar system , which is excluded , for example , by measures of the perihelion precession of mercury .",
    "the solution is to use a @xmath14-function that would rapidly interpolate between the simple and standard @xmath14 for very large values of the gravitational acceleration , but this is not applicable here .",
    "it is an encouraging result that the @xmath0 sns have unique and continuous equilibrium models for such a large dynamic range of cluster properties , but what is remarkable is that at the centre of every cluster , the tg limit is reached . for each given cluster",
    ", there is a specific , maximum density profile that can exist in equilibrium : a good example being ngc  5129 ( in fig  [ fig : c3 ] ) , which must have the maximum allowed density from @xmath131 for the sn halo to both be in hydrostatic equilibrium and provide the correct dynamical mass as measured by the icm properties .",
    "accordingly , it is the tg limit and the degenerate properties of the sns ( since they are fermions ) that sets the dynamical properties of all clusters .",
    "no relation , even remotely like this exists if the cluster dm is cold or non - fermionic .",
    "it is apparent from the examples of ngc  4125 and ngc  6482 ( see  [ sec : n4125 ] ) that sns will mostly not affect the dynamics of galaxies . @xcite",
    "have shown that a constant density of @xmath132 was allowed in the mond fits to the rotation curves of ursa major galaxies .",
    "this magnitude of sn density is typically found within @xmath133 in the very massive clusters and within @xmath134 from the centre of groups . at the centre of clusters ,",
    "the situation is obviously different , but stable spiral galaxies are never present there since tides would rip them apart before they fall to the centre .",
    "therefore , this will not disturb the mond tully - fisher relation since field spirals should be far from any sn halos .",
    "however , sns are required to exist in the centres of some very massive ellipticals .",
    "this is clear from the right hand panels of the enclosed mass profiles of the clusters a  478 ( fig  [ fig : c1 ] ) , a  907 and others . in these figures",
    "one can see the mass of the bcg ( the solid line ) is smaller than the mond enclosed mass .",
    "thus , a considerable mass of sns is required inside the limits of the stellar orbits , but always significantly less than the mass in stars .      in its original form",
    ", mond should be able to explain all galaxy dynamics without dark matter .",
    "although rotation curves have always yielded excellent results , the data for lensing studies ( beginning with @xcite ) of individual galaxies has not been as promising .",
    "for instance @xcite show that the weak - lensing of single , isolated galaxies is perfectly compatible with mond up to a particular galaxy luminosity ( from @xmath135 ) .",
    "thereafter , the lensing data implies the need for dm , which is exactly as we might expect if these more luminous galaxies are embedded in a low density but extended sn halo ( akin to those in the @xcite sample , see  [ sec : n4125 ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the study by @xcite whereby the integrated mass along the line of sight is entangled with the stellar mass .",
    "this makes lensing studies of individual early - type galaxies in mond significantly inferior to those using icm , or even globular clusters ( @xcite ) , planetary nebulae ( @xcite ) and satellite galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown explicitly how to calculate the equilibrium configurations of neutrinos in mondian galaxy clusters . the density of sterile neutrinos is fixed by the properties of the icm ( or the observed lensing map ) , but derivation of the sterile neutrino velocity dispersion allows a specific density profile to exist in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we have presented the detailed properties of @xmath1 typical galaxy groups and clusters over a wide range of masses and temperatures ( and even redshift vis - a - vis the bullet cluster , the lynx cluster and a  1689 ) and have shown that not only can we elucidate velocity dispersion profiles that allow the sterile neutrinos to exist in hydrostatic equilibrium , but also that the tremaine - gunn limit sets the central density .",
    "it would appear to be a very strong coincidence that by doing little more than fixing the mass of a sterile neutrino to be @xmath0 , we can serendipitously , explain the formation of the acoustic peaks in the cmb and specify the _",
    "exact _ properties of systems that require dm in mond .",
    "in particular , regardless of cluster mass , the velocity dispersion of sterile neutrinos necessary to impose hydrostatic equilibrium allows the density to reach its maximum ( which is a function of both sterile neutrino particle mass , velocity dispersion and cluster mass indirectly ) at the centre of the cluster .",
    "the only stipulation is whether these equilibrium configurations are stable , which should be the next check .    out of the @xmath1 systems",
    ", there are two which need to be monitored .",
    "ngc  720 requires a k - band mass - to - light ratio of 1.2 , which is possible for an old stellar population , but the current best population synthesis model suggests @xmath124 .",
    "estimates of stellar masses are notoriously fraught with difficulties ( @xcite ) , but this is a potential problem . ngc  1550 ( discussed alongside ngc  720 in  [ sec : n720 ] ) can only reproduce the temperature observed from chandra ; if the xmm - newton data are used , the k - band mass - to - light ratio of the central galaxy is too high . from this study , it is clear that the strongest tests of the @xmath0 sterile neutrino model comes not from the rich clusters , but rather from smaller groups or individual galaxies with bright x - ray halos .    in a similar sense to how the nfw density profile deduced from n - body simulations of cdm structure formation",
    "have been shown to be inadequate descriptions of some galaxy and galaxy cluster dm halos ( @xcite ) we suggest that our highly regular density and velocity dispersion profiles shown in figs  [ fig : c1]-[fig : bul ] must be used to judge the consistency of simulated structure growth in mond cosmological simulations . presumably , it is guaranteed that the objects that condense out of the background will reach the tremaine - gunn limit at the centre ( which makes it so alluring that all the clusters studied here do ) , but it is not certain that the phase space densities will fall with radius in the manner shown here , nor that the chemical potential will have the correct values .    given that we fit the cmb and have these interesting results for clusters of galaxies , another crucial test of this model ( after checking stability ) will be to see if mond n - body cosmological simulations , with @xmath0 sterile neutrinos can form structures resembling those shown here and match the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xcite computed the matter power spectrum with mond - like gravity and three @xmath136 active neutrinos ( the @xmath96 used was @xmath137 larger than the one used typically to fit rotations curves and used here ) and showed the extra matter density from the neutrinos ( @xmath138 compared to @xmath139 ) coupled with the mond gravity could come relatively close to providing a good match to the matter power spectrum measured by the sdss ( @xcite ) .",
    "the higher matter density provided by the sns ( @xmath140 and @xmath4 ) traded off with the smaller , more standard @xmath96 , could very well provide a superior fit to the matter power spectrum . to resolve this",
    "we need cosmological numerical simulations , which are still in their infancy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "relativistic mond theories beginning with teves ( @xcite , also see the review by @xcite ) and bstv ( @xcite ) , which led to new ideas like generalised einstein - aether ( see e.g. , @xcite ) are still highly complex and only address the galactic dark matter problem ( not the cluster , or cosmological dark matter problem ; nor the dark energy problem ) .",
    "therefore , one caveat we would add to our conclusions is that this cosmological model still requires dark energy in the same coincidental amount as @xmath72 .",
    "however , as elaborated upon in @xcite and @xcite , mond and dark energy must be two sides of the same coin that leads seamlessly to @xmath141 . there is some progress in this direction ( @xcite ) but it has not yet been convincingly or efficiently shown .",
