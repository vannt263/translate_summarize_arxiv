    "according to the @xmath17-dominated cold dark matter ( @xmath17cdm ) model , major mergers of galaxies are an important process in the formation of present - day massive galaxies . the merger rate of dark matter halos and galaxies as well as its evolution",
    "have now been widely studied with @xmath18body simulations and semi - analytical models @xcite .",
    "measuring the frequency of galaxy close pairs and galaxy merger rates thus provides powerful constraints on theories of galaxy formation and evolution . the galaxy merger fraction is often parameterized by a power law of the form @xmath19 .",
    "observational studies of galaxy merger rates using both close pairs and morphological approaches within the last decade have found a diverse range of @xmath20 values from @xmath21 to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may arise from the different sample selections across different redshift ranges , as well as from different procedures used to correct for the sample incompleteness .",
    "the relatively mild evolution of observed galaxy mergers found in the literature @xcite seems to be in contradiction to the rapid increase of halo merger rates with redshift predicted in @xmath18body numerical simulations where @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such comparison may not be adequate since the latter were focused on the merger histories of distinct halos which host one or multiple galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the mergers of subhalos in @xmath18body simulations offer a better analogy to the observed galaxy mergers . in a recent study using @xmath18body simulations ,",
    "@xcite find that the companion rate of subhalos increases mildly with redshift out to @xmath16 , consistent with the data presented in @xcite .    despite the successful agreement between pair counts of observed galaxies and subhalos in simulations , it is not yet clear whether low or mild evolution of the pair fraction and merger rate still holds for different types of galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic color distribution of galaxies has been shown to be bi - modal since @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is thus expected that the effects of interactions and mergers between various types of galaxies on their final products can be different .",
    "for example , wet mergers ( mergers between two gas - rich galaxies ) can trigger additional star formation @xcite , cause quasar activity @xcite and transform disk galaxies into ellipticals @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the so - called dry mergers ( mergers between two gas - poor galaxies ) may not involve dramatic changes in the star formation rate , but can play an important role in the stellar mass growth of massive red galaxies at the current epoch @xcite . in addition , the relative fraction of mixed pairs versus separation might yield clues on the effectiveness of a red galaxy to shut down the star formation even of other galaxies in its neighborhood . quantifying the merger rates of galaxies between different types",
    "is therefore an important step towards understanding how present day massive galaxies are built up .    while recently there have been several efforts attempting to estimate the merger rates of certain categories , they were mainly focused on red galaxies @xcite .",
    "yet no direct observational measurement of the relative abundances of wet , dry , and mixed mergers has been provided . despite",
    "that they have been explored in recent theoretical studies @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the evolution of the pair fractions for different types of galaxies and obtain the relative fraction of major merger rates among various types of mergers for the first time .",
    "we classify close galaxy pairs into three different categories ( blue - blue pairs ; red - red pairs ; mixed pairs ) based on galaxy colors . as a first approximation ,",
    "blue galaxies are gas - rich while red galaxies are gas - poor .",
    "we therefore calculate the merger rates of wet mergers , dry mergers , and mixed mergers using the number statistics from blue - blue pairs , red - red pairs and mixed pairs .",
    "there is however possible contamination of red gaseous and blue gas - poor galaxies in our analysis .",
    "recent studies of galaxy morphologies have suggested that about 20% of red galaxies appear to be either edge - on disks or dusty galaxies and hence are likely to be gas - rich @xcite . on the other hand , there also exist blue spheroidals that could be gas - poor , although these are relatively rare objects @xcite .",
    "since both cases of contamination discussed above affect only a minority of the red sequence and blue clouds respectively , classifying different types of mergers based on their colors should be a good approximation .",
    "the pair sample is constructed based on their rest - frame @xmath24-band luminosity @xmath25 as often used in the literature .",
    "while the stellar mass range of red and blue galaxies selected with fixed @xmath25 could be different , @xmath25 is shown to be a good tracer of dynamical mass for a wide range of hubble types @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we select major - merger candidates based on the ratio of @xmath25 regardless of the color difference .",
    "the galaxy sample at @xmath26 is taken from the deep2 redshift survey @xcite and team keck redshift survey in goods -",
    "we also supplement our low redshift sample ( z @xmath27 0.45 ) using the ssrs2 survey @xcite , millennium galaxy catalog ( hereafter mgc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cnoc2 redshift survey @xcite . the combined samples yield the largest number of kinematic pairs out to @xmath15 to date and enable study , for the first time , of galaxy merger rates for wet mergers , dry mergers and mixed mergers as a function of redshift .    in  2",
    ", we describe the selection of close pairs . in  3 , we present our results on the pair fractions for blue and red galaxies , as well as the derived merger rates for different merger categories .",
    "a discussion is given in  4 , followed by our conclusions in  5 . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmology : h@xmath28 = 100@xmath29  mpc@xmath10 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the hubble constant @xmath29 = 0.7 is adopted when calculating rest - frame magnitudes . unless indicated otherwise ,",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "close pairs are potential progenitors of merging galaxies and hence present an opportunity to study the different types of mergers before coalescence takes place .",
    "thanks to the high spectral resolution of deep2 ( @xmath32 30 ) and tkrs ( @xmath32 60 ) , we are able to select kinematic pairs at @xmath26 , which require accurate spectroscopic redshifts of both pair components in order to reduce the contamination by interlopers .",
    "three other redshifts surveys including galaxies at lower redshift ( @xmath33 ) - ssrs2 , mgc , and cnoc2 - are also added to our sample .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath24-band magnitudes ( ) and @xmath34 colors for deep2 galaxies at @xmath35 are derived in a similar way to that in @xcite . for galaxies with @xmath36 ,",
    "the rest - frame @xmath34 color is computed using the observed @xmath37 color , where @xmath38 is the @xmath39-band magnitude obtained from cfht / megacam observations for deep2 fields in 2004 and 2005 ( lin et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",

    "the values of @xmath42 are found to be close to 1.3 up to @xmath16 for either blue or red galaxies @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we therefore adopt @xmath43 to ensure that galaxies within the same range of the luminosity function are being selected .",
    "kinematic close pairs are then identified such that their projected separations satisfy 10 @xmath44 @xmath44 @xmath45 ( physical length ) and rest frame relative velocities less than 500 @xcite .",

    "the vertical dotted lines in each panel indicate the approximate bright and faint limit of @xmath47 corresponding to @xmath2 @xmath3 . it can be seen that the red galaxies are not complete in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath48 @xmath49 ) due to the @xmath50 cut in the deep2 sample .",
    "we will discuss how to deal with such incompleteness in  3.1 .",
    "for the low redshift samples , simple rest - frame color cuts @xmath51 ( in ab ) and @xmath52 ( in ab ) are applied to mgc and cnoc2 respectively . in fig .",

    "[ figcolor ] , there is a fairly good correlation between these colors .",
    "therefore the @xmath53 cut for mgc and the @xmath55 cut for cnoc2 can still provide good correspondence of blue and red galaxies at low - redshifts to the deep2 sample .",

    "blue - blue pairs , red - red pairs , and mixed pairs ( hereafter b - b , r - r , and mixed pairs respectively ) are classified according to the color combination of the pairs . in total , we have 218 b - b pairs , 122 r - r pairs , and 166 mixed pairs with 10 @xmath44 @xmath44 @xmath58 and @xmath44 500 from combined samples .      to measure the incompleteness of the deep2 survey and hence the selection function , we compared the sample with successful redshifts to all objects in the photometric catalog that satisfy the limiting magnitude and any photometric redshift cut .",
    "the selection function is expected to depend on an unknown and complex interplay among observables and intrinsic properties of objects . with data too limited to undertake multi - dimensional investigations of the selection function ,",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the selection function is separable in the different observed variables @xcite . by assuming that fluxes are the only observables correlated to the other observables of galaxies , we restrict the definition of the selection function to be @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the magnitude selection function",

    "[ figsf_1 ] ) of each galaxy is computed as the ratio of the number of galaxies with good redshift qualities to the total number of galaxies in the target catalog in both cases considering a magnitude bin of @xmath730.25 mag centered on the magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "the color selection function @xmath61(@xmath74 ) ( the middle panel of fig .",

    "similarly , the surface brightness selection function ( the right panel of fig . [ figsf_1 ] ) is performed within @xmath730.25 mag in @xmath75 and @xmath73 0.25 mag in @xmath69 .",
    "the geometric selection function @xmath63(@xmath76 ) is similar to magnitude selection function but has a localized effect .",

    "[ figsf_2 ] shows the distribution of @xmath63 .",
    "finally we use equation [ weight ] to compute the total selection function @xmath77 , which leads to the spectroscopic weight for each galaxy in deep2 as @xmath78 .",
    "besides the selection function for each individual galaxy , we also investigate the selection dependence on pair separation using analogous procedures adopted by @xcite . in principle , the target selection is unlikely to place slits on close pairs simultaneously since the slit orientations constrained to be less than @xmath79 degs from the slit mask orientation . in addition , we are not able to put slits on objects that are very close to each other because their separate spectra will overlap .",
    "the suppression of close pairs , however , is not a severe problem in deep2 because each field has been observed with two masks . to quantify this effect , we measure the angular separation of all pairs in the redshift catalog ( z - z pairs ) and in the target catalog ( p - p pairs ) respectively and then count the number of pairs ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) within each angular separation bin . while counting the pairs in the redshift catalog , each component of a pair",

    "[ figsf_2 ] ) .",
    "we repeat the above analysis for the tkrs sample except that the acs @xmath86 and @xmath87 colors are used when calculating the color selection function .",
    "the selection function and weights for ssrs2 , mgc , and cnoc2 samples are computed in the same manner as described in @xcite .",
    "we first compute the pair fraction , defined as the average number of companions per galaxy : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the total number of galaxies within the chosen absolute magnitude range , @xmath90 is the spectroscopic weight for the @xmath91th companion belonging to the @xmath92th galaxy , and @xmath93 is the angular selection weight for each pair as described in  2.2 . while the blue galaxy sample is volume - limited for the adopted magnitude range @xmath2 @xmath3 , because of the @xmath50 cut in the deep2 sample , lower luminosity red galaxies beyond @xmath16 are not contained in the sample . to estimate the missing fraction of galaxies , we extrapolated the derived red luminosity function of deep2 @xcite and calculated the expected total number of galaxies between -21 @xmath27 + @xmath41 @xmath27 -19 at @xmath11 .",
    "these predicted numbers are then compared to the predicted number of galaxies between -21 @xmath27 + @xmath41 @xmath27 @xmath94(24.1 ) , where @xmath94(24.1 ) represents the faint limit imposed by the apparent r=24.1 cut used by deep2 .",
    "the latter comprise @xmath32 42% from which we estimate that about 58% of the galaxies could be missing in the sample .",
    "therefore we apply a correction factor of 2.4 for each red companion at @xmath95 in addition to the usual spectroscopic and angular separation corrections .",

    "when considering all colors together , we find a minor amount of evolution with a power - law index of @xmath1 for the case of @xmath101 30 , and @xmath102 for the case of @xmath101 50 .",
    "these results are consistent with the value @xmath103 given in @xcite , which used a sample 7 times smaller .",
    "blue galaxies , however , have stronger evolution @xmath4 , meaning that the probability of blue galaxies having a blue companion is higher at higher redshift .",
    "red galaxies , on the other hand , have higher chance of being found in r - r pairs at lower redshifts than at high redshifts , as indicated by the negative power index ( @xmath5 ) . finally , , which measures the mixed pair fraction , is also found to decrease with increasing redshifts ( @xmath104 ) . except for the mixed pairs",
    ", there is very weak dependence of @xmath20 on the chosen @xmath45 , suggesting that our derived @xmath20 is not strongly affected by the incomplete sampling rate at small scales . on the other hand ,",
    "the significant change of @xmath20 for mixed pairs when varying @xmath45 may indicate a change in the environment that hosts mixed pairs over time .",
    "the evolutionary trends of blue and red galaxies can be understood as follows : the pair fraction is proportional to the galaxy number density times the integral at small scales of the real space 2-point correlation function .",
    "the galaxy correlation function is normally approximated by a power law @xmath105 at distances ranging from 0.1 to several mpc . under the assumption that the clustering strength at small scales follows the same power law ,",

    ", we obtain @xmath117 ( -0.48 ) for blue ( red ) galaxies by comparing the pair fraction at @xmath116 and @xmath118 using equation  [ f_pair ] .",
    "these values of @xmath20 are fully consistent with what we have found for kinematic pairs of both blue and red galaxies , indicating that the pair fraction evolution is a natural consequence of evolution of galaxy number density and galaxy clustering .",
    "while consistency with the overall number density and correlation function studies is encouraging , the close pairs we use here directly probe what is really happening on small scales ( ie .",
    "rather than an inward extrapolation of the correlation function ) .      here",
    "we define the galaxy major merger rates as the number of merger events involving at least one galaxy within @xmath119@xmath3 to merge with another galaxy with luminosity ratio between 4:1 and 1:4 per unit volume per gigayear .",
    "this quantity can be derived from the pair fraction together with the known galaxy number density and the assumption about the timescale of being pairs before final mergers .",
    "it is worth noting , however , the pair fraction in  3.1 is computed using pairs drawn from within a luminosity range of 2 mag .",
    "some true companions may fall outside the absolute magnitude range of our sample , while some selected companions have luminosity ratios outside the range of 4:1 to 1:4 . to account for both of these effects",
    ", we use the following equation to convert the pair fraction for the case of @xmath9630 into merger rates @xcite : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the timescale for close pairs to merge , @xmath122 denotes the fraction of galaxies in close pairs that will merge within @xmath121 , @xmath123 is the comoving number density of galaxies , and @xmath124 is the correction factor that accounts for the selection effect of companions due to the restricted luminosity range .",
    "the factor of 0.5 converts the number of merging galaxies into the number of merger events ( i.e. , on average , two close companions correspond to one galaxy pair and hence one merger ) .",
    "the smallest separation pairs with @xmath45 = 30 are the best tracers of future mergers , and hence our calculations below of merger rates are based on the pair statistics from pairs with @xmath45 = 30 .",
    "we adopt a crude value of @xmath121 = 0.5 gyr , as suggested by major merger simulations @xcite and c = 0.6 , by estimating the fraction of pairs that are closer than 30 in real 3-d space among those selected by 10 @xmath44 @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath27 500 .",
    "it is worth noting that the uncertainty of @xmath121 is at least a factor of 2 .",
    "here we make a simple assumption that @xmath121 is the same for all types of mergers .",
    "the motivation behind this is that the @xmath24-band light is a good tracer of dynamical mass @xcite and hence the merger timescales should be approximately similar for red - red , blue - blue , and mixed pairs when selected with a fixed @xmath47 range at a given redshift .",
    "the correction factor @xmath124 for wet and dry mergers is defined as @xmath125 where @xmath126 = -21 - @xmath41 , and @xmath127 = -19 - @xmath41 in our case .",

    "we follow equation ( 32 ) in @xcite :    @xmath153    where @xmath154 is the remnant fraction , @xmath155 gives the fraction of galaxies that will undergo mergers during the time interval @xmath121 , and @xmath156 corresponds to a look - back time of t = @xmath157 .",
    "adopting @xmath158 as used in  3.2 , and @xmath159 from the fit of the data for the case of @xmath45 = 30 , our result implies that 22% of today s galaxies with @xmath141 have experienced mergers with galaxies within the same luminosity range since @xmath15 .    in the second case which is a better probe of the major merger rate , equation  [ frem ] needs to be modified as : @xmath160 where the term @xmath161 accounts for the missed companions ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "since the factor @xmath124 is approximately 1 at all redshifts , we conclude that about 54% of @xmath141 galaxies have undergone a major merger since @xmath15 , but this depends sensitively on the assumed merger timescale .",
    "both estimates above of the remnant fraction are about 2 - 6 times greater than that reported in @xcite .",
    "the major cause of this difference can be traced to the different definitions of major mergers as well as the different choice of pair separations when calculating the remnant fraction .",
    "= 20 and by requiring both merger components to have @xmath2 @xmath3 . ]",
    "previous works have suggested that dry mergers are likely responsible for the growth of massive galaxies on the red sequence @xcite , because of the lack of blue galaxies massive enough to migrate from the blue cloud to the red sequence .",
    "moreover , there is observational evidence showing the nonnegligible amount of dry mergers occurring in the past 8 gyr ( van dokkum 2005 ; bell et al .",
    "2006a , white et al .",
    "2007 , although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as evidence from theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the implication of our merger studies on this topic .",
    "we have shown that at a given luminosity range , the merger events are always dominated by wet mergers , followed by mixed mergers , and then dry mergers in terms of the event rates over the redshift range @xmath162 .",
    "this is mainly because the number density of blue galaxies dominates the total galaxy population in the luminosity range we consider .",
    "however , given the fact that the pair fraction and merger rate also depend on the clustering properties of galaxies in addition to the galaxy number density , the probability of red galaxies having a red companion turns out to be comparable to the blue companion rate for blue galaxies at @xmath163 . at @xmath164 , becomes even greater than as shown in fig .",
    "[ fignc ] and table  [ tab1 ] . that is to say",
    ", the probability of mergers within the red sequence is greater than that within the blue cloud at low redshifts .",
    "we can compare our results to previous attempts at measuring the dry merger frequency .",
    "our derived average over @xmath165 is similar to the fraction of dry - merger candidates @xmath32 3% found by @xcite from the gems survey . in addition , our fitted dry pair fraction at @xmath148 is about 0.045 ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) , which is also in broad agreement with the companion fraction ( @xmath166 ) within the red sequence estimated by @xcite using nearby galaxy samples .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found very small merger rates for luminous red galaxies , on the order of @xmath167 gyr@xmath10gpc@xmath9 from the sdss luminous red galaxy sample ( lrg ) .",
    "their finding is about 23 times lower than our estimates of dry merger rates at @xmath12 and 7 times lower than ours at @xmath168.gyr@xmath10 while our results in table  [ tab1 ] are in @xmath8mpc@xmath10gyr@xmath10 .",
    "we adopt @xmath169 when doing comparisons . ]",
    "the major discrepancy can be attributed to the different luminosity ranges being sampled : their choice of faint - end magnitude is brighter than typical @xmath14 galaxies by almost 2 mag while ours is fainter than @xmath14 by 1 mag . since the luminosity function of red galaxies shows a strong decline towards the bright end , we expect that mergers occurring among luminous red galaxies should be much lower than that among less - luminous ones .",
    "this effect is also found by @xcite and @xcite .    in order to assess",
    "how much dry mergers with luminosity ratios less than 4:1 may contribute to the growth of massive red galaxies , we compute the following quantities , @xmath27 @xmath170@xmath171/@xmath172 , where @xmath27 @xmath170 is the average dry merger rate over @xmath173 , @xmath171 is the cosmic time since @xmath116 , and @xmath174 is the number density of red galaxies within a 2 mag bin centered on @xmath14 at @xmath118 .",
    "taking @xmath27 @xmath170 as 2 @xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath8mpc@xmath10gyr@xmath10 , @xmath171 as 8 gyr , and @xmath177 @xmath8mpc@xmath10 , we find that about 24% of present red galaxies have experienced dry mergers .",
    "our result is slightly lower than the 35% found by @xcite , mainly because they have assumed a constant dry merger rate over time while we find a decreasing rate of dry mergers with increasing redshift .",
    "the contribution of mixed mergers and wet mergers to the formation of red galaxies is less straightforward to constrain given the difficulty in handling how often and how soon the mixed and wet mergers transform the merger remnant into a red sequence galaxy . under the extreme assumption that both mixed mergers and wet mergers lead to the formation of red galaxies immediately , the fraction of present day red galaxies that have experienced mixed and wet mergers is roughly 36% and 71% respectively .",
    "these values are certainly over - estimated since not necessarily all remnants of mixed or wet mergers end up in the red sequence .",
    "we note that at a fixed luminosity , the stellar mass of red galaxies is systematically higher than that of blue galaxies ( see equation 1 of lin et al .",
    "2007 ) ; in other words , the stellar mass of the progenitors of dry mergers is larger than that of wet mergers or mixed mergers in our sample since we select the pairs based on the luminosity cut in both the blue cloud and red sequence .",
    "for example , the typical stellar mass of our selected blue galaxies is @xmath178 and that of our red galaxies is @xmath179 .",
    "hence , the merger remnant of these three types of mergers being considered in our sample will likely end up as red galaxies in different stellar mass regimes .",
    "a plausible scenario is that the star formation is quenched after the process of wet mergers and/or mixed mergers , resulting in the formation of some portion of the red galaxies with intermediate masses .",
    "the massive red galaxies are then built up through dry mergers between galaxies with intermediate masses at a later time since our results suggest that dry - mergers play an increasing role at lower redshifts .",
    "combining the deep2 , tkrs , mgc , cnoc2 , and ssrs2 catalogs , we study the redshift evolution of the pair fraction and major merger rates of wet , dry , and mixed mergers for galaxies with @xmath2 @xmath3 out to @xmath15 .",
    "the merger candidates are identified as close pairs based on their projected separation on the sky and relative line - of - sight velocities .",
    "wet , dry , and mixed mergers are classified according to the colors of the individual components in close pairs .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :      \\2 . the values of @xmath20",
    "depend on the color combination in close pairs .",
    "blue galaxies show slightly faster evolution in the blue companion rate with @xmath4 while red galaxies have had fewer red companions in the past as evidenced by the negative slope @xmath5 . on the other hand , @xmath104 for mixed pairs .",
    "the different trends of the pair fraction evolution are consistent with the predictions from the observed evolution of galaxy number densities and the two - point correlation function for both the blue cloud and red sequence .    \\3 . for the chosen luminosity range",
    ", we find that at low redshift ( @xmath164 ) the pair fraction within the red sequence is greater than that of the blue cloud , indicating a higher merger probability within the red sequence compared to that within the blue cloud .",
    "\\4 . with further assumptions on the merger timescale and the fraction of pairs that will merge ,",
    "the galaxy major merger rates for @xmath6 are estimated to be @xmath7 @xmath8mpc@xmath9gyr@xmath10 ( with the uncertainty about a factor of 2 ) , dominated by wet mergers ( gas - rich mergers ) until very recently .",
    "there were more wet merger events than dry or mixed mergers because of the higher number density of blue galaxies for the chosen luminosity cut .",
    "however , the fraction of mergers which are dry or mixed increases over time , from 8% and 24% at @xmath16 to 25% and 44% at @xmath118 respectively .",
    "the growth of dry merger rates with decreasing redshift is mainly due to the rise in the co - moving number density of red galaxies with time .",
    "our results on the fraction of mergers of different types are in good agreement with theoretical predictions by @xcite based on semi - analytical models .",
    "\\5 . about 22% to 54% of present - day",
    "@xmath14 galaxies have experienced major mergers since @xmath15 , depending on the definition of major mergers . moreover , 24% of the red galaxies at the present epoch have had dry mergers with luminosity ratio less than 4:1 since @xmath16 .",
    "\\6 . given the @xmath24-band luminosity cut ,",
    "the blue and red galaxies in our sample possess different stellar masses : the typical stellar mass of red galaxies in our sample is about 5 times greater than that of the blue galaxies . by assuming that a significant fraction of wet / mixed mergers will end up as red galaxies as well as dry mergers , our results suggest that the three types of mergers lead to red galaxies in different stellar mass regimes : the wet mergers and/or mixed mergers may be partially responsible for producing red galaxies with intermediate masses while dry mergers in our sample produce a significant portion of massive red galaxies at low redshift .",
    "+ we have demonstrated that the redshift evolution of pair fractions and merger rates depend on galaxy types , owing to the color dependence of the evolution in the galaxy number density and clustering . in terms of the absolute number of events , wet mergers dominate merger events at @xmath162 .",
    "however , dry and mixed mergers become more important over time , in particular at very low redshifts ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "our findings support the late growth of massive red galaxies through dry mergers as concluded by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , our results also suggest that wet and mixed mergers are responsible for producing red - sequence galaxies in lower stellar mass regimes .",
    "more observational and theoretical studies on the effects of the three types of mergers on the star formation in the merger remnants will help us to constrain better the role of galaxy mergers in forming red - sequence galaxies .",
    "one uncertainty that can affect the relative importance of the three types of mergers is that we have adopted a constant merger timescale for all types of mergers in our analysis .",
    "this approach is based on the assumption that the @xmath24-band light is a good tracer of dynamical mass @xcite and hence the merger timescale should be comparable in different types of pairs selected by the same @xmath47 cut .",

    "<S> we study the redshift evolution of galaxy pair fractions and merger rates for different types of galaxies using kinematic pairs selected from the deep2 redshift survey , combined with other surveys at lower redshifts . by parameterizing the evolution of the pair fraction as @xmath0 , we find that the companion rate increases mildly with redshift with @xmath1 for all galaxies with @xmath2 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> blue galaxies show slightly faster evolution in the blue companion rate with @xmath4 , while red galaxies have had fewer red companions in the past as evidenced by the negative slope @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the different trends of pair fraction evolution are consistent with the predictions from the observed evolution of galaxy number densities and the two - point correlation function for both the blue cloud and red sequence . for the chosen luminosity range , we find that at low redshift the pair fraction within the red sequence exceeds that of the blue cloud , indicating a higher merger probability among red galaxies compared to that among the blue galaxies . with further assumptions on the merger timescale and the fraction of pairs that will merge , </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy major merger rates for @xmath6 are estimated to be @xmath7 @xmath8mpc@xmath9gyr@xmath10 with a factor of 2 uncertainty . at @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> 68% of mergers are wet , 8% of mergers are dry , and 24% of mergers are mixed , compared to 31% wet mergers , 25% dry mergers , and 44% mixed mergers at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> wet mergers dominate merging events at @xmath13 , but the relative importance of dry and mixed mergers increases over time . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of dry merger rates with decreasing redshift is mainly due to the increase in the co - moving number density of red galaxies over time . about 22% to 54% of present - day </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 galaxies have experienced major mergers since @xmath15 , depending on the definition of major mergers . moreover , 24% of the red galaxies at the present epoch have had dry mergers with luminosity ratios between 1:4 and 4:1 since @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> our results also suggest that all three types of mergers play an important role in the growth of the red sequence , assuming that a significant fraction of wet / mixed mergers will also end up as red galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the three types of mergers lead to red galaxies in different stellar mass regimes : the wet mergers and/or mixed mergers may be partially responsible for producing red galaxies with intermediate masses while a significant portion of massive red galaxies are assembled through dry mergers at later times . </S>"
