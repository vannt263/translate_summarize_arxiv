    "cygnus x-1 has become perhaps the most extensively studied x - ray binary , particularly due to its providing the first observational evidence for black holes .",
    "webster & murdin ( 1972 ) and bolton ( 1972 ) independently associated the x - ray source with hde 226868 , found an orbital period of 5.6 days and calculated the first mass function to indicate a compact object more massive than 3 @xmath3 , the generally accepted maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    "the values of the masses of the two components have been refined a number of times , most recently by herrero et al .",
    "( 1995 ) giving 17.8 @xmath3 for the supergiant companion star and 10.1 @xmath3 for the black hole .",
    "a number of periods have been reported in the various lightcurves of cygnus x-1 .",
    "these include 294 days in the x - rays ( priedhorsky , terrell & holt 1983 ) and optical photometry ( kemp et al . 1987 ) , 150 days in the radio ( pooley , fender & brocksopp 1998 ) 78/39 days in uv polarimetry ( kemp , herman , rudy & barbour 1977 ) , optical photometry ( kemp , herman & barbour 1978 ) and 4.5 years in optical photometry ( wilson & fox 1981 ) .    however , the orbital period is the only one that is confirmed in all wavebands and by most authors .",
    "it has been detected in the x - ray data of _ ariel v_/asm ( holt , kaluzienski , boldt & serlemitsos 1976 ) , _",
    "rxte_/asm + ( zhang , robinson & cui 1996 ) and _ cgro_/batse ( paciesas et al . 1997 ) and also in the radio ( pooley , fender & brocksopp 1998 ) , optical photometry ( volushina , lyuty & tarasov 1997 ) , optical spectroscopy ( e.g. gies & bolton 1982 ) and infrared ( leahy & ananth 1992 ; nadzhip et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic ephemeris has been revised many times using a variety of lines .",
    "the results of gies & bolton ( 1982 ) have been used ( @xmath4 days ) as the definitive values for over a decade and there has been little disagreement ; while a variable orbital period was tentatively suggested ( ninkov , walker & yang 1987 ) this has never been confirmed and appears unlikely .",
    "it is only recently that a new ephemeris has been calculated ( @xmath5 days ) and this is within the errors of the gies & bolton ( 1982 ) result ( lasala et al .",
    "a more accurate result is given as @xmath6 days ( sowers et al .",
    "1998 ) which also takes hipparcos photometrical data into account .",
    "the spectrum is that of a typical o9 supergiant with moderate h@xmath7 emission , presumably coming from the supergiant ( e.g. brucato & zappala 1974 ) , and also heii@xmath84686 emission .",
    "both of these emission lines are superimposed on absorption components and , by distinguishing the two components , it has been shown by a number of authors ( e.g. aab 1983a ) that the heii emission component is @xmath9 out of phase with the heii absorption component and the supergiant . as a result of this",
    "it is thought that the heii emission originates in the accretion stream .",
    "neither of these absorption components are suitable for measuring radial velocity due to the inaccuracies involved in the removal of the superimposed emission . instead , as previously , we turn to the hei absorption lines which are uncontaminated by emission .",
    "our spectra were obtained in june / july 1997 using the coud spectrograph of the crimean astrophysical observatory s 2.6 metre telescope .",
    "the detector was a cds9000 ( 1024@xmath10256 pixels ) ccd array .",
    "all observations were made in the second order of a diffraction grating with reciprocal dispersion of 3 / mm and resolution of 25000 .",
    "the typical exposure time for each spectrum totalled 1.5 hours resulting in a s / n of @xmath11100",
    ".    with a spectral width of 60 , our 20 spectra centred on heii@xmath12 also included the hei@xmath13 line .",
    "this is the line we have used for our radial velocity studies , although other sources have used alternative helium lines .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard flat ",
    "field normalisation and sky subtraction techniques .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved using thar comparison spectra and to an accuracy of less than 0.5 km / s .",
    "the radial velocities were calculated by fitting a gaussian to the core of each line and values of @xmath14 can be found in table 1 .    to obtain the orbital solution we initially considered all of the radial velocity measurements .",
    "it was necessary to subtract centre of mass velocities ( @xmath15-velocities ) for each source to account for differences between the data sets due to the various telescopes , instruments , choice of lines and methods of radial velocity determination used .",
    "the radial velocities of a total of 48 different lines were used in the calculation of our ephemeris  the majority of these can be found in table 2 of gies & bolton ( 1982 ) ; we also use additional hei lines ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , oxygen lines ( oii@xmath21 , oii@xmath22 , oiii@xmath23 ) , mgii@xmath24 and nii,@xmath25 . as with previous authors ,",
    "all lines were treated equally , although we note that inhomogeneities in the atmosphere of the supergiant ( due to the variety of velocities in the stellar wind ) cause greater shifting in the red hei lines than the blue  unfortunately it is not possible to correct for this without knowing exactly which authors used which lines for each radial velocity measurement .    with so many radial velocities from fourteen different sources we were then able to omit those spectra for which o - c @xmath26 km / s and still have a total of 421 points from which to construct a radial velocity curve .",
    "we have also omitted the results of seyfert & popper 1941 for reasons discussed in lasala et al .",
    "the resultant radial velocity curve is shown in figure 1 ; residuals are also plotted and show a definite lack of structure . weighting all points by the inverse of their r.m.s .",
    "error and assuming an orbit of zero eccentricity the orbital parameters were obtained using the fotel3 software .",
    "they can be found in table 3 , along with the elements calculated using the photometric data .",
    "we calculate the orbital period to be @xmath27 and define t@xmath28 as the time of superior conjunction of the black hole .",
    "our new , high quality spectra have enabled us to extend the baseline for the ephemeris by over 400 days . as well as improving the accuracy of the radial velocity curve",
    "it also emphasizes the stability of the orbit of cygnus x-1 over long time intervals .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge receipt of financial support from the royal society for collaborative work with the former soviet union . c. brocksopp acknowledges a pparc studentship ; v.lyuty and a.tarasov are grateful to rfbr ( grant 98 - 02 - 17067 ) for support in part .",
    "the majority of this work was accomplished on the sussex starlink node .",
