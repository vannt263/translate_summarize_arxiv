    "in the gribov - zwanziger scenario @xcite , confinement of quarks ( in landau and in coulomb gauge ) is related to a ghost propagator @xmath0 enhanced in the infrared ( ir ) limit when compared to the tree - level propagator @xmath3 .",
    "an enhanced ghost propagator is also required by the kugo - ojima criterion @xcite in order to explain confinement of color charge ( in landau gauge ) .    in order to investigate the origin of this ir enhancement we consider , following ref.@xcite , a generic gauge condition @xmath4=0 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the gauge field .",
    "the condition is imposed on the lattice by minimizing a functional @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 is the ( gauge ) link variable . from the second variation of @xmath6",
    "$ ] one can define the faddeev - popov ( fp ) matrix @xmath8 .",
    "( here we use @xmath9 and @xmath10 to indicate color indices , whereas @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent points of the lattice . ) in the su(@xmath13 ) case , @xmath14 is an @xmath15 matrix , where @xmath16 is the lattice volume , given by the number of points @xmath17 along each side of the lattice and by the space - time dimension @xmath18 .",
    "this matrix is real and symmetric with respect to the exchange @xmath19 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough discussion of the properties of the fp matrix in landau gauge ) . at any ( local ) minimum of @xmath6 $ ] , all the eigenvalues of @xmath14 are positive ( modulo trivial null eigenvalues ) .",
    "the set of all minima of @xmath6 $ ] is the so - called gribov region @xmath20 . on the boundary of @xmath20",
    " known as the first gribov horizon @xmath21  the smallest nontrivial eigenvalue @xmath22 of the fp matrix is null . since the configuration space has very large dimensionality we expect that , in the limit of large lattice volumes @xmath23 , entropy favors configurations near @xmath21 @xcite , i.e.  @xmath22 should go to zero in this limit .",
    "this is indeed the case in 2d @xcite , 3d @xcite and 4d landau gauge @xcite , in 4d coulomb gauge @xcite and in 4d maximally abelian gauge ( mag ) @xcite .",
    "the ghost propagator is written in terms of the inverse of the fp matrix as @xmath24 where the lattice momentum @xmath25 has components @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "also , here and in the formulae below , a path - integral average is understood . since @xmath8 develops a null eigenvalue at the gribov horizon @xmath28 , one might expect that the corresponding ghost propagator diverges at small momenta in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "this could in turn introduce a long - range effect in the theory , related to the color - confinement mechanism @xcite .",
    "indeed , in several numerical studies ( using relatively small lattice volumes ) , the ghost propagator @xmath0 seems to be ir - enhanced in 3d @xcite and 4d landau gauge @xcite and in 4d coulomb gauge @xcite . on the other hand , in mag @xcite",
    "one finds an ir - finite @xmath0 . at the same time",
    ", recent results in landau gauge using very large lattice volumes @xcite suggest an essentially tree - level - like ir ghost propagator @xmath0 in 3d and in 4d .",
    "( a similar result has been obtained in refs .  @xcite using different analytic approaches . )",
    "finally , in the 2d case , one finds @xcite @xmath29 after extrapolating data for the ir exponent @xmath30 to infinite volume .",
    "therefore , we have cases for which @xmath0 is not ir - enhanced in the infinite - volume limit and thus the argument reported above can not be valid in general @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to understand under what conditions one should expect an ir - enhanced ghost propagator @xmath0 .",
    "this is done by investigating constraints on the behavior of @xmath0 and thus obtaining better control over its infinite - volume extrapolation .",
    "clearly , since the only diverging quantity ( besides the lattice volume ) is @xmath31 , the ir enhancement of @xmath0 may be closely related to this eigenvalue and to the projection of its corresponding eigenvector @xmath32 on the plane waves @xmath33 for small momenta @xmath25 .",
    "in this section we obtain upper and lower bounds for the momentum - space ghost propagator @xmath0 in terms of the smallest nonzero eigenvalue @xmath22 [ and of the corresponding eigenvector @xmath32 ] of the fp matrix @xmath8 . to this end , let us first introduce our notation . as usual , we define the generic eigenvalue @xmath35 of @xmath8 and the corresponding eigenvector @xmath36 by using the relation @xmath37 , where the index @xmath38 takes values @xmath39 and the sum over repeated indices is understood .",
    "as stressed in the introduction , this matrix is positive ( or semi - positive ) definite , whenever we use a minimizing condition in order to fix a gauge ( minimal gauge ) .",
    "also , since it is obtained from a second - order expansion , this matrix can always be written in a symmetric form .",
    "then , the eigenvectors @xmath36 can be assumed orthogonal to each other and normalized as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 indicates complex conjugation . using this notation we can write @xmath42 note that we are working in the space orthogonal to the kernel of the fp matrix",
    ". then we can write the inverse of this matrix as @xcite @xmath43 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fourier transform of the eigenvector @xmath36 .",
    "since all the nonzero eigenvalues are positive and @xmath46 , we can write the inequalities @xmath47 & & g(p ) \\ , \\leq \\ , \\frac{1}{n_c^2 - 1 } \\ ,",
    "\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{min } } \\ ,                \\sum_{i , \\lambda_i \\neq 0 } \\ , \\sum_a \\ ,",
    "| { \\widetilde \\psi_i(a , p ) } \\ , |^2 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : ineq2ini}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( note that we assume nondegenerate eigenvalues",
    ". however , the second inequality applies also when @xmath22 is degenerate and the first one can be easily modified to take a degeneracy into account . ) by summing and subtracting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq2ini ] ) the contributions from the eigenvectors corresponding to a null eigenvalue and using the completeness relation @xmath48 , we find @xmath49 \\ ; . \\label{eq : ineq2}\\ ] ] let us stress that the above results are simply a consequence of the positivity of the fp matrix , i.e.  they apply to gauge - fixed configurations that belong to the interior of the first gribov region .",
    ".[tab1 ] the ghost propagator @xmath50 for the smallest nonzero momentum @xmath51 and the inverse of the smallest nonzero eigenvalue @xmath22 of the fp matrix for various lattice volumes and @xmath52 values in the 3d case . data ( in physical units ) are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "our data suggest that the landau - gauge ghost propagator does not diverge faster than @xmath3 at small momenta in 3d and in 4d , while in 2d @xmath0 does not diverge faster than @xmath1 with @xmath30 between 0.1 and 0.2 , in agreement with ref .",
    "these results have been obtained by considering the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq2 ] ) and by fitting the data for @xmath50 and @xmath22 as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , we note that the use of the upper bound to constrain @xmath0 is quite convenient , since @xmath22 does not depend on @xmath54 .",
    "it might thus be of interest to optimize the evaluation of @xmath22 and of @xmath55 .",
    "the results obtained here in the 3d and 4d cases , together with those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the gluon propagator , seem to contradict the gribov - zwanziger confinement scenario for landau gauge . on the other hand",
    ", one should establish if the behavior of gluon and ghost propagators at very small momenta is really so essential for the explanation of confinement .",
    "after all , when dynamical quarks are considered , string breaking should manifest itself at a scale of about a fermi , i.e.  for a energy scale of about 200 mev .",
    "thus , for the physics of hadrons the behavior of the propagators at intermediate momenta is probably more important",
    ". let us recall that for a space - time separation of about 1 fermi the transverse gluon propagator violates reflection positivity @xcite , i.e.  becomes negative in real - space coordinates , and the exponent @xmath30 for the ghost propagator is about 0.2 - 0.3 considering @xmath56 gev @xcite .",
    "thus , in the range 200 - 500 mev , nonperturbative effects are clearly present in the behavior of the gluon and of the ghost propagator . for this range of momenta the use of our lower bound for the ghost propagator could probably also be valuable .",
    "of course , the open problem is if these effects suffice to explain color confinement .",
    "discussions with several participants of the workshop on _ quarks and hadrons in strong qcd _ ( st .  goar ) are acknowledged .",
    "we also thank r.  sommer for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
