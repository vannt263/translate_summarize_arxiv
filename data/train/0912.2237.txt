    "the human heart does not beat at a constant rate , even for a subject in repose .",
    "rather , there is strong variability of the heart rate .",
    "the complexity of this heart rate variability ( hrv ) presents a major challenge that has attracted continuing attention .",
    "many of the explanations proposed are by analogy with paradigms used in physics to describe complexity , including : deterministic chaos @xcite ; the statistical theory of turbulence @xcite ; fractal brownian motion @xcite ; and critical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "they have led to new approaches and time - series analysis techniques including a variety of entropies @xcite , dimensional analysis @xcite , the correlation of local energy fluctuations on different scales @xcite , the analysis of long range correlation @xcite , spectral scaling @xcite , the multiscale time asymmetry index @xcite , multifractal cascades @xcite .",
    "all these measures allow one to describe hrv as a non - stationary , irregular , complex fluctuating process .",
    "depending on the technique in use there has been a very wide range of conclusions about the regulatory mechanism of heart rate , ranging from a stochastic feedback configuration @xcite to the physical system being in a critical state @xcite .",
    "hrv can also be considered in terms of the interactions between coupled oscillators of widely differing frequencies @xcite .",
    "although we now have this huge variety of tools and approaches for the analysis of hrv , only the last - mentioned has enabled us to understand the origins of some of the time - scales embedded in hrv . each time - scale ( frequency ) in the coupled oscillator model @xcite is represented by a separate self - oscillator that interacts with the others , and each of the oscillators represents a particular physiological function .",
    "the frequency variations in hrv can therefore be attributed to the effects of respiration ( @xmath00.25hz ) , and myogenic ( @xmath00.1hz ) , neurogenic ( @xmath00.03hz ) and endothelial ( @xmath00.01hz ) activity .",
    "hrv also contains a fast ( short time - scale ) noisy component which forms a noise background in the hrv spectrum and can be modelled as a white noise source @xcite .",
    "its properties are currently an open question , and one that is important for both understanding and modelling hrv .",
    "a practical difficulty in experimental investigations is the presence of a strong perturbation , respiration , that occurs continuously and exerts a particularly strong influence in modulating the heart rate .",
    "this modulation involves several mechanisms : via mechanical movements of the chest , chemo - reflex , and couplings to neuronal control centres @xcite .",
    "spontaneous respiration gives rise to a complex non - periodic signal , and this complexity is inevitably reflected in hrv @xcite .",
    "so , in order to understand the properties of the fast noise , one would ideally remove the respiratory perturbation and consider the residual hrv which would then reflect fluctuations of the intrinsic dynamics of the heart control system .",

    ", width=453 ]    consideration of the intrinsic activity of the heart control system on short - time scales is important for general understanding of the function of the cardio - vascular system , leads potentially to diagnostics of causes of arrhythmia involving problems with neuronal control @xcite , and can be a benchmark for modeling hrv . in this paper we present the results of an experimental study of the intrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory system and discuss these results in the context of modelling the fast noise component .",
    "a number of open problems are identified .",
    "we analyse the dynamics of the control system in the absence of explicit perturbations by temporarily _ removing _ the continuing perturbations caused by respiration [ figure  [ fig1](b ) ] . to do so , we perform experiments involving modest breath - holding ( apna ) intervals . note that during long breath - holding the normal state of the cardiovascular system is significantly modified @xcite .",
    "the idea of the experiments came from the observation that spontaneous apna occurs during repose .",
    "apna intervals of up to 30 sec were used , enabling us to avoid either anoxia or hyper - ventilation @xcite .",
    "respiration - free intervals were produced by _ intermittent respiration _",
    ", involving an alternation between several normal ( non - deep ) breaths and then a breath - hold following the last expiration , as indicated by the dashed line in figure  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the respiratory amplitude was kept close to normal to avoid hyper - ventilation , and there were relatively long intervals of apna when the heart dynamics was not perturbed by respiration .",
    "it is precisely these intervals that are our main object of analysis .",
    "the durations of both respiration and apna intervals were fixed at 30 sec .",
    "measurements were carried out for 5 relaxed supine subjects , and they were approved by research ethics committee of lancaster university .",
    "note that the measurements presented have been selected from a larger number of measurements to form a set recorded under almost identical conditions of time and duration , with the subjects avoiding either coffee or a meal for at least 2 hours beforehand .",
    "they were 4 males and 1 female , aged in the range 2936 years , non - smokers , without any history of heart disease .",
    "we stress that the aim of the current investigation was exploratory : to study typical behaviour of the internal regulatory system ; we have not performed a large - scale trial of the kind widely used in medicine when a large number of subjects is necessary because of the need for subsequent statistical analysis of the data .",
    "the electrocardiogram ( ecg ) and respiration signals were recorded @xcite over 45 - 60 minutes .",
    "the ecg signals were transformed to hrv by using the marked events method for extraction of the @xmath1-intervals which are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows @xmath1-intervals found for the different types of respiration .",
    "it is evident that respiration changes the heart rhythm very significantly .",
    "immediately after exhalation ( b ) , there is an apna interval where the heart rhythm fluctuates around some level .",
    "these fluctuations correspond to the intrinsic dynamics of the heart control system .",
    "it is clear from ( a ) that heart rate is _ continuously _ perturbed during normal respiration , whereas in ( b ) one can distinguish an interval of intrinsic dynamics corresponding to apna .",
    "thus , the @xmath3th interval of apna is characterized by the time series @xmath4 ; here @xmath5 labels the @xmath6th @xmath1-interval .",
    "finally , we form a set @xmath7 for analyses by considering the set as realizations of a random walk and analyzing their dynamical properties as such .    to reveal dynamics additional to @xmath1-intervals , the differential increments @xmath8 were analyzed .",
    "the differences between @xmath1-intervals and their increments are illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "each apna time - series @xmath7 exhibits a trend that is describable by the slope @xmath9 of a linear function @xmath10 , where @xmath6 is a heart beat number and @xmath3 marks @xmath3th apna interval .",
    "the trend can be characterized by the distribution of slopes @xmath11 shown in figure  [ fig4 ] ( a ) . for all measurements the distributions are broad and",
    "their mean values differ from zero .",
    "thus the non - stationary nature of hrv on short time - scales is clearly apparent .",

    "we adapted the dfa method @xcite for short time - series and used non - overlapped windows ( see appendix for details ) . because the time - series were short , time windows of length 415 @xmath1-intervals were used to calculate @xmath17 . for all measured subjects ,",
    "this procedure yielded values of @xmath17 lying within the range @xmath19 , with a mean value of @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath1-intervals in the sets @xmath18 are replaced by realizations of brown noise ( the integral of white noise ) keeping same lengths of apna intervals , then the calculation gives @xmath21 .",
    "additionally , a surrogate analysis was performed for each subject by random shuffling of the time indices @xmath6 of @xmath22-intervals , to confirm the importance of time - ordering of the @xmath1-intervals . for each realization ( set @xmath18 ) , 100 surrogate sets were generated , 100 values of @xmath17 were obtained , and the mean value @xmath23 was calculated .",
    "values of @xmath23 for the surrogate sets lie in the same limits as those for the original sets , but with a small bias between @xmath17 , calculated using original sets , and @xmath23 ( see the appendix for values of @xmath17 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "it means that one can see a correlation between @xmath1-intervals , but that it is weak . summarizing the dfa results",

    "an approximation of @xmath34 by the function @xmath35 demonstrates that oscillations occur with frequency near @xmath36 hz , presumably corresponding to myogenic processes @xcite or ( perhaps equivalently ) to the mayer wave associated with blood pressure feedback @xcite .",
    "further investigations via the parametrical spectral analysis for each apna interval show that these oscillations are of an on - off nature , i.e.  observed for parts of the apna intervals , and not in all of the measurements as can be seen in figure  [ fig5 ] ( b ) .",

    "we conclude that the short - time dynamics of @xmath1-intervals can be described as a stochastic process with stationary increments .",
    "this type of stochastic processes was discussed by a. n. kolmogorov @xcite and applied to the description of a number of different problems ( see e.g. @xcite for further details ) .",
    "so , hrv during apna interval cab be presented in the following form @xmath50 where @xmath37 is a stationary discrete time stochastic process .",
    "note that the dfa calculation excludes a linear trend , which is taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ spsi ] ) as non - zero mean value of the increments , @xmath51 ; in general case , @xmath52 is a random function of @xmath3th apna interval .",
    "if one represents @xmath1-intervals as a sum of the linear trend and a random component : @xmath53 then @xmath54 corresponds to the non - stationary process ( [ spsi ] ) with zero mean value of increments . in other words , the superimposed random component of hrv during apna intervals",
    "is described by a non - stationary random process .",
    "increments @xmath37 are characterized by a random @xmath40-stable process of short memory , with a weak intermittent oscillatory component of frequency @xmath00.1  hz . in the zeroth approximation",
    "the increments can _ safely _ be represented by an uncorrelated gaussian random process but , in the next approximation , a weak correlation must be included , allowing for an intermittent oscillatory component , and for weak non - gaussianity of the distribution of increments @xmath55 .",
    "these additions reveal , on the one hand , that the previously reported observation of a non - gaussian distribution of increments @xcite is a property of the intrinsic heart rate regulatory system , but on the other hand , that the scaling ranges of the stability index @xmath40 differ significantly in the presence or absence of external perturbations ( including respiration ) acting on the regulatory system",
    ". consequently an explanation of the scalings reported in @xcite should include analyses of the effect of external perturbations and respiration , and not an analysis of heart rate alone .",
    "the results presented indicate that there is no firm set point for the heart control system , and that the heart rhythm exhibits diffusive behaviour .",
    "the slowest dynamics can be described by a linear trend during apna intervals and its presence can be treated as a slow regulatory / adaptation component of the control system .",
    "the presence of the slow time - scales is an established property of hrv @xcite and their presence , even in the absence of the respiratory perturbation , can be interpreted as an expected property .    on short time - scales of order several seconds",
    ", hrv shows a diffusive dynamics too .",
    "it can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "one possibility is that the control system does not firmly trace the base ( slow ) rhythm , because in case of tracing , short time - fluctuations should `` jump '' around the base rhythm and , consequently , be stationary .",
    "such a picture corresponds to zero action of the control system if the heart rate is in a `` safe '' ( for the whole cardiovascular system ) interval , e.g. @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "another possible explanation could be that the control system is tracing the base rhythm but the short - time fluctuations have a non - stationary character .",
    "it is natural to expect that there could be other possible explanations , and additional investigations are needed to reach an understanding of the diffusive dynamics on short - time scales .    in section 2",
    "it is suggested that we should consider the non - stationarity and diffusive dynamics of @xmath1-intervals within the framework of a stochastic process with independent increments .",
    "it allows one to consider @xmath1-intervals as realizations of the so - called auto - regressive process that is widely used in time - series analysis @xcite .",
    "it means that the direct spectral estimation of @xmath1-intervals , currently used as one of the basic techniques @xcite , is not applicable here and that one must use the theory of stochastic processes with stationary increments for their spectral decomposition @xcite .",
    "if in the presence of respiration , the short - time stochastic component of hrv preserves non - stationarity then spectral estimation based on @xmath1-intervals is not correct , and increments must be used instead .",
    "note , that the properties of short - time fluctuations in the presence of respiration are far from being completely understood .",
    "the theories of both stochastic processes with stationary increments and of auto - regressive analysis place some limitations on the analysed time - series .",
    "the first approach requires the existence of finite second - order momenta , whereas the second approach assumes uncorrelated statistics of increments .",
    "formally , however , non - gaussianity of the increments distribution means that the second - order momenta do not exist @xcite , but non - gaussianity can still be incorporated into the auto - regressive description @xcite . and _ vice versa _ , the presence of correlations in the increments dynamics requires a modification of the standard auto - regressive approach , and it is one that can be incorporated naturally into the general theory . in the current investigation",
    "we ignore these issues .",
    "we calculate the auto - correlation function and use model ( [ spsi ] ) , because the finite length of the time - series guarantees the existence of the second - order momenta , and the simplicity of ( [ spsi ] ) means that the inclusion of the correlations is a trivial extension .",
    "our consideration has the formal character of time - series analysis because we do not incorporate any preliminary information about the possible dynamics of @xmath1-intervals .",
    "the analysis is based on the use of a set of relatively short time - series , a fact that defines our choice of simple statistical measures .",
    "one can not exclude the possibility that the use of other approaches to such data might provide additional insight into hrv dynamics .",
    "for example , the fractional brownian motion approach @xcite and the theory of discrete non - stationary non - markov random process @xcite represent different paradigms , which are based on assumptions about the origin of the data .",
    "note , that despite a long history of developing the approaches and their applications , the approaches of fractional brownian motion and of stable random process are not standardized tools , whereas the approach of non - markov random process is not so popular .",
    "there is no definite recipe for choosing a set of measures which can uniquely specify ( or provide a good description of ) the properties of a renewal ( discrete time ) stochastic process .",
    "another way of attempting to understand the results is to try to reproduce the observed data properties from an appropriate model . in the context of our experiments ,",
    "the modelling should consist of a simulation of the electrical activity of sinoatrial node ( san ) where the heart beats are initiated . for modelling ,",
    "one option is to use a bottom - up approach , which is currently a very popular technique within the framework of the complexity paradigm .",
    "in fact , available san cellular models allow one to incorporate many details of physiological processes like the openings and closures of specific ion channels @xcite .",
    "however , despite the complexity of the models ( 40100 variables ) many important features are still missed .",
    "for example , the fundamentally stochastic dynamics of ion channels is represented by equations that are deterministic .",
    "heterogeneity of the san cellular locations and intercell communications are among other important open issues @xcite .",
    "an alternative option is the top - down approach using integrative phenomenological models .",
    "in contrast to detailed cell models , a toy model of the heart as a whole unit can be developed .",
    "it is known that an isolated heart , and a heart in the case of a brain - dead patient @xcite demonstrate nearly periodic behaviour .",
    "so , it is reasonable to assume that the observed hrv is induced by the neuronal heart control system , which is a part of the central nervous system .",
    "the control system includes a primary site for regulation located in the medulla @xcite , consisting of a set of neural networks with connections to the hypothalamus and the cortex .",
    "the control is realized via two branches of the nervous system : the parasympathetic ( vagal ) and the sympathetic branches .",
    "although many details of the control system are still missing @xcite , it is currently accepted that the vagal branch operates on faster time scales than the sympathetic one , and that each branch has a specific co - operative action on the heart rate and the dynamics of san cells .",
    "let us consider an integrate - and - fire ( if ) model as a model of a san cell in the leading pacemaker .",
    "these cells are responsible for initiating the activity of san cells and , consequently , that of the whole heart @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the if model describes the membrane potential @xmath57 of the cell by the following equations @xmath58 here @xmath59 defines a slope of integration , @xmath60 is the threshold potential , @xmath61 is the resting ( hyperpolarization ) potential ; the time @xmath62 corresponds to the cell firing , and it is the difference between two successive firings that determines the instantaneous heart period or @xmath1-interval , @xmath63 .",
    "it is known @xcite that increasing sympathetic activity with a combination of decreasing vagal activity leads to an increase in the heart period , and _",
    "vice versa_. direct stimulation of the sympathetic branch leads to an increase of the integration slope @xmath59 and a lowering of the threshold potential @xmath60 , whereas vagal activation has the opposite effects , and additionally , lowers the resting potential @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the neuronal activities can be taken into account as modulations of the parameters of the if model ( [ ifmodel ] ) . for reproducing hrv during apna , therefore ,",
    "it is enough to present any of the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath60 or @xmath61 as a stochastic variable of the form ( [ spsi ] ) , for example , @xmath65 , where @xmath54 are random numbers having the stable distribution .",
    "however , the use of more realistic ( than if ) models with oscillatory dynamics , for example fitzhugh - nagumo @xcite or morris - lecar @xcite models , makes the reproduction of the experimental results a more difficult but interesting task .",
    "currently it is unclear whether it is possible to obtain a stable distribution of increments by consideration of the gaussian type of fluctuations alone , or whether one should use fluctuations characterizing by a stable distribution .",
    "this point demands further investigation .",
    "in summary , our experimental modification of the respiration process reveals that the intrinsic dynamics of the heart rate regulatory system exhibits stochastic features and can be viewed as the integrated action of many weakly interacting components . even on a short time scale",
    "( less then half a minute ) the heart rate is non - stationary and exhibits diffusive dynamics with superimposed intermittent @xmath00.1  hz oscillations .",
    "the intrinsic dynamics can be described as a stochastic process with independent increments and can be understood within the framework of many - body dynamics as used in statistical physics .",
    "the large number of independent regulatory perturbations produce a noisy regulatory background , so that the dynamics of the regulatory rhythm is close to classical brownian motion .",
    "however there are indications of non - gaussianity of increments and weak but important correlations on short time - scales .",
    "the reproduction of these features , especially the non - gaussianity property , is an open problem even in simple toy models .",
    "these results are important both for understanding the general principles of regulation in biological systems , and for modeling cardiovascular dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the results presented may possibly lead to a new clinical classification of states of the cardiovascular system by analysing the intrinsic dynamics of the heart control system as suggested in @xcite .",

    "some details of the measurements and calculations are summarized in this section .",
    "the ecg was measured by standard limb ( einthoven ) leads and the respiration signal was measured by a thoracic strain gauge transducer .",
    "the signals were digitized by a 16-bit analog - to - digital converter with a sampling rate of 2 khz .",
    "the ecg and respiration signals were recorded over 45 - 60 minutes and time locations of @xmath66-peaks in the ecg signals were defined and time intervals between two subsequent @xmath66-peaks ( the so called @xmath1-intervals ) are used to form hrv signal .",
