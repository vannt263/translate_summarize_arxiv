    "@xmath1140 is always satisfied and at each double resonant point some other @xmath1141 exists such that @xmath21 is linearly independent of @xmath16 and @xmath1142 holds .",
    "recall the process of kam iteration , the main part of the resonant term is obtained by averaging the perturbation over a circle determined by these two resonant relations .",
    "it takes the form @xmath1143 where @xmath1144 since @xmath6 is @xmath1145-function , the coefficient @xmath1146 is bounded by @xmath1147 which induces the estimation @xmath1148 where @xmath1149 depends on @xmath16 . just like the procedure we did in the second section ,",
    "after the rescaling and linear coordinate transformation we get the main part of the system @xmath1150 assume @xmath1151 has a non - degenerate minimal point at @xmath873 , i.e. @xmath1152 , the system @xmath1153 possesses a nhic @xmath1154 where @xmath1155 solves the equation @xmath1156 .",
    "applying the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold theorem , one obtains from the estimate ( [ criterioneq1 ] ) that some positive number @xmath1157 exists such that @xmath227 also admits a normally hyperbolic and invariant cylinder @xmath1158 close to @xmath1159 provided @xmath1160 it is a criterion to see whether the double resonance is thought as weak resonance and can be treated in the way for _ a priori _ unstable system .",
    "however , we obtain the potential @xmath122 by fixing @xmath1161 .",
    "so , the non - degeneracy of the minimal point depends on the position of double resonant point on the resonant path @xmath114 , i.e. the number @xmath207 depends on the @xmath1162 . because the set of double resonant points is dense along the resonant path , it appears necessary to ask whether it holds simultaneously for all @xmath1163 that the minimal point of @xmath1164 is non - degenerate when it is treated as a function of @xmath1165 .",
    "fortunately , we have the following result @xcite    [ singlecylinder ] assume @xmath1166 is a closed manifold with finite dimensions , @xmath1167 with @xmath1168 for each @xmath1169 $ ] and @xmath1170 is lipschitz in the parameter @xmath1171",
    ". then , there exists an open - dense set @xmath1172 so that for each @xmath94 , it holds simultaneously for all @xmath1169 $ ] that the minimal of @xmath1173 is non - degenerate .",
    "in fact , given @xmath94 there are finitely many @xmath1174 $ ] such that @xmath1173 has only one global minimal @xmath263maximal@xmath264 point for @xmath1175 and has two global minimal @xmath263maximal@xmath264 point if @xmath1176 .",
    "so , once one has a generic single resonant term @xmath1177 , the non - degeneracy @xmath207 is lower bounded from zero for all double resonant points .",
    "there are finitely many @xmath1141 which do not satisfy the condition ( [ criterioneq2 ] ) , thus need to be treated as strong double resonance . obviously , the number of such points is independent of @xmath52 .",
    "it follows from theorem [ singlecylinder ] that there are finitely many point @xmath1178 where the single resonant term @xmath1177 has two global minimal points when it is treated as the function @xmath1179 .",
    "it is clearly generic that the condition ( * h3 * ) holds for @xmath1177 .",
    "it implies that as one move @xmath1180 along @xmath114 , the mather set varies along one cylinder and jump to another cylinder when it crosses the point @xmath1181 which is called bifurcation point .",
    "it is also generic that none of these bifurcation points is strong double resonant point .",
    "* remark*. given a resonant path determined by a class @xmath142 , we obtain a channel @xmath1182 . by the result we get in this paper",
    ", this channel has certain width except the place very close to the disk which corresponds to strong double resonance @xmath1183 .",
    "for each @xmath1184 with @xmath1185 , the aubry set is located in certain nhic @xcite . by using the method of @xcite",
    ", this aubry set can be connected to other aubry set nearby which is also on the cylinder .",
    "sometimes , the local connecting orbit has to be the type looks like heterclinic orbit ( arnold s mechanism ) , sometimes the local connecting orbit has to be constructed by using cohomology equivalence . however , due to the work of @xcite , one can always connects such aubry set to another one via arnold s mechanism .",
    "certain hlder modulus continuity of weak kam solutions is established in @xcite for the whole cylinder , not only restricted on the set of invariant circles .",
    "therefore , we have found transition chain along the resonant path with only finitely gaps around the strong double resonant points .",
    "these gaps have very small size like @xmath1186 with @xmath720 . in another paper @xcite ,",
    "we show how to build up a transition chain of cohomology equivalence to cross the double resonance .",
    "we note that it was announced by mather @xcite more than ten years ago .",
    "* acknowledgement * the main content of this paper comes from the previous preprint @xcite which seems quite long .",
    "the author splits it into several parts with modifications so that they are easier to read .",
    "this paper is one of them ."
