    "the dynamics of confined cavity fields interacting with the cavity wall is of great interest for the understanding of a variety of problems such as hadron bag models @xcite , sonoluminescence @xcite , cavity qed @xcite and black hole radiations @xcite .",
    "most previous studies on dynamical cavity concentrated on scalar or photon fields @xcite , which despite the apparent simplicity , exhibit rich and complex dynamics .",
    "in contrast , the system of a schrdinger particle in an oscillating spherical cavity has not gained as much attention . in this article",
    ", we study the generalized quantum geometric phase of a particle in resonance with the vibrating cavity .",
    "we will show that the geometric phase acquires sudden @xmath0-jumps when the particle makes transitions .",
    "the geometric phase of a quantum system has drawn much attention since it was first proposed by berry in 1984 @xcite .",
    "it reveals the geometric structure of the hilbert space of the system @xcite , and its existence in physical systems has been verified in many experiments @xcite , including electron diffraction from a screw dislocation @xcite and neutron interferometry @xcite .",
    "the phase effects in molecular physics can lead to energy splittings and shift quantum numbers .",
    "the geometric phase has also been shown to be intimately connected to the physics of fractional statistics , the quantized hall effect , and anomalies in gauge theory @xcite . as far as we know , our study represents the first calculation of the geometric phase of a resonating system , which evolves non - adiabatically and non - cyclically .",

    "the coordinates can be transformed to a fixed domain via @xmath4 , and , to preserve unitarity , the wavefunction is renormalized through @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( 3/2 ) , for a cylindrical ( spherical ) well .",
    "since the full hamiltonian @xmath7 commutes with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the wavefunction can be factorized : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 depends only on the angular variables . inside the cavity ,",
    "the radial wavefunction satisfies @xmath12y,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the particle mass , and @xmath14 , 2 and @xmath15 for cylindrical and spherical wells respectively . in this paper",

    "the wavefunction described by eq .",
    "[ d.r.e ] evolves in time and acquires a time - dependent phase , which in general consists of a dynamical phase and a geometric one @xcite .",
    "when the dynamics is adiabatic and/or the evolution is cyclic , the geometric phase , or berry s phase , has been studied for many systems . since we are interested in the geometric phase of a non - adiabatic , non - cyclic system , we have to resort to a generalized method .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we first remove the dynamical phase from the wavefunction of the system : @xmath17 , the dynamical phase is @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the general setting geometric phase , or the pancharatnam phase @xmath20 is defined as the relative phase between the state at time @xmath21 and that at time @xmath22 , both with the dynamical phase removed .",
    "it can be obtained from the inner product of these two states @xmath23 our main goal in this paper is to study this geometric phase for a simple but nontrivial dynamical system .",
    "we have solved eq .  [ d.r.e ] numerically and checked that the solution is stable and converges very well . in fig .  1 , we show the maximum energy of the particle as a function of the driving frequency @xmath24 , both having been scaled to be dimensionless : @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the particle is initially in the ground state , and it is in resonance at specific values of @xmath27 . in each period of cavity vibration @xmath28",
    ", the geometric phase acquires some changes , @xmath29 , and it exhibits oscillations at these resonances .",
    "we show three examples in fig .  2 for @xmath30 and 22.21227 , where the geometric phase acquires periodic changes of @xmath31 respectively .",
    "all the resonances shown in fig .",
    "1 are associated with oscillations of @xmath32 with amplitudes of @xmath33 , @xmath34 .    to understand the resonances and the associated geometric phases , we limit ourselves to the parameter regime where the hamiltonian can be truncated to a two - level system . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath35 , and the initial state is the @xmath36 unperturbed eigenstate @xmath37 , with eigenenergy @xmath38 , then when the driving frequency corresponds to the energy difference between the initial state and another unperturbed eigenstate @xmath39 , with eigenenergy @xmath40 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath41 , the particle is expected to behave as in a two - level system .",
    "then the problem simplifies considerably , and we have obtained its solution with two analytic approaches : the su(2 ) method and the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .    following cheng _",
    "et al._@xcite we first expand the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath7 of a two - level system in the identity operator @xmath42 , the raising and lowering operators @xmath43 , and pauli spin matrix @xmath44 @xmath45 ,     \\label{eq.h(t)}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , are in general complex functions of time . the evolution operator can then be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 with the initial conditions @xmath51 for @xmath521 , 2 , or 3 .",

    "the spirit of the rwa is to retain only those terms in the hamiltonian that correspond to the resonance frequency .",

    ", we keep only terms with the _ lowest _ frequency for each @xmath24 , the rationale being that @xmath66 and @xmath67 vary slowly in time and the contributions to @xmath68 from high frequency terms cancel on average over such a long time scale .",
    "it is clear then from eq .",
    "[ w ] that @xmath68 is largest if @xmath69 , with @xmath70 an integer , because of the emergence of zero frequency terms . for these driving frequencies",

    "the rwa results are virtually identical with those of the su(2 ) method . fig .",
    "1 can be understood completely in terms of overlapping series of the @xmath90 resonances , and the positions of the peaks are in almost exact agreement with the rwa or su(2 ) predictions .",
    "the resonance line shapes are well fitted by the lorentzian eq .",
    "[ transform.emax ] , though the widths are underpredicted for the @xmath91 resonances , as shown in table 1 .",
    "for example , the @xmath92 resonance has a much larger width than predicted by rwa and su(2 ) , which is mainly due to the involvement of other states during transition , such as a @xmath93 process , which is second order in perturbation theory and so affects the @xmath94 transitions more severely .",
    "occasionally , resonances at similar frequencies may overlap and lead to broadened widths .    at a resonance , the rabi oscillations of the particle as predicted in rwa ( eq .  [ approx.et.1 ] )",
    "can be seen explicitly in fig .  2 , where the energy of the particle vs.  time is shown for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the rwa also predicts that at exact resonances , @xmath97 , and therefore the oscillation periods should be inversely proportional to the widths of the resonances , @xmath98 .",
    "as shown in the last column of table 1 , this is clearly borne out in the numerical data , where @xmath99 is listed and is found to be closed to 1 for all resonances , deviating by less than 10% for even those with strong mixing .    using the rwa and two - level approximation",
    ", we can calculate the dynamical phase easily . removing the dynamical phase with the help of eq .",
    "[ approx.et.1 ] , we have @xmath100 where @xmath101 . for @xmath69 resonances , if we choose @xmath102 to be an integral multiple , @xmath103 , of the cavity oscillation period @xmath104 , we get @xmath105 , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath106 . in particular ,",

    "both of these rwa predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical data , as shown in fig .  2 .",
