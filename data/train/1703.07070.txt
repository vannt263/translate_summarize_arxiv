    "many tests of symmetry of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) sky have revealed unexplained anomalies on large angular scales , namely among low multipoles .",
    "many low multipoles are plagued with anomalous features , associated with a breakdown of isotropy , with significances that varied between different data releases @xcite . in some cases",
    "the anomalies have been attributed to statistical flukes .",
    "however , they have received significant interest from the cosmology community by way of alternate or independent analyses towards understanding these peculiarities ( see for example ref .",
    "regardless of interpretation , the large scale anomalies have persisted from wmap to planck mission data , where the science teams pursued them with no final conclusion @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we uncover yet another peculiarity associated with low multipole cmb data .",
    "we compare the alignments of parity - even and parity - odd multipoles separately to explore any preferred directions associated with each .",
    "the significances of these directions point to a particular parity preference present in the data , and possible clues about their relation to other large angle cmb anomalies .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an anomalous point ( inversion ) parity asymmetry was reported to be present in cmb data at low@xmath6 .",
    "odd multipoles of the cmb were found to have significantly more power compared to the even multipoles in the angular power spectrum from wmap seven year data , following an earlier analysis that used wmap first year data @xcite .",

    "however it was found to be significantly lower than ` @xmath15 ' with a probability - to - exceed the observed value in data reaching a minimum of @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "this was followed by other studies confirming the anomalous nature of this parity asymmetry @xcite . in the planck 2015 analysis @xcite",
    ", the @xmath18value of this asymmetry was evaluated to be @xmath19 at @xmath20 , depending on the specific component separation method used to extract the cmb signal .",
    "the directionality of this parity asymmetry was probed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the ratio @xmath21 and its variants were computed in different sky directions to obtain a map of the even - odd power asymmetry with a chosen @xmath9 .",
    "curiously , the minimum of the odd parity excess statistic , @xmath21 , was found to occur in the direction of the cmb dipole .",
    "here we analyse the even and odd multipoles separately in a wider multipole range , to explore any preferred directions associated with these point parity ( a)symmetry modes .",
    "the power tensor is a robust diagnostic to test isotropy of cmb data @xcite .",
    "the cmb temperature is conventionally expanded in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath22 : @xmath23 here @xmath24 are the spherical harmonic coefficients , @xmath25 denotes the cmb temperature anisotropies after subtracting the monopole and dipole , and @xmath26 is the position vector on the dome of the sky .    in dirac notation ,",
    "the coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansion are @xmath27 where @xmath28 represent eigenstates of the angular momentum operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 . under a small rotation , the @xmath24 s change to @xmath31 where the infinitesimal change is given by @xmath32 . here",

    "the corresponding statistic @xmath37 we call the _ power tensor _ , is defined as @xmath38 under the assumption of statistical isotropy , different spherical harmonic coefficients are uncorrelated i.e. , @xmath39 , and hence @xmath40 .",
    "thus , in an ensemble , realizations of an uncorrelated , statistically isotropic cmb sky , the eigenvalues of the power tensor are randomly distributed about the mean value of @xmath41 .",
    "the power tensor eigenvectors are also distributed uniformly over the sky .    in any given realization",

    "the pev s make it possible to compare the _ orientations _ of different multipoles , which _ a priori",
    "_ contain information , that is independent of the power .",
    "a typical statistic is the dot - product - squared of pev s from two distinct multipoles @xmath47 and @xmath53 . squaring the dot - product",

    "the significance of anisotropy represented by this axis is measured using alignment entropy by computing the lower tail probability deduced from simulations in comparison to the observed entropy value from data .",
    "we also study alignments in cumulative multipole bins , by varying the upper and lower end of the @xmath71range being considered .",
    "for this study we use the full sky commander cmb map derived from planck 2015 data that is made publicly available .",

    "since we are interested in large angular scales , this is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "we also prepare the mock data in the same way .",
    "the planck collaboration has also provided sets of cmb realizations that have the appropriate instrument effects such as beam smoothing , as well as noise realizations for public use .",
    "these are referred to as full focal plane ( ffp ) simulations .",
    "we use the ffp8 and ffp8.1 simulation sets for our purpose .",
    "the set ffp8 was an initial release that complements the planck 2015 full mission data release .",
    "however due to a slight mismatch in the theoretical power spectrum of cmb used to generate these realizations , with the angular power spectrum consistent with final planck 2015 cosmological parameters , the cmb realizations were updated with a new set denoted as ffp8.1 that match planck 2015 cosmology @xcite",
    ". hence we use simulated cmb skies from the set ffp8.1 , but will use the ffp8 realizations for noise .",
    "the ffp simulations of cmb and noise that are provided , correspond to a specific frequency channel , and are not readily usable .",
    "these simulation sets do not constitute individual component separated maps corresponding to various cleaning algorithms used by planck such as commander , smica , etc .",
    ", to obtain clean cmb maps from the raw satellite data @xcite . thus , to obtain a set of realistic cmb maps , we process this ensemble of multi - channel maps as follows .",
    "we downgrade all the cmb and noise realizations to a common resolution of healpix @xmath73 , and smooth to have a uniform beam resolution of @xmath74 ( degrees ) gaussian beam .",
    "we apply the healpix facilities anafast , alteralm and synfast in that order to bring them to the afore mentioned common ` healpix ` resolution and beam smoothing .",
    "we used the circularized beam transfer functions corresponding to each planck frequency channel , that are provided with the second public release of planck data .",
    "we then compute the noise rms corresponding to each channel using these smoothed / downgraded realizations .",
    "these noise rms maps are used to combine the smoothed / downgraded individual frequency specific cmb and noise realizations through inverse noise variance weighting .",
    "thus we are considering only the diagonal part of the full covariance matrix that results from beam smoothing .",
    "however since we are interested in studying large angular scales , the coadded cmb and effective noise maps thus obtained would sufficiently represent the observed sky .",
    "a set of 1000 cmb and noise monte carlo realizations are provided with appropriate instrument and noise characteristics through planck public release  2 .",
    "correspondingly we generate 1000 co - added cmb maps with noise from the ffp realizations following this procedure .",

    "<S> an excess power in odd multipoles compared to even multipoles has previously been found on large angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this apparent parity asymmetry , we evaluate directional statistics associated with even compared to odd multipoles , along with their significances . </S>",
    "<S> primary tools are the _ power tensor _ and _ alignment tensor _ statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we limit our analysis to the first sixty multipoles i.e. , @xmath0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for statistically unusual alignments of even parity multipoles . </S>",
    "<S> more than one independent statistic finds evidence for alignments of anisotropy axes of odd multipoles , with a significance equivalent to @xmath1 or more . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of alignment axes is tested by making galactic cuts and varying the multipole range . very interestingly , the region spanned by the ( a)symmetry axes is found to broadly contain other parity ( a)symmetry axes previously observed in the literature .    </S>",
