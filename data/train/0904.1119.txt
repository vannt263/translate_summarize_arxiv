    "this theory was generalized in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    using a slightly different notion of renormalization ,",

    "this kind of control is obviously connected with regularity properties of the flow ( differentiability for instance ) , which were studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the idea",

    "on the other hand , @xmath411 and this last term is bounded by @xmath412 where we have used that , for any @xmath413 , @xmath414 , and where the last inequality can be obtained by a spherical coordinate change of variable centered at @xmath2 in the variable @xmath415 in the first term , and centered at @xmath415 in the variable @xmath2 in the second term .",
    "now , @xmath416 and integrating first in @xmath415 and @xmath417 , this is equal to @xmath418 therefore @xmath419 where we write the vector @xmath3 as @xmath420 in an orthonormal basis of @xmath4 with first vector @xmath421 . in conclusion",
    "@xmath422 combining this inequality with  ( [ eq : bourrin ] ) , we finally get @xmath423      applying to @xmath425 the same change of variable as we did for @xmath426 , we have @xmath427 where @xmath428 for any matrix @xmath429 , @xmath430 and @xmath431 note that , because of the properties of @xmath432 obtained in section  [ sec : cv - z ] , @xmath433 for some constant @xmath63 .",
    "now , we observe from  ( [ eq : def - b1-b2 ] ) that @xmath465 has exactly the same structure as @xmath466 : a singularity of order @xmath58 in @xmath415 , a function @xmath467 that has all the required regularity , and a term @xmath468 .",
    "it is then easy to see that this term can be treated by exactly the same method as @xmath466 .",
    "we leave the details to the reader .",
    "finally , the term @xmath471 of  ( [ eq : def - c ] ) can be bounded exactly as @xmath318 by simply exchanging the roles of @xmath472 and @xmath473 .",
