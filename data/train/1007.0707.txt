    "the diffraction measure is a characteristic property of a translation bounded measure @xmath1 on euclidean space ( or on any locally compact abelian group ) and has important applications in crystallography because it describes the outcome of kinematic diffraction ( from x - rays or neutron scattering , say ) .",
    "it is the fourier transform @xmath2 of the autocorrelation measure @xmath3 of @xmath1 .",
    "following the discovery of quasicrystals ( which are generally non - periodic but nevertheless show pure point or bragg diffraction ) , measures with pure point diffraction have been investigated thoroughly . in parallel ,",
    "there has also been progress in understanding singular continuous and absolutely continuous diffraction ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "let us mention in passing that making a connection with the spectra of schrdinger operators is tempting , but has so far eluded all attempts to substantiate it .    in this article , within the realm of pure point diffractive systems , we consider two examples of limit periodic structures , the period doubling sequence in one dimension ( section [ sec : pd ] ) and point sets related to the chair tiling in two dimensions ( section [ sec : chair ] ) .",
    "the corresponding point sets arise from fixed points of ( block ) substitution rules , but also have a description as cut and project sets with @xmath4-adic internal spaces .",
    "we begin with a concise survey of the relevant quantities , where we restrict ourselves to measures that are supported on integer lattices .",
    "then , the two main examples are presented in an informal way , though all results are rigorous ( with the underlying mathematical framework being available via @xcite ) .",
    "a more detailed exposition will appear in @xcite .",
    "consider the ( weighted ) dirac comb @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the normalised point ( or dirac ) measure at @xmath7 and ( in general , complex ) weights @xmath8 .",

    "the latter is a positive , translation bounded measure on @xmath10 ( by the bochner - schwartz theorem ) , which is known as the _ diffraction measure _ of @xmath1 .",
    "it corresponds to the ( kinematic ) diffraction from the measure @xmath1 ; compare @xcite for background and @xcite for this approach to diffraction theory .",
    "the diffraction measure possesses the unique decomposition @xmath22 into its pure point , singular continuous and absolutely continuous parts , the latter splitting relative to lebesgue measure , the natural reference measure for volume in euclidean space .",
    "lattice periodic measures in @xmath10 give rise to pure point diffraction , as do regular model sets with euclidean internal space @xmath23 , where the diffraction measure is supported on a @xmath24-module of finite rank @xmath25 ; see @xcite and references therein for more .",
    "the examples discussed below are also based on model sets , but with @xmath4-adic internal spaces ; they are _ limit periodic _ , and thus exhibit pure point diffraction where the corresponding fourier module is countably , but not finitely generated . for both examples , the explicit form of the diffraction can be obtained either from the cut and project description @xcite or from the inflation structure @xcite ; in this note , we use the latter approach .",
    "the _ period doubling sequence _ is defined by the primitive substitution rule @xmath26 on the two - letter alphabet @xmath27 .",
    "it is related to the classic thue - morse system ( as a factor under a @xmath28 mapping ; compare @xcite and references therein ) and defines a strictly ergodic dynamical system via the orbit closure of a suitable bi - infinite sequence .",
    "the latter can be obtained from a fixed point of @xmath29 via the iteration @xmath30 with convergence in the ( obvious ) product topology .",
    "here , @xmath31 marks the origin of a two - sided sequence @xmath32 , and we start with the legal seed @xmath33 .",

    "to the sequence @xmath36 , we associate two point sets @xmath37 with @xmath38 via @xmath39 so @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the disjoint union of sets .",
    "the geometric fixed point equation for @xmath29 now implies the equations    @xmath42    which can be decoupled and solved by iteration , yielding @xmath43 where the singleton set @xmath44 has to be added to the fixed point ( to either @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) , as it is only a limit point under @xmath4-adic completion @xcite .",
    "we attach a dirac comb to @xmath47 by @xmath48 for @xmath38 . a general weighted dirac comb with weights @xmath49 ( for letter @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( for letter @xmath52 )",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath53 .",
    "its autocorrelation measure exists and has the form of eq .",
    "( with @xmath54 ) with autocorrelation coefficients @xmath20 according to , where the weight @xmath55 is chosen according to the letter at position @xmath56 .    for simplicity , we work with the one - sided fixed point @xmath57 ( which has the same autocorrelation ) .",
    "we first consider weights @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and denote the autocorrelation coefficients for this balanced case by @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding sequence @xmath61 of weights @xmath62 satisfies the recursions @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "this implies a recursion for the autocorrelation coefficients , @xmath66 for all @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , @xmath68 , and we also have @xmath69 . when @xmath70 with @xmath71 , the recursion leads to @xmath72 which is independent of @xmath73 .",
    "going back to general weights @xmath49 and @xmath51 amounts to considering the bi - infinite sequence @xmath74 , or alternatively @xmath75 for its one - sided counterpart , which results in @xmath76 taking the fourier transform , the diffraction measure is obtained as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the _ fourier module _ of the period doubling sequence .",
    "the amplitudes read @xmath79 where we implicitly refer to the parametrisation of @xmath80 .    to derive these formulas",
    ", one observes that a finite union in eq .   would still be a periodic set , whose diffraction can be calculated by direct fourier transform ( which is then a periodic point measure ) followed by taking the absolute square of the amplitudes ( note that the wiener diagram is still commutative in this case ) .",
    "this results in a sequence of pure point measures that converge not only in the vague topology , but also in the stronger norm topology towards the diffraction measure in , with the amplitudes as in ; see @xcite for details . since pure point measures are closed in the norm topology ,",
    "this also gives the constructive proof that @xmath80 is indeed the fourier module .",
    "as mentioned above , the same result can also be derived via the description of the periodic doubling sequence as a model set with @xmath4-adic internal space ; see @xcite for a proof .",
    "a sketch of the diffraction pattern is shown in figure  [ fig : pddiff ] .     from eq .",
    "for the period doubling chain , with @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the diffraction pattern repeats @xmath24-periodically along the real line @xcite.[fig : pddiff],scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the presence of the powers of @xmath82 in the fourier module shows the limit periodic structure ; since @xmath73 can be arbitrarily large , the fourier module can not be finitely generated .",
    "nevertheless , the diffraction measure is pure point , with amplitudes that reflect the inflation symmetry with integer multiplier @xmath4 , as visible in figure  [ fig : pddiff ] .",
    "let us move on to our planar example .",

    "this sequence thus converges in the product topology , where the limit is a fixed point of the block substitution rule that covers the entire square lattice .",
    "this fixed point has a @xmath86 colour symmetry : an anti - clockwise rotation through @xmath87 corresponds to the cyclic permutation @xmath88 , while a reflection in the central horizontal gives the permutation @xmath89 .",
    "the pattern is thus invariant under any @xmath86 transformation followed by an appropriate permutation .    if we choose a representation with four different unit squares and take the lower left corners as their reference points , the fixed point defined by results in a partition @xmath90 of @xmath91 into four point sets of equal density @xmath92 . as a result of",

    ", we have @xmath98 , as well as @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this leads to the decoupled equations @xmath101 together with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "an explicit solution is ( with @xmath104 for sets @xmath105 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 )    [ eq : chairsol ] @xmath108    where we used @xmath109 .",
    "each of the infinite unions on the right - hand side defines a point set of density @xmath92 .",
    "the sets of points ( of density @xmath110 ) along the diagonals have to be added for our fixed point , because they are not contained in any of the lattice translates ( but are covered by the @xmath4-adic completion of the infinite unions , similar to the situation of the period doubling sequence ) .",
    "the solutions obey the relations @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "now , we are going to calculate the diffraction measure of the dirac comb @xmath113 with the four point sets @xmath114 from eq .  , and arbitrary complex numbers @xmath115 .",
    "define @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 . using @xmath119 ( where the superscript @xmath120 denotes the dual lattice ) ,",

    "the first fraction evaluates as @xmath123 whenever @xmath124 ( by an application of the lhospital rule ) .",
    "the resulting fourier module is @xmath125 which is the coarsest group that contains all positions where the fourier transform in has a point measure .",
    "the diffraction measure of our weighted dirac comb @xmath1 is of the form @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the amplitude that belongs to @xmath128 .",
    "its derivation is analogous to the method explained above for the period doubling sequence ( via periodic approximants that converge in the norm topology ) .",

    "in addition , the results have to be multiplied by an overall phase factor that reflects the translation vectors on the left - hand sides of the four relations in eq .  .",
    "we omit the detailed ( and somewhat lengthy ) calculations and simply state the result .    to this end",
    ", the integer and half - integer points of @xmath80 are better treated separately .",

    "similarly , one obtains the relation @xmath163 together with @xmath164 in particular , @xmath165 leads to @xmath166 , as required .",
    "moreover , setting @xmath167 and @xmath168 gives the diffraction @xmath169 , while the alternative choice @xmath170 together with @xmath171 yields ( using the parametrisation of @xmath122 as above ) @xmath172 .",

    "the complete pattern is @xmath175-periodic.[fig : chairdiff],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    an interesting case results from the balanced choice @xmath176 , which produces extinctions for all @xmath177 .",
    "the corresponding diffraction measure is illustrated in figure  [ fig : chairdiff ] .",
    "it is @xmath178-symmetric , which is not the case in general .    for a generic choice of the weights ,",
    "our dirac comb is mutually locally derivable ( mld ) with the chair tiling .",
    "as it is based on four subsets of @xmath91 , the diffraction measure @xmath179 is always @xmath91-periodic @xcite .",
    "this is the generic maximal translation symmetry .",
    "however , since @xmath180 , the diffraction of any weighted dirac comb with only these two components is periodic under the dual lattice @xmath119 . likewise , the corresponding statement holds for the diffraction of weighted dirac combs with components @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "this is also the translation symmetry in figure  [ fig : chairdiff ] , which is a consequence of the particular choice of the weights here .",
    "any choice of the weights refers to a discrete structure that can be viewed as a decoration of the chair tiling , and is thus locally derivable from it .",
    "conversely , a typical decoration of the chair tiling will be locally derivable from our coloured point set , but need not be realisable as a simple decoration of the square - shaped building blocks . in this sense , our above results constitute only a first step of the complete diffraction analysis of the chair tiling .",
    "limit periodic structures form an interesting class of pure point diffractive systems .",
    "explicit results for the diffraction can be obtained , at least for examples such as those discussed in this paper ; related examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "limit periodic tilings also arise in the context of wang tiles .",
    "raphael robinson s tilings consisting of six square - shaped prototiles @xcite , up to rotations and reflections , is one example . in this case",
    ", the limit periodic structure is apparent from a hierarchical pattern of interlocking squares of larger and larger sizes .",
    "recently , a similar tiling with a single hexagonal prototile , up to rotations and reflections , was discovered @xcite , with a hierarchical pattern of interlocking triangles .",
    "it is related to the half - hex inflation that was studied in detail in @xcite , where also its limit - periodic structure was derived , and to penrose s @xmath183 tiling @xcite .",
    "the new example is particularly intriguing because the hexagon is the first example of a single aperiodic tile ( provided you count the tile and its mirror image as a single tile ) , in the sense that there exist local rules that allow the existence of tilings covering the entire plane , but no such tiling can have any non - trivial period .",
    "the local rules involve not just neighbours , but also the next corona , and thus can not be encapsulated in the shape of a tile whose interior is connected ; see @xcite for details",
    ". it would be interesting to study the diffraction properties of these tilings , which will reflect the limit periodic structure apparent in the patterns of squares and triangles .",
