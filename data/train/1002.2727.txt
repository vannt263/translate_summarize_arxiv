    "hamiltonian boundary value methods ( hbvms ) form a subclass of boundary value methods ( bvms ) , whose main feature is that of precisely conserving the hamiltonian function associated with a canonical hamiltonian system @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the identity matrix of dimension @xmath2 ) , in the case where such function is of polynomial type .",
    "two key ideas have permitted the realization of hbvms : the definition of _ discrete line integral _ and what we called _ extended collocation conditions_. the former , first introduced in @xcite , represents the discrete counterpart of the line integral defined over conservative vector fields , while the second is a relaxation of the classical collocation conditions which assures the conservation of the energy along the numerical solution @xmath3 generated by the method itself .    just as an initial clarification",
    ", we briefly show how this new approach to the problem reads when the classical gauss collocation method is considered ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.1 ) for more details ) . given a stepsize @xmath4 and a set of @xmath5 abscissae @xmath6 disposed according to a gauss - legendre distribution on @xmath7 $ ] , the gauss method of order @xmath8",
    "is defined by means of the following polynomial collocation problem : @xmath9 \\dot \\sigma(t_0+c_i h)= j",
    "\\nabla h(\\sigma(t_0+c_i h ) ) , & i=1,\\dots , s .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] as is well known , conditions uniquely define a polynomial @xmath10 of degree @xmath5 which is used to advance the solution by posing @xmath11 , while the internal stages satisfy @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficients of the butcher array and the weights are given by @xmath14 the @xmath5-degree polynomial @xmath10 may be thought of as a path in the phase space linking the state vectors @xmath15 to @xmath16 and passing through the stages @xmath17 . due to the conservative nature of the vector field",
    ", we have that @xmath18 now , the above integral is exactly computed by the gauss quadrature formula with abscissae @xmath19 and weights @xmath20 if the degree of the integrand is not greater than @xmath21 which means that the degree of @xmath22 , say @xmath23 , must not exceed @xmath24 ( linear or quadratic hamiltonians only ) . under this assumption , taking into account the collocation conditions , we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "thus , by following a different route , we have obtained the classical result that the gauss methods conserve quadratic hamiltonian functions while fails to conserve polynomial hamiltonian functions of higher degree .",
    "the above example is the starting point of our approach : the _ discrete line integral _ is the first sum in , which turns out to vanish for quadratic hamiltonians , due to the collocation conditions .",
    "the next section reports a descriptive introduction to hbvms with much emphasis to the key ideas they rely on .",
    "we refer the reader to the papers @xcite for the details about the basic theory and implementation of hbvms , and to the monograph @xcite as a reference for the theory of bvms .",
    "in section [ test_sec ] we report a number of test problems of some relevance in the literature , for which the precise conservation of the energy turns out to be a crucial feature for the correct reproduction of the long time behavior of the solutions .",
    "this will be testified by comparing hbvms to gauss methods which , by the way , are symplectic integrators .",
    "in this section we introduce hbvms by slightly elaborating the arguments in @xcite . as said above , the basic idea which hbvms rely on",
    "is the so called discrete line integral , which is the discrete counterpart of the line integral associated with a conservative vector field . in more detail , starting from ( [ 1 ] ) , we consider a polynomial , of degree at most @xmath5 , such that @xmath27    providing an approximation to the solution on the interval @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "we consider the following expansions , @xmath29    where the ( vector ) coefficients @xmath30 are to be determined .",
    "we also assume that the polynomials @xmath31 constitute an orthonormal basis , on the interval @xmath7 $ ] , for the vector space @xmath32 of polynomials of degree at most @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34    with @xmath35 the kronecker symbol .",
    "such polynomials can be easily obtained by a suitable scaling of the shifted legendre polynomials @xcite .",
    "substituting the first expansion in ( [ s1s ] ) into the line integral in ( [ 1 ] ) , and requiring the resulting expression to vanish , then gives    @xmath36    which is certainly satisfied by choosing    @xmath37    multiplication of ( [ ccj ] ) by @xmath38 and summation over @xmath39 then gives , by virtue of the second expansion in ( [ s1s ] ) ,    @xmath40.\\ ] ]    let us now assume that @xmath22 is a polynomial of degree @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the integral appearing at the right - hand side in ( [ infhbvm ] ) can be exactly discretized by a gaussian formula over @xmath41 gauss - legendre abscissae @xmath19 , which we shall consider hereafter , provided that @xmath42    let us denote by @xmath43 the weights of the quadrature formula in the interval @xmath7 $ ] , and set@xmath44    consequently , ( [ infhbvm ] ) can be ( exactly ) discretized as : @xmath45    [ hbvmdef ] the set of equations ( [ hbvmks ] ) , to be solved for the unknowns @xmath46 , defines an _ hbvm with @xmath41 steps and degree @xmath5 _ , in short hbvm@xmath47 .",
    "for such a method , the following properties hold true @xcite :    * it has order @xmath8 for all @xmath48 ; * it is symmetric and perfectly @xmath49-stable ( i.e. , its stability region coincides with the left - half complex plane , @xmath50 @xcite ) ; * for @xmath51 , it reduces to the gauss - legendre method of order @xmath8 ; * it exactly preserves polynomial hamiltonian functions of degree @xmath23 , provided that ( [ kk ] ) holds true .    the actual implementation of hbvm@xmath47 can be seen to result in the solution of a system of ( block ) size @xmath5 , whatever is the value of @xmath41 considered @xcite . consequently , if needed , large values of @xmath41 can be easily considered .",
    "the arguments in the previous remark , allow us to consider the limit formula of ( [ yiaij])([hbvmks ] ) , in the case where @xmath22 is non - polynomial , as @xmath52 .",
    "clearly such a limit is given by formula ( [ infhbvm ] ) , which , according to @xcite , is named _ hbvm@xmath53 _ or _",
    "@xmath54-hbvm of degree @xmath5_.    however , we emphasize that formula ( [ infhbvm ] ) becomes an operative method only after that a suitable discretization of the inner integral is considered and , replacing the integral by a quadrature formula with @xmath41 nodes , leads back to a hbvm@xmath47 method .",
    "one can easily argue that , since in the non polynomial case the quadrature formula can approximate the corresponding integral with an arbitrary accuracy , under suitable regularity assumptions for @xmath22 , a _ practical _ conservation of the energy may be obtained @xcite .",
    "the term `` practical '' means that , in many general situations , when @xmath41 is high enough , the method makes no distinction between the function @xmath22 and its polynomial approximation , being the latter in a neighborhood of size @xmath55 of the former , where @xmath55 denotes the machine precision .",
    "we end this section by observing that , by differentiating both members of ( [ infhbvm ] ) , one obtains @xmath56,\\ ] ]    which at the points @xmath19 provides , assuming @xmath22 to be a polynomial and @xmath41 large enough : @xmath57    such formulae ( the former being the limit of the latter as @xmath52 ) can be regarded as a kind of _ extended collocation conditions _ that generalize conditions , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section2 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we present a few numerical test highlighting the good behavior of hbvms in the long - time simulation of hamiltonian systems .",
    "a direct comparison of hbvms with gauss methods is reported in order to better emphasize the stability properties of the former methods even when compared to a well known class of symplectic formulae .",
    "coincides with hbvm(@xmath5,@xmath5 ) . ]",
    "the use of a large stepsize of integration is a prerogative in long - time simulation of an evolutionary problem but , in general , one is forced to reduce @xmath58 under a critical threshold in order to guarantee the qualitative behavior of the theoretical solution to be well reproduced by the numerical solution . from this point of view",
    ", we show that hbvms allow the use of larger stepsizes than gauss methods , which states that the conservation of the hamiltonian function plays an important role in detecting the correct topological features of the solutions .",
    "one of the main problems in celestial mechanics is to describe the motion of @xmath59 point particles of positive mass @xmath60 moving under newton s law of gravitation when we know their positions @xmath61 and momenta @xmath62 at a given time .",
    "such a dynamical system , called the @xmath59-body problem , is in the form , with hamiltonian @xmath63 with @xmath64 the gravitational constant . while the two - body problem is completely solved in the sense that we can describe explicitly all its solutions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , this is no more the case , for @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , numerical simulation is of interest , in such a case .",
    "the sitnikov problem is a particular configuration of the @xmath66-body dynamics . in this problem",

    "the main question related to this model was to state the existence of a third first integral , beside the total energy and the angular momentum . by exploiting the symmetry of the system and the conservation of the angular momentum , hnon and heiles reduced from three ( cylindrical coordinates ) to two ( planar coordinates ) the degrees of freedom , thus showing that the problem was equivalent to the study of the motion of a particle in a plane subject to an arbitrary potential @xmath79 : @xmath80     of the hnon - heiles problem ( see ) .",

    "hnon and heiles conducted a series of tests with the aim of giving a numerical evidence of the existence of such integral for moderate values of the energy @xmath88 , and of the appearance of chaotic behavior when @xmath89 becomes larger than a critical value . in particular , for their experiments they choose @xmath90 which makes the hamiltonian function a polynomial of degree three .",

    "<S> hamiltonian boundary value methods are a new class of energy preserving one step methods for the solution of polynomial hamiltonian dynamical systems </S>",
    "<S> . they can be thought of as a generalization of collocation methods in that they may be defined by imposing a suitable set of _ extended collocation conditions_. in particular , in the way they are described in this note , they are related to gauss collocation methods with the difference that they are able to precisely conserve the hamiltonian function in the case where this is a polynomial of any high degree in the momenta and in the generalized coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> a description of these new formulas is followed by a few test problems showing how , in many relevant situations , the precise conservation of the hamiltonian is crucial to simulate on a computer the correct behavior of the theoretical solutions . </S>"
