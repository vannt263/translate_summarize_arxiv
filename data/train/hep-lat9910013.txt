    "the attempt to get around the `` no - go '' theorem @xcite for the `` vector - like '' phenomenon of chiral fermions on a lattice is currently a very important issue of theoretical particle physics(@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "one attempt is the approach of multifermion couplings , which can be traced back from the recent lattice formulation of the standard model@xcite to the pioneer model suggested by eichten and preskill in ref.@xcite and successive work@xcite in the past years .",
    "however , on the other hand , it was pointed out in an crucial paper@xcite that the models proposed in ref.@xcite fail to give chiral fermions in the continuum limit .",
    "the reasons are that a nambu - jona lasinio ( njl)@xcite spontaneous symmetry breaking phase separates the strong - coupling symmetric phase from the weak - coupling symmetric phase , and the right - handed weyl states do not completely disassociate from the left - handed chiral fermions .",
    "further , another crucial paper@xcite tried to extent the `` no - go '' theorem into interacting theories based on the plausible argument of such theories being local .",
    "the definite failure of the models so constructed has then been a general belief@xcite and it has been very doubtful that exact chiral gauge symmetries could be realized in a lattice .",
    "nevertheless , based on the consistency of the rome - approach@xcite to an @xmath3chiral gauge theory on the lattice and physical nature of chiralities and the cutoff(lattice ) , we did strongly believe the existence of exact chiral gauge symmteries on the lattice and have been working on the multifermion couplings models for for many years@xcite .    for reader s convenience",
    ", we briefly describe the crucial points of the eichten and preskill @xcite idea follows .",
    "multifermion couplings are introduced such that , in the phase space of strong - couplings , weyl states composing three elementary weyl fermions ( three - fermion states ) are bound .",
    "then , these three - fermion states pair up with elementary weyl fermions to be dirac fermions .",
    "such dirac fermions can be massive without violating chiral symmetries due to the appropriate quantum numbers and chirality carried by these three - fermion states .",
    "the binding thresholds of such three - fermion states depend on elementary weyl modes residing in different regions of the brillouin zone . if one assumes that the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the njl - type does not occur and such binding thresholds separate the weak coupling symmetric phase from the strong - coupling symmetric phase , there are two possibilities to realize the continuum limit of chiral fermions in phase space .",
    "one is of crossing over the binding threshold the three - fermion state of chiral fermions .",
    "another is of a wedge between two thresholds , where the three - fermion state of chiral fermions has not been formed , provided all doublers sitting in various edges of the brillouin zone have been bound to be massive dirac fermions and decouple .",
    "we should not be surprised that a particular model of multifermion couplings does not work .",
    "this does not means that eichten and preskill s idea is definitely wrong unless there is another generalized `` no - go '' theorem on interacting theories @xcite for a whole range of coupling strength .",
    "actually , nielsen and ninomiya gave an interesting comment on eichten and preskill s idea based on their intuition of anomalies @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we believe that further considerations of constructing chiral fermions on the lattice with multifermion couplings and careful studies of the spectrum in each phase of theories so constructed are necessary . in the previous paper @xcite we illustrated a possible scaling regin for lattice chiral fermions in the phase space of multifermion couplings . in this paper , as a successive paper of @xcite we go further to demonstrate the existence of the possible scaling regin for lattice chiral fermions by computing relevant green functions and the analytical property of these green functions in the momentum space .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : section ii summarizes the main points and results of the possible scaling region found in the previous paper @xcite ; in section iii we discuss the momentum - dependent static limit and its analytical property in the momentum space , which is a crucial feature to have a possible scaling regin for lattice chiral fermions ; in section iv we discuss the notion of three - fermion - cuts in the possible scaling regin ; in section v we present very solid computations of relevant green functions relating to the three - fermion - cuts for the neutral channel and conclude that neutral chiral fermions do exist in the possible scaling regin , whic already violates the `` no - go '' theorem ; in section vi based on approximate computations of relevant green - functions relating to the three - fermion - cuts for the charged channel and the analytical property of these green - function in the momentum space , we show charged lattice chiral fermions could exist in such a scaling regin ; in section vii we discuss the crucial properties of our model to work , what and why our model are different from the eichten - preskill and smit - swift model@xcite . in the final section , we make some remarks and outlook regarding this approach to lattice chiral gauge theories .    in this paper",
    ", we are not pretending to solve all problems of lattice chiral gauge theories in this paper . if chiral fermions are gauged , the important questions concerning correct and consistent features of gauge bosons and the coupling between gauge bosons and chiral fermions are open , but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "other important questions @xcite concerning about gauge anomalies and anomalous global currents ( instanton effects and non - conservation of fermion currents ) , which eichten and preskill @xcite suggested to obtain by explicitly breaking the global symmetries associating to these currents , will be studied in separate papers .",
    "to more easily show the possibility and reason of dynamics for such constructed models to work , we further analyze the simple and anomaly - free model of multifermion couplings proposed in the ref.@xcite .",
    "note that @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is an @xmath6 gauged doublet , @xmath7 is an @xmath6 singlet and both are two - component weyl fermions .",
    "@xmath7 is treated as a `` spectator '' fermion . @xmath4 and @xmath7 fields are dimensionful @xmath8 $ ] .",

    "the global flavour symmetry @xmath23 is not explicitly broken in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) , we will not discuss the property of violating fermion number in such a model .",
    "it has been advocated@xcite there exists a plausible scaling region , which is a peculiar segment in the phase space of the multifermion couplings @xmath24 , @xmath25,\\hskip0.3 cm a^2g_2^{c , a}=0.124,\\hskip0.3 cm 1\\ll g_2^{c,\\infty } < \\infty ,   \\label{segment}\\ ] ] for chiral fermions in the low - energy limit .",
    "@xmath26 is a finite number and @xmath27 indicates the critical value above which the effective multifermion couplings associating to all doublers are strong enough , so that all doublers are gauge - invariantly decoupled .",
    "we qualitatively determined @xmath28 in ref.@xcite .",
    "the crucial points for this scaling region to exist are briefly described in the following .    in segment @xmath29 ( [ segment ] ) ,",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) possesses a @xmath7-shift - symmetry @xcite , i.e. , the action is invariant under the transformation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is independent of space - time .",
    "the ward identity corresponding to this @xmath7-shift - symmetry is given as@xcite ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33\\psi_l^i(x)\\right)\\rangle-{\\delta\\gamma\\over\\delta\\bar \\chi'_r(x)}=0 , \\label{w}\\ ] ] where the `` primed '' fields are defined through the generating functional approach , and `` @xmath34 '' is the effective potential .",
    "the important consequences of this ward identity in segment @xmath29 are :    * the low - energy mode ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath7 is a free mode and decoupled : @xmath36 * no hard spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath37 ) occurs ( see eqs.(30 ) and ( 31 ) in ref.@xcite ) ) is allowed .",
    "] , @xmath38 in addition , we have : @xmath39 which is shown by the strong coupling expansion ( see eq.(104 ) in @xcite ) .    for the strong coupling @xmath40 in the segment @xmath29 ,",
    "the following three - fermion - states comprising of the elementary fields @xmath4 and @xmath7 in ( [ action ] ) are bound : @xmath41 these fermion bound states possess the `` wrong '' chiralities in contrast with the `` right '' chiralities possessed by the elementary fields @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "the two - point green functions of these charged @xmath42 and neutral @xmath43 have poles at the total momentum @xmath44@xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . and",
    "the two - point green functions for doublers ( @xmath46 ) of the elementary fields @xmath7 and @xmath48 are given by , @xmath49 the three - fermion - states ( [ bound],[sc11],[sn11 ] ) are weyl fermions and respectively mix with the doublers of the elementary weyl fields @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( [ lp],[rp ] ) , @xmath52 as a result , the neutral @xmath53 and charged @xmath54 dirac fermions are formed , @xmath55 and the spectrum is vector - like and massive .",
    "these show that all doublers are decoupled as very massive dirac fermions consistently with the @xmath9 chiral symmetries , since the three - fermion - states ( [ bound ] ) carry the appropriate quantum numbers of the chiral groups that accommodate @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "eqs.([sc11],[sn11 ] ) for doublers is obtained by the the strong - coupling expansion in powers of @xmath56 . for the strong coupling @xmath40",
    ", the kinetic terms can be dropped and the strong - coupling limit is given as , @xmath57 [ d\\bar\\psi_l^{i\\alpha}(x ) d\\psi_l^{i\\alpha}(x)]\\exp\\left(-s_2(x)\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( 2g_2)^{4n}\\left(\\det\\delta^2(x)\\right)^4,\\hskip0.3 cm g_2\\gg 1 , \\label{stronglimit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the determent is taken only over the lattice space - time and @xmath58 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "for the non - zero eigenvalues of the operator @xmath59 ( [ wisf ] ) , which are associating to the doublers ( @xmath60 ) of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , eq .  ( [ stronglimit ] ) shows the existence of a sensible strong - coupling limit .",
    "note that the operator @xmath63 ( [ wisf],[stronglimit ] ) has different eigenvalues @xmath64 with respect to different doublers @xmath65 , and the strong coupling expansion is actually in terms of powers of @xmath66 . as the consequence ,",
    "the two - point green functions ( [ sc11]-[mx ] ) computed by the strong coupling expansion with respect to doublers should be a good approximation even for the intermediate coupling @xmath67 this discussion agrees with the qualitatively determined critical value @xmath68 in ( [ segment ] ) , above which all doublers are decoupled via eqs.([di ] ) .    however , as for the zero eigenvalues of the operator @xmath59 , which precisely correspond to the low - energy modes ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , this strong - coupling limit is trivial and the strong - coupling expansion in powers of @xmath56 breaks down .",
    "this physically means the weakness of the effective multifermion coupling for such low - energy modes of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "nevertheless , we can not exclude the possibility of low - energy modes of three - fermion - states ( [ bound ] ) , which are represented by the poles @xmath35 of the propagators ( [ sc11],[sn11 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , as a consequence of the multifermion interacting action ( [ action ] ) being local , in the strong coupling limit the effective action ( inverse propagator ) , which is bilinear in terms of interpolating fields , should be local and analytical in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "thus , the `` no - go '' theorem of nielsen and ninomiya is still applicable to this case @xcite .",
    "based on such an observation , one might argue the existence of the massless spectrum of the charged and neutral three - fermion - states ( [ bound ] ) by the analytic continuation of their propagators ( [ sc11],[sn11 ] ) from @xmath46 to @xmath35 . as a result ,",
    "the low - energy spectrum ( [ di ] ) is also vector - like .    indeed , due to the locality of action ( [ action ] ) presented in this paper",
    ", all green functions must be analytically continuous functions in energy - momentum space , provided the dynamics is fixed by given @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in the strong coupling symmetric phase ( psm ) where @xmath69 and a sensible strong - coupling limit exists , two - point green functions for three - fermion - states ( [ bound ] ) are essentially indistinguishable from that of the elementary fermion fields @xmath61 and @xmath62 appearing in the lagrangian .",
    "in such a phase , the analytical continuation of green functions for both elementary and composite fields in the whole momentum space does result in the `` vector - like '' phenomenon , as asserted by the `` no - go '' theorem for a free - fermion theory .",
    "the only loophole would appear if the propagators of interpolating fields ( three - fermion - states ) properly vanished and no longer had poles at @xmath35 .",
    "this indicates that at @xmath35 , these three - fermion - states dissolve into three - fermion - cuts , where the `` no - go '' theorem is entirely inapplicable .",
    "we discuss the concept of three - fermion - cuts in the next section .",
    "we turn to discuss how these three - fermion - states ( [ sn11],[sc11 ] ) with the `` wrong '' chiralities dissolve into three - fermion - cuts in segment @xmath29 for the low - energy limit ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "these three - fermion - cuts@xcite : @xmath71,\\hskip1 cm { \\cal c}[\\psi_r^i(x ) ] , \\label{cut}\\ ] ] are the virtual states of three individual chiral fermions with a continuous energy spectrum , provided the total momentum @xmath72 is fixed .",
    "however , these virtual states carry exactly the same quantum numbers and total momentum @xmath72 as that of three - fermion - states .",
    "thus , gauge symmetries are preserved in such a phenomenon of dissolving .",
    "the dynamics of the three - fermion - states dissolving into their virtual state is that the negative binding energy of three - fermion - states goes to zero . in the energy plane",
    ", it was shown that due to the variety of effective interactions ( potential ) , the poles for bound states can be analytically continued to the cuts for virtual states on the physical sheet@xcite .",
    "presumably , in this analytical property of effective interactions , no other dynamics , e.g. , spontaneous symmetry breaking , takes place . in segment @xmath29 , the weakness of effective multifermion couplings for the low - energy modes of @xmath48 and @xmath7 could lead to the vanishing of the binding energy of the three - fermion - states ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "we can conceive a `` dissolving '' scale ( threshold ) @xmath31 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the possible soft spontaneous symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath75 ) . from inequality ( [ disscale ] ) , we understand that no hard spontaneous symmetry breaking in segment @xmath29 is extremely crucial for the possibility of analytical continuation of propagators from poles for three - fermion - states to cuts for virtual states of three individual fermions . , we can approximately treat elementary massive fermions ( e.g.   massive particles in the standard model ) as massless particles . ]    in the relativistic lagrangian approach , to discuss the property of three - fermion - states dissolving into three - fermion - cuts , we are bound to dynamically calculate two - point functions of three - fermion - states ( fig.1 ) to identify not only their poles , but also the corresponding residues . using the strong coupling expansion , we approximately determined the simple poles for doublers ( @xmath46 ) in eqs.([sc11],[sn11 ] ) .",
    "the residues @xmath76 and @xmath77 of these simple poles are defined as , @xmath78 in fact , these residues represent the generalized form factors of three - fermion - states .",
    "the @xmath79 momentum dependence indicates that different doublers have different form factors , which implies the `` size '' of bound states is different from one doubler to another .",
    "this is clearly attributed to the momentum dependence of effective multifermion couplings in action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "if these residues @xmath80 are positive and finite constants with respect to each doubler , we can just make a wave - function renormalization of three - fermion - states with respect to each doubler , @xmath81 and the two - point green functions ( [ rsc11],[rsn11 ] ) turn into eqs.([sc11],[sn11 ] ) in terms of the renormalized fields ( [ rbound ] ) .",
    "the residues ( generalized form factors ) @xmath82 ( [ rsc11],[rsn11 ] ) of the three - fermion - states ( [ bound ] ) are given by one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) truncated green functions ( see fig.2 ) , @xmath83 the `` primed fields '' @xmath84 and @xmath85 of three - fermion - states are defined by eqs.(41 ) and ( 42 ) in ref.@xcite through the generating functional approach .",
    "these generalized form factors @xmath77 and @xmath76 give the overlap between three - fermion - operators ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) and the interpolating three - fermion - states , that appear in the space of asymptotic states of the theory in the scaling region .",
    "this description coincides with the renormalization of n - point 1pi functions with insertions of composite operators . in general , the renormalized n - point 1pi functions @xmath88 with single and two insertions of composite operators are given by@xcite , @xmath89 where @xmath90 are the regularized n - point 1pi functions and @xmath91 and @xmath92 stand for the momenta entering the composite operators . similarly given by eq.([zlzr ] ) ( fig.2)@xcite , the @xmath93 s are the generalized `` wave - function renormalizations '' of composite operators .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that for residues @xmath94 being positively finite , the wave - function renormalization of composite fields is the exactly same as the wave - function renormalization of elementary fields .",
    "in fact , composite particles are indistinguishable from elementary particles in this case . however , the normal wave - function renormalizations of elementary fields appearing in the lagrangian is attributed to the fact that these elementary fields are defined at different scales rather than their `` form factor '' .",
    "note that the elementary fields @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the action ( [ action ] ) are bare fields and have not yet been renormalized .",
    "however , in the analytical continuation of the propagators ( [ rsc11],[rsn11 ] ) in momentum space , let us assume an interesting case that the residues @xmath79 positively vanish in the limit @xmath70 for the pole @xmath35 in eqs.([rsc11 ] , [ rsn11 ] ) , @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "this property of @xmath79 could be realized by an appropriate momentum - dependence of the effective multifermion couplings @xmath24 .",
    "eq.([p=0 ] ) implies that @xmath35 is no longer a pole for a relativistic particle in the propagators ( [ rsc11 ] , [ rsn11 ] ) .",
    "we are not allowed to make wave - function renormalization ( [ rbound ] ) with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "eq.([p=0 ] ) indicates that the `` size '' of bound states ( [ bound ] ) increases as @xmath70 .",
    "these three - fermion - states may eventually dissolve into the virtual states of three individual fermions , whose possible configuration in momentum space is @xmath97@xcite , where @xmath72 is the total momentum and the relative momentum ( @xmath98 ) is zero .",
    "this dissolving phenomenon is entirely determined by both the dynamical and kinetic properties of the interacting theory .",
    "this is reminiscent of the papers@xcite discussing whether helium is an elementary or composite particle based on the vanishing of wave - function renormalizations of composite states .",
    "it is normally referred to as the composite condition that the wave - function renormalizations of bound states go to zero ( @xmath99)@xcite . so far , we only give an intuitive and qualitative discussion of the dissolving phenomenon on the basis of the relations between the residues ( generalized form factors ) @xmath79 , renormalized three - fermion - states and virtual states of three individual fermions ( three - fermion - cut ) .",
    "evidently , we are bound to do some dynamical calculations to show this phenomenon could happen .",
    "the form factor @xmath77 in eq.([zlzr ] ) for the left - handed three - fermion - state @xmath100 can be completely determined by the ward identity ( [ w ] ) .",
    "we appropriately take functional derivative of the ward identity ( [ w ] ) with respect to the `` primed '' field @xmath101 , and we obtain , @xmath102 which are positive and finite constants for @xmath44 ( see eq.([m ] ) ) . together with the propagators ( [ sn11 ] ) obtained by the strong coupling expansion for @xmath40 and @xmath46 , we conclude that the doublers of the neutral channel ( [ rsn11 ] ) are indeed relativistic massive particles , whose wave functions can be renormalized according to ( [ rbound ] ) .    given the strong coupling @xmath40 , in spite of the propagator ( [ rsn11 ] ) for the neutral three - fermion - state @xmath100 resulting from the strong coupling expansion for @xmath103 , we can make an analytical continuation from @xmath46 to @xmath35 .",
    "however , for the reason that @xmath104 as @xmath70 , we can not conclude that @xmath35 is a simple pole for a relativistic massless particle by an analytical continuation of the propagator ( [ rsn11 ] ) from @xmath46 to @xmath35 , whereas we are not allowed to perform a wave - function renormalization ( [ rbound ] ) for @xmath35 .",
    "actually , the propagator ( [ rsn11 ] ) is vanishing at @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to point out that at the limit of @xmath70 , the vanishing of the propagator ( [ rsn11 ] ) is definitely positive , i.e. , it is a double zero .",
    "this implies that ghost states with negative norm would not appear in low - energy spectrum .",
    "however , on the other hand , we can not conclude that the vanishing of the neutral propagator ( [ rsn11 ] ) for @xmath35 indicates the virtual state of three fermions in the neutral channel .",
    "since at @xmath105 the static limit is trivial , the computation of the propagator ( [ rsn11 ] ) by the strong coupling expansion may not be reliable .",
    "we must compute exactly the same two - point green function for the neutral three - fermion - operator , @xmath106 for @xmath40 and @xmath35 , as that ( [ rsn11 ] ) computed by the strong coupling expansion for @xmath107 and @xmath40 . since the coupling @xmath16 in segment @xmath29",
    "can be arranged such that @xmath108 we can adopt the effective weak coupling expansion in powers of @xmath109 to calculate the green function ( [ 3green ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath7 is always an external field in feyman diagrams ( see fig.3 ) of computing this green function ( [ 3green ] ) and each @xmath7 is associated with @xmath110 .",
    "this is a very reliable approximation as far as condition ( [ effweak ] ) holds . here",
    ", we want to emphasize that the meaning of @xmath35 is , @xmath111 we can determine the value of @xmath16 in such a way that the threshold scale @xmath31 is much larger than the soft symmetry breaking scale @xmath74 .    clearly , no bound states in eq.([3green ] ) can be formed for such a weak effective coupling . only the virtual state for the neutral three - fermion - cut ( [ cut ] )",

    "however , it is worthwhile to point out that such a mechanism violating the `` no - go '' theorem is only expected to work in the cases of neutral and anomaly - free theories .",
    "the form factor @xmath76 ( [ zlzr ] ) for the right - handed three - fermion - state @xmath146 ( [ bound ] ) can not be determined by the ward identity ( [ w ] ) .",
    "instead , it can be calculated by using the results obtained in the strong coupling expansion for @xmath40 and @xmath107 .    the 1pi - vertex function associated to @xmath76",
    "is given by the truncated green function ( [ zlzr ] ) that is defined as ( as indicated in fig.2 ) , @xmath147 where two - point green functions are given by , @xmath148 and their transformations into the momentum space in the last line of eq.([truncated ] ) , where @xmath149 is the free propagator of of the @xmath4 in the absence of multifermion couplings @xmath24 .    adopting the results @xmath150 ( [ sc11 ] ) , @xmath151",

    "together with the propagator ( [ rsc11 ] ) obtained by the strong coupling expansion for @xmath40 and @xmath46 , we conclude that the doublers of charged channel ( [ rsc11 ] ) are indeed relativistic massive particles , whose wave functions can be renormalized according to ( [ rbound ] ) .    in spite of eqs.([rsc11 ] ) and ( [ zr ] ) obtained by the strong coupling ( @xmath40 ) expansion for @xmath154 , we can analytically continue the momentum `` @xmath72 '' in these equations to the limit of @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath70 , @xmath155 , the propagator ( [ rsc11 ] ) of charged three - fermion - state vanishes .",
    "this implies that the low - energy state ( @xmath156 ) of @xmath86 with the `` wrong '' chirality is no longer a simple pole as a relativistic particle , instead , it is a virtual state , , the vanishing of the propagator of the charged three - fermion - state is definitely positive , i.e. , it is a double zero , which implies that ghost states with negative norm do not appear and couple to the gauge field in the low - energy limit .",
    "otherwise , the theory would be inconsistent @xcite . ] and the low - energy state of chiral fermions with `` right '' chirality should be realized in the spectrum of charged particles .",
    "we have to confess that unlike neutral channel case , without further more rigorous computations , numerical one for instance , we can not demonstrate such a scenario for realizing charged lattice chiral fermions to be definite ture , since the static limit is broken at @xmath105 .",
    "however , it is strongly emphasized that for the same reason that the static limit is broken at @xmath105 , we can not conclude the spectrum to be definitely vector - like as it was concluded in ref.@xcite .",
    "what we can conclude is a loophole at @xmath35 opening up .",
    "we go further in following to check in more details .    in order to directly show that the low - energy state ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath86 is the virtual state for a three - fermion - cut .",
    "we have to compute exactly the same two - point green function , @xmath157 of the charged channel for @xmath35 and @xmath40 as that ( [ rsc11 ] ) computed by the strong coupling expansion for @xmath46 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , unlike the case of neutral channel , we do not have the reliable method of the effective weak coupling expansion in powers of @xmath109 ( [ effweak ] ) , since @xmath61 is always an external field in the feyman diagrams computing the green function ( [ 3greenc ] ) and each @xmath158 does not associate with @xmath110 . in this case , the effective weak coupling expansion used for computing the neutral channel ( fig.3 ) must breakdown for @xmath40 .",

    "thus , at @xmath162 , we introduce @xmath163 , an addition number of fermion flavours of @xmath4 and @xmath7 so that , @xmath164 where the value of @xmath163 depends on the value of @xmath165 considered",
    ". therefore , in a certain intermediate region of @xmath162 , we adopt the large-@xmath163 technique to control the convergence of the approximation ( see fig.3 ) and calculate the green function ( [ 3greenc ] ) of the charged three - fermion - operators for the low - energy @xmath35 .",
    "hence we can get a qualitative insight into the charged low - energy spectrum ( @xmath166 ) within the intermediate region of @xmath16 ( [ largen ] ) .",
    "we expect that the dynamics of the interaction is not greatly changed by introducing more flavours . as for @xmath167 ,",
    "such large-@xmath163 technique is doomed to fail .",
    "analogous to the case of neutral channel ( [ w00 ] ) , the non - trivial leading order @xmath168 contribution , as indicated by the first diagram in fig.3 , is ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath169 the second order @xmath170 contribution , as indicated by the second diagram in fig.3 , is ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath171 where we ignore indices @xmath172 and @xmath173 is given as ( @xmath35 ) @xmath174 where the factor @xmath175 comes from interacting vertices .",

    "the reasons for such choices are that in the region ( [ largen ] ) , doublers ( @xmath182 ) are supposed to be decoupled via eq.([lp],[rp ] ) and the internal momentum @xmath116 runs from @xmath183 to @xmath182 . as for the propagator @xmath184 in eqs.([lpro],[z2p ] ) for the external total momentum @xmath35 , we adopt eq.([lp ] ) by analytical continuation from @xmath107 to @xmath35 .",
    "analogous to that ( [ w00 ] ) in the neutral channel , for the total momentum @xmath35 , the leading order contribution ( [ cut1c ] ) becomes '' indicates up to a finite constant .",

    "and the wave - function renormalization @xmath188 of the elementary fields @xmath177 at @xmath105 is given by , @xmath189 due to eq.([rr ] ) .",

    "the second - order contribution ( [ wc1 ] ) reads , @xmath191 thus , for @xmath35 the green function ( [ 3greenc ] ) is approximately computed as , @xmath192 which is regular at @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that in this intermediate region ( [ largen ] ) , the charged channel of three - fermion - operators at @xmath35 is not a simple pole for a massless relativistic particle with the `` wrong '' chirality , rather it is regular for a virtual state of three - fermion - cut .",
    "this agrees with the result obtained by analytical continuation of the propagator ( [ rsc11 ] ) from @xmath46 to @xmath35 .",
    "an important consistent check is to examine the equation ( [ wc1 ] ) for the `` doublers '' , i.e. , the external momentum @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath46 , @xmath193 this results in the coupling @xmath194 in the second - order contribution ( [ wc1 ] ) being enhanced up a factor of @xmath195 ( see eq.([wisf ] ) ) , @xmath196 analogously , for @xmath46 , @xmath197 the consequence is the complete breakdown of the large-@xmath163 expansion ( [ largen ] ) , which is not convergent for @xmath46 , to calculate the two - point green function ( [ 3greenc ] ) of charged three - fermion - operators .",
    "this implies that bound states ( three - fermion - states ) with the total momentum @xmath46 should be formed , consistently with the bound states that we find by the strong coupling expansion for @xmath107 .",
    "we turn to the computation of green function for the mixing between the elementary field @xmath4 and charged three - fermion - state @xmath198 ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "this mixing can be calculated by the large-@xmath163 expansion ( [ largen ] ) .",

    "consistently , an analytical continuation of the green function ( [ mixingc ] ) from @xmath46 to @xmath35 shows vanishing of the mixing at @xmath35 as well",
    ".    finally we check that in the intermediate region of @xmath16 ( [ largen ] ) , whether the green function ( [ lpro ] ) for the elementary field @xmath48 has a simple pole at @xmath35 representing a relativistic massless particle . due to @xmath201 ( [ z2 ] )",
    ", one can check the propagator ( [ lpro ] ) for @xmath48 has a simple pole at @xmath105 , which indicates a massless , charged left - handed @xmath48 in the low - energy spectrum .",
    "this agrees with the analytical continuation of the propagator ( [ lp ] ) from @xmath46 to @xmath35 .    in the continuation from eq.([rsc11 ] ) for @xmath107 to eq.([3cut ] ) for @xmath35 , we must meet the `` dissolving '' threshold @xmath31 , which should be the same as that in the neutral channel .",
    "we need to point out that the computation of charged channel is different from the computation of neutral channel . in the neutral channel ,",
    "the green functions ( [ rp],[mx],[rsn11 ] ) ) for @xmath46 and ( [ free],[3cut],[cut3 ] ) for @xmath35 are both consistently calculated in @xmath40 . however , in the charged channel , the green functions ( [ lpro],[3cut ] , [ cut3 ] ) for @xmath35 are computed in the intermediate region @xmath162 ( [ largen ] ) , while the same green functions ( [ lp],[rsc11],[mixingc ] ) for @xmath46 are computed in the region @xmath40 . this may raise a question whether the dynamics we explore for @xmath202 and for @xmath203 are consistent .",
    "we argue that such studies are qualitatively justified , since the computations in the strong coupling expansion with respect to doublers ( @xmath46 ) are valid as well for @xmath162 ( [ o(1 ) ] ) as discussed in the section ii .    in conclusion , on the basis of approximate calculations of relevant two - point green functions of elementary and composite three - fermion - operators with respect to doublers @xmath46 and low - energy mode @xmath35 , we qualitatively explore a possible scaling window in segment @xmath29 , where in the low - energy spectrum , the three - fermion - states with the `` wrong '' chirality turn into their corresponding virtual states , and elementary fermion states with the `` right '' chirality remain as massless states .",
    "evidently , full non - perturbative numerical simulation to explore this scaling window is very inviting and necessary in particular for any solid conclusions in the charged channel .",
    "multifermion coupling models , for instance the eichten - preskill model and the one presented in this paper , can formally be rewritten as scalar - fermion coupling models in the lattice ( cutoff ) scale by introducing appropriate scalar fields , which mimic the bound states of two fermions .",
    "there are many classes of multifermion coupling models and scalar - fermion couplings models , the multifermion coupling models and scalar- fermion coupling models belong to the same universal class and are certainly equivalent in the sense that not only they can be formally translated each other by introducing auxiliary scalar fields in path integrals , but also they share the same infrared fix ( scaling ) points and lines in the phase space and have the same low - energy spectra , couplings and relevant operators upon those fix points and lines . the later property is more important and difficult to generally prove the equivalence between a given multifermion model and a given scalar - fermion coupling model .",
    "what we can do for a given either multifermion coupling model or scalar - fermion coupling model is to analyze all possible infrared scaling regin in phase space .",
    "the smit - swift model certainly belongs to one universal class of scalar - fermion coupling models and equivalent multifermion coupling models .",
    "the eichten - preskill multifermion - coupling model and its equivalent scalar - fermion coupling model could belong to another universal class that is not proved to be the same as the universal class of models of the smit - swift type .",
    "it is no doubt that our multifermion- coupling model has its equivalent scalar - fermion coupling model .",
    "however , no one has demonstrated that our multifermion - coupling model must be in the same universal classes of either the smit - swift model or the eichten - preskill model .",
    "the only thing to do is to analyze all possible scaling region of our model by appropriate methods as that we present in this paper .",
    "we can clearly point out why and what could make possible differences between our model and the eichten - preskill as well as smit - swift models in the existence of a possible scaling region for lattice chiral fermions .    the common feature of our model , the eichten - preskill model and smit - swift model is the momentum - dependence of multifermion couplings or scalar - fermion couplings attempting to give doublers @xmath44 heavy masses and decouple them from the low - energy spectrum . in the phases of weak multifermion couplings or scalar - fermion couplings ,",
    "doublers are not decoupled and the spontaneous symmetry breaking could occur . therefore , in these three models we only need to discuss the phase of strong multifermion couplings or scalar - fermion couplings where three - fermion - states or bound states of scalar - fermion are formed , and spectrum is expected to be vector - like .",
    "question clearly is whether we can find a scaling region in the strong - coupling phase of these three models , and in this scaling region the low - energy mode of three - fermion - states or scalar - fermion bound states with the  wrong ",
    "chirality can be excluded , and the chiral fermions with the  right ",
    "chirality exsit in the low - energy spectrum .    in the strong - coupling phase ,",
    "the momentum - dependence of the strong multifermion coupling of our model is elaborately made in such a way that in a segment of the strong coupling phase ( @xmath204 ) for all doublers @xmath44 the strong - coupling limit ( static limit ) exists and for the low - energy mode @xmath35 the strong - coupling limit does not exist as discussed in section iii , beside no hard spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs as discussed in eqs.([ws2],[ws2 ] ) and ref.@xcite .",
    "these crucial features are very different from the momentum - dependence of the eichten - preskill and smit - swift models in their strong - coupling phases , where no such segment have been found . as the consequences of these features , our model has the following properties differentiated from the eichten - preskill and smit - swift models .    in the strong coupling phase ( pms ) of the smit - swift model , only neutral sector of vector - like fermion exits in the spectrum which is computed by the strong - coupling expansion@xcite method analogous to the one adopted in this paper .",
    "the wave - function renormalization of the composite neutral field is given by the vacuum expectation value of scalar fields @xmath205 , @xmath206@xcite , which does not vanish as @xmath70 , showing the neutral scalar - fermion bound state can not be excluded from the low - energy spectrum . however , as clearly demonstrated in section v , the neutral three - fermion - state , which dissolves into the three - fermion - cut , is excluded from the low - energy spectrum for its wave - function renormalization goes to zero as @xmath35 and effective multifermion coupling @xmath207 vanishes without any hard spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "although the scalar - fermion coupling in the smit - swift model can be reduced so that the scalar - fermion bound state could disappear , the model runs into the phase of hard spontaneous symmetry breaking ( @xmath208 ) .    in the strong coupling phase of the eichten - preskill model , not only neutral sector but",
    "also charged sector of vector - like fermions exits in the spectra , both are computed by the strong - coupling expansion@xcite method that is the exactly same as adopted in this paper",
    ". however , the strong coupling limit ( the static limit ) of the eichten - preskill model is regular at @xmath35 differentiated from the singularity of the static limit at @xmath35 of our model .",
    "this implies that the multifermion couplings as function of the momentum @xmath72 of the eichten - preskill model are not appropriate so as to find a scaling region , these massive charged fermions remain as vector - like not only for @xmath46 modes and but also for the low - energy mode ( @xmath35 ) . beside ,",
    "the multifermion couplings as function of the momentum @xmath72 of the eichten - preskill model develop a hard spontaneous symmetry breaking in an expected scaling region@xcite .",
    "the multifermion couplings as function of the momentum @xmath72 of our model are carefully made to avoid the hard spontaneous symmetry breaking in the possible scaling region @xmath29 , the shift - symmetry ( [ shift ] ) plays extremely important role in this matter . the eichten - preskill model for @xmath209 and @xmath210 would have a chance to work , if its multifermion couplings are more carefully defined .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the features of the spectrum of neutral and charged sectors appearing in segment @xmath29 ( [ segment ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to point out that in this scenario , doublers ( @xmath46 ) are decoupled by a gauge - invariant mass term , while the low - energy modes with the `` wrong '' chirality are `` decoupled '' by the vanishing of their generalized form factor .",
    "however , it is still far from a definitive demonstration that chiral gauge theories in the low - energy limit can be achieved in this way , we need to have numerical simulations to show that this scenario is indeed realized in segment @xmath29 .",
    "the whole spectrum in segment @xmath29 is gauge symmetric , and ward identities of gauge symmetry are preserved .",
    "we can straightforwardly turn on the perturbative gauge interaction . by the strong coupling expansion in powers of @xmath56 , we compute@xcite three - point vertex function @xmath211 and obtain the vertex of the @xmath6 gauge field coupling to the charged three - fermion - state ( the leading order of gauge coupling @xmath212 ) , @xmath213 where the momenta of three - fermion - states @xmath214 . according the renormalization ( [ ren ] ) of truncated green functions with two three - fermion - operator insertions , the vertex of gauge coupling to the three - fermion - states",

    "although eq.([rgauge ] ) is obtained for @xmath214 and @xmath218 , it can be analytically continued to @xmath219 .",
    "we find that in the limit of @xmath70 and @xmath220 , the coupling vertex ( [ rgauge ] ) of three - fermion - operators and gauge boson vanishes as @xmath221 .",
    "this consistently corresponds to the dissolving of three - fermion - states into three - fermion - cuts in the low - energy limit .",
    "since the propagator of charged three - fermion - states _ positively _ vanishes , there are no ghost states with negative norm coupling to gauge field through the ward identity stemming from the gauge symmetry in segment @xmath29 .",
    "the model presented in this paper can not be considered as a realistic model reflecting all aspects of chiral gauge theories .",
    "we need to completely understand the relationship between the anomaly - free condition and the realization of such dynamics discussed in the paper .",
    "we also need to understand what kind role of t hooft condition for anomaly matching@xcite , fermion - number violation and witten s @xmath0 global anomaly@xcite would play in such dynamics .    in this approach ,",
    "the left - handed field @xmath61 is the doublet of the @xmath6 chiral gauge group .",
    "however , it can be generalized to be the left - handed field ( complex representations ) of any anomaly - free chiral gauge group ( e.g.  @xmath209 and @xmath210 ) . a right - handed field ( spectator ) @xmath7 , that is a singlet of the chiral gauge group , can be introduced and coupled to the left - handed field in the same way as the multifermion couplings given in ( [ action ] ) . as for the right - handed field @xmath222 of chiral gauge groups , we can analogously introduce a left - handed spectator field @xmath223 that is a singlet of the chiral gauge groups , and couple it to the right - handed field @xmath222 in the same way as the multifermion couplings in the action ( [ action ] ) with @xmath224 .",
    "this indicates that such a formulation of chiral gauge theories is actually quite general .    to be more specific , we take the anomaly - free chiral gauge group of the standard model as an example . in this realistic case",
    ", @xmath177 can be both left - handed lepton doublets and left - handed quark doublets .",
    "the candidate for a right - handed spectator field @xmath7 could be the right - handed neutrino @xmath225 .",

    "these spectator fields @xmath225 and @xmath223 are free and decouple from other particles due to the @xmath225- and @xmath223-shift - symmetry acting on them . in this way , we can in principle have a gauge - invariant formulation of the standard model on the lattice . in practice ,",
    "non - perturbative analysis , which can be done analytically to show whether such a formulation gives the low - energy standard model , should be more or less similar to ( certainly more complicated than ) that discussed in this paper and references@xcite",
    ". however , the spectator field @xmath223 might not be necessary .",
    "alternatively , the t hooft vertex in the lattice formulation of the standard model@xcite provides a scenario in which fermion - number conservation is explicitly violated , and all chiral fermions find their patterns with opposite chirality within the standard model .",
