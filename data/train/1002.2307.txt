    "a great variety of problems both in material and basic science rely on the fundamental understanding of the intramolecular dynamics and kinetics of fragmentation ( bond rupture ) of linear macromolecular subject to a tensile force .",
    "typical examples comprise material failure under stress @xcite , polymer rupture @xcite , adhesion @xcite , friction @xcite , mechanochemistry @xcite , and biological applications of dynamical force microscopy @xcite . in particular , the problem of polymer rupture as a kinetic process has a longstanding history and dates back to the publications of bueche @xcite and zhurkov _ et al .",

    "the breaking of intramolecular bonds is treated as a thermally activated process and is described by arrhenius s formula for the rate of bond scission .    in recent years investigations",
    "have been complemented by ample application of computer experiments .",
    "comprehensive molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations of @xmath0 chain fragmentation ( at constant strain ) have been carried out , whereby harmonic @xcite , morse @xcite , or lennard - jones @xcite chain models have been used .",
    "one of the principal questions to be answered is : `` how long will it take for this system to break ? '' .",
    "a theoretical interpretation of md - results @xcite , based on an effectively one - particle model , has been suggested in terms of kramers rate theory @xcite .",
    "thus , the activation energy of the one - particle model @xmath2 has been found to be close to the barrier height observed in the simulations , whereas the measured frequency of bond scission appears more than two orders of magnitudes smaller then the corresponding frequency , predicted by kramers theory .",
    "the authors interpret this controversial result as a manifestation of the existence of collective modes which are missing in the one - particle kramers theory .",
    "it has also been noticed that a truly irreversible break may occur , if bonds are stretched to lengths , considerably larger than the one corresponding to the barrier position .",
    "this indicates the possibility for bond recombination whereby the chain integrity is restored with some finite probability .",
    "the problem of polymer fragmentation has also been studied theoretically @xcite for the case of constant stress when a tethered chain of segments is subjected to a pulling force at the free chain end .",
    "the consideration has been based on a multidimensional version of the transition state theory ( tst ) .",
    "friction is then taken into account by coupling the polymer to a set of harmonic oscillators , simulating thus the presence of a thermostat .",
    "a comparison of the calculated breaking rate with the corresponding md observation @xcite shows again that the theoretical rate is about 250 times larger . also",
    "the role of the bond healing process has been discussed which helps to improve to some extent the agreement between theory and simulation . nevertheless , despite the multidimensional nature of tst",
    ", it does not take into account properly the collective unstable mode development , which leads , in our opinion , to the essential overestimation of the breaking rate .",
    "the collectivity effect has been recently treated @xcite for constant strain and periodic boundary conditions ( a ring polymer ) on the basis of the multidimensional kramers approach @xcite . within this approach",
    "the development of a collective unstable mode and the effect of dissipation can be described consistently .",
    "it has been shown that in this case the effective break frequency is of the same order of magnitude as the one observed in the simulation .    in the present work",
    "we develop this approach further for the case of a tethered morse chain , consisting of @xmath3 segments and subjected to a constant tensile force @xmath4 applied at its free end .",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the scission rate of the bonds , its distribution along the polymer chain , and its variation with changing temperature and dissipation . for comparison with computer experiment",
    ", we also perform extensive md simulations in both one- @xmath0 , and three dimensions , @xmath1 , and witness significant differences in the fragmentation behavior of the chain , despite the observed good agreement between theoretical predictions and simulation data .",
    "a major objective of the current study is the elucidation of the problem of bond recombination ( self - healing ) which has found little attention in literature so far . to this end",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the life times and extension distances of healing bonds and compare them to our md results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ kramers_langer ]",
    "we give a sketch of the multidimensional kramers - langer escape theory @xcite .",
    "we also outline the problem of multiple points of exit from potential well @xcite which is necessary for treating bond rupture with respect to the consecutive number of each bond along the chain . in section [ model_description ]",
    "we present our model of one - dimensional morse string of beads and consider the eigenvalue problem in the vicinity of the metastable minimum of the effective potential and at the barrier ( saddle point ) which is needed for the description of the unstable collective mode .",
    "section [ md_results ] gives briefly details of our md simulation and presents the main numeric results as well as their interpretation in the light of our theoretical approach . in section [ self_healing ]",
    "the healing process is discussed in terms of distributions of healing times and bond extensions .",

    "the overall return process can be seen as the composition ( recall that the process is markovian ) of two processes .",
    "the first one starts from the top of the inverted harmonic potential with the initial @xmath387 and @xmath388 and continues down the ramp until a turning point @xmath402 where the velocity becomes zero , i.e. , @xmath403 , at an intermediate time moment @xmath142 .",

    "frequently such a pseudo - broken bond heals again so that from the above record , one may recover the distribution of the maximum expansion beyond the barrier , and the time spent in a pseudo - broken state before the healing occurs .    in fig .",
    "[ heal ] we show the distribution of the healing lengths and healing times ( inset ) obtained from simulations and from theory .",
    "evidently , the healing time distribution @xmath418 looks qualitatively identical for both the theoretical treatment ( which is based on eq .",
    "( [ healing_pdf]))and the simulations : there is a maximum just beyond the barrier crossing event for @xmath419 and a fast ( exponential ) decay thereafter .",
    "the existence of the maximum can be attributed to the thermostat - just after crossing the barrier one has to wait for a while a thermal kick turns the trajectory into reverse direction . on the other hand , for longer time intervals the downhill motion wins ( i.e. , the healing becomes progressively improbable ) and @xmath418 decreases rapidly with time .",
    "the distribution of the healable expansions beyond the barrier is of greater importance because it sets a more stringent criterion of true ( irreversible ) rupture .",
    "we see that for @xmath342 , the probability of healing is negligible for an expansion of @xmath420 beyond the barrier , i.e. , a bond expansion of @xmath421 .",
    "once the expansion of the bond reaches @xmath422 for @xmath342 , it is highly unlikely for the bond to heal .",
    "one should note that the process is stochastic in nature so that a bond that has expanded even beyond @xmath399 may still manage to heal .",
    "such an event , however , is highly unlikely and the criterion defined in the above manner serves to be a good one for all practical purposes .",
    "the theoretical distribution ( calculated according to eqs .",
    "( [ q ] ) , ( [ i ] ) and ( [ j ] ) ) , decays much faster than that obtained from simulations ; this is because of the faster descent of the quadratic potential ( considered in theory within the linearized approximation ) as compared to the roughly linearly decaying effective potential beyond the barrier .    how does the above picture change when the conditions of the simulation are varied ? to answer this question ,",
    "we have performed simulations and we find that the above distribution does not vary much with friction , chain length or whether the simulation is performed in @xmath337d or @xmath365d .",
    "the distribution however depends on the applied tensile force as shown in fig .",
    "[ force ] for two different forces .",
    "as expected intuitively , the distribution decays faster for a larger force because healing is more unlikely in case of a steeper unstable potential beyond the barrier . from a practical point of view",
    ", such a distribution for several different forces can be very helpful in determining a criterion for irreversible rupture .",
    "we next turn to the question of the dependence of the healing on temperature .     and @xmath343 at different values of the temperature .",
    "a power - law regression gives an exponent of @xmath423 in @xmath337d and @xmath424 in @xmath365d .",

    "as expected , healing becomes more frequent as the temperature is increased because the bead that has crossed the barrier now receives stronger thermal kicks capable of sending it back over the barrier .",
    "one can also see that for the same temperature , healing is ( understandably ) more frequent in @xmath0 than in @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of growing friction @xmath425 is similar , on the one hand it strengthens kicks by the thermostat on the beads at the verge of breaking , and on the other hand it delays such beads in `` rolling down '' the downhill ramp potential , providing more time to receive a thermal kick which could turn them back .",
    "in the present work we have studied the process of polymer chain breakage for linear chains subjected to constant tensile force by multidimensional kramers - langer approach and compared theoretical predictions to results of extensive md simulations in one- and three dimensions .",
    "the adopted theoretical treatment makes it possible to consider collective unstable modes as being mainly responsible for chain scission .",
    "comparison with simulation data as , for example , the distribution of the probability for scission over bond index , the scission time distribution , variation of mfpt with temperature and chain length as well as the bond breaking dynamics indicates that the kramers - langer approach agrees qualitatively with observations .",
    "we demonstrate that the recombination ( self - healing ) dynamics of the breaking bonds can be qualitatively reproduced by the kramers equation .",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the healing time and expansion distributions in reasonable agreement with the md data and reveal the variation of the fraction of healing bonds with temperature and friction .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate that more that @xmath426 of the crossings of the activation barrier end up as healed bonds again ( this fraction changes with temperature ) especially in the @xmath1 simulations .",
    "this finding should be kept in mind in the assessment of earlier research work where only @xmath0 simulations of breaking chains have been performed and bond - healing was not allowed for .",
    "one should emphasize , however , that we still find a discrepancy of nearly an order of magnitude between theory and computer experiment regarding the mean rate of scission , that is , the rate of bond breaking is significantly underestimated by theory ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the origin of this discrepancy is related to the existence of non - linear localized excitations ( breathers ) in the anharmonic lattice which remain out of the scope of this investigation .",
    "recent studies @xcite indicate the breathers play very important role regarding energy transfer in discrete non - linear chains which serve a generic model for biopolymers .",
