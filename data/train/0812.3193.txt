    "ultracold dipolar gases display a variety of unique properties that are absent in those dominated by s - wave scattering @xcite .",
    "the successful bose - einstein condensation of @xmath0cr atoms with a large magnetic dipole moment @xcite and the first experimental realization of ultracold krb polar molecular gas @xcite are attracting even more experimental and theoretical interests in ultracold dipolar bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "other than possible applications in fields such as quantum information @xcite , one main motivation along studies of ultracold dipolar gases is to explore new physics afforded by the anisotropic and long - range dipole - dipole interaction . for a recent review ,",
    "see ref .",
    "indeed , by varying the shape of a dipolar bec , the dipole polarization axis , and the trapping geometry @xcite , the partially attractive and partially repulsive dipole - dipole interaction of a dipolar bec can be easily manipulated to a great extent .",
    "even more dramatically , by using the well - established feshbach resonance technique @xcite , it is now possible to significantly reduce or completely shut off the effects of short - range interactions and hence realize purely dipolar gases , where the physics is completely dominated by the dipolar interaction .",
    "for example , superfluid transitions in purely dipolar fermi gases baranovpra2002,baranovprl2004 , fractional quantum hall states in purely dipolar gas trapped in a rotating optical lattice @xcite , and collapse features of a purely dipolar bec @xcite have been studied .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the properties of a dipolar bec confined in a double - well potential .",
    "we focus on the structure of the ground state wave function and the dynamical quantum self - trapping ( qst ) phenomenon which is among the most dramatic and counter - intuitive effects induced by the self - interaction of a bec .",
    "the qst phenomenon has been extensively studied in non - dipolar bec s @xcite and is closely connected with other physical contexts including the josephson effect in superconductors @xcite and the superfluidity of @xmath1he @xcite . in particular , the qst of a non - dipolar bec in a double - well potential , which is sometimes called a bose - josephson junction , is now well understood trappingprl , raghavanpra1999,ostrovskayapra2000,gongpra2008 and has been observed experimentally @xcite . from a time - independent point of view , on the mean - field level the self - interaction of a bec can induce the emergence of stationary states with a large population imbalance between two wells . from a time - dependent point of view , the josephson oscillation between the two wells can be suppressed by the self - interaction of a bec , which can be regarded as a quantum zeno effect because each atom in the bec is being measured \" by all the other atoms .",
    "our interest here is how the anisotropic nature of the dipolar interaction can be exploited to manipulate the dipolar bec in a double - well potential , as manifested in the static properties of ground state structure and in the dynamical evolution of the system prepared out of equilibrium .",
    "we approach this problem by three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "we find a wide region where the dynamics of a dipolar bec can show either josephson tunneling or qst without displaying signs of collapse .",
    "more significantly , we shall demonstrate that the dipole orientation can radically affect the transition from qst to josephson oscillation .",
    "furthermore , to gain more insights into the dynamical qst , we construct an effective two - mode model which has been widely applied in non - dipolar systems .",
    "we find that this simple two - mode model successfully explains the numerically observed transition threshold between josephson oscillation and qst , but fails to account for the oscillation frequency in the josephson oscillation regime .",
    "we provide a thorough analysis of the success and the failure of the two - mode model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , after introducing a three - dimensional realistic model of a purely dipolar bec trapped in a double - well potential , we study the structure of the ground state wave function . in sec .",
    "iii , we present detailed simulation results regarding how the dipole orientation affects the self - trapping of the system . in sec .",
    "iv , we attempt to use a simple effective two - mode model to explain the dependence of the onset of self - trapping of a dipolar bec upon the dipole orientation . in sec . v we discuss why our effective two - mode model can not be used to estimate the oscillation frequency in the josephson oscillation regime .",
    "section vi concludes and summarizes this work .",
    "appendix a presents some details regarding our numerical calculations of the dipole - dipole interaction potential .",
    "to be specific , let us consider a dipolar bec of @xmath0cr , which has large magnetic moment @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the bohr magneton ) .",
    "we assume below the s - wave scattering length is tuned to zero via feshbach resonance , thus resulting in a purely dipolar atomic bec .",
    "we further assume that the system is confined in a trapping potential with a cylindrical symmetry in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane and a double - well structure along the @xmath6 direction . that is , we consider a confining potential @xmath7where @xmath8 is the atomic mass , @xmath9 is the confining harmonic frequency in the transverse direction , @xmath10 is the confining harmonic frequency in the longitudinal direction , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the height and the width of a gaussian profile modeling a barrier between the two potential wells along the @xmath6 direction . without loss of generality , we assume that the dipole moments are polarized by the external magnetic field and are confined in the @xmath4-@xmath6 plane .",
    "the two - body dipolar interaction potential is then given by @xmath13 /r^{5 } ,   \\label{ddi}\\]]where @xmath14 is the angle between the polarized dipole orientation and the @xmath6 axis , @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the magnetic permeability of the vacuum . for convenience",
    "we define a dimensionless dipolar interaction parameter , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the axial harmonic oscillator length and @xmath19 is the total number of atoms .",
    "we can then adopt a unit system where the units for length , time , and energy are given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . unless specified otherwise , for the numerical results presented below we set @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( which corresponds to about 2000 cr atoms for the axial trapping frequency @xmath27 hz ) .",
    "in such a confining potential , the mean - field dynamics of a purely dipolar bec at @xmath28 is described by the following dimensionless time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation : @xmath29where the macroscopic wave function @xmath30 is normalized to unity .",

    "( [ itm(a ) ] ) and ( [ itm(b ) ] ) indicate that if we take into account the nonzero overlap @xmath128 , the effective coupling between the two modes will be quite different . indeed ,",
    "if we assume that in the josephson oscillation regime the nonlinear terms @xmath123 and @xmath129 have a rather small impact on the oscillation rate , we have the following corrected inter - mode coupling strength @xmath130so long as @xmath131 is nonzero , this corrected coupling strength @xmath132 can differ significantly from @xmath86 .",

    "for example , @xmath123 contributes a term @xmath138 to the inter - mode coupling strength .",
    "this contribution will partially cancel the @xmath139 term in @xmath140 defined above .",
    "all these observations make it clear that the zero - overlap approximation is the main reason why our effective two - mode picture can not be used to predict the rate of josephson oscillations .",
    "consistent with our simulation result that the josephson oscillation rate depends strongly on the trapping geometry , we also find that if we slightly change the width of the fitting mode wavefunctions @xmath141 and hence the value of @xmath128 , then the value of @xmath142 may also change significantly .",
    "this implies that if we take eqs .",
    "( [ itm(a ) ] ) and ( [ itm(b ) ] ) as an improved two - mode theory , then it is possible to refit the mode wavefunctions and obtain the right josephson oscillation rate .",
    "this approach is however not appealing to us , because by working with eqs .",
    "( itm(a ) ) and ( [ itm(b ) ] ) we lose the simplicity of a two - mode picture .",
    "so why our two - mode picture with the zero - overlap approximation can still give the correct transition point between the qst regime and the josephson oscillation regime ?",
    "the main reason lies in that our two - mode treatment already self - consistently used much information from the simulation results .",
    "in particular , in the qst regime , @xmath143 defined in eq .",
    "( 15 ) is dominated by @xmath144 and hence scales with @xmath145 , the same scaling behavior as @xmath146 . as such , the actual magnitude of @xmath120 will not affect the ratio of @xmath147 , the key index for a two - mode theory . in the josephson oscillation regime ,",
    "@xmath148 because @xmath149 , and @xmath150 because of the large magnitude of @xmath120 .",
    "this is also consistent with the condition for the josephson oscillation regime in the two - mode theory .",
    "to conclude , using three - dimensional numerical simulations , we have investigated the structures of the ground state and the quantum self - trapping phenomenon of a purely dipolar bose - einstein condensate trapped in a double - well potential .",
    "the anisotropic nature of the dipole - dipole interaction is seen to impact dramatically on the transition between two dynamical regimes , namely , the josephson oscillation regime and the quantum self - trapping regime .",
    "this finding is the key result of this work .    to gain useful insights we constructed a simple effective two - mode model to understand the transition from the self - trapping regime to the josephson oscillation regime .",
    "interestingly , though our two - mode picture is based on a rough zero - overlap approximation , the transition point obtained from our two - mode picture is in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations .",
    "somewhat expected , when it comes to the rate of the josephson oscillations , our effective two - mode picture is no longer valid .",
    "we traced its failure to the zero - overlap approximation and discussed how we might be able to improve our effective two - mode treatment and find a better agreement with simulation results by lifting the zero - overlap approximation .",
    "however , by lifting the zero - overlap approximation , the simplicity of a two - mode picture in understanding the quantum self - trapping is lost .",
    "there are now keen interests in the dynamics of bec s in optical lattices .",
    "in particular , the quantum self - trapping effect is known to play an important role in determining whether or not a condensate can spread out in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic nature of the quantum self - trapping of a dipolar bec suggests that tuning the dipole orientation can lead to the control of the self - trapping effect in optical lattices and hence the control of transport properties of dipolar bec s in periodic potentials .",
    "we hope our work here may stimulate experimental efforts along this line .",
