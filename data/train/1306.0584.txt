    "it is by now well established that when two parallel two - dimensional electron systems are brought close together in the presence of a large magnetic field , electron - electron interactions both within and between layers can conspire to drive a transition into a remarkable new phase of quantum electronic matter . in this",
    "new phase electrons lose their memory of which layer they are in , and instead inhabit both layers equally .",
    "it is most remarkable that this  which - layer uncertainty \" does not hinge on the presence of a finite interlayer tunneling amplitude but instead develops spontaneously as the system reaches for the correlated state with the lowest coulomb interaction energy .",
    "to date , this new phase has been experimentally observed only when the total electron density in the bilayer , @xmath0 , matches the degeneracy @xmath1 of the lowest single spin - resolved landau level created by the magnetic field , @xmath2 .",
    "this situation therefore corresponds to total landau level filling factor @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , it is only the @xmath4 electron density which must match the level degeneracy ; the apportionment of @xmath5 between the two layers is not important ( to a first approximation ) .",
    "similar phases are expected to exist at @xmath6 , 1/3 , and elsewhere , but these have so far eluded detection .",
    "there are multiple equivalent languages in which the physics of the new phase can be described .",
    "notable among these are the pseudospin ferromagnetism language and the exciton condensation language . in the pseudospin ferromagnetism picture ,",
    "electrons definitely in one layer are declared pseudospin  up \" , while those definitely in the other layer are pseudospin  down \" . in the condensed phase of a balanced bilayer ( @xmath7 ) at small layer separation , exchange interactions favor a state in which the pseudospins of all electrons are parallel and",
    "lie in the @xmath8 plane of pseudospin space ( the electrons thus occupying both layers simultaneously ) .",
    "the system resembles a metallic easy - plane ferromagnet .",
    "alternatively , in the exciton condensation language one takes advantage of the finite number of states within a landau level to focus on the empty states rather than the filled ones . the condensed phase",
    "may then be viewed as electrons in the lowest landau level of one layer bound to holes in the lowest landau level of the other layer .",
    "as long as @xmath3 , the number of holes in the one layer always matches the number of electrons in the other . in close analogy to the cooper pairs in a standard bcs superconductor , the number of these electron - hole pairs , or excitons , is not a good quantum number .",
    "it is the attractive interlayer interaction between the electrons and holes that allows the bilayer system to condense into an especially low energy state , one not available to the individual layers themselves .",
    "the pseudospin ferromagnetism and exciton condensation pictures are completely equivalent and can be used interchangeably . for the purposes of the present article",
    "however , we will predominantly employ the exciton picture .",
    "the reason for this is simple , if largely aesthetic : the most direct experimental demonstrations of the unusual physics of the @xmath3  condensed phase involve driving electrical currents in opposite directions through the two two - dimensional electron gas layers .",
    "such counterflowing currents are readily envisioned as uniform flows of charge neutral excitons .",
    "signature experimental results , such as the vanishing of the hall resistance in counterflow , are rendered intuitive in the exciton language .",
    "the condensed @xmath3  bilayer system at small layer separation exhibits an energy gap to its charged excitations and displays the quantized hall effect ( qhe ) .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the situation at larger layer separation where ( in the balanced case ) no energy gap nor hall plateau is observed .",
    "remarkably , this transport phenomenon , which is observed when parallel currents flow in the two layers , is among the @xmath9 interesting aspects of the excitonic phase .",
    "the most interesting , and so far unique , aspects of the condensed @xmath3  phase stem from the presence of a condensate degree of freedom .",
    "in essence , the contrast between an ordinary quantum hall system and the present @xmath3  bilayer system is analogous to the distinction between a semiconductor and a superconductor . both the semiconductor and the superconductor display an energy gap and current - carrying excited states , but only the superconductor possesses a cooper pair condensate capable of transporting current without dissipation .",
    "similarly , both ordinary qhe states and the present bilayer @xmath3  state display a gap to charged excitations , but only the @xmath3  system possesses an exciton condensate capable of ( neutral ) superfluid transport .",
    "indeed , it is the presence of the condensate that has motivated almost two decades of theoretical and experimental study of the bilayer @xmath3  system .",
    "it is also the main focus of the present article .",
    "the scope of this paper is limited to experimental investigations of the @xmath3  bilayer exciton condensate by means of electrical transport . as such ,",
    "no attempt to review the many very interesting experimental studies of the transition into the excitonic phase from the weakly - coupled state at large layer separation has been made , nor have the numerous important results of alternative experimental probes ( e.g. optical , thermoelectric , etc . ) been included .",
    "a comprehensive review of the large associated theoretical literature on the @xmath3  problem has wisely been left for an expert .",
    "the existence of a quantized hall plateau and an associated vanishing longitudinal resistivity at @xmath3  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for early examples @xcite ) demonstrates that closely - spaced bilayer 2d electron systems at this filling factor possess an energy gap to charged excitations . in this",
    "the system is no different than any other quantized hall system .",
    "however , the existence of a condensate capable of coherent transport wholly independent of the charged excitations is not revealed by the data shown in fig .",
    "the condensate degree of freedom is hidden from conventional electrical measurements based upon parallel current flow in the two layers .",
    "to couple to the condensate , experiments involving anti - parallel , or counterflowing , currents must be performed .",
    "two such experiments are discussed here in thumbnail form .",
    "experiments such as these require separate electrical connections to the two layers in the bilayer sample .",
    "fortunately , a robust technique for establishing such contacts was developed in 1990 @xcite .",
    "figure [ thumbs]a shows two interlayer tunneling conductance traces obtained from a single balanced bilayer 2des sample .",
    "each trace was recorded at @xmath3 , albeit at different total densities @xmath11 and magnetic fields .",
    "( adjusting the density is enabled by electrostatic gates deposited on the sample s top and backside surfaces . ) for the red and blue traces shown the effective interlayer separation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the center - to - center distance between the two gaas quantum wells ( here @xmath14 nm ) , and @xmath15 is the magnetic length , is @xmath12@xmath16 and 2.3 , respectively .",
    "for the high density , @xmath12@xmath17 data , the tunneling conductance near zero interlayer voltage is very small .",
    "indeed , the zero bias tunneling conductance is heavily suppressed by the strong coulomb correlations characteristic of landau quantized _ single layer _ 2d electron systems .",
    "this suppression reflects a coulomb pseudogap in the tunneling density of states which denies rapidly injected tunneling electrons access to any low energy , highly correlated states the 2des may possess . in contrast , the red trace in fig . [ thumbs ]",
    "shows a strong , highly resonant peak in the tunneling conductance at zero bias .",
    "this peak , which appears to be confined to the same range of parameters ( @xmath12 , temperature , magnetic field , etc . ) as the @xmath3  qhe , is fundamentally rooted in the `` which layer '' uncertainty characteristic of the excitonic phase .",
    "the strong interlayer correlations built into the phase ensure that there is no energy cost associated with the transfer of an electron from one layer to the other . crudely speaking ,",
    "an electron about to tunnel from one layer is assured of the existence of a hole immediately opposite it in the other layer .",
    "the tunneling conductance peak may be viewed as an indirect signature of counterflow , or excitonic , superfluidity .",
    "an electron tunneling between layers momentarily creates a localized charge build - up in one layer and a corresponding deficit in the other . for widely separated layers these twin defects relax independently and only very slowly owing to the small conductivity @xmath18 of 2d electrons in large magnetic fields .",
    "however , once the excitonic phase is established at smaller layer separation , the very high counterflow conductivity of its condensate is the perfect vehicle for rapidly relaxing this antisymmetric bilayer charge defect .",
    "the sharply resonant peak in the tunneling conductance at @xmath3  signals a nearly discontinuous jump in the tunneling current at zero interlayer voltage .",
    "this is obviously reminiscent of the dc josephson effect in superconducting tunnel junctions .",
    "how close this connection really is remains a subject of intense experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "figure [ thumbs]b shows another dramatic consequence of exciton condensation at @xmath3 . the hall resistance measured in one of the two 2d layers",
    "is plotted vs. inverse total filling factor @xmath19 . as in fig .",
    "[ thumbs]a , the two curves derive from different total electron densities @xmath11 and therefore different effective layer separations @xmath12  at @xmath3 . unlike an ordinary hall effect measurement in which equal , co - directed currents flow in the two layers , in this case the individual layer currents are equal in magnitude , but opposite in direction .",
    "this is , therefore , a counterflow ( cf ) experiment . as the magnetic field ( and hence @xmath19 )",
    "is increased from zero , a series of hall plateaus is observed .",
    "these plateaus correspond to the familiar quantized hall states present in each layer separately .",
    "the fact that the current is being returned via the opposite layer is of no consequence .",
    "however , around @xmath3  the cf hall resistance behaves very differently in the two curves . for the high density data ( blue ) , where @xmath20 at @xmath3 , the hall resistance remains close to the classical hall line .",
    "in contrast , for the low density data , where @xmath21 at @xmath3 , the cf hall resistance drops essentially to zero at @xmath3 .",
    "( importantly , the hall voltage measured in the other layer also falls close to zero around @xmath3 . ) as with the tunneling anomaly discussed above , this vanishing of the hall resistance in counterflow only occurs when the @xmath3  excitonic qhe state is present .",
    "a facile explanation of this remarkable result is evident : counterflowing currents in the two layers can be transported by the condensate which consists entirely of charge neutral excitons .",
    "being neutral the excitons experience no lorentz force and thus the counterflow hall voltage vanishes .",
    "as will become clear in subsequent sections , this simple explanation is convincingly supported by the most recent experiments .",
    "in a seminal 1983 paper , halperin @xcite extended the argument given by laughlin @xcite for the fractional quantized hall effect ( fqhe ) to two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) possessing a discrete internal quantum number .",
    "while the most obvious such quantum number is the electron spin ( and halperin s wavefunctions do accurately approximate certain spin unpolarized fqhe states ) , layer index in bilayer 2des systems is another possibility .",
    "subsequent work by haldane and rezayi and by pietilainen and chakraborty made the case for new , intrinsically bilayer , fqhe states at @xmath22 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .    on the experimental side , the fabrication of closely - spaced double layer 2d electron systems of high quality presented challenges beyond those already overcome in the growth of high mobility single layer systems .",
    "nevertheless , by around 1990 gaas - based bilayer 2dess with mobilities around @xmath23 @xmath24/vs had been obtained .",
    "two main architectures were pursued : wide single quantum wells in which electrostatic effects produce a ground subband wavefunction with a pronounced dumbbell shape , and true double quantum wells consisting of two thin gaas layers embedded in the alloy al@xmath25ga@xmath26as .",
    "since it is generally desirable to keep single particle tunneling small in comparison with interlayer coulomb interactions , the latter geometry has dominated experiments on the @xmath3  state , both in electron - electron and hole - hole bilayers .",
    "the need for weak tunneling and small layer separation obviously conflict .",
    "the result has been structures in which the alloy barrier layer separating the two quantum wells has a high aluminum concentration , al@xmath27ga@xmath28as being typical , in order to increase the tunnel barrier height .",
    "unfortunately , the high reactivity of aluminum , which concentrates residual impurities in the barrier layer , contributes to the relatively low mobilities of contemporary double layer 2d electron systems used for @xmath3  research .",
    "the first experimental evidence for unusual quantized hall states in bilayer electron systems was obtained in 1992 @xcite .",
    "much of the original excitement was focused on the presence of a hall plateau at @xmath29 .",
    "this plateau occurs at total landau level filling @xmath30 , which corresponds to individual 2d layer fillings of @xmath31 .",
    "this excitement was due , in part , to the obvious violation of the famous `` odd - denominator rule '' governing virtually all previously known fqhe states @xcite . like the famous @xmath32 fqhe in single layer systems ,",
    "the @xmath30 bilayer fqhe is due entirely to electron - electron interactions .",
    "the same bilayer 2d systems that exhibited a @xmath30 quantized hall plateau at @xmath29 also displayed one at @xmath3  where @xmath33 .",
    "for a balanced bilayer the individual filling factors are therefore @xmath34 . owing to a remarkable broken symmetry , spontaneous interlayer phase coherence ( the source of `` which layer '' uncertainty )",
    ", the @xmath3  state has turned out to be far more interesting than the @xmath30 state .",
    "indeed , the @xmath3  state exhibits several remarkable transport properties not shared by any other experimentally observed quantum hall state .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays the early transport data which first revealed the @xmath3  and @xmath30 bilayer qhe states @xcite .",
    "in the pseudospin language @xcite the ground state wavefunction for the balanced @xmath3  bilayer at small layer separation is well - approximated by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are pseudospin eigenstates representing electrons definitely in the `` top '' and `` bottom '' 2d layers , respectively , while the product runs over all the momentum eigenstates @xmath38 in the lowest landau level .",
    "( the true spin of the electrons is not indicated in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] and is assumed to be fully polarized along the magnetic field direction . )",
    "it is clear from the structure of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] that @xmath39 represents a single fully - filled landau level of electrons , each of which is in a coherent linear superposition of top and bottom layer states ( and thus exhibiting `` which layer '' uncertainty ) .",
    "the phase @xmath40 is the same for all electrons and , in the absence of extrinsic symmetry - breaking fields , is arbitrary .",
    "the state @xmath39 is ( pseudo- ) ferromagnetically ordered with total moment lying in the @xmath8 plane , inclined by the angle @xmath40 relative to the @xmath41-axis .",
    "the onset of ferromagnetic order ( in this case a breaking of u(1 ) symmetry ) is spontaneous , driven by strong intra- and interlayer exchange energies .",
    "interlayer tunneling , which is never completely absent , explicitly breaks the u(1 ) symmetry by adding , in effect , a pseudo - magnetic field along the @xmath41 axis of pseudospin space .",
    "tunneling thus does not disrupt the ferromagnetic order , but it does tend to orient the moment by favoring symmetric ( @xmath42 ) bilayer eigenstates .    in second - quantized notation the ground state given in eq.[eq1 ] is written @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) creates an electron of momentum @xmath46 in the lowest landau level in the top ( bottom ) layer out of a vacuum state @xmath47 containing no conduction band electrons in either layer . alternatively , if a vacuum state @xmath48 consisting of a filled lowest landau level in the top layer but no electrons in the bottom layer is used , then @xmath39 becomes @xmath49 written in this way the exciton condensation picture is clearly revealed .",
    "the operator @xmath50 simultaneously creates a hole in the top layer and an electron in the bottom layer , each of momentum @xmath46 in the lowest landau level .",
    "as expected , the average number of such excitons in the ( balanced ) @xmath3  state is one - half the total number of electrons in the bilayer .",
    "the similarity of eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] to the bcs ground state of a conventional superconductor is also obvious @xcite . in that case",
    "the vacuum is a filled fermi sea ; here it is filled lowest landau level in one layer .",

    "figure [ phasediag ] shows the first attempt to establish a phase diagram for the @xmath3  bilayer system @xcite . each red or blue circle in the figure gives the coordinates of a distinct bilayer sample in a dimensionless layer separation  tunneling strength plane .",
    "the center - to - center quantum well separation @xmath13 is normalized by the magnetic length @xmath62 at @xmath3 , while the tunneling strength is parameterized by the splitting @xmath63  ( @xmath64 ) between the lowest symmetric and anti - symmetric eigenstates of the double well structure , normalized by the mean coulomb energy @xmath65 at @xmath3 .",
    "the blue circles indicate samples which do display a quantized hall effect at @xmath3  ( with @xmath66 ) , while the red circles denote samples that do not .",
    "the figure reveals a clear separation between a qhe regime at small @xmath12   and a non - qhe regime at large @xmath12 .",
    "the figure also shows that the domain occupied by the qhe phase grows smoothly as the tunneling strength is increased .",

    "furthermore , the transition between the non - qhe and qhe phases at @xmath3  illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] appears to be coincident with the onset of the more exotic transport phenomena ( giant zero bias tunneling conductance @xcite , vanishing counterflow hall resistance @xcite , etc . ) which are the main subjects of this article .",
    "the precise nature of the transition between the non - qhe phase of the @xmath3  bilayer system at large @xmath12  and the excitonic qhe phase at small @xmath12  remains poorly understood .",

    "figure [ tunnel2 ] shows interlayer tunneling data at @xmath3  taken at low temperature ( @xmath70 mk ) and small effective layer separation ( @xmath12=1.61 ) ; these conditions place the system well within the coherent excitonic phase .",

    "the width of the peak ( about 6 @xmath73v for the data in fig .",
    "[ tunnel2 ] ) grows steadily with increasing temperature .",
    "the current - voltage ( @xmath74 ) data shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ tunnel2 ] are suggestive of the dc josephson effect @xcite . the device appears to allow tunneling currents up to maximum , or critical value ( about 17 pa here ) with virtually no voltage appearing across the junction . beyond this `` supercurrent '' branch the tunneling current falls and significant interlayer voltage develops",
    "this resistive portion of the @xmath74 characteristic exhibits two distinct regions .",
    "first , there is the very rapid fall of the tunneling current just beyond zero bias .",
    "this region corresponds to the deep negative differential conductance spikes in the @xmath71 data shown in the upper panel , and is analogous to the resistive state of a superconducting josephson junction with a time - varying phase difference @xmath75 across it .",
    "second , there is the broad peak in the tunneling current at relatively high voltages ( @xmath76 mv ) .",
    "this second feature in the @xmath74 reflects high - energy incoherent tunneling processes which have little to do with the coherent excitonic ground state of the bilayer .",
    "this broad peak in the @xmath74 remains virtually unchanged as @xmath12  is increased beyond the critical point and the bilayer becomes essentially two independent 2d electron systems @xcite .",
    "the data shown in fig .",
    "[ tunnel2 ] were obtained from a simple two - terminal conductance measurement . as such",
    ", they include the effects of all resistances in series with the tunnel junction itself . at the most fundamental level",
    "there are `` contact resistances '' of order @xmath77 associated with the injection of current into the bilayer quantum hall state @xcite .",
    "these quantum hall contact resistances can not be removed , and in fact eliminate the possibility of observing a true dc josephson effect in the _ two - terminal _ @xmath74 characteristic .",
    "more mundane effects also contribute to the net series resistance @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , significant resistances can be encountered in the 2d electron gas `` arms '' which lead from the ohmic contacts to the gated portion of the device where the coherent excitonic phase exists . in the end",
    ", @xmath78 can be large ; @xmath79 k@xmath80 is not uncommon .",
    "this series resistance has various consequences .",
    "first , it obviously limits the maximum observable two - terminal tunneling conductance to @xmath81 .",
    "second , the series resistance exaggerates the apparent width of the tunneling resonance @xcite .",
    "both of these effects are present to some degree in the data shown in fig .",
    "[ tunnel2 ] .",
    "the series resistance can also create instabilities and hysteresis in the tunneling @xmath74 curve .",
    "these instabilities first appear when the negative differential resistance of the junction precisely cancels the positive series resistance in the external circuit @xcite .",
    "this is a common phenomenon among circuits ( e.g. tunnel diode oscillators ) containing strongly non - linear elements . in electrical engineering language",
    ", one says that the instabilities occur when the `` load line '' ( determined by the voltage source and series resistances ) intersects the intrinsic @xmath74 curve of the non - linear element at more than one point .",
    "for the data in fig .",
    "[ tunnel2 ] this does not occur since the @xmath82 negative differential resistance is @xmath83 m@xmath80 , while the series resistance is only about 100 k@xmath80 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath74 curve remains single - valued .",
    "however , recent experiments @xcite on devices with much larger tunneling conductances clearly display the instabilities .    in order to avoid the distorting effects of the series resistance and",
    "more faithfully expose the intrinsic @xmath74 of the tunnel junction , a four - terminal technique must be employed .",
    "two additional ohmic contacts , one on each 2d layer , are used to directly sense the interlayer voltage present when tunneling current flows .",
    "figure [ 2v4 ] clearly displays the difference between the two- and four - terminal @xmath74 characteristics of a strongly tunneling @xmath3  device .",
    "the figure shows both the distortion of the two - terminal @xmath74 curve and the instability near the critical current . owing to the instability",
    ", the four - terminal voltage jumps discontinuously between essentially zero and a finite value as the critical current is approached . as a result , important region of the intrinsic four - terminal @xmath74",
    "is excluded from measurement in strongly tunneling devices @xcite .",
    "the data shown in figs .",
    "[ tunnel2 ] and [ 2v4 ] suggest the existence of a maximal , or critical current @xmath84 for interlayer tunneling in the coherent @xmath3  bilayer system .",
    "experiments @xcite have shown that @xmath84 grows continuously from zero as @xmath12  is decreased below a critical value of about @xmath85 . at elevated temperatures",
    "the slope of the four - terminal @xmath74 curve at zero bias becomes less steep and the maximum tunneling current occurs at finite voltage .",
    "this maximum current falls steadily as the temperature is increased .",
    "there is by now substantial experimental evidence that interlayer tunneling in the @xmath3  bilayer qhe state is uniformly spread across the area of the device @xcite .",
    "for example , recent experiments using corbino annular geometries have shown the critical current to be virtually identical independent of how far apart the source and drain contacts are .",
    "figure [ tunnel3 ] illustrates this with plots of @xmath84 vs. temperature for three different contact pairs , the distance between which varies by a factor of 3 .",
    "while this rules out a scenario in which tunneling is proportional to the perimeter of the @xmath3  quantum hall droplet , it might seem to leave open the possibility that the tunneling is confined to small `` hot spots '' near the source and drain .",
    "this however conflicts with the clearly observed dependence of @xmath84 on the area of the @xmath3  droplet and with the very recent remarkable observation that when current is injected and withdrawn from @xmath86 remote contact pairs , the same critical current applies to the @xmath4 current injected into the device @xcite .",
    "the area scaling of the tunneling conductance seems at first surprising since the in - plane conductivity @xmath18 of a 2d electron system is heavily suppressed when a quantum hall state is present . without any in - plane conductivity , tunneling would presumably be confined to the boundaries of the 2d system where the source and drain contacts reside . in the @xmath3  excitonic qhe state this obstacle might be overcome by the unusual condensate transport mechanism it possesses .",
    "this mechanism , of course , is exciton , or counterflow transport , and it seems tailor - made to accommodate bulk interlayer tunneling which necessarily involves counter - propagating currents in the two 2d layers .",
    "unfortunately , this argument , however appealing , is too glib . in steady state",
    ", charge conservation requires that the divergence of the counterflow current density , @xmath87 , match the tunneling current density @xmath88 sin@xmath40 ( where @xmath59 is the pseudo - spin stiffness , @xmath63  the single - particle tunnel splitting , and @xmath40 the condensate phase ) .",
    "a natural length scale , analogous to the josephson penetration length , emerges : @xmath89 . as a result ,",
    "interlayer tunneling currents are confined to within @xmath90 of sample boundaries . since estimates of @xmath90",
    "are typically in the @xmath73 m range , and typical tunneling devices are much larger , this picture conflicts with the experimental evidence for bulk interlayer tunneling .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since the same line of argument predicts tunneling critical currents which scale linearly with @xmath63  and are far larger than those observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "the small magnitude of the observed critical currents and their scaling with the area of macroscopic tunnel junctions are two examples of the substantial quantitative discrepancy between the theory of an ideal , disorder - free bilayer @xmath3  system and the actual samples available to experimentalists .",
    "an additional notable example is the poorly understood effect of an in - plane magnetic field @xmath91  on the tunnel resonance . while early tunneling experiments @xcite successfully employed in - plane magnetic fields to identify the expected linearly dispersing goldstone collective mode arising from the spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry of the pseudo - ferromagnetic , or excitonic , ground state @xcite ,",
    "the signatures of these modes were very weak . instead of the expected splitting of the tunneling conductance peak @xcite , the dominant effect of the in - plane field was to suppress the peak height while the collective modes appeared only as subtle satellite features .",
    "there have been numerous theoretical efforts to include the effects of disorder on the @xmath3  tunneling problem @xcite .",

    "<S> the condensation of excitons , bound electron - hole pairs in a solid , into a coherent collective electronic state was predicted over 50 years ago . perhaps surprisingly , the phenomenon was first observed in a system consisting of two closely - spaced parallel two - dimensional electron gases in a semiconductor double quantum well . at an appropriate high magnetic field and low temperature , the bilayer electron system condenses into a state resembling a superconductor , only with the cooper pairs replaced by excitons comprised of electrons in one layer bound to holes in the other . in spite of being charge neutral </S>",
    "<S> , the transport of excitons within the condensate gives rise to several spectacular electrical effects . </S>",
    "<S> this article describes these phenomena and examines how they inform our understanding of this unique phase of quantum electronic matter . </S>"
