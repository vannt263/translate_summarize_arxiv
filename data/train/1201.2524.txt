    "the set of maximally entangled states is thus equivalent to @xmath20 .",
    "the structure of the set @xmath17 and other sets of locally equivalent entangled states of a bipartite system was studied in @xcite .    in this work we propose to analyse the geometry of the set of entangled and separable quantum states using the algebraic concepts of the numerical range and numerical shadow of an operator . for any operator @xmath1 acting on the complex hilbert space @xmath21 one defines its _ numerical range _",

    "the differential topology and projection aspects of numerical range were investigated in @xcite    the standard notion of numerical range , often used in the theory of quantum information @xcite , can be generalized in several ways @xcite .",
    "for instance , for an operator acting on a composite hilbert space one defines the _ product _ numerical range @xcite ( also called _",

    "one defines the shadow with respect to _",
    "separable _ states or _ maximally entangled _ states .",
    "the restrictions can be combined so one can consider the shadow restricted e.g. to real separable states , or in the case of operators acting on @xmath39 dimensional space , which describes a three  qubit system , one may study the shadow with respect to real @xmath11 states or complex @xmath12states",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "some basic properties of the numerical range and the numerical shadow are reviewed . in section 3",
    "we discuss numerical shadow restricted to real states .",
    "in the case of operators acting on the hilbert space with a tensor product structure , @xmath43 , one defines classes of separable and maximally entangled states .",
    "numerical ranges restricted to these sets are analysed in section 4 and 5 respectively . in section 6",
    "we show that investigations of trajectories formed by evolving quantum states projected into the plane of the shadow contributes to the understanding the dynamics of quantum entanglement . in section 7",
    "we discuss the simplest case of composite system consisting of three parts and described in the hilbert space @xmath44 . in the set @xmath45 of pure states acting on",
    "this space one defines two classes of entangled states called @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for any operator acting on @xmath46",
    "it is then natural to introduce the shadow restricted to states locally equivalent to @xmath11 or @xmath12 , and these are investigated in section 6 .",
    "elements of a hilbert space are used as basic objects of the quantum theory . a physical system with @xmath2 distinguishable states can be described by an element @xmath7 of the complex hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "it is assumed that such a _ pure quantum state _ is normalized , @xmath47 , so it belongs to the hypersphere of dimension @xmath48 .",
    "one identifies any two states , which differ only by a global phase , @xmath49 .",
    "the set of all pure quantum states @xmath29 acting on @xmath21 is therefore equivalent to the complex projective space , @xmath50 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "any convex combination of projectors onto pure states forms a _",
    "mixed quantum state _ , @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "any such state @xmath54 , also called a density operator , is hermitian , positive and normalized by the trace condition , tr@xmath55 .",
    "thus the set @xmath56 of all density matrices of order @xmath2 forms a convex set of @xmath57 real dimensions .",
    "the projectors corresponding to the extremal points of the set of density operators form the set of pure quantum states , @xmath58 . in the one qubit case , @xmath59 , the set of pure quantum states forms the _ bloch sphere _ , @xmath60 , which in this case is equivalent to the boundary of the bloch ball @xmath61 . for a larger dimension the @xmath62dimensional set of pure states @xmath29 forms only a zero  measure subset of the @xmath63 dimensional boundary of the set @xmath56 .",

    "one distinguishes also the set of _ classical states _ , which are formed by the density matrices diagonal in a certain basis .",

    "each of @xmath2 corners of the simplex represents a classical pure state , and their convex hull is equivalent to @xmath69 . in the one qubit case , @xmath59 , the set @xmath70 of classical states forms an interval which joins two poles of the bloch sphere and traverses across the interior of the bloch ball of one  qubit mixed quantum states .",
    "the definition ( [ range1 ] ) of the numerical range of a matrix @xmath1 of order @xmath2 specifies @xmath23 as the set of expectation values @xmath71 for normalized pure states @xmath7 .",
    "in fact the compact set @xmath23 in the complex plane can be considered as a _ projection _ of the set @xmath56 of quantum states onto a two plane .",

    "for instance , for @xmath59 the projections of the bloch sphere form ellipses ( which could form circles or may reduce an intervals ) , and so the numerical range of any operator @xmath1 of size @xmath59 may be the result .",
    "similarly the numerical range of operators of size @xmath76 can be viewed as projections of the set @xmath77 of single qutrit quantum states , while the numerical range for matrices of order @xmath78 can be associated with projections of the set @xmath79 @xcite .",
