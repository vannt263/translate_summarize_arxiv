    "the launch of the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa)@xcite in the next decade will usher in a new era for gravitational wave detection .",
    "lisa will not only detect the presence of gravitational waves , but also provide detailed information about many thousands of gravitational wave sources , vastly expanding the burgeoning field of gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "the primary sources for lisa are expected to be compact galactic binaries@xcite , supermassive black hole binaries , and extreme mass ratio inspirals .",
    "the gravitational wave signals detected by lisa encode information about the parameters of the binary systems , such as sky locations , masses , and distances , which can be extracted by matched filtering .",
    "studies into the accuracy with which the source parameters can be recovered from the lisa data have been performed for compact galactic binaries@xcite , supermassive black hole binaries@xcite , and extreme mass ratio inspirals@xcite .",
    "it is hoped that lisa will be the first of several efforts to explore the low frequency portion of the gravitational wave spectrum accessible to space borne interferometers .",
    "one possible follow on mission is tentatively named the advanced laser interferometer antenna ( alia)@xcite , featuring a spacecraft configuration similar to that of lisa , with smaller arm lengths and lower noise levels .",
    "the primary mission of alia will be detecting intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , with masses in the range @xmath0 .",
    "information on populations , locations , and event rates could greatly enhance theories of black hole formation and evolution .",
    "another proposed follow on mission is the big bang observer@xcite ( bbo ) .",
    "the bbo will be an extremely sensitive antenna that is designed to detect the gravitational wave background ( gwb ) left by the big bang . according to the standard cosmological picture ,",
    "the gwb is a relic of the early inflationary period of the universe .",
    "just as the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) missions provided information about the universe around the time of last scattering , the bbo should be able to provide information about the earliest moments in the history of the universe .",
    "the current bbo proposal calls for four lisa - like spacecraft constellations , with the orbital configuration shown in figure  [ bbo_location ] .",
    "two of the constellations will be centered on a @xmath1 earth - trailing orbit , rotated @xmath2 with respect to each other in the plane of the constellations .",
    "these constellations will be referred to as the star constellations , as the legs of the constellation sketch out a six pointed star .",
    "the remaining two constellations are to be placed in an earth - like orbit @xmath3 ahead and behind the star constellations .",
    "these two constellations will be referred to as the outrigger constellations .",
    "the purpose of the outrigger constellations is to provide greater angular resolution for foreground sources ( see section  [ multiple_constellations ] for details ) .",
    "the star constellations provide maximum cross - correlation of gravitational wave signals between the two constellations , with minimal correlated noise  @xcite .",
    "the noise in each detector is expected to be independent , so over time the overlap of the noise between the two constellations will tend to average to zero , while the overlap of the signal will grow .",
    "the plan is to deploy the bbo in stages , starting with the star constellation , then adding the outrigger constellations at a later date .",
    "the proposed orbital configuration of the big bang observer.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    figure  [ char_curves ] shows the detector sensitivities for lisa , alia , and bbo , a level for the expected extra - galactic background confusion noise  @xcite , and optimally filtered amplitude plots for equal mass binaries in their last year before coalescence at redshift @xmath4 .",
    "the squares shown on the amplitude plots denote the frequency of the signal one week before coalescence .",
    "the signal from coalescing equal mass binaries at @xmath4 with masses above @xmath5 will be detectable by both alia and bbo .",
    "the bbo will also be able to detect lower mass systems such as neutron star ( ns ) binaries .",
    "however , for coalescing binaries , a large portion of the signal strength is due to the rapid inspiral in the last week , and for @xmath6 binaries at @xmath4 or greater , much of this power is deposited after the signal has crossed the alia sensitivity curve .",
    "sensitivity curves for lisa , alia , and bbo with optimally filtered amplitude plots for equal mass binaries at @xmath4 in their last year before coalescence .",
    "the masses shown are in units of solar masses .",
    "the squares denote the frequency one week from coalescence.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    here we begin by analyzing the parameter resolution of alia for imbhs .",
    "these studies indicate that by including a second identical constellation of spacecraft in a @xmath1 earth - leading orbit , providing a constellation separation of @xmath7 , the parameter resolution will be greatly improved .",
    "we will call this two constellation configuration the advanced laser interferometer antenna in stereo ( alias ) .",
    "we will also address the natural question , given the increases in precision that alias provides relative to alia , what would be gained by adding a second constellation to the lisa mission - the laser interferometer space antenna in stereo ( lisas ) .",
    "lastly , we analyze the parameter resolution of the bbo for nss , @xmath6 , and @xmath8 black holes ( bhs ) , and for the initial deployment phase of the bbo , which we call bbo star , containing the two star constellations of the bbo configuration , but not the outrigger constellations",
    ". we will show that parameter resolution of the bbo and bbo star should be sufficient to detect foreground binary systems , out to and beyond a redshift of @xmath9 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a review of parameter estimation in section  [ review ] . in section  [ multiple_constellations ]",
    "we describe how a pair of well separated detectors can significantly improve the angular resolution for transient sources .",
    "this is followed by our study of the alia mission in section  [ alia_results ] , and a study of our dual - detector variant of the alia mission in section  [ alias_results ] .",
    "results for unequal mass binaries for alia and alias are in section  [ log_mass_distribution_results ] .",
    "the lisa and lisas missions are compared in section  [ lisa_lisas_results ] .",
    "the bbo mission is studied in section  [ bbo_results ] , and results for a down - scoped version of the bbo mission are reported in section  [ bbo_star_results ] .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in our analysis , the orbits of the binaries are treated as quasi - circular and spin effects are neglected .",
    "this leaves nine parameters that will describe the binary systems : sky location ( @xmath10 ) ; inclination and polarization angles ( @xmath11 ) ; reduced and chirp masses ( @xmath12 ) ; time to coalescence ( @xmath13 ) , luminosity distance ( @xmath14 ) , and the initial orbital phase ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the signals are modeled using a truncated second - post newtonian ( @xmath16 ) approximation@xcite whereby the amplitude is kept to newtonian order while the phase is kept to second order . in other words , we only include the dominant second harmonic of the orbital frequency .",
    "the response of a space - borne instrument to a gravitational wave source is encoded in the michelson - like time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) variables  @xcite , @xmath17 .",
    "here the subscript @xmath18 denotes the vertex at which the signal is read out . in the equal - armlength limit",
    ", the tdi signal , @xmath17 , can be formed from a time - delayed combination of michelson signals , @xmath19 , by @xmath20 this differencing cancels the laser phase noise , while preserving the gravitational wave signal . rather than work with the correlated @xmath17 variables directly",
    ", we use the orthogonal signal combinations  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 the @xmath23 combinations cancel the laser phase noise that would otherwise dominate the michelson signals . at high frequencies , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the length of the detector arms",
    ", a third independent data channel @xmath26 becomes available . for frequencies below @xmath27",
    "the @xmath28-channel is insensitive to gravitational waves and can be used as an instrument noise monitor . to simplify our analysis",
    "we did not use the @xmath28-channel . including this channel",
    "would not have had much effect on the trend of our results .",
    "as an example , looking at figure  [ aet_alia_char_curves ] one can see that for alia inclusion of the @xmath28-channel has little to no effect for binaries @xmath29 .",
    "higher mass binaries would have marginally improved signal strength and correspondingly improved resolution of the parameters .",
    "table  [ aet_snr ] contains signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) information for the combined @xmath30 and @xmath31 channels , as well as the @xmath28 channel for equal mass binaries as seen by alia in the year before coalescence .",
    "the snrs in table  [ aet_snr ] are for the final year before coalescence , separated into the contribution from the first @xmath32 weeks and the contribution from the final week .",
    "sensitivity curves for the @xmath33 , and @xmath28 channels for alia with optimally filtered amplitude plots for equal mass binaries at @xmath4 in their last year before coalescence .",
    "the masses shown are in units of solar masses .",
    "the squares denote the frequency one week from coalescence.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    .snrs for the @xmath28 channel and the combined snrs for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 channels as seen by alia for the equal mass binaries located at @xmath4 . [",

    "binary system constituents in this plot have equal masses and are located at @xmath9.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "while our survey is by no means comprehensive , it has helped to map out the science that can be done with the alia and bbo missions .",
    "we have shown that alias , a modest extension to the alia mission , would be able to return a far more accurate census of the imbh population .",
    "in addition we have shown that a similar extension to lisa would greatly improve its ability to locate the host galaxies of coalescing binaries .",
    "on the other hand , if we are willing to give up some of the precision astronomy offered by the full bbo , we could get by with just the first phase of the bbo deployment .",
    "the bbo star configuration could satisfy the primary goal of detecting the cgb , while still providing a detailed binary census ."
