    "with wireless devices getting smaller and more energy - efficient , energy harvesting is emerging as a potential technology for powering such low - power devices .",
    "a related area is rf ( radio frequency ) or wireless energy harvesting where an energy harvesting device extracts energy from the incident rf signals @xcite .",
    "this is attractive for future paradigms such as the internet of things , where powering a potentially massive number of devices will be a major challenge @xcite .",
    "many of these energy harvesting devices will need to sense and communicate information to a cloud or control unit .",
    "in contrast to most wireless systems designed for internet access , energy harvesting communication systems will likely make exclusive use of short packets .",
    "this is due to intrinsically small data payloads , low - latency requirements , and/or lack of energy resources to support longer transmissions@xcite .    for an energy harvesting system with short packets , the capacity analysis conducted in the asymptotic blocklength regime could be misleading",
    "this has spurred research characterizing the performance of an energy harvesting communication system in the non - asymptotic or finite blocklength regime @xcite .",
    "leveraging the finite - length information theoretic framework proposed in @xcite , @xcite characterized the achievable rate for a noiseless binary communications channel with an energy harvesting transmitter .",
    "this work was extended to the case of an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel and more general discrete memoryless channels in @xcite .",
    "for an energy harvesting transmitter operating under a save - then - transmit protocol @xcite , the achievable rate at the receiver was characterized in the finite blocklength regime@xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite investigated the mean delay of an energy harvesting channel in the finite blocklength regime . unlike the work in @xcite which assume an infinite battery at the energy harvester , @xcite conducted a finite - blocklength analysis for the case of a battery - less energy harvesting channel .    in this paper , we analyze the performance of a wireless - powered communication system where an rf energy harvesting node , charged by a power beacon via wireless energy transfer , attempts to communicate with a receiver over an awgn channel . using the framework of finite - length information theory@xcite ,",
    "we characterize the energy supply probability and the achievable rate of the considered system for the case of short packets . leveraging the analytical results",
    ", we expose the interplay between key system parameters such as the harvest and transmit blocklengths , the average harvested power , and the transmit power .",
    "we also provide closed - form analytical expressions for the asymptotically optimal transmit power .",
    "numerical results reveal that the asymptotically optimal transmit power is also approximately optimal for the finite blocklength regime .",
    "the prior work @xcite treating short packets falls short of characterizing the performance for the case of wireless energy harvesting .",
    "moreover , most prior work @xcite implicitly assumes concurrent harvest and transmit operation , which may be infeasible in practice .",
    "we consider a wireless - powered communication system where a wireless power beacon ( pb ) charges an energy harvesting ( eh ) device , which then attempts to communicate with another receiver ( rx ) using the harvested energy .",
    "the nodes are equipped with a single antenna each .",
    "we assume that the energy harvester uses a _",
    "save - then - transmit _",
    "protocol @xcite to enable wireless - powered communications .",
    "the considered protocol divides the communication frame consisting of @xmath0 channel uses ( or slots ) into an energy harvesting phase having @xmath1 channel uses , and an information transmission phase having @xmath2 channel uses .",
    "the first @xmath1 channel uses are used for harvesting energy from the rf signals transmitted by the power beacon , which is then saved in a ( sufficiently large ) energy buffer .",
    "this is followed by an information transmission phase consisting of @xmath2 channel uses , where the transmitter uses the harvested energy to transmit information to the receiver .",
    "we call @xmath1 the _ harvest _ blocklength , @xmath2 the _ transmit _ blocklength , and @xmath3 the _ total _ blocklength or frame size",
    ". we will conduct the subsequent analysis for the non - asymptotic blocklength regime , i.e. , for the practical case of _ short packets _ where the total blocklength is finite .      the signal transmitted by a power beacon experiences distance - dependent path loss and channel fading before reaching the energy harvesting node .",
    "the harvested energy is , therefore , a random quantity due to the underlying randomness of the wireless link .",
    "we let random variable @xmath4 model the energy harvested in slot @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 denotes the harvester efficiency , @xmath8 is the pb transmit power , @xmath9 gives the average large - scale channel gain , while the random variable @xmath10 denotes the small - scale channel gain .",
    "note that we have ignored the energy due to noise since it is negligibly small .",
    "we consider quasi - static block flat rayleigh fading for the pb - eh links such that the channel remains constant over a block , and randomly changes to a new value for the next block .",
    "in other words , the energy arrivals within a harvesting phase are fully correlated , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath13\\triangleq p_{\\rm{e}}=\\eta\\beta p_{\\rm{pb}}$ ] .",
    "this is motivated by the observation that the harvest blocklength in a _ short - packet _ communications system would typically be smaller than the channel coherence time .",
    "the energy harvesting phase is followed by an information transmission phase where the eh node attempts to communicate with a destination rx node over an unreliable awgn channel .",
    "we assume that the eh node uses a gaussian codebook for signal transmission ( see section [ secit ] ) .",
    "we let @xmath14 be the signal intended for transmission in slot @xmath15 with average power @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "the resulting ( intended ) sequence @xmath18 consists of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) gaussian random variables such that @xmath14 .17ex  @xmath19 . to transmit the intended sequence @xmath20 over the transmit blocklength , the eh node needs to satisfy the following energy constraints .",
    "@xmath21 the constraints in ( [ eq : constraint ] ) simplify to @xmath22 for the case of correlated energy arrivals .",
    "we let @xmath23 be the transmitted sequence .",
    "note that @xmath24 when the energy constraints are violated as the eh node lacks sufficient energy to put the intended symbols on the channel .",
    "the signal received at the destination node in slot @xmath15 is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is an iid sequence modeling the receiver noise such that @xmath27 is a zero - mean gaussian random variable with variance @xmath28 .",
    "note that any deterministic channel attenuation for the eh - rx link can be equivalently tackled by scaling the noise variance .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath29 as the received sequence .",
    "we now describe the information theoretic preliminaries for the eh - rx link .",
    "let us assume that the eh node transmits a message @xmath30 over @xmath2 channel uses .",
    "assuming @xmath31 is drawn uniformly from @xmath32 , we define an @xmath33-code having the following features : it uses a set of encoding functions @xmath34 for encoding the source message @xmath30 given the energy harvesting constraints , i.e. , the source node uses @xmath35 for transmission slot @xmath15 , where @xmath36 given @xmath37 such that the energy harvesting constraint in ( [ eq : constraint ] ) is satisfied . specifically , @xmath38 where @xmath39.17ex  @xmath19 is drawn iid from a gaussian codebook when ( [ eq : constraint ] ) is satisfied , and @xmath40 otherwise .",
    "it uses a decoding function @xmath41 that produces the output @xmath42 , where @xmath29 is the sequence received at the destination node .",
    "we let @xmath43 denote the target error probability for the noisy communication link . for @xmath44 , an @xmath45-code for an awgn eh channel",
    "is defined as the @xmath33-code for an awgn channel such that the average probability of decoding error @xmath46 does not exceed @xmath47 .",
    "a rate @xmath48 is _",
    "@xmath47-achievable _ for an awgn eh channel if there exists a sequence of @xmath49-codes such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the _ @xmath47-capacity _",
    "@xmath52 for an awgn eh channel is defined as @xmath53 .",
    "we now introduce the metrics used for characterizing the performance of the considered _ short - packet _ wireless - powered communications system .",
    "note that the overall performance is marred by two key events .",
    "first , due to lack of sufficient energy , the eh node may not be able to transmit the intended codewords during the information transmission phase , possibly causing a decoding error at the receiver .",
    "second , due to a noisy eh - rx channel , the received signal may not be correctly decoded . for the former ,",
    "we define a metric called the _ energy supply probability _ , namely , the probability @xmath54 $ ] that an eh node can support the intended transmission . for the latter ,",
    "we define and characterize the _",
    "@xmath47-achievable rate _ in the finite blocklength regime .",
    "in this section , we characterize the energy supply probability and the achievable rate in the finite blocklength regime .",
    "we define the _ energy supply probability _ @xmath55 as the probability that an eh node has sufficient energy to transmit the intended codeword , namely , @xmath56\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a harvest blocklength @xmath1 , a transmit blocklength @xmath2 , and a power ratio @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath58 as the _ energy outage probability _ at the energy harvesting node .",
    "the following proposition characterizes the energy supply probability for the considered system .    assuming the intended transmit symbols @xmath59 are drawn iid from @xmath60 , the energy sequence @xmath61 is fully correlated , and @xmath62 follows an exponential law with mean @xmath63 , the energy supply probability is given by @xmath64 for @xmath65 where @xmath66 , while @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the blocklengths for the harvest and the transmit phase .",
    "the proof follows by leveraging the statistical properties of the random variables .",
    "consider @xmath67          \\overset{(a)}{=}\\pr\\left[w \\leq \\frac{mz}{p_\\textrm{t}}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\      & \\overset{(b)}{=}\\mathbb{e}_{w}\\left[e^{-\\frac{p_\\textrm{t}}{p_{\\rm{e}}m}w}\\right ]      \\overset{}{=}\\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\frac{2a}{m}\\right)^\\frac{n}{2 } }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( @xmath68 ) follows from the substitution @xmath69 where @xmath31 is a chi - squared random variable with @xmath2 degrees of freedom .",
    "( @xmath70 ) is obtained by conditioning on the random variable @xmath31 , and by further noting that @xmath62 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath63 .",
    "assuming @xmath65 , the last equation follows from the definition of the moment generating function of a chi - squared random variable .    while proposition 1 is valid for @xmath65 , we note that this is the case of practical interest since it is desirable to operate at @xmath71 , as evident from section [ secsim ] .",
    "further , the expression in ( [ eq : p_ec single pb ] ) makes intuitive sense as the energy outages would increase with the transmit blocklength @xmath2 for a given @xmath1 , and decrease with the harvest blocklength @xmath1 for a given @xmath2 .",
    "let us fix @xmath16 and @xmath63 .",
    "for a given @xmath1 , we may improve the reliability of the eh - rx communication link by increasing the blocklength @xmath2 , albeit at the expense of the energy supply probability . with a smaller transmit power @xmath16 ,",
    "the energy harvester is less likely to run out of energy during an ongoing transmission .",
    "therefore , when @xmath72 is fixed , we may reduce @xmath16 to meet the energy supply constraint , but this would reduce the channel signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . this underlying tension between the energy availability and the communication reliability will be highlighted throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "the following discussion relates the transmit power to the harvest and transmit blocklengths , illustrating some of the key tradeoffs .",
    "the energy supply probability is more sensitive to the length of the transmit phase compared to that of the harvest phase .",
    "this observation also manifests itself in terms of the energy requirements at the transmitter .",
    "for instance , to maintain an energy supply probability @xmath73 , it follows from ( [ eq : p_ec single pb ] ) that the power ratio satisfies @xmath74 .",
    "note that the power ratio varies only linearly with the harvest blocklength @xmath1 , but superlinearly with the transmit blocklength @xmath2 .",
    "this further implies that for a fixed @xmath2 , doubling the harvest blocklength relaxes the transmit power budget by the same amount .",
    "that is , the energy harvester can double its transmit power @xmath16 ( and therefore the channel snr ) without violating the required energy constraints .",
    "in contrast , reducing the transmit blocklength for a given @xmath1 brings about an exponential increase in the transmit power budget at the energy harvester .",
    "the following corollary treats the scaling behavior of the energy supply probability as the blocklength becomes large .",
    "when the harvest blocklength @xmath1 scales in proportion to the transmit blocklength @xmath2 such that @xmath75 for some constant @xmath76 , the energy supply probability @xmath55 converges to a limit as @xmath2 becomes asymptotically large .",
    "in other words , @xmath77 such that the limit only depends on the power ratio @xmath78 and the proportionality constant @xmath76 . further , under proportional blocklength scaling , this limit also serves as an upper bound on the energy supply probability for finite blocklengths , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "the previous corollary also shows that energy outage is a fundamental bottleneck regardless of the blocklength , assuming at best linear scaling .",
    "the following result characterizes the @xmath47-achievable rate of the considered wireless - powered communication system in the finite blocklength regime .",
    "given a target error probability @xmath44 for the noisy channel , the @xmath47-achievable rate @xmath80 of the considered system with harvest blocklength @xmath1 , transmit blocklength @xmath2 , power ratio @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 ) , and the snr @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 for all tuples @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86\\right)^4}\\right)-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath87    see appendix .",
    "for a given target error probability @xmath47 , a harvest blocklength @xmath1 can support a transmit blocklength only as large as in ( [ eq : mainc2 ] ) .",

    "finally , ( c ) follows by noting that @xmath100 .",
    "proposition 2 reveals a fundamental communications limit of the considered wireless - powered system . in order to guarantee an @xmath47-reliable communication over @xmath2 channel uses ,",
    "the node first needs to accumulate sufficient energy during the initial harvesting phase .",
    "a sufficiently large @xmath1 helps improve the energy availability at the transmitter .",
    "this harvesting overhead , however , causes a rate loss ( versus a non - energy harvesting system ) as the first @xmath1 channel uses are reserved for harvesting .",
    "moreover , as the transmit blocklength @xmath2 grows , so does the length of the initial harvesting phase @xmath1 , resulting in an inescapable performance limit on the communication system .",
    "this limit depends on i ) the power ratio @xmath81 , and ii ) the required reliability @xmath47 , and is captured by the prelog term @xmath101 in ( [ eq : prpo2a ] ) for a given @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , this behavior is more visible for latency - constrained systems where the total blocklength is fixed .    as the power ratio @xmath103 in ( [ eq : prop2 ] ) , the asymptotic achievable rate converges to the capacity of a non - energy harvesting awgn channel , i.e. , @xmath104 .    for optimal performance ,",

    "for a given @xmath63 , there exists an optimal transmit power that maximizes the achievable rate .",

    "[ fig : p_opt vs pe ] ) .",
    "moreover , the achievable rate in the non - asymptotic regime obtained using the asymptotically optimal transmit power , gives a tight lower bound for the optimal achievable rate in the non - asymptotic regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rate vs. error ] ) .",
    "this suggests that corollary 3 provides a useful analytical handle for transmit power selection even for the finite blocklength regime ( despite the fact that the resulting rate for the non - asymptotic case could be much smaller than that for the asymptotic case ) .",
