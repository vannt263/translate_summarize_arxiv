    "the moduli stabilization problem is one of the central in search for realistic string theory vacua in four dimensions . on one hand ,",
    "the existence of massless scalar fields is in conflict with experiment . on the other , the four - dimensional gravitational and gauge coupling constants depend on the values of the moduli .",
    "therefore , in any realistic string compactification , all moduli have to be stabilized in a phenomenologically acceptable range .",
    "another four - dimensional quantity , apparently intrinsically related to the moduli stabilization problem , is the cosmological constant .",
    "recently , substantial progress in this direction was achieved in the work of kachru , kallosh , linde and trivedy @xcite . in the context of type iib flux compactifications @xcite manifolds in  @xcite ] , in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that it is possible to stabilize all moduli in a metastable de sitter ( ds ) vacuum .",
    "the stabilization procedure in @xcite was performed in two steps . at step one ,",
    "all moduli were stabilized in an anti de sitter ( ads ) minimum .",
    "this was done by balancing fluxes against non - perturbative effects @xcite . at step two",
    ", it was demonstrated that the minimum can be lifted to a metastable ds vacuum , by adding anti d3-branes to the system .",
    "a crucial ingredient at this step was the result of @xcite that a flux - anti d3-brane system can form a metastable bound state with positive energy .",
    "the effect of combining this positive contribution to the potential energy with the negative supergravity contribution can produce a ds vacuum .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , it was shown that it is possible to fine tune the cosmological constant and make it consistent with observations .",
    "later , moduli stabilization in this type iib scenario was explored in more detail in @xcite .",
    "it is a natural question whether a similar moduli stabilization procedure can be fulfilled in a more realistic framework of strongly coupled heterotic string theory , or , heterotic m - theory @xcite .",
    "such compactifications have a lot of phenomenologically attractive features ( see @xcite for a recent review on phenomenological aspects of m - theory ) .",
    "various gut- and standard model - like theories were obtained from heterotic compactifications on a calabi - yau manifold @xcite . the actual particle spectrum in such theories",
    "was recently studied in @xcite .",
    "progress towards construction of ds vacua from heterotic m - theory was recently reported in @xcite , based on the earlier work @xcite .",
    "a ds vacuum was obtained by balancing two non - perturbative effects , gaugino condensate @xcite and open membrane instantons @xcite as well as by using perturbative potentials for charged matter fields . despite obvious progress , this method has certain shortcomings .",
    "first , not all moduli have been stabilized . in particular , complex structure moduli remained unfixed . in order to stabilize them , apparently , it is necessary to introduce flux - induced superpotentials @xcite .",
    "however , results from @xcite suggest that that such superpotentials tend to stabilize moduli in ads minima .",
    "second , authors in @xcite gave vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to the charged matter fields .",
    "this breaks the low - energy gauge group down to nothing unless the vevs are under control .",
    "one more problem is that it seems hard to stabilize all run away moduli this way .",
    "this , though , might be avoided by using non - kahler background @xcite .",
    "it would be great to overcome these problems because in @xcite no fine tuning was required to produce a phenomenologically attractive ds vacuum .    in any case",
    ", it seems important to create a heterotic analogue of @xcite . the first step associated with stabilizing moduli in an ads minimum",
    "was proposed in @xcite in strongly coupled heterotic string theory and in @xcite in the weakly coupled case . in @xcite , it was shown in a very general set - up that all heterotic moduli , including complex and kahler structure moduli , the volume modulus , vector bundle moduli and five - brane moduli , could be stabilized in an ads vacuum in a phenomenologically acceptable range . in this paper , we would like to explore the possibility of performing the second step of @xcite and lifting this ads minimum to a ds minimum . to be more precise ,",
    "we consider two different ways how such a lift can be achieved .",
    "first , we study in detail moduli potentials induced by fayet - iliopoulos terms @xcite .",
    "such terms arise when the low - energy field theory contains an anomalous @xmath2 factor .",
    "the anomaly cancels by the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "the idea that such potentials can produce a ds minimum was suggested by burgess , kallosh and quevedo in @xcite .",
    "we apply this idea for the case of strongly coupled heterotic string theory and argue that , generically , the order of magnitude of such potentials is small enough , so that it is possible to balance them against fluxes and non - perturbative effects .",
    "then we show that it is indeed possible to obtain a metastable ds vacuum along these lines . at this point",
    ", we should note that fayet - iliopoulos terms modify the potential for charged matter fields as well and might be important for understanding issues related to the supersymmetry breaking scale . in this paper",
    ", we will not address these questions .",
    "matter potentials represent an independent difficult problem which requires a serious study .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that it is possible to stabilize all heterotic string moduli in a ds vacuum .    the second method to raise ads",
    "minima that we consider is more universal as it does not put any restrictions on the structure of the low - energy physics .",
    "this method is based on adding anti five - branes in the bulk .",
    "a more general set - up would be to consider the @xmath1 theory with ( anti ) five - branes present in the bulk .",
    "the @xmath3 theory was introduced by fabinger and horava in  @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by a chirality flip at one of the orbifold planes .",
    "this is equivalent to having supergravity on @xmath4 with the gravitino antiperiodic along the circle .",
    "this imples that in the effective field theory , the gravitino will have a mass , whereas in the matter sector , supersymmetry will be preserved , at least at the tree level . in @xcite",
    ", it was argued that the orbifold fixed planes experince the attractive casimir - type force . upon compactifying this theory to four - dimensions on a calabi - yau manifold ,",
    "this effect becomes subleading .",
    "the leading potential is induced by non - trivial charges , depending on the second chern classes of the gauge and the tangent bundles , on these planes .",
    "similar potentials arise if one adds ( anti ) five - branes in either @xmath5 or @xmath3 theory .",
    "however , we obtain that , for a generic compactification , the order of magnitude of this new potential is too big comparing to the order of magnitude of fluxes and non - perturbative effects .",
    "therefore , it destabilizes the vacuum rather than just modifying it . a way to resolve this problem can be to take a calabi - yau which has cycles of various sizes .",
    "then it is possible to decrease this new correction to the potential energy . to do this",
    ", it is necessary to stabilize @xmath6 moduli of the calabi - yau manifold in such a way that various cycles are fixed at different scales .",
    "this problem seems to be related to understanding non - exponential factors in non - perturbative superpoptentials @xcite and will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we consider a system having an ads minimum .",
    "this system involves the volume modulus , the interval modulus , one five - brane modulus and the complex structure moduli .",
    "this is a simplified version of the one studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the remaining moduli of the vector bundle can be stabilized as well .",
    "it was also argued in @xcite that any number of @xmath6 moduli can be stabilized by similar mechanism .",
    "the necessity of a five - brane is dictated by the fact that the non - perturbative superpotential for the interval modulus dies off too fast .",
    "therefore , it is problematic to stabilize it .",
    "however , if the five - brane is located close enough to one of the orbifold fixed plane one can stabilize the interval modulus . the complex structure moduli",
    "are stabilized by the flux - induced superpotential , two out of three remaining moduli are stabilized by balancing run away moduli against the fluxes . for the last modulus , we obtain a purely algebraic equation .",
    "a numeric analysis shows that it is possible to find a solution satisfying all requirements and assumptions . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the contribution to the potential energy induced by fayet - iliopoulos terms @xcite .",
    "the form of the potential is slightly different depending on in what sector there is an anomalous @xmath2 gauge group .",
    "this contribution depends on the volume as well as on the interval and the five - brane moduli .",
    "we estimate its order of magnitude and find that , for a generic compactification , it is comparable with that of fluxes and non - perturbative effects . in section 4 , we consider the system from section 2 and modify the potential energy by a fayet - iliopoulos term . by explicit calculation , we show that it is indeed possible to produce a ds minimum .",
    "we also show that it is also conceivable to obtain a small cosmological constant by fine tuning .",
    "the reason for this is that the supergravity contribution to the cosmological constant can still be kept negative .",
    "however , we note that if the number of moduli is large enough it is very hard to keep the supergravity potential energy negative in the vacuum . as a consequence , in this case",
    ", it is still possible to find a ds minimum but the cosmological constant will always be very large .",
    "even though we do not include vector bundle moduli into our analysis , we comment that it is straightforward to add them without facing conceptual difficulties . in section 5",
    ", we move on to the @xmath7 theory . by simple anomaly arguments along the lines of @xcite",
    ", we find a necessary condition for anomaly free compactifications .",
    "then , we derive the moduli potential in this theory .",
    "we show that a potential with the identical functional structure arises from adding ( anti ) five - branes .",
    "this is , of course , not surprising . in a supersymmetric @xmath8 compactification without anti five - branes , the potential is identically zero as the consequence of the net tension cancellation .",
    "it is interesting to note that this potential can be both positive and negative .",
    "it depends on the calabi - yau volume modulus and on the interval modulus .",
    "even though we do not do explicit calculations with this potential , it is natural to expect that it works as good as fayet - iliopoulos terms .",
    "we estimate its order of magnitude and find that , for a generic compactification , it is not comparable with that of fluxes and non - perturbative effects . we give a brief discussion on what it takes to decrease the order of magnitude of this potential .",
    "the key issue seems to be to learn how to stabilize some of the kahler structure moduli of a calabi - yau manifold at scales sufficiently smaller than the calabi - yau scale .",
    "this method to introduce a correction to the supergravity lagrangian is , in a certain sense , more attractive than to use fayet - iliopoulos terms .",
    "first , it is more universal",
    ". it does not impose any constraints on the structure of the low - energy gauge group .",
    "second , this new contribution to the potential energy can be both positive and negative .",
    "this might be important for the purposes of fine tuning the cosmological constant .    in this paper , we work in the framework of calabi - yau compactifications .",
    "it is natural to expect that similar results should hold in the context of non - kahler compactifications @xcite . in such compactifications ,",
    "the volume of the manifold is stabilized perturbatively .",
    "therefore , the analysis can be very similar from the conceptual viewpoint but simpler technically since a fewer number of moduli is involved .",
    "however , it is hard to say exactly what the structure of kahler potentials and superpotentials is , because the moduli of non - kahler compactifications are not known . in particular",
    ", since there are no @xmath6 moduli , the structure of non - perturbative superpotentials is unclear .",
    "these subtleties require detailed investigations .",
    "as in @xcite , we begin with the construction of the ads minimum .",
    "this was done in a very general setting in @xcite .",
    "here we consider a simplified system where we ignore vector bundle moduli .",
    "the details of their stabilization can be found in @xcite .",
    "we work in the context of the strongly coupled heterotic string theory  @xcite . to one of the orbifold fixed planes we will refer as to the visible brane ( or the visible sector ) , to the other one we will refer as to the hidden brane ( or the hidden sector ) .",
    "the system under study involves the following complex moduli @xmath9 the modulus @xmath10 is related to the volume of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the axion .",
    "the real part of the @xmath13-modulus is the size of the eleventh dimension @xmath14 where @xmath15 comes from the components of the m - theory three - form @xmath16 along the interval and the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "here we have assumed that @xmath17 . in @xcite , it was argued that one should be able to stabilize any number of @xmath6 moduli by solving similar but technically more complicated equations . as in @xcite",
    ", we will do all calculations assuming that there is only one @xmath6 modulus which we denote by @xmath13 .",
    "* y * is the modulus of the five - brane . throughout the paper",
    ", we assume that there is only one five - brane in the bulk wrapping an isolated genus zero curve . in this case",
    ", there is only one five - brane modulus @xcite , whose real part is the position of the five - brane in the bulk @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the axion arising from dualizing the three - form field strength propagating on the five - brane world - volume . at last , by @xmath20",
    "we denote the complex structure moduli .",
    "the actual number of them is not relevant for us .",
    "the moduli @xmath21 and @xmath22 are assumed to be dimensionless normalized with respect to the following reference scales @xmath23 in order to obtain the four - dimensional coupling constants in the correct phenomenological range @xcite , the corresponding moduli should be stabilized at ( or be slowly rolling near ) the values @xmath24 the kahler potential for this system is as follows @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the four - dimensional planck scale and @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the area of the cycle on which the five - brane is wrapped and @xmath32 is @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the eleven - dimensional gravitational coupling constant .",
    "it is related to the four - dimensional planck mass as @xmath35 evaluating @xmath29 by using and gives @xmath36 generically this coefficient is of order one .",
    "the superpotential for this system consists of three different contributions @xmath37 @xmath38 is the flux - induced superpotential @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the neveu - schwarz three form . in m - theory notation",
    "it can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the m - theory four - form flux .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath38 was estimated in @xcite and was found to be , generically , of order @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , this is flexible .",
    "the superpotential @xmath38 may receive certain higher order corrections from chern - simons invariants . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that this chern - simons invariants can reduce the order of magnitude of @xmath38 .",
    "we will assume in this paper that the order of magnitude of @xmath38 is approximately @xmath44 in planck units .",
    "it is well known that perturbatively a @xmath45 neveu - schwarz flux ( or , equivalently , a @xmath46 @xmath42-flux in m - theory ) breaks supersymmetry .",
    "therefore , the idea is to balance the superpotential against the non - perturbative contributions @xmath47 and @xmath48 . at this point",
    ", it is appropriate to mention that we are not allowing @xmath49 components of the m - theory @xmath42-flux which leads to non - kahler compactifications @xcite .",
    "the flux introduced above provides only a perturbative deformation of the calabi - yau metric .    by @xmath47",
    "we denote the superpotential induced by a gaugino condensate in the hidden sector @xcite .",
    "a non - vanishing gaugino condensate has important phenomenological consequences . among other things ,",
    "it is responsible for supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector .",
    "when that symmetry breaking is transported to the observable brane , it leads to soft supersymmetry breaking terms for the gravitino , gaugino and matter fields @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite for a good review on gaugino condensation in string theory .",
    "this superpotential has the following structure @xmath50 the order of magnitude of @xmath51 is approximately @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath53 is related to the coefficient @xmath54 of the one - loop beta - function and is given by @xmath55 for example , for the @xmath56 gauge group @xmath57 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath58 represents the tension ( up to the minus sign ) of the hidden brane @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the kahler form and @xmath61 is the curvature of the gauge bundle on the hidden brane .",
    "similarly , the coefficient @xmath62 is the tension of the five - brane .",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the four - form poincare dual to the holomorphic curve on which the five - brane is wrapped .",
    "generically both @xmath58 and @xmath62 are of order one .",
    "in fact , from eqs .  , and and",
    "it follows that @xmath65 the quantity @xmath66 represents the inverse square of the gauge coupling constant in the hidden sector , @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , it can not become negative .",
    "this , in particular , says that the superpotential   can not be trusted for large values of the interval length @xmath68 .",
    "we believe that higher order corrections to the combination will make the gauge coupling constant well defined for large values of @xmath68 .",
    "partial support for this comes from the work of curio and krause @xcite who showed that the next order order @xmath13-correction to @xmath67 is indeed positive .",
    "the difficulty with understanding @xmath47 for sufficiently large values of @xmath68 leads to necessity of introducing five - branes and non - perturbative superpotentials .",
    "if we ignore the @xmath69-modulus and restrict ourselves to the @xmath70-system with the superpotential @xmath71 it is straightforward to show that the potential energy is strictly positive definite unless @xmath72 this , apparently , implies that we can not trust @xmath73 in the form and have to include higher order corrections . instead of doing that , we will add the five - brane and show that it is possible to find an interesting solution without running into troubles with the imaginary gauge coupling constant .",
    "one more problem with the superpotential is that it can stabilize only one linear combination of the imaginary parts of @xmath10 and @xmath13 moduli leaving the remaining one flat . in order to be able to balance @xmath38 and @xmath47 with each other",
    ", their orders of magnitude should approximately be the same .",
    "this is clearly possible , especially with a help of chern - simons invariants , if @xmath74 and @xmath68 and of order one and @xmath75 is positive .",

    "the only situation when these two contributions to the superpotential can compete is when the five - brane is close to one of the orbifold fixed planes . if the five - brane is close to the visible brane then both @xmath77 and @xmath81 will die off very fast and the non - perturbative superpotential will not depend on @xmath13 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath13-modulus can not be stabilized .",
    "therefore , the only way to proceed is to assume that the five - brane is closed to the hidden brane . in this case",
    "@xmath89 for concreteness we assume that the coefficient @xmath90 .",

    "we obtain a potential of the functional form  . as we mentioned before , in the @xmath250 compactification , the potential   vanishes , whereas in the @xmath7 theory it does not .",
    "let us also point out that if one takes care of the terms involving two derivatives of @xmath22 one obtains the kahler potential for this modulus given by the last term in eq .  .",
    "the moduli potential   has a similar functional structure as the fayet - iliopoulos potentials and  .",
    "therefore , potentially , it can be used to raise the ads vacuum discussed in section 2 .",
    "however , we will see that it is not very easy to use this potential to stabilize the moduli .",
    "the problem comes from the overall scale of the potential .",

    ", we can estimate @xmath19 and obtain @xmath253 this order of magnitude is too big . for a generic compactification , it does not seem to be possible to balance @xmath254 against the non - perturbative and the flux - induced superpotentials to provide an interesting moduli stabilization , at least if @xmath17 .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath6 is greater than one and try to determine whether it is ever possible to decrease the coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "let us look more carefully at the combination  .",
    "expanding the kahler form @xmath60 in the basis of harmonic forms @xmath255 @xmath256 where @xmath257 are related to the real parts of the @xmath6 moduli ( see @xcite for details ) , we can write the integral of @xmath258 more explicitly as @xmath259 where @xmath260 are the four - cycles poincare dual to the basis @xmath255 and @xmath261 is the volume of the two - cycle , poincare dual to the four - form @xmath262 measured with respect to the kahler forms @xmath263 .",
    "apparently , the only way to decrease the order of magnitude of @xmath254 is to consider a calabi - yau threefold in which there is at least one very small cycle and to take @xmath264 localized precisely on such a cycle . of course , the four - form that has to be localized on a small cycle does not necessarily have to be @xmath264 .",
    "it does only if there are no ( anti ) five - branes in the bulk . in general , in the @xmath265 theory this four - form is given by @xmath266 + [ \\bar { \\cal w } ] = 2c_2(v_1 ) -c_2(tx ) + 2[{\\cal w } ] , \\label{4.39}\\ ] ] where the anomaly cancellation condition   has been used .",
    "note that @xmath267 ( more precisely @xmath268 ) is not necessarily positive .",
    "therefore , the potential combined with the supergravity one can generate a phenomenologically attractive ds minimum even if the number of moduli is large .",
    "a potential of the form   also exist in the @xmath5 theory with anti five - branes in the bulk .",

    "this potential is strictly positive . in any case",
    ", this type of potentials can be used only if we can find a calabi - yau manifold with relatively small 2-cycles .",
    "of course , what we mean by this is that one has to be able to stabilize at least one of the @xmath6 moduli at a very small scale comparing to the calabi - yau scale .",
    "we will not attempt to solve this problem in this paper .",
    "instead , let us speculate on what could be the key to solving this problem .",
    "the non - perturbative superpotentials discussed in section 2 have factors depending on complex structure and vector bundle moduli  @xcite .",
    "we ignored them as they were not important for our purposes . for certain geometries",
    "those factors were explicitly calculated in  @xcite and found to be high degree polynomials .",
    "if one manages to show that the values of such factors associated to different isolated curves in the calabi - yau threefold can vary a lot , it could stabilize various cycles at different scales .",
    "the high degree polynomials might provide a considerable help .",
    "unfortunately , to study systematically the vector bundle moduli contribution to non - perturbative superpotentials is a very challenging problem .",
    "in this paper , we considered a problem of moduli stabilization in a metastable ds vacuum in the context of strongly coupled heterotic string theory .",
    "we showed that , as in type iib theory @xcite , ds vacua can be constructed by adding various correction to the supergravity potential energy .",
    "we studied two types of such corrections .",
    "the first type corrections are generated by fayet - iliopoulos terms @xcite .",
    "they appear if the low - energy gauge group in the visible or in the hidden sector contains an anomalous @xmath2 factor .",
    "the form of the moduli potential energy is slightly different depending on in which sector there is such a factor .",
    "this potential is always positive .",
    "we showed that the total potential energy indeed can have a ds minimum .",
    "moreover , since the supergravity part of the potential energy can be kept negative , it is possible , by fine tuning , parameters to get a cosmological constant consistent with observations .",
    "however , if the number of moduli is sufficiently large , one can expect that both supergravity and fayet - iliopoulos contributions to the potential energy will become positive and it will not be possible to obtain a small cosmological constant even by fine tuning .",
    "corrections of the second type can be generated if we add anti five - branes in the bulk or , more generally , consider @xmath7 compactifications with both five - branes and anti five - branes involved .",
    "a moduli potential arises since the net tension of various branes does not cancel anymore ( though the net charge does ) .",
    "this potential can , in principle , be both positive and negative .",
    "it is also more universal because its existence does not depend on details of the compactification .",
    "roughly , it has a similar functional form as the fayet - iliopoulos terms .",
    "therefore , it can generate a ds minimum in a similar way .",
    "however , we noticed that , in a generic compactification , its order of magnitude is not small enough and not comparable with that of fluxes and non - perturabtive superpotentials . to make it comparable ,",
    "it is necessary to learn how to stabilize some of the kahler structure moduli at a scale sufficiently smaller than the calabi - yau scale .",
    "one can speculate that this problem is related to understanding of non - exponential factors in non - perturbative superpotentials .",
    "the results of this paper can be considered as the heterotic version of the type iib moduli stabilization mechanism  @xcite . however , there are some new non - trivial elements .",
    "generic heterotic models always have more types of moduli and , hence , more types of superpotentials have to be included . some of them can be trusted only in a certain range of the moduli space .",
    "one more important feature is that it seems hard to avoid five - branes .",
