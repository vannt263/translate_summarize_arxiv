    "projective varieties of complex dimension 2 are basic examples of symplectic fourfolds .",
    "of course , the class of algebraic surfaces is much smaller .",
    "there are many examples of symplectic nonalgebraic varieties with various distinguishing properties ( see @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) . in this note",
    "we focus on embedded curves in the algebraic versus symplectic category .",
    "it is known that an algebraic surface @xmath0 satisfies the following properties :    * the intersection form on the subspace of homology generated by complex curves in @xmath0 is hyperbolic ; * the fundamental group of any smooth ample curve in @xmath0 surjects onto the fundamental group of the surface .",
    "we construct simple examples of symplectic fourfolds violating both of these properties .",
    "the first author is grateful to vik .",
    "kulikov and s. nemirovski for useful discussions .",
    "we would like to thank the organizers of the `` monodromy''-conference in moscow , june 2001 .",
    "both authors were partially supported by the nsf .",
    "let @xmath1 be an orientable compact riemann surface of genus @xmath2 . consider a smooth fibration @xmath3 such that every fiber @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) is a smooth orientable compact riemann surface of genus @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the monodromy along every loop in the base is represented by an orientable automorphism and that @xmath3 admits a smooth section .",
    "this is a well known fact , but we sketch a proof for completeness .",
    "we build a fiberwise nondegenerate form as follows : choose a standard basis of loops @xmath7 of the fundamental group of the base @xmath1 .",
    "each loop defines a monodromy diffeomorphism of @xmath0 ( modulo isotopy ) , denoted by the same letter .",
    "the group @xmath8 of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 admits a contraction onto the group of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "therefore , we can find representatives for @xmath7 preserving the volume . by invariance",
    ", this defines a vertical nondegenerate _ closed _",
    "form @xmath9 on the preimage of a neighborhood of the basic loops .",
    "the complement is a disc and the boundary is isomorphic in a standard way ( by the existence of a section ) to @xmath10 .",
    "the monodromy diffeomorphism on the fiber is isotopic to the identity",
    ". we can choose the isotopy to be volume - preserving .",
    "this defines a closed 2-form @xmath11 and a closed 2-form @xmath12 ( here @xmath13 is a 2-form on the base @xmath1 and @xmath14 is an arbitrary nonzero constant ) .",
    "the form @xmath15 defines the symplectic structure on the fibration @xmath3 .",
    "the proof gives a recipe how to construct symplectic fibrations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "any relation in the mapping class group @xmath16 of the form @xmath17 = 1\\ ] ] defines a symplectic fibration of the above type over a riemann surface @xmath1 .",
    "we will need standard extensions of the mapping class group @xmath16 .",

    "we can compute the squares of these sections by considering the product @xmath25 $ ] ( where @xmath26 is an arbitrary lifting of @xmath19 into @xmath27 ) ; it is an element of the center of @xmath21 and thus a vector @xmath28 .",

    "the restriction of the intersection form to the sections @xmath24 is positive , contradicting hyperbolicity .",
    "surfaces of such type can also be obtained from complex kodaira fibrations by reversing the orientation .",
    "then the smooth complex curves which have negative normal bundle are turned into curves with positive self - intersection .",
