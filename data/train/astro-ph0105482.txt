    "the elliptical galaxy ncg  5128 is the stellar body of the giant double radio source centaurus  a ( cen  a ) . with a distance of only 3  4 mpc @xcite ,",
    "cen  a is the nearest active galaxy .",
    "it contains an active nucleus ( agn ) and a jet with a large inclination ( @xmath0 ) to the line - of - sight which is detected in all wavelength bands where the spatial resolution is sufficient .",
    "cen  a belongs to the fanaroff - riley type i galaxies and is often also classified as a seyfert 2 .",
    "+ its proximity makes cen  a uniquely observable among such objects and it is a very well studied and frequently observed galaxy in all wavelength bands .",
    "its emission is detected from radio to high - energy gamma - rays @xcite making it the only radio galaxy detected in mev gamma - rays .",
    "all other agn detected in mev gamma - rays ( and identified ) are blazars @xcite where the jet is aligned almost parallel to our line - of - sight .",
    "because cen  a is seen under a much larger angle , it may be a representataive of the many other `` normal '' active galaxies which are just too far away to be detected with present day instruments sensitive in gamma rays .",
    "+ to study the global spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of cen  a over all available frequencies ( energies ) gives insight into the emission processes in agn and may even provide hints to the source of the cosmic diffuse background at gamma - ray energies .",
    "all available data have been combined into fig .",
    "1 . about 40 % of the data ( 122 data points as of march 2001 ) are from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) @xcite .",
    "this data base is rather complete up to about @xmath1 hz ( 4 kev ( einstein data ) ) , but lacks all high energy observations .",
    "thus all available data from the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) taken during its more than 9 years of operation and very - high - energy ( vhe ) observations summarized by @xcite have been added to the data set so that almost 300 data points are now available .",
    "because cen  a is so close , the galaxy can be resolved into the nucleus and the outer regions , including the jet , with many of the instruments used . however , especially the instruments observing in the gamma - ray regime lack this resolution ( osse several degrees , comptel few degrees , egret half degree ; all on board cgro ) .",
    "many authors , however , assume that the high energy emission observed can only originate in the nucleus and that emission from the jet is not visible if the object is viewed far from the jet axis ( as is the case in cen  a with a viewing angle of @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , other than in cases where the spatial resolution of the observations was unknown , the cgro data are included in the plots of the nuclear data , but they are marked differenly .",
    "centaurus a is known to be a highly variable object in all wavelength bands and to show distict emission states @xcite therefore it is very important to measure complete seds simultaneous at a given time and in the different emission states .",
    "this is mandatory to avoid confusion in the interpretation of the data and difficulties when models are fitted to the data .",
    "however , simultaneous multiwavelength observations covering a large interval in frequencies have so far only been organized once in 1995 @xcite when cen a was observed in a low emission state .",
    "all other data have been taken at random times . +",
    "a problem related to the variability is the fact , that especially observations with low sensitivity instruments require very often long integration times , which are much longer than the typical time scales for the cen  a variability .",
    "gamma - ray measurements by the instruments on board cgro lasted typically several weeks , whereas cen  a is known to be variable in the adjacent hard x - ray band on time scales of less than a day .",
    "to help to draw conclusions from this large collection of data ( fig .",
    "1 ) in a reasonable manner , the data have been separated into the following groups :    * according to spatial resolution : * * spatial resolution unknown * * spatial resolution not sufficient to resolve cen a * * spatial resolution sufficient to observe the nucleus alone or if it is reasonably assumed that the emission is from the nucleus only ( fig .",
    "2 ) * simultaneous observations : * * observations without exact date or averages of many observations * * simultaneous observations ( including `` long '' observations of low sensitivity instruments as e.g. the gamma - ray instruments on board cgro ) ( fig .",
    "2 )    due to the limited information available on some of the data , an analysis of the original papers reporting the observations is necessary and will be conducted in the future .",
    "1 , the global structure of the spectral energy distribution of cen  a shows the typical two `` bumps '' which are usually ( for blazars see e.g. @xcite ) attributed to synchrotron emission and compton - scattering for the low frequency ( here : @xmath2 hz ) and high frequency peak ( here : @xmath3 hz ) respectively .",
    "possibly there are two more `` bumps '' at very low and very high frequencies .",
    "however at low frequencies , this impression may be caused by the scatter of the data points . the simultaneous observations in 1995 ( see fig . 2 ) do not support the presence of a `` bump '' at lower frequencies . on the high frequency side of the sed ,",
    "the two detections of cen  a at @xmath4 hz have been questioned and await confirmation from instruments available soon with much more sensitivity .",
    "as one can see from the figures , despite the huge amount of data , only few data sets end up in the most interesting figure 2 .",
    "this shows dramatically the lack of coordinated simultaneus observations , an omission which hardly can be corrected , as the compton gamma - ray observatory , which covered a very important spectral region with its four instruments and which contributed many important measurements , was eliminated before further scheduled coordinated observations had taken place .",
    "no near - term future gamma - ray instrument will be able to close this gap in energy and in observational data .",
    "i thank r.c . hartman and f.w .",
    "stecker for pointing out an error which i made in the plots of the egret data in the first version of the paper .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",

    "<S> due to its proximity and its importance for the understanding of active galaxies and their active nuclei ( agn ) , centaurus a has been observed frequently within the last 150 years in all accessible wavelength bands . </S>",
    "<S> thus a wealth of data exists which has been compiled into the `` nasa extragalactic database '' ( ned ) . </S>",
    "<S> missing from this compilation are to date almost completely the results of recent high energy observations as e.g. obtained by the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of those recent high energy results with all other observations in the ned enables us for the first time to establish the important spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of this closest agn in different emission states . </S>",
    "<S> the combined data have been analyzed to produce seds which are from contemporaneous data and in addition an attempt was made to derive seds which are spatially resolved , i.e. seds from observations which can resolve nucleus and jet in cen a are treated separately . </S>"
