    "it was shown , since the early days of graphene research , that other layered materials can be exfoliated by micromechanical cleavage , following exactly the same procedure used to isolate graphene from graphite , giving birth , in this way , to new two - dimensional crystals , which will trigger , with certainty , new scientific investigations .",
    "@xcite among these new materials there are several dichalcogenides , complex oxides , and boron nitride .",
    "it was also shown that these new two - dimensional forms of condensed matter show high crystal quality and macroscopic continuity .",
    "@xcite    this new world of two - dimensional crystals is still much unexplored , both in what concerns the fundamental properties of these systems and their potential applications .",
    "chief among these two - dimensional crystals , and excluding graphene for obvious reasons , boron nitride is emerging as a system which is finding applications as a scaffold for graphene in electronic devices .",
    "the fact that boron nitride is an insulator , having a large energy gap ( @xmath0 ev ) , together with its high degree of purity makes it a perfect membrane to isolate graphene from the imperfect gate dielectrics used so far . since both systems ,",
    "that is , graphene and boron nitride , interact weakly , two - dimensional crystals of the latter can be used as a buffer layer between a substrate and graphene , leaving its intrinsic electronic properties unafected by disorder associated with the dielectric surface . as a consequence , large electronic mobilities , of the same order of magnitude of those found in suspended graphene samples ,",
    "have been measured in graphene on top of boron nitride .",
    "@xcite graphene devices on hexagonal bn ( @xmath1-bn ) have been shown to exhibit enhanced mobility , reduced carrier inhomogeneity , and reduced intrinsic doping , in comparison with graphene laying directly on top sio@xmath2.@xcite additionally , this new experimental setup allowed the measurement of the fractional quantum hall effect using the four probes geometry , exposing a buried panoply of fractional filling factors , still waiting for deep fundamental justification .",
    "other applications of bn can be envisioned , ranging from spacers to tunneling barriers .    since these first applications of bn in fundamental research that the interest in single layer boron nitride ( sbn ) has been increasing steadily . in the recent past several experimental studies",
    "have been performed , @xcite including tem@xcite and afm@xcite characterization of the material s surface , optical and raman@xcite spectroscopy , and intentional damage sbn s surface.@xcite the main experimental approaches for producing sbn have been both mechanical@xcite and chemical@xcite exfoliation .",
    "others chemical methods are also available now.@xcite in addition to the discovery that sbn is an excellent substrate for graphene electronic devices , @xcite the fabrication of large area ( several @xmath3 ) bn layers,@xcite opens the possibility of mass production of this new two dimensional material , at the time of writing quite an expensive one .",
    "in parallel to the experimental investigations , some theoretical studies on sbn and bilayer boron nitride ( bbn ) have been performed ; topsakal _ _ et al.__@xcite made a density functional theory ( dft ) study of the electronic , magnetic , and elastic properties of sbn and boron nitride nanoribbons .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite studied graphene on the top of @xmath1-bn by dft .",
    "these authors concluded that graphene opens a small gap for three orientations of graphene on the top of @xmath1-bn , and that the most stable orientation was an ab stacking with the carbon atoms on the top of the boron atoms . following the investigations by giovannetti _",
    "et al . _ , sawiska _ _ et al.__@xcite studied graphene ab stacking on a sbn , using both tight - binding ( tb ) and dft .",
    "they confirmed the opening of the gap and fitted the tb parameters to the dft calculations .",
    "the difficulty with the aforementioned calculations is the fact that they assume graphene and sbn unit cells of the same size and perfectly oriented .",
    "we note in passing that the opening of a gap in graphene s spectrum , when this material is laying on top of sbn , has been speculated to exist in the past and the transport properties of graphene under these conditions have been computed .",
    "@xcite    despite the above theoretical studies , it is however experimentally known that graphene on the top of sbn has in general a random crystallographic orientation , that is , there is no preferential orientation of graphene s lattice relatively to that of sbn .",
    "@xcite in addition , no energy gap in graphene s spectrum has been measured so far .",
    "@xcite    marom _ _ et al.__@xcite studied the interlayer sliding of one layer of bn on the top of another layer of bn using dft with van der walls corrections .",
    "they found that the lower energy configurations ( aa@xmath4 and ab ) of bbn differ in energy by an amount smaller than the accuracy limits of their calculations .    in this paper we investigate the structural nature of the ground state of boron nitride bilayers using density functional theory .",
    "we consider the different possible stacking of the individual bn planes , compute their energy ground states and band structures , and fit the tb hopping parameters and on - site energies to the dft results .",
    "graphene bilayer can have two types of stacking : aa and ab ( bernal stacking ) , with the ab structure being the most stable one .",
    "bn bilayers have richer structural possibilities ; given that there are two types of atoms , there are five possible bilayer stacking : two aa and three ab .",
    "experiments show that both types of stacking exist when one considers multilayer bn.@xcite it is then important to clarify what can be expected in what concerns the energetic stability of the different stacking when one takes a bilayer as an isolated system .",
    "since we have in mind possible applications where both graphene and boron nitride two - dimensional crystals are brought into close contact with each other , we will be most interested in the energy bands due to the hybridization of the @xmath5 orbitals alone , the so called @xmath6bands .",
    "the @xmath6bands of bn can then be studied using an empirical tight - binding approach .",
    "the goal is simple : using dft methods we will parametrize the tight - binding hopping and onsite energies of boron nitride layers , which can latter be used for microscopic calculations , such as tunneling properties .     and @xmath7 sublattices , the unit cell , and the primitive vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is equivalent to assume that boron or nitrogen is on the @xmath10 or on the @xmath7 sublattice . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell ] we represent the unit cell of a single layer of boron nitride with the primitive vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 , both of length @xmath11 .",
    "the minimal tight binding model for a sbn has three parameters only : the hopping @xmath12 among nearest neighbor atoms and the onsite energies at the boron and the nitrogen atoms ( in fact , one of these two onsite energies can be taken as a reference energy , and one ends up with two fitting parameters only ) . according to this simple model , the hamiltonian for the electrons in the @xmath6bands of sbn can be written as @xmath13\\ , , \\label{eq_tbh}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the energy at the boron site , @xmath15 is the energy at the nitrogen site , and @xmath16 the wave vector in the brillouin zone is written as @xmath17 and the eigenvalues of hamiltonian ( [ eq_tbh ] ) are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy in the middle of the gap and @xmath20 is the energy gap .",
    "@xcite    using the above defined tight binding model one has three parameters that one needs to adjust : the hopping parameter @xmath12 , the band gap @xmath21 , and the middle gap energy @xmath22 , which can conveniently be chosen to be zero .",
    "these parameters can be found by adjusting eq .",
    "( [ eq : tb ] ) to the band structure of sbn computed from first principles .    for bilayer boron nitride ,",
    "our minimal model includes , in addition to the one given above , an interlayer hopping parameter @xmath23 between the two atoms that are directly on top of each other . hopping between atoms located at larger distances can be added to the model , at the expenses of having more fitting parameters . if one wants to fit accurately at the same time the valence and the conduction bands , adding these extra hoppings",
    "is strictly necessary .",
    "however , it is known that conduction bands in insulators are not well described by dft calculations and thus we have found not to be necessary to go beyond this minimal model",
    ".    five different structures of bn bilayers can exist in principle , assuming that either the atoms are located exactly on top of each other or at the center of the hexagons ( we are excluding , for example , twisted bilayers@xcite ) ; the five structures are represented in fig .",

[",
    "fig : bilayers ] ) differ on what type of atoms are superimposed : in the aa case , atoms of the same type are superimposed , while in the aa@xmath4 case the boron atoms are on top of the nitrogen atoms and vice - versa . the a@xmath4b stacking has the nitrogen atoms superimposed on the two layers and a boron atom at the center of the hexagon , while ab@xmath4 stacking has the boron atoms superimposed on the two layers and a nitrogen atom at the center of the hexagon .",
    "the ab stacking has atoms of different types superimposed on the two layers and a boron atom at the center of the hexagon in one of the layers , while on the other layer is a nitrogen atom that is at the center of the hexagon .",
    "the differences among these fives possibilities should be clear from a close inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayers ] .    for boron nitride bilayers",
    "one finds that only two different hamiltonians need to be written , since they describe all the five possible stacking ( see fig . [",

    "for the hamiltonian ( [ eq_h_ab ] ) we have to consider two different cases .",

    ", @xmath21 is not the energy gap , although it has the same definition as in the monolayer ( see above ) .",
    "having described the tb model for bbn , it is necessary to perform first principle calculations in order to determine the bands of these systems .",
    "once this is done the tb bands are fit to the _ ab - initio _ results and the tb parameters defined above are extracted .",
    "the density functional theory calculations were performed with an _ ab - initio _ spin - density functional code ( aimpro).@xcite we have used the gga in the scheme of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof.@xcite lower states ( core states ) were accounted for by using the dual - space separable pseudopotentials by hartwigsen , goedecker and hutter.@xcite the valence states are expanded over a set of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43like localized cartesian - gaussian bloch atom - centered functions . in the framework of dft calculations ,",
    "the brillouin - zone ( bz ) was sampled for integrations according to the scheme proposed by monkhorst - pack.@xcite the @xmath44-point sampling was @xmath45 and both the atoms and the unit cell parameter were relaxed iteratively in order to find the equilibrium positions and size of the primitive cell .",
    "a supercell with hexagonal symmetry was used ; the parameter @xmath11 was varied to find the equilibrium lattice constant , while the @xmath46 parameter was kept at 60  a.u .",
    "boron nitride monolayers have very different electronic properties from those of graphene , since the broken symmetry of the @xmath10 and @xmath7 sub - lattices necessarily precluded the existence of dirac cones at the corners of the brillouin zone , creating a large band gap ( larger than 5 ev ) in the bn band structure.@xcite except for this vital difference , the rest of the electronic band structure of sbn resembles that found for graphene .",
    "the gap is at the @xmath47-point and not at the @xmath48-point ( as in usual semiconductors ) and , except for that particular zone in * k*-space , the shape of the bands of bn is similar to that of graphene bands .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell_band ] , where the band structure of the boron nitride single layer is shown superimposed on the band structure of graphene for comparison .",
    "the lattice parameter we have obtained for bn is @xmath49   , in good agreement with the value measured experimentally,@xcite and for graphene we have found @xmath50   , giving a lattice mismatch of the order of 2% between the lengths of the primitive vectors of both crystal structures .",
    "the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tb ] ) were adjusted to the @xmath52 orbitals of the valence band only , since dft is more accurate for occupied states .",

    "[ fig : tb_adjust ] .",
    "the fitting to the valence band is excellent , but the resulting parameters do not give a perfect fit to the conduction band , although the tb conduction band does follow the same trend as that obtained from the _ ab - initio _ calculation , as it should be . given that dft calculations results in conduction and valence @xmath6bands that are not particle - hole symmetric ( for example , one has the width of the conduction band greater than that of the valence band ) , and that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tb ] ) , by construction , preserves that symmetry , the tight binding model considering only a nearest neighbor hopping parameter will never fit both bands at the same time .",
    "the tight - binding parameters obtained from fitting the _ ab - initio _ bands are @xmath55  ev and @xmath56  ev , and the best fit is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : tb_adjust ] ) .",
    "the number we have obtained for @xmath12 is different from the one ( @xmath12=2.79  ev ) obtained in ref . and also from that obtained by the same group in a more recent work ( @xmath12=2.28  ev).@xcite in these two works",
    "the fitting was done only near de @xmath54-point , and considering both valence and conduction bands , which is , most likely , the reason for the discrepancy between ours and the latter result@xcite by those authors . we note that in their most recent work@xcite those authors have found a value for @xmath12 closer to the one we are reporting here .",
    "our result for @xmath12 also agrees very well with the one we have obtained for the bbn ( see table [ tab : fit_bilayer ] ) ; this is an important consistency check for our calculations .",
    "we now turn to the study of the electronic spectrum of boron nitride bilayers . in our dft calculations",
    "the primitive vector length @xmath11 was let to relax for all stackings and its final value was found to be @xmath57   for all the cases represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayers ] ; the area of primitive cell size remains essentially unchanged for the five types of stacking considered here .",
    "the situation is different in what concerns interlayer distances , as expected .",
    "table [ tab : d ] summarizes the results : if different types of atoms are superimposed , the two planes are closer than if the atoms are of the same type , since the chemical bonds of the type boron - nitrogen are preferred ( leading to lower energy states ) , whereas boron - boron and nitrogen - nitrogen bonds are not .",
    "the two most stable stackings ( aa@xmath4 and ab ) have the same interplane distance .",

    "the @xmath52 valence and conduction bands are degenerated at the @xmath54-point for the aa@xmath4 bilayer . for the ab stacking ,",
    "there is a slight energy difference ( at the @xmath54-point ) between the two @xmath6valence and conduction bands , and therefore no degeneracy is observed .",
    "for the a@xmath4b bilayer the @xmath6conduction bands are degenerated at the @xmath54-point , whereas for the ab@xmath4 bilayer the degeneracy occurs for the @xmath6valence bands .",
    "it can then be concluded that when a boron atom is on the top of another of the same species , the @xmath6valence bands are degenerate at the @xmath54-point , whereas when a nitrogen atom is on the top of another of the same kind , the reverse happens and it is the @xmath6conduction bands that are degenerate .",
    "it then comes with no surprise that for the aa@xmath4 bilayer both the conduction and valence bands are degenerate , while for the aa bilayer they are not ( these bands are not shown since they refer to the bilayer with ( by far ) the highest ground state energy when compared to the most stable bilayer ) .    the electron density is higher around the nitrogen atoms than near the boron atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_ab ] ) , which results in a larger distance between the two planes of the bilayer for the a@xmath4b case .",
    "the @xmath23 values shown in table [ tab : fit_bilayer ] reflect the distance between the layers , @xmath59  for a@xmath4b and @xmath60  for ab@xmath4 , leading to @xmath61  and @xmath62  , respectively .",
    "when different types of atoms sit on the top of each other , the aligned case aa@xmath4 , with two pairs of atoms superimposed has a smaller @xmath23 than the ab case , which is consistent with the lower energy of the latter .    *",

    "fitting a minimal tight binding to the dft band structure the parameters of the empirical model were determined .",
    "the main features of the _ ab - initio _ bands are well described by our minimal model .",
    "the two most stable bilayer stackings were found to be very close in energy , suggesting that the system can occur in nature in both structures . since",
