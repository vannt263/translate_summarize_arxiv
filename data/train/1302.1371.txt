    "in the last years , increasing attention has been given to the search for quasar pairs ( i.e. , two quasars close in the sky and with almost the same redshift ) in order to assess the role of galaxy interactions in quasar ignition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . however , the discovery of these systems is challenging .",
    "even the large spectroscopic quasar catalogue of @xcite which holds more than @xmath4 objects from the 7th data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contains 22 quasars with angular separation @xmath5 , and only 12 with @xmath6 .",
    "this arises mainly as an effect due to the so  called fiber collision limit : the finite size of the fiber plugs prevents the collection of spectra of more than one object with separation below @xmath7 within the same sdss plate @xcite .    in order to increase the number of known small separation pairs",
    ", we have scrutinised the 13@xmath0 edition of the vron - cetty & vron quasar catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , vcv10 ) , where the effects of the fiber collision limits should be mitigated by the inhomogeneous origin of the listed sources . in this paper",
    "we present compelling evidences that one of the discovered systems : sdss  j15244 + 3032 and rxs  j15244 + 3032 with @xmath8 is instead a quasar  star pair .    throughout this paper",
    "we consider a concordance cosmology with h@xmath9km / s / mpc , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "with the aim of discovering new close physical pairs of quasars we investigated the vcv10 catalogue which contains more than @xmath12 quasars with known redshifts .",
    "we found 58 pairs of quasars with projected separation @xmath13  kpc ( at the redshift of the nearer quasar ) , 28 of which are physical pairs ( i.e. have line  of  sight velocity difference @xmath14km / s , see * ? ? ? * ) and thus are well suited to the study of interacting systems .",
    "in fact the explored projected scales ( @xmath15  kpc ) are those where the quasar activity is expected to be triggered by dissipative interaction events , and the probability that they are due to chance superpositions is rather low @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the lower redshift systems , for which ground based data allow direct investigation of the effects of mutual interaction and of the galactic environment on triggering the quasar activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to confirm the quasar association and to measure the relative systemic velocities from [ oiii ] lines ( see  [ sec:3.2 ] ) we observed with the @xmath16 m asiago telescope the two quasars sdss  j15244 + 3032 ( hereafter j1524q ) and rxs  j15244 + 3032 ( hereafter j1524s ) , the nearest pair we have found ( see figure  [ fig : field ] ) .",
    "located at @xmath17 from j1524q ]    in the vcv10 catalogue , it appears as a system of two bright radio quiet quasars separated in the sky by @xmath18 with redshift @xmath19 for j1524q @xcite and @xmath20 for j1524s @xcite .",
    "the two sources were detected in ir by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with magnitudes : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for j1524q , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for j1524s .",
    "a source is present in the rosat all  sky survey bright source catalogue @xcite at ra=15:24:28.6 , dec=+30:32:35 .",
    "both j1524q and j1524s are within the positional error of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 from j1524q and @xmath29 j1524s ) .",
    "it is worth noting the presence of a galaxy at redshift ( ra=15:24:30,dec=+30:32:24.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ fig : field ] ) located at @xmath17 from the quasar j1524q .",
    "the corresponding projected separations of @xmath30kpc makes j1524q a viable candidate to investigate the absorption features that the gaseous halos of the galaxy imprint on its spectra ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most prominent metal features are located in the near uv , for instance the mgii doublet and the mgi line are shifted at 2974  and at 3031 , respectively .",
    "thus future observations with instruments like hubble space telescope spectrographs stis and cos , could increase the small number of metal absorption systems known at redshift @xmath31 , where exquisite details of the galaxy population have been recorded ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "j1524q and j1524s were observed with the @xmath16 m asiago telescope located at the cima ekar observatory on 20th april 2010 .",
    "data were gathered with the asiago faint object spectrograph and camera ( afosc ) mounted in long  slit spectroscopy configuration with grism # 4 and @xmath32 slit in the wavelength range from @xmath33  to @xmath34 .",
    "this yields a spectral resolution of @xmath35 .",
    "the targets are rather bright , thus the exposure time of 1800s ( splitted into 3 exposures of 600s each ) with a seeing of @xmath36 achieved an average signal  to  noise ratio per pixel of @xmath37 .",
    "the position angle of the slit was oriented so that the spectrum of the two objects could be acquired simultaneously ( see figure  [ fig : field ] ) .",
    "standard ` iraf ` tools were adopted in the data reduction .",
    "bias subtraction , flat field correction , image alignment and combination were performed with the ` ccdred ` package .",
    "cosmic rays were cleaned by combining different exposures with the ` crreject ` algorithm .",

    "we can argue that , although the finding chart published by @xcite seems to point to j1524s , the authors have probably switched the two sources , and the x  ray emission observed by rosat was indeed associated with j1524q .",
    "this is also supported by the lack of other sources within @xmath46 from j1524s that have colour consistent with those of a quasar at @xmath47 .",
    "it is well known that the different quasar emission lines can lead to redshift that differ by up to 1000km / s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most reliable estimate of the systemic redshift ( @xmath48 ) comes from narrow forbidden lines , the most prominent of which are the [ oiii ] doublet at @xmath49  and @xmath50   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by measuring the position of the [ oiii]@xmath51 line in our spectrum of j1524q",
    ", we obtain @xmath52 ( see table  [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "this agrees to 200km / s with the systemic redshift inferred from the sdss spectrum by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath53 ) .",
    "the two redshift estimates are therefore marginally consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "this value contrasts with the redshift presented by zhao et al .",
    "( @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , since the authors did not publish any indication on the uncertainty associated with their measure , we are not able to directly compare the two estimates .",
    "in order to probe the physical association of the alleged low redshift quasar pair j1524qs present in the vcv10 catalogue , we have observed the two sources with the asiago telescope .",
    "the optical spectrum of j1524s shows a number of absorption features typical of a g spectral type star , ruling out the quasar classification proposed by @xcite for this object .",
    "it is worth noting that some other similar reclassification of alleged quasars in the vron - cetty & vron catalogues are present in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover @xcite shows that @xmath54 quasars listed in the catalogue have erroneous astrometry by more than @xmath55 or are incorrect duplication of the same objects .",
    "this suggests that , for the study of binary systems , one must take special care when considering the classification , the position , and the redshift of the sources listed in this catalogue , especially when no spectrum is publicly available .",
