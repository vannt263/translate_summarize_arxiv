    "the @xmath0 meson has been observed by the cdf and d0 groups in different channels @xcite .",
    "the semileptonic decays of @xmath0 was studied in ref .  @xcite using the bsw(bauer , stech , wirbel ) model @xcite and the igsw(isgur , grinstein , scora , wise ) model @xcite , and in the frame work of the bethe - salpeter equation in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the relativistic constituent quark model in ref .",
    "@xcite . alongside the small differences in the partial decay widths in these models",
    ", the first estimates made on the basis of the three points ( 3p ) qcd sum rules ( sr ) @xcite are significant smaller .",
    "the reason was supposed to be the valuable role of coulomb corrections , which implied the summation of @xmath3 corrections significant in the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the discrepancy observed between the qcd sum rules and the quark models can be eliminated by including these higher qcd corrections .",
    "however , the 3psr inherits some problems when describing heavy - to - light transitions , the main one being that some of the form factors have a nasty behavior in the heavy quark limit @xcite .",
    "the reason is , when almost the whole momentum is carried by one of the constituents , the distribution amplitude of the final meson can be described by the short - distance expansion . moreover",
    ", the calculation for the form factors is valid only at the point @xmath4 , and a pole approximation has to be employed to study the semileptonic decays .",
    "these limit the applicability of qcd sum rules based on the short - distance expansion of a three - point correlation function to heavy - to - light transitions and calls for an expansion around the light - cone , as realized in the light - cone sum rule approach . in this paper",
    "we will try to study the semileptonic decays of the @xmath0 meson in this approach and compare the results with the traditional sum rule approach .",
    "the semileptonic decays of the @xmath0 meson involve the transition @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . for the case of @xmath0 decaying into a pseudoscalar meson , to twist-3 accuracy only the leading twist distribution amplitude ( da )",
    "is involved if we start from a chiral current .",
    "if we choose a suitable chiral current in the vector meson case , the main twist-3 contributions are also eliminated and we can consider the leading twist contribution only .",
    "the result depends on the corresponding distribution amplitude ( da ) of the final meson .",
    "we have to construct realistic models for describing the heavy quarkonium and other heavy mesons .",
    "in particular , the behavior of @xmath13 and @xmath6 da s is an interesting subject by the belle result for the cross section @xmath14 .",
    "hence we pay more attention to discussing the heavy quarkonium da .",
    "we calculate the cross section @xmath14 by employing our charmonium distribution amplitude and the result is consistent with the experiment data . based on a phenomenological model for the leading twist da",
    ", we calculate the form factors for various @xmath0 decay modes in the corresponding regions",
    ". then we extrapolate the form factors to the whole kinetic regions , and get the decay widths and branching ratios for various @xmath0 decay modes including their @xmath2 modes when they are kinematically accessible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section we derive the lcsrs for the form factors for various @xmath0 decay modes .",
    "a discussion of the da models for charmonium and other heavy mesons is given in section iii .",
