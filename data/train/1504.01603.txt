    "the idea that grbs can serve as the sources of high energy neutrinos has long been discussed @xcite . before breaking out , a relativistic jet punctures through the stellar envelope and transports energy to electrons and protons via shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "accelerated electrons dominate radiation by synchrotron or inverse compton mechanism while accelerated protons produce neutrinos by proton - proton collision and photopion process @xcite .",
    "this neutrino signal is prior to the main burst , as a precursor .",
    "however , it has been argued that this high energy neutrino precursor of energy ranging from @xmath7 up to @xmath4 can not be produced for a typical grb @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the reverse shock occurring at the interface of the jet head would be radiation mediated , resulting in an inefficient shock acceleration .",
    "nevertheless , a matter is different for ll - grbs @xcite . due to its low power ,",
    "the thomson optical depth is low even inside a star so that efficient shock acceleration would be expected .",
    "we assume the same ll - grb as our previous work @xcite , in which we have shown that our ll - grb is responsible for @xmath3 neutrinos .",
    "further in this paper we focus on the oscillation properties of these high energy neutrinos .",
    "neutrino oscillation in matter has been studied for a long while .",
    "the resonant conversion of neutrinos from one flavor to another with matter effect was first discussed in solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "while propagating in a medium , @xmath8 interacts via neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) , whereas @xmath9 and @xmath10 interacts only via nc .",
    "this mechanism is called the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite .",
    "as we know , solar neutrinos are relative low in energy ( @xmath11 ) , as is the same for supernova neutrinos , of which the research is becoming more and more attractive @xcite . in the meantime ,",
    "osillation of grb neutrinos is yet less understood . with energy up to @xmath4 ,",
    "the oscillation properties of grb neutrinos are different compared to @xmath12 neutrinos .",
    "@xcite discussed the electromagnetic and adiabatic energy losses of @xmath13s and @xmath14s which would modify the flavor ratio produced by grbs and concluded that the flavor ratio on earth @xmath15 is @xmath16 at low energy to @xmath17 at high energy with a transition energy around @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite discussed high - energy neutrinos produced in optically thick astrophysical objects in the energy range @xmath19 .",
    "they studied in detail the shower - to - muon track ratio @xmath20 and discussed its variation with source properties and neutrino oscillation parameters . @xcite also presented a detailed and comprehensive study of flavor conversion of neutrinos from hidden sources ( jets ) but their results differ from the results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the resonant oscillation could take place within the inner high density region of the choked jet progenitor and the final flavor ratio detected on earth is further modified to either @xmath21 for the large mixing angle solution to the solar neutrino data , or @xmath22 for maximal mixing among the muon and tau neutrinos in vacuum .",
    "@xcite studied the three flavor neutrino oscillation of choked grbs in gev - tev energy range for three different presupernova star models .",
    "they found that for neutrino energies below @xmath23 the flux ratio did not amount to @xmath16 , whereas for higher energy neutrinos it did .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out an analysis of resonance conditions for @xmath24 neutrinos created in internal shocks at different places in the star , estimating the flavor ratios on earth .",
    "the main difference of our paper with previous works is at the starting point that we take a ll - grb as the source of high energy neutrinos and hence we focus on higher energy from @xmath7 to @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the mixing angles in matter for @xmath4 neutrinos are close to zero so the transition probabilities from one flavor to another are almost invariant , which are different with @xmath25 neutrinos .",
    "thus we get a constant ratio of @xmath6 for @xmath26 neutrinos on earth .",
    "moreover , we discuss the dependence of the flavor ratio on the index @xmath2 and neutrino energy , providing a promising way to probe the grb progenitor structure through a neutrino precursor signal in the future .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we present all results in section 2 .",
    "subsection 2.1 is about the density profile of the envelope and subsection 2.2 is about adiabatic violation for neutrinos above @xmath27 . in subsection 2.3",
    "we discuss the three neutrino mixing both in the envelope and in vacuum , and then the dependence on envelope density profile index is exhibited in subsection 2.4 .",
    "we finish with discussions and conclusions in section 3 .",
    "in this subsection , we take @xmath28 as our premise , and discuss the dependence on @xmath2 later in subsection 2.4 .    we assume a power - law envelope density profile @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath20 being the mass and radius of the helium envelope . for a helium core of mass @xmath33 and radius @xmath34 cm ,",
    "the ambient envelope density can be expressed as @xmath35 .",
    "the number density of electrons in the envelope is @xmath36 , where the number of electrons per nucleon @xmath37 needs to be obtained .",
    "the saha s equation reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 stand for the number density , partition function and ionization energy of @xmath41 ionization ions , respectively .",
    "@xmath42 is the temperature and @xmath43 is the electron pressure . for our pure helium envelope",
    ", we can get @xmath44 if we adopt typical values as @xmath45 .",
    "we can see that the 2nd ionization of helium is negligible so that @xmath46 .",
    "the effective potential of neutrinos can be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "before we start to consider the neutrino oscillation , we need to check whether the adiabatic approximation is valid .",
    "the adiabatic parameter @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass square difference between the neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath52 is the neutrino energy and @xmath53 is the mixing angle .",
    "the subscript @xmath54 represents the place at which resonance happens .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath49 is in proportion to @xmath55 and the adiabatic approximation requirement @xmath56 is usually fulfilled for neutrinos with relative low energy of @xmath57 , such as solar neutrinos and supernovae neutrinos . however , in this paper we focus on high energy from @xmath27 to @xmath26 and we find that adiabatic conversion is not applicable now .",
    "we plot the adiabatic parameter versus neutrino energy in figure  [ figure 1 ] and it is obvious that @xmath56 is violated for high energy neutrinos . only @xmath58 and @xmath59 are needed because there are at most two level crossing for neutrinos in the three flavor case @xcite .",
    "the vacuum oscillation parameters we adopt are @xmath60 , cp violation phase @xmath61 and normal mass hierarchy is assumed @xcite .",
    "for the reason above , we are obliged to do certain calibration of level crossing effect .",
    "the jumping probability is approximately computed by the wkb method @xcite : @xmath62-\\exp[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\gamma \\frac{f}{\\sin^2\\theta}]}{1-\\exp[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\gamma \\frac{f}{\\sin^2\\theta } ] } ,   \\eqno ( 5)\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is a factor depending on the density profile .",
    "then in figure  [ figure 2 ] we plot @xmath64 and @xmath65 versus neutrino energy , representing the jumping probability from energy eigenstate @xmath66 to @xmath67 and from @xmath66 to @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the evolution equation for neutrinos in matter is given by @xmath69\\psi ,   \\eqno ( 6)\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the flavor eigenstate @xcite .",
    "@xmath72 is the three neutrino mixing matrix , @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "neutrino mixing angles in matter can be expressed as @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76 the effective mixing angles @xmath77 become maximum @xmath78 as resonance conditions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are fulfilled respectively .",
    "we can see that @xmath77 are functions of neutrino energy and radius since @xmath81 .",
    "we plot @xmath82 versus energy at radius @xmath83 in figure  [ fig3:subfig : a ] and find that @xmath84 reaches maximum for @xmath85 neutrinos . here",
    "the radius @xmath86 is treated as the born site of high energy neutrinos .",
    "the reason is that the thomson optical depth is @xmath87 and at @xmath88 we have @xmath89 , thus ensuring the efficient shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "we also plot the effective mixing angles versus energy at progenitor surface @xmath90 in figure  [ fig3:subfig : b ] and how they evolve with propagation distance for @xmath91 neutrinos in figure  [ fig3:subfig : c ] respectively .",
    "in addition , we kindly find that effective mixing angles tend to be constant zero for @xmath26 neutrinos , which is the main reason for constant flavor ratio and will be shown later .    the transition probability from one flavor to another after level crossing calibration can be expressed as @xcite @xmath92@xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are mixing matrix elements in matter .",
    "we plot the nine mutual transition probabilities between three neutrino flavors as functions of neutrino energy at different radii in figure  [ fig4:subfig : a]-  [ fig4:subfig : b ] and the evolution with propagation distance for given energies in figure  [ fig4:subfig : c]-  [ fig4:subfig : d ] .",
    "given an initial flavor ratio @xmath5 , we can plot how the flavor ratio changes with energy and distance when neutrinos are still in the envelope in figure  [ fig5:subfig : a]-  [ fig5:subfig : d ] .",
    "the deviation from @xmath96 at born site @xmath86 is due to level crossing effect for different energies .",
    "we can see the trend that the flavor ratio changes more gently for neutrinos with higher energy . for @xmath26 neutrinos ,",
    "the flavor ratio is almost a constant value @xmath97 in the envelope .",
    "neutrinos go through vacuum oscillation after leaving the progenitor surface and has been well understood .",
    "we can express the transition probability @xmath98 as the first - order expansion of the small parameter @xmath99 @xcite : @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 the flavor ratio on earth is @xmath106 we plot the flavor ratio versus neutrino energy on just leaving the progenitor and on earth in figure  [ fig6:subfig : a]-  [ fig6:subfig : b ] .",
    "we can see clearly that the flavor ratio varies with energy in the range of less than @xmath107 , while the flavor ratio keeps invariant @xmath6 for @xmath26 neutrinos .",
    "it is reasonable to argue that the final neutrino flavor ratio depends on the density profile of the progenitor envelope .",
    "apparently , with the same assumed envelope mass and radius , different values of the power law index lead to different ambient envelope densities , thus effective potentials are different .",
    "this will have an impact on the resonance conditions , effective mixing angles in matter and transition probabilities . in this subsection",
    ", we would like to investigate how large this impact could be .",
    "here we adopt the same helium progenitor but with different power law index @xmath108 .",
    "respectively , we can write them as @xmath109 and @xmath110 and all calculations have been repeated for these two cases .",
    "we present our result in figure  [ figure 7 ] . for simplicity",
    ", we only show the flavor ratio at the surface of the progenitor ( figure  [ fig7:subfig : a ] ) and on earth ( figure  [ fig7:subfig : b ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath2 has an impact on the flavor ratio . at a given radius ,",
    "the resonance conditions are shifted to higher energies for larger @xmath2 .",
    "the lower limit of neutrino energy for constant flavor ratio is highest for @xmath111 , which is several @xmath26 , compared with sub@xmath26 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath28 .",
    "the reason is that the effective potential of neutrinos is lower for a steeper envelope density profile at the same radius , so higher neutrino energies are required to reach resonance conditions .",
    "furthermore , the flavor ratio is evidently different before it reaches constant for the three cases , so that we can use the observed ratio of neutrino energy from @xmath27 to several hundred @xmath114 to probe the stellar structure , provided that we can observe precursor neutrinos of a grb with @xmath115 scale detectors like icecube in the future .",
    "high - energy neutrinos can be produced while the jet is still propagating in the envelope and ll - grbs with typical parameters are responsible for @xmath116 neutrinos .",
    "these neutrinos will oscillate with matter effect in the envelope and go through vacuum oscillation after leaving the progenitor till they arrive at the earth .",
    "we investigate the three - neutrino mixing properties with matter effect and then get an expected flavor ratio on earth , given an initial ratio @xmath5 .",
    "we notice that adiabatic conversion is violated because level crossing effect is non - negligible for such high energy neutrinos .",
    "after calibrating this effect , we get the neutrino mixing angles in matter and nine transition probabilities .",
    "we find that the effective mixing angles tend to be zero for neutrinos on the high energy end ( @xmath117 ) , resulting in constant transition probability and constant flavor ratio .",
    "for @xmath26 neutrinos , we always get @xmath6 on earth .    from our expectations ,",
    "the final neutrino ratio will depend on the density profile parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we take @xmath118 to verify the dependence and the result is clear in figure  [ figure 7 ] .",
    "while the flavor ratio on the high energy end keeps constant , it is evidently different for neutrinos with energy from @xmath27 to several hundred @xmath114 , thus providing a promising way to probe the stellar structure in the future .    in this paper",
    ", we only investigate the high - energy neutrino oscillation of one typical ll - grb for the given parameters . changing these parameters",
    "may have an impact on the flavor ratio - neutrino energy dependence in tev range : at a given radius , the resonance energy may differ and the lower limit of neutrino energy for constant flavor ratio is also different , similar to the features shown in figure  [ figure 7 ] .",
    "however , it does not influence the final flavor ratio of pev neutrinos .",
    "that is because the envelope is always too  dense \" for pev neutrinos , the effective mixing angles of which always tend to be constant zero .",
    "the case is the same when changing envelope temperature @xmath42 . though the number density of electrons varies for different @xmath42 , the effective mixing angles for pev neutrinos are always zero and constant the flavor ratio @xmath6 on earth is still in expectation .",
    "however , this constant value may differ from @xmath119 due to the uncertainties of vacuum oscillation parameters and neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the icecube experiment has recently reported the observation of 37 high - energy ( @xmath120 ) neutrino events , separated into 28 showers and 9 muon tracks , being consistent with an extraterrestrial origin @xcite . to correlate with the observation , we take the hypothesis that all the icecube neutrinos are produced by ll - grbs before jet - breakout .",
    "@xcite claimed that @xmath121 at earth is disfavored at @xmath122 c.l .",
    "with the recently released 3-yr data .",
    "on one hand , neutrino flavor ratio in the detector may be changed by the earth matter effect @xcite . on the other hand , this does not conflict with our conclusion .",
    "we just recommend to do an analysis of observed shower - to - track ratio in different energy bins when doing data reduction since we know that the flavor ratio depends strongly on neutrino energy and an overall @xmath16 ratio does not make any sense .",
    "nevertheless , we expect constant flavor ratio for @xmath26 neutrinos but we have observed only three @xmath26 events now .",
    "so our result is to be verified with a larger dataset of @xmath116 neutrinos of icecube in the future .",
    "if this constant value appears in next few decades , when we would have observed tens of pev neutrino events , we can constrain the structure of ll - grb progenitors and vacuum oscillation parameters by exactly measuring this value . if there is no sign of such a constant ratio ,",
    "the most probable reason is that there exist other dominate pev neutrino sources .",
    "the hypothesis that all observed neutrinos are produced in the jet propagation process of ll - grbs may be not so complete because they may also origin from other cosmic - ray sources like agns or they can be produced in other stages of a grb event such as by internal shocks and external shocks . especially , we hope that one day we could observe the neutrino precursor of a grb event , this neutrino - grb correlation is crucial for our understanding about the structure of the progenitor envelope and the jet propagation dynamics . for a complete comparison with the observation ,",
    "the flavor ratio in tev range of diffuse neutrino background produced by grbs needs to be done and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
