    "then @xmath81 provides a @xmath3-theory class @xmath466\\in k_{0}(c^*(tm))\\simeq k_0(c_0(t^*m))$ ] while @xmath89 provides a @xmath3-theory class @xmath1470\\in k_0(c^*({\\mathcal{g}}^t_m))$ ] and : @xmath1471)=[f]\\in k_0(c^*(tm))\\ ] ]    thus : @xmath992\\otimes [ e^m_0]^{-1 } \\otimes [ e^m_1 ] = [ p_1]\\in k_0({\\mathcal{k}})\\ ] ] and @xmath1472 $ ] coincides with @xmath1473 under @xmath1474 .",
    "since @xmath1475 has principal symbol equal to the leading part of @xmath81 , and since every class in @xmath1476 can be obtained from a zero order elliptic symbol , the claim is justified .    to be complete ,",
    "let us explain that the analytical index map is the poincar dual of the homomorphism in @xmath3-homology associated with the obvious map : @xmath1477 .",
    "indeed , thanks to the obvious homomorphism @xmath1478 given by multiplication , @xmath1479 can be lifted into an element @xmath1480 , called the _",
    "dirac element_. this dirac element yields the well known poincar duality between @xmath1481 and @xmath1482 ( @xcite ) , and in particular it gives an isomorphism : @xmath1483 whose inverse is induced by the principal symbol map .",
    "one can then easily show the following proposition :    [ pd - index - smooth ] let @xmath1484 be the projection onto a point .",
    "the following diagram commutes : @xmath1485    * the topological index *    take an embedding @xmath1486 , and let @xmath1487 be the normal bundle of this embedding .",
    "the vector bundle @xmath1488 admits a complex structure , thus we have a thom isomorphism : @xmath1489 given by a @xmath0-equivalence : @xmath1490 @xmath138 is called the _",
    "thom  element _ @xcite .",
    "the bundle @xmath454 identifies with an open neighborhood of @xmath124 into @xmath1307 , so we have the excision map : @xmath1491 consider also : @xmath1492 given by the isomorphism @xmath1493 together with bott periodicity .",
    "the _ topological index map _",
    "@xmath1494 is the composition : @xmath1495    this classical construction can be reformulated with groupoids .",
    "first , let us give a description of @xmath138 , or rather of its inverse , in terms of groupoids .",
    "recall the construction of the thom groupoid .",
    "we begin by pulling back @xmath136 over @xmath454 in the groupoid sense : @xmath1496 @xmath14970,1 ] \\rightrightarrows n\\times [ 0,1].\\ ] ] this _ thom groupoid _ and the morita equivalence between @xmath1498 and @xmath136 provides the @xmath0-element : @xmath1499 this element is defined exactly as @xmath1479 is .",
    "precisely , the evaluation map at @xmath406 , @xmath1500 defines an invertible @xmath0-element .",
    "we let @xmath1501 be the evaluation map at @xmath311 .",
    "the morita equivalence between the groupoids @xmath136 and @xmath1498 leads to a morita equivalence between the corresponding @xmath1-algebra and thus to a @xmath0-equivalence @xmath1502 . then @xmath1503^{-1 } \\otimes [ \\tilde{e}_1 ] \\otimes { \\mathcal{m}}\\ .\\ ] ]    we have the following :    @xcite if @xmath138 is the @xmath0-equivalence giving the thom isomorphism then : @xmath1504    this proposition also applies to interpret the isomorphism @xmath1505    indeed , consider the embedding @xmath1506 .",
    "the normal bundle is just @xmath1507 and we get as before : @xmath1508 using the previous proposition we get : @xmath1509 .",
    "remark also that @xmath1510 so that @xmath1511^{-1}\\otimes[e_{1}^{{\\mathbb r}^{n}}]$ ] .",
    "finally the topological index : @xmath1512 is entirely described using ( deformation ) groupoids .    * the equality of the indices *    a last groupoid is necessary in order to prove the equality of index maps .",
    "namely , this groupoid is obtained by recasting the construction of the thom groupoid at the level of tangent groupoids : @xmath1513})^*}({\\mathcal{g}}_{m})\\times]0 , 1]\\ ] ] as before , this yields a class : @xmath1514 all maps in the following diagram : @xmath1515 are given by kasparov products with :    1 .",
    "classes of homomorphisms coming from restrictions or inclusions between groupoids , 2 .",
    "inverses of such classes , 3 .",
    "explicit morita equivalences .",
    "this easily yields the commutativity of diagram ( [ as - diagram ] ) . having in mind the previous description of index maps using groupoids",
    ", this commutativity property just implies : @xmath1516",
    "as we explained earlier , the proof of the @xmath3-theoretical form of the atiyah - singer presented in these lectures extends very easily to the case of pseudomanifolds with isolated singularities .",
    "this is achieved provided one uses the correct notion of _ tangent space _ of the pseudomanifold and for a pseudomanifold @xmath39 with one conical point ( the case of several isolated singularities is similar ) , this is the noncommutative tangent space defined in section [ ncgtangent ] : @xmath1517 in the sequel , it will replace the ordinary tangent space of a smooth manifold .",
    "moreover , it gives rise to another deformation groupoid which will replace the ordinary tangent groupoid of a smooth manifold : @xmath15180,1 ] \\rightrightarrows { x^{\\circ}}\\times [ 0,1]\\ ] ] we call @xmath253 the _ tangent groupoid _ of @xmath39 .",
    "it can be provided with a smooth structure such that @xmath183 is a smooth subgroupoid .",
    "moreover both are amenable so their reduced and maximal @xmath1-algebras coincide and are nuclear .        using the partition @xmath1519={x^{\\circ}}\\times \\{0\\ }",
    "\\cup { x^{\\circ}}\\times ] 0,1]$ ] into saturated open and closed subsets of the units space of the tangent groupoid , we define the @xmath0-element associated to the tangent groupoid of @xmath39 :        now we can define the analytical index exactly as we did for closed smooth manifolds .",
    "precisely , the _ analytical index _ for @xmath39 is set to be the map : @xmath1523 the interpretation of this map as the fredholm index of an appropriate class of elliptic operators is possible and carried out in @xcite .",
    "pursuing the analogy with smooth manifolds , we explain in this paragraph that the analytical index map for @xmath39 is poincar dual to the index map in @xmath3-homology associated to the obvious map : @xmath1524 .",
    "the algebras @xmath198 and @xmath1525 are isomorphic .",
    "if @xmath351 belongs to @xmath1526 and @xmath81 to @xmath1527 , let @xmath1528 be the element of @xmath1527 defined by @xmath1529 .",
    "this induces a * -morphism @xmath1530 the _ dirac element _ is defined to be @xmath1531\\otimes \\partial_x \\in kk(c(x)\\otimes c^*(t^ { { \\mathsf{s}}}x),{\\mathbb c } ) .\\ ] ] we recall      the explicit construction of @xmath1536 , which is heavy gooing and technical , can be avoided .",
    "in fact , the definitions of @xmath183 , @xmath253 and thus of @xmath1537 , can be extended in a very natural way to the case of an arbitrary pseudomanifold and the proof of poincar duality can be done using a recursive argument on the depth of the stratification , starting with the case depth@xmath1538 , that is with the case of smooth closed manifolds .",
    "this is the subject of @xcite .",
    "the theorem implies that : @xmath1539 is an isomorphism . in @xcite , it is explained how to in interpret its inverse as a principal symbol map , and one also get the analogue of proposition [ pd - index - smooth ] :          * thom isomorphism * take an _ embedding _ @xmath1542 .",
    "this means that we have a map which restricts to an embedding @xmath15430,+\\infty[$ ] in the usual sense and which sends @xmath60 to the image of @xmath1544 in @xmath1545 .",
    "moreover we require the embedding on @xmath2610,1[$ ] to be of the form @xmath1546 where @xmath1547 is an embedding of @xmath159 in @xmath1307 .",
    "such an embedding provides a _",

    "<S> these lecture notes are mainly devoted to a proof using groupoids and @xmath0-theory of atiyah and singer s index theorem on compact smooth manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> we first present an elementary introduction to groupoids , @xmath1-algebras , @xmath0-theory and pseudodifferential calculus on groupoids . </S>",
    "<S> we then show how the point of view adopted here generalizes to the case of conical pseudo - manifolds .    </S>",
    "<S> * introduction *    during this course we intend to give the tools involved in our approach of index theory for singular spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the global framework adopted here is noncommutative geometry , with a particular focus on groupoids , @xmath2-algebras and bivariant @xmath3-theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea to use @xmath2-algebras to study _ spaces _ may be understood with the gelfand theorem which asserts that hausdorff locally compact spaces are in one to one correspondance with commutative @xmath2-algebras .    </S>",
    "<S> a starting point in noncommutative geometry is then to think of noncommutative @xmath2-algebras as corresponding to a wider class of spaces , more singular than hausdorff locally compact spaces .    as a first consequence , </S>",
    "<S> given a geometrical or topological object which is badly behaved with respect to classical tools , noncommutative geometry suggests to define a @xmath2-algebra encoding relevant information carried by the original object .    refining this construction </S>",
    "<S> , one may try to define this @xmath2-algebra as the @xmath2-algebra of a groupoid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , one can try to build a groupoid directly , encoding the original object and regular enough to allow the construction of its @xmath2-algebra . in the ideal case where the groupoid is smooth , one gets much more than a @xmath2-algebra , which only reflects topological properties : the groupoid has a geometrical and analytical flavor enabling many applications .    </S>",
    "<S> an illuminating example is the study of the space of leaves of a foliated manifold @xmath4 @xcite . while this space @xmath5 is usually very singular , the holonomy groupoid of the foliation leads to a @xmath2-algebra @xmath6 replacing with great success the algebra of continuous functions on the space @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the holonomy groupoid is smooth and characterizes the original foliation .    </S>",
    "<S> once a @xmath2-algebra is built for the study of a given problem , one can look for _ invariants _ attached to it . </S>",
    "<S> for ordinary spaces , basic invariants live in the homology or cohomology of the space . when dealing with @xmath2-algebras , the suitable homology theory is @xmath3-theory , or better the @xmath0-theory developped by g. kasparov @xcite ( when a smooth subalgebra of the @xmath2-algebra is specified , which for instance is the case if a smooth groupoid is available , one may also consider cyclic ( co-)homology , but this theory is beyond the scope of these notes ) .    there is a fundamental theory which links the previous ideas , namely index theory . in the 60 s , </S>",
    "<S> m. atiyah and i. singer @xcite showed their famous index theorem . roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , they showed that , given a closed manifold , one can associate to any elliptic operator an integer called the _ </S>",
    "<S> index _ which can be described in two different ways : one purely analytic and the other one purely topological . </S>",
    "<S> this result is stated with the help of @xmath3-theory of spaces . hence using the swan - serre theorem , </S>",
    "<S> it can be formulated with @xmath3-theory of ( commutative ) @xmath2-algebras . this point , and </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the index theorem can be proved in many ways using @xmath3-theoretic methods , leads to the attempt to generalize it to more _ singular _ situations where appropriate @xmath2-algebras are available . in this a way , </S>",
    "<S> noncommutative geometry is a very general framework in which one can try to state and prove index theorems . </S>",
    "<S> the case of foliations illustrates this perfectly again : elliptic operators along the leaves and equivariant with respect to the holonomy groupoid , admit an analytical index living in the @xmath3-theory of the @xmath2-algebra @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover this index can also be described in a topological way and this is the contents of the index theorem for foliations of a. connes and g. skandalis @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a. connes @xcite also observed the important role played by groupoids in the definition of the index map : in both cases of closed manifolds and foliations , the analytical index map can be described with the use of a groupoid , namely a _ </S>",
    "<S> deformation groupoid_. this approach has been extented by the authors and v. nistor @xcite who showed that the topological index of atiyah - singer can also be described using deformation groupoids . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a _ geometrical proof _ of the index theorem of atiyah - singer ; moreover this proof easily apply to a class of singular spaces ( namely , pseudomanifolds with isolated singularities ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the contents of this serie of lectures are divided into three parts . </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly describe them :    * part 1 : groupoids and their @xmath2-algebras . </S>",
    "<S> *    as mentioned earlier , the first problem in the study of a singular geometrical situation is to associate to it a mathematical object which carries the information one wants to study and which is regular enough to be analyzed in a reasonable way . in noncommutative geometry , </S>",
    "<S> answering this question amounts to looking for a good _ groupoid _ and constructing its _ @xmath1-algebra_. these points will be the subject of the first two sections .    * part 2 : @xmath0-theory . *    once the situation is desingularized , say trough the construction of a groupoid and its @xmath2-algebra , one may look for invariants which capture the basic properties . roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , the _ @xmath0-theory _ groups are convenient groups of invariants for @xmath1-algebras and @xmath0-theory comes with powerful tools to carry out computations . </S>",
    "<S> kasparov s </S>",
    "<S> bivariant @xmath3-theory will be the main topic of sections 3 to [ finkk ] .    </S>",
    "<S> * part 3 : index theorems . *    </S>",
    "<S> we first briefly explain in section [ pseudo ] the pseudo - differential calculus on groupoids . </S>",
    "<S> then in section [ debutind ] , we give a geometrical proof of the atiyah singer index theorem for closed manifolds using the language of groupoids and @xmath0-theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show in the last section how these results can be extended to </S>",
    "<S> _ conical pseudo - manifolds_.    * prerequists . * </S>",
    "<S> the reader interested in this course should have background on several domains . </S>",
    "<S> familiarity with basic differential geometry ( manifolds , tangent spaces ) is needed . </S>",
    "<S> the notions of fibre bundle , of @xmath3-theory for locally compact spaces should be known . </S>",
    "<S> basic functional analysis like analysis of linear operators on hilbert spaces should be familiar . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of pseudodifferential calculus ( basic definitions , ellipticity ) is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> altough it is not absolutely necessary , some familiarity with @xmath2-algebras is preferable .    </S>",
    "<S> * acknowledgments * we would like to thank georges skandalis who allowed us to use several of his works to write up this course , in particular the manuscript of one of his courses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to warmly thank jorge plazas for having typewritten a part of this course during the summer school and jrme chabert who carefully read these notes and corrected several mistakes . </S>",
    "<S> we are grateful to all the organizers for their kind invitation to the extremely stimulating summer school held at villa de leyva in july 2007 and we particulary thank sylvie paycha both as an organizer and for her valuable comments on this document .    </S>",
    "<S> this first part will be devoted to the notion of groupoid , specifically that of differentiable groupoid . we provide definitions and consider standard examples . </S>",
    "<S> the interested reader may look for example at @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then recall the definition of @xmath1-algebras and see how one can associate a @xmath1-algebra to a groupoid . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of @xmath1-algebra of groupoid was initiated by jean renault @xcite . </S>",
