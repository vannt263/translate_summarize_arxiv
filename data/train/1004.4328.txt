    "the discovery of superconductivity ( sc ) with critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) up to 55k in iron - arsenide systems @xcite has triggered enormous interest in iron - based superconducting materials . generally , the parent compound undergoes a structural transition and exhibits antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order below room temperature . doping with electrons or holes into the parent compound",
    "will suppress the structural and magnetic transitions and induce sc @xcite .",
    "nowadays it is widely believed that sc is directly coupled to the magnetism in iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "there is also clear evidence about the strong spin - lattice coupling @xcite . meanwhile , though the electron - phonon ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) coupling alone can not explain the high critical temperature , it is proved that the @xmath4-@xmath5 coupling effect definitely plays some role in the sc mechanism @xcite , probably through the spin - channel @xcite . hence a better understanding of the magneto - structural coupling effect and the lattice dynamics in the iron - arsenide parent compounds is important in unraveling the sc pairing mechanism of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xmath6fe mssbauer spectroscopy ( ms ) is an excellent probe for both structural and magnetic local properties in iron - containing compounds . in iron - based superconductors the iron element serves as the primary constituent , which makes ms a useful analytical tool @xcite , especially for investigating the lattice dynamics in these systems",
    "indeed , ms has been widely used to study the iron - based superconductors , e.g. refeaso ( re = rare earth elements ) @xcite , afe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( a = ba , ca , eu ) system @xcite and lifeas @xcite .",
    "however , properties regarding magneto - structural coupling effect and lattice dynamics are hardly discussed in most of these works . in the present work , single crystals of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 were synthesized and studied in detail by ms in the temperature range of 18k to 290k . it is found that upon cooling through 170k , cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 undergoes a first - order magneto - structural phase transition and changes from a tetragonal thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type paramagnetic ( pm ) phase to an orthorhombic afm phase @xcite .",
    "our observations suggest that the lattice dynamics of both the tetragonal and orthorbombic phases are very similar in the high - frequency modes , which could be denoted by the almost same debye temperatures of the two phases .",
    "single crystals of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 were grown by the feas self - flux method described elsewhere @xcite . the resistivity and hall effect analysis were reported earlier @xcite .",
    "the phase purity of the crystalline sample was confirmed by single crystal x - ray diffraction measurements using a philips xpert diffractometer with cu k@xmath7 radiation .",
    "dc magnetization measurement was carried out through a commercial ( quantum design ) superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer .",
    "the transmission mssbauer spectra were recorded using a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer with a @xmath8-ray source of 25mci @xmath6co in palladium matrix moving at room temperature .",
    "the absorber was kept static in a temperature - controllable cryostat .",
    "all isomer shifts are quoted relative to @xmath9-fe at room temperature .",
    "the mssbauer spectra are fitted with mosswinn 3.0i programme @xcite .",
    "fig . [ xrd ] presents the single crystal x - ray diffraction pattern of the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 compound .",
    "the inset shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility measured under h = 5 t .",
    "as can be seen , only ( 00l ) diffraction peaks are observed , indicating that the crystallographic c - axis is perpendicular to the plane of the plate - like single crystal .",
    "the susceptibility curve shows an anomaly around 165k corresponding to the magneto - structural phase transition , which is similar to previous reports @xcite .",
    "all these results indicate that the sample has a good quality and hence a good starting point for the following ms measurements .",

    "the spectra taken between 18k-155k were fitted with two zeeman patterns as discussed in the text .",
    "the spectra recorded at 160k and 165k were fitted with a sextet and an asymmetric doublet .",
    "the spectra taken above 170k were fitted with only one asymmetric doublet.,width=8 ]    the @xmath6fe mssbauer spectra of the single crystal cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 recorded in the temperature range of 18k-290k are shown in fig .",
    "[ ms ] . above 170k ,",
    "the spectra are quadrupole split paramagnetic lines and can be well fitted with only one asymmetric doublet .",
    "this means that the local environment of the fe ion is unique , indicating no impurity phases exist in the mssbauer absorber .",
    "the spectra recorded at 160k and 165k were fitted with a sextet corresponding to the afm phase and an asymmetric doublet corresponding to the residual paramagnetic phase .",
    "the coexistence of both phases is characteristic for first - order phase transitions . at temperatures below 155k",
    ", the spectra can be fitted with the superposition of two zeeman patterns .",
    "two subspectra are needed to get a better fit to the observed spectra , which is similar to previous reports @xcite .",
    "this may be understood as both commensurate ( main component ) and incommensurate ( minor component ) spin density waves ( sdw ) exist in the sample .",
    "the incommensurate sdw has also been observed in ref @xcite , where three sextets are used to fit the mssbauer spectrum . yet",
    "the incommensurability in 122-type iron - based parent compounds seems to be controversial .",
    "for example , for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds one component is enough to get a good fit to the spectrum and the shape of the sdw is quasirectangular @xcite at low temperatures . while the shape of the sdw does not develop a fully quasirectangular shape @xcite even at liquid helium temperature , which may be due to the incommensurate sdw .",
    "so , understanding the incommensurate sdw certainly deserves much more careful experimental examinations .",
    "the temperature dependence of hyperfine parameters extracted by fitting the measured mssbauer spectra at different temperatures are plotted in fig [ mspara ] .",
    "it is well known that the total isomer shift ( @xmath10 ) is the sum of chemical shift ( @xmath11 ) and thermal shift ( @xmath12 ) , i.e. @xmath13 . as shown in fig [ mspara ] ( a ) , the isomer shift has a typical value of 0.42mm / s for the 122-type iron - based superconductors at room temperature @xcite . upon cooling",
    ", @xmath10 increases gradually before 170k , the characteristic of @xmath12 , then shows a sudden increase in a narrow temperature range , which could be mainly ascribed to the contribution of @xmath11 . in mssbauer experiments",
    ", @xmath11 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the electron density at the iron nucleus for @xmath9-fe and the absorber , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is a calibration constant , which is positive for @xmath6fe nucleus .",
    "thus , a positive isomer shift indicates a smaller electron density at the iron nucleus in the sample than in @xmath9-fe .",
    "therefore , the sharp increase in @xmath10 at @xmath17165k corresponds to a decrease in the electron density at the iron nucleus , which may arises from the changes of the unit volume at the transition temperature .",
    "the structural transition results in larger fe - as distances in the orthorhombic phase , which reduces the interaction between fe-3d and as-4p electrons and leads to more localized fe-3d electrons .",
    "this will enhance the screening effect of the fe-3d electrons to s electrons near the nuclear , causing smaller s - electron densities at the iron nucleus thus a bigger isomer shift .",
    "temperature dependence of the mssbauer hyperfine parameters extracted by fitting the spectra taken at different temperatures .",
    "( a ) isomer shift @xmath10 , ( b ) line width @xmath18 , ( c ) quadrupole splitting @xmath19.,width=8 ]    the spectrum line width , @xmath18 , and quadrupole splitting , @xmath19 , are shown in fig [ mspara ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "they both show an anomaly around 165k , which is ascribed to the magneto - structural phase transition .",
    "one should notice that the line broadening actually appears at temperatures above the phase transition .",
    "similar line broadening effect has been observed in ( ba@xmath20k@xmath21)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems @xcite .",
    "the most probable reason for the line broadening effect can be considered as the onset of magnetic order and/or short range magnetic fluctuations that presents in the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 compound @xcite .",
    "these observations highly suppose the magnetic origin of the magneto - structural phase transition in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 parent compound . upon cooling",
    ", some fe spins happen to form clusters with short - ranged magnetic order in the nonmagnetic matrix by spin fluctuations of the fe-3d charges .",
    "these spin clusters broaden the line width instead of detectable hyperfine field . with further cooling",
    ", the phase transition happens when the spin clusters reaches its critical point and causes structural distortion simultaneously to optimize the energy of the system due to spin - lattice coupling effect .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that the magnetic fluctuations and spin - lattice coupling effect may be responsible for the magneto - structural phase transition in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 compound .",
    "the reduced hyperfine magnetic field vs reduced temperature for the single crystal cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 sample .",
    "the solid line is theoretical fit to the experimental data obtained on heating , assuming @xmath22=170k ( see text).,width=8 ]    to examine the magnetic properties and get insight into the afm phase transition , the temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field is investigated using a mean field model after bean and rodbell @xcite , which , while describing the order parameter variation correctly , does not yield information about the magentic fluctuations in side of the hysteretic region , observed here .",
    "the reduced hyperfine magnetic field vs reduced temperature is plotted in fig [ bhft ] and the solid line is the calculated theoretical curve . in the bean - rodbell model , the temperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization in a afm material is expressed as @xcite @xmath23 in the low spin state approximation .",
    "@xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the reduced sublattice magnetization , @xmath26 is a fitting parameter ( @xmath27 for a second order transition , @xmath28 for a first order transition and for @xmath29 the equation reduces to a brillouin function ) , @xmath30 is the slope of the dependence of transition temperature on volume , @xmath22 would be the transition temperature if the lattice were not compressible , @xmath31 is the compressibility , @xmath32 is the temperature and @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "as can be seen , fig [ bhft ] shows an approximate agreement between the theory and experimental data .",
    "the observed hyperfine field decreases more faster with increasing temperature than the theory predicts in the low temperature range , which could be explained by the low - lying spin excitations as evidenced by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath26 and @xmath34 with fixed @xmath22=170k are found to be 1.35 and 9.73 t , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath26 indicates that the nature of the afm transition is of first order .",
    "this is in agreement with previously reported thermodynamic , transport and microscopic data @xcite .",
    "and the fitted zero point hyperfine field is very close to the value ( @xmath35@xmath1710 t ) reported by kumar et al .",
    "@xcite at 4.2k .    if we assume the bean - rodbell model to be valid , we may determine the compressibility of the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 compound . according to the bean - rodbell model ,",
    "the compressibility is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the volume change at the transition .",
    "if we take from experimental values , the volume change @xmath38 @xcite ( the negative sign of @xmath37 means a compression of the lattice during the afm / pm transition , which is consistent with the bethe - slater curve . ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( taken at t=165k ) , @xmath41 and , assuming @xmath42 ( corresponding a density of 7@xmath43 ) , one gets @xmath44 .",
    "the results is very close to the value of first principles calculations on cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath45 ) @xcite , while a little larger than that of the reported experimental values , @xmath46 for the lafepo @xcite and @xmath47 for the nd(o@xmath48f@xmath49)feas @xcite .",
    "thus a direct measurement of the compressibility would be a useful check on this theory .    as discussed above ,",
    "the magneto - structural phase transition in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is first - order in nature . in order to obtain a theoretical interpretation of our experiments ,",
    "we adopt the phenomenological landau theory of phase transitions to the system under study . in landau s theory the free - energy density of the system is expanded in terms of two order parameters of @xmath25 ( sublattice magnetization ) and @xmath50 ( strain ) as @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the elastic modulus and @xmath53 is the magneto - elastic coupling coefficient . minimizing the total energy with respect to the strain yields @xmath54 . substituting @xmath50 with @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ landau1 ] ) , one obtains a renormalized 2 - 4 - 6 landau free energy , @xmath55 the magneto - elastic coupling is presented by the fourth order term . to estimate the coefficient of this term",
    ", we turn to the bean - rodbell model , from which the magnetic part of the free energy without external field is also a 2 - 4 - 6 function of @xmath25 , as @xcite @xmath56 comparing eq .",
    "( [ landau2 ] ) and ( [ beang ] ) , clearly , the sign of @xmath57 is determined by @xmath58 , which is negative when @xmath41 around the transition temperature .",
    "a negative fourth order term in landau free energy creates an energy barrier in the free energy landscape , this leads to a first - order transition .",
    "obviously , a large magneto - elastic coupling coefficient @xmath53 results in a large negative fourth order term .",
    "the more negative is this term , the larger is the transition barrier , and the more distinct are the first - order transition characters . on the other hand ,",
    "a larger @xmath53 leads to a larger spontaneous lattice distortion upon the magnetic transition .",
    "therefore , the strength of the magneto - elastic coupling @xmath53 can be represented by the magnitude of the spontaneous lattice distortion , like @xmath26 , which involves the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath30 that are related to the volume change .",
    "@xmath26 also controls the order of the magnetic phase transition . according to eq .",
    "( [ beang ] ) , one always gets a negative fourth order term when @xmath59 , indicating a first - order magnetic phase transition at @xmath22 due to the energy barrier from magneto - elastic coupling .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath26 predicts the strength of the coupling .    to investigate the lattice dynamics of the fe atoms , the temperature dependence of the lamb - mssbauer factor or recoil - free fraction , @xmath60 , is discussed in what follows . in debye model of the lattice dynamics , @xmath60 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath61 } , \\label{lmfactor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath62 is the debye temperature , and @xmath63 is the recoil energy of an free emitting nucleus . in high temperature ( @xmath64 ) approximation ,",
    "we may rewrite eq .",
    "( [ lmfactor ] ) as the following formula @xcite : @xmath65 here @xmath66 and @xmath10 are termed as the anharmonic coefficient and they are both very small values .",
    "logarithm of the relative @xmath60 factor versus temperature.,width=8 ]    the temperature dependence of @xmath67 is shown in fig [ area ] .",
    "it is evident that upon cooling , the curve drops steeply through 170k to 150k due to the occurrence of the phase transition .",
    "this sudden increase in @xmath68 is likely due to the thickness effect , i.e. the increase of spectral area when overlapping peaks separate from each other , as it usually happens when a magnetic phase transition takes place @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath68 beyond this temperature region is quite linear , i.e. fe atoms experience harmonic vibrations in both tetragonal phase and orthorhombic phase .",
    "since the anharmonic effect characterized by @xmath66 and @xmath10 is negligible , the @xmath68 data can be simply fitted with @xmath69 , where @xmath70 was treated as a free parameter .",
    "the best - fit of the experimental data shown in fig . [ area ] yields the following results : @xmath71 for the segment below the phase transition and @xmath72 for the segment above the phase transition .",
    "the nearly same behaviors of @xmath68 with temperature indicates that no obvious changes of the phonon modes in high frequency ranges of the fe vibrational state , which is in agreement with inelastic neutron scattering results @xcite on the phonon spectrum .",
    "moreover , the observed harmonic vibrational behavior of the iron atoms indicates that the large phonon linewidths in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 observed by neutron scattering @xcite may be due to to strong electron - phonon coupling effect .",
    "furthermore , theoretical calculations of the phonon spectrum show that including magnetism does not improve agreement with experiments @xcite for cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "this is rather different for other 122-type , srfeasf @xcite and lafeaso @xcite 1111-type systems , where the authors show that including magnetic degree of freedom greatly improves the agreements with experiments .",
    "thus more work is necessary to understand these properties .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the structural and magnetic properties of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystal in detail by mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "our results show that the structural distortion and magnetic transition are coalesced into one single first - order magneto - structural phase transition through strong magneto - structural coupling effect .",
    "short - range magnetic order and/or spin fluctuations appears well above the magneto - structural phase transition temperature and may be responsible for the phase transition . analyzing the temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field in the bean - rodbell model , we are able to determine the compressibility of the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystal , @xmath73 . both the pm and afm phases exhibit similar lattice dynamic behaviors of the fe atoms in high - frequency modes and they both have a debye temperature close to @xmath17270k",
