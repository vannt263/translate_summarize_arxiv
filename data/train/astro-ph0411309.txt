    "many local starburst galaxies have galactic - scale outflows of metal - enriched gas , called starburst superwinds , which are driven by the stellar winds and supernovae of numerous massive stars ( _ e.g. , _ heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ) .",
    "these outflows contain a hot ( @xmath2  k ) , metal - enriched wind fluid as well as entrained cooler gas and dust @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the hot gas can escape from the potential well of the parent galaxy , enriching the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with metals and energy @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether the colder gas can escape , and this is an important question since it would mean that superwinds also enrich the igm with dust , which could affect observations of high - redshift objects @xcite .",
    "this question is even more crucial since similar outflows are now known to be common in high - redshift starbursts @xcite .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that superwinds contain dust @xcite .",
    "optical imaging polarimetry shows light scattered by dust in the halos of starburst galaxies , including m82 ( e.g scarrott , eaton , & axon 1991 ; alton et al . 1994 ) .",
    "far - ir and sub - mm imaging reveal thermal emission from extraplanar dust in several edge - on starburst galaxies ( alton , davies , & bianchi 1999 ) .",
    "finally , the strong correlation between the strength of the blueshifted interstellar na  d line and the line - of - sight reddening in superwinds @xcite , strongly suggests the dust is actually outflowing .",
    "what remains unclear is the physical relationship between the cool dust - bearing gas and the warm and hot gas probed by optical lines and x - rays respectively .",
    "comparison of sensitive , high resolution images of the dusty material with h@xmath1  and x - ray emission images would shed light on this relationship .",
    "dust is highly reflective in the ultraviolet ( uv ) @xcite , so imaging of starburst superwinds in the uv can trace the location of dust , if one can account for uv emission by photoionized or shock - heated gas . indeed , ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) near - uv data for m82 show evidence of uv light in the halo corresponding to known h@xmath1features @xcite . here",
    "we present galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) ultraviolet images of two prototypical starburst superwind galaxies : ngc  253 and m82 .",
    "the images reveal prominent uv light in the superwind region .",
    "our goal is to understand the origin of this light .",
    "ngc  253 was observed by galex on 2003 october 13 for 3289 seconds .",
    "m82 was observed by galex on 2003 december 8 for 3083 seconds .",
    "the galex data include far - ultraviolet ( fuv ; @xmath3   , @xmath4   ) and near - ultraviolet ( nuv ; @xmath5   , @xmath6   ) images with a circular field of view with radius @xmath7@xmath8 .",

    "extended h@xmath1  emission was noted by @xcite .",
    "diffuse emission extending several kpc into the halo on both sides of the disk , north - east of the galaxy center with the brightest and more extended emission toward the east end of the disk .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray emission matched the h@xmath1  emission in morphology .",
    "these features are also visible in the galex images .",
    "figure  [ m82fig ] shows the uv and h@xmath1  images of m82 ( in the same manner as figure  [ n253fig ] ) .",
    "the m82 images show a bright , complex network of filaments , very different in appearance from ngc  253 .",
    "the morphology in the uv and h@xmath1  images is strikingly similar .",
    "prominent h@xmath1  filaments are seen perpendicular to the disk on both sides , surrounded by a lower surface brightness component of diffuse light ( see also ohyama et al .",
    "the filaments are also visible in the uv , but there is less contrast between the filaments and the diffuse uv light .",
    "the galex images are much more sensitive than the earlier uit nuv image @xcite , and show that the uv - h@xmath1  correlation in morphology extends to very faint h@xmath1  filaments , and exists in the fuv as well ( which was not detected by uit ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the x - ray and h@xmath1  morphology are similar on all scales , and this is also true for the uv light .",
    "the h@xmath1  and x - ray `` cap '' @xcite 11  kpc above the north side of the disk is visible in both galex bands",

    "figure  [ ratios ] also shows model predictions for the continuum ( balmer , bremsstrahlung , and two - photon ) and line emission of shock - heated and photoionized gas @xcite .",
    "the shock models span shock velocities from 100 to 900 kms@xmath35 , and include both shock and precursor emission .",
    "the photoionization models are of spherically symmetric clouds ionized by a central source ( the uv continuum of the ionizing source is not included in the model predictions ) , and span stellar temperatures ranging from 30000  k to 50000  k and electron densities from 0.1 to 10  @xmath36 .",
    "solar abundances were assumed in both cases .    most of the regions have too much uv light ( relative to h@xmath1 ) to be explained by nebular emission alone .",
    "the observed fuv / h@xmath1ratios in some of the brighter regions in the m82 halo are consistent with a significant contribution from shock ionization , but these values have _ not _ been corrected for extinction intrinsic to the wind .",
    "the optical spectrum of the m82 wind indicates a reddening of @xmath37  mag @xcite , which would increase the observed fuv / h@xmath1  ratios by a factor of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 for nuv / h@xmath1 ) .",
    "this implies that the wind is substantially brighter in fuv and nuv than would be possible for photoionized or shock heated gas .",
    "the absence of emission seen in _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "data limits shock speeds in the bright m82 filaments to @xmath40  km  s@xmath35 @xcite , much slower than the wind velocity ( @xmath41  km  s@xmath35 , strickland & stevens 2000 ) . taken together",
    ", these facts imply that another source is required to explain the excess extraplanar uv light .",
    "the diffuse morphology argues against star formation in the wind as the source .",
    "the most likely remaining mechanism is scattering of stellar continuum from the starburst by dust in the halo .",
    "the spectral slopes @xmath42 in the halo implied by the observed fuv / nuv ratio are listed in table  [ lum ] .",
    "the values are redder than an unreddened starburst ( @xmath43 ) , and in fact agree well with observed ( _ i .",
    "e. , _ reddened ) values of local starbursts ( @xmath44 ; meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1999 ) .",
    "while it is clear that dust in a starburst environment may have properties that differ from the standard galactic dust models @xcite , the fuv / nuv ratio is in general agreement with the dust scattering models of @xcite in which the dust albedo is greater in the nuv than in the fuv .    in a sample of local star forming galaxies",
    ", @xcite found that the observed h@xmath1  flux was on average 2.5 - 5.0% of the observed uv flux near 2000    ( similar to the galex nuv band ) .",
    "the observed h@xmath1flux of the ngc  253 halo is 5% of the nuv flux , and for m82 the corresponding value is 12% .",
    "this may indicate that not all of the h@xmath1  emission in the m82 halo is scattered light , although polarization measurements indicate the presence of some scattered light in the h@xmath1  filaments and the more extended diffuse h@xmath1component of m82 ( _ e .",
    "g. , _ scarrott et al .",
    "scattered light could be a substantial component of the fainter ngc  253 halo .",
    "@xcite suggested that the h@xmath1  cap near m82 is the result of a collision between the hot wind fluid and a pre - existing neutral cloud .",
    "if this scenario is correct , our results imply that the cloud is not primordial since it contains dust .",
    "the cloud may have been pushed out of m82 by the starburst wind or stripped from either m82 or m81 by the tidal interaction between the two galaxies .",
    "our results establish for the first time a close morphological correspondence between the dust and the hotter phases of the winds probed in h@xmath1  and x - ray emission .",
    "we have direct evidence that the hotter gas is outflowing ( _ e.g. , _ strickland & stevens 2000 ) , so the new uv images provide further evidence for outflowing dust @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the cool dusty material is ambient interstellar gas in the disk or inner halo that has been has been entrained and accelerated by the hot outflowing gas generated in the starburst .    if this dust is ejected into the igm , there could be important implications for cosmological observations . while the dust density is small , over cosmological distances the resulting extinction could be significant @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that intergalactic dust may affect the determination of the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate , for example .",
