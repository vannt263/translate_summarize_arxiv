    "there are several well - known results in the study of finite group actions on special @xmath0-manifolds , starting with the work @xcite of milnor , who gave a list of all finite groups which are susceptible to act freely and orientation - preserving on spheres . in the @xmath0-dimensional case , by elliptization of three - manifolds",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and thurston s orbifold theorem ( see @xcite and @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , the only finite groups which can act on @xmath1 preserving the orientation are the finite subgroups of @xmath2 .",
    "it happens also that the list of finite groups acting on integral and , more generally , @xmath3-homology spheres is quite restricted @xcite .",
    "a _ group of symmetries _ of a ( non - oriented ) link @xmath4 in @xmath1 is a finite group @xmath5 acting on @xmath1 preserving the orientation and leaving @xmath4 invariant .",
    "in particular , a group of symmetries is a finite subgroup of @xmath2 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath4 is a non - trivial knot , it follows from smith s conjecture @xcite that the only possible groups of symmetries for @xmath4 are either cyclic or dihedral .",
    "note also that , in general , a link does not have a unique ( maximal ) group of symmetries @xcite ( up to conjugation ) , but this is indeed the case if the link is hyperbolic .",
    "observe in fact , that each symmetry of the link @xmath4 induces an orientation - preserving diffeomorphism of the complement of the link , which on its turn , if @xmath4 is hyperbolic , gives rise to an isometry of the hyperbolic structure .",
    "( for basic facts and definitions in hyperbolic geometry the reader is referred to @xcite . )",
    "one can then ask : _ what is the relation between symmetries of a hyperbolic link and isometries of its complement ? _ as knots are determined by their complements @xcite , isometries of the complement of a knot are also symmetries .",
    "however , when the link has several components , the group of symmetries of a hyperbolic link is only a subgroup of the group of isometries of its complement . in general this subgroup",
    "can be proper , for a generic isometry does not need to preserve a peripheral structure on the cusps .",
    "examples of isometries of exteriors of hyperbolic links which are not induced by symmetries can be found in @xcite , where both groups are computed using jeff week s program snappea for links with at most nine crossings . for most links in their list",
    "both groups coincide , and when they do not , the index of the symmetry group in the isometry one is rather small ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "also , the symmetry groups which appear are of very special types ( either abelian , or dihedral ) .",
    "this behavior is certainly due to the limited number of crossings and components considered .",
    "indeed , in this paper we prove :    [ thm ] every finite group @xmath5 is the group of orientation preserving isometries of the complement of some hyperbolic link in @xmath1 . moreover , @xmath5 acts freely .",
    "it was already known that every finite group can be realized as an isometry group of some closed hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold : kojima proved that every finite group can be realized as the full group of isometries of a closed hyperbolic manifold @xcite , with a not necessarily free action .",
    "besides , cooper and long showed that every finite group acts freely on some hyperbolic rational homology sphere @xcite ; in this case the full isometry group might a priori be larger .",
    "although the aforementioned results are related to the one presented in this paper , it deserves to be stressed that there are some peculiarities which come from the fact that we want to control several things at the same time : the structure of the manifold ( i.e.  the complement of a link in @xmath1 ) , the type of action ( i.e.  free ) , and the fact that no extra isometries are introduced .    given a finite group @xmath5 , it is not difficult to construct a link in @xmath1 ( and even a hyperbolic one , thanks to a result of myers @xcite ) whose complement admits an effective free @xmath5-action ( see proposition  [ prop ] ) , but it is rather delicate to ensure that @xmath5 coincides with the whole isometry group of the complement .",
    "notice that the naive idea to drill out some  asymmetric \" link in a @xmath5-equivariant way does not work , for the fact of removing simple closed curves has the effect of possibly increasing the group of isometries .",
    "the idea is thus to choose the link in such a way that its complement contains some very rigid structure ( in our case , totally geodesic pants ) and use it to control the isometry group .    as a by - product of our result we are able to prove that cooper and long s result can be rigidified , that is , that the hyperbolic rational homology sphere on which the group @xmath5 acts freely can be chosen so that @xmath5 coincides with the full orientation preserving isometry group .",
    "[ cor ] any finite group @xmath5 is the full orientation - preserving isometry group of a hyperbolic rational homology sphere .",
    "moreover @xmath5 acts freely .    before passing to the proof of the result , which will be the content of sections  [ section : construction ] and [ section : nomoreisos ] , we state the following :    [ linksymmetries ] for any finite group @xmath7 acting on @xmath1 , there exists a hyperbolic link whose group of symmetries is precisely @xmath7 .",
    "we start by noticing that myer s theorem works in an @xmath7-invariant setting ( it suffices to choose an @xmath7-invariant triangulation ) if one does not require the resulting hyperbolic link to be connected ( see the proof of lemma  [ claim : asymmetric hyperbolic link ] for a similar reasoning ) . in this case",
    "one can indeed exploit the naive idea to add some  asymmetric \" but @xmath7-invariant link to ensure that @xmath7 coincides with the whole group of symmetries .",
    "more precisely , given any finite group @xmath5 acting on @xmath1 , take @xmath8 copies of a knot @xmath9 which admits no symmetry , in such a way that each copy is contained in a ball which misses all the fixed - point sets of elements of @xmath7 , and such that the pairs ( ball,@xmath9 ) are freely permuted by the action of @xmath7 .",
    "it is now possible , using a result of myers @xcite , to find an @xmath7-invariant link @xmath10 so that no component of @xmath10 is the knot @xmath9 and the complement of @xmath11 is hyperbolic .",
    "it is now straightforward to see that the group of symmetries of the link @xmath4 is precisely @xmath7 .",
    "note finally that in both constructions , theorem  [ thm ] and proposition  [ linksymmetries ] , the number of components of the links constructed is pretty large .",
    "it would be interesting to understand whether , for a given group @xmath5 , there is some bound on the number of components of a link on which @xmath5 acts as group of symmetries / isometries and under which conditions the lower bound can be realized .",
    "the following result is easy and is the starting point to prove our main result .",
    "[ prop ] every finite group acts effectively and freely by orientation - preserving isometries on the complement of some hyperbolic link in the @xmath0-sphere .    fix a finite group @xmath5 .",
    "it is not difficult to find a closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath12 on which @xmath5 acts effectively and freely ; moreover , cooper and long @xcite showed that @xmath12 can be chosen to be hyperbolic and a rational homology sphere .",
    "the dehn surgery theorem of lickorish @xcite and wallace @xcite assures the existence of a link @xmath13 contained in @xmath12 whose exterior is contained in the @xmath0-sphere , i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath4 is a link .",
    "we want to show that @xmath13 can be chosen @xmath5-invariant , thanks to a general position argument .",
    "take the quotient @xmath15 . by perturbing slightly the image of @xmath13 inside the quotient",
    ", we can assume that it has no self - intersection .",
    "note that the complement of the @xmath5-invariant link of @xmath12 obtained this way is again contained in @xmath1 , for we can assume that the perturbation performed did not affect the isotopy class of the components corresponding to the original link .",
    "now , using a result of myers @xcite , we can find in @xmath15 a knot @xmath16 whose exterior is hyperbolic .",
    "the preimage in @xmath12 of @xmath17 is a link with the desired properties .",
    "_ proof of theorem  [ thm ] .",
    "_ we start with @xmath5 acting on @xmath18 for some link @xmath19 , as in proposition  [ prop ] . a priori the group @xmath20 can be larger than @xmath5 , and we shall modify the link so that both groups are precisely the same .",
    "denote by @xmath21 the quotient @xmath22 .",
    "choose a genus-@xmath23 unknotted handlebody contained in a ball of @xmath21 .",
    "using @xcite , we can find a hyperbolic knot @xmath16 in @xmath24 , whose exterior is , moreover , anannular .",
    "fix three meridional curves @xmath25 , @xmath26 , on the boundary of @xmath7 as shown in figure  [ handle ] .",
    "observe that each @xmath25 is non - separating , but the three of them cut @xmath27 in two pairs of pants .",
    "the manifold @xmath28 has a non - compact boundary , consisting of two cusped pairs of pants , and admits a hyperbolic structure with totally geodesic boundary : this last fact follows from thurston s hyperbolization theorem , since the manifold is atoroidal and its compact core is anannular .",
    "notice that the curves @xmath25 correspond to rank one cusps .",
    "we consider the handlebody @xmath7 .",
    "[ claim : asymmetric hyperbolic link ] there exists a link @xmath10 inside @xmath7 such that @xmath29 satisfies the following properties :    1 .",
    "it is hyperbolic with totally geodesic boundary .",
    "2 .   it contains a unique geodesic @xmath30 of minimal length .",
    "3 .   its orientation preserving isometry group is trivial",
    ".     contained in a ball and the three curves @xmath25.,width=226 ]    consider the group @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the dihedral group of order @xmath33 , which coincides with the symmetric group on three elements .",
    "this group acts on the pair @xmath34 as illustrated in figure  [ sym]a : the central element of order two is the hyperelliptic involution fixing all three curves @xmath25 while exchanging the two pairs of pants ( its  axis \" is a circle in the figure ) , the elements of @xmath32 leave invariant each pair of pants and permute the curves @xmath25 .",
    "consider now the quotient orbifold ( see figure  [ sym]b ) @xmath35 remove from @xmath36 a simple closed curve @xmath37 contained in a ball which does not meet the singular locus .",
    "choose a triangulation of the compact core of @xmath38 which contains the singular locus : such triangulation lifts to a @xmath31-equivariant triangulation of the compact core of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the lift of @xmath37 .",
    "taking the second baricentric subdivision of such triangulation , one can get a  special handle decomposition \" and the very same proof as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) shows that one can find a hyperbolic link @xmath41 which is @xmath31-invariant and whose exterior @xmath42 has anannular compact core .",
    "consider now @xmath40 : it consists of twelve connected components , for each of which we choose a meridian - longitude system @xmath43 .",
    "one can perform hyperbolic dehn surgery with meridian curves @xmath44 , @xmath45 so that the lengths of the surgered geodesics are pairwise distinct and of shortest length inside the resulting manifold @xmath29 , @xmath10 being the image of @xmath46 after surgery .     acting on @xmath7 and the quotient orbifold @xmath36.,width=377 ]    consider now an orientation - preserving isometry of @xmath29 . since they have minimal length , the twelve geodesics obtained by hyperbolic surgery must be left invariant by the isometry , which thus induces an isometry of the exterior of the geodesics .",
    "this means that the isometry must act as one of the elements of @xmath31 , since it is determined by its action on the boundary and since @xmath31 is the complete group of positive isometries of the boundary .",
    "but only the identity element of @xmath31 extends to @xmath29 , for all twelve geodesics must be left setwise fixed , because their lengths are pairwise distinct .",
    "the boundary components of @xmath29 are two totally geodesic pairs of pants with cusps ( topologically , they are @xmath47 ) . by abuse of notation , @xmath25 denotes the curve and also the corresponding cusp .",
    "[ lemma : no_pants ] the only embedded geodesic pair of pants in @xmath29 having cusps @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are its boundary components .",
    "let @xmath51 be an embedded pair of pants with cusps @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "by the geometry of margulis tubes , @xmath51 must be disjoint from the cores of the filling tori , thus @xmath52 ( recall that @xmath53 was defined in the proof of lemma  [ claim : asymmetric hyperbolic link ] , and that it is the result of removing the twelve shortest geodesics ) .",
    "the pants @xmath51 can be rendered totally geodesic also in @xmath53 , because @xmath53 minus an open tubular neighborhood of @xmath51 @xmath54 has still an irreducible , atoroidal , and anannular compact core .",
    "( this follows from the fact that every simple closed curve in @xmath51 is either compressible or boundary parallel . ) by thurston s hyperbolization , @xmath55 is hyperbolic with totally geodesic boundary , consisting of two copies of @xmath56 that we can glue back by an isometry .",
    "next we claim that @xmath51 is equivariant by the action of @xmath31 . to prove it",
    ", we look carefully at the geometry of the cusps @xmath25 . a horospherical section of the cups @xmath25 is a euclidean annulus @xmath57 , and @xmath51 intersects the annulus @xmath57 in a circle metrically parallel to the boundary components @xmath58 .",
    "thus the intersection of @xmath51 with those annuli must be equivariant .",
    "since the action of @xmath31 on @xmath56 is determined by its restriction to the cusps , it follows that @xmath56 is equivariant .     on the annulus @xmath57.,width=226 ]    now we consider the possible quotients of @xmath51 by its stabilizer , and look at how they project on @xmath59 .",
    "we remark that , on the circle of the intersection of @xmath51 with each horospherical annulus @xmath57 , the projection to the quotient restricts to a map of the circle @xmath60 to its quotient which is either @xmath23 to @xmath61 , or @xmath62 to @xmath61 ( figure  [ annulus ] ) . in the former case ,",
    "the quotient is a circle , in the latter , an interval with mirror boundary .",
    "this implies that the stabilizer of @xmath51 must contain at least three orientation preserving involutions , one for each cusp , and corresponding to the product of the two involutions whose axes are pictured in figure  [ annulus ] ( i.e.  a rotation on the @xmath63 factor ) . as the orientation preserving isometry group of the pants is @xmath64 , it follows that the only possible quotients for @xmath51 are the ones described in figure  [ quotients ] .    .",
    "case @xmath65 is non orientable , has mirror points ( double lines ) , and corners.,width=226 ]    in fact case b in figure  [ quotients ] is not possible , as the mirror points have to agree with singular points of order @xmath23 in the orbifold @xmath66 in figure  [ sym]b .",
    "we claim that the quotient of @xmath56 is parallel to the boundary in @xmath36 . to see that ,",
    "notice that @xmath59 is the exterior in @xmath36 of an anannular hyperbolic link with two components , @xmath37 and the quotient of @xmath46 .",
    "those components can not be separated by the quotient of @xmath56 , because otherwise the disc in @xmath36 bounded by @xmath37 would give either a compressing disc or an essential annulus in @xmath67 , contradicting that @xmath56 is totally geodesic .",
    "hence @xmath37 and the quotient of @xmath46 are not separated by the quotient of @xmath56 , and therefore this quotient either bounds a handlebody or is parallel to the boundary .",
    "it can not bound a handlebody , since it is totally geodesic .",
    "hence @xmath51 must be a boundary component , because two parallel totally geodesic submanifolds must be the same .",
    "consider now the manifold @xmath68 .",
    "this is a hyperbolic manifold obtained by gluing together two hyperbolic manifolds along their totally geodesic boundaries , which consist of two pairs of pants : @xmath69 since the hyperbolic structure of a pair of pants ( with three cusps ) is unique , both pairs of pants are compatible when gluing and they remain totally geodesic inside the resulting manifold .",
    "take now the lift of @xmath70 to the @xmath0-sphere : we obtain the complement of a hyperbolic link @xmath4 in @xmath1 on which @xmath5 acts freely , in particular @xmath5 is a subgroup in @xmath20 .    notice that we glue along totally geodesic pants , therefore we do not make any deformation to the structure of each piece , and",
    "we get :    the shortest geodesic @xmath30 in @xmath29 from lemma  [ claim : asymmetric hyperbolic link ] may also be chosen to be the shortest in @xmath70 , and its lift in @xmath18 minimizes also the length spectrum .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath71 .",
    "arguing by contradiction , let @xmath72 be an isometry of the complement of @xmath4 which is not in @xmath5 .",
    "consider now @xmath73 the lift in @xmath18 of the shortest geodesic @xmath30 : it has as many components as the order of @xmath5 , since @xmath5 acts by freely permuting them .",
    "choose one component of @xmath73 , say @xmath74 .",
    "up to composing @xmath72 with an element of @xmath5 we can assume that @xmath75 . note that @xmath74 is separated from the other components of @xmath73 by a unique lift @xmath76 of both pairs of pants bounding @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath77 denote the lift of @xmath29 bounded by @xmath76 .",
    "we have @xmath78 .    seeking a contradiction ,",
    "assume that the intersection is empty . since @xmath79 separates and @xmath75 , by volume reasons @xmath76 must separate @xmath80 from @xmath81 .",
    "as every end of @xmath80 meets one end of @xmath81 along a cusp , @xmath72 stabilizes the set of three cusps @xmath82 , joining @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 ) is a totally geodesic embedded pant in @xmath77 , with the cusps @xmath82 . by lemma  [ lemma : no_pants ]",
    ", @xmath85 must be either @xmath83 or @xmath84 , hence a contradiction .",
    "[ claim : invariant boundary ] we have @xmath86 .    since",
    "both @xmath87 and @xmath76 are totally geodesic , if they do not coincide , their intersection must be a union of disjoint simple geodesics , which are properly embedded .",
    "figure  [ geod ] shows the possible form of non self - intersecting proper geodesics , depending on whether the ends are on the same or on different cusps .",
    "observe that , since two distinct cusps can not be sent by @xmath72 to the same one , the geodesics in the intersection look the same in @xmath76 and in @xmath87 .        assume that the intersection @xmath88 contains a geodesic as in figure  [ geod]a , for some @xmath89 .",
    "notice that the intersection @xmath90 does not contain more geodesics , because @xmath76 separates .",
    "consider now the half pant of @xmath91 contained inside @xmath77 : it contains a cusp which ends either on a cusp inside @xmath77 or on a cusp corresponding to a @xmath25 different from that on which the geodesic of the intersection ends . in both cases",
    "we can find an annulus , properly embedded in @xmath77 and joining two cusps .",
    "the annulus is illustrated in figure  [ inter]a : the shaded region is a disc contained in a section of the rank @xmath61 cusp .",
    "since @xmath77 is hyperbolic , the two cusps which support the annulus , must in fact be the same and the annulus must be boundary parallel .",
    "since totally geodesic parallel surfaces must be the same , it follows that @xmath92 .",
    "we can thus assume that the intersection @xmath90 contains a geodesic of the type pictured in figure  [ geod]b .",
    "since @xmath76 separates , @xmath90 must contain two other geodesics of the same type that divide @xmath91 into two triangles , as illustrated in figure  [ inter]b . if the three geodesics are not contained in a single pant @xmath93 (",
    "but in the union @xmath76 ) , they give an essential curve in the genus two surface @xmath94 , which is the boundary of a compressing disc ( half of @xmath95 ) ( cf .",
    "figure  [ triangleinhandle]a ) .",
    "hence we may assume that the geodesics are contained in one of the pairs of pants @xmath93 and therefore they cut it into two ideal triangles , as in figure  [ triangleinhandle]b .",
    "the union of half of @xmath91 and half of @xmath93 , along the three geodesics and three segments in @xmath82 , gives an embedded @xmath23-sphere .",
    "irreducibility gives a parallelism between triangles in @xmath93 and @xmath91 , hence @xmath92 .",
    "again for volume reasons , we see that the remaining pairs of pants must intersect . repeating the argument",
    "once more we reach the desired conclusion .    , viewed in @xmath96.,width=226 ]",
    "lemma  [ claim : invariant boundary ] implies that @xmath72 induces an isometry of @xmath97 . by lemma  [ claim : asymmetric hyperbolic link ]",
    "the restriction of @xmath72 to @xmath77 is the identity .",
    "since @xmath77 has nonempty interior in @xmath18 and @xmath72 is an isometry , we deduce that @xmath72 itself is the identity and the desired contradiction follows .",

    "the idea now is to do surgery in a @xmath5-equivariant way , so that we still have a rational homology sphere , and that the cores of the surgery tori are the shortest curves , so that the @xmath5-orbits of those curves are invariant by any isometry .    to do this surgery , we must be able to choose a @xmath5-equivariant meridian - longitude system @xmath43 on each peripheral torus ( i.e.  so that the image of @xmath98 in @xmath99 is trivial ) .",
