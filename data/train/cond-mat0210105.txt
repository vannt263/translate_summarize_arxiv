    "randomness in the external conditions entails the parameters of a dynamical system to fluctuate .",
    "the extent of these fluctuations is independent of any thermodynamic characteristic of the system in contrast to intrinsic fluctuations the amplitude of which is proportional to the equilibrium temperature , in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "usually , external randomness appears as a multiplicative noise in the dynamical equations .",
    "the interplay of noise and nonlinearity in a system far from equilibrium results in some unusual phenomena @xcite .",
    "in fact , the presence of noise dramatically alters the properties of a nonlinear dynamical system both qualitatively and quantitatively ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , it was shown recently that in a spatially - extended system , a multiplicative noise , white in space and time , generates an ordered symmetry - breaking state through a non - equilibrium phase transition whereas no such transition exists in the absence of noise @xcite .",
    "noise can also induce spatial patterns @xcite or improve the performance of a nonlinear device through stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even if some important qualitative features of a deterministic system survive to external noise , their quantitative characteristics may change : a stable fixed point may become unstable @xcite , a bifurcation may be delayed ( noise - induced stabilization ) @xcite and scale - invariant properties which manifest themselves as power - laws may be altered with the appearance of non - classical scaling exponents @xcite .",
    "the discovery of brownian motors which are able to rectify random fluctuations into a directed motion ( noise - induced transport ) has triggered a renewed interest in the study of simple one - dimensional mechanical models of particles in a potential with random parameters @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a linear oscillator submitted to parametric noise can be unstable even if damping is taken into account @xcite .",
    "this noise - induced energetic instability has been observed in diverse experimental contexts such as electronic oscillators @xcite , nematic liquid crystals @xcite and surface waves ( faraday instability ) @xcite . in engineering fields this instability plays a crucial role in the study of the dynamic response of flexible structures to random environmental loading such as the wave - induced motion of off - shore structures or the vibration of tall buildings in a turbulent wind @xcite .",
    "the presence of nonlinear friction tends to limit the oscillation amplitude : the pendulum with randomly vibrating suspension axis and undergoing nonlinear friction , known as the van der pol oscillator , has been studied in the small noise limit using perturbative expansions @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we consider the motion of an undamped nonlinear oscillator trapped in a general confining potential and submitted to parametric random fluctuations .",
    "because there is no dissipation , the energy of the system increases with time and we shall show that the position , the momentum and the energy grow as power - laws of time with nontrivial exponents that depend on the behavior of the confining potential at infinity @xcite . a key feature of our method is to use the integrability properties of the associated deterministic nonlinear oscillator in order to derive exact stochastic equations in action - angle variables .",
    "we then use the averaging technique of classical mechanics @xcite , together with a reduction procedure @xcite , to calculate exactly the anomalous scaling exponents , irrespective of the amplitude of the noise .",
    "some of our results were derived before in the particular case of a cubic nonlinearity using an energy - enveloppe equation @xcite .",
    "our method enables us to derive the numerical prefactors appearing in the scaling laws ( generalized diffusion constants ) , and our analytical predictions compare very satisfactorily with the numerical results . in the case of noise correlated in time ,",
    "the anomalous diffusion exponents are modified : they can be obtained by dimensional analysis arguments and the values thus found also agree with numerical results . throughout this work , crossover phenomena between different scaling regimes are emphasized .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : linear ] , we recall that the energy of a linear oscillator with multiplicative noise grows exponentially with time and that this growth may be characterized by a lyapunov exponent . in section [ sec : duff ] , we analyze the classical duffing oscillator in presence of parametric noise . our technique allows us to study precisely the long - time behavior of the system . in section [ sec : gen ] , we consider a particle in an arbitrary confining potential that grows as a polynomial at large distances . in section [ sec :",
