    "in a recent publication , j. hwang , t.timusk and g. d. gu @xcite have reported an infrared spectroscopy study of the optical conductivity as a function of doping in various samples of bi-2212 .",
    "the effect of doping into bi-2212 is to lower both the critical temperature , t@xmath3 , and the intensity of the resonance peak that appears in the superconducting state .",
    "this fact represents a unique opportunity to dissociate the resonance from the mechanism of superconductivity by means of a direct experiment .",
    "these authors have reported the fabrication of  several superconducting samples of bi-2212 with different doping content up to a particular one with 0.23 holes per cu atom that did not show the resonance anymore .",
    "its high critical temperature ( tc=55k ) demonstrates that superconductivity in this sample is still robust .",
    "this experimental fact leads to the sharp conclusion that the resonance can not be taken as the cause of superconductivity . nevertheless , since the resonance appears in the superconducting and only in the superconducting state , it should be somehow tightly bound to the phase transition itself .",
    "a resonance peak @xcite appears also in the spin polarized magnetic susceptibility , @xmath4 , at a frequency , @xmath5 , that is characteristic of the specific sample .",
    "the magnetic resonance peak appears as a common excitation to the superconducting state of all high - tc superconductors investigated by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) so far with a maximum t@xmath3 @xmath6 90k .",
    "the existence of the excitation does not depend on the number of cuo@xmath0 planes per unit cell : one for tl@xmath7ba@xmath0cuo@xmath8 , two for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath9 .",
    "it has never been observed in the monolayer system la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath12 with maximum tc @xmath6 40k @xcite .",
    "although , there are several proposals in the literature @xcite to trace the origin of the resonance to a mode of magnetic origin , we want to point to a direct and simple relation between the effect that the superconducting phase transition has on the electronic band structure , and the resonance itself .",
    "j. hwang , t.timusk and g. d. gu present in their quoted paper the optical single - particle self - energy which is directly related to the optical conductivity .",
    "they call the resonance that they find `` the resonance optical mode '' .",
    "this resonance optical mode in the optical conductivity , @xmath13 is produced at the same characteristic frequency , @xmath5 , as in the susceptibility .",
    "both resonances differ on details though .",
    "it is important to notice that the two thermodynamic functions can be considered mutually excluding each other in the sense that while the non - zero contributions to the matrix elements in the spin polarized susceptibility are intra - band , in the optical conductivity these are inter - band transitions . in that sense",
    "it might appear at first sight surprising that the two resonances have the same origin .",
    "_ @xcite assumed that the resonance in @xmath4 can be related to the effective spectrum of the spin fluctuations and used it to construct the eliashberg function of the conventional theory of superconductivity from which all the information on the thermodynamics follows @xcite .",
    "they have used this knowledge to calculate the resonance in the optical conductivity , @xmath14 in the superconducting state .",
    "their result agrees with experiment .",
    "they further used an inversion procedure @xcite that allows to extract information about the eliashberg function from the optical conductivity@xmath15 in this way they got back their assumed eliashberg function ( directly related to @xmath4 in their work ) .",
    "the procedure used by carbotte _",
    "_ establishes an essentially common origin to the resonance in both thermodynamic functions ( not to the functions themselves ) . since the experiments by j. hwang _",
    "@xcite neatly show that the resonance in the optical conductivity is not responsible for superconductivity , it is natural to expect that the resonance in the susceptibility will not be responsible for superconductivity as well and therefore can not be directly related to the real eliashberg function . but",
    "an important point is that carbotte _",
    "_ show explicitly that the resonances in both functions have a common origin .",
    "the resonance has been the object of a substantial amount of work in the last years @xcite .",
    "arpes experiments by lanzara _",
    "et al_. @xcite have shown that a `` kink '' in the kinetic energy spectra of several cuprate superconductors reveals a coupling of the carriers to the intermediate boson that causes the superconducting transition .",
    "they have attributed it to phonons .",
    "other researchers have attributed it rather to a coupling to a magnetic mode @xcite . a more recent paper by lanzara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite emphasizes the same previous conclusion : the intermediate boson is a phonon .",
    "it is clear @xcite that the optical self - energy as measured by infrared is somehow related to the quasiparticle self - energy as measured in arpes experiments but they are not identical and there are important differences in the two quantities @xcite .    to calculate the optical conductivity in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , we start from an _ ab initio _ lapw three dimensional ( 3d ) calculation of the electronic band structure @xcite .",
    "when we compared the band structure calculations in the literature among themselves , we found that there is a certain disagreement on the exact description of the bands around the fermi level , e@xmath16 . to improve our results according to experiments and to the accepted information on the bands around the fermi level , we found it useful to fit our 3d _ ab initio _ bands to a tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "this allows us to slightly fine - tune our bands around the fermi level ( see below ) .",
    "we , next , calculate the optical conductivity , @xmath14 in the normal state for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 from the known kubo - greenwood formula @xcite and compare our result to experiment @xcite . for that purpose ,",
    "we have identified the electronic bands of the carriers associated to the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "we then perform the same calculation in the superconducting state . to simulate the superconducting state , we have introduced into the electronic band structure a superconducting gap to the bands that describe the carriers on the cuo@xmath0 plane and only to them .",
    "we perform the calculation using the same formula and our built up superconducting band structure .",
    "the resonance appears in the superconducting and only in the superconducting state , at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the gap that we used for the cuo@xmath0-plane carrier - bands ) .",
    "so we argue that the superconducting phase transition modifies effectively the electronic bands around the fermi level and that this feature opens several new channels for allowed transitions with energy transfer @xmath19 and thus produces the experimentally observed effect .",
    "we will show below how both the intra- and inter- band transitions are projected by the superconducting phase transition to the same energy @xmath20 a fact that explains the common origin of the resonance in both thermodynamic functions .",
    "the model that we present here has the advantage that , on exactly the same footing , accounts for several experimental results of different character @xcite .",
    "we will comment on this further below .",
    "we deal in this paper with yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "our model separates sharply the cause of the resonance from the cause of superconductivity as the infrared experiments @xcite indicate .",
    "the resonance arises from the effect that the superconducting transition ( the gap ) has on the electronic band structure but superconductivity ( the gap itself ) can arise by whatever mechanism .",
    "further , to the extend in which we can account for the resonance by taking only the gap value as the information on the superconducting state , it is clear that no information on the specific mechanism can be obtained from it .",
    "it appears that the resonance does not contain enough information on the superconducting mechanism to be useful to decide on it .",
    "the background is built up from the allowed transitions at energies different from @xmath5 .",
    "the physics that it contains is essentially the same .",
    "no information on the mechanism can be extracted from the background as well , since it appears that the main contribution to the optical conductivity comes from the optical allowed transitions determined by the electronic states around the fermi energy and by the influence that the superconducting phase transition ( solely through the gap value ) has on them .",
    "the background as a source of information on the mechanism has been suggested by hwang et al .",
    "@xcite solely on the basis that it is common to all htsc .",
    "it has been further emphasized by norman @xcite . as it appears to us",
    ", neither the resonance nor the background in the optical conductivity can be used effectively to decide on the mechanism of htsc .",
    "the situation seems not to be the same with the `` kink '' in the self - energy found in the arpes experiments @xcite .",
    "the kink does reveal a coupling and most probably is the key to the superconducting mechanism .",
    "_ @xcite have argued that the arpes experiments can be interpreted as supporting either spin - fluctuations or the phonon - mediated mechanism .",
    "they eliminate the possibility of a phonon - mediated mechanism on the basis that their own calculation of the optical conductivity assuming this mechanism gives a wrong dependence of this function at high frequencies .",
    "as we shall see below , our model gives the right high - frequency dependence of the optical conductivity .",
    "we do not assume any mechanism , we only introduce a detailed description of the electronic bands .",
    "it is far from being clear whether or not the phonons plays a role in htsc .",
    "nevertheless , in a recent work on the isotope effect , gweon _ et al . _",
    "_ suggest that the singlet pairing of electrons and the electron - lattice coupling mutually enhance each other . on the basis of our work as it stands no mechanism can be analysed .",
    "we go backwards in certain sense .",
    "we want to show how far one can go in describing the thermodynamics of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 by taking the attitude that the carriers have to be described in detail while superconductivity itself is described just by the gap value . in conventional superconductivity the details of the phonon spectrum",
    "are crucial while the descrition of the electrons enter just through the density of states at the fermi energy.we deal here with a particular experiment and with a particular htsc .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section 2",
    ", we present our electronic band structure and compare it with other work in tliterature .",
    "we also include at this point our description of the superconducting state . in section 3 ,",
    "we calculate the optical conductivity for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 in the normal and in the superconducting state and analyze our result . in section 4 , we show that our model leads directly to a suggestion for the approximate way in which the electronic band structure might develop around the fermi energy under doping for the observed property to emerge quite naturally ( the resonance disappears while superconductivity remains ) . in a last section 5 ,",
    "we put our model in perspective and draw our conclusions .",
    "we make at this point some experimental suggestions that might contribute to prove the usefulness of our model . in particular",
    ", we suggest that there is no reason for the two resonances to disappear at the same doping concentration .",
    "the `` kink '' in the arpes experiments should remain as long as the sample remains superconducting irrespective to whether it presents one , two or no - resonance at all would it be the key experiment to reveal the mechanism .",
    "the 3d - electronic band structure of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 has been calculated by different _ ab initio _ methods and by the tight - binding method @xcite . when we compare the different results in the literature , we find that there are differences",
    ". the exact position of the bands can differ in as much as 100 mev .",
    "these are important differences on the scale of mev which is the proper scale to describe the effect of the superconducting gap .",
    "we have first perform an _ ab initio _ lapw calculation of the normal - state electronic band structure using the wien97 code and the parameters of reference @xcite .",
    "we found useful to fit further our calculation to a tight - binding description as well to analyze some details of it @xcite .",
    "we have pet special attention to the description of the band near the fermi energy .",
    "some features of our final result are that we find the extended van hove singularity around the high symmetry point y @xcite at 14 mev below the fermi energy in agreement with experiment @xcite . below the fermi level",
    ", we also found a van hove singularity at about -200 mev at @xmath21 which has been reported in ref .",
    "the overall features of our calculation coincide well with the rest of the other works in the literature .",
    "we reproduce our result for the bands around the fermi energy in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this figure ,",
    "the bands labelled 1 and 4 belong to in - cuo - chain states while the 2 and 3 ones describe in - cuo@xmath7-plane states .",
    "notice that bands 2 and 3 that belong to the planes do not show a significantly different dispersion from * s - x * than they do from * s - y , * while bands 1 and 4 that belong to the chains do have a different dispersion . in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present the total density of states ( dos ) that we get from our band structure . we have obtained a very similar result by calculating it through the green s function @xcite or using the tetrahedral method of integration @xcite . in the lower part of the same figure ,",
    "we present the dos discriminated for each scenario ( planes , chains and c - axis ) . at the fermi level ,",
    "their relative contribution is 74% ( planes ) , 15% ( chains ) and 10% ( c - axis ) .",
    "the most important contribution comes by far from the cuo@xmath0-plane states as it is well known .      by whatever mechanism ,",
    "the superconducting transition has the effect of introducing a gap at the fermi energy , e@xmath16 , on the electronic states of the carriers affected by it . to simulate the superconducting phase transition , we have introduced by hand a constant gap , @xmath18 , into our normal - state electronic band structure to the bands near e@xmath16 that can be associated to electronic states that belong to the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "it is important to say at this point that this model allows us to reproduce right away the optical conductivity and the spin polarized susceptibility on exactly the same basis both in the superconducting and normal state ( @xmath22 . this point is important since , as we have already recall , these thermodynamic functions seem to exclude each other in the sense that the contributing transitions to their corresponding matrix elements are inter - band in the first case and intra - band in the second .",
    "we present the calculation of the spin magnetic susceptibility in detail elsewhere @xcite as well as the calculation of the tunnelling characteristics @xcite . here",
    "we merely want to say that these two results other results agree with the known experiments .",
    "we have introduced the gap into the electronic band structure in the way that is familiar in bcs theory @xcite .",
    "so , we have removed the bands that can be associated to the cuo@xmath0 plane from the energy interval ( e@xmath16-@xmath18 , e@xmath16+@xmath18 ) .",
    "the states above e@xmath16 accumulate at the upper edge of the interval and the ones below at the bottom .",
    "would we introduce the gap in another way ( d - symmetry , for example ) the result would differ noticeably from the experimental result .",
    "we discuss this point in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we introduced a gap only to the bands formed by electronic states that can be associated with the atoms belonging to the cuo@xmath0 plane . in this way we obtained what we call the `` superconducting electronic band structure '' for the cuo@xmath0 plane . in what follows",
    "we make use of our tight - binding fit to our own _ ab initio _ calculation to calculate the optical conductivity .",
    "the dielectric function , @xmath23 characterizes the optical properties of a material .",
    "experimentally it can be obtained from the reflectance spectrum .",
    "the real and imaginary part of it are related through the krammers - kronig relations .",
    "the imaginary part of the dielectric function is directly related to the optical conductivity as @xmath24 for inter - band transitions , we can calculate the optical conductivity from the _ kubo - greenwood _ formula @xcite @xmath25}\\delta(e_{l}% ( \\mathbf{k})-e_{n}(\\mathbf{k)-}h\\omega ) \\label{kubof}%\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the bloch function for the n - band and * k * is the wave vector defined in the first brillouin zone .",

    "fig [ fig3 ] ( bottom ) gives low - energy details ( 0 - 0.5 ev ) of the three tensors .",
    "there is a clear anisotropy at low energies between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "we have used our electronic band structure where a gap was inserted in the way described above .",
    "we allow only inter - band transitions on the in - cuo@xmath0-plane states .",
    "our result for @xmath56  in the normal and in the superconducting state appears in the next fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as we can see in this figure , the effect of the transition is to shift the spectral weight of the almost featureless @xmath57 function to higher energies , namely above 30 mev , producing the sharp resonance at 38 mev .",
    "this occurs because all the allowed transitions within bands ( one below and one above the fermi level ) that differ in the normal state by less than @xmath20 are projected in the superconducting state to the gap edges ( above and below e@xmath16 ) and the transition will take place at @xmath20 irrespective to the energy at which it occurs in the normal state .",
    "we have used @xmath58=19 mev for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "both , the calculation in the normal state and the one in the superconducting state , reproduce the experimental results .",
    "our model does not assume any mechanism whatsoever .",
    "therefore an interesting point that arises is that on quite general grounds , namely that the phase transition introduces a gap to the electronic band structure , the resonance can be reproduced .",
    "this fact casts some doubts on whether at all the optical conductivity has enough information to allow a sharp decision on the mechanism ( neither in the resonance nor in the background ) .",
    "a suggestion based on our model on how the effect of doping can cause the total disappearance of the resonance while the sample remains superconducting is sketched on fig .",
    "5 . let the band ( a ) contains a possible initial state ( i ) below the fermi energy , e@xmath16 ( dash - dot line ) .",
    "the energy difference between state ( i ) and e@xmath16 let it be less than the gap associated to the plane , @xmath58 ( dashed line ) . as the contributing transitions are inter - band , the final state has to lie on a different band ( b ) above the fermi level .",
    "the transitions are direct ( no momentum transfer ) . in the normal state",
    "this transition contributes to the resonance at a frequency equal to the energy difference between the final and the initial state . in the superconducting state ,",
    "this and several similar events will contribute as well but at an energy 2@xmath18 due to the effect that the superconducting transition has on the bands .",
    "it is enough that , upon doping , the bands evolve so that their energy difference in the normal state gets higher than 2@xmath18 at this particular point of the fbz where the transition occurs for this particular event to cease to contribute to the resonance .",
    "it will contribute at a higher energy and , consequently , the resonance will have one less event that contributes and its spectral weight diminishes .",
    "eventually the resonance disappears .",
    "it is obvious , on the other hand , that bands at certain doping that did not contribute at a previous one can contribute , but the net effect can be a lost of contributing events due to doping .",
    "the exact issue depends on the details of the bands and on the specific influence of the doping on them and on the value of the gap for each family of compounds and it has to be calculated in detail .",
    "we suggest that this is what happens in the bi - family @xcite where experiment shows the disappearance of the resonance with doping . under doping ,",
    "the gap shrinks at a slower pace than the number of events contributing to the resonance and , consequently , the resonance disappears but superconductivity remains .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the resonance in the optical conductivity that appears in the superconducting and only in the superconducting state can be obtained from an ab initio three dimensional calculation just by introducing to the electronic bands that can be associated to the cuo@xmath0 plane a gap , @xmath18 .",
    "the actual calculation of the optical conductivity is two - dimensional ( in - plane ) .",
    "the model produces the resonance at 2@xmath18 and therefore we have consequently introduced into the calculation @xmath59  to reproduce the resonance at the right experimental frequency .",
    "the curves agree very well with experiment in the normal and the superconducting state .",
    "it is interesting that we get the experimental trend of the function at high frequency both in the normal and in the superconducting state .",
    "we do not assume any mechanism in our calculation .",
    "we have further suggested a way in which this model can account for the experimental results on the effect of doping on the intensity of the resonance @xcite .",
    "it is important to say that using exactly the same model , we have calculate the spin polarized susceptibility in the normal and in the superconducting state and reproduce the experimental results .",
    "we obtain that this resonance could disappear as well but that there is no reason for it to disappear at the same doping level than the one in the optical conductivity @xcite .",
    "the model does not reproduce the experimental results for the tunneling experiments unless it is extended to three dimensions .",
    "if we impose further to the 3d bands obtained from our ab initio calculation , an additional gap to the states that can be associated to the chains ( @xmath60 and keep @xmath61 for the bands that can be associated to the c - axis , we reproduce the tunnelling characteristics in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "a somehow similar approach in the sense that they used a different value for the gap on each scenario ( planes , chains and c - axis ) has been used before @xcite to simulate successfully experimental results on tunnelling , specific heat and ultrasonic attenuation . on that basis",
    "we expect to reproduce these two last results as well from our more detailed model .",
    "a more delicate point is to reproduce the temperature behavior of the resonance .",
    "the resonance frequency hardly changes in the range from zero to the superconducting temperature but , on the contrary , its intensity is very sensitive to it , decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes steeply at t@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we will suggest that this is a combined effect of the behavior of the superconducting gap with temperature and the separate effect of the increasing temperature on the electronic band structure.itself .",
    "the effect of temperature on the electronic bands itself has never been considered before in this context but within the critical temperature range ( @xmath6100 k @xmath6 10 mev ) also the temperature itself could have a non - negligible effect on the electronic band structure at the mev scale .",
    "calculations of this effect in metals like cu and ni have been made in the past by delgadillo _",
    "they find that the electronic bands around the fermi level do displace themselves as an effect of temperature in the mev scale.this fact and the known temperature dependence of the superconducting gap itself might explain ( always within the same model ) the behavior of the resonance with temperature .",
    "notice that 10 mev , is of the order of @xmath62 , where @xmath18 is the superconducting gap associated to the cuo@xmath0 plane @xcite .",
    "the goal of the work presented in this and some other papers is to show how far one can go in describing the experimental results starting from what could be said `` the result '' of a theory of superconductivity for high - tc superconductors .",
    "one possible conclusion is that the detailed description of the carriers plays an important role in htsc a fact that is in sharp contrast with conventional superconductivity where the electronic band structure characteristics enter merely through the density of states at the fermi energy . as we atated above .",

    "<S> but the most important conclusion is that the background contains essentially the same physics as the resonance does and so does not have any detailed information on the superconducting mechanism as well , contrary to the conclusions of recent work . </S>"
