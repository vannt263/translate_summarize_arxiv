    "in the last decade trapped yb^+^ ions have been a workhorse in the fields of quantum information processing @xcite , precision measurements @xcite and hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "yb@xmath0 has a rich energy level structure because besides pure valence - electron excitations , also electrons from a closed f - shell can be excited .",
    "this leads to unusual features such as the electric octupole transition @xmath2s@xmath11-@xmath2f@xmath12 , which is currently explored for the prospect of an ion based atomic clock , as it has a natural lifetime of several years @xcite .    since the work of @xcite , a common feature of most trapped yb^+^ experiments is the continuous excitation of the ion within a four level system ( figure [ ybion_terms_spec ] ) .",
    "the ion is cooled and detected on the @xmath2s@xmath11-@xmath2p@xmath3 transition near 369 nm .",
    "a second decay channel to the metastable @xmath2d@xmath13 state necessitates a second laser to avoid interruptions of the fluorescence .",
    "light near 935 nm repopulates the ground state via the @xmath5d@xmath6_{1/2}$ ]  state .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the available laser manipulation toolbox for trapped yb^+^ ions by exciting the 4f@xmath16s  @xmath2s@xmath3  -  4f@xmath45d6s  @xmath5d@xmath6_{1/2}$ ] transition at 297 nm .",
    "we perform laser spectroscopy and present frequency measurements for four isotopes .",
    "the isotope shifts contain information about the change of the charge distribution within the nucleus and about the correlations of electrons , which are intricate because of a partially filled f - shell in yb^+^. therefore they can be used to test ab - initio calculations .",
    "in addition , we show that the 297 nm light can be used as second the step in the photoionization process of neutral yb as well as for laser cooling of single yb^+^ ions",

    "the electrodes are formed from tungsten wire of 250 @xmath16 m diameter and are etched to a needle - like geometry @xcite . by applying a radio frequency signal of 20 mhz and a few hundred volts amplitude , the ion is trapped with secular trap frequencies of @xmath17  mhz and @xmath18  mhz .",
    "single ions are loaded into the trap by two - step photoionization from a thermal atomic beam @xcite . a stainless steel tube filled with yb is resistively heated by a short current pulse ( typically 60 - 80  ms , 60  a ) and emits neutral yb atoms into the trap",
    ". the atoms are resonantly excited on the @xmath19s@xmath20-@xmath19p@xmath21 transition with laser light at 398  nm and subsequently ionized by a laser at 369  nm .",
    "the first excitation step is isotope selective .",
    "after ionization , the ion is continuously laser cooled on the @xmath2s@xmath11-@xmath2p@xmath3 transition and the resulting fluorescence is collected by an in - vacuum objective and detected by a photomultiplier tube .    the laser system for exciting the @xmath2s@xmath3-@xmath5d@xmath6_{1/2}$ ] transition at 297  nm is based on sum frequency generation ( sfg ) of light at 532  nm and 672  nm .",
    "the sketch of the optical setup is shown in figure [ green_setup ] .",
    "the green 532  nm laser is a commercial system ( coherent verdi  v6 ) , whereas the red 672  nm diode laser with subsequent amplification stage is homebuilt . in order to supply an atomic frequency reference ,",
    "the green laser is stabilized to the r(56)32 - 0 transition in molecular iodine @xcite .",
    "as the study of isotope shifts in yb^+^ requires a large frequency scan range , we use the doppler broadened absorption line ( at room temperature : line width @xmath22  ghz ) and generate an error signal by fm spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we measured the rms frequency fluctuations of the green laser to be about 20  mhz .",
    "we achieve type - i ( ooe ) sfg in a doubly resonant bow - tie cavity ( finesse : 75 , free spectral range : @xmath23  ghz ) .",
    "the cavity length is locked to the 532  nm laser using the hnsch - couillaud stabilization technique @xcite , whereas the 672  nm laser follows the sfg cavity by the pound - drever - hall locking technique @xcite . by sweeping the green 532  nm laser we can scan the generated uv light continuously about 1  ghz .",
    "input light intensities of 1  w  ( 532  nm ) and 300  mw ( 672  nm ) yield about 10  mw of 297  nm light .",
    "spectroscopy on the transition is performed in a double - resonance scheme .",
    "the laser at 369  nm cools the ion continuously on the transition and yields fluorescence , which is detected .",
    "simultaneously , the 297  nm probe laser excites the transition .",
    "additional 935  nm light is necessary to deplete the population of the state . by sweeping the frequency of the 297  nm light ,",
    "the resonance is observed as a drop in the 369 nm fluorescence ( figure [ typicalspec ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the saturation parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , with the ( saturation ) intensity @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) ) is important for the strength of the observed signal . for @xmath29 the excitation into the @xmath5d@xmath6_{1/2}$ ] is much slower than the probing of the @xmath2s@xmath3 state due to the 369  nm laser , which effectively suppresses the transition to @xmath5d@xmath6_{1/2}$ ] in a quantum zeno like manner .",
    "in contrast , the signal of the 369  nm @xmath2s@xmath11-@xmath2p@xmath3 fluorescence shows a significant drop for similar saturation parameters @xmath30 .",
    "the steady state fluorescence is proportional to the population of the @xmath2p@xmath3 state , which is given by    @xmath31    assuming fast repumping out of the @xmath2d@xmath13 state and neglecting coherences . here",
    "@xmath32 is the detuning of the 369  nm laser and @xmath33 the natural line width of the @xmath2p@xmath3 state .",

    "this results in a 20@xmath39 - 30% drop of the fluorescence , which is consistent with our measured spectra .",
    "we typically scan the 297  nm light 400  mhz in 10  s and record the 369  nm fluorescence .",
    "the line width of the 297  nm laser , residual micromotion and the continuous driving of the transition broaden the linewidth , which is measured to be 40  mhz .",
    "the absolute frequency is determined by measuring the frequency of the 532  nm and the 672  nm laser with a wave meter ( highfinesse  ws/07 ) .",
    "the wave meter is calibrated to the d@xmath40 ( f@xmath41 , f@xmath42 ) crossover line in @xmath43rb and has a specified 3-@xmath44 accuracy of 60  mhz . in this manner we measured the frequencies for the isotopes @xmath7yb@xmath0 , @xmath8yb@xmath0 , @xmath9yb^+^ and @xmath10yb^+^ ( table [ tablefreq ] ) .",

    "@xcite , who investigated a similar line in neutral yb , namely the 4f@xmath16s@xmath2  @xmath19s@xmath45 to 4f@xmath45d6s@xmath2  @xmath19p@xmath46 transition .",
    "they found a similarly large negative specific mass shift , which is explained by the strong coupling of d- and f - electrons @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our measured field shift is about 50% higher .",
    "this may reflect the fact that , in general the electron charge density at the nucleus is higher in ionic systems than in their neutral counterparts and thereby more sensitive to changes of the charge distribution within the nucleus .",
    "photoionization of yb can be achieved by a photon at 398  nm ( @xmath19s@xmath20-@xmath19p@xmath21 transition ) and a second photon with a wavelength smaller than 394  nm . here",
    "we demonstrate that light at 297  nm can be used for the second step . at the beginning of the loading sequence",
    "the yb oven is heated for 75  ms and simultaneously the 398  nm , the 297  nm and the 935  nm laser lights are switched on .",
    "after three seconds the light at 398  nm is turned off and one second later the 369  nm laser illuminates the ion and the resulting fluorescence is recorded ( figure [ loading ] ) .",
    "we note that for reliable loading the oven heating time needs to be slightly longer compared to the standard loading with 369 nm light .",
    "blue line : expected fluorescence of an 100  k hot ion @xcite .",
    "black curve : sweep of @xmath47 from -200  mhz to -60  mhz in 3 s after heating the oven leads to a high initial level of 369 nm fluorescence indicating a cold ion . in both cases @xmath48 . ]    the fluorescence curve after switching on the 369  nm light depends strongly on the kinetic energy of the ion due to the doppler shift and can be used to determine its temperature @xcite . in order to measure the onset of the fluorescence",
    ", we interrupt the 935  nm light 10  ms before the 369  nm light is switched on .",
    "this allows the 369  nm intensity controller to adjust without affecting the ion .",
    "we switch the 935  nm light back on 100  ms later . only with both lights ,",
    "935  nm and 369  nm , the excitation cycle is closed and the ion continuously scatters photons .",
    "the inset in figure [ loading ] shows the onset of the fluorescence for two different loading sequences . in the first the 297  nm laser",
    "is set 400  mhz below the resonance frequency during the loading ( yellow curve ) . because of the large detuning the ion scatters only few photons on the @xmath2s@xmath3-@xmath5d@xmath6_{1/2}$ ] transition and the cooling of the ion is very inefficient .",
    "thus , the 369  nm fluorescence starts low due to doppler broadening and increases as the 369  nm laser cools the ion . in the second loading sequence , a smooth shifting of the 297  nm laser frequency towards the resonance ( from @xmath49  mhz to @xmath50  mhz ) in the first three seconds after photoionization yields a photon scatter rate , which starts immediately at its saturation value and hence indicates a cold ion ( black curve )",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated laser spectroscopy , photoionization and laser cooling of a single yb@xmath0 ion on the 4f@xmath16s @xmath2s@xmath3 - 4f@xmath45d6s @xmath5d@xmath6_{1/2}$ ] transition .",
    "we measure the isotope shifts and determine the specific mass shift as well as the field shifts .",
    "the results on loading - and - cooling show that this transition complements the existing manipulation capabilities of yb@xmath0 ions and potentially could replace the @xmath2s@xmath3-@xmath2p@xmath3 transition . in the future , we plan to make use of the relatively narrow line width of this transition to facilitate doppler cooling to very low temperatures , potentially directly into the vibrational ground state .",
    "moreover , the new availability of a @xmath51-system in yb@xmath0 will allow for new ways of quantum state manipulation and , for example , eit cooling @xcite .",
