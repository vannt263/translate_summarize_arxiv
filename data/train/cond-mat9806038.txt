    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) ( bose , 1924 ; einstein , 1924 ) was observed in 1995 in a remarkable series of experiments on vapors of rubidium ( anderson _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) and sodium ( davis _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) in which the atoms were confined in magnetic traps and cooled down to extremely low temperatures , of the order of fractions of microkelvins .",
    "the first evidence for condensation emerged from time of flight measurements .",
    "the atoms were left to expand by switching off the confining trap and then imaged with optical methods .",
    "a sharp peak in the velocity distribution was then observed below a certain critical temperature , providing a clear signature for bec . in fig .",
    "[ fig : threepeaks ] , we show one of the first pictures of the atomic clouds of rubidium . in the same year , first signatures of the occurrence of bec in vapors of lithium were also reported ( bradley _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) .",
    "though the experiments of 1995 on the alkalis should be considered a milestone in the history of bec , the experimental and theoretical research on this unique phenomenon predicted by quantum statistical mechanics is much older and has involved different areas of physics ( for an interdisciplinary review of bec see griffin , snoke and stringari , 1995 ) . in particular , from the very beginning , superfluidity in helium was considered by london ( 1938 ) as a possible manifestation of bec .",
    "evidences for bec in helium have later emerged from the analysis of the momentum distribution of the atoms measured in neutron scattering experiments ( sokol , 1995 ) . in recent years",
    ", bec has been also investigated in the gas of paraexcitons in semiconductors ( see wolfe , lin and snoke , 1995 , and references therein ) , but an unambiguous signature for bec in this system has proven difficult to find .",
    "efforts to bose condense atomic gases began with hydrogen more than 15 years ago . in a series of experiments hydrogen atoms",
    "were first cooled in a dilution refrigerator , then trapped by a magnetic field and further cooled by evaporation .",
    "this approach has come very close to observing bec , but is still limited by recombination of individual atoms to form molecules ( silvera and walraven , 1980 and 1986 ; greytak and kleppner , 1984 ; greytak , 1995 ; silvera , 1995 ) . at the time of this review , first observations of bec in spin polarized hydrogen have been reported ( fried _ et al .",
    ". in the 80s laser - based techniques , such as laser cooling and magneto - optical trapping , were developed to cool and trap neutral atoms [ for recent reviews , see chu ( 1998 ) , cohen - tannoudji ( 1998 ) and phillips ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "alkali atoms are well suited to laser - based methods because their optical transitions can be excited by available lasers and because they have a favourable internal energy - level structure for cooling to very low temperatures .",
    "once they are trapped , their temperature can be lowered further by evaporative cooling [ this technique has been recently reviewed by ketterle and van druten ( 1996a ) and by walraven ( 1996 ) ] . by combining laser and evaporative cooling for alkali atoms ,",
    "experimentalists eventually succeeded in reaching the temperatures and densities required to observe bec .",
    "it is worth noticing that , in these conditions , the equilibrium configuration of the system would be the solid phase .",
    "thus , in order to observe bec , one has to preserve the system in a metastable gas phase for a sufficiently long time .",
    "this is possible because three - body collisions are rare events in dilute and cold gases , whose lifetime is hence long enough to carry out experiments .",
    "so far bec has been realized in @xmath0rb ( anderson _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ; han _ et al . _ , 1998 ; kasevich , 1997 ; ernst _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998a ; esslinger _",
    "et al . _ , 1998 ; dalibard _ et al . _ , 1998 ) , in @xmath1na ( davis _ et al . _ , 1995 ; hau , 1997 and 1998 ; lutwak _ et al . _ , 1998 ) and in @xmath2li ( bradley _ et al . _ , 1995 and 1997 ) .",
    "the number of experiments on bec in vapors of rubidium and sodium is now growing fast . in",
    "the meanwhile , intense experimental research is currently carried out also on vapors of caesium , potassium and metastable helium .",
    "one of the most relevant features of these trapped bose gases is that they are inhomogeneous and finite - sized systems , the number of atoms ranging typically from a few thousands to several millions . in most cases ,",
    "the confining traps are well approximated by harmonic potentials .",
    "the trapping frequency , @xmath3 , provides also a characteristic length scale for the system , @xmath4^{1/2}$ ] , of the order of a few microns in the available samples .",
    "density variations occur on this scale .",
    "this is a major difference with respect to other systems , like for instance superfluid helium , where the effects of inhomogeneity take place on a microscopic scale fixed by the interatomic distance . in the case of @xmath0rb and @xmath1na , the size of the system",
    "is enlarged as an effect of repulsive two - body forces and the trapped gases can become almost macroscopic objects , directly measurable with optical methods . as an example , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : insitu ] a sequence of  in situ \" images of an oscillating condensate of sodium atoms taken at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) , where the mean axial extent is of the order of @xmath5 mm .",
    "the fact that these gases are highly inhomogeneous has several important consequences .",
    "first bec shows up not only in _",
    "space , as happens in superfluid helium , but also in _ co - ordinate _ space .",
    "this double possibility of investigating the effects of condensation is very interesting from both the theoretical and experimental viewpoints and provides novel methods of investigation for relevant quantities , like the temperature dependence of the condensate , energy and density distributions , interference phenomena , frequencies of collective excitations , and so on .",
    "another important consequence of the inhomogeneity of these systems is the role played by two - body interactions .",
    "this aspect will be extensively discussed in the present review .",
    "the main point is that , despite the very dilute nature of these gases ( typically the average distance between atoms is more than ten times the range of interatomic forces ) , the combination of bec and harmonic trapping greatly enhances the effects of the atom - atom interactions on important measurable quantities . for instance , the central density of the interacting gas at very low temperature can be easily one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the density predicted for an ideal gas in the same trap , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hau ] . despite the inhomogeneity of these systems , which makes the solution of the many - body problem nontrivial",
    ", the dilute nature of the gas allows one to describe the effects of the interaction in a rather fundamental way . in practice a single physical parameter ,",
    "the @xmath6-wave scattering length , is sufficient to obtain an accurate description .",
    "the recent experimental achievements of bec in alkali vapors have renewed a great interest in the theoretical studies of bose gases .",
    "a rather massive amount of work has been done in the last couple of years , both to interpret the initial observations and to predict new phenomena . in the presence of harmonic confinement ,",
    "the many - body theory of interacting bose gases gives rise to several unexpected features .",
    "this opens new theoretical perspectives in this interdisciplinary field , where useful concepts coming from different areas of physics ( atomic physics , quantum optics , statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics ) are now merging together .",
    "the natural starting point for studying the behavior of these systems is the theory of weakly interacting bosons which , for inhomogeneous systems , takes the form of the gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "this is a mean - field approach for the order parameter associated with the condensate .",
    "it provides closed and relatively simple equations for describing the relevant phenomena associated with bec . in particular , it reproduces typical properties exhibited by superfluid systems , like the propagation of collective excitations and the interference effects originating from the phase of the order parameter . the theory is well suited to describing most of the effects of two - body interactions in these dilute gases at zero temperature and can be naturally generalized to explore also thermal effects .",
    "an extensive discussion of the application of mean - field theory to these systems is the main basis of the present review article .",
    "we also give , whenever possible , simple arguments based on scales of length , energy and density , in order to point out the relevant parameters for the description of the various phenomena .",
    "there are several topics which are only marginally discussed in our paper .",
    "these include , among others , collisional and thermalization processes , phase diffusion phenomena , light scattering from the condensate and analogies with systems of coherent photons . in this sense",
    "our work is complementary to other recent review articles ( burnett , 1996 ; parkins and walls , 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore in our paper we do not discuss the physics of ultracold collisions and the determination of the scattering length which have been recently the object of important experimental and theoretical studies in the alkalis ( heinzen , 1997 ; weiner _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following :    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theidealgas ] we summarize the basic features of the noninteracting bose gas in harmonic traps and we introduce the first relevant length and energy scales , like the oscillator length and the critical temperature .",
    "we also comment on finite size effects , on the role of dimensionality and on the possible relevance of anharmonic traps .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : groundstate ] we discuss the effects of the interaction on the ground state .",
    "we develop the formalism of mean - field theory , based on the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we consider the case of gases interacting with both repulsive and attractive forces .",
    "we then discuss in detail the large @xmath7 limit for systems interacting with repulsive forces , leading to the so called thomas - fermi approximation , where the ground state properties can be calculated in analytic form . in the last part",
    ", we discuss the validity of the mean - field approach and give explicit results for the first corrections , beyond mean - field , to the ground state properties , including the quantum depletion of the condensate , _",
    "i.e. _ , the decrease in the condensate fraction produced by the interaction .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] we investigate the dynamic behavior of the condensate using the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the equations of motion for the density and the velocity field of the condensate in the large @xmath7 limit , where the thomas - fermi approximation is valid , are shown to have the form of the hydrodynamic equations of superfluids .",
    "we also discuss the dynamic behavior in the nonlinear regime ( large amplitude oscillations and free expansion ) , the collective modes in the case of attractive forces and the transition from collective to single - particle states in the spectrum of excitations .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermodynamics ] we discuss thermal effects .",
    "we show how one can define the thermodynamic limit in these inhomogeneous systems and how interactions modify the behavior compared to the noninteracting case .",
    "we extensively discuss the occurrence of scaling properties in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we review several results for the shift of the critical temperature and for the temperature dependence of thermodynamic functions , like the condensate fraction , the chemical potential and the release energy .",
    "we also discuss the behavior of the excitations at finite temperature .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : superfluidity ] we illustrate some features of these trapped bose gases in connection with superfluidity and phase coherence .",
    "we discuss in particular the structure of quantized vortices and the behavior of the moment of inertia , as well as interference phenomena and quantum effects beyond mean - field theory , like the collapse - revival of collective oscillations .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions and we discuss some further future perspectives in the field .",
    "the overlap between current theoretical and experimental investigations of bec in trapped alkalis is already wide and rich . various theoretical predictions , concerning the ground state ,",
    "dynamics and thermodynamics are found to agree very well with observations ; others are stimulating new experiments .",
    "the comparison between theory and experiments then represents an exciting feature of these novel systems , which will be frequently emphasized in the present review .",
    "an important feature characterizing the available magnetic traps for alkali atoms is that the confining potential can be safely approximated with the quadratic form @xmath8 thus the investigation of these systems starts as a textbook application of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics for identical point - like particles in a harmonic potential .",
    "the first step consists in neglecting the atom - atom interaction . in this case , almost all predictions are analytical and relatively simple .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian is the sum of single - particle hamiltonians whose eigenvalues have the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 are non - negative integers .",
    "the ground state @xmath11 of @xmath7 noninteracting bosons confined by the potential ( [ eq : uext ] ) is obtained by putting all the particles in the lowest single - particle state ( @xmath12 ) , namely @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is given by @xmath15   \\ ; , \\label{eq : gaussian}\\ ] ] and we have introduced the geometric average of the oscillator frequencies : @xmath16 the density distribution then becomes @xmath17 and its value grows with @xmath7 .",
    "the size of the cloud is instead independent of @xmath7 and is fixed by the harmonic oscillator length @xmath18 which corresponds to the average width of the gaussian ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) .",
    "this is the first important length scale of the system . in the available experiments , it is typically of the order of @xmath19 @xmath20 m . at finite temperature only part of the atoms",
    "occupy the lowest state , the others being thermally distributed in the excited states at higher energy .",
    "the radius of the thermal cloud is larger than @xmath21 .",
    "a rough estimate can be obtained by assuming @xmath22 and approximating the density of the thermal cloud with a classical boltzmann distribution @xmath23 $ ] . if @xmath24 , the width of the gaussian is @xmath25 , and hence larger than @xmath21 .",
    "the use of a bose distribution function does not change significantly this estimate .",
    "the above discussion reveals that bose - einstein condensation in harmonic traps shows up with the appearance of a sharp peak in the central region of the density distribution .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s - peak ] , where we plot the prediction for the condensate and thermal densities of @xmath26 noninteracting particles in a spherical trap at a temperature @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the temperature at which condensation occurs ( see discussion in the next section ) .",
    "the curves correspond to the column density , namely the particle density integrated along one direction , @xmath29 ; this is a typical measured quantity , the @xmath30 direction being the direction of the light beam used to image the atomic cloud . by plotting directly the density @xmath31 , the ratio of the condensed and noncondensed densities at the center would be even larger .    by taking the fourier transform of the ground state wave function",
    ", one can also calculate the momentum distribution of the atoms in the condensate .",
    "for the ideal gas , it is given by a gaussian centered at zero momentum and having a width proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "the distribution of the thermal cloud is , also in momentum space , broader . using a classical distribution function",
    "one finds that the width is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "actually , the momentum distributions of the condensed and noncondensed particles of an ideal gas in harmonic traps have exactly the same form as the density distributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s - peak ] .",
    "the appearence of the condensate as a narrow peak in both co - ordinate and momentum space is a peculiar feature of trapped bose gases having important consequences in both the experimental and theoretical analysis .",
    "this is different from the case of a uniform gas where the particles condense into a state of zero momentum , but bec can not be revealed in co - ordinate space , since the condensed and noncondensed particles fill the same volume .",
    "indeed , the condensate has been detected experimentally as the occurrence of a sharp peak over a broader distribution , in both the velocity and spatial distributions . in the first case ,",
    "one lets the condensate expand freely , by switching - off the trap , and measures the density of the expanded cloud with light absorption ( anderson _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) .",
    "if the particles do not interact , the expansion is ballistic and the imaged spatial distribution of the expanding cloud can be directly related to the initial momentum distribution . in the second case , one measures directly the density of the atoms in the trap by means of dispersive light scattering ( andrews _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) . in both cases , the appearence of a sharp peak is the main signature of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "an important theoretical task consists of predicting how the shape of these peaks is modified by the inclusion of two - body interactions . as anticipated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hau ] , the interactions can change the picture drastically .",
    "this effect will be deeply discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : groundstate ] .",
    "the shape of the confining field fixes also the symmetry of the problem .",
    "one can use spherical or axially symmetric traps , for instance .",
    "the first experiments on rubidium and sodium were carried out with axial symmetry . in this case",
    "one can define an axial co - ordinate @xmath36 and a radial co - ordinate @xmath37 and the corresponding frequencies , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the ratio between the axial and radial frequencies , @xmath40 , fixes the asymmetry of the trap . for @xmath41",
    "the trap is cigar - shaped while for @xmath42 is disk - shaped . in terms of @xmath43 the ground state ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) for noninteracting bosons can be rewritten as @xmath44 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : gaussian - lambda}\\ ] ] here @xmath45 is the harmonic oscillator length in the @xmath30-@xmath46 plane and , since @xmath47 , one has also @xmath48 .",
    "the choice of an axially symmetric trap has proven useful for providing further evidence of bose - einstein condensation from the analysis of the momentum distribution . to understand this point ,",
    "let us take the fourier transform of the wave function ( [ eq : gaussian - lambda ] ) : @xmath49 $ ] . from this one can calculate the average axial and radial widths .",
    "their ratio , @xmath50 is fixed by the asymmetry parameter of the trap .",
    "thus , the shape of the expanded cloud in the @xmath30-@xmath36 plane is an ellipse , the ratio between the two axis ( _ aspect ratio _ ) being equal to @xmath51 .",
    "if the particles , instead of being in the lowest state ( condensate ) , were thermally distributed among many eigenstates at higher energy , their distribution function would be isotropic in momentum space , according to the equipartition principle , and the aspect ratio would be equal to @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , the occurrence of anisotropy in the condensate peak has been interpreted from the very beginning as an important signature of bec ( anderson _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ; davis _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ; mewes _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996a ) . in the case of the experiment at the joint institute for laboratory astrophysics ( jila ) in boulder ,",
    "the trap is disk - shaped with @xmath53 .",
    "the first measured value of the aspect ratio was about @xmath54%   larger than the prediction , @xmath51 , of the noninteracting model ( anderson _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) .",
    "of course , a quantitative comparison can be obtained only including the atom - atom interaction , which affects the dynamics of the expansion ( holland and cooper , 1996 ; dalfovo and stringari , 1996 ; holland _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; dalfovo _ et al .",

    "the population of the lowest state becomes macroscopic and this corresponds to the onset of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the calculation of the critical temperature , the fraction of particles in the lowest state ( condensate fraction ) and the other thermodynamic quantities , starts from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bosedistribution ] ) and ( [ eq : etotho ] ) with the appropriate spectrum @xmath59 ( de groot , hooman and ten seldam , 1950 ; bagnato , pritchard and kleppner , 1987 ) .",
    "indeed the statistical mechanics of these trapped gases is less trivial than expected at first sight .",
    "several interesting problems arise from the fact that these systems have a finite size and are inhomogeneous .",
    "for example , the usual definition of thermodynamic limit ( increasing @xmath7 and volume with the average density kept constant ) is not appropriate for trapped gases .",
    "moreover the traps can be made very anisotropic , reaching the limit of quasi-2d and quasi-1d systems , so that interesting effects of reduced dimensionality can be also investigated .",
    "as in the case of a uniform bose gas , it is convenient to separate out the lowest eigenvalue @xmath60 from the sum ( [ eq : bosedistribution ] ) and call @xmath61 the number of particles in this state .",
    "this number can be macroscopic , i.e. , of the order of @xmath7 , when the chemical potential becomes equal to the energy of the lowest state , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the arithmetic average of the trapping frequencies . inserting this value in the rest of the sum",

    "\\label{eq : nminusn0semiclassical}\\ ] ] this assumption corresponds to a semiclassical description of the excited states .",
    "its validity implies that the relevant excitation energies , contributing to the sum ( [ eq : nminusn0 ] ) , are much larger than the level spacing fixed by the oscillator frequencies .",
    "the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation ( [ eq : nminusn0semiclassical ] ) is expected to be good if the number of trapped atoms is large and @xmath67 .",
    "it can be tested _ a posteriori _ by comparing the integral ( [ eq : nminusn0semiclassical ] ) with the numerical summation ( [ eq : nminusn0 ] ) .",
    "the integral ( [ eq : nminusn0semiclassical ] ) can be easily calculated by changing variables ( @xmath68 , etc . ) .",
    "one finds @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the riemann @xmath71-function and @xmath3 is the geometric average ( [ omegaho ] ) . from this result",
    "one can also obtain the transition temperature for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "in fact , by imposing that @xmath72 at the transition , one gets @xmath73 for temperatures higher than @xmath28 the chemical potential is less than @xmath74 and becomes @xmath7-dependent , while the population of the lowest state is of the order of @xmath52 instead of @xmath7 .",

    "the transition temperature ( [ eq : tcho ] ) is well defined in the thermodynamic limit . inserting the above expression for @xmath28 into eq .",

    "however , as we will see later on , its value depends significantly on the atom - atom interaction and shall consequently provide a third important scale of energy .",
    "the noninteracting harmonic oscillator model has guided experimentalists to the proper value of the critical temperature .",
    "in fact , the measured transition temperature was found to be very close to the ideal gas value ( [ eq : tcho ] ) , the occupation of the condensate becoming macroscopically large below the critical temperature as predicted by ( [ eq : condfractioho ] ) . as an example , in fig .",

    "similar results have been obtained also at mit ( mewes _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996a ) .",
    "apart from problems related to temperature calibration , a more quantitative comparison between theory and experiments requires the inclusion of two main effects : the fact that these gases have a finite number of particles and that they are interacting .",

    ", the thermodynamic limit is never reached exactly .",
    "a first effect is the lack of discontinuities in the thermodynamic functions .",
    "hence bose - einstein condensation in these trapped gases is not , strictly speaking , a phase transition . in practice",
    ", however , the macroscopic occupation of the lowest state occurs rather abruptly as temperature is lowered and can be observed , as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : condfrac - exp ] .",
    "the transition is actually rounded with respect to the predictions of the @xmath113 limit , but this effect , though interesting , is small enough to make the words _ transition _ and _ critical temperature _ meaningful even for finite - sized systems .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , instead of being a limitation , the fact that @xmath7 is finite makes the system potentially richer , because new interesting regimes can be explored even in cases where there is no real phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "this can be seen by noting that , for an ideal gas in the presence of bec , the chemical potential vanishes and the momentum distribution , @xmath129^{-1}$ ] , exhibits an infrared @xmath130 divergence . in the thermodynamic limit , this yields a divergent contribution to the integral @xmath131 in 2d and 1d , thereby violating the normalization condition .",
    "the absence of bec in 1d and 2d can be also proven for interacting uniform systems , as shown by hohenberg ( 1967 ) .    in the presence of harmonic trapping ,",
    "the effects of thermal fluctuations are strongly quenched due to the different behavior exhibited by the density of states @xmath81 .",

    ", one should choose the frequency @xmath38 in the third direction large enough to satisfy the condition @xmath139 ; this implies rather severe conditions on the deformation of the trap .",
    "the main features of bec in 2d gases confined in harmonic traps and , in particular , the applicability of the hohenberg theorem and of its extensions to nonuniform gases , have been discussed in details by mullin ( 1997 ) .    in 1d",
    "the situation is also very interesting . in this case",
    ", bose - einstein condensation can not occur even in the presence of harmonic confinement because of the logarithmic divergence in the integral ( [ eq : nminusn0rho ] ) .",
    "this means that the critical temperature for 1d bose - einstein condensation tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit if one keeps the product @xmath140 fixed .",
    "in fact , in 1d the critical temperature for the ideal bose gas can be estimated to be ( ketterle and van druten , 1996b ) @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "despite the fact that one can not have bec in the thermodynamic limit , nevertheless for finite values of @xmath7 the system can exhibit a large occupation of the lowest single - particle state in a useful interval of temperatures .",
    "furthermore , if the value of @xmath7 and the parameters of the trap are chosen in a proper way , one observes a new interesting phenomenon associated with the macroscopic occupation of the lowest energy state , taking place in two distinct steps ( van druten and ketterle , 1997 ) .",
    "this happens when the relevant parameters of the trap satisfy simultaneously the conditions @xmath143 and @xmath144 , where @xmath145 coincides with the usual critical temperature given in eq .",

    "an example of this two - step bec is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twostep ] .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the conditions for the occurrence of two - step condensation in harmonic potentials are peculiar of the 1d geometry .",
    "in fact , it is easy to check that the corresponding conditions @xmath149 and @xmath150 , which would yield two - step bec in 2d , can not be easily satisfied because of the absence of the @xmath151 factor .",
    "it is finally worth pointing out that the above discussion concerns the behavior of the ideal bose gas .",
    "effects of two - body interactions are expected to modify in a deep way the nature of the phase transition in reduced dimensionality . in particular , interacting bose systems exhibit the well known berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless transition in 2d ( berezinsky , 1971 ; kosterlitz and thouless , 1973 ) . the case of trapped gases in 2d has been recently discussed by mullin ( 1998 ) and is expected to become an important issue in future investigations .      a crucial step to reach the low temperatures needed for bec in the experiments realized so far is evaporative cooling .",
    "this technique is intrinsically irreversible since it is based on the loss of hot particles from the trap .",
    "new interesting perspectives would open if one could adiabatically cool the system in a reversible way ( ketterle and pritchard , 1992 ; pinkse _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ) .",
    "reversible cooling of the gas is achieved by adiabatically changing the shape of the trap at a rate slow compared to the internal equilibration rate .    an important class of trapping potentials for studying the effects of adiabatic changes is provided by power - law potentials of the form @xmath152 where , for simplicity , we assume spherical symmetry .",
    "the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation in the trap ( [ eq : upl ] ) has been calculated by bagnato , pritchard and kleppner ( 1987 ) and is given by @xmath153^{1 \\over ( 3/2+\\delta ) } \\;. \\label{eq : tcpl}\\ ] ] here we have introduced the parameter @xmath154 , while @xmath155 is the usual gamma function . by setting @xmath156 and @xmath157 , one recovers the result for the transition temperature in an isotropic harmonic trap .",

    "it is straightforward to work out the thermodynamics of a noninteracting gas in the confining potential ( [ eq : upl ] ) ( bagnato , pritchard and kleppner , 1987 ; pinkse _ et al .",

    "more relevant to the discussion of reversible processes is the entropy which remains constant during the adiabatic change . above @xmath160",
    "the system can be approximated by a classical maxwell - boltzmann gas and the entropy per particle takes the simple form @xmath161 from this equation one sees that the entropy depends on the parameter @xmath162 of the external potential ( [ eq : upl ] ) only through the ratio @xmath163 .",
    "thus , for a fixed power - law dependence of the trapping potential ( @xmath164 fixed ) , an adiabatic change of @xmath162 , like for example an adiabatic expansion of the harmonic trap , does not bring us closer to the transition , since the ratio @xmath163 remains constant .",
    "a reduction of the ratio @xmath163 is instead obtained by increasing adiabatically @xmath164 , that is , changing the power - law dependence of the trapping potential ( pinkse _ et al .",

    "gross - pitaevskii theory is a natural framework for investigating interference phenomena in a quantitative way . in this theory ,",
    "the phase coherence of the condensate is assumed from the very beginning .",
    "the interference patterns can be obtained by solving numerically the gp equation ( [ eq : tdgp ] ) for two condensates .",

    "[ fig : interference ] the experimental results are plotted together with the theoretical calculations by rhrl _",
    "the good agreement between theory and experiment reveals that the concept of phase coherence , as assumed in gp theory , works very well .",
    "this was not obvious _ a priori _ , since the system is finite - sized and interacting and hence phase coherence is expected to be only approximate .",
    "another interesting manifestation of phase coherence in trapped condensates is the possible occurrence of josephson - type effects , in analogy with well known properties of josephson junctions in superconductors and superfluids .",
    "the physical idea consists of considering a double - well trap , with a barrier between the two condensates . if the chemical potential in the two traps is different , a flux of atoms is generated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : josephson ] we show a simplified scheme . if one assumes the barrier between the two wells to be high enough , then eq .

    "the overlap between the condensates occurs only in the classically forbidden region , where the wave function is small and nonlinear effects due to interactions can be ignored .",
    "thus in this region the linear combination @xmath843 is still a solution of the time dependent equation ( [ eq : tdgp ] ) .",

    "the propagation of density solitons across regions of phase discontinuity in the collision of two condensates has been also considered as an analogue of a josephson - like effect ( reinhardt and clark , 1997 ) .",

    "_ kinetics of the condensate : _ an important question , not yet fully understood , is the kinetics of the condensate nucleation .",
    "the process of condensation of a uniform ideal gas was considered by semicoz and tkachev ( 1995 ) on the basis of the boltzmann equation .",
    "they assumed that the distribution function depends only on the energy of the atoms and found that this function exhibits a divergence at zero energy after a finite time interval , corresponding to the onset of bose - einstein condensation . in previous investigations",
    "the mechanism of condensation was predicted to occur only asymptotically .",
    "the next stage of the process is the growth of the condensate .",
    "this was considered recently by gardiner _",
    "( 1997 ) and jaksch _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) on the basis of quantum kinetic master equations .",
    "the kinetics of the bose gas near critical conditions for condensation has also been studied by monte carlo simulations taking into account the bose statistics under the random phase approximation ( wu , arimondo and foot , 1997 ) . in a very recent experiment at mit ( miesner _ et al . _ , 1998 ) the formation and growth of the condensate has been investigated by means of imaging techniques .",
    "this work has shown clear evidence for a behavior known as  bosonic stimulation \" , which corresponds to an enhancement of the condensation rate induced by the condensate itself .",
    "explicitly , if @xmath7 atoms are in the condensate the condensation rate is proportional to @xmath870 .",
    "this gain mechanism is familiar in the physics of optical lasers and , in the case of trapped atoms , can lead to matter - wave amplification .",
    "another important question recently investigated experimentally is the decay of the trapped gas due to three - body recombination , yielding formation of molecules and loss of atoms from the trap ( burt _ el al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; stamper - kurn _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998a ) .",
    "the corresponding rate turns out to be different for a condensate and a thermal cloud , confirming the theoretical predictions by kagan , svitsunov and shlyapnikov ( 1985 ) .",
    "_ mixtures of condensates : _ binary mixtures of condensates can be obtained experimentally by trapping at the same time two different atomic species ( different isotopes or different alkalis ) , or two different spin states of the same atoms .",
    "the confining potential of the two condensates may be centered at the same point , or not .",
    "ground state and dynamic calculations of two interacting condensates have been carried out by ho and shenoy ( 1996b ) using the thomas - fermi approximation and by esry _",
    "( 1997 ) by solving the gp equations .",
    "similar calculations have also been done by graham and walls ( 1998 ) and by pu and bigelow ( 1998 ) .",

    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "suggestions have been made to use the same mixture of states in order to observe nonlinear josephson - type oscillations ( williams _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "_ fermions : _ the study of degenerate fermi gases in traps is expected to be an important issue of future research .",
    "trapping of fermionic species has been reported for @xmath873li ( mcalexander _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) and @xmath874k ( cataliotti _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "sympathetic cooling of fermions by bosons might yield low temperature regimes overcoming the problem of the suppression of collisional processes exhibited by polarized fermi gases at low temperature . degenerate fermi gases behave quite differently from bosonic sytems .",
    "effects of fermi statistics can be observed in the behavior of the release energy below the fermi temperature ; for an ideal gas of @xmath7 fully polarized atoms , the latter is given by @xmath875 , with the usual definition @xmath121 .",

    "can undergo a phase transition to a superfluid phase .",
    "the resulting behavior in the presence of a harmonic trap has been the object of several studies [ see , for instance , baranov _ et al . _",

    "one can obtain higher densities , useful , for example , to study three - body decay processes and more correlated configurations . on the other hand different geometrical configurations can be achieved , like for example quasi 1d structures .",
    "finally , by releasing the condition of spin polarization imposed by magnetic trapping , this new method of confinement will permit one to study in a systematic way the magnetic properties of these gases , including the spinor nature of the order parameter ( ho and shenoy , 1996a ; ho , 1998 ; ohmi and machida , 1998 ) .",
    "spin domains in condensates of sodium , made by three hyperfine states of the @xmath876 multiplet , have been recently observed by stenger _",
    "( 1998 ) , who have demostrated the anti - ferromagnetic character of the spin - dependent interaction .",
    "a further advantage of the optical traps is that they allow one to observe feshbach resonances for strong - field seeking states , as already done by inouye _",
    "( 1998 ) with sodium .",
    "feshbach resonances are strong variations of the scattering length , induced by an external field , which occur when a quasibound molecular state has nearly zero energy and couples resonantly to the free states of the colliding atoms .",
