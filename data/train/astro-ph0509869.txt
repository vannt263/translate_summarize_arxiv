    "ir4 is very bright in k@xmath46-band ( mag @xmath143 ) and appears to be of spectral type much earlier than o5 as indicated by a triangle in the cm diagram .",

    "hunter et al .",

    "considering the facts : ( a ) ir4 is coincident with the oh maser position , ( b ) it is the source of bipolar outflow , and ( c ) has large infrared excess ( j - k @xmath144 ) , it is likely that this source could be an embedded pre - main sequence object .",
    "the ionisation of gas could also be attributed to ir5 , which according to our cm diagram is of stellar type o5 .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the source s14 peaks at the position of iras source , the radio morphology in all the three gmrt bands , shows a north - south extension indicating that perhaps this is not a single compact core but rather has more than one h ii clump .",
    "this is also clearly evident from the maps of tft .",
    "kraemer et al . (",
    "2003 ) find that the iras 19111 + 1048 core consists of two compact mid infrared ( 12.5 and 20.6 @xmath1 ) components .",
    "if we consider sources only detected in the k@xmath46 band within the s14 region , we find that there are four more nir sources detected .",
    "it thus appears that the source s14 has a compact embedded cluster and is perhaps a conglomeration of h ii clumps , the brightest one at the position of s14 .    for the sources",

    "they are associated with ir6 & ir7 , respectively , which are of spectral type b7-b3 obtained from the nir cm diagram . most probably , ir6 and ir7 are reddened main sequence foreground sources based on their position in the cm diagram . for s12 also , we find that the radio and nir spectral types do not match .",
    "while the radio spectral type of the zams star is o8 , the nir counterpart is of spectral type b2 .",
    "these three cases could be spurious associations .",
    "this number of spurious associations can be compared with the estimated number of chance associations of 1.3 obtained by considering the density of nir sources ( detected in h and k@xmath46 bands ) and the search radius @xmath145 of the 19 radio sources .    from the nir cm diagram",
    ", we see that most of the zams stars within the radio nebulosity have extinction values corresponding to @xmath146 mag .",

    "lumsden & puxley , ( 1996 ) obtained @xmath148 from br-@xmath149 imaging and radio continuum observations for this source .",
    "although the radio and nir k@xmath46-band images indicate positional match for some radio and nir sources ( with consistent spectral types ) , there are a number of radio sources which do not have a nir counterpart .",
    "the radio spectral types indicate that these are bright sources which ought to have been detected in nir .",
    "their absence gives rise to two possibilities : ( 1 ) the radio sources are high density ionised clumps with no centrally exciting star or ( 2 ) the medium is clumpy with dense distributions of a@xmath150 , while the average visual extinction is lower ( a@xmath151 ) .",
    "next , we show that the first scenario of high density clumps being ionised by zams stars located away from them can be ruled out . for instance",
    ", s13 does not have a nir counterpart .",
    "an estimation of the lyman continuum photons reaching s13 from its neighbour s14 ( the brightest source in this region ; see fig 6 ) due to geometrical factors shows that , in the absence of any intervening medium , the expected luminosity is only 5% of its observed luminosity .",
    "hence , it is more likely that the second scenario is responsible for the non - detection of the nir counterparts .",
    "a high resolution mapping of molecular species probing the cold and dense gas over a large region ( @xmath152 ) around this source is required to better our understanding of the physical picture of this region .",
    "the radio morphology towards the north - east of the extended radio emission indicates steepness of the gradient of the radio emission .",
    "this could be due to the restriction of the ionised region by molecular gas , as seen in other regions like s201 ( ojha et al .",
    ", 2004a ) and ngc7538 ( ojha et al .",
    ", 2004b ) .",
    "we have also cross - correlated the msx psc sources with those from 2mass psc which lie within the radio nebulosity .",
    "there are 2 such msx psc sources , g045.1331 + 00.1436 and g045.1221 + 00.1323 ( hereafter m1 and m2 , respectively ; listed in table 9 and shown in fig 14 ) . while m1 is close to ir2 ( @xmath153 ) , m2 coincides with ir4 . from the 2mass - msx colour - colour diagram ( @xmath154 vs @xmath155 , lumsden et al .",
    "2002 ) , we find that these sources lie in the region generally covered by compact h ii regions .",

    "<S> a multiwavelength study of the star forming regions associated with iras 19111 + 1048 and iras 19110 + 1045 has been carried out . </S>",
    "<S> these have been simultaneously mapped in two far infrared bands at @xmath0 and 200 @xmath1 with @xmath2 angular resolution using the tifr 1-m balloon borne telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the radio emission from the ionised gas of these regions has been imaged at 1280 , 610 and 325 mhz using the giant metrewave radio telescope , india . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 20 compact radio sources have been detected from the high resolution radio map of iras 19111 + 1048 at 1280 mhz ( of which one is of non - thermal origin ) . </S>",
    "<S> assuming these sources to represent exciting zero age main sequence ( zams ) stars , the initial mass function [ @xmath3 is found to be quite steep , with @xmath4 for the mass range @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the near infrared ( nir ) source coincident with the iras peak is likely to be an embedded pre - main sequence star . </S>",
    "<S> an attempt has been made to identify sources responsible for ionising the gas using nir sources from 2mass . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral types of the zams stars inferred independently from the radio and nir measurements match very well for a good fraction of the radio sources having nir counterparts . for the iras 19110 + 1045 region , </S>",
    "<S> seven radio sources have been detected of which two are associated with deeply embedded 2mass objects . </S>",
    "<S> self consistent radiative transfer modelling aimed at extracting important physical and geometrical details of the two iras sources has been carried out using the above cluster of zams stars as the central exciting sources . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit models are in good agreement with the observed spectral energy distributions . </S>",
    "<S> a uniform density distribution of dust and gas is implied for both the sources . </S>",
    "<S> the extents of ionised gas , number of zams stars , presence of deeply embedded sources and lower value of @xmath6 for the cloud , support the youth of iras 19110 + 1045 vis - a - vis its neighbour , iras 19111 + 1048 , consistent with earlier studies . </S>"
