    "<S> introduction    the derivation of the elastic energy of a thin object as limit of the elastic energy of the three - dimensional body when its thickness vanishes has recently gained increasing attention in the case of prestrained bodies . </S>",
    "<S> many authors contributed to this topics , both in the case of @xmath0-d to @xmath1-d dimension reduction as in @xcite and in the case of @xmath0-d to @xmath2-d dimension reduction as in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a similar problem in the theory of nematic elastomers ) .    as a model example in the @xmath0-d to @xmath2-d case in @xcite , motivated by recent experiments in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the following model : given two strips of elastomers of the same initial width , but unequal length , one stretches the short one uniaxially to be equal in length to the longer one and then glues them together side - by - side along their length . </S>",
    "<S> in such a way a bi - strip system is formed in which the initially shorter strip is under a uniaxial prestrain . </S>",
    "<S> the bi - strip is made flat by the presence of a terminal load which is gradually released so that it starts to bend and twist out of plane . according to @xcite the system may evolve towards either a helical or a hemihelical shape , more complex structure in which helices with different chiralities seem to periodically alternate , leading to the formation of the so - called perversions .    in the paper </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have analyzed the @xmath0-d to @xmath2-d limit of the bi - strip system above via @xmath3-convergence , rigorously proving that for small prestrains the kirchoff - rod energy with intrinsic curvature is the right variational approximation of the model . among other things </S>",
    "<S> we have also proved a preliminary bifurcation result , showing the emergence of a branch of nontrivial stationary points from the straight configuration , at a critical force @xmath4 and under clamping at both ends . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , along the lines of a result by kohn and sternberg ( @xcite ) , we have proved the existence of local minimizer for the @xmath5-model arbitrarily close to the limiting ones . </S>",
    "<S> such a result however could not be applied to the branch of critical points we found , since we had no information about their stability . </S>",
    "<S> + in the present paper we fill this gap by a thorough analysis establishing that the branch of stationary points found in @xcite is locally made of exactly two _ non trivial strict local minimizers _ , close to the straight configuration , for any given value of the force _ in a left neighborhood _ of the critical force @xmath4 ( see the bifurcation diagram in fig [ fig - intro ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account our sign convention , motivated by the mechanical experiment we have in mind , this corresponds to a supercritical bifurcation diagram . as we discuss in remark [ shape ] , these local minimizers have a so - called hemihelical structure . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of such configurations is a well - known experimental fact in the mechanical literature ( see ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * introduction ) for an heuristic description of the phenomenon ) which finds now a full mathematical justification . </S>",
    "<S> we additionally prove that for those values of the forces , the local minimizers have less energy than the straight configuration , an information that can be important to study evolutionary problems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , thanks to our result in @xcite , existence of @xmath0-d nontrivial local minimizers arbitrarily close to these configurations immediately follows ( see theorem [ hemihelix ] ) . coming back to the experiment in @xcite , it is worth noticing , as we discuss in remark [ multiple ] , that our result do not cover the case of multiple perversions for which a different analysis seems to be needed ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> +    the main idea behind the proof of our main result ( theorem [ localopt ] ) is a careful combination of variational techniques with classical results about eigenvalue problems in banach spaces . in particular we show that if the second differential of the energy along a curve of stationary points is not positive definite , then a nontrivial solution to an eigenvalue problem ( see ) appears . the behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue of such a problem can be determined using a classical result by crandall and rabinowitz ( theorem [ crii ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> eventually this allows us to find a contradiction and then show that our stationary points are indeed strict local minimizers . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth pointing out that the abstract approach to bifurcation problems ( see @xcite ) is usually formulated in spaces of smooth functions in order to have high differentiability of the involved functionals , while local minimality of our configurations is meaningful in the natural energy space of sobolev functions . </S>",
    "<S> we fill this gap thanks to the regularity of the solutions of the euler - lagrange equation . </S>",
    "<S> + from a technical point of view , in order to prove these results we need to describe our energy functional in terms of cardan angles ( see section [ section 3 ] ) , while for the existence result in ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 5.6 ) we introduced a different auxiliary functional . </S>",
    "<S> this latter , however , would be not useful to perform the more detailed analysis contained in the present paper , since its differentials coincide with those of the energy only at first order , while for some auxiliary computations as those in lemma [ abc ] and for the arguments in theorem [ localopt ] we need to use differentials of the energy of higher order . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is only thanks to the use of cardan angles that already in proposition [ definebranch ] we can obtain more information than in ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 5.6 ) , namely the local behaviour of the force component of the bifurcation curve , as well as the energy inequality ( iii ) in the statement . </S>"
