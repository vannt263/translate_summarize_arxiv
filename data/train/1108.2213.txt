    "the two - channel kondo effect represents a prime example of non - fermi liquid behavior arising from a stable intermediate - coupling fixed point.@xcite theoretically , its physics is essentially understood , thanks to an exact solution by bethe ansatz.@xcite in addition , boundary conformal field theory ( cft ) has proved to be a powerful technique to study the low - energy properties of the multi - channel kondo model@xcite allowing , in particular , the calculation of exact asymptotic green s functions.@xcite cft techniques have also been used to calculate exact crossover green s functions.@xcite further , by means of abelian bosonization and subsequent re - fermionization it has been possible to map the two - channel kondo problem onto a resonant - level model which reduces to a free fermion form for a particular value of exchange anisotropy.@xcite    on the experimental side , a number of heavy - fermion materials , displaying deviations from fermi - liquid behavior , have been speculated to realize two - channel kondo physics arising from non - kramers doublet ground states of u or pr ions.@xcite however , to our knowledge , there is no unambiguous verification of these proposals .",
    "consequently , various attempts were made to realize the two - channel kondo effect in nanostructures , and indeed success was reported@xcite for a setup of a semiconductor quantum dot coupled to two reservoirs.@xcite very recently , signatures of two - channel kondo behavior of magnetic adatoms on graphene have been reported,@xcite and this motivates to discuss two - channel kondo impurities in non - metallic hosts . in particular , neutral graphene realizes a pseudogap density of states ( dos ) , @xmath5 with @xmath4 , at low energies .",
    "the single - channel pseudogap kondo problem has been studied extensively in the context of kondo impurities in unconventional superconductors .",

    "our main findings for the two - channel kondo model are :    \\(a ) the overscreened non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) phase of the metallic two - channel kondo model @xcite survives for @xmath8 , albeit with an important modification : it is no longer represented by a _ line _ of nfl fixed points ( where particle  hole ( p - h ) asymmetry is marginal ) , but instead there is only an isolated stable p - h symmetric nfl fixed point , i.e. , p - h asymmetry is irrelevant for @xmath9.@xcite furthermore , this stable nfl phase is only reached for kondo couplings larger than a critical coupling , i.e. , a boundary quantum phase transition emerges between a local - moment phase with an unscreened spin moment and the nfl phase .",

    "\\(b ) the two - channel pseudogap kondo physics for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be fully understood in the language of the two - channel anderson model , by virtue of a generalization of the approach presented in ref .  .",
    "the low - energy field theory describing the quantum phase transition between the phases with free spin and flavor moments is given by a level crossing of a spin doublet and a flavor doublet minimally coupled to conduction electrons .",
    "similar to the single - channel pseudogap kondo problem , @xmath4 is found to play the role of an upper - critical dimension , where the hybridization is marginal . for @xmath13 ,",
