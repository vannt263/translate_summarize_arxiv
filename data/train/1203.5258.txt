    "most of the stars of all masses in the galaxy form in rich clusters . despite this , the details of the clustered star formation process are still poorly understood .",
    "studies of _ low - mass protoclusters _ have started to unveil similarities and differences between isolated and clustered dense cores ( e.g.   andr et al .",
    "@xcite , foster et al .",
    "@xcite , friesen et al .",
    "globally these studies suggest that cluster environment has a relatively smaller influence on the properties of the cores ( temperature , mass , velocity dispersion , chemical abundances of early phase molecules ) than is typically assumed ( foster et al .",
    "however , the conclusions described above do not include observations of _ high - mass star forming regions_. because the phenomena associated with massive star formation have a stronger impact on the environment ( massive outflows , uv radiation , expanding  regions ) , it is plausible that these energetic phenomena have major effects on the surrounding dense material .",
    "the study of such interaction is especially important to quantify the effect of protostellar feedback on the environment and test recent models of high - mass star formation including outflows and radiation from the newly born stars ( e.g.  krumholz et al .",
    "2011 , hennebelle et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "interferometric observations of dense gas and dust tracers ( , mm continuum , ) have revealed the presence of pre - stellar core candidates surrounding ultracompact  regions ( ) and other massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) that do show evidences of such an interaction .",
    "for example , fontani et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that in the protocluster associated with iras 05345 + 3157 the kinematics of two pre - stellar core candidates is influenced by the passage of a massive outflow .",

    "@xcite , busquet et al .",
    "2010 , pillai et al .",
    "therefore , to date it is not clear if and how the presence of massive objects affects the properties and evolution of the other ( pre-)protocluster members .    the protocluster associated with  ( hereafter ) represents an excellent laboratory to study this issue .",
    "the iras source is located to the northeastern side of the cygnus ob2 association , at 1.4 kpc of distance from the sun ( sridharan et al .",
    "2002 , rygl et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and two bright nebulous stars , irs 1 ( north ) and irs 3 ( south ) , are found inside the iras error ellipse when observed at high angular resolution ( kumar et al .",
    "the bright infrared stars are embedded in a cometary - like cloud whose head , facing the cygnus ob2 association , is bright at centimeter wavelengths and whose tail , bright in the mid - infrared , is extending for about @xmath0 ( @xmath1  pc ) towards the north - east ( fig .  [ fig_largefov ] ) .",
    "this kind of clouds are also known as bright rimmed clouds .",
    "thanks to interferometric observations of  and 1.3  mm continuum , palau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) concluded that irs 1 is an intermediate - mass class i yso driving a molecular outflow in the east - west direction , while irs 3 is likely a more evolved intermediate / high - mass star .",
    "this is further confirmed through mid - infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations , from which campbell et al .",
    "( @xcite ) also estimated a bolometric luminosity of the order of 1000  for both irs 1 and irs 3 .",
    "furthermore , irs 3 is at the centre of an uc -region detected through vla centimeter continuum emission ( carral et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and of a fan - shaped emission in the 2.12  @xmath2 m rovibrational line of molecular hydrogen ( kumar et al .  @xcite ) . east and west of this fan - shaped feature , palau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) detected molecular gas and dust resolved into several millimeter continuum compact sources .",
    "palau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) interpreted these starless condensations as being accumulated on the walls of the expanding shock front , but could not derive firm conclusions on their origin and nature .",
    "this work aims at better understading the nature of the dense cores in , and its relation with the neighbouring more evolved objects . to achieve the goal we performed observations of molecular species obtained at high angular resolution with the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy ( carma ) at 3  mm and the very large array ( vla ) at 1.3  cm .",
    "all selected molecular transitions are commonly used to characterise dense gas : ( i )  and  are excellent tracers of dense and cold cores because either species do not suffer from depletion up to @xmath3 , and  is extensively used as thermometer in both low- and high - mass star forming regions ; ( ii )  provides an estimate of the degree of deuteration ( with ) .",

    "3  mm carma observations of  were obtained on 29 mar 2010 in c- and 01 may 2010 in d - configuration under good weather conditions for observations at 3 mm , characterized by about 5 mm of precipitable water and atmospheric noise rms of about 300 @xmath2 m as measured on a baseline of 100 m at the frequency of 225 ghz .",

    "2002 ) . the primary beam of the 10  m and 6  m dishes at about 85  ghz is @xmath8  and 121 , respectively .",
    "the single - side - band system temperature during the observations was below 150 k. during c - configuration observations , the correlator provided 4 bands which were configured to observe the continuum , the , the  and the  lines simultaneously .",
    "d - array observations were obtained with the new carma correlator , which provides more bands .",
    "two 500 mhz bands were used to observe the continuum and 5 bands set up to observe the , , , ccs and  line emission .",
    "the pass - band was calibrated by observing 1733 - 130 ; flux calibration was set by observing mwc349 .",
    "the estimated uncertainty of the absolute flux calibration is 10% , and it is determined from periodic observations of mwc349 .",
    "atmospheric and instrumental effects were corrected by observing the nearby quasar 2007 + 404 every 15 minutes .",
    "the tracers observed and the main observational parameters ( frequency , synthesised beam , linear resolution , spectral resolution , 1@xmath9 rms channel noise , largest detectable angular scale ) are reported in table  [ obs_par ] .",
    "the ccs line is the only undetected transition and will be not discussed in the following .",
    "the continuum was derived by averaging the 500 mhz bands .",
    "visibility data were edited and calibrated with the miriad package .",
    "a minor flagging of the data was performed using the uvflag task , mainly to remove the intervals characterized by the bad atmospheric phase coherence .",
    "the channel spacing and the corresponding 1 @xmath9 rms noise are shown in table  [ obs_par ] .",
    "merging the visibilities obtained in c and d configuration , imaging , deconvolution , and analysis of channel maps and continuum were performed using the standard tasks of the gildas package ( e.g. uvmerge , uvmap , clean ) .",
    "images were created applying natural weighting to the visibilites .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ tab_coldensratio ] we report the column densities of ,  and , and the column density ratios -to-  and -to- .",
    "the -to-  ratio is of order 0.1 ( from @xmath10 to 0.15 ) , and does not change greatly from core to core .",
    "such values are much larger than the cosmic d / h ratio , estimated to be @xmath11 ( linsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and comparable to those measured towards low - mass pre  stellar cores ( roueff et al .",
    "@xcite ) and infrared dark clouds ( pillai et al .",
    "this implies that the deuteration in the cores of  is as high as in colder and more quiescent environments , despite the relatively higher gas temperature and turbulence , and confirms previous findings in other dense cores associated with intermediate- to high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g.  busquet et al .",
    "@xcite , pillai et al .",
    "interestingly , relatively high values are found also close to the uc  region associated with irs  3 , in mmb and irs3-sw . because  is efficiently formed on dust grains ,",
    "a strong uv radiation can heat the dust and cause  evaporation thus increasing its abundance .",
    "on the other hand , a strong uv radiation could ( at least partly ) decrease the abundance of , due to its interaction with h@xmath12 to form nh@xmath13 ( e.g. fuente et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "concerning the -to-  ratio , we find the largest value in mme ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the enhancement of the -to-  ratio can be understood when freeze - out of species heavier than he becomes important ( see e.g.  flower et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so that it is expected to increase when the starless core gets closer to the onset of star formation .",
    "in this scenario , the fact that mme has the largest -to-  ratio suggests that this core could be close to the onset of gravitational collapse , i.e. mme could be a candidate massive pre  stellar core .",
    "however , palau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) measured with the sma a mass of only 0.7  from the 1.3  mm continuum , while we find 23 .",
    "this discrepancy likely comes from extended flux filtered out by the sma , which means that the core is quite flat and not centrally - peaked as expected for a pre  stellar core .",
    "based on the results of this work , we propose our final interpretation for the nature of each one of the 3  mm condensations :    * mma is probably a protostar candidate .",
    "although it does not show any embedded infrared source , its relatively high , large line broadening , and -to-  lower than in other cores suggest that this condensation is evolved .",
    "* mme is likely a pre  stellar core , because it shows high -to-  and -to-  ratios , is more quiescent than mma and it does not appear fragmented into smaller condensations when observed at higher angular resolution ( palau et al .",
    "@xcite ) . assuming a typical star formation efficiency of @xmath15% , the core ,",
    "the mass of which is 23 , has the potential to form an intermediate- to high - mass object . *",
    "the nature of mmb , mmc and mmd is less clear . due to the low -to-  and -to-  ratios",
    ", mmd could be a protostellar object , consistent with clear hints of contraction motions seen in the   ( 1,1 ) spectrum , while for mmb we found hints of expansion due to asymmetric emission in the two inner satellites ( see sect .",
    "[ res_linesvla ] ) .",
    "certainly , all condensations are perturbed ( mmb by the ionisation front from irs  3 , mmc by irs  1 and the outflow associated with it , mmd perhaps by a combination of both ) . only higher sensitivity and angular resolution observations will allow to better understand the nature of these cores .",
    "the most striking result of this work is the clear confirmation of a cavity opened by irs 3 in the molecular surrounding gas , and a tight interaction between this cavity and the surrounding dense gas .",
    "we have found several evidences of this : ( i ) the morphology of all the molecular tracers , especially in  and , delineates a cavity around irs  3 and the 1.3  cm continuum map resolving the ionised gas perfectly matches the profile of the cavity ; ( ii ) the  integrated intensity ( 2,2)/(1,1 ) ratios are large near irs  3 ; ( iii ) the line widths are also large near irs  3 , specially in  and ; ( iv ) the position - velocity plot of  shows a u - structure typical of an expanding shell ; ( v ) in the mmb core we found hints of expansion in the  ( 1,1 ) spectrum due to different intensity of the two inner satellites .",
    "these evidences of such an interaction are shown for the first time in this work .",
    "if we put together all the results obtained , we speculate about a possible scenario that describes the star formation history in : irs  1 and irs  3 , both having bolometric luminosities of about 1000  , seem to come from the same natal cloud while being clearly in different evolutionary stages , which points towards different generations of ( intermediate- to high - mass ) star formation in . in this context ,",
    "irs  3 could have induced the formation of irs  1 , as could be inducing star formation on the west ( in mma ) . on the other hand , in this bright - rimmed cloud",
    "the star formation probably has not been triggered by the uv radiation from the cygnus ob2 association stars , because irs  3 , the massive star that formed first , is relatively distant from the bright rim , and the dense gas where we find the bulk of the current star formation activity is around irs  3 and away from the bright rim .",
    "therefore , the star formation seems to be dominated by irs  3 , which has been caught in the act of pushing away and disrupting its natal cloud .",
    "the protocluster associated with the centre of  is an excellent location where the interaction between evolved intermediate- and high - mass protostellar objects and dense ( starless ) cores can be studied .",
    "we have derived the physical and chemical properties of the dense gas by means of carma and vla observations of the millimeter and centimeter continuum , and of several molecular tracers ( , , , , ) .",
    "below , we summarise the main results .",
    "* morphologically , the dense gas is distributed in a filament oriented east - west that passes in between irs  1 and irs  3 , the two most massive and evolved objects .",
    "we resolve the dense gas into five millimeter continuum condensations .",
    "all of them show column densities consistent with potentially being the birthplace of intermediate- to high - mass objects , although the masses derived from continuum suggest that they can form intermediate - mass objects more likely .",
    "* we confirm the presence of an expanding cavity driven by irs  3 demonstrated mainly by the shape of the emission in the two pdr tracers  and , as well as by hints of expanding motions from both the position - velocity diagrams and the asymmetric intensity of the two inner satellites of the  ( 1,1 ) line of the millimetre core closest to irs  3 ( mmb ) . *",
    "the non - thermal line widths across the filament indicate that the gas kinematics is dominated by turbulence , similarly to other intermediate- and high - mass star - forming regions and different from low - mass dense starless cores .",
    "* the rotation and kinetic temperatures derived from ammonia are on average larger than those typically found in cores associated with low - mass star - forming regions , especially around the cavity walls .",
    "the most massive and extended millimeter core , mme , shows physical and chemical signatures of an intermediate- to high - mass pre  stellar core candidate .",
    "* we have better constrained the spectral index of the radio - continuum emission associated with irs  3 , which turns out to be flat , and thus the ionised gas comes from a region photoionised by the b2 zams star at the centre of irs  3 .",
    "* the column density ratio /  is of the order of  200 - 400 across the source and is higher where the dense gas is getting disrupted . *",
    "the deuterated fraction -to-  is of the order of 0.1 in all cores , as large as in low - mass pre ",
    "stellar cores and infrared dark clouds .",
    "we find high levels of deuteration also close to the cavity driven by irs  3 .",
    "we speculate that evaporation of  and  destruction caused by the uv radiation field can influence this high deuteration .",
    "these findings undoubtedly confirm a tight interaction in  between the most massive and evolved objects and the dense surrounding starless cores in several respects ( kinematics , temperature , chemical gradients ) , and suggest that irs  3 could have induced the formation of irs  1 and of the other gaseous condensations accumulated on the cavity walls .",
    "however , the large - scale morphology of the molecular tracers suggests that we are likely seeing only a limited portion of a very extended gaseous filament .",
    "only a large pc - scale mosaic will allow us to fully trace the distribution of the dense gas in the region and delineate a complete view of the core population .",

    "assuming that the excitation temperature is @xmath19 , the ratio of intensities of the main line to the inner satellite line is @xmath20 the usual assumption is that we are observing a homogeneous isothermal region , so that both excitation temperatures , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are equal , and that @xmath23 . in this case , @xmath24 the lower limit corresponds to the optically thin case , while the upper limit is the optically thick case .    in sect .",
    "3.2.2 we have shown nh@xmath17 @xmath18 spectra for each of the 3 mm continuum clumps .",
    "for the case of mma , the intensity ratio of the inner satellites and the main line is @xmath25 , lower than the optically thin limit , @xmath26 .",
    "the assumption that the observed ratio is close to 0.28 , and that the emission in mma is optically thin , leads to inconsistent results . for an optical depth of the main line of @xmath27",
    ", we obtain that @xmath28 k , which is much higher than the kinetic temperature estimated from the intensities ratio @xmath29 ( see text ) , @xmath30 k. this result is improbable , since we expect the excitation temperature to be , in general , lower than the kinetic temperature .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath31 is close to the kinetic temperature , indicating that the optical depth of the main line is probably @xmath32 .",
    "the optical depth of the satellite , however , can be lower , so that both lines are tracing the emission of different layers of the region observed : the main line , the outer layer facing the observer ; and the satellite line , a deeper layer of material ( see fig .  [ figappendix ] ) .",
    "the easiest explanation of the anomalous ratio @xmath33 is to assume that the region is not isothermal , and that the two layers at different physical depths , have different temperatures .",
    "so , the two excitation temperatures , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are not equal .",
    "thus , @xmath34    assuming that @xmath22 is lower than @xmath35 , @xmath36 giving that the optical depth of the main line must be @xmath37 .",
    "thus , taking into account that @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath38 resulting in @xmath39 the result is that the deeper layer traced by the satellite line is colder than the outer layer traced by the main line .",
    "if we assume that the kinetic temperature of mma , obtained from the ratio @xmath29 , is tracing the outer layer , the outer layer temperature is 22 k , while the inner layer temperature is between 5 k and 8 k. the higher temperature of the outer layer is indicative of external heating , as discussed in the text ."
