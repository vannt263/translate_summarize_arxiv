    "although doping suppresses both the fe magnetic order and lattice distortion in the parent compounds , magnetism is believed to play a major role in the superconducting pairing mechanism as demonstrated , e.g. , by the appearance of a magnetic resonance in the superconducting state.@xcite therefore , understanding the magnetism in the iron - based parent compounds can lead to insight about the mechanism that induces superconductivity by doping or pressure.@xcite    cefeaso is a typical example of rare - earth - containing @xmath5feaso , with a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural transition upon cooling at @xmath6 k that is followed by the onset of stripe - like fe afm order below @xmath7 k.@xcite long - range afm ordering of ce below @xmath1 4 k was first reported in powder neutron diffraction studies proposing a ce magnetic structure that required further confirmation.@xcite this study also suggested that ce - fe coupling is relatively strong as it influences the magnetic fe peaks above @xmath2 up to @xmath8 20 k. furthermore , in support of strong fe - ce coupling , @xmath9sr measurements @xcite on polycrystalline cefeaso show a considerable 3@xmath10 - 4@xmath11 hybridization that leads to a considerable staggered ce magnetization up to almost 120 k , far above @xmath2 .",

    "have argued that strong hybridization of fe - as orbitals can modify the form factor in an irregular form for different reflections.@xcite 2 ) the ce magnetic short range ordering due to induced ce spins by the fe sublattice may add anomalous contribution to specific peak intensities that can affect the calculation of the average fe magnetic moments .",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath9sr ) measurements show the magnetic contribution from ce moments is finite ( @xmath58 0.075 @xmath59 at 40 k ) and may induce such changes to the intensities of some bragg reflections.@xcite this scenario is probably not valid here since all line widths of magnetic reflections , including the ( 101 ) and ( 301 ) , and the weak ( 100 ) are resolution limited as all other magnetic reflections , such as ( 102 ) ( see fig .

    "we also note that the resonance energy is shifted by approximately 1 ev above the ce @xmath0 absorption edge , as determined from the inflection point of the charge ( 004 ) signal .",

    "the gradual increase in the integrated intensity and the absence of the thermal hysteresis upon both warming and cooling processes indicate the second - order nature of the transition .",
    "all these results confirm the formation of ce afm long - range ordering _ via _ ce - ce exchange interaction below @xmath1 4 k. note that this is consistent with magnetic susceptibility measurements , which show an effective moment of 2.25 @xmath59 per ce@xmath76 ion , close to the free - ion value of 2.54 @xmath59 and a negative weiss temperature of @xmath8 -17 k indicative of a dominant afm ce - ce coupling.@xcite the measured transition temperature by rxms , @xmath77 k , is in good agreement with the anomaly observed in our heat capacity , resistivity measurements and also the low temperature anomaly observed in the ( 100 ) , ( 101 ) , ( 120 ) and ( 102 ) neutron diffraction studies .",

    "this short - range ce ordering is most probably due to the polarized ce moments by fe - ce coupling as observed by @xmath9sr measurements on polycrystalline cefeaso sample@xcite .",
    "whereas the rxms shows a single transition associated with the ce ordering at @xmath2 @xmath80 k , the neutrons show abrupt increase in the intensity of the magnetic reflections , such as ( 100 ) , ( 101 ) , ( 102 ) and ( 120 ) at @xmath81 k , and only a subtle anomaly at @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that the neutron and rxms were conducted on the same crystal .",
    "moreover , we also performed rxms measurements on the third piece of crystal from a different batch and obtained reproducible results .",
    "since either fe spin reorientation , short range ordering development of ce , or both may be responsible for the anomaly at @xmath79 , we further examine the nature of this anomaly .",
    "below we argue that the anomaly is mainly due to fe spin reorientation , with a probable minor contribution from ce short - range ordering .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimentaldata](a ) , the ( 100 ) integrated intensity , not allowed by the fe sdw magnetic structure with the moment along _",
    "a_-axis , is negligible compared to other magnetic reflections such as ( 101 ) , ( 102 ) , ( 120 ) above @xmath79 , but the ( 100 ) integrated intensity increases significantly and becomes the strongest peak below @xmath8 @xmath79 .",
    "this special phenonmenon thereby leads to two distinct features below / above @xmath79 in the _ q _ dependence of the integrated intensity of the different magnetic reflections in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimentaldata ] ( b ) .",
    "another important observation in our experiment is that the temperature dependence of the intensity ratio of ( 102)/(120 ) exhibits an increase below @xmath79 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : experimentaldata](a ) .",
    "if there is no fe spin reorientation , the short - range ce ordering by itself would have yielded a constant in the temperature depedence of this ratio .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , we notice that the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) in the rocking curve of the new emerged ( 100 ) magnetic peak at 10 k is very similar to the almost temperature - independent fwhm values of long - range ( 101 ) and ( 102 ) magnetic bragg reflections and also nuclear bragg reflections below @xmath82 .",
    "this is evidence that ( 100 ) peak is due to long - range ordering and therefore is not induced by the short - range ce ordering .",
    "the appearance and a significant increase in intensity of the long - ranged ( 100 ) magnetic bragg peak and the anomalous intensity ratio of the ( 102)/(120 ) can be explained by a uniform rotation of the fe moment in the @xmath83-plane away from the @xmath57-axis as expressed by the @xmath84 term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) where @xmath85 is the angle between a scattering vector and the spin direction .",
    "the angular dependence of the magnetic structure factors ( @xmath86f@xmath35(hkl)@xmath86)@xmath87sin@xmath88 in the _ ab_-plane due to this term is shown in fig.9(a ) .",
    "it can be seen that with the increase of angle @xmath53 between fe moment and _ a_-axis in the _ ab _ plane , the magnetic structure factor of ( 100 ) peak increases much faster than ( 101 ) and ( 102 ) peaks , which has a tendency to result in the highest integrated intensity .",

    "9(b ) , the fe spin reorientation with absolute value of @xmath53 of @xmath8 45@xmath91 , together with the increase of magnetic moment to be @xmath8 0.98 @xmath59 is consistent with the experimental result at 10 k. the simulated intensity ratio of i@xmath35(102)/i@xmath35(120 ) is also consistent with the experimental result , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    ". alternatively , calculation of g__sf__@xmath35(@xmath36 ) according to eq .",
    "1 using the experimental data at 10 k , shows an irregular and unphysical form factor if there is no fe spin reorientation .",

    "it is interesting to point out that with the increase of the absolute values of @xmath53 , there is a crossover between two distinct features in the _ q _ dependence of simulated @xmath92 , showing similar behavior to the experimental @xmath92 with decreasing the temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : experimentaldata ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that at @xmath79 significant uniform fe spin reorientation away from _ a _ axis in the _ ab _ plane takes place .",
    "this is further confirmed by our simulation at 6 k that shows a fe spin reorientation angle of @xmath8 60 degree with an average magnetic moment of 1.1 @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , the simulated intensity ratio of i@xmath35(102)/i@xmath35(120 ) is also within the error bar of the experimental intensity ratio at 6 k ( see fig . 8 ( a ) ) .",
    "we also conducted similar simulations assuming fe spin reorientation in the _ ac _ plane , and found it is inconsistent with the experimental data at 10 k and 6 k. therefore , the anomaly at @xmath79 in cefeaso is mainly ascribed to the fe spin reorientation away from a - axis in the _ ab _ plane while preserving the underlying sdw magnetic structure .",
    "the overlap of ce magnetic bragg peaks with those of reoriented fe spins makes it impossible to state whether fe spins continue to reorient below @xmath2 .",

    "our rxms results indicate gradual but less prominent ce polarization up to at least 7.4 k as is expected from the mutual effect of the ce - fe coupling on both sites .",
    "since the anomaly at @xmath79 is mainly ascribed to the fe spin reorientation , we hypothesize that the induced finite ce moments extends even to a higher temperature @xmath8 120 k , as observed in @xmath9sr studies @xcite .",
    "the mutual influence between fe and ce sublattice above @xmath2 indicates that the ce - fe coupling due to non - heisenberg anisotropic exchange as previously suggested@xcite , is strong in cefeaso .",
