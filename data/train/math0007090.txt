    "the past twenty years have seen a number of fruitful exchanges of ideas between pure mathematics and theoretical physics . on the one hand , deep results in mathematics arising out of studies in geometry and topology have had unexpected and powerful applications to theoretical physics . on the other hand ,",
    "insights gleaned from physical models have led to a number of conceptual revolutions in mathematics , particularly in geometry and topology .",
    "one of the most exciting of these conceptual revolutions , one which is still in the process of unfolding , goes by the name `` mirror symmetry . ''",
    "mirror symmetry predicts a completely unexpected relationship between certain pairs of calabi  yau manifolds . from a mathematical point of view , the connections between the two `` mirror '' manifolds are extremely indirect , and the effort to explain them has led to a number of mathematical extensions of the original mirror phenomenon . some of these extensions have proven useful in physics as well , and physicists have also found more general contexts in which mirror symmetry can be observed .",
    "mirror symmetry has become a large field , and there have been a number of expository surveys of portions of the theory , and at least two books devoted to the subject @xcite . in this paper , we will focus on the geometric connections between mirror pairs , using the example of the quintic threefold and its mirror as a guide .",
    "we have not attempted to be complete , but have instead concentrated on a few selected developments which are not covered in other recent surveys , and which hold much promise for future interesting work .    in the first part of the paper , we review in some detail the known geometric connections ( in the context of toric geometry ) . in the second part of the paper , we outline some new directions in which the geometric understanding of mirror symmetry has been moving recently , and indicate some of the important problems remaining to be solved .",
    "although the issues discussed in this paper are mathematical in nature , the reader may wish to acquire some knowledge of physics in order to fully appreciate their context . a good place to start",
    "is deligne et al .",
    "@xcite ( although this assumes some knowledge of quantum mechanics , which can be obtained , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "a general introduction to string theory can be found in the icm address of witten @xcite , and the standard physics textbooks on string theory by green , schwarz , and witten @xcite and by polchinski @xcite can be profitably studied .",
    "the more modern aspects of string theory are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the origins of mirror symmetry in physics are easy to explain in broad outline .",
    "each of the five known superstring theories is naturally formulated in ten spacetime dimensions , and their close cousin `` m - theory '' is naturally formulated as an eleven - dimensional theory .",
    "when the ten or eleven dimensions of the theory take the form of the product of a ( small ) compact riemannian manifold @xmath1 with a non - compact four - manifold , the geometry of the compact manifold determines  to first approximation  the physics in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "( this is referred to as `` compactifying the theory '' on @xmath1 . )",
    "the mapping from geometry to physics need not be one - to - one , however , and this is where the phenomena of mirror symmetry and other related dualities arise .",
    "( see for example @xcite . )",
    "some dualities of this sort involve only a single type of superstring theory , and are simply statements that the mapping from the geometric parameter space to the physical parameter space is many - to - one .",
    "for example , the compactification of the type iia string theory on a @xmath3-torus @xmath1 has as its natural geometric parameters ( in the ns - ns sector ) a flat metric on @xmath1 and a harmonic element of @xmath4 known as the `` @xmath5-field . ''",
    "taking into account the action of @xmath6 , the geometric parameter space can be described in the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( this must be modified if @xmath10 . )",
    "however , so - called _ t - dualities _ lead to additional identifications among points in this space , and the physical ns - ns parameter space turns out to be @xmath11 instead of @xmath7 , where @xmath12 is the integral orthogonal group of an even unimodular lattice of signature @xmath13 .",
    "( intrinsically , @xmath14 . )",
    "other dualities involve two types of superstring theories .",
    "in fact , another version of t - duality is also of this sort : in its most primitive form , t - duality gives an identification between the type iia string theory compactified on a @xmath3-torus and the type iib string theory compactified on a ( geometrically different ) @xmath3-torus , when @xmath15 . in the case of a rectangular metric on the torus ( and a @xmath5-field value of zero ) , the statement is that a rectangular torus with radii @xmath16 is dual to one with radii @xmath17 , where the duality interchanges iia and iib if @xmath18 is odd , and preserves both iia and iib theories if @xmath18 is even .",
    "the geometric spaces which appear in the duality known as mirror symmetry are riemannian manifolds of dimension @xmath19 with holonomy contained in @xmath20 , often called _ calabi ",
    "yau manifolds_. ( the theorems of calabi @xcite and yau @xcite lead to an alternate characterization of these as khler manifolds with a nowhere vanishing holomorphic @xmath21-form . ) when @xmath21 is odd , mirror symmetry relates the type iia string theory compactified on one calabi ",
    "yau manifold @xmath1 to the type iib string theory compactified on another calabi  yau manifold @xmath2 , and vice versa .",
    "when @xmath21 is even , the iia theories on @xmath1 and on @xmath2 are related , as are the iib theories on @xmath1 and on @xmath2 .",
    "note that the `` other '' manifold @xmath2 will in some cases be topologically the same as @xmath1 , but typically the geometric parameters ( a metric and some harmonic @xmath22-forms ) will be different .    in the case of k3 surfaces , mirror symmetry becomes an assertion that the physical parameter space is obtained from the geometric one by additional identifications @xcite .",
    "for the type iia theory , the geometric parameter space is again described in terms of a metric on the k3 surface @xmath1 and a @xmath5-field .",
    "each metric is characterized by the corresponding @xmath23-dimensional plane of self - dual harmonic @xmath24-forms inside the @xmath25-dimensional space @xmath26 . including the limiting `` orbifold metrics , '' the geometric parameter space",
    "is then described as @xmath7 , where this time @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( here @xmath29 is an index @xmath24 subgroup of @xmath30 , isomorphic to @xmath31 @xcite . ) the total cohomology @xmath32 has the structure of an even unimodular lattice of signature @xmath33 @xcite , and the physical parameter space becomes @xmath11 , with @xmath34 . this physical mirror symmetry for k3 surfaces",
    "has many beautiful mathematical consquences , including assertions that families of algebraic k3 surfaces defined by conditions on the picard group have `` mirror dual families '' , and a connection to arnold s `` strange duality '' @xcite .",
    "in general , the assertion that two calabi  yau manifolds @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( with their geometric parameters appropriately specified ) form a `` mirror pair '' is really a statement about physics rather than about mathematics .",
    "the geometric data we have used above is a first approximation to the true physical parameters , and at present it is not known how to completely specify the physical parameter space , or even to fully test a proposed equivalence between two physical theories .    however , there are a number of purely mathematical statements which can be extracted from what we know of the physics of a mirror pair , and these statements can be tested in examples , and studied in their own right .",
    "several such mathematical spinoffs of mirror symmetry have been the subject of intense research during the past decade .",
    "the reason mirror symmetry has attracted so much attention from mathematicians is its truly surprising nature .",
    "prior to the discovery of this phenomenon by physicists @xcite , it was not even suspected that most calabi ",
    "yau manifolds would come in closely - related pairs .",
    "moreover , some of the consquences of the physical mirror equivalence were shocking : a generating function for the number of holomorphic curves of various fixed degrees on one of the calabi ",
    "yau manifolds could be computed using the integrals of a top - degree holomorphic form on the mirror partner  a totally unexpected result .",
    "among the simplest known examples of calabi  yau threefolds are the _ quintic threefolds _ : hypersurfaces of degree @xmath35 in complex projective space @xmath36 .",
    "the complex projective space , including a choice of khler metric on it , can be described by means of _ symplectic reduction _ : begin with the effective group action of @xmath37 on @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 which admits a moment map @xmath40 given by @xmath41 then @xmath42 with khler form induced by the canonical khler form @xmath43 on @xmath38 .",
    "the image of the moment map contains all positive values of @xmath44 , and all khler classes on @xmath36 are produced in this way .",
    "the quotient space is a _",
    "toric variety _",
    ": it admits an action of a complex torus @xmath45 , the complexification of @xmath46 , with an open dense orbit .",
    "the group action which was used to make this construction can be specified by means of an injective homomorphism @xmath47 ( which is instrinsically described as @xmath48 ) , or equivalently , by the cokernel @xmath49 of @xmath50 , together with the images in @xmath51 of the standard basis vectors of @xmath52 .",
    "concretely , @xmath53 , and we may choose a basis of @xmath51 so that the image vectors are given by @xmath54 in fact ( as we shall see in section [ sec : next ] ) , in toric geometry it is the convex polytope spanned by those image vectors which plays a crucial rle .",
    "the calabi ",
    "yau hypersurface is specified by a homogeneous polynomial @xmath55 of degree @xmath35 .",
    "the possible monomials in that polynomial form another convex polytope , the _ newton polytope _ of the hypersurface , whose vertices correspond to the monomials @xmath56 ,  , @xmath57 .",
    "it is convenient to select one monomial such as @xmath58 and study the quotient @xmath59 since this quotient is invarient under @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , each laurent monomial occurring in is a character of @xmath60 and can be labelled by the corresponding element of @xmath61 . in the basis",
    "dual to the basis of @xmath51 used in , the newton polytope is spanned by @xmath62 but of course also contains many other lattice points corresponding to other monomials .    to form the mirror partner @xcite",
    ", we reverse the rles of the polytopes spanned by and .",
    "that is , we use the data in to specify the symplectic reduction , and we use the data in to determine a hypersurface .",
    "there are some subtleties associated with selecting @xmath44 , the point in the image of the moment map , to which we return in section [ sec : next ] . in brief",
    ", this toric variety turns out to be a resolution of singularities of @xmath63 , and the mirror hypersurface is the image of a hypersurface with equation @xmath64 ( we will explain how this is derived in section  [ sec : explain ] below . )",
    "if we let @xmath65 act on @xmath66 , the set of hypersurfaces of the form is permuted .",
    "so we can regard @xmath65 as acting on the set of coefficients @xmath67 ; the quotient by this action is the moduli space of complex structures .    in our example",
    ", the compactified moduli space is isomorphic to @xmath68 , and a coordinate on it is provided by @xmath69 which generates the @xmath65-invariant functions on @xmath67 .",
    "the mirror hypersurface acquires additional singularities at @xmath70 and at @xmath71 ; moreover , the @xmath72 limit coincides with the fermat hypersurface .",
    "the moduli space is illustrated in figure  [ fig : moduli ] .",
    "now that we have described a mirror pair of calabi  yau manifolds , we can ask : what kind of properties are they supposed to share ( according to predictions from physics ) , and which ones can we verify ?    the first properties have to do with the hodge numbers of the calabi  yau threefolds . if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are mirror partners , then we expect that @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this property holds for our example mirror pair .",
    "in fact , @xmath75 is the dimension of the khler moduli space of @xmath1 , while @xmath76 is the dimension of its complex structure moduli space .",
    "the equality of hodge numbers is just one part of a stronger property , which asserts that these moduli spaces for @xmath1 and for @xmath2 should coincide in some appropriate sense , with the rles of khler and complex structure moduli reversed .",
    "thanks to the expectation in physics that the geometric version of the ( complexified ) khler moduli space requires so - called quantum corrections which may affect its structure , the best prediction which can be made is that the moduli spaces should agree locally in the neighborhood of some boundary point .",
    "that is , for an appropriate compactification of the moduli space of complex strutures of @xmath2 , there should be a boundary point with a neighborhood which coincides with a neighborhood in the complexified khler moduli space of @xmath1 . in the case of the mirror quintic ,",
    "this `` large complex structure limit point '' is at @xmath70 .",
    "( the singularity at @xmath71 is of a different nature . )",
    "one of the key features of the complex structure moduli space is the behavior of the period integrals on the calabi ",
    "yau manifold as a function of parameters .",
    "these period integrals always satisfy an algebraic differential equation , and in the case of toric complete intersections , these algebraic differential equations turn out to be hypergeometric systems @xcite , in fact , the generalized hypergeometric systems which have been studied in detail by gelfand , zelevinski , and kapranov @xcite .    for example ,",
    "in the case of the mirror quintic , the differential equation satisfied by the periods @xmath77 can be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79    it is easy to find a single power series solution near @xmath70 @xcite : @xmath80 but the other three solutions are elusive .",
    "the recursion relations implied by the equation lead one to a formal power series of the form @xmath81 ^ 5 } \\,z^{\\alpha +",
    "n } \\thinspace ; \\ ] ] one finds that @xmath82 and",
    "so we must have @xmath83 in order to obtain a solution .",
    "in fact @xcite , the formal solution can be interpreted with @xmath84 taken from the ring @xmath85/(\\alpha ^4)$ ] as follows : each coefficient @xmath86 ^ 5}\\ ] ] can be evaluated in that ring , and written as a polynomial in @xmath84 of degree @xmath23 .",
    "this gives a four - dimensional space of multi - valued solutions .",
    "the multi - valuedness arises due to the interpretation of @xmath87 as @xmath88 .    in other words ,",
    "if we replace @xmath89 by @xmath90 , then the solution @xmath91 is multiplied by @xmath92 .",
    "that is , the monodromy on the set of solutions near @xmath70 is represented by the action ( by multiplication ) of @xmath92 on the ring @xmath93/(\\alpha^4)$ ] .",
    "mirror symmetry proposes an identification between the cohomology ring of one calabi ",
    "yau manifold ( in our example , the quintic ) , and the ring structure on the period integrals of the other .",
    "there are factors of @xmath94 which must be introduced when comparing these rings : the generators @xmath95 which lead to monodromy transformations of the form @xmath96 must be mapped to @xmath97 , where the @xmath98 are generators of the integral cohomology of the other manifold . since the cohomology ring of the quintic takes the form @xmath99/(\\lambda^4)$ ] ,",
    "the proposed identification is verified in our example , with @xmath100 .",
    "it is known to hold for a broad class of calabi  yau complete intersections @xcite .",
    "there is no nice form for a power series solution near @xmath71 .",
    "however , we _ can _ find explict power series solutions to @xmath78 near @xmath72 .",
    "begin with a power series of the form @xmath101",

    "these are again multi - valued , since a fifth root of @xmath104 must be extracted to define the solution .",
    "the monodromy this time is given by the action of @xmath92 on the ring @xmath105/(5\\alpha -1)(5\\alpha -2)(5\\alpha -3)(5\\alpha -4 ) \\thinspace ; \\ ] ] this gives a monodromy transformation of order @xmath35 .    at all other points in the moduli space",
    "there are four independent solutions to @xmath78 .",
    "thus , it is only at the three points marked in figure  [ fig : moduli ] that there is a monodromy transformation associated to a loop around the point .    among the quantities of importance in physics",
    "are the so - called topological correlation functions , which can be calculated from the periods near @xmath70 .",
    "a close study of these functions led to the striking predictions about enumerative geometry which first awakened the interest of many mathematicians in this field .",
    "( see @xcite for the original calculation , and @xcite for accounts of these predictions intended for mathematicians . )",
    "these predictions were subsequently verified in the celebrated mirror theorem of givental @xcite and lian  liu ",
    "yau @xcite .",
    "the proofs are actually logically independent of mirror symmetry  they consist in showing that the enumerative geometry of rational curves on the quintic ( or on other calabi  yau manifolds ) has a rich structure which reproduces the predictions made by mirror symmetry . in this way ,",
    "one verifies that there are 2875 lines on the general quintic threefold , 609250 conics , 317206375 twisted cubics , and so on .",
    "for the mirror partner , the enumerative geometry ( or the topological correlation functions ) can be encoded in a structure known as the _ quantum cohomology ring _ of the calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "( in fact , the quantum cohomology is not only a ring , but also a graded frobenius algebra . )",
    "the quantum cohomology is a deformation of the usual cohomology ring , with the parameter space being a ( formal ) neighborhood of the large complex structure limit point in the moduli space .",
    "the counts of numbers of rational curves govern the coefficients in the deformation , as well as the `` trace '' in the frobenius algebra structure .",
    "mirror symmetry is expected to be a two - way street , so we should be able to reverse the rles of the quintic hypersurface and its mirror partner .",
    "however , things immediately become much more complicated .    as mentioned in section [ sec : quintic ] , the mirror partner is a resolution of singularities of a hypersurface in @xmath63 .",
    "there are many many possible choices of resolution , corresponding ( according to toric geometry ) to the possible triangulations of the polytope spanned by .",
    "one possible choice , described explicitly in @xcite , is depicted on the left side of figure  [ fig1 ] ; another , perhaps more symmetric choice , is depicted on the right side .",

    "we thus get a vast number of possible calabi  yau manifolds and associated khler moduli spaces , each of them a mirror of the original quintic threefold . however , all of these calabi ",

    "is associated a possible birational model of the mirror .",
    "the enumerative geometry implications of mirror symmetry could be calculated for each of these mirrors  each would involve a calculation which involves only a small neighborhood of the corresponding large complex structure limit point .",
    "fascinating though such computations , are , our focus here will be on ways to relate the _ entire _ moduli spaces .",
    "some preliminary hints that the entire moduli spaces are related to each other can be found by studying the combinatorics of the moduli space . in the case of the quintic , or more generally for complete intersection in toric varieites , the moduli space is itself a toric variety , associated to a combinatorial structure known as the _ secondary polytope _ or _ secondary fan _ @xcite .",
    "this structure can be studied from the point of view of a polynomial whose coefficients help to describe the fan ( really , it is the discriminant locus of this polynomial which is relevant ) , or dually , from the point of view of enumerating possible triangulations of a fixed polytope ( such as ) .",

    "it should be stressed that this computation is made purely from the point of view of the quintic itself , without reference to the mirror theory .",
    "the quantum cohomology ring also corresponds as expected from mirror symmetry .",
    "it can be precisely calculated in the gauged linear sigma model on either side ( in one case from the data of the polynomial , in the other case from the toric data , refined by analyzing the physics ) and the results agree @xcite .",
    "relating this result to the enumerative predictions involves determining an appropriate basis of cohomology ( or in physical terms , calculating the effect of renormalization ) , so one can not derive the mirror theorem directly in this way ; however , the proofs of the mirror theorem rely on similar results at some step along the way .    applying this entire set - up to the case of the general quintic",
    ", we obtain a @xmath167 matrix ; the mirror partner can be determined from the transposed @xmath168 matrix",
    ". however , the calculation of the geometry of the mirror would be formidable from this point of view .",
    "an alternative is to begin with a quintic with fewer monomials .",
    "if we start in @xmath36 with the quintic defined by , then the associated factored matrix is given by @xmath169 ( we can choose @xmath170 and @xmath171 to obtain @xmath172 and verify the conditions on the data . ) the group described by this factorization is @xmath173 .    to form the mirror ,",
    "we take the transpose : @xmath174 once again , this represents the homogeneous polynomial .",
    "however , this time the group is @xmath175 and so the calabi  yau is actually a hypersurface in a quotient space @xmath63 .",
    "kontsevich has proposed an intriguing extension of the original mirror symmetry statements , comprising what he calls the `` homological mirror conjecture '' @xcite .",
    "briefly put , kontsevich employs the khler structure to define lagrangian submanifolds of a calabi  yau manifold , and proposes that for a mirror pair @xmath0 , fukaya s @xmath176-category @xcite of lagrangian submanifolds of @xmath1 should be isomorphic to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath2 .",
    "this conjecture has proven to be very deep , with results to date being primarily about the case of elliptic curves .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent progress report . )    as the complex structure on @xmath1 is varied , the set of lagrangian submanifolds ( with respect to a fixed khler structure ) changes .",
    "in fact , upon traversing various loops in the complex structure moduli space , a large variety of monodromy transformations on the set of lagrangian submanifolds is obtained . in 1996 ,",
    "kontsevich raised the question of reproducing this effect on the other side of the proposed mirror symmetry relationship @xcite : can we generate these monodromy transformations as automorphisms of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath2 ?",
    "one source of monodromy transformations we have already seen : each element @xmath177 generates a monodromy transformation @xmath178 whose action on the even cohomology is given by @xmath179 ( the exponential is actually a finite sum , since @xmath180 for @xmath181 . )",
    "kontsevich proposed another type of monodromy transformation .",
    "consider the diagonal @xmath182 , and its ideal sheaf @xmath183 , and consider the automorphism of the derived category defined by @xmath184 the effect on cohomology , denoted by @xmath185 , can be described as @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the standard generator of @xmath188 .    in the case of a quintic hypersurface ,",
    "@xmath189 is rank one with a standard generator @xmath190 , for @xmath191 .",
    "with respect to this basis , we have matrices @xmath192 kontsevich then calculates the product of these matrices @xmath193 and observes that @xmath194 .",
    "this is a really remarkable property !",
    "it leads to the conclusion that in matching these transformations to the monodromy on the complex structure of the mirror ( see figure  [ fig : moduli ] ) , the product of @xmath195 and @xmath148 must represent the monodromy around the fermat point @xmath72 .",
    "since the matrix @xmath195 is known to represent the monodromy around the large complex structure limit point @xmath70 , @xmath148 must represent the monodromy around the point @xmath71 . we have thus found a natural way to describe this latter monodromy transformation .",
    "this is a very explicit indication of how mirror symmetry will reflect the structure of the complex structure moduli space far from the small corners in which mirror symmetry predictions are usually made .",
    "more generally , kontsevich suggests beginning with a holomorphic bundle @xmath196 on @xmath1 , and defining an associated sheaf @xmath197 on @xmath198 ( with support on @xmath199 ) as the kernel of the natural map @xmath200 there is then an endomorphism of the derived category defined by @xmath201 this will actually be an automorphism provided that @xmath196 satisfies @xmath202 in particular , @xmath203 will give an automorphism of @xmath1 is @xmath1 is a `` proper '' calabi  yau manifold , i.e. , one whose only convariantly constant holomorphic forms are a @xmath204-form and an @xmath21-form .",
    "the description sketched above has been made much more precise in @xcite .",
    "in particular , seidel and thomas @xcite discovered a beautiful formula which shows that the derived category admits actions of the braid group , which are mirror to dehn twists along lagrangian spheres in the mirror manifold .",
    "see @xcite for a concise description of how this is related to the mirror conjectures .    on the other hand , horja @xcite generalized kontsevich s picture in a different way , and found a construction of automorphisms of the derived category in the case of hypersurfaces in toric varieties which is closely connected to the structure of the ambient toric variety .",
    "kontsevich s computation given above suggests that the case @xmath203 will generate an automorphism of the derived category which is mirror to the monodromy about a loop which surrounds the `` principal component '' of the discriminant locus .",
    "there are other components of the discriminant locus , however , and each one is associated to a specific subset @xmath205 of the toric variety @xmath206 , and to a mapping @xmath207 which contracts @xmath205 to some subset @xmath208 .",
    "( in the case of the `` principal component '' , the subset is @xmath209 and the contraction is the map from @xmath206 to a point , with @xmath210=@xmath211=@xmath212 . )",
    "horja shows that an appropriate sheaf on the fiber product @xmath213 can be used to generate an automorphism of the derived category of @xmath1 . in examples and special cases",
    ", he can check that this coincides with the monodromy of periods on the mirror around the corresponding component of the discriminant .",
    "in 1996 , a new geometric property of mirror pairs was deduced from physics by strominger , yau , and zaslow @xcite , through the study of so - called _ d - branes_. this new property provides a purely geometric way to define mirror pairs @xcite , at least in principle .",
    "unfortunately , our ability to calculate with the geometric structures involved is very limited at present , and this new `` geometric mirrror symmetry '' has not yet been fully connected up with other constructions .",
    "geometric mirror symmetry has been analyzed in detail for the `` borcea  voisin threefolds '' @xcite , and some progress has been made in understanding the relationship between geometric mirror symmetry and batyrev s mirror symmetry for toric hypersurfaces or the gauged linear sigma model .",
    "the strominger  yau ",
    "zaslow property is formulated in terms of the `` special lagrangian submanifolds '' of a calabi  yau manifold @xmath1 .",
    "every calabi ",
    "yau manifold of dimension @xmath19 , when equipped with a calabi ",
    "yau metric , admits both a covariantly constant khler form @xmath214 ( the existence of which reduces the holonomy from @xmath215 to @xmath216 ) and a covariantly constant complex @xmath21-form @xmath217 ( the existence of which further reduces the holonomy to @xmath20 ) .",

    "yau manifolds are known .",

    ", we can still make the following definition .",
    "a _ geometric mirror pair _ is a pair @xmath0 of manifolds equipped with calabi ",
    "yau metrics for which there are proper maps @xmath225 and @xmath226 to an @xmath21-manifold @xmath5 , the general fibers of which are special lagrangian @xmath21-tori ; moreover , the @xmath21-tori @xmath227 and @xmath228 for generic @xmath229 should be _",

    "this definition makes no mention of @xmath5-fields , but they can also be included in a natural way @xcite .    in the case of elliptic curves ( @xmath231 ) , the metric is flat and a special lagrangian @xmath232 is just a closed geodesic .",
    "as is well known , if the homology class is fixed then there is a fibration of the elliptic curve over @xmath232 by closed geodesics in the specified class , with no singular fibers .    in the case of k3 surfaces ( @xmath233 ) , every special lagrangian @xmath234-fibration can be interpreted @xcite as a holomorphic elliptic fibration for an approriate complex structure on the k3 surface , compatible with the given ricci - flat metric .",
    "( in fact , any generic ricci - flat metric on a k3 surface admits such a fibration @xcite . ) in this case , thanks to work of kodaira @xcite , a complete classification of possible singular fibers is known : they are characterized by the conjugacy class of the monodromy action on @xmath235 . the simplest fibers , called _",
    "semistable _ , are associated to unipotent monodromy transformations . in an appropriate basis",
    ", the monodromy matrix takes the form @xmath236 for the generic elliptic fibration on a k3 surface , there are exactly @xmath237 semistable fibers , each with @xmath238 .",
    "the mirror partner of a given k3 surface ( with a fixed ricci - flat metric ) is another k3 surface with a different ricci - flat metric .",
    "the monodromy matrices @xmath221 are replaced by @xmath239 ; since this is congruent to @xmath221 , the monodromy data does not change .",
    "in fact , it can be checked @xcite ( appealing to some work of mukai @xcite ) that this mapping of geometric mirror partners is precisely the same one mentioned in section  [ sec : duality ] , whose existence was originally inferred from other considerations in physics .    in higher dimension ,",
    "we are severely hampered at present by our lack of tools for constructing and manipulating special lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "however , assuming the existence of a special lagrangian @xmath240-fibration , and assuming that for generic choices of calabi  yau metric the fibration will have very generic monodromy behavior , it is possible to analyze that behavior and obtain a clear picture of the topology of the fibration .",
    "this program has been carried out explicitly for the quintic threefold @xcite .",
    "generic topological @xmath241-fibrations on calabi  yau threefolds take the following form .- fibrations of a k3 surfaces which have exactly 24 singular fibers of the simplest type . ] the base of the fibration @xmath5 is a @xmath23-sphere , and the discriminant locus ( where the @xmath241 fibers become singular ) forms a graph @xmath242 on @xmath5 .",
    "the edges of @xmath242 correspond to degenerations which do not affect some particular @xmath232 within @xmath241 , and look like the product of the @xmath238 degeneration of elliptic curves with a cylinder ( the cylinder being the product of the given edge and the unaffected @xmath232 ) . in particular ,",

    "the `` type @xmath248 '' or `` type iii '' vertices this is reversed : the monodromy actions on @xmath245 have fixed planes whose intersection is @xmath247-dimensional , while the monodromy actions on @xmath246 have a common @xmath24-dimensional fixed plane .",
    "the graphs associated to generic @xmath241-fibrations on a quintic threefold contain 250 vertices of type @xmath244 and 50 vertices of type @xmath248 , joined by a total of 450 edges .",
    "a portion of one such graph , showing 25 vertices of the type @xmath244 vertices and 15 of the type @xmath248 vertices , is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "( this corresponds to the toric diagram on the right side of figure  [ fig1 ] . )",
    "we warn the reader that although the portion we illustrate is a planar graph , the overall graph is _ not _ planar .",
    "the combinatorics of the graph depend on both a triagulation of the original gorenstein cone , and of its dual .",
    "in particular , if we change the triangulation we get a different graph .",
    "gross has analyzed this change in detail @xcite , and shows that the same combinatorics which appears in analyzing a toric flop also governs the change of graph for the @xmath241-fibration .",
    "mirror symmetry replaces each monodromy transformation @xmath221 with the transformation @xmath239 .",
    "this has the geometric effect of exchanging the two types of vertex , replacing a type @xmath244 vertex with one of type @xmath248 , and vice versa .",
