    "the first evidence of ultra high - energy neutrinos ( in the @xmath0 energy range ) from extraterrestrial origin was reported by the icecube collaboration @xcite .",
    "this opened a new field in astroparticle physics that will allow the identification and characterization of the most powerful particle accelerators in the universe .",
    "neutrinos are not affected by the electromagnetic or strong interactions , and thus point back to the source where they were produced , unlike charged cosmic rays .",
    "gamma - rays are another cosmic probe that provides information about the acceleration mechanisms that occur in astrophysical sources . due to this",
    ", there are several dedicated instruments , both ground or space based , performing a continuous survey of the universe characterizing gamma - ray sources , e.g. the fermi gamma - ray space telescope and the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes h.e.s.s . , magic , veritas and fact .",
    "+ the hawc observatory was designed to detect and characterize the sources of high - energy gamma - rays in the energy range between 100 @xmath2 and 100 @xmath3 @xcite and started full operations in april 2015 .",
    "it is a ground based instrument that detects atmospheric showers by measuring with high precision the arrival time of the particles that compose the showers .",
    "this is done via the cherenkov light produced by the air shower particles as they enter the 300 water detector tanks that constitute the observatory , with a total water volume of 54 million @xmath4 . at energies above 100 @xmath3 ,",
    "gamma - rays suffer strong absorption from pair production with photons from the cosmic microwave background radiation that strongly reduces their mean free path @xcite .",
    "for this reason , ultra high - energy neutrinos may be a better tool to study the most energetic extra - galactic particle accelerators .",
    "+ the earth - skimming technique to detect ultra - high energy neutrinos has been proposed before , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the method consist on using the interaction between a neutrino and a nucleon via the exchange of a w@xmath5 boson to produce a charged lepton of the same flavour as the incoming neutrino .",
    "since the neutrino - nucleon cross section is very small , a large - mass target is needed .",
    "the natural candidate to produce such interactions is the earth crust , either by focusing the searches on quasi - horizontal neutrinos that travel along a chord inside the earth or by using mountains as targets .",
    "the produced charged lepton travels essentially in the same direction as the neutrino .",
    "thus , in the considered scheme , the charged lepton will travel either upward if it was moving through a chord inside the earth crust or quasi horizontally if the neutrino passed through a mountain .",
    "+ from the three families of leptons , the electron neutrinos are unfavourable for this type of study because the produced high - energy electrons initiate electromagnetic showers that are easily absorbed by the target mass shortly after production . for @xmath6 neutrinos ,",
    "the relatively large mean life of the produced charged lepton combined with the ultra - high energy will produce a detectable signal only as an ultra - energetic @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 neutrinos are the ones that have attracted more interest from the experimental point of view .",
    "the reason is that , because of their very short mean life , even if they are very energetic they will decay producing secondary particles that would make the detection of the signal easier .",
    "however , the @xmath7 neutrinos have proven to be one of the most elusive particles of the standard model , with less than 15 detections up to now @xcite .",
    "ultra high energy @xmath7 neutrinos ( with searches up to 72 @xmath0 ) have eluded direct detection so far , even after the analysis of three years of icecube data @xcite .",
    "even though @xmath7 neutrinos are disfavoured in production mechanisms at the astrophysical acceleration sites , the neutrino flavour mixing that occurs in cosmological distances is expected to produce approximately equal proportions of all neutrino flavours at the earth .",
    "+ there have been already experimental attempts to detect ultra - high energy neutrinos using the earth - skimming technique . for instance",
    ", the pierre auger observatory in argentina used their surface detectors to look for the electromagnetic signature of extensive air showers initiated by the decay of @xmath7 charged leptons of @xmath8 energies that develop close to the detector @xcite , without finding candidate signals so far .",
    "there are also studies that propose to use the fluorescence detector of the pierre auger observatory to detect the decay in the atmosphere of @xmath7 charged leptons produced by ultra - high energy neutrinos @xcite ; however this idea has not been implemented yet .",
    "the ashra-1 collaboration @xcite searched for neutrino emission from a grb in the @xmath0-@xmath8 energy range using the earth - skimming technique .",
    "the ashra-1 experiment , located on the mauna loa volcano and facing the mauna kea volcano in the hawaii island , aimed to detect @xmath7 neutrinos that converted into @xmath7 charged leptons inside mauna kea .",
    "their method consisted on measuring the cherenkov light emitted by the particles of the atmospheric shower initiated by the decay products of the @xmath7 charged lepton .",
    "their analysis of the grb081203a did not find signals associated to @xmath7 neutrinos in the @xmath0-@xmath8 energy range .",
    "there have been also studies about the feasibility to use the magic telescopes for the detection of @xmath7 neutrinos @xcite , by pointing their telescopes below the horizon towards the sea .",
    "however , no experimental results have been published yet .",
    "+ in this paper we propose to adapt the earth - skimming technique to use it with the hawc gamma - ray observatory , employing the pico de orizaba volcano as a target for the neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "however , we propose not to follow the method explored so far of studying the decay products of a @xmath7 charged lepton on the atmosphere . instead , we propose to reconstruct directly the trajectory of the charged lepton or their decay products as they travel through the hawc detectors . in this way",
    "we do not only restrict our studies to @xmath7 neutrinos , but also include the possibility for the detection of ultra - high energy @xmath6 neutrinos ( a first suggestion of this method was mentioned in @xcite ) .",
    "at ultra - high energies , the produced charged leptons will have an energy approximately equal to that of the original neutrino @xcite .",
    "these charged leptons , or their decay products , could travel crossing several hawc detectors depositing large amounts of cherenkov light , well beyond the average left by atmospheric muons ( @xmath1 30 photoelectrons ( @xmath9 ) @xcite ) far from the shower core used in the gamma / hadron discrimination algorithms of hawc .",
    "the dynamical range of the hawc electronics goes from a fraction of a @xmath10 up to thousands @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a simulation of the decay of a @xmath7 charged lepton with an energy of 100 @xmath3 shows that , although the lepton decays on average within a distance of only 5 @xmath11 after the neutrino - nucleon interaction , the highly collimated decay products ( opening angle @xmath12 @xcite ) would produce an easily identifiable core that would propagate along the hawc detectors at approximately the speed of light , even if the decay happened two kilometres away from the hawc array ( the approximate distance from the edge of the volcano to the hawc array at @xmath1 4090 @xmath11 ) .",
    "this makes the tracking method possible in the search for charged leptons in the @xmath0 energy range . the amount of cherenkov light that could be detected by the hawc pmts by such energetic particles is expected to be in the range of thousands to tens of thousands @xmath9 .",
    "however , given the dynamic range of the current hawc electronics one could anticipate that the collected light could be used as a proxy used to at least set lower boundaries on the energy of the incoming charged lepton , in a similar manner to what icecube does for muons that pass through the detector . + the paper is organized as follows : in section [ ana - calc ] we present the calculation of the flux of charged leptons that could be detected by hawc . in section [ ef - area ] , we described a method to calculate the effective area based on purely geometrical considerations , and evaluate it for different trigger conditions .",
    "then , in section [ results ] , we present our results for the possible detection rate and address the issue of the expected background signals .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in order to obtain an estimate of the number of ultra - high energy charged leptons that could be produced via the earth - skimming technique , we follow the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "however we use further simplifications due to the detection method we propose in this paper , and also because of the energy of the neutrinos that we plan to study .",
    "the differences between the original formalism of @xcite and our implementation are pointed out in the text . + the number of charged leptons ( @xmath13 ) that could be detected by the observatory is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the charged lepton flux , @xmath16 is the effective area of the observatory , @xmath17 is the live time of the experiment and @xmath18 is the duty cycle for observations , which basically describes which fraction of the time @xmath17 the experiment is actually able to take data . in this section",
    "we describe the calculation of the flux of charged leptons @xmath19 produced by the neutrino - nucleon interactions that occur while the neutrinos traverse the volcano .",
    "we start with the differential flux of ultra - high energy neutrinos produced by astrophysical sources , which we consider to be isotropic .",
    "this differential flux is given by    @xmath20    with ( @xmath21 ) the energy , polar and azimuthal angle of the neutrinos respectively .",
    "since we are interested on integrating the flux on only a certain region ( the one covered by the pico de orizaba volcano ) , and because we are considering an isotropic flux , we can simplify the differential neutrino flux to    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the solid angle covered by the volcano that is being used as the target for the neutrino - nucleon interaction .",
    "after the proposed isotropic neutrino flux passes through the pico de orizaba volcano , the produced differential charged lepton flux is given by    @xmath24    with ( @xmath25 ) the energy , polar and azimuthal angle of the charged leptons .",
    "the relation between the differential fluxes of incoming neutrinos and the produced charged leptons is thus given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a function that physically represents the convolution of the probabilities of the different processes that need to take place so that an ultra - high energy neutrino converts into a charged lepton inside the target material and is able to escape the mountain .",
    "given that we are interested in studying ultra - high energy neutrinos ( @xmath28 ) , the first simplification comes from the fact that the produced charged lepton will approximately follow the same direction as the original neutrino .",
    "the angle between the original neutrino and the produced charged lepton ( @xmath29 ) has been estimated to be smaller than 1 @xmath30 for energies above 1 @xmath0 for @xmath7 s @xcite ; so , we expect this angle to be negligible .",
    "this makes that the angular dependence of @xmath27 can be replaced approximately by delta functions .",
    "@xmath31    the energy dependent part of the @xmath27 function can be written as the integral along the path of the neutrino and the corresponding charged lepton inside the volcano    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the survival probability for a neutrino travelling a certain distance inside the volcano .",
    "this probability can be written as    @xmath34\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the charged current interaction length .",
    "since the average width of the volcano ( @xmath36 ) is much smaller than the interaction length , almost all of the neutrinos will traverse the whole mountain . that defines the integration limit of equation [ eq7 ] .",
    "the interaction length is a function of the density of the medium that the neutrino travels through . in the case of the formalism developed in @xcite , where the trajectories of the neutrinos were across chords inside earth , they had to consider variations of the earth density .",
    "in this particular case , since we are interested on neutrinos that travel through volcanoes , it is reasonable to consider a constant density @xmath37 along the path of the neutrinos .",
    "thus , the expression for the charged current interaction length can be written as follows    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is avogadro s constant and @xmath40 is the charged current cross section .",
    "the second probability ( @xmath41 ) that enters the calculation of @xmath27 is that of a neutrino to convert into a charged lepton through a charged current in an infinitesimal distance @xmath42 .",
    "this probability is given by    @xmath43    the third process ( @xmath44 ) that is taken into account in the @xmath27 function is the probability that the produced charged lepton is able to escape the volcano , taking into account the charged lepton energy losses in the medium .",
    "this process is described by a system of two coupled differential equations :    @xmath45    @xmath46    where equation [ eq9b ] describes the energy loss processes , with @xmath47 describing the ionization energy loss and @xmath48 the radiative energy loss . according to the literature , e.g. @xcite , the effects of @xmath47 are negligible at the energy regime of interest of this work",
    "; so , we consider in equation [ eq9b ] that @xmath49 . in equation",
    "[ eq9c ] , @xmath50 is the mass of the charged lepton , @xmath51 is the speed of light and @xmath52 is the charged lepton lifetime .",
    "a monte carlo study from @xcite shows that for @xmath6 s with energies of 1 @xmath0 , @xmath53 after 6 @xmath54 water equivalent ( @xmath55 ) ( 6 @xmath56 @xmath1 2.3 @xmath54 in  standard rock \" , the average path length inside the volcano ) , i.e. in the extreme case where the charged lepton has to travel the average width of the volcano , and this value approaches unity as the energy of the @xmath6 increases .",
    "the case of the survival probability for @xmath7 s is more complicated to evaluate , since most of the research has been done for energies above or at 100 @xmath0 @xcite . due to the energies we are interested in this work , even for @xmath7 s the value of this probability can also reach values close to one .",
    "according to @xcite , for @xmath57 @xmath8 , @xmath58 and for @xmath59 @xmath8 , p@xmath60 after 2.3 @xmath54 in  standard rock \" , i.e. in the extreme case where the @xmath7 s are produced just after entering the volcano .",
    "thus , even though these values are for higher energies to those that are considered in this work , we consider that it is safe to take as a first approximation that @xmath7 charged leptons with @xmath61 10 @xmath0 will have a @xmath44 close to unity . in the following",
    ", we will use the approximation that for both @xmath6 s and @xmath7 s @xmath62 .",
    "finally , the factor @xmath63 makes sure that the charged lepton escapes the volume of the volcano with an energy @xmath64 . based on equation [ eq9b ] ,",
    "taking @xmath65 , then @xmath63 can be written as    @xmath66 ) \\ ] ]    thus , we can approximate the @xmath27 function as    @xmath67    and after evaluating the integral we obtain an expression for the @xmath27 function .",
    "@xmath68\\frac{1}{\\beta_{l}\\rho e_{l}}\\ ] ]    equation [ eq12 ] is valid in the case where we neglect variations of the density of the volcano and that @xmath62 .",
    "going back to equation [ eq4 ] , we can substitute equation [ eq5 ] and equation [ eq12 ] on it . by doing this , we obtain an equation for the differential flux with respect to the energy of the leptons    @xmath69\\ ] ]    the next step is to define a functional form for the differential flux of neutrinos as a function of energy . for this",
    ", we use the parametrization of the measured astrophysical neutrino flux made by the icecube collaboration @xcite , which has been found to be well described by an unbroken power law    @xmath70    we choose to use the parametrization presented in @xcite for the measurement of the @xmath71 astrophysical flux . for this particular parametrization",
    "we shifted the mean values of the normalization and spectral index in order to obtain the highest flux , but within the allowed range given by their statistical uncertainties .",
    "these values are : @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we assume for our calculations an expected equal contribution to the astrophysical flux for @xmath75 , due to the neutrino flavour mixing over cosmological distances that would produce approximately equal proportions of all flavours .",
    "then , we extrapolate the measured flux to the energy range 10 @xmath0 to 100 @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , motivated by the most energetic event found by the diffuse flux muon neutrino search ( 2009 - 2015 ) done by icecube ( a track event that deposited @xmath76 in the sensible volume of the detector @xcite ) , we also include in the flux estimations the models proposed in @xcite , which account for sources of multi-@xmath0 neutrinos that are constrained by the most recent ultra high energy neutrino upper limits set by icecube @xcite and pierre auger @xcite .",

    "we presented an estimate of the detection capabilities of the hawc observatory to study ultra - high energy neutrinos interacting in the pico de orizaba volcano .",
    "we based our study in the analytic method developed in @xcite and modified it to a simpler case where the neutrino conversion takes place inside a medium of constant density .",
    "the effective area of the hawc observatory for the detection of ultra - high energy charged leptons was calculated geometrically for different trigger conditions .",
    "we used the astrophysical neutrino flux measured by icecube @xcite and extrapolated it to energy range from 10 @xmath0 up to 100 @xmath8 , and also considered models for multi-@xmath0 neutrinos @xcite that are constrained by the most recent data from icecube@xcite and pierre auger @xcite . with this",
    ", we found that in order to find a signal consistent with the propagation of an ultra - high energy charged lepton coming from the direction of the pico de orizaba volcano , will take approximately five years if the signal is required to propagate in four wcds of hawc .",
    "we estimated the expected background for this analysis using the measured atmospheric muon flux above 15 @xmath3 @xcite , and found that it should be feasible to perform this study with a reasonable signal to background ratio during the lifetime of the hawc observatory .",
    "we also showed that the current software trigger used by hawc should be sufficient to acquire data for this analysis .",
    "+ the detection rate should be taken with caution since there are several quantities that are uncertain to at least some degree , such as the flux of neutrinos at that energy , the neutrino - nucleon cross section , and the parameters that describes the radiative energy loss processes for the leptons traversing the earth crust .",
    "however we also did not consider scenarios where the neutrino - nucleon cross section at ultra - high energies could have enhanced values relative to the standard model predictions , due to the presence of new physics , as described for instance in @xcite .",
