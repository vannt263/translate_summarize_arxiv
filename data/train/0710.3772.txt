    "brown @xcite were among the first to observe an excess power between 0.5 and 1.5 mhz in radial velocity observations confirmed by several other radial velocity studies , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so far these studies have independently revealed detections of power excess , but there is no agreement yet on the actual oscillation frequencies .",
    "this may be due to aliases present in the spectral window , short mode lifetimes , shifts from the asymptotic relation due to avoided crossings , or any combination of these factors .",

    "other photometric studies such as wire @xcite and a reanalysis of the most 2004 data @xcite claim to detect power excess in the same region as the radial velocity studies .",
    "a recent reanalysis of the most 2004 data and the analysis of new most data taken in 2005 reinforce the null detection of p - modes @xcite .",
    "this issue is discussed more extensively by @xcite , who claim that the non - detection of oscillations in procyon by the most satellite is fully consistent with the ground based radial - velocity studies due to a combination of several noise sources and the low photometric amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "procyon a is in a very interesting evolutionary state near the end of its main sequence life .",
    "the stellar parameters ( see table  [ stelpar ] ) are all known to high precision , but several evolutionary tracks with different ages and different hydrogen core mass fractions overlap , within the errors , with its position in the hr - diagram . the exact evolutionary state of a star can be revealed by means of asteroseismology and therefore the oscillation frequencies are needed .    to determine the actual frequencies of procyon a a ground - based multi - site campaign using 10 telescopes with a total time span of nearly 4 weeks was performed from december 28 , 2006 till january 22 , 2007 . here",
