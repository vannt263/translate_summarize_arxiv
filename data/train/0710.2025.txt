    "<S> we have combined neutron scattering and piezoresponse force microscopy to study the relation between the exchange bias observed in cofeb / bifeo@xmath0 heterostructures and the multiferroic domain structure of the bifeo@xmath0 films . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the exchange field scales with the inverse of the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domain size , as expected from malozemoff s model of exchange bias extended to multiferroics . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , polarized neutron reflectometry reveals the presence of uncompensated spins in the bifeo@xmath0 film at the interface with the cofeb . in view of these results we discuss possible strategies to switch the magnetization of a ferromagnet by an electric field using bifeo@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the renaissance of multiferroics @xcite , i.e. materials in which at least two ferroic or antiferroic orders coexist , is motivated by fundamental aspects as well as their possible application in spintronics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such compounds are rare and the very few that possess simultaneously a finite magnetization and polarization usually order below about 100k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ferroelectric antiferromagnets ( feaf ) are less scarce , and some exhibit a coupling between their two order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling allows the reversal of the ferroelectric ( fe ) polarization by a magnetic field @xcite or the control of the magnetic order parameter by an electric field @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the practical interest of conventional antiferromagnets ( af ) is mainly for exchange bias in spin - valve structures . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of exchange bias ( eb ) @xcite manifests itself by a shift in the hysteresis loop of a ferromagnet ( fm ) in contact with an af and arises from the exchange coupling at the fm / af interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> combining this effect with the me coupling in a feaf / fm bilayer can allow the reversal of the fm magnetization via the application of an electric field through the feaf , as reported recently at 2k in ymno@xmath0/nife structures @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to exploit these functionalities in devices one needs to resort to feaf materials with high transition temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> bifeo@xmath0 ( bfo ) is a fe perovskite with a curie temperature of 1043k @xcite that orders antiferromagnetically below t@xmath1=643k ( t@xmath1 : nel temperature ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bfo thin films have a very low magnetization ( @xmath20.01 @xmath3/fe ) compatible with an af order @xcite , and remarkable fe properties with polarization values up to 100 @xmath4c.@xmath5 range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we reported that bfo films can be used to induce an eb on adjacent cofeb layers at room temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation together with the demonstration of a coupling between the af and fe domains @xcite paves the way towards the room - temperature electrical control of magnetization with bfo . </S>",
    "<S> however , several questions remain before this can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> key issues concern the precise magnetic structure of bfo thin films , and the mechanisms of eb in bfo - based heterostructures .    in this letter , we report on the determination of the magnetic structure of bfo films by means of neutron diffraction ( nd ) , and the analysis of the eb effect in cofeb / bfo heterostructures in terms of malozemoff s model @xcite . accordingly , we find a clear dependence of the amplitude of the exchange field h@xmath6 with the size of the multiferroic domains , which provides a handle to control the magnetization of the cofeb film by an electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of eb and enhanced coercivity correlates with the presence of uncompensated spins at the interface between the fm and the af , as detected by polarized neutron reflectometry ( pnr ) .    </S>",
    "<S> bifeo@xmath0 films were grown by pulsed laser deposition @xcite , directly onto ( 001)- or ( 111)-oriented srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) or ( 001)-oriented laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) substrates , or onto 10 - 25 nm - thick metallic buffers of la@xmath7sr@xmath8mno@xmath0 ( lsmo ) or srruo@xmath0 ( sro ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 7.5 nm - thick cofeb layers were sputtered in a separate chamber at 300k in a magnetic field of 200 oe , after a short plasma cleaning . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were capped by 10 - 30 nm of au . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution x - ray diffraction evidenced a cube - on - cube growth for all the perovskite layers onto the substrates . </S>",
    "<S> cofeb was amorphous . while the ( 111)-oriented films were found to be rhombohedral as bulk bfo @xcite , ( 001)-oriented films were found tetragonal or monoclinic @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a first key information that is usually required to analyze eb is the magnetic structure of the af . </S>",
    "<S> bulk bfo is known to have a g - type af order @xcite , with a superimposed cycloidal modulation @xcite . in view of the strong strain sensitivity of the properties of fe and magnetic oxides </S>",

    "<S> [ neutrons - mh]a and b , we show the diffracted intensity at the [ ] reflection in bfo films grown on ( 001)- and ( 111)-oriented sto . </S>",
    "<S> clearly an af peak is present for both films . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> no intensity was measured at [ 0 0 ] -type or [ 0]-type reflections , characteristic of a - type and c - type antiferromagnetism , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these data thus show that both ( 001)- and ( 111)-oriented films are antiferromagnetic with a g - type order similar to that of the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , neither strain nor changes in the unit - cell symmetry modify the type of magnetic order , besides destroying the cycloidal modulation ( see ref . for details on this aspect ) .    within a simplistic model of eb </S>",

    "<S> the loops are shifted towards negative magnetic field values by an exchange field h@xmath6 of -39 oe for ( 001 ) films and -19 oe for ( 111 ) films . furthermore the loops are enlarged by some tens of oe compared to those measured on cofeb single films @xcite . from m(h ) data for lsmo / bfo / cofeb samples ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> for a given thickness , the exchange field experienced by the cofeb is virtually the same irrespective of the presence of the lsmo buffer layer .    </S>",
    "<S> malozemoff s random field model @xcite has been proposed to resolve the long - standing discrepancy between the model of eq.([he ] ) and the experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it considers that in the presence of some atomic - scale disorder that locally creates a net magnetization in the af at the interface with the fm , the af splits into domains , which decreases considerably the interface coupling that now writes :    @xmath24    l is the antiferromagnetic domain size and @xmath25 a factor depending on the shape of the domains and on the average number @xmath26 of frustrated interaction paths for each uncompensated surface spin @xcite . for hemispherical bubble domains , @xmath27 and @xmath26 </S>",

    "<S> a second set consists of bfo films with varying thickness ( 5 nm @xmath30 240 nm ) grown on lsmo//sto(001 ) . in bfo , since the polarization is oriented along the @xmath31111@xmath32 directions there generally exist 8 possible polarization orientation variants . </S>",

    "<S> the pnr measurements were carried out with the prism instrument of the llb at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> spin - up and spin - down reflectivities ( r@xmath40 and r@xmath38 ) were collected and the data were corrected for the polarization efficiency . </S>",

    "<S> the structural parameters of the layers were first determined by fitting x - ray reflectometry data ( not shown ) . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the results for a au(30nm)/cofeb(7.5nm)/bfo(18nm)//sto(001 ) sample displaying an eb of 18 oe and in which the cofeb / bfo interface has a roughness of only 0.5 nm , yielding high quality reflectivity data .    </S>",

    "<S> [ refl]a ) we only consider the presence of three layers , i.e. au , cofeb and bfo . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit is obtained for the structure au(31.0@xmath39nm)/cofeb(7.0@xmath39nm)/bfo(18@xmath39 nm ) with zero magnetization in the bfo and au layers , and a magnetization of 1@xmath41 @xmath3/f.u . for the cofeb . as can be appreciated , </S>",
    "<S> the fit is good but not perfect ( see arrows ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fit quality is significantly improved , especially at high @xmath42 , by using a four - layer model , i.e. splitting the bfo layer in two . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit is then obtained if a 2@xmath39 nm layer carrying a magnetic moment of 1@xmath39@xmath3/f.u . </S>",
    "<S> is present in the bfo , at the interface with the cofeb . </S>",
    "<S> this ultrathin magnetic layer inside the bfo accounts for the presence of a large density of uncompensated spins ( corresponding to a surface moment m@xmath43=31.8 @xmath3.nm@xmath44 ) at the bfo / cofeb interface , similarly to results reported on the co / lafeo@xmath0 exchange bias system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the expected surface moment due to pinned uncompensated spins within malozemoff s model is m@xmath45=2s@xmath13/al@xmath460.32 @xmath3.nm@xmath44 , which represents only a small fraction of the surface moment measured by pnr . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of uncompensated spins is thus unpinned ( as observed by x - ray magnetic circular dichroism in co / irmn @xcite ) and rotates with the cofeb , producing an increase of the coercive field , as found experimentally ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ neutrons - mh ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this observation suggests that two different , yet possibly related and complementary , strategies are possible to tune the magnetic switching fields of the ferromagnet electrically . </S>",
    "<S> one would rely on the manipulation of the pinned uncompensated spins to modify the exchange field h@xmath6 , e.g. by changing the domain size that should be controllable by ad - hoc electrical writing procedures . </S>",
    "<S> the other could consist in controlling the unpinned uncompensated spins in order to alter the coercive field h@xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this might be achieved by modifying the effective surface anisotropy of the af , for instance by playing with the ferroelastic energy of the domains , which would change the magnetoelastic contribution to the anisotropy .    in summary , we analyzed the exchange bias in the cofeb / bifeo@xmath0 system and found that the exchange field does not correlate with the type of magnetic surface of the antiferromagnet - compensated or uncompensated . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the exchange field scales with the inverse of the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domain size in the multiferroic bifeo@xmath0 film , as expected from malozemoff s model that we extend for the first time to the case of ferroelectric antiferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> polarized neutron reflectometry measurements reveal the presence of a net magnetic moment within a @xmath22 nm slab in the bfo at the interface with the cofeb , reflecting the presence of uncompensated spins in the bifeo@xmath0 , consistent with the observation of exchange bias and enhanced coercivity . as the ferroelectric domain structure </S>",
    "<S> can be easily controlled by an electric field , our results strongly suggest that the electrical manipulation of magnetization should be feasible at room temperature in bfo - based exchange - bias heterostructures . </S>"
