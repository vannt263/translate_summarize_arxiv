    "single molecule kinetics has come within reach of biophysical experiments @xcite , and theoretical and computational tools for analysis of such processes have experienced a corresponding growth @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the combinatorially large number of microscopic steps involved in even the simplest of biochemical events makes their rigorous stochastic treatment difficult .",
    "for example , gene expression , often modeled as a single - step mrna creation , in fact , includes transcription - factor - dna binding , polymerase recruitment , transcriptional bubble formation , and multiple elongation steps , each of which is a complex process on its own .",
    "therefore , any theoretical analysis of stochastic biochemical processes necessarily involves coarse - graining : identifying a small subset of dynamical variables that are modeled explicitly , while agglomerating the rest into an effective behaviour .",
    "such coarse - grained dynamics is often modeled using the master equation or the langevin approaches , which require markoviness or white - noise random forcing .",
    "both of these assumptions are , generally , flawed , and _ quantitative _ corrections have been worked out in certain cases @xcite .",
    "less explored is the possibility that internal degrees of freedom can introduce _ qualitative _ differences , such as long - range temporal correlations among state transitions and non - diffusive behaviour of the observed quantities .",
    "a well - studied example shows that this is possible for a random walk on a discrete lattice . in ref .",
    "@xcite , weiss and havlin analyzed a two - dimensional diffusion model , known as the _ comb _ model .",
    "there dynamics along the @xmath0 coordinate is unlimited , while motion along @xmath1 is allowed only when @xmath2 .",
    "this results in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that is , in a sub - diffusive motion of @xmath1 . this model is hardly realistic in a biochemical context due to the discontinuous dependence of the diffusion coefficient on @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is plausible that diffusive dynamics of a real biological or chemical variable in the state space or in the physical space depends on unobserved , decimated variables in some other non - trivial way .",
    "for example , in a chemotaxing _ e. coli _ , the number of unobserved signaling proteins chey - p is coupled to the distribution of times a bacterial motor rotates counterclockwise , and the bacterium swims straight . for a fixed concentration of chey - p , obtained by modifying the chemotaxis network , the distribution is essentially exponential @xcite , resulting in a regular diffusive motion of the bacterium .",
    "but in a wild - type bacterium , as the number of chey - p fluctuates ( diffuses in the number space even for a constant external signal ) , the distribution becomes a power law , and bacteria exhibit super - diffusive real - space motion . while not true in this particular system , the distribution of clockwise rotation times could have been strongly coupled to chey - p as well .",
    "this would have resulted in a power law distribution of times that the bacterium spends reorienting itself without moving forward , and hence in its sub - diffusive motion . in both cases , neglecting the chey - p fluctuations and describing bacterial motion as a normal diffusion is qualitatively wrong .    in this paper",
    ", we abstract out the detailed biology and explore these types of phenomena from the point of view of statistical physics .",
    "we derive the properties of a diffusion process , for which the diffusion coefficient depends on the state of another , unobserved , variable .",
    "we show that , quite generally , such dependence leads to anomalous diffusion of the observed process , suggesting that traditional stochastic approaches may fail , and that more thought should be given to modeling stochastic phenomena in complex interacting systems , in particular in biophysics .",
    "our model is described by two variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which may represent , in particular , concentrations of two interacting chemical species .",
    "the @xmath1 is considered as the observed quantity , while @xmath0 is assumed hidden ( i.e. , unobserved ) .",
    "particles of both species can be created and destroyed , which results in an over - damped diffusive motion of the system in the concentration space ( we disregard the directional drift for simplicity , but it can be reintroduced easily ) .",
    "we assume that the diffusion of @xmath1 is @xmath0-dependent .",
    "that is , @xmath5 here @xmath6 are the effective friction coefficients ( assumed to be homogeneous ) corresponding to @xmath7 ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent , zero - mean white noise forces such that @xmath10 the idea of multiplicative noise was explored before . in @xcite the authors considered the case of a langevin process ( not over - damped ) , in which a function of the velocity serves as a `` filter '' for the white noise . in @xcite",
    "the multiplicative noise enters as a random friction coefficient ; however , the distribution of the random friction is independent of time .",
    "similarly in @xcite the noise enters as a random mass with distribution which is again independent of time .",
    "our model is different from the above mentioned models since the distribution of the random coupling parameter @xmath11 is time dependent ; moreover it depends in an arbitrary way ( through the function @xmath11 ) on _ another _ variable , which diffuses and hence has long range temporal correlations .",
    "further , the coupling considered in our model does not introduce a directional bias since it is multiplied by a white noise @xmath12 , which takes both positive and negative values .",
    "the pdf of @xmath0 is that of a normal diffusion @xmath13 where the initial condition is @xmath14 .",
    "the dynamics of the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xmath15 , where @xmath16 stands for the average over the white noises @xmath17 and @xmath12 , can be derived . formally integrating and substituting it in the expression for the derivative of @xmath18 yields , @xmath19 averaging over the noise @xmath20 yields the dynamics of the msd of @xmath1 conditional on @xmath21 , @xmath22 to get the marginal expectation @xmath23 , we now average the conditional expectation over @xmath0 , which is distributed as in : @xmath24    the function @xmath11 may take different forms for different systems . the simplest case is when the dynamics of @xmath1 is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath25 . substituting this in yields the expected trivial result @xmath26 .",
    "another scenario is that @xmath1 can evolve in time only for a given range of @xmath0 values ( @xmath27 ) , which resembles the discrete comb model of weiss and havlin @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that the comb model is based on geometric constraints , i.e. , the teeth , while in our case the coupling between the two process is not due to the topology , but rather to the physical nature of the processes .",
    "the similarity arises due the fact that in both models the first passage time distribution in the infinitely long @xmath0 axis , dominate the dynamics .",
    "indeed , substituting @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a dimensionless constant , and @xmath30 is the heaviside theta function , into , we see that , for @xmath31 , @xmath32 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "if @xmath11 falls off exponentially as @xmath33 , the same sub - diffusion exponent is recovered .    .",
    "we set @xmath34 . in the left panel",
    "we used the repressive coupling of with @xmath35 to illustrate the suppression of diffusion in @xmath1 .",
    "the central panel shows the case of @xmath36 in , namely decoupled langevin processes resulting in normal diffusion . the right panel shows the case of enhanced diffusion in @xmath1 due to coupling of the form of with @xmath37 . in each of the panels",
    "the left inset shows the observable @xmath1 as a function of time and the right inset shows @xmath1 and @xmath0 scaled equally .",
    "all trajectories start at @xmath38 .",
    "the time step is set to @xmath39 and the total duration of each trajectory is @xmath40 . ]",
    "a more interesting case is when , at large @xmath0 , @xmath11 falls off , but not too sharply .",
    "we consider a power law form , namely @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant with the units of inverse length , and @xmath43 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "this is of a form of a repressive , cooperative hill kinetics , which describes many biochemical processes @xcite .",
    "typical diffusive trajectories with this @xmath11 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "assuming that the behaviour of @xmath11 for large @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath46 , a simple scaling argument suggests that @xmath47 . however , this is clearly wrong for large @xmath43 , suggesting that @xmath48 must pick up an anomalous scaling due to the @xmath49 properties of @xmath11 . in",
    "what follows , we derive the long time behaviour of @xmath48 in a more rigorous way .    with @xmath11 as in , and",
    "considering the long time limit ( @xmath50 ) gives @xmath51^{2}}dy\\right .",

    "this implies that , for @xmath62 , the long time behaviour is dominated by @xmath63 , as the scaling argument suggests .",
    "however , for @xmath64 , the scaling argument breaks and @xmath65 . note that when the @xmath66 falls faster than @xmath67 , the diffusion exponent is exactly the same as in the case in which the dynamics of @xmath1 is limited to a finite range near @xmath2 .",
    "the case of @xmath68 is special and the integral of can be calculated exactly , yielding @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the meijer g function @xcite .",
    "the leading order term of the msd is then @xmath71     defined by @xmath72 for the coupled stochastic processes model with different couplings between the diffusion of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , measured by the exponent @xmath73 . for the case of hindered diffusion of @xmath1 , , @xmath74 , while for the enhanced diffusion , , @xmath75 .",
    "numerical simulations ( points ) and theoretical predictions ( line ) agree for both scenarios . ]",
    "the coupling function @xmath11 depends only on the variable @xmath0 which undergoes normal diffusion .",
    "thus we can derive the probability distribution of @xmath11 . in order to simplify the notation , in what follows we use @xmath29 to denote the coupling function without explicitly specifying its dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath29 is given by , its probability density is : @xmath76 where @xmath77 . in the above derivation , we set @xmath78 for simplicity .",
    "we see that the distribution of the noise introduced by @xmath29 is time dependent .",
    "note that the temporal correlations of @xmath29 are also important for the dynamic properties of @xmath1 .",
    "so far we have considered only situations in which the motion of @xmath1 was slowed at large @xmath0 , but we can also consider the opposite scenarios , when large @xmath0 promotes diffusion in @xmath1 , as in @xcite : @xmath79 this now resembles the hill activation kinetics for low concentration of the substrate molecules @xcite .",
    "typical trajectories for this form of the coupling function with @xmath80 are shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .    for coupling of this form",
    ", the dynamics of the msd ( ) yields @xmath81 which , in the long time limit , gives @xmath82 , and @xmath83 the distribution of the coupling function @xmath29 in this case is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "to confirm our analytical results , we performed numerical simulations for the different cases considered above . in figure",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we present a comparison of the diffusion exponent @xmath86 ( defined by @xmath72 ) versus the coupling parameter @xmath73 ( for the sub - diffusion scenario , , @xmath74 , and for the super - diffusion scenario , , @xmath75 ) between the simulations and the analytical results . the simulations where done according to eqs .",
    "( [ ydyn ] ,  [ xdyn ] ) with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we averaged the results over @xmath90 trajectories , each of duration @xmath91 .",
    "a simple linear regression to @xmath92 was performed to estimate @xmath86 .",
    "since the standard parameter errors obtained for the regressions were negligible , the error bars of @xmath86 were estimated from the variability of the fitted values as we changed the domain of @xmath56 , for which the fits were performed .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows a clear agreement between our theoretical results and the simulations .",
    "note that , in certain cases , the convergence to the leading behaviour of @xmath93 as @xmath52 is slow since the difference between the exponents of the leading and the sub - leading terms is small .",
    "this slowness determined the lengths of the simulations .",
    "there are many models of anomalous diffusion , including a time dependent friction coefficient in the langevin equation @xcite , continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) @xcite , fractional brownian dynamics @xcite , fractional langevin dynamics @xcite and langevin dynamics with coloured noise @xcite , to name a few . for a new model resulting in an anomalous diffusion , it is important to see if it can be reduced to one of these more familiar constructions .",
    "for example , the @xmath52 behaviour of the original comb model is equivalent to ctrw @xcite with a power - law tail of the distribution of the times between successive jumps along @xmath1 .",
    "however , in our model , the analogy is not as straightforward since the continuous dynamics of @xmath0 induces temporal correlations among successive motions along @xmath1 .",
    "to understand the relation of the coupled diffusion model to the others in the literature , we note that all of them yield the same behaviour for the _ ensemble _ averaged msd in the long time limit .",
    "however , they still differ from each other in the short time behaviour , the shape of the distribution , and even in the long time behaviour of _ time _ averaged quantities ( for example , the ctrw exhibits ergodicity breaking @xcite ) . in particular , the time averaged msd ( tamsd ) is an important property ( it is the tamsd that is observed in typical single molecule diffusion experiments in biological systems @xcite , and the number of recorded trajectories is often insufficient to estimate ensemble averages ) .",
    "the tamsd is defined as @xmath94 ^ 2 d \\tau , \\label{tamsd}\\ ] ] which averages the squared displacement of a particle in time @xmath95 ( the time lag ) over a single particle trajectory of duration @xmath56 . for ctrw ,",
    "the tamsd is a random quantity and even its ensemble average still exhibits aging , that is , dependence on the measurement duration @xcite @xmath56 in . on the contrary , for the fractional brownian and langevin dynamics , the tamsd converges to the ensemble average msd for long times @xcite .",
    "we investigated the behaviour of the tamsd in our model with repressive coupling numerically .",
    "we find that , when the scaling argument holds , namely for @xmath96 ( see ) , the tamsd is not a random quantity , but it still shows aging , as we would expect for langevin dynamics with a time dependent friction . on the other hand , when @xmath97 , and the diffusion exponent is @xmath98 , the tamsd shows a similar behaviour to that of the ctrw @xcite . in figure  [ fig:3 ] ,",
    "we show the tamsd versus the time lag @xmath95 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "each line shows the tamsd for a single trajectory .",
    "the solid red lines represent trajectories of duration @xmath101 , and the dashed blue lines are for @xmath102 .",
    "all lines show a linear dependence on @xmath95 , but with different coefficients . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the tamsd lines converge as the trajectory duration grows ( the dashed blue lines essentially overlap ) , while for @xmath99 , the lines remain random .",
    "this is a clear indication of ergodicity breaking in our model for @xmath103 .",
    "further , this analysis suggests that the coupled langevin processes model stands as its own class among other anomalous diffusion models , exhibiting time - dependent diffusion coefficient langevin dynamics for certain forms of coupling , and some aspects of ergodicity - breaking ctrw for others .     versus @xmath95 for @xmath104 ( left and right panels , respectively ) .",
    "all other parameters are the same as for the previous figures .",
    "we used 20 trajectories of duration @xmath101 ( solid red lines ) and 20 trajectories of duration @xmath102 ( dashed blue lines ) .",
    "the straight lines with slope @xmath39 in the log - log scale reflect a linear dependence of the tamsd on the time lag @xmath95 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the tamsd of different trajectories converges as the measurement time increases ( the blue lines collapse , and the red do not ) , namely a time average of a single particle behaves like the ensemble average .",
    "however , for @xmath99 , there is no such convergence , just like for ctrw ( the coefficient of proportionality between @xmath105 and @xmath95 varies from trajectory to trajectory ) . in both cases , the ensemble average of the tamsd decreases as the measurement time increases , indicating aging . ]",
    "in this article , we introduced a model of coupled diffusive processes , where the diffusion of the observed variable @xmath1 is coupled to the value of a hidden variable @xmath0 .",
    "we showed that the dynamics of @xmath1 exhibits anomalous diffusion for every considered form of the coupling between the variables . depending on the nature of the coupling ,",
    "the motion of @xmath1 can be sub- or super - diffusive ( and even super - ballistic , as is the case of a frictionless particle subject to a white noise ) .",
    "further , even for an arbitrary `` strong '' ( such that the dynamics of @xmath1 is limited to a small range of @xmath0 values ) repressive @xmath106 coupling , the @xmath1 diffusion exponent @xmath86 is limited from below by @xmath107 ( anomalous scaling ) , so that localization of @xmath1 is impossible .",
    "even though the long - time ensemble - averaged behaviour of our model is similar to that of many others describing anomalous diffusion , the model does not reduce to any of them , exhibiting an effective time - dependent diffusion coefficient , aging , and ergodicity breaking for different values of its parameters .    the anomalous scaling and the ergodicity breaking appear for `` strong '' @xmath106 coupling ( i.e. , large @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is because , for @xmath62 , motion of particles away from @xmath2 contributes substantially to the ensemble averaged msd of @xmath1 . on the contrary , for @xmath64 ,",
    "only motion near @xmath2 is important , namely the first passage time in an infinite one dimensional system ( the diffusion process in @xmath0 ) plays a major role in the dynamics of the observed quantity , @xmath1 .",
    "it was also verified numerically that , for @xmath64 , where the dynamics of @xmath1 is dominated by motion in a narrow range near @xmath2 , the propagator is non - gaussian as expected from a ctrw - like renewal process .",
    "a similar result holds for the super - diffusive regime , @xmath108 . on the other hand",
    "when the motion at any @xmath0 is important ( @xmath109 ) , the process in @xmath1 has long - time correlations and the propagator takes a gaussian form ( similar to that of a diffusion process with a time dependent diffusion coefficient ) .    while important in its own right , the coupled diffusion model raises its most important questions in the biological domain .",
    "unobserved dynamical quantities lead to anomalous diffusion in _",
    "e.  coli _",
    "chemotaxis @xcite , or in mrna diffusion in cells @xcite .",
    "further , some of the best established models of cellular regulation involve coarse - graining of dynamics .",
    "for example , in some models of the _ e.  coli _ _ lac _ operon , the _ lac _ repressor itself is an unobserved variable @xcite , which is coupled to the speed of production of the lactose permease and the lactose - utilizing enzyme and , through them , to the import and the degradation of lactose in the cell .",
    "since any coupling may lead to anomalous diffusion and in some cases even to ergodicity breaking , it begs the question whether relying on the common langevin or master equation analysis of stochasticity of the _ lac _ repressor or other regulatory circuits , such as the @xmath110-phage @xcite , _ mar _",
    "@xcite , and others , is rigorously justifiable .",
    "we thank e.  barkai and a.  zilman for stimulating discussions and lanl center for nonlinear studies for support and for striving to maintain an island of sanity in the increasingly more complex environment .",
