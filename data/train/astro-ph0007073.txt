    "is one of the most unusual members of the class of dipping low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) sources exhibiting periodic dips in x - ray intensity .",
    "it is generally accepted that dipping is due to absorption in the bulge in the outer accretion disk where the accretion flow from the companion inpacts ( white & swank 1982 ) .",
    "has the longest orbital period of the dipping sources at 21@xmath92 hr ( watson et al .",
    "1985 ) , but the period has not been refined since this determination from _",
    "exosat_. dipping is deep , @xmath10 75% in the band 110 kev , and the source also exhibits strong flaring in which the x - ray flux can increase by 30% over timescales of a few thousand seconds ( church & bauciska - church 1995 ) .",
    "the depth , duration and spectral evolution in dipping vary considerably from source to source .",
    "however , spectral analysis of dipping sources provides information not available in non - dip sources . for example , spectral models are more strongly constrained by having to fit non - dip and dip data , thus showing clearly the nature of the emission . in addition , the dip ingress and egress times can be used to obtain the sizes of the extended emission regions when the absorber has larger angular extent than the source regions , thus providing information on the geometry of the accretion disk corona ( adc ) ( e.g. church et al .",
    "although the fundamental question of the nature of the emission regions in lmxb is controversial , a unifying model has been proposed for the dipping class ( church & bauciska - church 1995 ) which is able to explain the widely disparate behaviour of individual sources .",
    "the emission regions consist of the point source neutron star producing blackbody emission , and an extended comptonizing region , probably the adc .",
    "it has now been shown that this model not only can explain well the spectra of _ all _ dipping lmxb ( church et al . in preparation ) , but can also explain the spectra of all the z - track and atoll sources investigated in a recent _ asca _ survey ( church & bauciska - church 2000 ) . in a number of dipping sources , the nature of dipping was not understood because of the clear presence of an unabsorbed part of the non - dip spectrum at all levels of dipping . in these sources ,",
    "dip spectra could be modelled by dividing the non - dip spectral form into two parts : one absorbed and the other unabsorbed but with strongly decreasing normalization ( parmar et al .",
    "1986 ; courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 ; smale et al .",
    "1992 ) , ` absorbed plus unabsorbed ' modelling .",
    "it has been difficult however , to explain these normalization changes convincingly .",
    "more recently , an alternative explanation has been suggested in which an extended absorber moves across the extended and point - like emission regions , providing a natural explanation for the unabsorbed component as the uncovered emission which becomes smaller as dipping proceeds .",
    "this progressive covering model has explained spectral evolution during dipping in xb1916 - 053 , xb0748 - 676 and xb1323 - 619 ( church et al . 1997 , 1998a , b ; bauciska - church et al .",
    "1999 ) .    was previously observed in a long _ exosat _ observation of 220 ks and with _ ginga _ ( jones & watson 1989 ) .",
    "the _ exosat _ me data revealed an apparently stable lower level of dipping supporting the presence of two emission components , one of which was totally absorbed in deep dipping .",
    "a blackbody plus bremsstrahlung model was used to parameterize the spectra ( jones & watson 1989 ) .",
    "church & bauciska - church ( 1995 ; hereafter cbc95 ) showed that the light curve at higher energies ( @xmath11 5 kev ) was dominated by flaring which can strongly modify the spectrum and make the spectral investigation of dipping difficult . by selecting sections of non - dip and dip data without apparent flaring ,",
    "the above unifying blackbody plus comptonization model was found to fit the data well showing that in deep dipping the blackbody component was totally absorbed , and that the comptonized component was relatively little absorbed . however , with only one non - dip and one deep dip spectrum it was not possible to determine the extent of absorption of the comptonized component .",
    "the galactic column density of  is very high @xmath12 atom @xmath13 so that a dust scattered halo of the source is expected , and angelini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) demonstrated an excess of the surface brightness above the point spread function in _ asca _ gis .    in the present paper , we present a detailed study of dipping in x1624 - 490 and of the effects of dust scattering in this source made using _",
    "bepposax_. with the very broad band , we have been able for the first time to obtain reliably parameters of the comptonized emission .",

    "1997 ) , high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ; 5120  kev ; manzo et al . 1997 ) and the phoswich detection system ( pds ; 15300  kev ; frontera et al .",

    "all these instruments are coaligned and collectively referred to as the narrow field instruments , or nfi .",
    "the mecs consists of three identical grazing incidence telescopes with imaging gas scintillation proportional counters in their focal planes , however prior to the observation of  one of the detectors had failed .",
    "the lecs uses an identical concentrator system as the mecs , but utilizes an ultra - thin entrance window and a driftless configuration to extend the low - energy response to 0.1  kev .",
    "the non - imaging hpgspc consists of a single unit with a collimator that is alternatively rocked on- and off - source to monitor the background spectrum .",
    "the non - imaging pds consists of four independent units arranged in pairs each having a separate collimator .",
    "each collimator can be alternatively rocked on- and off - source to monitor the background .",

    "good data were selected from intervals when the elevation angle above the earth s limb was @xmath11@xmath14 for lecs and mecs , @xmath11@xmath15 for the hpgspc and @xmath11@xmath16 for the pds and when the instrument configurations were nominal , using the saxdas 1.3.0 data analysis package .",
    "the standard collimator dwell time of 96  s for each on- and off - source position was used , together with rocking angles of 180and 210  for the hpgspc and pds , respectively .",
    "the exposures in the lecs , mecs , hpgspc , and pds instruments are 16  ks , 34  ks , 17  ks , and 16  ks , respectively .",
    "lecs and mecs data were extracted centered on the position of  using radii of 8  and 4 .",
    "background subtraction in the imaging instruments was performed using standard files scaled appropriately to match the background level in the image , this being required because of the location of the source in the galactic plane , but is not critical for such a bright source .",
    "background subtraction in the non - imaging instruments was carried out using data from the offset intervals .",
    "figure 1 shows the background - subtracted mecs lightcurves of  with a binning of 32  s in two energy bands : 1.85.0 kev and 5.010.0 kev .",
    "observation of dipping is difficult in this source with a long orbital period if the total observation time is to be kept within limits . in this case",
    "the observation was carried out on the basis of a dipping ephemeris we obtained from the _ rxte _ asm , aiming for the dipping to occur at the centre of the observation . dipping was detected as seen in fig .",
    "1 , lasting between 3.6 and 8.4 ks with parts being missed in data gaps .",
    "the total count rate was @xmath011 count s@xmath6 .",
    "data in the high energy band reveal little flaring which was clearly seen in the _ exosat _ me as increases in count rate above 5 kev lasting several thousand seconds ( cbc95 ) , except for an increase in count rate of 20% at @xmath032 ks lasting 1.4 ks .",
    "we detected little effect in the spectral fitting that might be due to flaring .",
    "an expanded view of the dipping in the band 1.810 kev is shown in fig .  2 revealing strong variability on timescales of @xmath032 s proving `` blobbiness '' in the absorber .",
    "dips are not strongly evident in the hpgspc and pds lightcurves due to the comparatively reduced signal - to - noise ratio in these instruments and the energy dependence of the dipping",
    ".    it can be seen from fig .  1 having 32 s binning that dipping is not 100% deep in either energy band unlike , for example , xb1916 - 053 in which dipping often reaches 100% depth at all energies below 10 kev ( church et al .",
    "however , because of the fast dip ingress and egress times , 32 s binning is not short enough to reveal the true depth .",
    "tests showed that 8 s binning was adequately short , in which case the depth of deepest dipping was @xmath17% and @xmath18%    = 80 mm    in the bands 1.85.0 kev and 5.010.0 kev respectively . in fig .",
    "3 we show the results of determining the depth of dipping in the energy bands 2.53.5 kev , 3.54.5 kev , 4.55.5 kev , 5.56.5 kev and 6.57.5 kev from mecs data with 8 s binning .",
    "results are shown for data extracted in the standard radius of 4 and also for extraction radii of 2  and 15@xmath19 . for 15  extraction , it was necessary to subtract background to avoid errors in the depth .",
    "it was not possible to obtain results outside the overall band of 2.57.5 kev because of poor statistics .",
    "although there is no dramatic change in depth with energy ,    = 80 mm    there is evidence for the depth increasing at low energies , particularly for 2  extraction with 90% deep dipping at 2.53.5 kev .",
    "there is also evidence that dipping was deeper with 2extraction , but no evidence for differences between 4  and 15  extraction .",
    "thus dipping is @xmath0 80% deep over much of the 110 kev band , but is not actually proven to be 100% at any energy .",
    "there can be two reasons for this .",
    "because the galactic column density in  appears to be high , dust scattering is expected to be important and below 5 kev this can result in a non - zero intensity level in deepest dipping . above @xmath05 kev , dust scattering will not be important , and non - zero dip intensity can be due to incomplete absorption of one emission component .",
    "the increase in depth of dipping in 2extraction is consistent with a decreased amount of dust - scattered halo .",
    "the column density of x1624 - 490 from spectral fitting is high and so we have investigated possible effects of dust scattering .",
    "this is discussed in detail in sect",
    "= 80 mm      we can not carry out folding analysis of the present x - ray light curve to determine the orbital period ; however , we have examined the _ rxte _",
    "asm data on this source to determine the period more accurately which previously was only poorly known at 21@xmath92 hr ( watson et al .",
    "data were used between 1996 , feb .",
    "20 and 2000 , jan .",
    "18 and a period search carried out using standard ( xronos ) power spectrum software spanning the period range 2.5  @xmath20 hr .",
    "peaks were seen with high significance corresponding to periods of 20.87@xmath21 hr and 10.438@xmath22 hr , the significance of each of these peaks corresponding to a probability @xmath23 99.8% of being real .",
    "32 days of data folded on the period of 20.87 hr are shown in fig .",
    "4 , in which dipping is clearly seen to repeat at 20.87 hr with interdipping also seen between the main dips .",
    "this is the first detection of interdipping in this source . in the four years of asm data",
    "analysed , the depth of dipping investigated in 32 day sections of data varies , and in particular , the depth of interdipping varies from being as deep as the main dipping to being undetectable .",
    "there is some evidence that this pattern repeats on a timescale of @xmath070 days , but this can not yet be identified definitely as a new periodicity in the system .",
    "the 10.438 hr periodicity can not be the orbital period for several reasons : firstly this periodicity is at times not present in the asm data when the 20.87 hr periodicity is present .",
    "additionally , fig .",
    "4 shows dipping at 10 hr from the main dips is weak , entirely consistent with interdipping .",
    "if the orbital period were 10.438 hr , then a strong peak at 21 hr would not be seen in the power spectrum .",
    "finally , the _ exosat _ me lightcurve ( jones & watson 1989 ; church & bauciska - church 1995 ) allows the possibility of a 10-hr orbital period to be almost certainly rejected .",
    "although the column density of x1624 - 490 is high ( @xmath24 atom @xmath13 in the present work ) , implying that dust scattering effects will be important , radio measurements have indicated a lower value of @xmath25 atom @xmath13 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; stark et al .",
    "1992 ) ( although these measurements may underestimate @xmath26 when this is high ) , so that there is a possibility that the high value of @xmath26 is due to absorption intrinsic to the source . to investigate dust scattering ,",
    "we have carried out modelling of the radial intensity distribution .",
    "this was done using mecs data since spectral evolution during dipping was investigated primarily with mecs .",
    "the modelling was based on the technique used by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ; hereafter ps95 ) in their investigation of 25 galactic sources ( not including x1624 - 490 ) subject to high galactic column densities using the _ rosat _ pspc . in the case of we find excesses in the radial profile above the point spread function ( psf ) of the instrument for radii greater than @xmath0100@xmath27 indicating a substantial halo contribution .",
    "software has been developed to allow fitting the radial distribution including the source contribution convolved with the psf , a dust - scattered halo calculated on the basis of rayleigh - gans scattering theory with its associated radial distribution function ( predehl & klose 1996 ; ps95 ) , plus a background contribution . as the source lies in the galactic plane , the standard background files are not applicable , and we adopted the same approach as ps95 and allowed the background to be a free parameter .",
    "a more complete treatment would also convolve the halo with the energy - dependent psf . however , we investigated the effect of this and found that the value of the optical depth to dust scattering would only be reduced by up to 20% .",
    "the point spread function of boella et al .",
    "( 1997 ) was utilised and ximage used to provide a radial distribution function of the data . from the best fit of the model to the data , the halo intensity fraction _",
    "f@xmath28 _ was derived , where _ f@xmath28 _ is defined as the fraction of the observed intensity due to the halo , and may be written in terms of the observed source intensity @xmath29 and the observed halo intensity @xmath30 as @xmath31 these procedures were tested by applying them to the bright z - track source gx17 + 2 which has been observed both with _ rosat _ and _",
    "bepposax_. firstly , we modelled the pspc data on gx17 + 2 and derived results similar to those of ps95 .",
    "next , we modelled the  mecs data on this source .",
    "in the case of gx17 + 2 only , ps95 obtained halo fractions in 7 energy bands within the overall pspc band , which has allowed us to compare mecs results with their results at an energy where the mecs and the pspc bands overlap . in the band 1.72.1 kev a good fit was obtained with a @xmath32/dof of 78/74 , and a halo intensity fraction at 1.9 kev of @xmath33% , compared with the value of 26% which    = 80 mm",
    "we obtain from fig .",
    "8 of ps95 at this energy .",
    "this good agreement gives us confidence that the modelling was correct , and that reliable values of _",
    "f@xmath28 _ can be obtained using _",
    "bepposax_. next , modelling was carried out for x1624 - 490 .",
    "initially the mecs data were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per radial bin , then further grouping was applied with radial bins grouped together in pairs to reduce fluctuations .",
    "systematic errors of 10% were added between 10100  where the psf is uncertain by about this amount , and 2% between 100 - 1000  to account for uncertainties in the psf , faint , barely resolved sources in the field of view , and other effects .",
    "radial bins between 500 - 700  were ignored where a detector support structure causes an artificial reduction in the radial profile .",
    "the fitting was done in four energy bands : 2.53.5 , 3.54.5 , 4.55.5 and 5.56.5 kev .",
    "the best - fit solution is shown in fig . 5 for the lowest band 2.53.5 kev in which the halo was strongest .",
    "values of the halo fraction _ f@xmath28 _ from the best - fit models were found to be : @xmath34% , @xmath35% , @xmath36% in the three lowest energy bands . in the band",
    "5.56.5 kev , there was no evidence for any departure of the radial profile from the psf , and no improvement in the quality of fit by including a halo term in the model .",
    "we also calculated the halo fractions of the total count from these fitting results by integrating to a restricted outer radius of 4@xmath19 , the extraction radius used for mecs spectra ( sect .",
    "the fractions became : @xmath37% , @xmath38% , @xmath36% and @xmath39 2% respectively , in the four bands . when these fractions are compared with the depth of dipping in these bands ( fig .",
    "3 ) , it can be seen that the halo can not explain the fact that dipping does not reach a depth of 100% , particularly at the higher energies . as discussed in sect .",
    "3.5 , this must be due to incomplete absorption of an extended emission component . in fig .",
    "2 we compare the halo contribution to the intensity ( dashed line ) calculated from our results for the band 1.810 kev with the depth of dipping .    using this limited number of energy bands , we have compared the energy variation with theoretical expectations , and derived the optical depth to dust scattering @xmath40 , evaluated at 1 kev . the reduction in source intensity",
    "is given by @xmath41 , from which it can be shown that the halo fraction and @xmath40 are related _ via _",
    "@xmath42 , provided that the intensity scattered out of the line - of - sight is balanced by that scattered into the line - of - sight as is normally assumed ( e.g. martin 1970 ) . since the dust scattering cross - section is expected theoretically to vary as @xmath43 ( mauche & gorenstein * * 1986 ) , then the optical depth will also have this dependence , and @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the optical depth at 1 kev , normally quoted . using this relation",
    ", we have derived a value at 1 kev of @xmath40 = 2.4@xmath46 . within the errors on the individual values of _",
    "_ , the data are consistent with an @xmath43 dependence of the cross - section .",
    "the results show that dust scattering in the case of  is large . furthermore",
    ", we can compare the above value of @xmath40 with values in fig .",
    "7 of ps95 , in which @xmath40 is plotted against the x - ray column density for the 25 galactic sources in this survey , and varies between zero and @xmath01.5 .",
    "thus in x1624 - 490 , @xmath40 is much larger .",
    "the value of @xmath40 we obtain , and the value of @xmath26 from spectral fitting of @xmath47 atom @xmath13 may be compared with the linear @xmath40@xmath48 relation obtained by ps95 .",
    "this best relation : @xmath40 = @xmath49-\\,0.083}$ ] predicts in our case ( @xmath40 = 2.4 ) that @xmath26 = @xmath50 atom @xmath13 , compared with our fitting result of @xmath47 atom @xmath13 for the non - dip spectrum .",
    "the difference between these may imply a flattening of the relation at higher column density , or possibly intrinsic absorption in the source .",
    "it has been shown that a substantial dust scattering halo is observed in x - rays around x1624 - 490 , and we now consider prior to presenting spectral fitting results how spectra will be affected . in the case of non - dip spectra ,",
    "the effect is , in fact , expected to be zero ( provided all of the halo is collected ) , since radiation removed from the line - of - sight is replaced by that scattered into the line - of - sight by scattering , both effects taking place predominantly at lower energies , so that the net effect on the non - dip spectrum is zero .",
    "the consequence of this is that the observed intensities due to halo : @xmath30 and due to the source @xmath29 are equal to the source intensity that would have been observed without scattering ; i.e.    @xmath51 consequently , we did not include a dust scattering term in fitting the non - dip spectra .",
    "however , in dipping , the intensity lost by dust scattering is proportional to the dip source intensity while the intensity gained depends on the non - dip intensity because of the time delays in scattered radiation compared with unscattered .",
    "thus , in dip data there will be an additional dust scattered component .",
    "we have carried out spectral fitting of the mecs dip spectra firstly without any additional component , and then secondly adding terms to account for the effects of dust scattering both out of and into the line - of - sight .",
    "the total halo contains both blackbody and cut - off power law terms from the spectrum incident to scattering .",
    "the spectrum of non - dip emission was investigated by simultaneously fitting data from all the  nfi .",
    "non - dip mecs data were selected by choosing a narrow intensity band from 9.710.3 count s@xmath6 , also removing the dip data by time filtering .",
    "lecs , hpgspc and pds data corresponding to these mecs data were selected .",
    "spectral evolution in dipping was investigated using mecs data only since the dips are not strongly seen at higher energies and there are too few counts in the lecs to contribute meaningfully . for non - dip data ,",
    "the lecs and mecs spectra were rebinned to oversample the full width at half maximum of the energy resolution by a factor of 3 , and additionally lecs data were rebinned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin and mecs data to 40 counts per bin to allow use of the @xmath52 statistic .",
    "the lecs and mecs non - dip spectra were also more heavily grouped to a minimum of 100 counts per bin in each case , as experience has shown that more stable fitting may result . however , in this case , results obtained with the alternative groupings were in excellent agreement .",
    "lecs data were only used between 14 kev and mecs data between 1.710.0 kev where the instrument responses are well determined .",
    "the hpgspc data were rebinned using standard binnings in the bands 734  kev and pds data were grouped appropriately for this source in which the data decrease rapidly with energy .",

    ", it may be necessary to fit non - dip and dip spectra simultaneously , however in good fits were obtained by applying the non - dip solution to the dip spectra and using the progressive covering model .",
    "this model was firstly applied without any additional halo component . in this model",
    ", the emission components of the best non - dip fit are progressively covered by absorber , i.e. the extended comptonized emission is progressively covered and the point - like blackbody is rapidly removed when the envelope of the absorber overlaps the blackbody .",
    "the model flux may be written : @xmath88    good fits were obtained for all levels of dipping with this model as shown in table 2a .",
    "it can be seen however , that the covering fraction does not rise above 50% which is inconsistent with other sources in which the progressive covering fraction rises to 100% , e.g. xb1916 - 053 and xbt0748 - 676 ( church et al .",
    "1997 , 1998a , b ) .",
    "= 160 mm    next , we repeated this dip fitting with dust scattering terms added to the above best - fit models , so that @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the source dip intensity and @xmath91 is the non - dip intensity .",
    "the non - dip intensity consists simply of a blackbody plus a cut - off power law with galactic absorption , and @xmath90 is given by the equation above in which these emission components are subjected to progressive covering .",
    "the net model can be expressed in the simplified form : @xmath92 where ag represents galactic absorption , bb is the blackbody with absorption ab , cpl the cut - off power law and pcf the progressive covering fraction .",
    "thus , the dip intensity is reduced by the cumulative effect of dust scattering and photoelectric absorption at every level of dipping , whereas the intensity scattered towards the observer is constant depending only on the non - dip source level .",
    "the optical depth was set to the best value of 2.4 obtained from the radial fitting , and the energy dependence of @xmath40 set to @xmath43 .",
    "good fits were obtained to the non - dip and dip mecs spectra and the results are shown in table 2b and fig . 7 .",
    "although there is no significant improvement in @xmath93/dof compared with the model without dust scattering , the results including the effects of dust scattering are clearly preferable .",
    "it can be seen from table 2b that the progressive covering factor rises to 82% in the deep dip spectrum ( 2.04.0 count s@xmath6 ) , i.e. still not reaching 100% which must be due to incomplete absorption of the emission components .    in fig .",
    "7 the fits to the non - dip and 3 levels of dipping are shown , with the evolution of the blackbody and cut - off power law components shown separately . in the top",
    "left panel the total model including all components is shown together with the total halo component itself containing blackbody and cut - off power law contributions from the incident spectrum to scattering .",
    "firstly , it can be seen that the blackbody emission ( lower right ) is rapidly absorbed when the point - source becomes covered by the absorber , and is close to zero flux in the deep dip spectrum .",
    "the cut - off power law clearly displays progressive covering in that , in each spectrum , part of the spectrum at low energies is clearly unabsorbed corresponding to the uncovered part of an extended source , i.e. the accretion disk corona .",
    "the contribution of this unabsorbed part decreases as dipping deepens . in non - dip and",
    "shallow dipping this uncovered component dominates the spectrum below 5 kev . in medium",
    "dipping it is about equal to the halo contribution ( at @xmath03 kev ) , and in deep dipping the halo is larger than the uncovered emission below about 4.5 kev .",
    "however , in addition to emission uncovered by the absorber envelope , the blobbiness of the absorber demonstrated by the fast variability in dipping will also prevent dipping reaching 100% . between the blobs , a fraction of the comptonized emission from the adc will be transmitted .",
    "these results are consistent with the results obtained from _ exosat _ by cbc95 , who found in dipping there was strong absorption of the blackbody with weaker absorption of the comptonized emission .",
    "having available a set of dip spectra in the present work , not just one dip spectrum , the existence of the unabsorbed emission is revealed and the fact that progressive covering takes place .",
    "we have shown that spectral evolution in dipping in  is well - described by progressive covering of a two - component model which assumes that x - ray emission consists of point - like blackbody emission from the neutron star plus extended comptonized emission from an adc .",
    "the 130 kev luminosity of the source is @xmath94 erg s@xmath6 , for a distance of 15@xmath95 kpc ( christian & swank 1997 ) , a substantial fraction of the eddington limit , and the source is the most luminous of the dipping lmxb .",
    "the bolometric blackbody luminosity is @xmath95 erg s@xmath6 , corresponding to a blackbody radius @xmath96 of 8.3 km . if it is assumed that the emission region is an equatorial region on the neutron star in the plane of the accretion disk ( a sphere intersected by two planes ) , the half - height of the region _",
    "h _ calculated using the expression @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the radius of the neutron star ( assumed to be 10 km ) , is 6.8@xmath99 km . thus the blackbody emission is from a large fraction of the stellar surface",
    ". the half - height _ h _ of the radiatively - supported inner disk calculated from the luminosity of the source is 6.3@xmath92.9 km , in agreement with the half - height of the emission region .",
    "these results were included in a larger sample of 14 lmxb investigated using _",
    "asca _ and ( church & bauciska - church 2000 ) , in which approximate agreement is found between _ h _ and _ h _ over more than 3 decades in either parameter .",
    "this provides strong evidence that the neutron star and not the accretion disk is the source of blackbody emission in lmxb .",
    "our spectral fitting supports the point - like nature of the blackbody emission and the extended nature of the comptonized emission .",
    "the source joins the group of other dipping sources having an unabsorbed component in dipping which are well described by this combination of emission model with a progressive covering absorption model ( church et al .",
    "1997 , 1998a , b ; bauciska - church et al .",
    "the only sources not tested with this model were x1746 - 371 and xb1254 - 690 , but it has been shown that _ asca _",
    "data on these two sources are well fitted by the model ( church et al . in preparation ) .",
    "it thus appears that _ all _ of the dipping lmxb may be explained by this combination of emission model and description of covering during dips .",
    "is complicated by the dust - scattered halo .",
    "adding halo terms to the spectral model for dip spectra showed that the covering fraction for the extended hard emission rose to @xmath082% while modelling without the halo gave a maximum fraction less than 50% .",
    "spectral modelling with halo terms also showed that in shallow and medium dipping the unabsorbed comptonized emission dominates the low energy spectrum , but in deeper dipping the halo becomes dominant at low energies . in the deepest dip spectrum ,",
    "the halo exceeds the uncovered comptonized emission below 4.5 kev .",
    "angelini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in an analysis of _ asca _ data also used the x - ray image to estimate the extent of the halo , and suggested that the halo could explain the soft excess in dip spectra .",
    "the present work shows that the halo dominates in deepest dipping , but in less deep dipping the uncovered comptonized emission of the adc is the major origin of the soft excess .",
    "we have modelled the radial intensity distribution function in several energy bands to obtain the halo fraction in these bands , and also the optical depth to dust scattering at 1 kev which was found to be @xmath40 = 2.4@xmath90.4 .",
    "this value is larger than for any of the sources studied by predehl & schmitt ( ps95 ) , and the halo has appreciable effect on the the dip spectra .",
    "it is not sensible to regard dust parameters obtained from the modelling as providing definitive information on interstellar dust , since the radial modelling does not depend sensitively on the dust model used .    dipping allows us to estimate the size of the adc from dip ingress times .",
    "the fast variability on timescales of is clearly associated with individual blobs of absorber covering the point - source blackbody and so is unrelated to the size of the adc .",
    "however , other observations of the source have consistently shown extended , relatively shallow shoulders to the deep dipping which we can identify with the extended emission region being progressively covered by the absorber .",
    "this is just detectable in fig .",
    "1 . using the _ exosat _ observation and the _ rxte _ observation of sept .",
    "1999 ( smale et al . in preparation ) , we estimate an average ingress time for this slow modulation of 12500@xmath92000 s. the dip ( shoulder ) ingress time @xmath100 is the time taken for the bulge in the outer disk to cross the diameter of the x - ray emitting adc , and is obtained via the velocity of the outer disk given by @xmath101 where _ p _ is the orbital period . using a period of 20.87 hr and a mass of the neutron star of 1.4@xmath102",
    "we derive an accretion disk radius ( frank et al .",
    "1987 ) of @xmath103 cm and thus a radius of the adc of @xmath104 cm .",
    "it is remarkable that in the case of this source , the adc extends to @xmath050% of the accretion disk radius , compared with @xmath010% in xb1916 - 053 and xb1323 - 619 ( church et al . 1998b ; bauciska - church et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , given that the luminosity is @xmath105 10 times higher in it is not surprising that the adc , probably formed by evaporation by the central source and the adc itself , extends to much larger radii .    in summary",
    ", we have completed an x - ray study of  using _ bepposax_.",
    "we have obtained an improved orbital period of @xmath106 hr and made the first discovery of interdipping .",
    "we have investigated the depth of dipping in several energy bands and carried out modelling of the radial intensity distribution to obtain the halo fraction at several energies . from these data , the optical depth to scattering was derived , and an approximate @xmath43 dependence of the optical depth confirmed .",
    "spectral fitting results for the broadband non - dip spectrum are presented , and including a halo component in spectral fitting we have shown that spectral evolution is entirely consistent with progressive covering of blackbody emission from the neutron star and extended comptonized emission from the adc ."
