    "in ref .  @xcite bogner et al .  have developed a low - momentum @xmath1 interaction @xmath0 which is constructed by a combination of renormalization group ( rg ) ideas and effective field theory approaches .",
    "starting from a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction in momentum space for the two - nucleon system , the @xmath0 is obtained by integrating out the high - momentum components of the potential . in this way",
    "a cutoff momentum @xmath2 is introduced to specify the boundary between the low- and high - momentum space .",
    "since the physical low - energy quantities such as phase shifts or the deuteron binding energy must not depend on the cutoff , the full - on - shell @xmath3-matrix has to be preserved for the relative momenta @xmath4 .",
    "this yields an exact rg flow equation for a cutoff - dependent effective potential @xmath0 , which is based on a modified lippmann - schwinger equation ( lse ) .    instead of solving the rg flow equation , which is a differential equation , with standard methods ( e.g.  runge - kutta method )",
    "directly , an iteration method is used .",
    "this iteration method , pioneered by andreozzi , lee and suzuki ( als )  @xcite , is based on a similarity transformation and its solution corresponds to solving the flow equation  @xcite.this transformation is also used for the effective interaction in the no - core shell model ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 approach was generalized to the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) interaction with strangeness @xmath6 . for hyperons with strangeness @xmath6 , two isospin states @xmath7 and @xmath8 are available . for @xmath7 ,",
    "several coupled hyperon - nucleon channels occur that require new technical developments in the iteration method as already outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite . especially , the @xmath9 transition involves a mass difference of @xmath10 and causes the failure of the known methods . in the present study we discuss these novel technical modifications in detail and investigate the convergence of the als iteration methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next sec .",
    "we summarize the als iteration method for the one - flavor channel and discuss several modifications which improve its convergence .",
    "the generalization of the als method to multi - flavor channels is presented in the following section . instead of working with a realistic hyperon - nucleon interaction",
    "we introduce a simple solvable model in order to elucidate the essential modifications of the iteration method .",
    "we end with a summary and outlook .",
    "the so - called model space ( or @xmath11-space ) is introduced in order to truncate the infinitely many degrees of freedom of a hilbert space to a finite , low - energy subspace .",
    "the projection operator @xmath11 onto the model space and its complement projection operator @xmath12 onto the excluded space are defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the dimension of the model space .",
    "the wave functions @xmath15 are eigenfunctions of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath16 , which is composed of the kinetic energy and an arbitrary one - body potential .    employing this separation of the hilbert space , the original full hamiltonian @xmath17 can then be replaced by a transformed hamiltonian @xmath18 that acts only on the low - energy model subspace . in particular , if @xmath19 is an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian @xmath17 then its projection onto the model space @xmath20 satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath21",
    "the crucial point is that the eigenvalues @xmath22 of the transformed hamiltonian are the same as those of the original hamiltonian .",
    "on the other hand , the transformation of all model states @xmath23 back into the exact states defines a non - singular wave operator @xmath24 via @xmath25 . assuming that this wave operator has an inverse , the transformed hamiltonian is related to the full hamiltonian by a similarity transformation @xmath26    there is no unique representation for the wave operator @xmath24 .",
    "different choices for @xmath24 may then give different results for the perturbative expansion of the transformed interaction .",
    "furthermore , even the same defining equation for @xmath24 can be solved by different iterative schemes . as an example one often employs the ansatz by lee and suzuki  @xcite for the wave operator    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is known as the correlation operator .",
    "the correlation operator generates the component of the wave function in the @xmath12-space and can be expanded in terms of feynmann ",
    "goldstone diagrams @xcite .",
    "one choice for the correlation operator is @xmath29 and thus we have @xmath30 .    applying the operator @xmath12 on eq .",
    "( [ eq : psimodel ] ) , one immediately obtains @xmath31 . together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) , this then leads to the so - called decoupling equation @xmath32 which is to be solved in @xmath28 by iteration . for this non - linear matrix equation",
    "no general solution method is known , nor the number of existing solutions .    in this work",
    "we will discuss and generalize the solution of the decoupling equation for arbitrary coupled channels .",
    "the construction of the solution is based on the iteration method after lee and suzuki  @xcite and andreozzi  @xcite , labeled as als iteration in the following .",
    "we start with an overview of the main ingredients of the standard als iteration .",
    "as already mentioned , this is not the only existing method which solves the decoupling equation .    defining the model space effective hamiltonian , @xmath33 and its complement @xmath12-space hamiltonian , @xmath34 an iterative solution @xmath35 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : als_dec ] ) can be obtained by @xmath36 where the @xmath37 s satisfy successively @xmath38    once a solution of these equations is known , the low - momentum effective hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath39 subtracting from @xmath40 the kinetic energy in the model space , @xmath41 , this yields the wanted low - momentum potential @xmath0 . as a remark we note , that this iterative solution @xmath42 is equivalent to the ls vertex renormalization solution ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    since @xmath43 for large @xmath44 , only a finite number of terms in the sum ( [ eq : als_sum ] ) are needed numerically in order to reach a desired precision .",
    "furthermore , this condition implies for each iteration step @xmath44 the relation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the largest @xmath11-space eigenvalue ( absolute value ) and @xmath47 the smallest @xmath12-space eigenvalue .",
    "thus , as a necessary condition , this iteration method converges to the @xmath14 eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of smallest absolute value .",
    "a slight variation of the standard als iteration consists in the subtraction of a constant multiple of the identity , @xmath48 , from the full hamiltonian @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the iteration will converge to the shifted set of @xmath14 eigenvalues which are nearest to the chosen constant @xmath49 .",
    "the choice of @xmath49 is not arbitrary .",
    "one has to make sure that the eigenvalues closest to @xmath49 are really inside the @xmath11-space . for numerical applications ,",
    "this variation can also be used to accelerate the iteration since the required shift of the eigenvalues is smaller if @xmath49 is included .",
    "furthermore , calculating the @xmath0 for the hyperon - nucleon nijmegen potential  @xcite ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) the constant shift in the iteration is useful to avoid an unphysical bound state , which is inherent in the @xmath50 isospin @xmath51 channel ( cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the important observation is so far that each of the iteration schemes converges only to a set of @xmath14 consecutive eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , which are supposed to be ordered in a nondecreasing order .",
    "andreozzi described yet another generalization of the iteration procedure that enables one to shift the eigenvalues individually by a set of different numbers instead of just one constant multiple of the identity ( cf .",
    "if one denotes by @xmath52 the @xmath53-th column of a matrix @xmath54 , the decoupling equation for this case can be written in the form @xmath55 where the @xmath14-dimensional diagonal matrix @xmath56 contains the arbitrarily chosen numbers @xmath57 .",
    "thus , for each column there is a separate decoupling equation to be solved . using the preceding iteration procedure for the @xmath53-th equation one obtains the solution @xmath58    this modified als iteration scheme will converge to the eigenvalues closest to the chosen set of numbers @xmath57 .",
    "this modification leads also to a stronger convergence condition for each iteration step @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : als_conv ] ) ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the @xmath53-th eigenvalue in the model space and @xmath61 all eigenvalues in the @xmath12-space .",
    "thus , for a fixed eigenvalue @xmath53 condition ( [ eq : mals_conv ] ) there are @xmath62 inequalities for all eigenvalues in the @xmath12-space .",
    "all iteration methods , presented so far , converge rapidly for channels with only one mass involved ( one - flavor channel ) .",
    "for coupled channels with different masses ( multi - flavor channels ) new phenomena emerge and the convergence behavior ( if any ) of the iteration methods changes dramatically as already indicated in ref .",
    "this becomes especially relevant e.g.  for the hyperon - nucleon interaction in the particle basis , where up to four particles with different masses are coupled .",
    "as already mentioned , the standard and modified als iteration methods can fail for coupled channels interactions including different masses . in this section",
    "we will assess the reasons for this failure in detail . instead of considering the realistic hyperon - nucleon interaction with different particles , we introduce a simple and solvable model which mimics all qualitative and relevant features of the realistic interaction . on the basis of this model the technical modifications of the als iteration method needed as a remedy for the coupled multi - flavor channels are discussed .    in the chosen model the failure of the standard and",
    "modified als iteration methods for coupled multi - flavor channels and its cure are seen immediately .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a coupled two - flavor channel in order to keep the discussion simple .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary coupled multi - flavor channels with different masses is straightforward .",
    "the model is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath63 which is in this case a @xmath64 matrix in flavor - channel space . for the kinetic energy of the @xmath53-th channel we use @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "all quantities in our model are dimensionless .",
    "the reduced mass is defined by @xmath68 with a fixed mass @xmath69 for each @xmath53-th channel .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath57 are adjusted in such a way that typical convergence problems of the iteration method , emerging in a realistic multi - flavor channel calculation , also appear in this model .    as a bare hermitian interaction we choose a fourier - transformed yukawa potential @xmath70 with the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "the parameters @xmath77 reflect the depths and the @xmath78 the effective ranges of the corresponding potentials .",
    "they are chosen in such a way that the diagonal potentials @xmath79 are larger than the off - diagonal ones .",
    "in the two - flavor channel , the block structure of the hamiltonian looks like @xmath80 with the relation @xmath81 .    for each flavor - channel a @xmath11-space ( @xmath12-space ) with two mesh points and a cutoff @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) is introduced .",
    "here we use only two mesh points in order to simplify our discussion of convergence . in realistic calculations we use about 64 mesh points for each channel .",
    "thus , each subblock @xmath84 becomes now a @xmath85 matrix @xmath86    in fig .",
    "[ fig : toymodelcut1 ] the kinetic energy eq .",
    "( [ eq : kine ] ) as function of the momentum @xmath87 for the @xmath53-th flavor channel is shown .",
    "our choice of the @xmath11- and @xmath12-space discretization yields four mesh points on each curve ( squares for the first channel and bullets for the second channel ) .",
    "they are chosen in such a way that two mesh points of each flavor channel are close to the @xmath11-space cutoff @xmath88 which is depicted by a vertical line in the figure .    in the following",
    "we apply the standard and modified als iteration methods , described in the previous section , to this model .",
    "the results are then compared with the exact solution of the model .",
    "it is solved by numerical diagonalization , which produces the following eight eigenvalues @xmath89 . since the hamiltonian is dominated by the kinetic energy contribution @xmath16",
    ", all eigenvalues are close to these points shown in fig .",

    "the line with squares denotes the first - flavor ( @xmath90 ) channel , the other one the second - flavor ( @xmath91 ) channel ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "we use two different quantities to monitor the convergence of the als iteration methods . as a necessary convergence condition for all iteration techniques the @xmath92 should tend to zero for @xmath93 .",
    "we therefore use the norm @xmath94 ( maximal absolute column sum norm of @xmath92 ) as function of the number of iterations @xmath44 as one convergence criterion .",
    "thus , if this norm increases , the iteration method can not converge .    at each iteration step @xmath44",
    "the approximate solution @xmath95 is plugged into the decoupling equation ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : als_dec ] ) ) @xmath96 defining in this way the quantity @xmath97 .",
    "its norm @xmath98 represents a deviation ( distance ) from the exact solution , where the decoupling equation is exactly fulfilled .",
    "this quantity should also tend to zero for @xmath99 . as a second convergence criterion we calculate the eigenvalues at each iteration step by diagonalization which is surely possible for the model and monitor their behavior as function of the number of iterations .     and of the deviation from zero @xmath97 of the decoupling equation for the model as function of the iteration number @xmath44 using the standard als iteration method with one momentum cutoff .",
    "]    we begin our analysis with the standard als iteration method as described in sec .",

    "after the first few iterations , these quantities increase with @xmath44 signaling a divergence of the method but then decrease again for a larger number of iterations .",
    "this could lead to the incorrect conclusion that the als iteration method converges anyway to the right eigenvalues .",
    "this is demonstrated in the following : the eigenvalues in the @xmath11-space are given by the eigenvalues of @xmath100 and are plotted in fig .",

    "due to our grid choice for the model we can identify the @xmath11- and @xmath12-space eigenvalues uniquely .",
    "we violate in this way the convergence condition ( [ eq : als_conv ] ) because the @xmath12-space eigenvalue near the cutoff is smaller than the corresponding @xmath11-space eigenvalue ( cf .",
    "[ fig : toymodelcut1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we expect that the standard als iteration method does not converge .",

    "the @xmath11-space eigenvalue evolves from @xmath103 to @xmath104 and the @xmath12-space one from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "this mixing between a @xmath11- and @xmath12-space eigenvalue during the decimation is typical for a divergence in the als iteration method . due to our grid choice",
    "we have only one eigenvalue mixing the other three @xmath11-space eigenvalues converge to the correct solutions .",
    "but in general an arbitrarily larger number of eigenvalues which violate condition ( [ eq : als_conv ] ) could mix .",
    "unfortunately , for realistic interactions like the hyperon - nucleon interaction it is not possible to identify and sort the proper @xmath11- and @xmath12-space eigenvalues for each @xmath53th - subblock .",
    "one has to find alternative criteria which signal an eigenvalue mixing .",
    "one alternative is the norms @xmath94 and @xmath98 . during the mixing the @xmath94 and @xmath98 rise and once the eigenvalue sorting",
    "is completed they begin to drop again .",
    "thus , a rising @xmath94 ( or @xmath98 ) and a following dropping with the iteration number @xmath44 signals a level crossing and the standard als iteration method converges to wrong results .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toymodelsalsit ] .    as already mentioned , the standard als iteration method can be modified and improved by adding a diagonal matrix @xmath107 to the decoupling equation with arbitrary chosen @xmath57 ( cf .",

    "for the model calculation it is possible to try several different anstze , which indeed prevent the mixing of the @xmath11- and @xmath12-space eigenvalues and result in stable eigenvalues .",
    "unfortunately , all these anstze can not be applied to realistic interactions . for a realistic coupled channel calculation",
    "much more mesh points have to be taken into account",
    ". then the identification of the @xmath11- and @xmath12-space eigenvalues for each flavor channel @xmath53 is not possible any longer .",
    "this is also visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : toymodelcut1 ] .",
    "one can not distinguish between the channel 2 @xmath11-space eigenvalues for small momenta @xmath87 and the channel 1 @xmath11-space eigenvalues for momenta around the cutoff @xmath88 .",
    "even an alternative identification of the appropriate eigenvalues by means of eigenvector distributions , as described e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite , fails for realistic multi - flavor channel interactions .    for our model",
    "the situation is different . by construction ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath11- and @xmath12-space are well - separated and can be assigned uniquely .",
    "one way out of this dilemma is the introduction of a so - called channel - dependent cutoff .",
    "the use of the channel - dependent cutoff will cure not only the identification problem of the eigenvalues but also has a natural physical interpretation which we will discuss in the following .",
    "we assume that the dominant contribution to the full hamiltonian comes from its kinetic energy @xmath16 and the interaction is a small perturbation . the channel - dependent cutoff is a general prescription how to define the model space for low - momentum interactions that include flavor transitions with different masses .",
    "this is for example of relevance for the hyperon - nucleon interaction in the particle basis  @xcite .",
    "the idea of the channel - dependent cutoff is to truncate the kinetic energy of each channel to the same energy @xmath109 .",

    "the line with the squares denotes the first - flavor channel , the other one the second - flavor channel . ]    in principle there are two possibilities how to construct the momentum cutoffs .",
    "one possibility is to fix the value of the kinetic energy @xmath109 and then to calculate the corresponding momentum cutoffs @xmath110 .",
    "but the following procedure is better adapted to a generalization of the @xmath0 method to multi - flavor channels . instead of fixing the kinetic energy @xmath111 @xmath112 ,",
    "one calculates its value for a given momentum cutoff of the flavor channel with the smallest mass . for our model",
    "this means to choose @xmath113 for channel 1 and calculate @xmath114 for channel 2 by requiring @xmath115 for example , choosing a momentum cutoff @xmath116 for channel 1 this results in a smaller cutoff in channel 2 @xmath117 which is denoted by the vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig : toymodelcut2 ] . due to the new momentum cutoff",
    "@xmath114 the mesh points have also changed for channel 2 .",
    "a generalization to multi - flavor channels is straightforward .    using this channel - dependent cutoff ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath11- and @xmath12-space are now clearly separated and the necessary convergence conditions ( [ eq : als_conv ] ) and ( [ eq : mals_conv ] ) are fulfilled . here , we have assumed that the potential is a perturbation and does not influence the eigenvalue sorting strongly .",
    "we have checked this assumption by a numerical calculation of the eigenvalues also in the realistic calculation .",
    "as already mentioned , note that with only one momentum cutoff for multi - flavor channels it is not possible to fulfill these convergence conditions and the als iteration methods must therefore fail .",
    "another , more physical motivation for the channel - dependent cutoff is the following : the derivation of the @xmath0 renormalization group equation is based on a lippmann - schwinger equation for the @xmath3-matrix .",
    "the propagator in the lse is inverse proportional to the energy , which is truncated by a momentum cutoff . for channels with different reduced masses",
    "this would allow for different kinetic energies .",
    "thus , it is natural to restrict the kinetic energy available in the propagator and not to restrict the momenta . for one - flavor channels this difference does not play any role .",
    "this becomes more transparent if one considers an on - shell scattering process of particles with different masses .",
    "assume the scattering of a particle of channel @xmath118 into a particle of channel @xmath119 with a relative incoming momentum around the model space cutoff , i.e.  @xmath120 and masses @xmath121 .",
    "since we consider on - shell scattering , the energy @xmath122 is fixed , say to @xmath123 .",
    "this would result in @xmath124 for the scattered particle @xmath119 , which in turn yields for the outgoing relative momentum @xmath125    since we have assumed @xmath126 this outgoing relative momentum is larger than our cutoff @xmath2 .",
    "for example ,",
    "choosing for the incoming momentum @xmath127 the outgoing momentum would be @xmath128 .",
