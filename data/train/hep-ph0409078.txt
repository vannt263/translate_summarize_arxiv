    "the @xmath0 is the first and most prominent excited state of the nucleon and the only well isolated nucleon resonance .",
    "its properties provide an important test for theoretical descriptions in the non - perturbative domain of qcd .",
    "there are two kinds of electromagnetic properties of the @xmath8 .",
    "the first one involves the @xmath9 transition , described by the magnetic dipole ( @xmath10 ) and electric quadrupole ( @xmath11 ) transition moments to be determined from pion electromagnetic production  @xcite .",
    "the other properties involve the @xmath8 itself , the magnetic dipole moment @xmath12 , the electric quadrupole moment @xmath13 , and the magnetic octupole moment of the resonance .",
    "they are difficult to measure because of the short life time of the @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) of the @xmath0 is of considerable theoretical interest . in symmetric su(6 ) quark models , the nucleon and the @xmath8 resonance are degenerate and their magnetic moments are related through @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the electric charge of the @xmath8 , and @xmath16 the proton magnetic moment .",
    "however , different theoretical models predict considerable deviations from this su(6 ) value @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 mdm has also been investigated on the lattice at rather large quark masses @xcite , and very recently the chiral extrapolation of the @xmath0 mdm , including the next - to - leading non - analytic variation with the quark mass , was also studied @xcite . at present , there still is a considerably large gap in quark mass to bridge between the state - of - the - art lattice qcd calculations and the chiral limit .",
    "therefore , it would be extremely helpful to know the resonance mdm for the physical quark mass values , through experiment .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental information on the mdms beyond the ground state baryon octet is very scarce . with the notable exception of the @xmath17 baryon",
    ", these higher nucleon resonances decay strongly , and thus have too short lifetimes to measure their mdms in the conventional way through spin precession measurements .",
    "the magnetic moment of the @xmath18 has been measured by the reaction @xmath19 @xcite . as a result of these measurements , and using different theoretical analyses , the pdg @xcite quotes the range  : @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the nuclear magneton ) , while su(6 ) symmetry results in the value @xmath22 .",
    "the large uncertainty in the extraction of the experimental value is due to large non - resonant contributions to the @xmath19 reaction because of bremsstrahlung from the charged pion ( @xmath23 ) and proton ( p ) . for the @xmath1 ,",
    "it has been proposed @xcite to determine its magnetic moment through measurement of the @xmath24 reaction .",
    "due to the small cross sections for this reaction , which is proportional to @xmath25 , a first measurement has only recently been reported by the a2/taps collaboration at mami @xcite . at present , dedicated experiments are being performed with much higher count rates by using @xmath26 detectors , such as the crystal ball detector at mami @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this next generation of dedicated experiments requires a substantial theoretical effort aimed at minimizing the model dependencies in the extraction of the @xmath7 mdm from the measurement of the @xmath6 observables .",
    "first estimates for the reaction @xmath6 , including only the @xmath8-resonant mechanism , were performed in refs .",
    "an improved calculation which contains both the @xmath8-resonant mechanism and a background of nonresonant contributions has subsequently been carried out in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of the model is an effective lagrangian description of the @xmath27 process .",
    "then an additional photon is coupled in a gauge invariant way to describe the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "the result is a tree level calculation with part of the final state interaction effects taken into account by the finite width of the @xmath8 .",
    "this model was used in the analysis of the pioneering measurement of the @xmath6 cross sections and an initial value of @xmath28 \\ , \\mu_n$ ] has been extracted in ref .  @xcite . although the tree level model of ref .",
    "@xcite gives a qualitatively good description of the data of ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed quantitative comparison requires the inclusion of rescattering effects .",
    "such rescattering effects were found to be important in the case of pion photoproduction ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . since an accurate theoretical description of the reaction",
    "@xmath6 is essential for extracting a precise value for @xmath29 , it is imperative to obtain an estimate of the effects of the final - state interaction to the best of our capability",

    "iii , we present a unitary model for the @xmath27 process with a transition potential that is derived from an effective lagrangian with born terms and vector mesons exchange in addition to the @xmath8-excitation mechanism .",
    "our model is very similar to maid  @xcite in that only the on - shell rescattering effects are included in the nonresonant multipoles .",
    "we further show a selection of our fits to various experimental data , which have been used to fix all the parameters of the strong interaction .",
    "our model for the @xmath30 reaction in the @xmath0-resonance region is described in sec .",
    "the transition potential for this reaction is given by all the tree diagrams that can be obtained from the effective lagrangian previously adopted for the @xmath31 process , with the addition of the anomaly terms generated from the @xmath32 vertex .",
    "we then proceed to estimate the final - state interaction effects by including the on - shell rescattering between pion and nucleon . in sec .",

    "in this work , we provided a unitary model for the @xmath2 reaction in the @xmath0 region .",
    "our starting point is a unitary model for the @xmath5 ( @xmath304 ) reaction based on a transition potential consisting of born diagrams , vector meson exchanges and @xmath8-resonant process .",
    "the rescattering effects are included in an on - shell ( k - matrix ) approximation . besides the vector meson coupling constants ,",
    "the only free parameters in this model are the @xmath162 electric and magnetic couplings . with this model",
    "we find a very reasonable description of both total unpolarized and helicity cross sections as well as differential cross sections and photon asymmetries for both the @xmath31 and @xmath177 processes through the @xmath0 resonance region .",
    "the model for the @xmath5 processes was then extended to describe the @xmath2 reactions .",
    "our model for these reactions is gauge invariant with respect to both initial and final photons .",
    "in particular , it is constructed such that in the limit of small outgoing photon energy , it exactly reproduces the low energy theorem which relates the @xmath2 and @xmath5 processes . for the @xmath2 reactions ,",
    "the tree level terms include born diagrams , vector meson exchanges , the @xmath201 anomaly contribution and the @xmath0 contribution .",
    "the rescattering effects are calculated in the soft - photon approximation using the previously described model for @xmath5 . in this framework , the only new parameter entering in the description of the @xmath2 process is the @xmath1 magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) . using this unitary model",
    ", we investigated several @xmath305 observables .",
    "we found good agreement for the existing experimental data of the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "in particular , the rescattering effects were found to slightly reduce the cross sections at the larger outgoing photon energies , which improved the agreement with the data .",
    "we then studied the sensitivity of the @xmath6 observables to the @xmath7 mdm .",
    "the unpolarized differential cross section displays an interference structure which reduces the sensitivity to values of @xmath271 in the range between 0 and 3 .",
    "however , the photon asymmetry for linearly polarized incident photons is strongly dependent on @xmath271 , and changes between 0.35 and 0.15 when @xmath271 is varied between 0 and 6 .",
    "the dedicated measurements of the photon asymmetry that are currently underway at mami are therefore highly promising for a more quantitative extraction of the @xmath7 mdm .",
    "the single asymmetry for circularly polarized incident photons provides a new observable for a three - body reaction such as @xmath2 if the photon is emitted out of the plane defined by the incident photon and the final pion .",
    "this asymmetry has the interesting feature that it vanishes exactly in the soft - photon limit , where the @xmath6 process effectively reduces to a two - body reaction , for which the asymmetry vanishes .",
    "since the pure bremsstrahlung contribution due to soft - photon emission from the external charged particles does not contribute , the single asymmetry for circularly polarized incident photons therefore acts as a filter to enhance the @xmath8-resonant process , and indeed our results display a strong sensitivity to the @xmath7 mdm .",
    "yet another sensitive observable with regard to the @xmath7 mdm is the helicity cross section @xmath185 . in particular , this differential cross section changes by about a factor of 2 when @xmath271 is varied between 0 and 6 . besides a prediction for the @xmath6 observables",
    ", our unitary model also provides a description of the @xmath200 reaction .",
    "however , the @xmath200 process is dominated by non - resonant processes and bremsstrahlung contributions originating from radiation off the charged pion line .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the @xmath200 process will put stringent constraints on our theoretical description of the non - resonant contributions , and can be useful in minimizing model dependencies when extracting information on the @xmath7 mdm from the @xmath6 process . to improve on the accuracy in the extraction of the @xmath7 mdm , the present framework may be extended to include the rescattering corrections at finite final photon energies . at such energies",
    "the final photon can not only be emitted from the external charged lines as in figs .",
    "[ fig : rescatter ] ( b ) and ( c ) , but also from an intermediate line . a particularly important contribution in the @xmath8-region",
    "is expected to come from the @xmath306 self - energy contribution where the photon is emitted from the light pion in the loop .",
    "the ward identity then requires the energy dependence of this vertex correction be consistent with the energy dependence of the @xmath8 self energy .",
    "such a calculation , which will provide an imaginary part to the @xmath210 vertex , is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , it can be worked out in the future @xcite as an input for the present framework in order to extend its range of applicability .",
    "the upcoming dedicated measurements of the @xmath2 reaction will certainly trigger new theoretical efforts with the aim to further minimize the model dependencies in the extraction of the @xmath7 mdm .",
