    "however , in each of the separate phases , it takes a characteristic number @xmath60 of renormalization - group transformations , namely a length scale of @xmath72 , to reach the dominance of one chiral interaction .",
    "therefore , these chiral phases are distinct .",
    "after the dominance of one chiral interaction , the renormalization - group trajectory follows the periodic sequence @xmath73 resulting from matching @xmath0 and @xmath34 .",
    "by contrast , the asymptotic flow in the spin - glass phase is to a strong - coupling fixed distribution @xmath50 . since",
    ", at each locality , the largest interaction in @xmath74 is set to zero and the four other interactions are thus made negative , by subtracting the same constant from all five interactions without affecting the physics , the quenched probability distribution @xmath50 , a function of five variables , is actually composed of five functions @xmath55 of four variables , each such function corresponding to one of the interactions being zero and the other four , arguments of the function , being negative .",

    "the projections of @xmath54 onto two of its four arguments are shown in each panel of this figure .",
    "the other four @xmath55 have the same fixed distribution .",

    "5 gives the asymptotic chaotic renormalization - group trajectories of the spin - glass phase and of the phase boundary between the spin - glass and disordered phases .",
    "the five interactions @xmath75 at a given location @xmath37 , under consecutive renormalization - group transformations , are shown .",
    "chaos is measured by the lyapunov exponent @xcite , which we here generalize , by the matrix form , to our multi - interaction case : @xmath76 where the function @xmath77 gives the largest eigenvalue of its matrix argument @xmath78 and the vector @xmath79 is @xmath80 with @xmath53 , at step @xmath81 of the renormalization - group trajectory .",
    "the product in eq .",
    "( 8) is to be taken within the asymptotic chaotic band , which is renormalization - group stable or unstable for the spin - glass phase or its boundary , respectively .",
    "thus , we throw out the first 100 renormalization - group iterations to eliminate the transient points outside of , but leading to the chaotic band . subsequently , typically using 1,000 renormalization - group iterations in the product in eq .",
    "( 8) assures the convergence of the lyapunov exponent value @xmath82 .",
    "spin - glass chaos occurs for @xmath83 @xcite and the more positive @xmath82 , the stronger is chaos , as seen for example in the progressions in figs . 6 and 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the spin - glass phase of the currently studied system , the lyapunov exponent is @xmath58 and the average interaction diverges as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the number of renormalization - group iterations and @xmath61 is the runaway exponent . at the phase boundary between the spin - glass and disordered phases ,",
    "the lyapunov exponent is @xmath62 and the average non - zero interaction remains fixed at @xmath84 . as indicated by the lyapunov exponents , chaos is stronger inside the spin - glass phase than at its phase boundary .",
    "it is thus seen that chirality and chiral quenched randomness provides , in a simple model , remarkably rich phase transition phenomena .",

    "<S> the chiral clock spin - glass model with @xmath0 states , with both competing ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic and left - right chiral frustrations , is studied in @xmath1 spatial dimensions by renormalization - group theory . </S>",

    "<S> the system has a ferromagnetic phase , a multitude of different chiral phases , a chiral spin - glass phase , and a critical ( algebraically ) ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic and chiral phases accumulate at the disordered phase boundary and form a spectrum of devil s staircases , where different ordered phases characteristically intercede at all scales of phase - diagram space . </S>",
    "<S> shallow and deep reentrances of the disordered phase , bordered by fragments of regular and temperature - inverted devil s staircases , are seen . </S>",
