    "granular matter and glasses share a number of properties  such as off - equilibrium dynamics , aging , and hysteresis  and analogies between them have long @xcite been pointed out .",
    "however it was not until the seminal experiments of the chicago group @xcite on granular compaction were carried out that serious attempts were made to quantify such analogies .",
    "the experiments focus on the compaction behaviour of a large number of grains subject to repeated tapping and have become a paradigm for subsequent theoretical models .",
    "these models fall into roughly two classes : lattice - based models @xcite in a finite - dimensional space ( which in general do not admit analytic solutions ) or mean field models @xcite ( where each site interacts with a large number of other sites ) . in this paper",
    "we discuss how models on random graphs may be used to describe aspects of the behaviour of granular matter which depend on the _ finite _ connectivity of the ( disordered ) grains , while still remaining analytically accessible .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : we discuss and motivate a simple spin - model defined on a random graph introduced as a model of granular compaction in @xcite . in this model",
    "the random close packing density reached asymptotically after a large number of taps is identified with a dynamic phase transition .",
    "secondly , we discuss an athermal dynamics @xcite , consisting of alternating periods of thermal dynamics at a certain temperature and quenches at zero temperature which take the system to a metastable state .    next , the compaction curve of the tapping process will be discussed and its two main features , the single particle relaxation threshold and the random close packing density ( dynamical transition ) , will be analyzed in detail .",
    "we then present results of numerical simulations of tapping - amplitude cycling with a discussion of hysteresis and the asymptotic state of the model .",
    "finally we investigate the statistical mechanics of the blocked configurations and discuss the validity of the so - called edwards measure @xcite .",
    "a random graph @xcite consists of a set of nodes and bonds , with the bonds connecting each node at random to a finite number of others , thus from the point of view of connectivity appearing like a finite - dimensional structure .",
    "each bond may link up two sites ( a graph ) or more ( a so - called hypergraph ) .",
    "formally , a random graph of @xmath0 nodes and average connectivity @xmath1 is constructed by considering all @xmath2 possible bonds between the nodes and placing a bond on each of them with probability @xmath3 . in other words",
    "the connectivity matrix @xmath4 is sparse and has entries @xmath5 ( bond present ) and @xmath6 ( no bond ) , which are independent and identically distributed variables with probability @xmath3 and @xmath7 respectively . the resulting distribution of local connectivities is poissonian with mean and variance @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting structure is _ locally _ tree - like but has loops of length of order @xmath8 .",
    "although there is no geometric concept of distance ( in a finite dimensional space ) , a chemical distance may be defined by determining the minimum number of steps it takes to go from one given point to another .    in a similar fashion ,",
    "graphs  strictly speaking hypergraphs  with plaquettes connecting @xmath9 or more nodes each may be constructed .",
    "choosing @xmath10 randomly with probability @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) results in a random 3-hypergraph , where the number of plaquettes connected to a site is distributed with a poisson distribution of average @xmath1 .",
    "an illustration of part of such a graph is shown in figure [ 3graph ] .",
    "= .25    spin models on random graphs have been investigated for almost 20 years @xcite since they may be considered as being halfway between infinite - connectivity models and finite - dimensional models , having to a certain extent the analytic accessibility of the former within the framework of mean - field theory , yet the finite connectivity of the latter .",
    "interest in these models has intensified lately since they occur in the context of random combinatorial optimization problems @xcite and inroads have been made towards their analytic treatment beyond replica - symmetry @xcite .    in the context of modelling the compaction of granular matter , random graphs are the simplest structures with a finite number of neighbours .",
    "the finite connectivity is a key property , which goes beyond the simple fact that the grains in a granulate are in contact with a finite number of neighbouring grains .",
    "for instance kinetic constraints , which are a prominent feature in many models of granular behaviour @xcite can only be meaningfully defined in models with a finite connectivity .",
    "furthermore cascades found experimentally during the compaction process may be explained by interactions between a finite number of neighbouring sites , where one local rearrangement sets off another one in its neighbourhood and so on @xcite .",
    "another reason for the use of random graphs lies in the disordered structure of granular matter even at high densities .",
    "a random graph is the simplest object where a neighbourhood of each site may be defined , but has no global symmetries like a regular lattice .",
    "additionally , the locally fluctuating connectivity may be thought of as modelling the range of coordination numbers of the grains @xcite .",
    "in the following we consider a 3-spin hamiltonian on a random hypergraph where @xmath0 binary spins @xmath13 interact in triplets @xmath14 where the variable @xmath15 with @xmath16 denotes the presence of a plaquette connecting sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes its absence .",
    "this hamiltonian has recently been studied on a random graph in the context of satisfiability problems in combinatorial optimization @xcite , on a random graph of fixed connectivity @xcite , and on a 2d triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "it has a trivial ground state where all spins point up and all plaquettes are in the configuration @xmath19 giving a contribution of @xmath20 to the energy . yet , _ locally _ , plaquettes of the type @xmath21 ( satisfied plaquettes ) also give the same contribution .",
    "this results in a competition between local and global satisfaction of the plaquettes : locally any of the satisfied plaquettes are equivalent ( thus favouring a paramagnetic state ) , yet globally a ferromagnetic state may be favoured , since there are few configurations satisfying all plaquettes , where @xmath22 configurations @xmath23 occur in equal proportions . for @xmath24 @xcite ,",
    "ground states have a positive magnetisation , which may be interpreted as the onset long - range order and of a possibly crystalline @xcite state of the granular medium .",
    "= .25    however _ two _ spin flips are required to take a given plaquette from one satisfied configuration to another .",
    "thus an energy barrier has to be crossed in any intermediate step between two satisfied configurations as illustrated in figure [ figcube ] . in the context of granular matter",
    "this mechanism aims to model the situation where compaction follows a temporary dilation ; for example , a grain could form an unstable ( loose ) bridge with other grains before it collapses into an available void beneath the latter .",
    "this mechanism , by which an energy barrier has to be crossed in going from one metastable state to another , has recently been argued to be an important ingredient in models of granular compaction @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature of the model responsible for the slow dynamics , however , is the degeneracy of the four configurations of plaquettes with @xmath25 resulting in competition between satisfying plaquettes _ locally _ and _ globally_. in the former case , all states with even parity may be used , resulting in a large entropy and in the latter , only the @xmath19 state may be used .",
    "a dynamics based on local quantities will thus _ fail _ to find the magnetised configurations of low energy .",
    "this mechanism has a suggestive analogy in the concept of geometrical frustration of granular matter , if we think of plaquettes as granular clusters .",
    "when grains are shaken , they rearrange locally , but locally dense configurations can be mutually incompatible .",
    "voids may appear between densely packed clusters due to mutually incompatible grain orientations between neighbouring clusters .",
    "the process of compaction in granular media consists of a competition between the compaction of _ local _ clusters and the minimisation of voids _",
    "globally_.      there have been many kinds of dynamical schemes to model the behaviour of granular media under tapping .",
    "a recurring theme is the alternation of periods of randomly perturbing the system and periods in which the system is allowed to settle into a mechanically stable state .",
    "these have included nonsequential monte carlo reorganisation schemes @xcite , the ratio of upward to downward mobility of particles on a lattice @xcite , or variable rates of absorption and desorption @xcite .    in the same spirit ,",
    "we treat each tap as consisting of two phases .",
    "first , during the _ dilation _ phase , particles are accelerated and are relatively free to move with respect to each other for a time . in the second phase ,",
    "the _ quench _ phase , particles relax until a mechanically stable configuration is reached .    as initial condition",
    "we use a configuration obtained by quenching the system from a configuration where the spins are chosen independently to be @xmath26 with equal probabilities . to mimic the action of tapping ,",
    "we choose the following dynamics of the spins . the dilation phase is modelled by a single sequential monte - carlo - sweep of the system at a dimensionless temperature @xmath27 : a site @xmath28 is chosen at random and flipped with probability @xmath5 if its spin @xmath29 is antiparallel to its local field @xmath30 , with probability @xmath31 if it is not , and with probability @xmath32 if @xmath33 . this procedure is repeated @xmath0 times .",
    "sites with a large absolute value of the local field @xmath30 thus have a low probability of flipping into the direction against the field .",
    "such spins may be thought of as being highly constrained by their neighbours .",
    "this differs somewhat from the dilation - phase model in @xcite , where a certain fraction of spins is flipped regardless of the value of their local field .",
    "we claim that our present dynamics is rather more realistic in the context of vibrated granular media ; if grains are densely packed ( strongly bonded to their neighbours ) , they are less likely to be displaced during the dilation phase of vibration than grains which are loosely packed .",
    "the _ quench _ phase is modelled by a quench of the system at @xmath34 , which lasts until the system has reached a blocked configuration , i.e. each site @xmath28 has @xmath35 or @xmath33 .",
    "thus at the end of each tap the system will be in a blocked configuration .",
    "this dynamics may be thought of as a series of quenches where the initial condition for each quench is obtained by perturbing the result of the previous quench .",
    "it is a simplified version , suitable for spin models , of the tapping dynamics used in cooperative monte carlo simulations of sphere shaking @xcite . in the context of combinatorial optimization it corresponds to the class of random - restart algorithms ( e.g. @xcite ) , which include some of the most efficient algorithms for the solution of optimization problems .",
    "an example of a single run of the system is shown in figure [ compact ] .",
    "we can identify three regimes of the dynamics : first , a very fast increase of the density up to a density @xmath36 during the first tap , then a slow compaction regime which takes the density up to @xmath37 , and finally an asymptotic regime .    in the first regime ,",
    "all sites orient their spins in parallel with the local field acting on that site .",
    "this quench corresponds to a _",
    "fast _ dynamics whereby _ single _ particles _ locally _ find the orientation maximizing the density leading to the density of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "in @xcite this density was termed the _ single - particle relaxation threshold _ ( sprt ) .",
    "= .5    the second phase of the dynamics consists of removing some of the remaining frustrated plaquettes and gives a logarithmically slow compaction @xcite leading from a density @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting compaction curve may be fitted to the well - known logarithmic law @xcite @xmath38 which may also be written in the simple form @xmath39 implying that the dynamics becomes slow ( logarithmic ) as soon as the density reaches @xmath36 . in this regime , most spins have a nonzero local field acting on them , which keeps them fixed in a certain direction @xcite .",
    "the corresponding grains are firmly held in place by their neighbours . however , during the dilation phase some of them have their orientation altered , altering the local fields acting on their neighbouring grains by a finite amount , which could cause them to flip in turn .",
    "the dynamics of the grains with zero local field may alter the local field of their neighbours , and induce a previously blocked grain to flip . in this way a _",
    "@xcite of flips may ensue .",
    "with increasing density , free - energy barriers rise up causing the dynamics to slow down according to ( [ loglaw ] ) .",
    "the point where the height of these barriers scales with the system size marks a _ breaking of the ergodicity of the dynamics _ , a break - up of the phase - space into a large number ( scaling exponentially with the system size ) of disconnected clusters , and a saturation of the compaction curve . for small driving amplitudes ,",
    "we thus identify the asymptotic density ( random close packing ) with a _ dynamical phase transition _ @xcite .",
    "in the following we will examine in detail the sprt and the dynamical transition .",
    "the first tap is modelled as a quench at zero temperature . at the end of this , each site is connected to more ( or as many ) unfrustrated plaquettes than frustrated ones .",
    "the spin of any site where this is not the case would flip under the zero - temperature dynamics , turning frustrated plaquettes into unfrustrated ones .",
    "the question of the density reached after a quench from random starting conditions is highly non - trivial , since its resolution involves the basins of attraction of the zero - temperature dynamics .",
    "the problem may be illustrated by considering a single site @xmath28 connected to @xmath40 other sites and subject to the local field @xmath41 .",
    "for random initial conditions , the values of @xmath42 are binomially distributed with a probability of @xmath43 if @xmath44 is even and zero if it is odd . if @xmath45 zero - temperature dynamics will flip this spin , turn @xmath46 to @xmath47 and turn @xmath48 satisfied ( dissatisfied ) plaquettes connected to it into dissatisfied ( satisfied ) ones .",
    "this will cause the @xmath49 of @xmath50 neighbouring sites to decrease ( increase ) by 2 .",
    "this dynamics stops when all sites have @xmath51 , giving @xmath52 .",
    "this process is made complicated by correlations between the local fields of neighbouring sites . neglecting these correlations we arrive at a simple population model of @xmath0 units , each with a poisson distributed value of @xmath53 and a value of @xmath46 distributed according to the initial binomial distribution . at each step a randomly chosen element with negative @xmath46 has its @xmath46 inverted , and @xmath50 randomly chosen elements have their values of @xmath54 decreased ( increased ) by 2 until @xmath55 .",
    "this simplistic model works surprisingly well at low values of the connectivity @xmath1 ( with an error of about @xmath56 up to @xmath57 ) , but obviously fails completely at large values of @xmath1 or in fully connected models .    in principle",
    "the differential equations describing the population dynamics could be solved analytically . here",
    "we simply report the results for running the population dynamics numerically with @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "we obtain @xmath60 which is shown as a dotted line in figure [ compact ] .",
    "note that this density is found to be much higher than that of a typical blocked configuration with @xmath55 which is found to be @xmath61 ( see section [ blockedconfiguration ] and also the discussion in @xcite ) . despite the fact that these blocked configurations are exponentially dominant , the total basin of attraction of the configurations at @xmath36 dominates the space of random initial conditions .",
    "another significant feature of this regime is that a fraction of spins is left with local fields exactly equal to zero , which thus keep changing orientation @xcite .",
    "these spins may be compared to so - called rattlers , @xcite , i.e. grains which change their orientation _ within _ well - defined clusters @xcite .",
    "these will be used as a tool to probe the statistics of blocked configurations in section [ blockedconfiguration ] .    to conclude this section",
    ", the sprt density appears as the density which is reached dynamically by putting each particle into its _ locally _ optimal configuration , as has also been found in lattice - based models @xcite and simulations of sphere packings @xcite , which show both fast and slow dynamics .",
    "the dynamical transition is marked by the appearance of an exponential number of valleys in the free - energy landscape and thus a breaking of ergodicity @xcite . in the event that the dynamics is thermal ,",
    "equilibration times diverge at the temperature corresponding to the dynamic transition . cooling the system down gradually from high temperatures",
    "will also result in the system falling out of equilibrium at the dynamical transition temperature .",
    "furthermore , the energy will get stuck at the energy at which the transition occurs .",
    "since this phenomenon is the result of the drastic change in the geometry of phase space , it is not surprising that we also find it in the athermal dynamics defined in section [ modellingtapping ] .",
    "either gradually decreasing the tapping amplitude @xmath27 or tapping at a low amplitude for a long time will get the system to approach the density ( energy ) at which the dynamical transition occurs .",
    "we thus identify the random close packing limit in this model with a dynamical phase transition .",
    "to support this picture , we give a simple approximation for the density @xmath37 at which the dynamical transition occurs . using the replica - trick @xmath62 @xcite and standard manipulations , we obtain for the average of the @xmath63-th power of the partition - function of the hamiltonian ( [ hdef ] ) averaged over the ensemble of random graphs @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an order parameter function defined on the domain of the @xmath66 vectors @xmath67 .",
    "the general replica - symmetric ansatz is incorporated in @xmath68 .",
    "taking @xmath69 gives the paramagnetic solution , valid in the high - temperature phase , resulting in a free energy @xmath70 @xmath71 to determine the temperature at which the dynamics transition occurs , a replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) ansatz is required @xcite .",

    "the dynamical transition occurs at a temperature @xcite where @xmath78 evaluated at @xmath79 develops a minimum at finite @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding density is marked with a horizontal line in figure [ compact ] and agrees well with the asymptotic density reached by the tapping dynamics .",
    "however this asympotitic density is not the highest density , that can be reached without putting the system into an ordered configuration , however it is the highest such density which is reached by a local dynamics .",
    "the tapping dynamics introduced in section [ modellingtapping ] may be used to increase and decrease the tapping amplitude successively .",
    "this _ amplitude cycling _ is an important protocol in real and numerical experiments .",
    "the ramp rate @xcite is defined as the ratio @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of taps spent at each amplitude , which is changed with an increment of @xmath82 after each series of taps .",
    "the results of increasing @xmath27 continuously from @xmath6 to @xmath83 and back again at two rates @xmath84 and @xmath85 per tap is shown in figure [ figcycle1 ] ; here , clearly @xmath86 , and the ramp rate is in fact just @xmath82 . as expected , both at high and at low cycling rates , the density first reaches the sprt @xmath36 , then increases with increasing amplitude and time , until it decreases again at large values of @xmath27 .",
    "as the amplitude is decreased , the system reaches @xmath87 .",
    "the part of the curve where @xmath27 is increased for the first time is conventionally @xcite called the _",
    "irreversible branch _ , while the _ reversible branch _ refers to the section where @xmath27 is subsequently decreased and then increased again .",
    "however the similarity of this simple picture with experimental results of @xcite is deceptive . from section [ dyntrans ] we know that at fixed , finite but low amplitudes the model eventually reaches @xmath87 . as a result , the branches of increasing amplitude at low @xmath27 do not coincide for high and low rates of change of the amplitude . at low rates of change the density as a function of @xmath27 is higher than at high rates of change .",
    "this irreversibility of the so - called reversible branch is thus due to the system not reaching a steady - state at each value of the amplitude .",
    "this behaviour has also been observed in other models @xcite .",
    "= .5    in fact , in the limit of infinitely slow increments of @xmath27 , the irreversible branch would disappear , and @xmath88 would become a single - valued function of @xmath27 .",
    "this would be in direct contradiction to the experimental results of @xcite , where at low amplitudes the steady - state density _ can not _ be reached with a sufficiently large number of taps , at least within experimentally realisable times .",
    "this phenomenon may be thought of as follows : some particles in a granular assembly are so strongly constrained that they will never ( at least within experimentally realisable times ) be moved by taps of a sufficiently low amplitude",
    ". in the dynamics of our model described thus far , however , sites with a high local field may be flipped at any finite value of @xmath27 with a correspondingly _ small but finite _ probability , leading the system eventually to @xmath87 .    to model this effect ,",
    "it is not sufficient to prevent spins with a large value of the local magnetic field from being flipped since the dynamics of their neighbours will eventually lead to a reduction of their field , freeing the previously constrained spins .",
    "instead , we assign to each site @xmath28 a real number @xmath89 between zero and one , and during the dilation phase of the dynamics , we only flip spins at sites @xmath28 with @xmath90 . during the quench phase",
    "any spin may be flipped .    in the language of grains ,",
    "@xmath89 represents the strength with which a grain is constrained by its neighbours ; sites @xmath28 such that @xmath91 will be permanently resistant to being displaced at an intensity of vibration @xmath27 . in a real system , these thresholds would be determined by details of the inter - grain force network .",
    "the aim of this modification is to check if the scenario of section [ dyntrans ] survives , since in principle it is possible that a new and lower value of @xmath37 emerges after the amplitude has been increased and decreased : at high shaking amplitudes frustrated plaquettes ( clusters ) might be generated , which can not be eliminated at low values of the amplitude , similar to the scenario proposed in @xcite .",
    "= .5    figure [ figcycle2 ] , where the cycling of figure [ figcycle1 ] is repeated with the constraining of spins , shows that @xmath37 remains unaltered .",
    "in fact , figures [ figcycle1 ] and [ figcycle2 ] look remarkably similar .",
    "the effect of constraining some spins at low values of @xmath27 emerges when the ramp rate is decreased substantially , in particular by allowing the spins to equilibrate at each amplitude by choosing a large @xmath81 . in figure [ asympt ]",
    "we thus increase the shaking amplitude @xmath27 from @xmath92 to @xmath83 in steps of @xmath92 with @xmath93 taps waited at each amplitude step .",
    "this makes sure that a steady - state of the density has been reached at each amplitude .",
    "we find , in this case , that at low amplitudes the immobile spins cause the system to reach a steady - state with a density lower than @xmath37 . despite the fact that in @xcite , very low ramp rates were used , with large waiting times @xmath81 at each tap ,",
    "this behaviour was not observed ; rather the results of all these simulations implied that the asymptotic density @xmath37 would always be approached in the limit of sufficiently low ramp rates .",
    "one may view the ( random ) configuration of the immobile spins at each value of @xmath27 as an additional quenched disorder and their effect on neighbouring mobile spins , as a random local field .",
    "presumably the dynamics in the sub - space of phase - space corresponding to the mobile spins ( with fixed local fields due to the immobile spins ) undergoes a dynamic transition as the corresponding steady - state density is reached .",
    "the result that @xmath37 is reached decreasing @xmath27 from above even though a finite fraction of spins has been rendered immobile at low temperatures , is quite remarkable : it is a testament to the paramagnetic nature of the model at densities below @xmath37 . in a glassy state",
    ", one would expect the configurations of spins reached at high values of @xmath27 and subsequently frozen to alter the behaviour of the system at lower values of @xmath27 .",
    "the paramagnetic system manages very well to adapt the _ mobile spins _ to the configuration of the immobile ones produced at higher values of @xmath27 - not however to random configurations of the _ immobile spins _ , which are responsible for the irreversible branch .",
    "these results demonstrate a rather fundamental difference between thermal excitations in glassy systems and intensities of mechanical vibration in granular media . in the glassy phase of a system",
    ", one would expect the configurations of spins reached at high values of temperature and subsequently frozen , to alter the behaviour of the system at lower values of temperature . in granular media , however , it is important to let the system _ reach the asymptotic density _ at each value of the shaking intensity@xmath27 , in order even to begin to observe the hysteresis that must result when mobile grains become part of immobile clusters @xcite , generating a type of quenched disorder at least at low vibrational intensities .",
    "the difference between figs .",
    "[ figcycle2 ] and [ asympt ] clearly illustrates this .",
    "given that the experiments results @xcite were done in such a way that the system was allowed to reach the asymptotic density at each value of the tapping amplitude , our results indicate that jamming @xcite of grains caused by the force network might be responsible for the fact that the @xmath37 is not reached by tapping solely at low amplitudes .",
    "in this section we focus on the statistical mechanics of the blocked configurations referred to earlier , and use these results to address the question of ergodicity of the tapping dynamics . after each tap according to section [ modellingtapping ] , the system is in a blocked configuration , i.e. each site @xmath28 has @xmath94 or @xmath33 .",
    "the edwards hypothesis @xcite states that in the steady state along the reversible branch all mechanically stable configurations at a given density are equiprobable .",
    "we test this hypothesis for the tapping dynamics of section [ modellingtapping ] .",
    "we begin by calculating the average entropy of blocked configurations at a given density . in principle",
    ", we would need to average the logarithm of the number of blocked states over the ensemble of random graphs ; this so - called quenched average can be expected to be self - averaging . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the so - called annealed average and compute @xmath95 which gives an upper bound to the quenched average .",
    "the number of blocked configurations @xmath96 may be written easily as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath6 otherwise , denotes a kronecker - delta and @xmath99 denotes a discrete heaviside step function with @xmath100 and @xmath6 otherwise . after using integral representations for the kronecker - deltas and standard manipulations ,",
    "one easily obtains @xmath101 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath102 denotes the modified bessel - function of the first kind of order @xmath103 . in figure",
    "[ figsbann ] , the entropy of blocked configurations @xmath104 is shown along with the paramagnetic entropy given by ( [ sannres ] ) below , which is derived by including terms with negative @xmath105 .",
    "= .5    these expressions were evaluated for @xmath59 and the results are shown in figure [ figsbann ] . from this data , the lowest density at which blocked configurations occur ( @xmath106 )",
    "is found to be @xmath107 , and the density of a randomly chosen blocked configuration ( the maximum of @xmath104 ) is @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , one may calculate the fraction @xmath109 of connected sites with zero local magnetic field in a blocked configuration . as we will argue below",
    ", this is a useful quantity to test the edwards hypothesis .",
    "> from ( [ sbannres ] ) one obtains @xmath110 where for any given value of @xmath88 , the values of @xmath111 and of the order parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 are given by the extremisation condition in equation ( [ sbannres ] ) , and where we have subtracted a trivial term @xmath114 corresponding to the fraction of unconnected sites .",
    "analogously , the fraction of connected sites with zero local magnetic field at a given density ( without the blocking condition ) is given by @xmath115           i_h ( 4 c a b )           + i_0 ( 4 c a b )   } - e^{-c } \\ , \\ ] ] where the values of @xmath116 follow from extremizing over @xmath117 i_h ( 4 c a b )           + 2 i_0 ( 4 c a b )   \\right ) \\right]\\ ] ]    figure [ figg_rho ] shows @xmath109 and @xmath118 as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "as expected , both quantities decrease monotonically with @xmath88 .",
    "again , we also give the results of exhaustive enumerations of a system with @xmath119 , averaged over @xmath120 samples in order to test the validity of the annealed approximation .",
    "the annealed curve for blocked states and the numerical results show significant differences . for this reason",
    ", we also give the result of the much more involved replica - calculation of the quenched average @xcite as the dashed line , which agrees very well with the numerical results .",
    "= .5    with these results , we may now test the edwards hypothesis for this model under the tapping dynamics of section [ modellingtapping ] .",
    "if blocked states at the asymptotic density are accessed with equal probability , a plot of the fraction of connected sites with zero local field versus the density should coincide with the results of ( [ gbann ] ) at the asymptotic density .    the value of @xmath109 is a useful quantity to test this hypothesis , since as discussed in section [ sprt ] , the fraction of spins with a given local field is intimately related to the fast quenching dynamics . also , as a one - time quantity it may be measured easily .    in figure",
    "[ figedwards_test ] , we show the results of 4 single runs at @xmath121 , plotting @xmath109 against @xmath88 .",
    "it shows clearly that at the asymptotic density , the ( quenched ) result for @xmath109 against @xmath88 and the results of the tapping dynamics agree to within numerical accuracy of the analytical result , we tentatively conclude that the edwards hypothesis is valid in this model at low tapping intensities and at the asymptotic density reached by low - intensity tapping .",
    "further results will be reported elsewhere @xcite .    during the compaction phase , however , the blocked configurations accessed dynamically have a lower value than that of the exponentially dominant blocked configurations contributing to ( [ gbann ] ) .",
    "the result that the blocked configurations accessed dynamically have a lower value of @xmath109 than the typical ones at the same value of @xmath88 , may be explained to a certain extent as follows .",
    "configurations with a large value of @xmath109 are favoured entropically , since spins with zero magnetic field may be flipped leaving the configuration blocked ( provided this does not cause the local field of their neighbours to change sign ) . in the quenching dynamics , however , there is no such mechanism ; sites with zero magnetic field are created only by spin - flips of neighbouring sites .",
    "nevertheless it is remarkable that for the three lower values of @xmath27 ( light tapping ) , where the asymptotic density is very close to @xmath87 , the three traces nearly fall onto a single line , indicating that _ also during compaction _ the blocked configurations are sampled according to a certain ensemble which depends on the density only .",
    "this occurs even though the plots of @xmath122 versus the number of taps do not coincide for these amplitudes .",
    "to conclude , we have presented a _",
    "finitely connected _ spin model of vibrated granular matter , where we have built upon earlier work @xcite .",
    "we argue that spin - models on random graphs may serve as models of granular matter , since they show no symmetries in the way a regular lattice does .",
    "they also arise as the bethe - lattice approximation to finite - dimensional models .",
    "multi - spin interactions generically arise when models of geometric frustrations are transferred to the bethe - lattice .",
    "we discuss one of the simplest models of this class , the ferromagnetic @xmath9-spin model . due to competition between satisfying the interactions globally and locally",
    "the model never reaches the ferromagnetic state .",
    "this mechanism aims to model the geometric frustration incurred by packings which arise from maximising the density locally .",
    "we also discuss the problems incurred by glassy models in the context of amplitude cycling . in order to model the effect of some grains",
    "being rendered completely immobile by large intergranular forces , we investigate the effect of constraining by hand some of the spins in the context of amplitude cycling experiments .",
    "we also test the edwards hypothesis @xcite in the context of our model , and concluded that it is valid for the tapping dynamics used .",
