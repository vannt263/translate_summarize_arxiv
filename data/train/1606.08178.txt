    "molecular crystals , including organic and inorganic , are vital in understanding the physics and chemistry of the earth and planets .",
    "they are also of considerable technological interest .",
    "low - z molecular systems are among the most abundant in the solar system , as represented by planetary gases and ices .",
    "their behaviour at high pressures is crucial in modelling the structure , dynamic , and evolution of the large planets .",
    "moreover , compression of molecular systems provides the opportunities to form new materials , possibly with novel properties , such as high - temperature superconductivity and disordered and amorphous materials .",
    "one of the simplest organic molecular solids is crystalline benzene with aromatic van der waals ( vdw ) interactions .",
    "given its simplicity , high symmetric , and rigid molecular structure , crystalline benzene has become the model structure for calculating the lattice model vibrations in molecular crystals .",
    "benzene has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally @xcite . however , the phase transitions and intermolecular interactions are still controversial .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive study of the phase transition of crystalline benzene at low pressures .",
    "early experiments by bridgman@xcite revealed that liquid benzene crystallises at 68 mpa with @xmath0 space group symmetry and closest @xmath4 intermolecular distance of 3.5 @xmath5 .",
    "this structure , also , was confirmed at zero pressure and 270 k@xcite .",
    "this phase i is also stable at lower temperatures of 218 and 138 k@xcite .",
    "since then , two experimental phase diagrams have been proposed for crystalline benzene .",
    "first , based on the phase diagram suggested by thiry and lger@xcite , liquid benzene crystallises at room temperature and pressure 700 bar within an orthorhombic structure @xmath0 , which is labeled as phase i. phase ii was suggested to exist between 1.4 and 4 gpa .",
    "phases i and ii primitive unit cells contain four benzene molecules ( z=4 ) .",
    "phase iii is stable between 4 and 11 gpa .",
    "the symmetry of phase iii is @xmath2 with two benzene molecules per monoclinic primitive unit cell ( z=2 ) .",
    "second , the phase diagram developed by ciabini _ et al._@xcite which based on it phase i is orthorhombic @xmath0 z=4 and phase ii is monoclinic @xmath2 z=2 @xcite .",
    "their results are obtained by means of infrared spectroscopy and x - ray analysis under high pressure .",
    "the @xmath2 phase is stable up to pressures 20@xmath625 gpa .",
    "this phase diagram only consists of two phases ( i and ii ) , and this same result has been reported by other experiments @xcite .",
    "et al_@xcite , have determined the crystal structures of phases i and ii at 295 k. the results of their study confirm ciabini _",
    "et al.s_ phase diagram and show that the structures of phases i and ii are @xmath0 z=4 and @xmath2 z=2 , respectively .",
    "the results also indicate the absence of other benzene phases in the pressure range up to 5 gpa .",
    "the crystalline benzene phase diagram is a challenge for first - principles theory because the energy differences are insignificant , and they are governed by vdw interactions .",
    "the energy difference between crystalline benzene and its low - energy polymorphs under pressure is less than few kj / mol .",
    "metadynamics calculations predict seven phases@xcite as phases i ( @xmath0 z=4 ) , i@xmath7 ( @xmath8 z=4 ) , ii ( @xmath1 z=4 ) , iii ( @xmath2 z=2 ) , iii@xmath7 ( @xmath9 z=4 ) , iv ( @xmath10 z=4 ) , and v ( @xmath11 z=2 ) . in their calculations",
    ", they have used numerous randomly generated metastable crystal structures as starting points for the metadynamics .",
    "a few metadynamics steps are often sufficient to obtain a more stable structure , which most of the time is similar to @xmath0 z=4 or @xmath2 z=2 .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) has also been used to compute the lattice energy of crystalline benzene@xcite .",
    "_ employed dft formalism and used perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite exchange correlation functionals to study the phase diagram of crystalline benzene up to 300 gpa@xcite .",
    "they explained the complexities observed in benzene at high pressure . in the moderate pressure regime ( p @xmath12 20 gpa ) , they found that the @xmath0 structure is stable up to 4 gpa , the @xmath1 phase is preferred in the pressure range of 4@xmath67 gpa , and the @xmath2 structure shows the lowest enthalpy at higher pressures .",
    "therefore , they labelled the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 structures as phases i , ii , and iii , respectively .",
    "the present study shows that the @xmath1 structure is unstable in the pressure range of 0@xmath610 gpa .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 and @xmath2 structures are labelled as phases i and ii , respectively .    recently",
    ", quantum chemistry methods have been applied to benzene to obtain sub - kilojoule / mole accuracy in the lattice energy for crystalline benzene @xcite .",
    "tremendous measures are necessary to obtain such accuracy . in this work",
    ", we will show that qmc is an alternative efficient approach to achieve or surpass such accuracy in benzene crystals , as we previously demonstrated for the benzene dimer@xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , which approximately solves the electronic schrdinger equation stochastically@xcite , can yield highly accurate energies for atoms@xcite , molecules@xcite , and crystals@xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) can provide accurate energies for vdw systems@xcite .",
    "dmc can also produce an accurate description of the phase diagram of materials under pressure@xcite . in general ,",
    "qmc - based methods are faster than the most accurate post - hartree - fock schemes for large number of particles n. the computational cost of qmc methods scales usually as @xmath13-@xmath14 depending on the method .",
    "we have demonstrated that qmc can provide chemical accuracy for the benzene dimer system@xcite .",
    "we have found optimal variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) and dmc binding energies of @xmath62.3(4 ) and @xmath62.7(3 ) kcal / mol .",
    "the best estimate of the ccsd(t)/cbs limit is @xmath62.65(2 ) kcal / mol@xcite .",
    "the consistency among our results , experiments , and quantum chemistry methods , is an important sign of the capability of the qmc - based methods to provide an accurate description of weak intermolecular interactions based on vdw dispersive forces .    in this study",
    ", we examine the z=4 to z=2 phase transition of crystalline benzene at low pressures .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 and @xmath1 structures as best candidates for z=4 and the @xmath2 structure for z=2 .",
    "we study pressures below 10 gpa .",
    "we obtain static and dynamic phase diagrams where the phonon contribution to the free energy is included .",
    "we employ different vdw functionals@xcite and compare them with conventional dft functionals .",
    "we perform qmc calculations to obtain the static enthalpy - pressure phase diagram of crystalline benzene . we will show that dmc provides accurate results for the phase diagram of crystalline benzene .",
    "given that the energy differences between crystalline benzene structures are small , the calculations must be performed with the highest possible numerical precision .",
    "our dft calculations were carried out within the pseudopotential and plane - wave approach using the quantum espresso suite of programs@xcite .",
    "all dft calculations used ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "pseudopotentials were obtained by pbe@xcite exchange correlation functionals .",
    "we used a basis set of plane waves with an energy cutoff 100 ry .",
    "geometry and cell optimisations employed a dense @xmath15 @xmath16-point mesh .",
    "the quasi - newton algorithm was used for cell and geometry optimisation , with convergence thresholds on the total energy and forces of 0.01 mry and 0.1 mry / bohr , respectively , to guarantee convergence of the total energy to less than 1 mev / proton and the pressure to less than 0.1 gpa / proton .    to include the effects of zero point energy ( zpe ) , vibrational frequencies",
    "were calculated using density - functional perturbation theory as implemented in quantum espresso@xcite .",
    "the zpe per proton at a specific cell volume @xmath17 was estimated within the quasi - harmonic approximation : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the numbers of vibrational modes in the simulation cell and phonon wave vectors @xmath22 , respectively , and the summation over @xmath22 includes all @xmath16-points on a @xmath23 grid in the brillouin zone .",
    "the thermodynamic properties are determined by the helmholtz free energy @xmath24 .",
    "the free energy can be written as the sum of an electronic and a vibrational term .",
    "the electronic entropy is negligible for insulators : @xmath25 . in our calculations ,",
    "the electronic part @xmath26 is obtained using the dmc method .",
    "thus , the main quantity to calculate for obtaining the thermal properties and finite temperature phase diagram is the vibrational free energy @xmath27 .",
    "we use quasi - harmonic approximation to calculate the vibrational free energy@xcite :    @xmath28 \\ } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 , @xmath17 , and @xmath30 are boltzmann constant , unit cell volume , and eigenvalue of the phonon hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "the pressures @xmath31 are calculated from the helmholtz free energies by @xmath32    we used the casino code@xcite to perform fixed - node dmc simulations with a trial wave function of the slater - jastrow ( sj ) form : @xmath33 \\det[\\psi_{n}({\\bf r}_i^{\\uparrow } ) ]     \\det[\\psi_{n}({\\bf r}_j^{\\downarrow } ) ] , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a @xmath35-dimensional vector of the positions of the @xmath36 electrons , @xmath37 is the position of the @xmath38th spin - up electron , @xmath39 is the position of the @xmath40th spin - down electron , @xmath41 $ ] is a jastrow factor , and @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] are slater determinants of spin - up and spin - down one - electron orbitals .",
    "these orbitals were obtained from dft calculations performed with the plane - wave - based quantum espresso code@xcite , employing trail - needs@xcite hartree - fock pseudopotentials . for the qmc study of c and ch - based systems ,",
    "the hartree - fock description of the core is more accurate@xcite .",
    "a detailed study of silicon also showed@xcite that hartree - fock provides the most accurate description of the core density compared with generalised gradient approximation and local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we selected a very large basis - set energy cutoff of 200 ry to approach the complete basis - set limit@xcite .",
    "the plane - wave orbitals were transformed into a localised `` blip '' polynomial basis@xcite .",
    "our jastrow factor consists of polynomial one - body electron - nucleus , two - body electron - electron , and three - body electron - electron - nucleus terms , the parameters of which were optimised by minimising the variance of the local energy at the vmc level@xcite .",
    "our dmc calculations were performed at two different time steps 0.01 and 0.02 a.u .",
    "the target population control is two times larger for time step 0.02 a.u .",
    "we extrapolated our dmc energies to zero time step using a linear fitting .",
    "the time step error is linear in the time step .",
    "the population control error also is linear as function of reciprocal of the target population .",
    "therefore , it is possible to remove both time step and population control errors simultaneously by linearly extrapolation to zero - time step .",
    "in this section we discuss the results of our geometry optimization .",
    "we study the evolution of benzene molecule distances by increasing the pressure .",
    "the structure optimization results are compared with experiments .",
    "the primitive unit cells of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 structures of solid benzene contain four , four , and two benzene molecules , respectively , as shown in figure  [ structures ] .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 structures have orthorhombic and tetragonal primitive unit cells , respectively , whereas the @xmath2 primitive unit cell is monoclinic .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     as the final step of our study , we calculated the lattice energy of crystalline benzene at ambient conditions .",
    "the cohesive energy yields the strength of the vdw forces holding the crystalline benzene together .",
    "we used our dmc and zp energies for @xmath0 structure .",
    "the cohesive energy is calculated using the difference between total energies of @xmath0 structure and its fragments .",
    "cohesive energy calculation is a precise test of dmc method , since it has to accurately describe two different systems of benzene molecule and crystalline benzene . the electronic structure of these two systems are not similar . in our dmc lattice energy calculation , we used same time step of 0.01 a.u for both crystal and molecule .",
    "we found an estimate of 50.6@xmath30.5 kj / mol for lattice energy .",
    "ab initio many - electron wave functions methods provide an estimate of 55.90@xmath30.76 kj / mol for benzene crystal lattice energy at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "the experimental lattice energy at same condition is 55.3@xmath32.2 kj / mol@xcite .",
    "we used conventional jastrow factor in our dmc calculations . in principle , the dmc lattice energy can be systematically improved by accurately taking into account the correlation energy and also decreasing the fixed - node errors .",
    "these purposes can be fulfilled by adding additional terms in jastrow factor and using backflow transformations@xcite . however , improving the dmc lattice energy until it converges to exact results requires huge amount of computational time .",
    "we have comprehensively studied the crystalline benzene phase diagram at pressures below 10 gpa .",
    "we have used different vdw functionals and also three most used conventional functionals to obtain dft energy of system .",
    "the vdw - df2 results of our study indicated that the @xmath0 and @xmath2 structures are the best candidates for phases i and ii , respectively . we have used the accurate dmc method to calculate the ground - state electronic structure energy of system .",
    "we have compared static enthalpy - pressure phase diagrams which are obtained by dft and dmc methods .",
    "we used quasi - harmonic approximation and density functional perturbation theory to calculate the phonon contribution to the free energy of system .",
