    "herbig ae ( hae ) stars are widely recognized as intermediate mass counterparts of low mass t tauri stars ( ttss ) @xcite . in the last few decades , it has been revealed that these stars are commonly accompanied by a circumstellar disk like ttss by direct imaging at infrared and radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "these disks are believed to be the precursors of planetary systems around hae stars , and are the important targets to study the formation process of a planetary system around an intermediate - mass star and to construct a general scenario for the formation of planetary systems .",
    "recent advanced instruments have revealed their physical properties , such as the disk mass , the radial temperature and surface density distributions , the outer radius of the disk , and the velocity field .",
    "the number of well - studied disks around hae stars , however , is still insufficient to establish a firm understanding of their physical conditions and their statistics ; only a few of limited examples of their structure have deeply been analyzed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "temperature distribution along the vertical direction of the disk should also be taken into account when one examines how the gas and dust inside the disk evolve .",
    "theoretical studies predict that flared circumstellar disks should have two or more layers with distinct temperature in vertical direction that are formed by diffusion of stellar radiation scattered at the disk surface @xcite .",
    "to examine vertical structure of the disks based on observations , it requires examples as many as possible , though several studies have already tried to make vertical temperature or density distributions unveiled @xcite .",
    "hd163296 is one of the best targets for this purpose because it exhibits strong emission from the disk in many co isotopologue lines .",
    "hd163296 is a star with a3v in spectral type @xcite .",

    "hd163296 is categorized in group ii by the feature of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and expected to have a self - shadowed disk @xcite .",
    "more recently , imaging studies with iram / pbi , sma , and vla both in continuum and in the @xmath0co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath8o emission lines were made @xcite , arguing that the disk radius is 550au and that the gas kinematics can be well explained by keplerian rotation .",
    "this paper presents multi - line observations of hd163296 with the nobeyama 45-meter ( nro 45 m ) radio telescope and the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) sub - millimeter telescope , and discusses vertical temperature distribution inside of the disk .",
    "the outline is as follows : details of the observations are described in section [ sec : observation ] , and the results are shown in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : model fitting ] ,",

    "observations of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) emission line were performed in winter 2006 by the nro 45 m telescope , operated by nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) , a branch of national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) . to separate the emission originated from the disk associated with the central star from surrounding components such as an envelope or a remnant cloud ,",

    "although the noise level in figure [ fig : figure4]c increases due to subtraction , there is no remarkable difference between these two profiles .",

    "model fitting is one of the effective methods to estimate physical properties of disks around hae / be stars @xcite .",
    "we fitted all the observational profiles , which are two co isotopologues emission lines with two different rotational transitions , with those calculated by the disk model ( details in section [ sec : disk model ] ) .",
    "we adopted a classical disk model which includes power - law forms of temperature and surface density distributions in radial direction with inner and outer cutoffs @xcite .",
    "the results are compared with the ones obtained by millimeter and sub - millimeter interferometers ( @xcite , details in section [ sec : interferometers ] ) .",
    "although the interferometric observations can provide detailed geometrical structure with high spacial resolution , it might be unable to detect the emission from the diffuse gas uniformly extending away due to spatial filtering effect .",
    "the single dish telescopes with large diameter , on the other hand , have higher sensitivity to the weak extended emission which interferometers can not detect well .",
    "interferometric and single dish observations are , therefore , complementary to each other , and comparing their results is a fruitful way to gain a better understanding of the disk nature .",
    "several assumptions for the disk structure and parameters are applied in the model fitting .",
    "first , the disk is assumed to have keplerian rotation as was proven to be the cases in other hae stars such as hd169142 and hd31648 @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out the existence of keplerian rotating disk around hd163296 from `` a butterfly shape '' seen in its position velocity diagram .",
    "secondly , the temperature distribution over the disk , @xmath32 , is assumed to follow a power - law form of the radius with its index of @xmath33 , as described by the following equation :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the radius in cylindrical coordinate system centered on the star and @xmath36 is the temperature at @xmath37 au @xcite .",
    "this assumption implies that the temperature is constant along the vertical direction ( @xmath38 ) at a certain @xmath35 . in reality ,",
    "a circumstellar disk should have temperature distribution along the @xmath38-direction . an elaborate disk model ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "predicts that the surface regions where the stellar radiation can penetrate and heat directly will have higher temperature than that in the interior regions , forming 2-layer temperature structure .",
    "single layer temperature model , however , can still be applicable because an optically thick line should have `` photosphere '' at each @xmath35 and its characteristic temperature can uniquely be determined .",
    "that is , vertical temperature distribution can be traced by a series of a different temperature of each co emission line .",
    "thirdly , the radial distribution of surface density over the disk , @xmath39 , is also assumed to follow a power - law form of the radius with its index of @xmath40 @xcite , as described by the following equation :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the surface density at @xmath37 au .",
    "fourthly , we assumed that density distribution in vertical direction can be achieved by hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the density distribution @xmath43 is , therefore , expressed by    @xmath44\\ , \\label{eq : rho}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the density at the mid - plane of the disk , and @xmath46 is the scale height given by    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is boltzmann constant , @xmath49 is gravitational constant , @xmath50 is the mass of the central star , and @xmath51 is the mean mass of gas molecules .",
    "thus , @xmath45 in equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) becomes @xmath52    fifthly , local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) is assumed .",
    "the number density of h@xmath53 at the position of photosphere of each co line can be estimated by the equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) . as shown in section [ sec : fitting results ] , the number density of h@xmath53 at the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) photosphere is calculated to be @xmath22 10@xmath54 @xmath55 at @xmath56 100 au , and it is higher than the typical value of critical density for @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) ( @xmath22 5 @xmath11 10@xmath57 @xmath55 at 60 k , fitting temperature of this line discussed in section [ sec : fitting results ] ) by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "lte assumption is sometimes inadequate for analysis of protoplanetary disks since it tends to overestimate the excitation temperature for a higher transition with a high critical density .",
    "however , @xcite evaluated many types of model calculations and found that lte approximation seems valid for the cases of @xmath1=43 or a lower transition of co. the lte assumption is , therefore , applicable in our model calculation for the @xmath1=10 and @xmath1=32 transitions of @xmath0co and @xmath2co .",
    "finally , the abundance ratios of h@xmath58 to @xmath0co and @xmath0co to @xmath2co are assumed to be 10@xmath59 and 60 , respectively , which are the typical values in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the disk is assumed to be heated only by a stellar radiation and accretion heating is neglected .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for a disk with modest accretion rate such as hd163296 case ( 7.6 @xmath11 10@xmath60 @xmath6 yr@xmath18 ; @xcite ) .",
    "all parameters regarding the object , listed in table [ tb : parameters ] , should be taken into account in the model calculation for the best accuracy , but some of them rarely affect the disk property .",
    "emission profiles are mostly characterized by three parameters , @xmath36 , @xmath42 , and the outer radius of the disk ( @xmath61 ) , and these are regarded as variables .",
    "the other parameters are fixed to be constants as listed in table [ tb : parameters ] .    in actual calculations ,",
    "@xmath42 was fixed in each run , and the possible fitting range of @xmath36 was searched .",
    "@xmath42 was set to be between 0.003 and 3 g @xmath62 .",
    "the search for @xmath36 in upper range of @xmath42 is stopped at 3 g @xmath62 because @xmath36 in each co line is well confined due to asymptotic behavior of fitting temperature in large @xmath42 region and the result remains almost the same .",
    "intensity is affected by both @xmath36 and @xmath42 in the case of optically thin disk and by only @xmath36 in the case of optically thick disk . among three variables ,",
    "@xmath61 can be guessed from the separation between two peaks in the profiles obtained from observation , since the keplerian velocity at @xmath61 ( @xmath63 ) roughly corresponds to half of the separation between the two peaks of the profile .",
    "@xmath641000 au is adopted as an initial guess and then adjusted .",
    "the best fit temperatures and outer radius at 0.1 , 0.3 , 1 , and 3 g @xmath62 in @xmath42 where fitting solution for all the co lines simultaneously exist are provided in table [ tb : best fit parameters ] , and the fitting results are shown in figure [ fig : figure6 ] .",
    "note that the observed profiles shown in figure [ fig : figure6 ] were re - sampled with velocity resolution of 0.08 km s@xmath18 for @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) line and 0.11 km s@xmath18 for the others to directly compare with the model calculations .",
    "as shown in table [ tb : best fit parameters ] , the fitting temperature of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) shows the highest value among all the co lines .",
    "it is essential to ascertain the goodness of the solution obtained in the model fitting .",
    "figure [ fig : figure7 ] shows fitting temperature at several specific @xmath42 between 0.003 and 3 g @xmath62 .",
    "we regarded the results as an acceptable fit when the following two conditions were met simultaneously : ( i ) to exclude the case of large deviation in amplitude of profiles , the residual in absolute value integrated over the range of @xmath65 2@xmath27 should be less than the uncertainty ( 1@xmath27 ) for the integrated intensity , ( ii ) to exclude the case of large deviation in line shape , more than 80% of the channels over @xmath66 should agree with the model calculations within 2@xmath27 .",
    "the best fit @xmath67 for the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) line in table [ tb : best fit parameters ] are between 58.5 @xmath17 9.5 k , and this range is significantly higher than those estimated for the other co lines , 31 @xmath17 15 k when @xmath42 is greater than 0.1 g @xmath62 .",
    "this difference in best fit @xmath67 implies that the disk is composed of at least two layers with distinct temperatures .",
    "the uncertainty of fitting temperature is smaller in higher surface density or large optical depth in the disk . in lower surface density ,",
    "the fitting temperature range becomes drastically larger or no solution exists ; @xmath2co ( @xmath1=10 ) emission line , for instance , dose not have any fitting temperature at @xmath42 less than 0.1 g @xmath62 .",

    "the radius derived from single dish observations , which generally have higher sensitivity to weaker emission , was 550@xmath82 au and was consistent with the one derived by interferometric observations .",

    ", @xmath87 is the permanent dipole moment , @xmath88 is the excitation temperature , @xmath89 is the velocity width of a gas molecule , @xmath72 is the inclination angle , @xmath90 is planck constant , @xmath1 is a rotational quantum number , and @xmath91 is the frequency of transition @xcite . note that @xmath84 is the value obtained by integrating the number density from the disk surface to the disk interior along a line of sight .    in this paper",
    ", we adopted @xmath92 for simplicity , where @xmath93 is the thermal velocity width of gas molecules expressed by    @xmath94    turbulent velocity ( @xmath95 ) can also contribute to @xmath89 .",
    "@xcite derived a turbulent line width of @xmath22 0.3 km s@xmath18 for the disk around hd163296 by fitting profile with high spectral resolution .",
    "previous observations also revealed that @xmath95 in disks around tts or hae star is comparable to @xmath93 : 0.07 - 0.15 km s@xmath18 in dm tau @xcite and 0.38 km s@xmath18 in ab aur @xcite .",
    "in such cases , however , the line profile calculated by the model is not altered significantly by @xmath96 because the line shape is mainly determined by keplerian rotation velocity .",
    "this assumption probably produces a factor of uncertainty for the estimation of @xmath84 but it does not significantly affect the following discussion .",
    "@xmath84 for each co emission line provides the information about the vertical location of the photosphere of each co emission line in the disk .",
    "figure [ fig : figure8 ] shows @xmath84 and vertical locations of photospheres of each co emission line .",
    "the results are provided in the case of @xmath97 k and 60 k , which are the representative values of the low temperature interior and the high temperature surface , respectively , as described in section [ sec : fitting results ] . to derive the location of each photosphere ,",
    "on the other hand , we select @xmath98 0.1 g @xmath62 as the representative case since this value is consistent with the results by @xcite . in both cases shown by figure [ fig : figure8 ] , @xmath84 results in the descending order of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) , @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath1=32 ) and @xmath2co ( @xmath1=10 ) , implying that the photosphere of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) emission is located uppermost among the four co lines .",
    "the total geometric cross section of grains per hydrogen atom ( @xmath99 ) in interstellar medium is @xmath2210@xmath100 @xmath101 at visible wavelength @xcite , hence the column density that makes the optical depth for the stellar radiation unity is 10@xmath102 @xmath62 .",
    "the grazing angle is assumed to be 0.05 in @xcite calculation , hence the column density of the upper layer should be about 5 @xmath11 10@xmath103 @xmath62 .",
    "this column density is consistent with the one above the photosphere of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) at @xmath104 au , as shown in figure [ fig : figure8 ] .",
    "@xmath84 of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) decreases faster than that of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) at @xmath105 au in the case of @xmath106 = 30 k because co molecules is not sufficiently excited to the @xmath1=3 level due to lower temperatures .",
    "the same phenomenon is seen in @xmath2co as well . from the comparisons between the fitting temperature and the vertical locations of the photosphere of each co line , the general trend is that the farther away the layer is from the mid - plane of the disk , the warmer it reaches .",
    "this is quite reasonable because the gas around the disk surface should be heated more by the radiation from the central star .",
    "when we derive @xmath84 in figure [ fig : figure8 ] , we assumed that the disk temperature is uniform in vertical direction .",
    "these considerations , however , might be invalid as a consequence of vertical temperature distribution ; the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) emission line originates from an upper layer of the disk , but this could also contribute significantly to the other co lines .",
    "we therefore evaluate how strongly such an upper layer affects the other co emissions .",
    "figure [ fig : figure9 ] shows how strongly the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) is emitted from above the photosphere of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) . in this figure",
    ", we first calculate the optical depth of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) emission line in the region above the photosphere of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) , and then the intensity of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) at the fitting temperature was compared with that originated from the region . the contribution of high temperature layer is less than 10@xmath107 of the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) intensity and can be safely neglected .",
    "therefore , the estimated vertical location of each co emission layer in figure [ fig : figure8 ] is validated .",
    "( 170mm,150mm)figure8.eps    ( 90mm,100mm)figure9.eps    as shown in figure [ fig : figure7 ] , the temperature of @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) and @xmath2co ( @xmath1=32 ) layers are almost the same when @xmath83 0.1 g @xmath62 .",
    "the temperature of @xmath2co ( @xmath1=10 ) layer seems to be even lower . such vertical thermal structure of irradiated accretion disks around tts has been theoretically predicted .",
    "@xcite constructed the detailed vertical structure models of irradiated accretion disks and extensively explored the dependence of the structure and emission properties on mass accretion rate , viscosity parameter , and disk radius .",
    "@xcite also propose a 3-layer disk model .",
    "the middle layer can form where the optical depth for the radiation reprocessed by the upper layer is less than unity .",
    "our results suggest the existence of such a three - layer structure .",
    "this paper presents observational results of the disk around hd163296 in @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) , @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath1=10 ) , and @xmath2co ( @xmath1=32 ) emission lines .",
    "double - peaked profiles originated from a rotating circumstellar disk were successfully detected in all the co lines .",
    "physical parameters of the disk such as temperature distribution , surface density distribution and outer radius are estimated by model fitting utilizing a disk model .",
    "these physical values obtained by single dish observation were confirmed to be consistent with the results of interferometric observations @xcite .",
    "the disk must be optically thick for all the co lines .",
    "taking advantage of difference in position of the photosphere among the co lines , we revealed temperature distribution in vertical direction .",
    "it is proven that there are at least two distinct temperature layers , possibly three layers , from the model fitting .",
    "the temperature in the uppermost @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) emitting layer is estimated to be @xmath3 k at 100 au from the central star , and it is about twice higher than that in the inner regions emitting the other co lines , @xmath4 k at 100 au . since the vertical temperature distribution inside of a disk",
    "is commonly suggested for both tts and hae stars ( dm tau , ab aur , and hd31648 ) , such a temperature distribution may be ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "the temperature and density structure of protoplanetary disks are still open questions .",
    "better knowledge such as the radial and vertical density distribution will be provided by high - resolution observations in upcoming alma era .",
