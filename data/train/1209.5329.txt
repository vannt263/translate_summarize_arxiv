    "it is well known that fluid dynamical behaviour of blood through an arterial segment having stenosis play a vital role in cardiovascular disease .",
    "the narrowing in the artery , commonly referred to as stenosis , is a dangerous disease and is caused due to the abnormal growth in the lumen of the arterial wall .",
    "stenosis may be formed at one or more locations of the cardiovascular system . as a result of such undesirable formation at the endothelium of the vessel wall , reduction of regular blood flow is likely to take place near the stenosis .",
    "if this disease takes a severe form , it may lead to stroke , heart attack and various cardiovascular disease .",
    "it has been observed that whole blood , being a suspension of blood cells in plasma , behave as a non - newtonian fluid .",
    "several attempts [ 1 - 8 ] have been made to understand the flow characteristic of blood through arteries under various assumptions .",
    "but most of these studies have failed to estimate on an important role in blood rheology is the motion of erythrocytes , white blood cells and platelets in plasma .",
    "+ eringen @xcite introduced the theory of micropolar fluid , which exhibits microscopic effects arising from the local structure and microrotation of fluid microelements are considered to be rigid .",
    "a subclass of microfluids such as liquid crystals , suspensions and animal blood are treated as micropolar fluid , which takes into account the rotation of fluid particles by means of an independent kinematic vector called the microrotation vector . with this end in view , several investigators [ 12 - 14 ] considered micropolar fluid as a blood flowing through an arterial stenosis .",
    "they suggested that blood exhibits remarkable non - newtonian properties , since blood is a suspension of neutrally bouyant deformable particles in viscous fluid .",
    "devanathan and parvathamma @xcite developed a mathematical model for steady flow of micropolar fluid through an arterial stenosis and their results indicated that the axial velocity is highly affected owing to the presence of microelements in the fluid .",
    "however , all the above studies did not considered the effect of body acceleration .",
    "although , under normal physiological conditions , flow properties of blood depends upon pumping action of the heart , which in turn produces a pulsatile pressure gradient through the cardiovascular system .",
    "although , there may be some another important situation under which human beings experiences whole body acceleration .",
    "it may occur for a short or a long period of time .",
    "such situations arise day to day life of human being e.g. , driving a vehicle , flying in an aircraft , due to which there may occur , the serious health problems like headache , loss of vision , increase of pulse rate and hemarage in face , neck and eye socket . keeping this in mind , several investigators [ 16 - 24 ] carried out their studies pertaining to blood flow through stenosed arteries with a periodic body acceleration .",
    "chakravarty and sanniggrahi @xcite studied theoretically the flow characteristics of blood through an artery in the presence of multi - stenosis when it is subjected to whole body acceleration .",
    "wherein they considered a flexible cylindrical tube containing a homogeneous newtonian fluid with variable viscosity characterising blood .",
    "but all the above studies neither consider the effect of body acceleration on pulsating blood flow nor includes the effect of magnetic field when blood is considered to be micropolar fluid model .",
    "+ since blood consists of suspension of red cells containing hemoglobin , which contains iron oxide , it is quite apparent that blood is electrically conducting and exhibits magnetohydrodynamic flow characteristics . if a magnetic field is applied to a moving and electrically conducting fluid , it will induce electric as well as magnetic fields .",
    "the interaction of these fields produce a body force known as lorentz force , which has a tendency to slow down the fluid motion .",
    "such analysis may be useful for pumping of blood and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .",
    "the magnetic field can also be used for controlling blood flow during surgery .",
    "many authors [ 26 - 29 ] have investigated the flow of blood through arteries in the presence of magnetic field under different situations .",
    "the steady mhd flow of a viscous fluid in a slowly varying channel in the presence of a uniform magnetic field was explored by misra et al @xcite .",
    "recently misra and shit @xcite investigated the flow and heat transfer of a viscoelastic electrically conducting fluid under the action of a magnetic field .",
    "they made an observation that the temperature of blood increases as the strength of magnetic field increases is likely to be useful in the development of new heating methods .",
    "+ with the above discussion in mind , a good attempt is made in the present theoretical investigation to examine the pulsatile blood flow characteristics through a stenosed artery experiencing periodic body acceleration by treating micropolar fluid model for blood in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "the motivation of this study is to analyze the effect of microrotation component and axial velocity when an external magnetic field and body accelerations are applied .",
    "in addition , in view of the information stated above , we have also performed a heat transfer phenomena of the problem in question .",
    "let us consider a fully developed unsteady , laminar , incompressible and axially symmetric two dimensional flow through a stenosed artery .",

    ", we assumed that the flow variation is independent of @xmath8 .",
