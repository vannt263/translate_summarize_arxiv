    "the nonlinear properties of low - dimensional electron systems attract a great deal of attention for its fundamental significance as well as for potentially important applications in nanoelectronics . in response to microwave radiation and @xmath8 bias , strongly nonlinear electron transport@xcite that gives rise to unusual electron states",
    "@xcite has been reported in two - dimensional systems of highly mobile electrons in a high magnetic field .",
    "there has also been great interest in the nonlinear response of quantum ballistic constrictions , where the effects of quantum interference , spatial dispersion and electron - electron interaction play essential roles @xcite .",
    "recent experiments , in which a @xmath8 electric field applied to highly mobile 2d electrons placed in strong magnetic fields , have demonstrated a variety of fascinating nonlinear phenomena @xcite .",
    "oscillations of the nonlinear magnetoresistance with a magnetic field , which appear at a finite @xmath8 bias , have been reported @xcite .",
    "these interesting oscillations , decaying at high temperatures @xcite , are attributed to landau - zener transitions between landau levels @xcite . at",
    "substantially smaller @xmath8 biases another important class of nonlinearities has been identified @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study in detail the effect of the small @xmath8 electric field @xmath9 on the longitudinal resistance of two - dimensional electrons in gaas quantum wells placed in a strong magnetic field .",
    "in such a magnetic field the density of states of the 2d electrons is modulated due to the landau quantization of the electron motion .",
    "the electric field @xmath9 decreases the resistance significantly @xcite .",
    "the effect , existing in a broad range of temperatures , can not be explained by an increase of the electron temperature due to the heating by the electric field @xmath9 @xcite . in the paper",
    "@xcite the effect is attributed to a non - uniform spectral diffusion of the 2d electrons induced by the electric field @xcite .",
    "the spectral diffusion produces a specific distribution of 2d electrons in the quantized spectrum , which is significantly different from the canonical fermi - dirac form .",
    "in fact the observed strong nonlinearity is result of the deviations of the electron distribution from the fermi - dirac function .",
    "the effect is considerably enhanced in electron systems with high mobility and high electron density .",
    "the high electron mobility provides strong absolute variations of the density of states and the spectral diffusion with electron energy , increasing appreciably the magnitude of the non - temperature deviations .",
    "the high electron density provides substantial decrease of the electron - electron scattering , which makes the relaxation of the deviations to be weak .",
    "effects of an electric field @xmath9 on the resistance of two dimensional electrons placed in strong magnetic fields have been studied in many works @xcite .",
    "substantial part of these studies was focused on an effect of the electric field @xmath9 on an amplitude of quantum oscillations of the resistivity .",
    "the quantum ( shubnikov de haas , sdh ) oscillations are result of the quantization of the electron spectrum in strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations depends significantly on the electron temperature @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the amplitude of the sdh oscillations decreases with the electric field @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the effect is attributed to an increase of the electron temperature @xmath10 due to the electric heating .",
    "the explanation is based on an assumption that the surplus of the joule energy provided by the electric field @xmath9 is rapidly shared among the carriers through electron - electron interaction , establishing the thermal ( fermi - dirac ) distribution at an elevated temperature @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 approximation works well in systems with a strong electron - electron scattering .",

    "the approximation has been widely and successfully used for 2d electron systems with low electron density and/or mobility @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that a substantial discrepancy between the temperature @xmath11 , obtained from the analysis of the amplitude of the quantum oscillations in the @xmath11 approximation , and the one obtained , using another experimental method , has been reported in gaas 2d systems with a high electron mobility @xcite .    despite the apparent applicability of the @xmath11 approximation to the overheated electron systems",
    ", recent studies have revealed an inadequacy of the temperature description of the nonlinear transport of highly mobile 2d carriers @xcite . instead of the @xmath11 approximation in this paper we use a different approach @xcite .",
    "below we evaluate the distribution function , using an equation of the spectral diffusion . in the computations",
    "any assumptions regarding the shape of the electron distribution function are relaxed .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath11 approximation the new approach to the heating via the direct evaluation of the electron distribution function is more universal and accurate .",
    "it takes into account , in principle , @xmath12 the broadening ( `` temperature '' increase ) of the distribution function @xmath13 the deviations of the distribution function from fermi - dirac form in response to the electric field @xmath9 .",
    "the later appears to be the dominant source of the strong nonlinearity observed in highly mobile 2d electron systems at small electric fields .",
    "the spectral diffusion is limited by an electron inelastic relaxation , which moves the electron system back to thermal equilibrium .",
    "it opens new possibilities to study inelastic processes and nonlinear electron kinetics of low dimensional systems . in the present paper",
    "we explore these possibilities .",
    "we study the effect of electric fields on the resistivity in a broad range of magnetic fields and temperatures .",
    "we compare the experimental results with numerical simulations of the spectral diffusion .",
    "the comparison gives the inelastic scattering time of 2d electrons in a broad range of magnetic fields and temperatures .",
    "in the temperature interval @xmath3 for overlapping landau levels , the inelastic scattering rate @xmath4 is found to be proportional to the square of the temperature , indicating the dominant contribution of the electron - electron interaction into the relaxation of the electron distribution function . at a strong magnetic field , at which landau levels are well separated , the nonlinear resistance demonstrates an interesting scaling behavior . in this regime at high temperatures the inelastic scattering rate is found to be proportional to @xmath6 , indicating leading contribution of the electron - phonon scattering to the inelastic relaxation . at low temperature and",

    "the conjecture of the independence of the inelastic time @xmath2 on the electric field @xmath9 is supported by direct evaluation of the variation ( broadening ) of the distribution function , which is found to be small at the @xmath8 biases used in the experiment .",

    "moreover at @xmath80 the energy space available for inelastic scattering of an electron inside landau sub - band contains , in fact , all levels of the sub - band .",

    "the experiment and the theory demonstrate a remarkable correspondence even at a strong variation of the nonlinear resistance .",
    "this behavior is unexpected since the strong variation of the resistance implies a substantial deviation of the electron distribution function from the equilibrium and , therefore , an apparent inapplicability of the @xmath77 approximation with the constant @xmath2 . below we provide arguments , which shed a light on this interesting phenomenon .    at a strong magnetic field ,",
    "at which landau levels are well separated , the spectral diffusion between landau levels is absent due to the lack of the available electron states ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "in this regime the total broadening of the distribution function is absent and , therefore , the total number of landau levels participating in the spectral diffusion is fixed .",
    "there is , however , a spectral diffusion inside landau levels , generating local spectral flows .",
    "since the spectral diffusion conserves the total number of particles and since there is no electron transport between landau levels , the total number of electrons inside any landau level is preserved and equal to the thermal equilibrium value despite considerable deviations of the electron distribution function from the thermal equilibrium inside the level .",
    "it is clear that in this condition the total number of empty states in each landau level is also fixed and equal to the value at the thermal equilibrium ( at zero @xmath8 bias ) .",

    "this regime holds at relatively high temperature : @xmath82 .    at low temperatures @xmath83 the only one landau level",
    "is involved in electron transport and at the thermal equilibrium the electron distribution changes strongly inside the level .",

    "deviate substantially from the experiment ( see fig.[b0784t]c ) , indicating a limited applicability of the approximation at the low temperatures .",
    "the numerical calculations are done in several steps .",
    "the goal of the first step is to find the density of electron states @xmath84 from a comparison with the experiment .",
    "the density of states @xmath84 of the 2d electrons can be approximated by different theoretical expressions @xcite .",
    "we have found that the numerical results for the temperature dependence of the inelastic scattering rate are robust with respect to particular choice of the expressions for the density of states ( see below ) .",
