    "this analysis suggests that a diffusing cl atom can take a path of minimum energy barrier following the edges of hexagon from t - site to t - site through the barrier of @xmath7=13 mev at b - site .",
    "this energy barrier is in fair agreement calculated by wehling et al.@xcite we note that this barrier is very low and allows cl atom to migrate on the surface of graphene as if it rolls along the edges of hexagon .",

    "the band structure of a single cl adsorbed to each ( 4x4 ) supercell of graphene presented in fig .  [ f1 ] ( d ) has filled chlorine states appearing as flat bands . in view of the negligible dispersions of these bands associated with cl and the analysis of the bands corresponding to ( 5x5 ) and ( 6x6 ) supercells in the following section we concluded that a cl adsorbed to each ( 4x4 ) supercell can mimic successfully the single , _",

    ", they form cl@xmath0 molecule and desorb from graphene surface , since cl - cl interaction energy becomes stronger than the sum of the binding energies of two cl atoms to graphene ( 2.20 ev ) . accordingly , the gain of energy through the formation of cl@xmath0 is 1.26 ev per molecule .",
    "this explains also why chlorination of graphene is endothermic .",

    "though the chlorographene belongs to the same space group with ch and cf,@xcite the phonon frequencies are lowered ( softened ) due to the saturation of c atoms with heavy cl atoms . while la and ta modes have linearly dependent to phonon wave vector , za mode has a quadratic dispersion in the vicinity of @xmath69-point.@xcite as compared to single layer graphene , lo and to ( zo ) optical modes are softened from 1600 ( 900 ) to 1061 ( 421 ) @xmath70 due the existence of surrounding cl layers . in general , both phonon bands calculated using sdm and dfpt agree well , but they slightly differ at m and k point for optical phonon branches near at 500 @xmath70 .",
    "group theory analysis shows that the decomposition of the vibration representation at the @xmath69-point is @xmath71 . among these , the modes at 105 , 398 , 715 and 1042 @xmath70 are bond stretching modes and are raman - active .",
    "raman mode @xmath72 at 1042 ( 398 ) is entirely due to the out - of - plane vibration of c and cl atoms moving in the same ( opposite ) direction with respect to each other .",
    "the observation of these raman active modes are expected to shed light on the cl coverage and the structure of chlorinated graphene .",
    "the observation of characteristic d - peak at 1330 , g - peak at 1587 and 2d - peak at 2654 @xmath70 from chlorinated graphene indicates low coverage of cl.@xcite since the raman measurements were performed in the range of 1250 - 3500 @xmath70 , possible raman - active peaks originating from chlorine atoms could not be observed .",
    "corrected valance and conduction bands are shown by dashed line and red balls .",
    "the zero of energy set to the fermi level @xmath44 .",
    "( b ) density of states projected to various orbitals ( pdos).,width=321 ]      here we investigate whether ccl is stable at finite temperature , even though all phonon modes having positive frequencies in the brillouin zone indicate its stability at t=0 k. this is achieved by carrying out ab - initio molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations at finite temperatures using @xmath73 supercell involving 144 c and one cl atoms . here",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "at relatively low temperatures , for example at t=500 k , the perfect ccl remained stable even after @xmath516000 time steps of 2 fs .",
    "even if 6000 time steps large for ab - initio calculations , but low to attain a reliable statistics , this result suggests the stability of perfect ccl near room temperature .",
    "however , cl atoms dissociate from ccl at 1000 k. this may be interpreted that ccl can not be stable at elevated temperatures .",
    "ab - initio md calculations with single cl vacancy at one side brought about the formation of a second vacancy at the other side after 200 time steps at 500 k. thereafter , the structure continued to be stable . however , an island of cl at both sides of graphene , for example , 6 cl atoms adsorbed to a hexagon of graphene alternatingly from the top and bottom side of graphene is found unstable .    our analysis using finite temperature ab - initio md calculations led us to draw the following conclusion from the above results : a perfect ccl is stable at t=0 k and can remain stable possibly at room temperature .",
    "the creation of a single vacancy at one site imposes the formation of a second vacancy at the opposite side .",
    "this pair of vacancy can survive at room temperature .",
    "however , ccl having vacancies or holes is vulnerable to dissociation through the formation of cl@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the negative formation energy underlies these instabilities .",
    "we present the band structure and the orbital decomposed density of states of fully chlorinated graphene ccl in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . as",
    "a consequence of transition from @xmath64- to of @xmath55-type bonding and the mixing with cl orbitals through cl - c covalent bonds , linearly crossing semimetallic bands of graphene changes dramatically and turn to a nonmagnetic semiconductor with a direct band gap of @xmath741.21 ev ( gga+vdw value : 1.55 ev ) at the center of bz .",
    "the two - fold degenerate bands at the top of valence band are mainly composed of the @xmath75 valence orbitals of cl and c atoms and belong to the e@xmath76 irreducible representation .",
    "however , non - degenerate conduction band edge is formed by the hybridization of c-@xmath75 , c-@xmath77 , c-@xmath78 and cl-@xmath77 and belongs to the a@xmath79 irreducible representation .",
    "calculated values relevant for the electronic properties of ccl are given together with those of graphene , ch and cf in table [ table ] .",
    "ccl has the lowest band gap ( 1.21 ev ) among graphene derivatives , i.e. graphane ( @xmath743.42 ev ) and fluorographene ( @xmath742.96 ev ) .",
    "our calculations also reveals that the experimentally observed energy gap of 0.045 ev may arise from the partially chlorinated regions .",
    "since dft usually underestimates the band gaps , the band gap of 3d bulk crystals are successfully corrected by gw@xmath80 self - energy method . in the present paper",
    "we apply gw@xmath80 method to correct valance and conduction bands and hence the band gap of ccl .",
    "we found the corrected band gap 4.33 ev .",
    "this is a dramatic increase .",
    "similar situation occurred for the correction of band gaps carried out for single layer structures , such as bn@xcite , cf@xcite and mos@xmath0@xcite .",
    "in particular , while lda predicted band gap of single layer mos@xmath0 agrees with experiment , gw@xmath81 correction yielded very large band gap .",
    "this situation led us to question whether gw@xmath81 correction is suitable for single layer structures .",
    "while graphane have a positively charged surface due to the electron transferred from h to c atoms , cl layers of ccl are negatively charged since 0.13 electrons ( gga+vdw value : 0.10 electrons ) are transferred from c to cl atoms .",
    "we also note that the effective charge is reduced from 0.42 to 0.13 electrons by going from ionic c - cl bond in single cl adsorption to the covalent c - cl bond of chlorographene . since ccl surfaces are negatively charged , it is possible to lower the photoelectric threshold of graphene from 4.49 ev to 3.67 ev by covering its surfaces with chlorine atoms .",
    "in contrast , as one notices in table [ table ] , both fluorinated@xcite and hydrogenated@xcite derivatives of graphene have photoelectric thresholds higher than graphene and ccl . the lower photoelectric threshold provide materials highly emissive surfaces .",
    "this facile photoemission feature is desirable for fast laser applications.@xcite      earlier studies have shown that graphane@xcite and fluorographene@xcite derivatives are strong materials like graphene .",
    "among the three graphene derivatives chlorographene is the thickest one and we can expect some different mechanical properties .",
    "we will discuss the structural rigidity of chlorographene within the harmonic range of the elastic deformation , where the structure responded to strain @xmath82 linearly and reversibly . in the elastic range",
    ", in - plane stiffness @xmath83 would be a good measure of the response of material .",
    "here we use the expression to calculate in - plane stiffness , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the equilibrium area of the supercell and the strain energy is defined as the total energy at a given uniform strain minus the total energy at zero strain , namely @xmath86 . here the strain in one direction is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the equilibrium lattice constant of supercell and @xmath89 is its stretching . for ccl we calculated @xmath83 as 186 @xmath90 which identifies it as strong as ch and cf .",
    "( curves at the right hand side ) and its derivative with respect to applied uniform strain @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath91 , ( curves at the left hand side ) are calculated for ccl , ch and cf . after the maxima these structures become unstable and undergoes a plastic deformation .",
    "( b ) variation of the band gap with uniform strain .",
    "calculations performed in ( 5x5 ) supercells.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ f8](a ) we show the variation of the strain energy @xmath92 and its derivative with respect to the applied uniform strain , @xmath93 .",
    "the latter is linear for small @xmath82 in the harmonic range .",
    "the elastic deformation occurs until the maximum of @xmath91 , whereby the structure attains its initial state when the applied strain is lifted . beyond the maximum",
    "the structural instabilities sets in with irreversible deformations .",
    "the region beyond the maximum is called plastic region .",
    "it seen that ccl undergoes instability , under 0.15 expansion of the lattice . whereas , the critical expansion values are 0.20 and 0.24 for cf and ch , respectively .",
    "we also calculated the effect of elastic strain on the band gap of ccl , cf and ch and presented our results in fig .",
    "[ f8](b ) .",
    "ch and ccl have similar response to elastic strain : the increase of their band gaps for small strain is followed by a rapid decrease for large strain .",
    "in contrast , initially the band gap of cf does not show any significant increase with increasing strain ; for small strain it is almost unaltered , but decreases rapidly for large strain .",
    "because of its smaller band gap , the metalization of ccl occurs earlier in the course of expansion .",
    "motivated with the recent work by li et al.@xcite , who achieved the photochemical chlorination of a bare graphene , we performed a first principle study on the chlorination of graphene starting from a single cl adatom adsorption to fully chlorinated graphene ccl .",
    "we found that even if a cl atom can be bound to graphene with a significant binding energy , it can migrate on the surface of graphene almost without an energy barrier .",
    "formation of a cl@xmath0 molecule from two individual , migrating adatoms is energetically favorable when they are at close proximity .",
    "therefore the formation energy of the adsorption of a single cl atom relative to cl@xmath0 molecule is negative . in this respect ,",
    "all possible configurations or decoration obtained by the chlorination of one surface of graphene and considered in this study are not stable . on the other hand , the configuration , where two cl atoms are adsorbed from opposite sides of graphene to two adjacent carbon atoms forming @xmath1-type covalent c - cl bonds and hence inducing buckling are stable , since the dissociation of these two cl atoms by forming cl@xmath0 molecule is hindered .",
    "once the bare graphene is fully chlorinated from both side inducing buckling of carbon atoms , the resulting conformation named as chlorographene , is stable at t=0 k and also possibly at room temperature . with its 1.21 ev direct band gap , stiff mechanical properties and response to homogeneous strain this",
    "material displays interesting properties for future technological applications . on the other hand , the nonbonding chair conformation has cohesive energy higher than that of chlorographene in the chair conformation and",
    "is found to be unstable . while both structures are not in ground state , chlorographene corresponds to a local minimum on the born - oppenheimer surface .",
    "of course , a state having the energy lower than those of both conformation is cl@xmath16 molecules , which are weakly attached to bare graphene .",
