    "the boundary dynamics in this system was considered first by saffman and taylor in 1958 @xcite .",
    "they observed a relatively stable finger ( known today as the saffman - taylor finger ) formed after a competition of many fingers generated by an interfacial instability .",

    "the correspondence between the eigenvalues is established by their local behavior around the origin .",

    "we expect the solutions to reproduce , after a proper rescaling , the saffman - taylor fingers in the channel geometry . in the rest of this section",
    "we show that this is indeed the case .",

    "second , passing to the channel of a finite width ( say @xmath285 ) requires the rescaling of the physical plane @xmath286 . at last , in order to be closer to the finger tip one should shift the origin . taking this into account ,",
    "it is not difficult to see that the correct limit to the channel geometry is [ ch1 ] f_ch ( w)= _ n performing this limit with the @xmath287 given above , one obtains [ ch2 ] f_ch ( w ) = w + 2(1- ) ( 1-w^-1 ) which is the standard form of the saffman - taylor finger with the relative width @xmath288 .",
    "note that the hypergeometric function behaves as @xmath289 and so does not contribute to @xmath290 .",
