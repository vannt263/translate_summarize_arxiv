    "sculptors manifest ideas as material objects .",
    "we use a system wherein an idea is symbolized as a solid , governed by a set of rules , such that the sculpture is the expressed material result of applying rules to symbols .",
    "the underlying set of rules , being mathematical in nature , may thus lead to enormous abstraction and although sculptures are generally thought of as three dimensional objects , they can be created in four and higher dimensional ( unseen ) spaces with various projections leading to new and pleasant three dimensional sculptures .",
    "the interplay of mathematics and the arts has , of course , a very long and old history and we can not begin to elaborate on this matter here .",
    "recently however , the problem of creating mathematical programs for the construction of ribbed sculptures by charles perry was considered in @xcite . for an insightful paper on topological tori leading to abstract art see also @xcite .",
    "spiral and twirling sculptures were analysed and constructed in @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with a technique for sculpting works mostly based on wood ( but not necessarily restricted to it ) using abstract ideas based on twirls and tori , though again , not limited to them .",
    "the construction is based on the idea that a solid toroidally equivalent structure can be built in such a way that its cross - sections are curvilinear quadrangles that twirl , rotate and dilate as one follows a typical arm from its starting point and then back to it .",
    "the more basic fels scuptures ( see figure 1 , left ) are reminiscent of the work of helaman ferguson @xcite where the cross sections are now curvilinear triangles ( the _ ariadne torus _ ) though the surfaces are usually encoded with a surface filling curve .",
    "such sculptures are the work of the first author who has been creating these for over 25 years .",
    "a sculptor has a choice of using an existing language of form or creating one s own specific set of rules .",
    "the ancient greeks , michelangelo , and rodin ( figure  [ fels6 ] ) all employed the relationships inherent in the human body as a pre - existing set of rules when defining their language of sculptural forms .",
    "david rabinovitch ( figure  [ fels7 ] ) took the rules of sculptural language to the extreme by creating sculptures simply by sending rules to a fabricator .",
    "for example , a steel fabricator would be given the rule,make it higher on the right  as the complete language of form for the fabrication of a sculpture .        in the mid 20th century",
    "brancusi ( figure  [ fels9 ] ) used reductionism to finding a personal language of form ; wherein multiple versions of the same sculpture gradually revealed the simplest language of form for the expression of brancusi s concept or idea .",
    "henry moore derived the rules of his sculptural forms from careful examination of natural objects in conjunction with the human form , resulting in understandable abstractions ( figure  [ fels10 ] ) .",
    "more recently sculptors have been creating works of such multifarious materials and combinations of images and ideas that the language or languages of form employed in the work are complex and hard to identify ( e.g. , figure  [ fels8 ] )        in his sculptures fels searched and found a language of form balanced between innate human feelings and understanding of three - dimensional form and a rigorous simple set of underlying rules ; wherein the rules are consistent from sculpture to sculpture but do not limit the expression of complex ideas .",
    "for example the sculpture ` sailing through time ' was constructed using the mathematical ideas elucidated below .",
    "fels rules pay homage to human experience , for example the twists of the sculptures relate to movement and change in human attitude , captured in a set of rules amenable to mathematical scrutiny unique to both fields .",
    "moreover , as discussed in this paper , fels language of sculptural form mathematically leads to a dramatic expansion of the concept of sculpture in higher dimensions and directly enables real - time interactive sculptural expression and creation on a virtual pallet .",
    "let @xmath0 be four distinct points in the euclidean plane and assume that each pair of points @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is joined by a piecewise differentiable _ non - self - intersecting _ curve ( ususally convex or concave in this paper ) .",
    "the resulting planar figure is then called a _ curvilinear quadrilateral _ or _ curvilinear quadrangle _ and denoted by the symbol , @xmath5 .",
    "it follows that a curvilinear quadrilateral is a closed jordan curve @xcite having a finite area .    since",
    ", in the sequel , all such quadrangles are composed of natural materials ( e.g. , wood ) curvilinear quadrilaterals will have a mass density function @xmath6 that can be used to define its _ center of mass _ , @xmath7 , where the coordinates @xmath8 , @xmath9 are given by the usual @xmath10 where @xmath11 , the mass of the quadrangle , is given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 is an element of area in euclidean coordinates , @xcite .    in the absence of a mass - density function",
    "we replace the center of mass concept by the point intesection of the main diagonals of the quadrangle under investigation .",
    "now , let @xmath14 denote a closed non - self - intersecting differentiable curve in euclidean space , @xmath15 , parametrized by the ( position ) vector field @xmath16 , where , without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath17 lies in some finite interval @xmath18 : = 0 \\leq t \\leq a$ ] ( where @xmath19 is a fixed positive real number ) . since @xmath14 is closed , it is necessary that @xmath20 .",
    "we define a sequence of _ planar _ curvilinear quadrangles @xmath21 , for @xmath17 in @xmath18 $ ] with the property that the center of mass of @xmath21 coincides with @xmath22 , for a given parameter value , @xmath17 .",
    "( this property is an essential feature of a _",
    "fels sculpture_. ) it is also necessary that all four vertices of such a typical quadrangle be coplanar .",
    "we will assume , in addition , that the sequence or family , @xmath21 , of such quadrangles deforms continuously ( in the sense of topology ) for our @xmath17 .",
    "intuitively , this means that as one moves from a quadrangle @xmath23 to @xmath24 along the curve @xmath14 one can expect that their areas , perimeters , etc . be close provided that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are close .",
    "there is one more caveat , however .",
    "said deformation is also assumed to _ shrink _ ( i.e. , areas decrease ) and _ rotate _ a quadrangle @xmath21 , for @xmath27 , in an initially clockwise ( or initially counterclockwise ) direction until , _ in the simplest of cases _ , a single distinguished value @xmath28 is reached , where @xmath29 ( corresponding to a maximum rotation by an angle @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is determined uniquely by @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 has minimal area amongst all quadrangles in the family .",
    "when @xmath35 the deformation proceeds in the same initial direction so that the areas of the @xmath21 now increase and , in the end , @xmath36 exactly ( i.e. , the vertices all match as do the quadrangles ) .",
    "the resulting , necessarily , non - self - intersecting solid structure @xmath37 in three - dimensional space , consisting of the union of all such quadrangles @xmath21 for @xmath17 in the interval @xmath18 $ ] , is called a ( simple ) _ fels sculpture_.        thus , roughly speaking , a simple fels sculpture can be thought of as a three - dimensional toroidal structure ( topologically equivalent to a doughnut or torus ) with surface cross sections being curvilinear quadrangles of decreasing and increasing areas , amongst which there is only one cross section having minimal area ( and thus only one having maximal area , by construction ) . in other words , for a given simple fels sculpture there is a unique cross - section having minimal area and a unique cross - section having maximal area .",
    "( this latter observation becomes a _ requirement _",
    "below when considering complex fels sculptures . )        in practice there is much insight to be gained by starting with circles ( instead of quarangles ) whose centers lie on the curve @xmath14 and satisfy the same conditions , as figures , as do the quadrangles",
    ". this will give a tubular solid .",
    "one can then _ shave off _ four sets of arcs to create quadrangles of the desired shape thus completing the fels sculpture ( figure  [ fels18 ] ) .",
    "of course , the above construction applies to three - dimensional simple fels sculptures though there is nothing exceptional in the underlying space being of dimension equal to three .",
    "the construction presented here , being purely mathematical , may be extended to any finite number of dimensions to form fels sculptures in hyperspace ( see the end ) .",
    "depending on the angle being viewed these can then be projected back into three dimensions to give a new ( angle - dependent from four dimensions ) fels sculpture in three dimensional euclidean space .",
    "* example *    we now show specifically how such a simple fels sculpture can be created ( virtually or _ on paper _ ) from first principles .",
    "let s start with the three dimensional curve , @xmath14 , ( figure  [ fels12 ] ) given parametrically on the interval @xmath18 = [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] by defining its position vector to be @xmath38 this is a closed non - self - intersecting differentiable curve in @xmath15 with the property that for any fixed @xmath17 , the normal vector , @xmath39 , at the point @xmath40 is given by @xmath41    , from which a fels scultpure may be derived .",
    ", width=340 ]    the plane cross - section to @xmath14 at a point @xmath42 is ( by definition ) given by the plane that contains both the point @xmath43 and the straight line , @xmath44 , through @xmath43 parallel to @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", we see that @xmath44 may be described parametrically by the equations ( in cartesian coordinates ) @xmath45 where the parameter @xmath46 varies over the real numbers .",
    "since the tangent vector , @xmath47 , to @xmath14 and the normal to the plane @xmath48 coincide , the equation of this plane cross section @xmath48 through @xmath43 at @xmath42 is given by @xmath49 next , the angle , @xmath32 , @xmath50 , between this plane @xmath48 and the plane @xmath51 ( i.e. , the @xmath52-plane ) is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the usual unit vector in the @xmath56-direction .",
    "substituting our value for @xmath39 we get @xmath57 now the euclidean sphere @xmath58 centered at @xmath43 intersects the plane @xmath48 in a circle of radius @xmath59 whose projection onto the plane @xmath51 is given by the elliptical curve @xmath60 a continuous deformation of the type required by the above construction may now be seen by letting @xmath59 diminish with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "the _ speed _ of the deformation is unimportant here , just that such a deformation exists , and this is now clear .",
    "for example , we can let @xmath59 vary with @xmath17 according to , say , @xmath61 up to a critical value @xmath28 where we now produce a deformation that forces @xmath59 to _ increase _ for @xmath62 until the final / original circle is reached .",
    "( note that rotations of the basic circular figure here lead nowhere due to the complete symmetry of the circle with respect to rotations . )",
    "the resulting solid is a closed tubular surface .",
    "we show briefly how the construction of ferguson s _ ariadne torus _",
    "@xcite , denoted briefly by at , without the incised space filling curve , can essentially be subsumed in the present context .",
    "although we do not have an original ferguson sculpture before us to compare angles , etc .",
    "the idea should be clear .",
    "consider a vertical cross section @xmath48 of the at ( defined as the plane @xmath48 containing the normal vector to a point @xmath43 on the boundary of at and orthogonal to the tangent vector at @xmath43 ) , cf .",
    ", figure  [ fels2 ] .",
    "the intersection of @xmath48 with the at defines a hyperbolic triangle , @xmath63 , maybe even an _",
    "equilateral _ hyperbolic triangle ( although this is a guess ) .",
    "the curve containing all the centers of mass of these cross - sections is clearly closed and appears to have an elliptical projection onto a plane .",
    "the triangle @xmath63 is now dilated and rotated up to a maximum angle of roughly @xmath64 , thus making @xmath65 in the above discussion on fels sculptures . now choose an @xmath19 .",
    "since the final  triangle \" does not match the original one ( as it is a rotation of the original @xmath63 ) this meets all the requirements of a simple fels sculpture except for the assumption that the final triangle match the original triangle exactly ( no rotations of the initial figure are allowed in the fels case ) .",
    "we can imagine that there is no need for the restriction that the base cross - sections of our three - dimensional sculptures be either triangles ( as in ferguson ) or quadrangles ( as in the present discussion of the fels case ) .",
    "the analysis of the construction of fels sculptures for quadrangles as discussed above may be extended to cover @xmath66-sided curvilinear polygons ( whether they are planar or not ) and a finite sequence , @xmath67 , of special parameter values , @xmath33 , in the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the same rules apply since all that needs to be done is replace the word _",
    "quadrangle _ by an arbitrary @xmath66-sided , possibly non - planar , polygon and then replace the one value of @xmath33 by a finite sequence of such between each of which there is a special ( initially fixed ) clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the polygons during the continuous deformation .",
    "in addition , for a given fels sculpture there is always the requirement that there is a unique cross - section having minimal area and a unique cross - section having maximal area .",
    "of course , in this case , there must exist cross - sections of the sculpture having a locally minimal ( resp .",
    "locally maximal ) area .    in another development , fels considered the possibility of the center of mass curve intersecting itself _ tangentially _ thus forcing the quadrangular structure of the sculpture to create solids that are no longer toroidal and of essentially arbitrary genus ( figures  [ fels16 ] ,  [ fels15 ] ) .",
    "examples of curvilinear quadrangles in the setting of a _ sequence _ of special parameter values , @xmath67 , between each of which the rotations vary from clockwise to counterclockwise by a specific angle , are shown below in figure  [ fels15 ] .",
    "select two unique quadrangles and use the respective centroids as nodes wirelessly connected to two gloves for your hands . as you move your hands",
    ", you shape the sculpture in real time while the language , as controlled by the software , modifies the sculptural form accordingly .",
    "this can be as complex or as simple as you like .",
    "this process enables ongoing exploration and changes of expression of the form through human gesture .",
    "for example , interfacing with music is definitely possible generating a projected three - dimensional ` light organ ' .",
    "the human spirit , therefore , can be personified through virtual sculpting .",
    "the capture of human movement with wearable sensors is well suited to creating real time virtual sculpting using the language mathematically described in this paper .",
    "we propose a simple example as follows :        in figure  [ fels14 ] default red and orange quadrilaterals are preprogrammed as stationary in time and space relative to each other as projected on a screen .",
    "there are two gloves wherein : each glove has a sensor in the palm representing the centroid of an orange quadrilateral .",
    "each glove has 4 sensors , one on the thumb and three on its nearest fingertips , representing the vertices of the respective orange quadrilateral .",
    "the person modifies the orange quadrilaterals though virtual space and real time through the following rules :    moving the hands in space changes the locations of the orange quadrilaterals relative to each other and to the default red and yellow quadrilaterals .",
    "these variations are programmed to follow the sensor in the palm of each glove .",
    "the vertices of the orange quadrilaterals are programmed to be expanded away or towards their respective centroids by opening and closing the fingers .",
    "note the language restricts the area of each of the orange quadrilaterals to larger than the yellow quadrilateral .",
    "the programming based on the language would fill in all other quadrilaterals between the default red , yellow , and orange quadrilaterals , in the smoothest curve , as per the language of form defined here .    in this simple example , moving your hands shapes the sculpture in real time because the language , as governed by the mathematics , modifies the sculptural form accordingly",
    ". this can be as complex or as simple as you like .",
    "this process enables ongoing exploration and changes of expression of form through human gesture .",
    "finally the restriction to our own visually motivated three - dimension al world is for esthetic purposes only .",
    "there is no real need to make such a restriction on mathematical grounds since the construction there may be formulated for any number of finite or even infinitely many dimensions . to bring these sculptures back _ down _ to our world",
    "all that is needed is a suitable three - dimensional projection .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that a fels - like - sculpture in four dimensional space may generate many , many different projections each being a three - dimensional fels - sculpture in its own right . in this case",
    ", the process begins with an arbitrary curve in four - dimensional space ( containing the centers of mass of our four , or even lower dimensional , dimensional quadrangles ) and an arbitrary @xmath66-sided polygon where @xmath66 , the number of sides , is fixed .",
    "this can also be called an @xmath66-sided _ @xmath11-polytope _ , where @xmath11 is the dimension in which it resides . using analytic geometry one can write down the equations of a typical continuous deformation of such a polytope and create mathematically real fels sculptures in four dimensional space .",
    "of course , we can not visualize such a sculpture but we _ can _ see its projections back into our space .",
    "* example *    we consider the closed four - dimensional curve given parametrically by @xmath68 of course , this curve can not be sketched but its various _ projections _ in three dimcnsional ( humanly visible ) space can be manifested easily using software suited for this purpose ( e.g. , maple^^ ) .",
    "this four dimensional ( center of mass ) curve may be used to create the wireframe of many different three dimensional fels sculptures ( see figure  [ fels17 ] ) using the ideas presented earlier .",
    "here we show its four main projections on the three - dimensional @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 spaces , and then those projections onto the plane of this reading surface .",
    "observe that the four curves in figure  [ fels17 ] are not self - intersecting when viewed in three dimensions , though they are when viewed in two ( because of the nature of projections ) . once the wireframes are constructed",
    "the rest is a matter of artistic license subject to the basic principles outlines in this work .    ,",
