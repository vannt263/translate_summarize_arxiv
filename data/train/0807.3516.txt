    "near the critical point of a second order phase transition both the relaxation time ( which determines `` reflexes '' of the system ) and the healing length ( which sets the scale on which its order parameter `` heals '' in space , i.e. , returns to its equilibrium value ) diverge : @xmath0 above , @xmath1 is a dimensionless parameter which measures the distance from the critical point .",
    "for instance , when the transition is caused by the change of the temperature @xmath2 or by varying the parameter @xmath3 of a hamiltonian , @xmath1 is , respectively , given by ; @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the critical values .",
    "divergences in @xmath7 and @xmath8 that appear near the critical point as a consequence of these two equations are often referred to as _",
    "critical slowing down _",
    "( for obvious reasons ) and as _ critical opalescence _",
    "( as the fluctuation on a scale @xmath8 that becomes large in the vicinity of a critical point cause , in some systems , variations of the optical properties on scales @xmath9 , which leads to opalescence ) . these divergences will play a crucial role in our discussion .",
    "phase transitions are usually investigated as _ equilibrium _",
    "phenomena in _ homogeneous _ systems .",
    "but many intriguing questions arise when a system is driven at a finite pace from one phase to another . that this will inevitably happen in the cosmological setting",
    "was first pointed out by kibble  @xcite , who noted that  because of relativistic causality",
    " cosmological phase transitions in a variety of field theoretic models necessarily lead to formation of topological defects ( such as monopoles or cosmic strings ) and may have dramatic astrophysical consequences .",
    "it was later pointed out by one of us @xcite that analogs of cosmological phase transitions can be studied in the laboratory , and that the _ equilibrium _ critical scalings eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tau1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : xinu]) can be used to predict various aspects of non - equilibrium dynamics of symmetry breaking , including the density of topological defects left behind by a non - equilibrium second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the resulting theory ( known as `` kibble - zurek mechanism '' or kzm ) uses critical scalings of the relaxation time and of the healing length to estimate the size @xmath10 of the domains that choose the same broken symmetry @xcite . owing to the universality of phase transitions",
    ", kzm can be applied on many energy scales , from the ( cosmologically relevant ) high energy settings ( including experiments such as rhic or lhc ) , all the way to bose - einstein condensates at ultra - low temperatures .    in all of these situations",
    "a frequent prediction is that the process of symmetry breaking will lead to the formation of topological defects .",
    "this is essentially inevitable when the broken symmetry phase ( characterised by the homotopy group ) permits their existence  @xcite .",
    "following the transition , topological defects should appear with the density of about one defect unit ( e.g. , one monopole or one @xmath10-sized section of a string ) per @xmath11-sized domain .",
    "the value of @xmath10 that results from this _ non - equilibrium _ process can be deduced from the _ equilibrium _ near - critical behaviour . estimating this size is therefore essential .",
    "here we first summarise the key ideas and equations that lead to such estimates",
    ". we shall then investigate the behaviour of the order parameter in an inhomogeneous system , where the change between phases is imposed by a slowly varying externally controlled parameter , such as the field in the quantum ising model .",
    "we shall calculate how far does the transition region between the two phases persist  how much does a symmetry that prevails on one side of the critical line `` bend '' before it breaks , spontaneously , on the other side .",
    "we consider a second order phase transition that is traversed at a finite rate set by the quench timescale @xmath12 , @xmath13 the system will be able to adjust its state adiabatically as long as the rate of change imposed from the outside is slow compared to its reaction time given by @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau1 ] ) .",
    "this change from nearly adiabatic to approximately impulse behaviour will happen at an instant @xmath14 when @xmath15 thus , the state of the system s order parameter will in effect `` freeze '' at @xmath16 its evolution will restart only @xmath14 after the critical point is passed .",
    "the instant @xmath14 plays a key role in the establishment of the fluctuations which seed structures ( such as topological defects ) in the broken symmetry phase @xcite .",
    "the key instant @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath17 which in turn sets the characteristic spatial scale given by the corresponding healing length @xmath18 this is the estimate of the size of regions that break symmetry in a more or less coordinated manner  @xcite .",
    "our derivation subverts equilibrium properties of the system  its scaling in the vicinity of the critical point  to predict non - equilibrium consequences of the quench .",
    "the density of topological defects left behind in the wake of a phase transition is the best known ( but not the only ) example of such predictions of kzm .",
    "these predictions were tested , extended and refined with the help of numerical simulations @xcite , and verified in a variety of increasingly sophisticated and reliable experiments in liquid crystals @xcite , superfluids @xcite , superconductors @xcite , as well as other systems @xcite .",
    "the majority of the experiments to date are consistent with kzm .",
    "the case of superfluid @xmath19he may be an exception . there",
    "the initial reports of detection of kzm vortices @xcite were retracted @xcite after it turned out that the observed copious vorticity was inadvertently induced by stirring .",
    "it is still not clear if @xmath19he behaviour is really at odds with the kzm predictions re - evaluated in view of the refined numerical estimates  @xcite .",
    "one problem is that the decay of vortex tangle generated by kzm may be faster than that generated by stirring : kzm leads to anticorrelations between neighbouring vortices , so phase ordering kinetics is expected to proceed faster than when vortices are correlated , as when they originate from turbulent flows .",
    "an accessible recent summary of the experimental situation due to kibble @xcite is a highly recommended and up - to - date complement to this brief discussion .",
    "further experiments that may allow for a better control of various parameters would be obviously welcome .",
    "gaseous bose - einstein condensates are one recent and very promising proving ground  @xcite that has already yielded some exciting results  @xcite .",
    "recently , kzm theory was applied to quantum phase transitions @xcite . there , the system is at @xmath20 , and the nature of its ground state changes discontinuously as a result of a continuous change of some parameter of its hamiltonian . at the critical value of that parameter",
    "the _ gap _  energetic price of the lowest excitations , given by the difference between the energy of the ground and the first excited state  is at its minimum , and it disappears in the limit of an infinite system . in a finite system the quantum phase transition is then described by an avoided level crossing . the basic observation due to damski  @xcite is that kzm can be used to analyse the avoided level crossing process , and that it yields results in excellent agreement with landau - zener theory @xcite .",
    "as we shall see below , the analogy is based on the observation that , far away from the avoided level crossing , the quantum system usually starts its enforced evolution adiabatically , as was the case for second order phase transitions .",
    "however , it can only react on the relaxation timescale given by the inverse of the gap .",
    "therefore , near the avoided crossing  where the gap closes  its reflexes deteriorate , and the impulse approximation in the immediate vicinity of a quantum critical point is appropriate . below",
    "we give an illustration of kzm in action in the exactly solvable and paradigmatic quantum ising model .",
    "according to sachdev @xcite the _ quantum ising model _ is one of two prototypical examples of quantum phase transitions .",
    "it represents a chain of spins with the hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 are pauli operators , @xmath23 is the ising coupling , and @xmath24 is due to the external ( e.g. , magnetic ) field that attempts to align all spins with the @xmath25-axis .",
    "the phase transition from the paramagnetic state where all the spins are aligned with @xmath25 by the strong external field ( e.g. , @xmath26 ) to the low - field ferromagnetic and degenerate ( in the large @xmath27 limit ) ground state that `` lives '' in the hilbert subspace spanned by the broken symmetry basis @xmath28 and @xmath29 takes place when @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , as suggested by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon1 ] and  [ eq : epst ] ) , a key role is played by the _ relative coupling _ given by @xmath31 and we assume that it depends linearly on @xmath32 .",
    "all the relevant properties depend on the size of the _ gap _ @xmath33 between the ground state and the first excited state . in an infinite system",
    "the gap is given by : @xmath34 the spectrum ( and the gap ) of a finite quantum ising system are illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the gap sets the energy scale and is reflected in the _ relaxation time _ and the _ healing length _ @xmath35 the latter given by the product of @xmath7 and the speed of sound @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath37 is the distance between spins .",
    "the divergence of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the critical slowing down and the analogue of critical opalescence , respectively .",
    "the instants @xmath38 when the behaviour switches from adiabatic to impulse happen when the reaction time of the system , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) , is the same as the timescale on which its hamiltonian is altered ( given by @xmath39 ) , i.e. @xmath40 and thus @xmath41 as before , for @xmath42 , the state of the system will continue to adjust adiabatically to changes imposed by the decreasing @xmath24 .",
    "however , at @xmath43 before the critical point the evolution will cease , and it will re - start only at @xmath44 after the transition , with the initial state similar to the one `` frozen out '' at @xmath45 .    using the relative coupling @xmath46 associated with @xmath14 we get @xmath47 following kzm , we now predict appearance of @xmath48 defects per @xmath10 .",
    "their density should be approximately @xmath49 per spin .",
    "this is only an estimate : simulations of classical second order phase transitions yield defect densities that scale with @xmath12 in accordance with this reasoning , but are lower than the relevant power of @xmath10 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xihat1 ] ) so that a `` unit of defect '' is often separated by @xmath5010 - 15 @xmath10 ; see e.g. @xcite .     with open ( rather than periodic ) boundary conditions .",
    "the ground and the first accessible excited state that define the gap are marked with a thicker line . ]",
    "there is a fundamental difference between quantum and thermodynamic phase transitions . in the thermodynamic case ` real ' fluctuations exist above the critical point .",
    "they can initiate the symmetry breaking process  in effect , choose how symmetry breaks in domains that appear after the transition . in the case of quantum phase transition",
    "there are only ` quantum fluctuations ' , but they are virtual , so one can not be certain that they will have an analogous effect on the post - transition state . therefore , an explicitly quantum approach to the quantum ising model is needed .",
    "as we have already noted , a key feature of a quantum phase transition is the gap @xmath33 .",
    "actually , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] , the relevant gap ( i.e. the gap between the ground and the first accessible state ) is not the symmetric @xmath33 but rather @xmath51 on the approaching side .",
    "nevertheless , in the quantum ising model the gap disappears at the critical point when the system is infinite . when @xmath52 , this critical gap becomes small , but does not disappear , ( see fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "this is important , and allows us to propose a purely quantum approach : instead of density of defects in an infinite system we can compute ( as a function of quench timescale @xmath12 ) the length of the spin chain that , with probability @xmath53 of about a half , can remain defect - free ( in a ground state ) after the quench .",
    "an excited state would ( most likely ) contain just a single excitation ( e.g. , a kink ) .",
    "therefore , the _ inverse _ of the length that limits the excitation probability to approximately @xmath54 should correspond to about half of the kink density .",
    "the two lowest accessible levels of @xmath55 in the vicinity of the critical point ( fig .  [ spectrum ] ) exhibit an avoided level crossing and we can calculate the excitation probability of the system driven through this avoided crossing using the landau - zener formula ( lzf )  @xcite , @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the minimum gap between the two levels and @xmath58 is the velocity with which the transition is imposed on the system given by @xmath59 far away from the avoided crossing .",
    "the kzm approach was shown by damski to provide an excellent approximation to lzf @xcite ( see also @xcite for extensions ) .",
    "using lzf we compute the size @xmath60 of the spin chain that will probably remain in the ground state in course of the quench with probability @xmath61 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lzf ] ) translates into a condition for the rate of quench that produces a kink with probability @xmath53 , @xmath62 using @xmath63 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) ] and @xmath64 for the gap upon `` closest approach '' we get @xmath65 this relates the size @xmath60 of a chain that will remain defect - free with the probability 1-@xmath53 to the quench rate : @xmath66 this lzf estimate is ( surprisingly ) accurate for @xmath67 even though there are many levels in the spectrum of the quantum ising model .",
    "such accuracy was surprising when this analysis was first presented  @xcite .",
    "dziarmaga  @xcite has soon after demonstrated that this is no accident  in effect , the phase transition in the quantum ising model can be decomposed into a collection of independent avoided level crossings .",
    "we can now directly compare kzm , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nhat ] ) , and lzf predictions for defect density : @xmath68 the two estimates exhibit the same scaling with the quench rate and with the parameters of @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .     and ending at @xmath69 , plotted as a function of the quench rate @xmath70 for @xmath71 ( solid lines ; bottom to top ) .",
    "the scaling @xmath72 predicted by kzm is consistent with the simulations ( see @xcite for details of the numerical method ) .",
    "agreement improves with the size of the system : for 100 spins a fit gives @xmath73 ( dashed line ) .",
    "as in the classical case  @xcite eq .",
    "( [ eq : nhat ] ) is an overestimate ; the best fit is @xmath74 . *",
    "( b ) * total number of kinks for @xmath71 spins ( dashed lines , bottom to top ) after a quench as a function of the quench rate @xmath70 . both the scaling @xmath75 predicted by kzm ( solid , straight lines ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nhat ] ) , and the lzf estimate @xmath53 ( solid , bend lines ) when less than one kink is expected are valid .",
    "the straight lines are linear fits in the range ( 0.025,0.25 ) yielding slopes between 0.66 and 0.58 .",
    "numerical data include these used in ( a ) but we now go beyond the expected range of validity of kzm . for sufficiently slow quenches lzf provides reliable predictions .",
    "very fast quenches are `` all impulse '' , levelling off of the expected number of kinks , as is indeed seen . ]",
    "lzf predicts fewer defects than `` raw kzm '' ( @xmath76 when @xmath53 is set  somewhat arbitrarily  to 0.5 ) .",
    "this is not a big surprise  as seen in the numerical simulations , confirmed by the experiments and verified analytically in specific models , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xihat1 ] ) and ( [ eq : nhat ] ) provide correct scalings , but tend to overestimate densities ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "[ lzfkzm ] indicates that this conclusion holds also for the quantum ising model .",
    "figure  [ lzfkzm ] also shows that the kink density scales approximately as @xmath77 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nhat ] ) , in the region of the validity of kzm , i.e. for @xmath46 less than 1 ( so that quench is quasi - adiabatic at the beginning and at the end , but impulse near the critical point , i.e. , when at least one defect is expected ) .",
    "the prefactor which is approximately @xmath78 [ 0.12 if the steeper slope on the approach in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] is taken ] is not far from the previous experience @xcite .",
    "for very slow quenches ( @xmath79 , or @xmath80 ) , i.e. if the system is nowhere convincingly ` impulse ' , lzf is surprisingly accurate .",
    "we conclude that the two approaches work well in complementary regimes of quench rates , and predict the same scaling of the size of broken symmetry domains with quench time .",
    "the importance of the behaviour of the gap ( and , in particular , of the smallest gap @xmath57 ) for the quantum estimate of defect density is  in addition to the broader theme of connections between kzm and lzf  our principal general conclusion at this point .",
    "we shall return to discuss the gap in the quantum ising model and utility of extensions of kzm and lzf to more complicated behaviours of the near - critical gap below .",
    "consider now a situation where the all - important dimensionless @xmath1 is _ time - independent _ , but depends on the location in space instead .",
    "we suppose  in analogy with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : epst ] ,  [ eq : epsilon ] )  that in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath81 is approximately linear : @xmath82 clearly , sufficiently far from @xmath83 the order parameter will settle into an equilibrium state corresponding to the local value of @xmath1 .",
    "we are however left with an interesting question : how far  and how  does the influence of the critical point propagate ?    there is an intriguing analogy between the freeze - out in time we have discussed in the preceding section and the freeze - out in space we are led to consider here : when @xmath1 changes in space slowly compared to the local healing length given by @xmath84 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : xinu ] ) , the order parameter will be able to adjust in space to the changes of @xmath1  i.e. , there should be a well - defined local value of the order parameter , local healing length @xmath8 , and local relaxation time @xmath7 , etc .",
    "however , very close to @xmath83 the system can not `` heal '' fast enough : the healing length becomes large , much larger than @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , the critical opalescence ",
    "the divergence of @xmath85  will open up a `` scar '' in the order parameter that does not properly heal .",
    "our aim now is to describe the consequences . to find out the size of the scar we write down the spatial analogue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : that2 ] ) , @xmath86 for the `` adiabatic - impulse '' borderline point , @xmath87 .",
    "thus , @xmath88 consequently , and in accord with previous discussion , we conclude that the order parameter will in effect `` freeze '' ( or , to put it differently , that the scar opened up by the transition through the critical region will heal ) at a distance @xmath89 from the critical point .",
    "the distance @xmath87 corresponds to @xmath90 we are really done ",
    "there is just a spatial @xmath25 , rather than both @xmath25 and @xmath32 , as before . but let us ( as a consistency check ) repeat and take a few more steps , and use this estimate of @xmath46 to calculate the characteristic spatial scale given by the corresponding healing length , @xmath91 we know this already [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : xhat3 ] ) ] .",
    "this is now the estimate of the size of the scar  the size of the region that is  still thinking \" about how to break symmetry .",
    "earlier , our derivation of the freezeout time and of the resulting analysis of the dynamics of symmetry breaking subverted equilibrium properties of the system  its scaling in the vicinity of the critical point  to predict non - equilibrium consequences of the quench .",
    "we have now repeated this subversive strategy in a new setting , by using the healing length ( that is , strictly speaking , defined in a _ homogeneous _ system ) to find out consequences of inhomogeneity that must be there in the vicinity of the critical point if the phase transition takes place in space .",
    "the structure of the scar in the order parameter that connects the two phases is now of interest _",
    "per se_.    there are two specific values of @xmath92 that are often encountered : as we have seen in the preceding section , for quantum ising model @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 and the size of the scar is simply a geometric average of the two relevant lengths in the problem .",
    "we shall see below that , as a consequence , in the quantum ising model the presence of such a scar widens a critical gap . in a mean field theory",
    "we have @xmath95 .",
    "consequently , @xmath96 the thickness of the boundary between the two layers is a compromise that involves the characteristic healing length of the order parameter on one hand , and the typical scale of the externally imposed inhomogeneity of the hamiltonian on the other . the extent to which each of them has its say depends on the scaling exponent @xmath92 . the most obvious test of these predictions",
    "would then explore variations of the order parameter in the vicinity of an externally imposed inhomogeneity .",
    "to illustrate our considerations with a concrete example we return to the quantum ising model we have already employed in the previous section .",
    "the hamiltonian we shall use now has the same form as before , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , but the field @xmath97 , which before was the same for every spin , now has a form illustrated in fig .  [ slant ] . as a result ,",
    "sufficiently far to the left of @xmath98 the system will be in a paramagnetic phase , while to the right a ferromagnetic phase should be dominant .     in the transverse quantum ising model we consider .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 corresponds to @xmath24 from hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) but now depends on position , @xmath100 .",
    "the spins are located at positions @xmath101 with @xmath102 . ]",
    "our task is to characterise the state of such a system . in a homogeneous quantum ising spin system",
    "the correlation function given by @xmath103 is a well defined object , whose behaviour is thoroughly explored  @xcite . indeed , the decay of such correlation functions is used to define the coherence length ( which is in effect often equal to the healing length we have employed earlier ) . in a homogeneous system @xmath104 obviously does not depend on the `` reference spin '' @xmath105 : each spin `` lives '' in an identical neighbourhood , so @xmath106 is translationally invariant with respect to @xmath105 .",
    "but when a system is inhomogeneous  for example when a phase transition occurs at some point within the system  the correlation function will obviously depend on where the reference spin @xmath105 is .",
    "we therefore consider a conditional correlation function , @xmath107 it depends explicitly on the location of the reference spin @xmath105 .",

    "@xmath108 is independent of @xmath105 , so this averaging is trivial . on the other hand , in an inhomogeneous system we are investigating here",
    ", such averaging would be counterproductive : the averaging would obscure precisely the signature we are looking for , i.e. , the imprint made by the inhomogeneity of the hamiltonian on the state of the system .",
    ", for @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    "the behaviour of @xmath108 seen there is a good illustration of our previous discussion : for spins located in the ferromagnetic region @xmath116 .",
    "however , when @xmath117 assumes values such that @xmath118 falls within the paramagnetic region , the correlation function vanishes , @xmath119 . the transition between these two extremes is our focus of interest .",
    "we can characterise the size of the `` scar '' by quantifying the width of the transition regime . the most obvious way to do",
    "this is through the inverse of the slope of @xmath108 where @xmath120 .",
    "the resulting width of the transition region is plotted in fig .",
    "[ corrfunction]b . evidently , the behaviour predicted by the kzm - like discussion for the quantum ising model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : xhatising ] ) , is reflected in the correlations between spins .",
    "such correlation functions should be experimentally accessible , and may be a good way to test our predictions .",
    "we note that some of the effects of the inability of the order parameter to adjust to the inhomogeneous variations of the hamiltonian may become apparent even if the system does not cross `` all the way '' into the other phase .",
    "for instance , just coming close to the critical point may lead to the structures with sizes that can be estimated using the above approach .",
    "similarly , when the same phase is separated by a narrow strip when the parameter that controls its phase crosses the critical point ( i.e. , a strip in space within which @xmath1 has a different sign than outside it ) , an extension of the above discussion should be applicable .",
    "there should be therefore lots of opportunities to experimentally test the above equations , and plenty of variations of the homogeneity - inhomogeneity theme .",
    "one such obvious variation involves adopting a nonlinear spatial dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath25  i.e. , a dependence that is different from eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsx ] ) .",
    "but there are clearly many more",
    ". we shall not attempt to enumerate them here .",
    "let us instead point out a less obvious consequence of a spatial inhomogeneity that will be especially important in quantum phase transitions : its effect on the gap .",

    "( ii ) moreover , this plateau is lifted above where it was ( at @xmath122 ) for a chain of @xmath27 spins . in short , the sharp gap minimum we had",
    "before becomes now a wider , extended `` bottleneck '' .     versus @xmath98 .",
    "the ground and the first accessible excited state that define the gap are marked with a thicker line . ]    the spatial structure induced by the inhomogeneity in the state of the system should have an effect on their energetics .",
    "indeed , one could venture a guess ( based on `` general principles '' ) that the size of the gap  which is the property of the whole inhomogeneous spin chain  will change with the size of the scar , @xmath87",
    ". one could moreover speculate ( and here the `` general principles '' are becoming too general for comfort ) that the size of the gap should be inversely proportional to ( some power of ) @xmath87 .",
    "we shall now pose this very same question more precisely , and arrive at the estimate of the basic parameters of the `` bottleneck '' more directly .",
    "the inhomogeneous ising system we are dealing with can be typically divided into three regions : a _ ferromagnetic domain _ ( where the ising coupling @xmath23 dominates ) , a _ paramagnetic domain _ ( where @xmath99 is large ) and what s in between these two  the _ near - critical domain _ , where @xmath123 is small .",
    "the energetic price of excitations in either ferromagnetic or paramagnetic domains is large compared to the size of the gap , which ( we remind the reader ) in a near - critical chain of @xmath124 spins is given by @xmath125 .",
    "our aim is to compute the size of the bottleneck gap in the inhomogeneous case of fig .",
    "[ slant ] .",
    "we shall do that by a self - consistent estimate suggested by the above division of the whole inhomogeneous system into three domains .",
    "we first note that the energetic price of the excitations outside the near - critical regime is prohibitively large whenever these regimes are well defined , so such excitations will not be relevant for the calculation of the size of the gap ( which is defined as the `` price '' of the least energetically expensive excitation ) . on the other hand , the near - critical domain should be able to support collective excitations that  when the size of that domain is @xmath124  should be able to support collective eigenstates with energies given by @xmath126 .",

    ", it rests on the near - critical behaviour of @xmath8 .",
    "while the healing length is defined in a homogeneous system , we have employed its variation with @xmath1 ( dimensionless parameter that measures the distance from the critical point ) to predict what happens near a critical point that occurs in space in an obviously inhomogeneous system .",
    "the resulting theory yields the size of the scar of the transition region between the two phases .",
    "we have applied these results to the quantum ising model . there",
    "the gradient of the external field leads to a gradual re - alignment of the spins .",
    "the border between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases has a structure that can be characterised by the correlations between spins , which change between the two patterns of alignment .",
    "we have seen that this change is gradual , and happens ( as was predicted by our theory ) on the scale inversely proportional to the square root of the gradient of the field . the simple theory leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xxihat ] ) results in correct scaling behaviour .",
    "as expected , a more specific calculation based on the quantum ising model leads to a different prefactor , eqs .",

    ", we now have two different measures of the size of the scar , one based on the correlations , fig . [ corrfunction ] , and the other on the size of the gap .",
    "we do not know which one of them ( if any ) is `` correct '' , but we point out that they can differ .",
    "existence of the `` transition scar '' has a dramatic effect on the eigenspectrum of the system .",
    "in particular , instead of the simple avoided level crossing where the minimum gap helps set the probability that the system will remain in its ground state we are now dealing with a an extended `` bottleneck gap '' . parameters of this bottleneck gap are ( including a prefactor , somewhat in contrast with the case of the scar size estimates ) in a surprisingly good accord with the theory .",
    "one is now tempted to consider quantum phase transitions that occur both in space and in time . for thermodynamic phase transitions",
    "this situation can be treated by the kzm - based approach of kibble and volovik @xcite .",
    "their conclusion was , in effect , that when the critical line moves through space with velocities in excess of @xmath142 , the quench that leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking will proceed as if it were homogeneous , and kzm estimates of defect densities relevant for homogeneous quenches will apply .",
    "on the other hand , in the limit of slowly propagating phase fronts defect production will be suppressed , as the symmetry breaking choices made by the order parameter will be simply propagated with the phase front .",
    "this conclusion seems to be only weakly influenced by the spatial gradient of @xmath1 , and is now supported by numerical studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our preliminary numerical simulations of the same problem in the quantum case indicate that there the situation is more complicated .",
    "part of the problem can be traced to the fact that the dynamics of a quantum phase transition is strictly reversible .",
    "thus , the energy deposited in the order parameter stays in the order parameter , and ",
    "e.g. , in the quantum ising model  has `` nowhere to go '' except into the kinks . as a result ,",
    "the rate of creation of kinks now depends on the spatial gradient of @xmath1 , and does not become suppressed as dramatically as before when the front velocity falls below @xmath143 .    , @xmath144 ( solid line ) .",
    "the slant is moving with a constant velocity @xmath145 across the spin chain , i.e. @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 is chosen such that the flat part of the spectrum begins at @xmath148 .",
    "the dashed lines are linear fits to the solid line in order to get parameters for a landau - zener type two - level hamiltonian the excited state of which is given by the dotted line .",
    "( b ) upper line : solution of a landau - zener type problem with an energy spectrum given by the dotted line in ( a ) .",
    "the function oscillates rapidly around the value @xmath149 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the lower line shows the excitation probability for @xmath150 , @xmath144 .",
    "the dashed line is a fit leading to @xmath151 . ]    moreover , in quantum phase transitions , the limit when less than a single kink is expected in the whole system is explicitly quantum , and ( as we have seen earlier ) different than ( although compatible with ) the kzm scaling .",
    "however , in an inhomogeneous case the simple landau - zener formula ( suitable for gaps of fig .",
    "1 ) is obviously inapplicable .",
    "we have tried out its natural generalisation ( which approximates the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ spectrum_inh ] with two obvious avoided level crossings connected with a plateau ( see fig .",
    "the fit is imperfect .",
    "the resulting prediction of the probability of a kink , fig .",
    "[ lz]b , is also not very satisfying .",
    "but this calculation ( while it predicts spurious oscillations , and overestimates the rate by about an order of magnitude ) does capture one essential feature : the dependence of the probability @xmath53 on the quench rate @xmath152 is now no longer exponential , as it was in the original lzf , but it becomes quadratic .",
    "such quadratic dependence appears automatically , if rather surprisingly  given the exponential nature of lzf , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lzf ] )  in the avoided level crossing problem when the transition starts at the place of the nearest approach of the two levels  @xcite , rather than far away from the avoided crossing , as is usually assumed  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour we observe may be due to the asymmetry of the gap .",
    "in effect , as the slanted potential of fig .  [ slant ] traverses the spin chain , the system will generally approach the plateau of the bottleneck gap with a slope that is quite different from the slope on the other end of the gap , where it exits .",
    "therefore , recent study  @xcite  showing that when avoided level crossing is traversed starting at the minimum of the gap , the probability of excitation @xmath53 on the quench rate @xmath152 is no longer exponential but that it becomes quadratic  becomes relevant .",
    "for instance , in the case of the asymmetric gap of fig .",
    ", one can imagine that the system is delivered essentially in its ground state to the bottleneck of the gap . while @xmath98 moves along the flat part of the gap , the hamiltonian of the system is unchanged , so no transitions happen .",
    "however , as the gap opens up , now with a steep slope , one is really starting an avoided level crossing transition from a system that is still in its ground state near the end of the plateau . clearly , conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite apply .",
    "while these preliminary insights are encouraging , more work is needed to gain a complete picture .",
    "in addition to the obvious intrinsic interest of this problem there are applications that may benefit from its thorough understanding .",
    "let us mention one , slightly speculative : _ adiabatic quantum computing",
    "_ rests on the idea that a known ground state of a simple hamiltonian can be adiabatically transformed into an initially unknown ground state that solves a problem encoded into the structure of another hamiltonian .",
    "the rate at which this transition can be accomplished is limited by the size of the gap ",
    "faster transitions will result in errors appearing at the rate given by lzf , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lzf ] ) .",
    "this will severely limit the speed of the adiabatic computation  its duration will increase exponentially with the inverse of the size of the gap .",
    "but we have seen above that a gap can be widened , and the rate of transitions can be brought down from exponential to quadratic in @xmath152 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether ( and how ) these changes can be used to suggest improvements in adiabatic quantum computing , but the preliminary results we have reached here are certainly suggestive .",
    "this research was supported by the ldrd program funded by doe at the los alamos national laboratory .",
    "the research of ud was supported by a marie curie intra - european fellowship within the 6th european community framework programme and by the epsrc ( uk ) through the qip irc ( gr / s82176/01 ) and euroquam project ep / e041612/1 .",
    "it is not yet clear however , whether these seeds are sown before or after the transition .",
    "there is numerical evidence that in thermodynamic transitions the instant @xmath14 after the quench plays a dominant role @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in quantum phase transitions both instants play a similar role @xcite , so that the effective power laws that follow are a compromise ( usually  won \" by the steeper dependence ) .",
    "fortunately , when critical exponents are the same on both sides of the transition  as is the case in this paper  this distinction is of no importance .",
