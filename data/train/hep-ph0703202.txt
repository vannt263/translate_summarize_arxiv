    "higgs boson production in association with two jets has emerged as a promising channel for higgs boson discovery  @xcite and for the study of higgs boson properties  @xcite at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "interest has concentrated on vector - boson - fusion ( vbf ) , i.e. the weak process @xmath8 which is mediated by @xmath9 channel exchange of a @xmath2 or @xmath10 , with the higgs boson being radiated off this weak boson .",
    "the vbf production cross section measures the strength of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 couplings , which , at tree level , require a vacuum expectation value for the scalar field .",
    "hence the vbf channel is a sensitive probe of the higgs mechanism as the source of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "another prominent source of @xmath13 events are second order real emission corrections to the gluon fusion process .",
    "such corrections were first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the large top mass limit and have subsequently been evaluated for arbitrary quark masses in the loops which induce the effective coupling of the higgs boson to gluons  @xcite .",
    "some representative feynman graphs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmunu ] . in the @xmath14 limit ,",
    "also the nlo qcd corrections have recently been calculated  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : xs2 ]    at this level the signal rate is reduced by a factor of 3 as compared to the inclusive cuts , but the backgrounds now have cross sections of the same order as the signal .",
    "the largest background still arises from the @xmath15 processes , especially @xmath16 , i.e. one tagging jet arises from an ( unidentified ) @xmath17-quark from @xmath9 or @xmath18 decay and the other one is due to emission of a light quark or gluon in @xmath15 production . for an integrated luminosity of @xmath19",
    "the rates correspond to a purely statistical significance of the gluon fusion signal of @xmath20 .",
    "however , additional backgrounds arise from @xmath21 events where the missing transverse momentum is generated by detector effects .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that these backgrounds are under control when requiring a missing @xmath22 of at least 30 gev : @xmath23 the @xmath24 distributions are shown on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] . the gf signal and the backgrounds which we have considered are affected similarly by this cut .",
    "the resulting cross sections are shown in the last line of table  [ tab : xs ] .",
    "we are left with a signal to background ratio of one over @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath19 we expect 945 signal events on top of 3400 background events as summarized in table  [ tab : xs2 ] .",
    "this corresponds to a statistical significance of @xmath26 .",
    "note , however , that the top - production backgrounds need to be understood with an accuracy of 7% or better in the signal region in order to allow for a @xmath27 higgs signal from rate measurements alone .",
    "if background uncertainties turn out to be that large one may want to reexamine the selection . a significantly higher signal to background ratio , and a concomitant smaller effect of background uncertainties ,",
    "can be achieved by more aggressive cuts , as is obvious from the various distributions in figs .",
    "[ fig : rll ] to [ fig : mjl ] . in the absence of solid estimates for systematic errors",
    "we have tried to optimize the statistical significance and leave further refinements to future studies . in any case , the event rates summarized in table  [ tab : xs2 ] are sufficiently large to allow the analysis of distributions .",
    "normalized distributions for the minimum jet - lepton invariant mass .",
    "curves are for signal and backgrounds as in fig .",
    "[ fig : etajj ] with the inclusive cuts of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : incl ] ) . ]",
    "it is clear that a cut based analysis as described above is not the optimal way to isolate the signal from the background .",
    "more advanced techniques like neural networks or likelihood methods should be considered .",
    "as input for such refinements we show one further observable , which , however , could not be exploited in our cut based approach .",
    "the minimum jet - lepton transverse mass @xmath28 , i.e. the minimum of the four combinations of the charged leptons with the two tagging jets , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mjl ] .",
    "the distribution shows that @xmath28 is bounded by the top mass for the @xmath15 processes .",
    "only a small tail is left above @xmath29 for the @xmath30 process .",
    "this characteristic remains after the selection cuts .",
    "since the contribution from top backgrounds is so different for @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 gev , it might be useful to perform separate cut optimizations for the two regions .",
    "in order to determine the tensor structure of the effective @xmath7 coupling , the distributions of the two tagging jets are an important tool .",
    "the distribution @xmath33 of the azimuthal angle between the two tagging jets provides for an excellent distinction between the two tensor structures of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmunu ] )  @xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "when both cp - even and cp - odd couplings of similar strength are present , the tensor structure can not be unambiguously determined anymore . the missing information is contained in the sign of the azimuthal angle between the tagging jets  @xcite .",
    "naively one might assume that this sign can not be defined unambiguously in @xmath34 collisions because an azimuthal angle switches sign when viewed along the opposite beam direction .",
    "however , in doing so , the `` toward '' and the `` away '' tagging jets also switch place , i.e. one should take into account the correlation of the tagging jets with the two distinct beam directions . defining @xmath35 as the azimuthal angle of the `` away '' jet minus the azimuthal angle of the `` toward '' jet ,",
    "a switch of the two beam directions leaves the sign of @xmath35 intact .",
    "normalized distributions of the jet - jet azimuthal angle difference as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phijj ] ) .",
    "the curves are for the sm",

    "( [ eqn : incl ] ) and ( [ eqn : eta ] ) were applied . ]    to be precise , let us define the normalized four - momenta of the two proton beams as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the four momenta of the two tagging jets , where @xmath41 points into the same detector hemisphere as @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath43 provides the sign of @xmath35 .",
    "this definition is manifestly invariant under the interchange @xmath44 , i.e. when viewing the event from the opposite beam direction , and we also note that @xmath35 is a parity odd observable .    the corresponding azimuthal angle distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi1 ] for the gluon fusion higgs signal for three scenarios of cp - even and cp - odd higgs couplings .",
    "all three cases are well distinguishable .",

    "( [ eq : tmunu],[eq : a2a3 ] ) . for @xmath47",
    "the positions of the maxima are at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this also explains why @xmath50 loses information in the mixed cp case : when folding over the @xmath35-distribution at @xmath51 , maxima and minima at @xmath52 and @xmath53 degrees cancel each other .    as noted above , @xmath35 is a parity odd observable . finding a @xmath35 asymmetry as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi1 ] would show that parity is violated in the process @xmath54 .",
    "since the qcd couplings are parity conserving , the parity violation must originate from a parity - odd higgs coupling , namely @xmath46 in the effective @xmath7 vertex .",
    "this term is also cp - odd .",
    "such a coupling , occurring at the same time as the cp - even sm coupling @xmath45 , implies cp - violation in the higgs sector . in this sense , the observation of an asymmetry in the @xmath35 distribution would directly demonstrate cp - violation in the higgs sector .     the @xmath35 distribution for a pure cp - even coupling _ ( left ) _ and a pure cp - odd coupling _ ( right ) _ for @xmath55 . from top to bottom",

    "since the difference between the cp - even and the cp - odd case can also be expressed as a flip in the sign of @xmath63 ( keeping @xmath77 ) this result means that a cp - odd @xmath6 coupling can be distinguished from the sm case with approximately @xmath79 significance for 30  fb@xmath5 , assuming a perfect detector . since the backgrounds are fairly flat in @xmath35 , any background normalization uncertainties are largely absorbed into the fit parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "a quantitative determination of the de - correlation requires further study , however .",
    "both sources of higgs plus dijet events at the lhc , vector boson fusion and gluon fusion , can provide important information on higgs boson properties .",

    "taking into account the rapidity correlations of the tagging jets with the beam directions , the sign of this azimuthal angle can be defined  @xcite and the resulting full distribution in azimuthal angle separation @xmath35 exhibits the relative strength of cp - even and cp - odd couplings via a phase shift .",

    "gev with sm size production cross section in gluon fusion and sm - like decay branching fractions , a highly significant measurement is expected with an integrated luminosity well below 100  fb@xmath5 .",
    "a precise determination of the analyzing power requires a full detector simulation , however , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "the present analysis should be readily applicable , with minor modifications , like in the transverse mass cut of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mtww ] ) .",
    "lower higgs boson masses may require somewhat softer lepton @xmath22 cuts and will eventually run into statistical problems due to the smaller branching ratio for @xmath96 decay as compared to @xmath1  gev .",

    "this raises the question whether @xmath97 or @xmath98 signals from gluon fusion induced @xmath13 events are observable at the lhc .",
    "given the much more difficult task of qcd background reduction as compared to vector boson fusion studies which we have found in this paper for the `` easy '' @xmath1  gev case , we expect such novel higgs signals from gluon fusion induced @xmath13 events and the study of their azimuthal angle correlations to be quite challenging , but worth considering .",
