    "neutrinoless double - beta decay plays a key role in understanding the neutrino s absolute mass scale and particle - antiparticle nature  @xcite .",
    "if this nuclear decay process exists , one would observe a mono - energetic line originating from a material containing an isotope subject to this decay mode .",
    "one such isotope that may undergo this decay is @xmath2ge .",
    "germanium - diode detectors fabricated from material enriched in @xmath2ge have established the best half - life limits and the most restrictive constraints on the effective majorana mass for the neutrino  @xcite .",
    "one analysis  @xcite of the data in ref .",
    "@xcite claims evidence for the decay with a half - life of @xmath3 y. planned ge - based double beta decay experiments  @xcite will test this claim .",
    "eventually , these future experiments target a sensitivity of @xmath4 y or @xmath5 event / ton - year to explore mass values near that indicated by the atmospheric neutrino oscillation results .",
    "the key to these experiments lies in the ability to reduce intrinsic radioactive background to unprecedented levels and to adequately shield the detectors from external sources of radioactivity .",
    "previous experiments limiting backgrounds have been trace levels of natural decay chain isotopes within the detector and shielding components .",
    "the @xmath1-ray emissions from these isotopes can deposit energy in the ge detectors producing a continuum , which may overwhelm the potential neutrinoless double - beta - decay signal peak at 2039 kev .",
    "great progress has been made identifying the location and origin of this contamination , and future efforts will substantially reduce this contribution to the background .",
    "the background level goal of 1 event / ton - year , however , is an ambitious factor of @xmath6 400 improvement over the currently best achieved background level  @xcite .",
    "if the efforts to reduce the natural decay chain isotopes are successful , previously unimportant components of the background must be understood and eliminated .",
    "the potential for neutron reactions to be one of these background components is the focus of this paper .",
    "the work of mei and hime@xcite recognized that @xmath7 reactions will become important for ton - scale double - beta decay experiments .",
    "specifically , we have studied neutron reactions in pb and ge , materials that play important roles in the majorana  @xcite design .",
    "but since lead is used by numerous low - background experiments , the results will have wider utility .",
    "this paper presents measurements and simulations of pb@xmath0 ) and ge@xmath0 ) reactions and estimates the resulting background for ge - detector based , double - beta decay experiments for a given neutron flux . with these results ,",
    "we then use the neutron flux , energy spectrum , angular distribution , multiplicity and lateral distributions determined in  @xcite to estimate the background in ge detectors situated in underground laboratories . in section",
    "[ sec : meas ] we describe the experiments , the data , and the simulations . in sections",
    "[ sec : neutronflux ] and [ sec : anal ] we describe the analysis of these data .",
    "section  [ sec : anal ] also discusses the important pb@xmath0 ) production of @xmath1 rays at 2041 and 3062 kev .",
    "the former is dangerously near the 2039-kev q - value for zero - neutrino double - beta decay in @xmath2ge and the latter can produce a double - escape peak line at 2040 kev .",
    "these dangerous processes for ge - based double - beta decay experiments are discussed for the first time in this work .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] determines an overall background model for our detector and the implications of this model for future experimental designs .",
    "it also considers the relevant merits of cu versus pb as shielding materials , and the use of depth to mitigate these backgrounds is discussed .",
    "we also consider the possibility that the double - escape peak of the 3062-kev @xmath1 ray could contribute to the signal claimed in ref .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we collected five data sets to explore the implications of @xmath0 ) for double - beta decay experiments .",
    "all measurements were done in our basement laboratory at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "the laboratory building is at an atmospheric depth of 792 g/@xmath8 and provides about 1 mwe concrete ( 77 g/@xmath9 ) overburden against cosmic ray muons .",
    "three data sets were taken with a clover detector  @xcite .",
    "this detector is a set of 4 n - type , segmented germanium detectors .",
    "the four crystals have a total natural germanium mass of 3 kg and each crystal is segmented in half . the clover detector and its operation in our laboratory were described in ref .",
    "the remaining two measurements were done with a poptop detector  @xcite set up in coincidence with a nai detector .",
    "the poptop is a 71.8-mm long by 64-mm diameter p - type ge detector .",
    "taking into account the central bore , the detector is 215 @xmath10 or 1.14 kg .",
    "the nai crystal is 15.25-cm long by 15.25-cm diameter and is directly connected to a photo - tube .",
    "all data were read out using a pair of x ray instrumentation associates ( xia ) @xcite digital gamma finder four channel ( dgf4c ) camac modules .",
    "the camac crate is connected to the pci bus of a dell optiplex computer running windows 2000 .",
    "the system was controlled using the standard software supplied by xia .",
    "this data acquisition software runs in the igor pro environment @xcite and produces binary data files that were read in and analyzed using the root framework@xcite .",
    "the data sets include :    1 .",
    "a background run with the clover 2 .",
    "a th - wire source run with the clover 3 .",
    "an ambe source run with the clover using two different geometries of moderator 4 .",
    "an ambe source run with the poptop surrounded by lead 5 .",
    "an ambe source run with the poptop surrounded by copper    in this section we describe the experiments and the data collected .",
    "the clover was surrounded by 10 cm of lead shielding to reduce the signal from ambient radioactivity . underneath and above",
    "the lead was 5 cm of 30%-loaded borated polyethylene to reduce thermal neutrons .",
    "the background run done in this configuration lasted 27.13 live - days .",
    "the configuration for the th - source run was similar , but with some lead removed to expose the detector to the source .",
    "the th source run had a live time of 1337 seconds .",
    "the setup was modified somewhat from this background - run configuration for the measurements with the ambe source .",
    "[ fig : setup ] shows the configuration for one of the ambe measurements . for these data ,",
    "the clover was shielded on four sides with 10 cm of lead .",
    "the ambe source , 30 mci of @xmath11am with a calibrated neutron yield of @xmath6 63,000 hz ( @xmath120.7% ) , was on one side of the clover with 5 cm of lead and a layer of pure polyethylene moderator ( either 10 or 15 cm thick ) between the source and detector .",
    "the data acquisition system is inactive during data transfer .",
    "only the ambe runs had a large enough event rate for the dead time to be appreciable . a 6.13-h live - time data run ( 57% live )",
    "was taken with 15 cm of moderator , and another 3.57-h live - time data ( 38% live ) run was taken with 10 cm moderator ( pictured ) . for the analysis presented below , the data from these two configurations were combined , and thus the ambe - clover data set contains 9.7 h of live time .",
    "the observed energy spectrum extended from @xmath6 10 - 3100 kev for these data sets .    during the analysis of the ambe data",
    ", we observed a weak line at 3062 kev .",
    "this energy corresponds to a @xmath1-ray transition in @xmath13pb , and we therefore hypothesized that it was generated via pb@xmath0 ) .",
    "the double - escape - peak ( dep ) energy ( 2040 kev ) associated with this @xmath1 ray is very dangerous for @xmath2ge neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments because it falls so close to the transition energy ( 2039 kev ) .",
    "furthermore because the dep is a single - site energy deposition , it can not be distinguished from double - beta decay through event topology .",
    "this is in contrast to a full - energy @xmath1-ray peak , which tends to consist of several interactions and therefore is a multiple - site deposition .",
    "( see  @xcite for a discussion of the use of event topology to reduce background in ge detectors . )",
    "the final two measurements were intended to study this 3062-kev line in the spectrum and demonstrate its origin . in both cases",
    "a poptop ge detector faced a 15.25 cm by 15.25 cm nai detector for coincidence data . by sequentially placing a pb and then a cu absorber between an ambe source and a poptop ge detector , we tested the hypothesis that the line was due to neutron interactions in pb . by looking for an coincident energy deposit in the nai detector",
    ", we could be assured the ge detector signal originated from a neutron interaction in the sample .",
    "an energy deposit threshold in the nai of greater than 200 kev was required for a coincidence .",
    "the poptop was placed 27.3 cm from the nai detector with the source placed 20.3 cm ( 7 cm ) from the ge ( nai ) detector . for the lead study , 5 cm of lead was placed directly between the ge detector and the source .",
    "additional lead , in the form of 5-cm - thick bricks was positioned around the 4 sides of the ge detector to reduce room background . for the copper study ,",
    "a 0.5-cm thick cu tube was placed around the poptop and a 5-cm cu block was placed between the poptop and the source . for this final run ,",
    "all the lead was removed .",
    "for both of these sets of data , the observed spectra extended from @xmath6 125 kev to @xmath6 9 mev .",
    "for the poptop data , the pb and cu runs were of 19.12 h and 17.76 h live - time , respectively .",
    "the crystals were individually calibrated , and the resulting spectra summed together to form a single histogram .",
    "the peaks within each of the 3 clover data sets were identified and their intensities determined .",
    "if an event had 2 crystals that responded in coincidence , the histogram would have two entries .",
    "therefore the spectra we analyzed and simulated included all single - crystal energy deposits . by not eliminating events that registered signals in more than 1 of the clover ge detectors , we maximized the event rate .",
    "the peak strengths were estimated by fitting a gaussian shape to peaks and a flat background to the spectrum in the region near the peak .",
    "for the nuclear recoil lines , the peak shape was assumed to be a triangle and not gaussian . in table",
    "[ tab : lineid ] the uncertainties derive from this fit .",
    "a summary of the peak strengths is given in table  [ tab : lineid ] and the spectra themselves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyspectrum1 ] .",
    "the data sets were chosen to help decouple line blendings . because the rates in all peaks and continua are much higher for the source - induced data than for the background , features in those spectra are due to the sources and other contributions can be safely ignored .",
    "for example , the 2614.5-kev line can arise from either the decay of @xmath14tl or @xmath14pb@xmath7 . when exposed to a th source",
    ", tl decay dominates the spectrum , whereas when exposed to an ambe source , @xmath0 ) dominates .",
    "hence by normalizing the rate in this line to the rate in a pure neutron - induced transition ( _ e.g. _ the 596-kev @xmath15ge(n , n@xmath1 ) ) , we can determine the relative contribution of the two processes to the background spectrum .",
    "in fact , in the background data , both processes contribute to this line .",
    "some comments on our choices for line identification are in order . for an isotope such as @xmath16ge where a neutron capture leads to a stable nucleus , almost all ( n,@xmath1 ) lines",
    "could also be interpreted as @xmath0 ) lines in the resulting nucleus ; in this case @xmath17ge . for isotopes within the detector however , such as the 53.5-kev @xmath16ge(n,@xmath1 ) transition , the competing @xmath17ge@xmath0 )",
    "line would be a sum of this @xmath1-ray energy and the recoil nucleus energy . at these low energies where the recoil is a fair fraction of the @xmath1-ray energy , the @xmath0 )",
    "would simply contribute to the continuum and not be observed as a line . for the high energy cases ,",
    "the blend of a mono - energetic @xmath1-ray line and a @xmath0 ) process might be present .",
    "for the calibration runs , our threshold was approximately 70 kev .",
    "also note that we used a thorium wire as a calibration source . since the wire is pure natural th",
    ", we observe the th x rays in that data .",
    "in contrast , the background run shows lines from the thorium chain as a contaminant , therefore those lines are absent .    in all spectra , there are a few lines we have not identified .         + energy & process & + ( kev ) & & backgrnd & thorium & clover + & & ( per hr ) & ( hz ) & ambe ( hz ) +    *    continued * + energy & process & + ( kev ) & & backgrnd & thorium & clover + & & ( per hr ) & ( hz ) & ambe ( hz ) +     +    23.4 & @xmath18ge(n,@xmath1 ) & & & 1.017(5 ) + 46.5 & @xmath19pb & 112.75(42 ) & & + @xmath20 & @xmath21 & 61.01(31 ) & & 2.079(8 ) + 63.2 & @xmath22th & 93.02(38 ) & & + 67.7 & @xmath23th & 24.05(19 ) & & 0.591(4 ) + 68.8 & @xmath16ge(n,@xmath1 ) & & & 0.440(4 ) + 72.80 & pb x - ray & & 10.5(1 ) & 0.506(4 ) + 74.97 & pb x - ray & 663.5(1.0 ) & 34.1(2 ) & 1.703(7 ) + 76.7 & unidentified & & 29.0(2 ) & + @xmath24 & @xmath25 & 115.28(42 ) & 10.9(1 ) & 0.930(5 ) + @xmath26 & pb x - ray & 55.65(29 ) & 16.8(1 ) & 0.262(3 ) + 89.9 & th x - ray & & 32.4(2 ) & + 92.7 & @xmath22th & 171.38(51 ) & & 0.060(1 ) + 93.4 & th x - ray & & 47.5(2 ) & + 96.0 & @xmath27in(n,@xmath1 ) ? & & & 0.166(2 ) + 99.5 & @xmath28ac & 13.71(15 ) & 3.0(1 ) & + 105.3 & unidentified & 8.99(12 ) & & + @xmath29 & th x - ray & & 20.6(1 ) & + 108.7 & th x - ray & & 7.6(1 ) & + 109.9 & @xmath30f(@xmath31@xmath1 ) & 43.00(26 ) & & 0.506(4 ) + 129.1 & @xmath28ac & 12.91(14 ) & 3.2(1 ) & + 139.7 & @xmath15ge(n,@xmath1 ) & 47.20(27 ) & & 2.339(8 ) + 143.9 & @xmath23th & 20.03(18 ) & & + 154.0 & @xmath28ac & 7.69(11 ) & 1.5(1 ) & + 159.7 & @xmath32ge & & & 0.114(2 ) + 162.4 & @xmath27in(n,@xmath1 ) & 10.71(13 ) & & 1.073(6 ) + 174.9 & @xmath18ge(n,@xmath1 ) & 7.45(11 ) & & 0.763(5 ) + @xmath33 & @xmath34 & 114.60(42 ) & & 0.323(3 ) + @xmath35 & @xmath36 & 81.04(35 ) & & 2.328(8 ) + 199.2 & @xmath28ac & & 0.66(2 ) & + 202.6 & @xmath27in(n,@xmath1 ) & & & 0.061(1 ) + 209.5 & @xmath28ac & 19.38(17 ) & 10.9(1 ) & + 215.5 & @xmath28th & 2.43(6 ) & 0.92(3 ) & + 238.6 & @xmath37pb & 295.77(67 ) & 139.9(1 ) & 0.105(2 ) + 242.0 & @xmath38pb & 57.49(30 ) & 9.2(1 ) & + 247.1 & @xmath39(n,@xmath1 ) & & & 0.070(1 ) + 253.7 & @xmath40(n,@xmath1 ) & 2.76(7 ) & & 0.410(3 ) + 270.2 & @xmath28ac & 21.39(18 ) & 9.1(1 ) & + 273.0 & @xmath27in(n,@xmath1 ) & & & 0.055(1 ) + 277.4 & @xmath41 & 12.98(14 ) & 5.4(1 ) & 0.086(2 ) + 284.6 & unidentified & 2.79(7 ) & & + 288.1 & @xmath37bi ? & & 1.03(3 ) & + 295.2 & @xmath38pb & 58.02(30 ) & & + @xmath42 & @xmath43 & & & 0.068(1 ) + 300.1 & @xmath37pb & 18.59(17 ) & 9.7(1 ) & + 306.2 & @xmath18ge(n,@xmath1 ) & 1.12(4 ) & & 0.046(1 ) + 321.4 & @xmath28ac & & 0.67(2 ) & + 326.0 & @xmath44ge(@xmath31@xmath1 ) & & & 0.487(4 ) + 328.3 & @xmath28ac & 10.02(12 ) & 8.2(1 ) & + 332.9 & @xmath28ac & & 1.14(3 ) & + 335.5 & @xmath27in(n,@xmath1 ) & & & 0.028(1 ) + 338.7 & @xmath28ac & 45.13(26 ) & 31.5(2 ) & + 351.9 & @xmath38pb & 95.11(38 ) & & + 354.1 & unidentified & & & 0.043(1 ) + 385.1 & @xmath27in(n,@xmath1 ) & & & 0.048(1 ) + 391.3 & @xmath18ge(n,@xmath1 ) & & & 0.053(1 ) + 409.8 & @xmath28ac & 4.05(8 ) &",

    "a simulation of the neutron flux with neutron energies up to a few gev expected at 3200 mwe deep due to cosmic - ray @xmath99 interactions in the surrounding rock and 30-cm lead shield and the resulting response of the clover to the flux of @xmath1 rays arising from this flux .",
    "this simulation permits us to estimate rates in detectors situated in underground laboratories .",
    "the first two of these simulations are to verify the code s predictive power .",
    "the third is to aid in understanding the utility of depth to avoid neutron - induced backgrounds .",
    "the simulation package geant3-gcalor  @xcite is described in detail in ref .",

    ", @xmath100 reactions leave the target nucleus in a highly excited state which subsequently decays via a @xmath1-ray cascade to the ground state . in the simulation ,",
    "inelastic scattering cross sections for excitation to a given level depends on the properties of the ground and excited states .",
    "these cross sections were calculated using in - house - written code based on hauser - feshbach  @xcite theory modified by moldauer  @xcite .",
    "the validation of the hauser - feshbach theory has been the subject of several studies  @xcite .",
    "the simulated @xmath1-ray flux arises from the relaxation of the initial excited - state distribution , which includes a large number of levels ( 60 states for @xmath14pb@xmath0 ) reactions , for example ) .",
    "the nuclear levels and their decay channels were provided by the ensdf@xcite database through the geant package .",
    "note however , that the simulation did not predict every possible transition .",
    "in particular the important 2041-kev and 3062-kev emissions from pb were not part of this simulation .",
    "this situation arises because the simulation packages only have @xmath100 cross sections for the lowest lying excited states for most nuclei .",

    "the details of this simulation are described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we study the effectiveness of the simulation to predict spectra resulting from ( n , n@xmath1 ) .",
    "the simulation was done by generating neutrons with the appropriate energy spectrum outside the lead shield and propagating them through the shield including secondary interactions that may add to the neutron flux and alter the energy spectrum .",
    "[ fig : back ] shows a comparison between the data and the simulations for the clover background run and ambe run .",
    "note only neutrons as primary particles were simulated for this comparison and the dominant difference between the two spectra is due to the room s natural radioactivity and non - neutron @xmath99-induced processes .",
    "here we excluded those processes from the simulation to emphasize the spectral shape , including lines , that are a direct result of neutron interactions .",
    "the similarity of the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] indicates that the measured background spectrum is dominated by neutron - induced reactions .",
    "the uncertainty in the simulation is calculated by comparing the well known peaks in table  [ tab : simulatedlines ] which shows a comparison of the simulation to the line production for both background and ambe runs .",
    "the measured neutron produced lines are within about 5% of the predicted values from simulation , as is the continuum rate in the ambe data . therefore the ( n , n@xmath1 ) rates are well - simulated for nuclear states with well - defined cross sections .",
    "( the continuum for the background data includes processes that were not simulated and hence is not a good measure of the uncertainty . )",
    "because the neutron flux estimates come from these line strengths ( see section  [ sec : neutronflux ] ) , the uncertainty in the flux cancels in these estimates . the uncertainty in the measured neutron flux and spectrum underground(@xmath635% ) constrains the precision to which such simulations can be verified and is well described in ref .",
    "this 35% uncertainty due to the flux is much larger than the uncertainty for the @xmath1-ray line production described above .",
    "therefore , a total uncertainty of 35% is used for all predictions of line rates underground throughout this paper .",
    "in this section , we use the data to determine the neutron fluxes we observed during our various experimental configurations .",
    "we then compare our measured cosmic - ray induced flux with that predicted from past measurements and our simulation .",
    "spectral lines that indicate neutron interactions in natural ge detectors have been studied previously .",
    "see references  @xcite , for example .",
    "in particular , the _ sawtooth_-shaped peaks due to @xmath101 at 693 kev and 596 kev respectively are clear indications of neutrons and have been used to deduce neutron fluxes  @xcite . operating ge detectors in a low - background configuration , these lines can be used to help interpret the background components .",
    "recent double - beta decay experiments  @xcite have constructed their detectors from ge enriched in isotope 76 . although an appreciable amount of @xmath15ge remained ( 14% ) , @xmath102ge are depleted . for such detectors , only lines originating in isotopes 74 and 76 are useful for neutron interaction analysis .",
    "as these experiments reach for lower background , neutron - induced backgrounds become a greater concern and the diagnostic tools more important .",
    "neutrons from ( @xmath103,n ) and fission reactions have an energy spectrum with an average energy similar to the ambe spectrum used in this study .",
    "furthermore , the average energy of the ambe neutrons is similar to that of the neutrons within the hadronic cosmic - ray flux impinging on our surface laboratory although the latter extend to much higher energies .",
    "therefore the ge - detector signatures indicating the presence of neutrons described above will be similar to those arising from neutrons originating from the rock walls of an underground laboratory .",
    "however , low - background experiments that use ge detectors are typically deep underground and are shielded from environmental radioactivity by a thick shield .",
    "this shield , typically made of pb , is then usually surrounded by a neutron moderator .",
    "this configuration is effective at greatly reducing the neutron flux originating from ( @xmath103,n ) and fission reactions in the cavity walls of the underground laboratory .",
    "in contrast , although neutrons originating from @xmath99 interactions underground are much rarer , they have much higher energy .",
    "therefore these @xmath99-induced neutrons can penetrate the shield more readily and become a major fraction of the neutrons impinging on the detector .",
    "the estimate of the flux of neutrons with energies greater than 692 kev is given by  @xcite @xmath104 where i is the counts s@xmath105 under the asymmetric 692-kev peak , v is the volume of the detector in @xmath10 ( 566 @xmath106 ) and k is a parameter found by ref .",
    "@xcite to be 900 @xmath12 150 cm . for the 15-cm moderator data ,",
    "this formula predicts a neutron flux of 2.3/(@xmath9 s ) whereas our simulation , using the known flux of the source , predicts 1.8/(@xmath9 s ) .",
    "this difference ( 20 - 30% ) is somewhat greater than the 17% uncertainty claimed by ref .",
    "the geometry for our measurement was complicated and perhaps this added complexity of neutron propagation contributes to the difference .",
    "for the uncertainty associated with the flux of neutrons produced from cosmic ray @xmath99 , we use the 35% value as it is much larger than the value associated with eqn .",
    "[ eq : flux1 ] .    for the am - be neutron source ,",

    "this rate is an average over the two moderator configurations .",
    "the neutron flux during the 10-cm moderator run is estimated to be about a factor 2.3 larger than for the 15-cm moderator run .",
    "for the poptop - ambe run on pb for the raw data ( in coincidence with the nai detector ) , the effective flux was 8.6 @xmath12 2.6/(@xmath8 s ) ( 0.26 @xmath12 0.08 /(@xmath8 s ) ) .      in the background spectrum",

    "the uncertainties in table [ tab : speciallines ] are estimates based on a minor contribution of the statistical uncertainty in the peak strengths and a major contribution resulting from the @xmath6 35% uncertainty in the neutron flux determination as described in section [ sec : neutronflux ] .",

    "one has to consider the existence of a dep line at the double - beta decay endpoint a serious design consideration for ge - detector experiments . from the above analysis ,",
    "the dangerous lines at 2041 and 3062 kev due to pb@xmath0 ) are not significant contributors to the spectrum of ref .",
    "however , as future efforts reduce the natural activity irradiating the detectors , these pb - neutron interactions will become important .",
    "one solution could be the use of cu as a shield instead of pb .",
    "copper is rather expensive and building the entire shield of this material is probably not necessary .",
    "a thick inner liner of cu might suffice , but if a peak is observed and pb is present near the detector , arguments based on the spectrum near 3062 kev will be critical .",
    "although the problematic lines we observed in the pb data were absent in our cu data , the shields were too dissimilar to make a quantitative comparison regarding the effectiveness of reducing the continuum background .",
    "furthermore , our experience with the lead and the simulation of @xmath0 ) spectra reduces confidence in the conclusion regarding the cu in the absence of such data .",
    "we are preparing better experimental studies to address this question .",
    "as double - beta decay experiments become more sensitive , the potential background must be constrained to ever - lower levels .",
    "much progress has been made in reducing naturally - occurring radioactive isotopes from materials from which the detector is constructed .",
    "as these isotopes that have traditionally limited the experimental sensitivity are eliminated , rarer processes will become the dominant contributors .",
    "here we have considered neutron - induced processes and have quantified them .",
    "reactions involving neutrons can result in a wide variety of contributions to the background .",
    "that is , no single component is likely to dominate .",
    "therefore , tell - tale signatures for neutrons are needed and were identified in this work .",
    "in addition to the general continuum background that neutrons might produce , two specific dangerous pb@xmath0 ) lines were identified .",
    "these two backgrounds can be significantly reduced using depth and/or an inner layer of cu within the shield .",
    "in particular , the 3062-kev transition in @xmath13pb has a double escape peak at the endpoint energy for double - beta decay in @xmath2ge .",
    "a comparison of past double - beta decay data indicates the rate of this transition is too small to explain a claim of double - beta decay .",
