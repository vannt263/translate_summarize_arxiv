    "the study of far infrared ( fir ) emission from the relatively denser regions of the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) is useful for understanding the star formation process .",
    "high spatial resolution mapping of galactic molecular clouds in the fir continuum ( in @xmath11 2 bands ) provides direct information about the physical conditions ( e.g. total luminosity , dust distribution , dust temperature etc . ) of the region . for a constant gas - to - dust ratio , the dust optical depth traces matter along the line of sight",
    ". a comparison of the dust temperature distribution with that of the gas temperature ( obtained from molecular line measurements ) can give important information on the dust - gas coupling in star forming regions .",
    "for medium to high mass embedded ysos , dust is the dominant source of heating of the gas ( outside the region ) . a fir study of an individual star formation complex ( at a known distance ) can measure the luminosity function above a threshold which can usually be translated to the present day mass function and even initial mass function .",
    "systematic differences can be expected between star forming regions at different galactocentric distances , since the star formation process depends on the physical conditions of the local ism ( e.g. density , composition , radiation field etc . ) .",
    "this important issue has been addressed by many authors using various techniques .",
    "systematic studies in radio continuum and molecular line emission based on colour selected samples from the iras point source catalog ( hereafter iras psc ) have led to very useful databases which can be the starting point for further studies ( wood & churchwell @xcite ; wouterloot & brand @xcite ) .",
    "although the iras mission has proved to be a corner stone in improving our understanding of star formation in the galaxy , its sub - optimal angular resolution in the 60 and 100 @xmath1 m bands has been a major limitation .",
    "in addition , recent iso measurements of nearby spiral galaxies have shown the importance of emission at wavelengths @xmath12 100 @xmath1 m and colder dust ( t @xmath3 25 k ) seems to be a dominant constituent of spiral galaxies in general ( alton et al .",
    "this suggests a similar role for colder dust in our galaxy also .    in view of the above , the tifr 1-metre balloon borne telescope",
    "is flown regularly to map galactic star forming regions simultaneously in two fir bands with near diffraction limited angular resolution .",
    "these fir bands have been chosen to be trans - iras ( @xmath0 = 148   &  209 @xmath1 m ) , so that the distribution of interstellar dust cooler than @xmath13 30 k which might have been missed by iras , can be traced ( ghosh @xcite , mookerjea et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "accessibility of more than 90 % of the galactic plane ( @xmath14 = 315@xmath15  0@xmath15  290@xmath15 ) from the indian balloon launching station has been exploited by targeting the southern sky , which is observationally less explored in the fir .",
    "the catalogue of co emission associated with colour selected iras psc sources by wouterloot & brand ( @xcite ; hereafter wb89 ) covers the longitude range of the galactic plane of interest to us .",
    "based on information from this catalogue , the star forming complex around iras 09002 - 4732 was selected for the present study because : ( i ) all the four bright iras psc sources in this region have similar kinematic distances ( wb89 ; sugitani & ogura @xcite ) ; three of them ( iras 08589 - 4714 , 09002 - 4732 and 09014 - 4736 ) are known to be physically associated , hence this complex presents an opportunity to derive its pdmf / imf if a reasonable number of sources are detected ; ( ii ) it lies marginally outside the solar circle ,",
    "hence a comparison of the physical conditions in this region with that in the 45 kpc molecular region and regions inside the solar circle would be interesting ; ( iii ) the complex is very close to the galactic mid plane with @xmath16 pc ( wb89 ) as compared to the scale height of 90 pc for the embedded ob stars ( wood & churchwell @xcite ) .",
    "this region around iras 09002 - 4732 is associated with the very extended vela molecular ridge detected in the wide angle survey of @xmath17co emission by may et al .",

    "( @xcite ) in both @xmath17co and @xmath18co lines .",
    "most of the available observational data for this region pertain to iras 09002 - 4732 itself and clearly indicate the presence of an embedded young stellar object in a dense molecular cloud .",
    "these include measurements of radio continuum ( caswell & haynes @xcite ; manchester & goss @xcite ; whiteoak @xcite ; walsh et al .",
    "@xcite ) , infrared spectra from the iras low resolution spectrometer catalog ( hereafter lrs ; olnon & raimond , @xcite ) , iso long wavelength spectrometer data ( iso - lws ; clegg et al .",

    "@xcite ) and molecular line detection of cs have been reported ( zinchenko et al .",
    "a recent multi transitional study of iras 09002 - 4732 has led to the detection of bipolar outflow emission in the cs line with distinct red and blue shifted peaks displaced symmetrically relative to the central ir object ( lapinov et al .",

    "the observations of a large region ( area @xmath12 500 sq .",

    "this galactic region / molecular cloud complex has been studied with the aim of understanding the energetics , physical sizes , spatial distribution of interstellar dust and its temperature .",
    "the next section describes the observations and the results alongwith the discussions are presented in section 3 .",
    "the galactic star forming region associated with iras 09002 - 4732 was mapped using a new 12 channel two band far infrared ( fir ) photometer system at the cassegrain focus of the tifr 100 cm ( f/8 ) balloon borne telescope .",
    "details of the 100 cm telescope system and the observational procedure have been described elsewhere ( ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite ; mookerjea et al .",
    "this 12 channel photometer was flown for the first time on 18 november , 1993 from the tifr balloon facility , hyderabad ( latitude = 1747 n , longitude = 7857 e ) .",
    "a pair of six element ( 2 @xmath19 3 close packed configuration ) composite silicon bolometer arrays was used as fir detectors and were cooled to 0.3 k using a closed cycle @xmath20he refrigerator ( verma et al .",
    "the same region of the sky was viewed simultaneously in two fir bands with near identical fields of view of 16 per bolometer , thus instantaneously covering an area of 60 @xmath19 34 in each band .",
    "a series of filters and a csi beam splitter define the two fir wavebands .",
    "the spectral transmission of the total system in each fir band was determined in the laboratory using a michelson interferometer and a golay cell as the reference detector .",
    "the resulting transmission curves for the two bands are shown in fig .",
    "since the configuration of the cryogenically cooled filters which define the fir pass bands , have been upgraded from time to time , these bands differ from those in mookerjea et al .",

    "detection of several additional pah features ( cohen et al .",
    "@xcite ; de muizon et al .",

    "although iras 09014 - 4736 is classified as an unidentified source in the iras psc , it is situated within @xmath13 20  of the small optical nebula , bbw 225 ( size @xmath3 2  ) , identified by brand et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the embedded yso ( b1 ) inferred from our modelling is consistent with all of the above .",
    "however , the actual geometry of the source has to be far from spherically symmetric , in order to reconcile with the size of the optical nebula and the near infrared data .",
    "similar conclusions have been arrived at by beck et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for iras 09014 - 4736 .",
    "the only available molecular line observation from this source is the co emission ( wb89 ) .",

    "a constant density cloud with dl type dust grains is implied .",
    "the total radial @xmath5 = 0.05 and the model cloud mass is 55 @xmath6 . since the energizing stellar source is detectable in the near - ir , this is an example of very evolved stage of star formation , where only a small fraction of the original interstellar matter is left around the star at present .",
    "the source iras 08589 - 4714 has been detected in co and cs surveys by wouterloot & brand ( @xcite ) and bronfman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) respectively .",
    "whereas our model gives a value for the @xmath27 ratio to be @xmath13 44 @xmath10 , the virial mass of the cloud estimated from the co data of wb89 indicates a value of 3.7 @xmath10 .",
    "iras 08583 - 4719 is contained in the catalog of bright rimmed clouds which are candidates for star formation by radiation driven implosion ( sugitani & ogura @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately no additional observational data pertaining to a sed are available other than those presented here .",
    "the physical size estimate has been taken from sugitani & ogura ( @xcite ) .",
    "once again a constant density dust ( dl ) cloud gives the best fit to the sed ( fig .",

    "the parameters for this model are listed in table 3 .",
    "the mass of the model cloud is 50 @xmath6 leading to a @xmath26 ratio of 80 @xmath10 .",
    "the dl type of dust is favoured for all the four sources modelled here .",
    "it may be noted that the emissivity index in the 100  200 @xmath1 m range for dl type dust ( for both silicate and graphite ) , is @xmath13 -2 , consistent with our choice for generation of t(148/209 ) maps ( sect .",
    "three of these four sources suggest a constant density dust envelopes around the ysos .",
    "this conclusion seems to be very common for several galactic star forming regions : e.g. for iras 18314 - 0720 , 18355 - 0532 and 18316 - 0602 ( mookerjea & ghosh , @xcite ) ; iras 00338 + 6312 , 04004 - 5114 and rafgl 5111 ( mookerjea et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; iras 00494 + 5617 and 05327 - 0457 ( mookerjea et al .",
    "the following comments can be made by comparing the parameters for the four sources modelled here : the dust cloud corresponding to iras 09002 - 4732 has the largest size of the central cavity , which contains the most luminous embedded source . except iras 09014 - 4736 , for all other three sources , the regions extend well into the respective dust clouds .",
    "this emphasizes the role of dust grains on the emission of recombination lines and radio continuum .",
    "the radial optical depth due to the dust ranges between 0.02 to 0.05 which is slightly on the lower side compared to iras 00494 + 5617 ( mookerjea",
    "@xcite ) , 00338 + 6312 ( mookerjea et al .",
    "the interstellar dust composition is found to be nearly identical in all the four sources modelled , viz . , silicate dominated .",
    "the ratio between the graphite and the silicate grains , in general vary drastically among the galactic star forming regions ( mookerjea et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , nearly identical dust composition found here further supports the hypothesis that the entire complex around iras 09002 - 4732 mapped by us is physically associated .",
    "the @xmath27 ratio for the four sources studied here , as found from our radiative transfer modelling , falls in a narrow range of 44  81 @xmath10 . for three of these for which co measurements are available ,",
    "this ratio based on virial masses , fall in somewhat broader range ( 3.7  58 @xmath10 ) .",
    "these can be compared with the results from other studies : ( i ) a study similar to the present one , for the w 31 complex has lead to a value of @xmath26 in the range of 1.6  3.6 @xmath10 ( ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( ii ) the average value for a large sample of clouds using virial mass based on co measurements , is @xmath2 4 @xmath10 with a spread exceeding a factor of 100 ( mooney & solomon @xcite , evans @xcite ) ; ( iii ) for denser cores studied in cs emission ( plume et al .",

    "considering the uncertainties arising due to the fact that the different tracers are sampling different components of the ism ( at possibly different spatial scales ) , the star forming complex associated with iras 09002 - 4732 can be termed as typical of the galaxy .",
    "the galactic star forming region associated with the iras source 09002 - 4732 and its neighbouring region ( @xmath13 0.15 sq .",

    "a total of 15 sources have been detected including 4 iras psc sources .",
    "several of these are well resolved in both these bands .",
    "diffuse emission contributes 35 % of the total fir emission at 209 @xmath1 m .",
    "taking advantage of simultaneous observations using identical beams in these two bands , reliable maps of dust colour temperature [ t(148/209 ) ] and optical depth ( @xmath4 ) have been generated which show many structures . under reasonable assumptions ,",
    "the imf slope for this region has been found to be @xmath7 for the mass range of 416 @xmath6 .",
    "the hires processed iras survey data for the same region at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath1 m have also been used for comparison as well as extracting discrete sources positionally matching with those detected at 148 and 209 @xmath1 m .",
    "the spatial distribution of t(60/100 ) and @xmath5 have also been generated for the region locally around iras 09002 - 4732 for comparison .",

    "the observed infrared sub - mm sed , angular sizes and the radio continuum data have been used to constrain the parameters of the models .",

    "<S> the galactic star forming region in the southern sky , associated with iras 09002 - 4732 has been mapped simultaneously in two far infrared bands ( @xmath0 = 148 & 209 @xmath1 m ) , with @xmath2 1  angular resolution . </S>",
    "<S> fifteen sources , including iras 08583 - 4719 , 08589 - 4714 , 09002 - 4732 and 09014 - 4736 have been detected , some of which are well resolved . taking advantage of similar beams in the two bands , a reliable dust temperature [ t(148/209 ) ] </S>",
    "<S> map has been obtained , which detects colder dust ( @xmath3 30 k ) in this region . </S>",
    "<S> the hires processed iras maps at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath1 m , have also been used for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the optical depth maps , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , generated from these far - ir data quantify the spatial distribution of the dust . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse emission from this entire region has been found to be 35 % of the total fir luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the imf in the mass range 416 @xmath6 has been estimated to be @xmath7 for this star forming complex .    </S>",
    "<S> radiative transfer models in spherical geometry have been explored to fit available observations of the 4 iras sources and extract various physical parameters for corresponding dust - gas clouds . whereas a constant ( @xmath8 ) radial density distribution is favoured in iras 08583 - 4719 , 08589 - 4714 and 09002 - 4732 , the @xmath9 law is inferred for iras 09014 - 4736 . </S>",
    "<S> the dust composition is found to be similar ( silicate dominated ) in all the four iras sources modelled . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity per unit mass is found to be in the narrow range of 44  81 @xmath10 for these star forming regions . </S>"
