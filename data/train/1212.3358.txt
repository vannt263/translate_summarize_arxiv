    "note however that importantly , this does not depend on the temperature .",

    "noting that the thermal force is unchanged by feedback , and assuming that the feedback noise is negligible , the phase noise of the feedback driven resonator is obtained by deriving the above analysis with replacing @xmath97 by @xmath147 , which leads to : @xmath148&=&\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{fb}}}{\\omega^2}.\\label{eq:2 - 1 - 11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thereby , positive dissipative strong feedback ( @xmath149 ) enables considerable reduction of the phase noise of the resonator .",
    "while this result is somehow similar to the situation of an externally driven resonator as we will see in the next section , the phase noise decrease is limited to the stability of the external reference , while feedback is self - referenced .",
    "the experimental performance of the feedback technique will therefore mostly rely on the ability to design a low - noise feedback circuit .",

    "[ eq : stab - free - running ] shows that the stability increases with mechanical quality factor , gate time , and frequency : therefore , besides being of high interest for purposes such as mass sensing @xcite , high - frequency , high - q mechanical resonators are extremely useful for absolute stability applications such as time and frequency control @xcite .      as suggested by the very similar mathematical expression of the phase noise in the free - running and feedback driven configurations , the expression of the thermal limited frequency stability in the latter case takes the same form as eq .",
    "[ eq : stab - free - running ] : @xmath177 with @xmath178 the effective mechanical quality factor .",

    "this expression identifies to the one we derived in the next paragraph in the case of an externally driven oscillator at short gate times ( @xmath182 ) , with the important difference that it applies at all gate times ( in the limit @xmath183 ) .",
    "again , the important difference with external driving is that this stability is no longer limited to the one of the external reference , which is found to be routinely on the order of a few @xmath184 at second - scale for quartz oscillators . reaching higher stability that become comparable to atomic clocks ( i.e. below @xmath185 )",
    "will therefore rather require the use of positive dissipative feedback .      in the limit of a coherent drive @xmath186 , frequency stability of an externally driven resonator at thermal equilibrium",

    "this is probably a technical legacy : mems technology first provided high - q low - frequency oscillators , with very long mechanical coherence times @xmath189 , easily on the order of a few tens of seconds , along which technical limitations ( e.g. thermal drifts , pressure fluctuations etc ... ) are the prominent sources of frequency noise .",
    "however , the recent development of high - frequency nems has led to low - noise , fast decay rate oscillators , the former truncation being henceforth obsolete .",
    "we thereby compute the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : general ] without further assumption , and find : @xmath190    eq.[eq : stability - thermal ] shows that the apparent frequency stability depends of the inverse ratio between the coherent drive and the thermal variance , along the thermal equivalent phase noise dependance .",

    ", one sees that a high @xmath194 is favorable to lower measurement imprecision , along the usual optimization discussions .",
    "as already mentioned above , we also note that this asymptotic expression is identical to the effective frequency stability previously determined in the case of the feedback driven resonator , with @xmath195 being replaced by @xmath196 , the use of feedback being though preferable as explained before .    on the other hand , for long gate times , eq.[eq : stability - thermal ] leads to @xmath197 : the thermally - limited allan variance no longer depends on the mechanical quality factor , and decreases with the square power of @xmath36 and with the fourth power of the mechanical resonance frequency .",
    "this @xmath198 convergence behavior can be understood since averaging over gate - time greater than @xmath199 means that two consecutive averaged realizations of the frequency measurement are independent due to the random nature of thermal noise , in contrast to the short gate - time case where these two measurements are related via the mechanical coherence time .",

    "<S> the slow fluctuations are significantly reduced in presence of stabilization , with the noise suppression even exceeding @xmath37 at the second scale . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved long - term stability is further compared to the theoretical limits of our system . for a self - sustained mechanical resonator </S>",
    "<S> , the thermo - mechanically limited allan variance @xmath38 can be shown to be given by ( see supplementary section s2.2 ) :    @xmath39    the data of figure 3(d ) were acquired in presence of a self - sustained displacement @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> this analysis shows that our stabilization scheme enables reducing external frequency noise close to the thermal limit , but not closer than a factor of @xmath4 ( that is @xmath41 in power ) , which disagrees with the spectral data of figure 3(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by a reduced sensitivity of noise detection : mode @xmath4 being externally driven , the expression of its thermal limited allan deviation differs from mode @xmath3 and is described by ( see supplementary section 2.2 ) : @xmath42 with @xmath43 , the noise detection imprecision @xmath44 is comparable to @xmath45 ( eq . [ eq : stab - allan ] ) , and therefore has to be taken into account when determining the stabilization limit , which is given by :    @xmath46    the thermal limit for mode @xmath4 @xmath47 as well as the overall stabilization limit given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : lim - total ] are represented in figure 3(d ) , showing very good agreement with the experimental data up to gate times in the @xmath48 range . on longer timescales , the frequency fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> are stabilized to a flat level in the @xmath49 range , which we attribute to insufficient gain .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we analyze the frequency stability and its improvement with the stabilization scheme by using a third independent method based on a recent proposal @xcite . briefly , this method is based on the simultaneous measurement of both in - phase and out - of - phase quadratures @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the coherently driven mechanical motion . </S>",
    "<S> these quadratures are used to reconstruct the complex motion trajectory @xmath52 whose moments @xmath53 can be shown to be insensitive to thermal noise , enabling the extraction and quantitative study of external frequency noise . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the presence of external frequency fluctuations @xmath54 is revealed by an anomaly of the ratio @xmath55 , which falls below unity by an amount proportional to the frequency noise power . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the quadratures of the coherently driven motion write as the sum of a steady and a fluctuating part @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> a straight forward expansion gives @xmath57 . with the thermal contribution to the quadrature fluctuations @xmath58 being uncorrelated and with identical variances </S>",
    "<S> , the previous expression becomes @xmath59 , with @xmath60 denoting the quadratures fluctuations due to the presence of external frequency noise . </S>",
    "<S> for a resonantly driven system , the in - phase quadrature @xmath61 is maximum , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 is thus reduced to the quantity @xmath64 . at the mechanical resonance frequency , @xmath65 gives a direct access to the frequency noise power , with no calibration being required . in a more sophisticated approach @xcite , it can be shown that for a weak gaussian frequency noise , the ratio @xmath66 $ ] varies along the driving frequency as    @xmath67&=&1-\\frac{s_{\\omega\\omega}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{m}}+2i\\omega},\\label{eq : dykmanrig}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath68 denoting the frequency noise spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the experimental determination of @xmath66 $ ] we performed with our system , both in the non - stabilized ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) ) and in the stabilized cases ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c , d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) show the realizations of the phase - space trajectory used to determined @xmath69 $ ] in the non - stabilized and stabilized configurations respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> as expected , without stabilization we obtain a discernible dip around the mechanical resonance frequency as shown in figure 4(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dip depth is about @xmath70\\simeq4\\times10^{-2}$ ] with the deviations from the expected shape resulting from long - term frequency drifts that change @xmath71 . following eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : dykmanrig ] such a dip is expected to correspond to a frequency noise @xmath72 , that is about @xmath73 above the thermal limit @xmath74=\\frac{\\omega^2}{4\\pi^2}s_{\\mathrm{\\phi\\phi},1}[\\omega]\\simeq(41\\,\\mathrm{mhz}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{hz}})^2 $ ] , in very good agreement with the results presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the stabilization is switched on , the dip is greatly reduced to a level of @xmath70\\simeq6\\times10^{-4}$ ] , corresponding to a residual noise @xmath75 that is @xmath76 above the expected thermal limit . </S>",
    "<S> this value confirms the origin of this remaining imprecision as resulting from squashing , which is expected to generate the very same noise excess as explained above .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed and implemented a scheme allowing a non - invasive stabilization of a mechanical mode . </S>",
    "<S> this technique proves to be remarkably efficient , as shown by the almost perfect noise cancellation for the lowest order out - of - plane mode of a high - q nanomechanical resonator operated just below its nonlinear threshold , which places our system close to the optimum noise limit at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our method is very general and can be readily applied to a number of ultra - sensitive nanomechanical systems : first , our scheme allows using any mechanical mode for detection of frequency noise and we successfully demonstrated noise cancellation using the third - order out - of - plane mode . to apply an error signal one needs a dc restoring force , which is widely available either via photothermal forces in optomechanical systems such as in our work or as electrostatic forces in electrical systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , our scheme fully preserves the detection capabilities of the stabilized system , which we have experimentally verified by showing efficient radiation - pressure induced thermomechanical squeezing @xcite of the fundamental out - of - plane mode @xcite that was impossible to observe without stabilization due to long - term frequency drifts .    </S>",
