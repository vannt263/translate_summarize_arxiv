    "the number , type and spatial distribution of satellite systems surrounding host galaxies can serve as a unique probe to theories of galaxy formation . in a @xmath4cdm universe , host galaxies such as the milky way ( mw ) are predicted to reside in vast dark matter halos . in this paradigm",
    ", the main galaxy is expected to be surrounded by numerous satellite dark matter halos that lie within a few 100 kpc of the central galaxy .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that many of these halos host luminous dwarf galaxies .",
    "such satellite systems are potentially ideal dynamical tracers of the underlying mass distribution and can also probe the effect of environment on morphology , star formation , and quenching . despite the theoretical utility of a well - sampled satellite system ,",
    "most observations find only a handful of satellites per massive host outside the local group ( lg ) .    a limiting factor in establishing robust samples of satellites beyond the lg is the inherent faintness of these objects .",
    "to circumvent this , some have taken a statistical approach , stacking large numbers of similar systems and inspecting aggregate properties @xcite . however , stacking in this manner makes it impossible to study variation between systems , and thereby restricts the inferences that can be drawn .",
    "for example , recent observations of the mw and m31 satellite systems have found them to be preferentially aligned in extended disks @xcite .",
    "such results are impossible to replicate in studies that stack galaxies and requires detailed knowledge of particular isolated hosts with large numbers of satellites to verify the global significance .    in this light ,",
    "one recent study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k11 ) focuses on the mw - like , barred spiral galaxy ngc 4258 ( also known as m106 ) to identify a large sample of satellite galaxies . k11",
    "use megacam on the canada france hawaii telescope to observe a 1.7 by 2.0 degree field around ngc 4258 ( roughly out to a projected radius of 130 kpc ) and find 16 candidate satellite galaxies and 5 probable candidate satellite galaxies .",
    "these were selected based on the existence of literature radial velocities , resolvable stars , and/or extended and faint surface brightness structure .",
    "this catalog of 21 galaxies spans a wide range of morphologies , from dsph , de , sd , to irr .",
    "most of them have surface brightness profiles that are fit well by an exponential and have negligible color gradients .",
    "additionally ngc 4258 satellites follow the schechter luminosity function with a faint - end slope of -1.19@xmath5 , which is steeper than the lg slope ( -1.06@xmath60.03 ) but flatter than the m81 slope ( -1.29@xmath7 ) .",
    "we revisit this work by spectroscopically observing a subset of the 16 satellite galaxies identified in the k11 sample to determine the prevalence of foreground / background galaxy contamination .",
    "we expand the k11 survey to include additional galaxies detected in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that are also spatially near ngc 4258 .",
    "ngc 4258 is similar to the milky way in that it has a terminal rotational velocity of 208 km s@xmath8",
    "@xcite , is a barred spiral galaxy , and has an average b - band surface brightness of 23.1 @xcite . due to its relatively nearby location ( 7.6  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and interesting inner disk morphology ( resolved agn and warped accretion disk , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has been the source of a wide array of galactic studies .",
    "significantly , ngc 4258 possesses a water maser , which tightly constrains the distance to it with an error of only @xmath9@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "other distance measurements made with cepheid variables and tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) magnitudes have reasonable agreement @xcite .    aside from assessing the significance of foreground / background contamination in a photometrically derived satellite sample",
    ", we see three primary motivations to extend the k11 study of the ngc 4258 satellite system .",
    "one , using a jeans equations based technique developed by @xcite , we can draw constraints on the total mass of ngc 4258 .",
    "two , we can assess if there is a preferential orientation for the satellites surrounding ngc 4258 , as has been found for the mw @xcite , m31 @xcite , and m81 @xcite three , it has long been known that the color and morphology of mw and m31 satellites vary as a function of distance from respective hosts ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , it has yet to be established if this apparent environmental effect holds outside the lg . given its relative isolation from other massive perturbers and numerous candidate satellites , ngc 4258 provides an ideal testbed of the significance of proximity to the host galaxy to color and morphology of satellites .",
    "for these reasons , we build upon k11 s work to assemble and leverage the most complete list of satellite galaxies surrounding a mw - like system outside the lg .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 details our data collection / reduction process , including the target selection , observations , data processing , and velocity measurements .",
    "section 3 provides a discussion of how we categorize the satellites and calculate the host mass . in the same section we present a discussion of the angular distribution and color range of the satellites .",
    "section 4 contains concluding remarks .",
    "we combine the k11 catalog of 16 potential satellites with additional candidates drawn from the sdss database to produce a list of targets for spectroscopic followup . to select potential targets from sdss , we searched within 2 degrees ( projected radius @xmath11 kpc ) of ngc 4258 and required that the r - band petrosian radius be larger than 5  and the photometric redshift be less than 0.1 .",
    "minor color cuts were applied to ensure targets had galaxy - like colors .",
    "this list was sorted by r - band brightness , and then targets were manually inspected to remove any objects that were artifacts of sdss such as shredded galaxies or bright star halos .",
    "satellites were then ranked based on r - band magnitude , projected distance of the satellite away from the host , and photometric redshift , using the following formula : score = @xmath12 .",
    "the 30 highest scoring galaxies as well as the k11 satellites served as the basis for our observations . due to limited observing time",
    "we did not obtain spectra for all of these objects .",
    "see figure  [ name ] for galaxy distribution in right ascension and declination relative to ngc 4258 and table [ data ] for relevant properties from sdss and nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we used five half - nights of observing time on the 3.5-meter apache point observatory ( apo ) telescope with the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) to observe 29 targets .",
    "the wavelength was centered on 6799   for the red channel and 4502   for the blue , with each channel covering about @xmath91180  .",
    "the high resolution 1200 lines / mm grating was used with a slit width of 2  .",
    "observations were made in february , april , and may of 2011 .",
    "exposure times ranged from 5 to 20 minutes .",
    "ten bias frames were averaged and subtracted from all images .",
    "nightly quartz lamp dome flats were normalized by a 9th , 10th or 11th order polynomial and divided out of the science images .",
    "arc lamp helium - neon - argon spectra were taken after slewing to a new target to correct for any small distortions in the mirror and instrument while the telescope was in motion .",
    "arc lamp frames were used to wavelength calibrate the corresponding science spectra .",
    "standard star observations taken at the beginning and/or end of each night .",
    "these flux standards were used to eliminate the instrument response signature in the spectra .",
    "typical seeing was 1.6 \" , and the standards were observed at low airmass .",
    "the background was subtracted by using regions off - target but along the slit .",
    "spectra were corrected to the heliocentric rest frame and were combined when repeat observations were made on the same night .",
    "spectra from the red and blue channels were reduced with the same method .",
    "completely reduced spectra have a scale of 0.58  / pixel for the red channel and span a wavelength range of @xmath96210 to 7390  ; the scale for the blue channel is .61  / pixel , spanning a range of @xmath93870 to 5130  . see figure [ specs ] for a sample of reduced spectra .",
    "objects observed with apo are listed in table [ data ] along with the j2000 right ascension , declination , sdss r - band magnitude , measured heliocentric radial velocity , and literature distances .",
    "galaxies will hereafter be referred to by last three ( or four ) digits of their sdss dr7 object i d . for",
    "a full sdss i d refer to table [ data ] .",
    "depending on the size of the target galaxy , we extract between 1 and 20 spectra along the spatial dimension . for each extracted spectrum ,",
    "we use penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) @xcite and gas and absorption line fitting ( gandalf ) @xcite algorithms to fit stellar velocities and emission line velocities in both the red and blue spectra . for stellar templates ,",
    "we use the single stellar population galaxy models from @xcite . for galaxies that were spatially extended , we fit rotation curves to the measured velocities to find the dynamical centers of the systems and systemic velocities .",
    "the red emission lines ( @xmath13 , [ sii ] ) are usually the brightest features .",
    "the red spectra are also better calibrated since we only have @xmath95 arc - lines in the blue .",
    "we therefore adopt the red emission line velocity , or if it is not available , the blue stellar velocity as the systematic velocities of our galaxies .",
    "since many of these galaxies are spatially extended , we expect the primary source of error to be due to imperfect placement of the spectrograph slit .",
    "given the high signal in most of our spectra , we expect velocity errors of order 10 km s@xmath8 .",
    "formally , the errors could be smaller , but we expect systematic errors ( slit - placement , kinematic vs photometric center , etc . ) will limit us as well .",
    "we assume the maximum in the stellar continuum corresponds to the dynamical center of each galaxy .",
    "our velocities agree with the available sdss values within the root mean square scatter of 10 km s@xmath8  in all but three cases .",
    "two of the galaxies ( sdss ids 911 and 621 ) have bright off - center star forming regions which were targeted by sdss .",
    "the last galaxy ( 782 ) remains discrepant ; despite being a relatively bright object , none of the measurements ( ours , sdss , or ned ) agree particularly well .",
    "our velocity for ngc 4258 also agrees with literature values . to derive this",
    ", we carefully extracted the spectrum from a small central region , as ngc 4258 has a very sharply rising rotation curve which can skew the result if the extraction is not symmetric .",
    "below we present three findings that were made with the combined sdss and apo data .",
    "the first section describes how we categorize galaxies as probable and possible satellites versus background galaxies .",
    "the second section explains our mass calculation of ngc 4258 .",
    "the third section examines the angular distribution of satellites , and the fourth section discusses the color of our satellite galaxies .    from this point forward , any mention of a velocity refers to the velocity relative to ngc 4258 .",
    "the relative velocity is defined as the line of sight velocity of that galaxy minus the line of sight velocity of ngc 4258 .",
    "a histogram of all these relative velocities is shown in figure [ histogram ] as a red line .",
    "it is immediately apparent from this figure that there are many more galaxies that are redshifted with respect to ngc 4258 than blueshifted . by symmetry",
    ", we expect a similar number of true satellite galaxies to be redshifted as blueshifted @xcite .",
    "in addition there is a peak around 300 km s@xmath8 indicating that there might be some other structure just beyond ngc 4258 . for these reasons",
    ", we conclude that there is significant contamination from background galaxies in our sample .",
    "before we can perform any analysis on our sample of galaxies or on the host itself , we must discard non - members .      in order for a dwarf to be considered a satellite",
    "it must be bound to the host galaxy .",
    "that is , it must have a total velocity less than the escape velocity of the system _ and _ have a distance similar to that of the host @xcite . to determine which of our dwarf galaxies could satisfy the first requirement , we plot the line of sight velocity with respect to the host against the projected radius ( figure [ vvsr ] ) .",
    "next , we calculate the escape velocity as a function of radius for three different mass distributions : a point mass , an nfw profile @xcite , and a burkert profile @xcite .",
    "disk components are included for the latter two profiles .",
    "the nfw profile is described by @xmath14 and the burkert profile is described by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is density scale , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the core radius for an nfw profile , which is of the order 10 kpc .",
    "we iterate on @xmath16 and @xmath18 in our analysis .",
    "the disk surface density that we employ is @xmath19 where the mass of the disk , @xmath20 , is 6@xmath010@xmath21m@xmath2 and the scale radius of the disk , @xmath22 , is 2.6  kpc . importantly , since we only know 1-d velocities ( radial velocities ) of our galaxies , we assume they obey velocity isotropy ; it then follows that the 3-d velocity of a satellite is @xmath23 . ] . in this limit",
    ", we can compare our line of sight velocities with the escape velocities predicted for each profile by dividing the profiles by @xmath24 .",
    "we have over plotted @xmath25 for the three profiles in figure  [ vvsr ] .",
    "next , we determine the best fit parameters to these profiles . as a first guess we use the parameters for the milky way as defined by @xcite .",
    "because the nfw and burkert models yield nearly identical results , we opt to use the nfw profile for further analysis rather than both models . to further refine the density models we need to know additional information about the system .",
    "if there was a selection of galaxies with reliable distance measurements that match ngc 4258 and have velocities within a reasonable range , we can conclude that such galaxies must be bound to the system and leverage them to constrain the halo parameters .",
    "this is the case for two of our 47 galaxies ( 996 and 207 ) , which have tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) distances within the errors of the distance to ngc 4258 @xcite .",
    "more importantly , they are located near the edge of the nfw escape velocity profile and can be used to create lower limit boundaries for the profile .",
    "we increase @xmath16 and @xmath18 so that these two satellites fall within the nfw escape velocity profile .",
    "thus we assume density and radius values for the nfw model of @xmath16=1.4@xmath010@xmath26 m@xmath2/kpc@xmath27 and @xmath18=16  kpc .",
    "we now use our best - fit lower limit nfw profile to determine further satellite membership . any galaxy that has",
    "a line of sight velocity that falls within the nfw @xmath28 lines in figure  [ vvsr ] is a strong candidate for being a satellite galaxy ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for possible confusion at large projected radii ) .",
    "eight galaxies fall within the @xmath29 boundaries and have projected radii of less than @xmath30 kpc ; they are deemed the most probable satellites , and are tagged with a",
    " y \" for yes in our catalog .",
    "galaxies that fall within the @xmath28 boundaries but have projected radii of greater than @xmath30 kpc , are tagged with a  m \" for maybe .",
    "next we relax our initial assumption about velocity isotropy and consider the case when most of the total velocity is along the line of sight ] ; a system is bound in this scenario if the line of sight velocity is simply less than the total escape velocity .",
    "this is a possible but not probable scenario .",
    "hence , we categorize galaxies with a line of sight velocity greater than @xmath31 but less than @xmath32 as possible satellites , and tag them with an  m \" for maybe as well .",
    "17 galaxies fall beyond the total escape velocity profile .",
    "we categorize them as non - members , and tag them in our catalog with an  n \" for no .",
    "the remaining 14 galaxies lack velocity information . at this time",
    ", we draw no conclusion about their membership . these galaxies are indicated in table [ data ] with an  x \" for excluded .",
    "they are not included in our subsequent analysis but would be strong candidates for further follow - up .",
    "we consider the steps outlined above a good first pass at determining membership .",
    "however , distance estimates to these objects can help us refine our individual classifications .",
    "the literature contains distance measurements for 13 of our 47 galaxies .",
    "here we amend a few of our previous y / m / n / x categorizations on the basis of these values , as outlined below .",
    "recall ngc 4258 is 7.6 mpc away .",
    "galaxy 850 was initially classified as  m ; \" however , its average distance in ned is 15.7 mpc from tully fisher and surface brightness fluctuation measurements ; due to the large separation in distance , it is reclassified as a `` n '' for background galaxy .",
    "galaxies 909 , 042 , and 206 have average tully fisher distances in ned of 17.9 , 14.4 , and 21.05 mpc respectively ; again , they are reclassified as  n. \" another galaxy we reclassify is 782 , which has a single tully fisher distance in ned of 21.2 mpc ; we demoted from  y \" to  n. \" finally , galaxy 911 has a trgb distance of 5.63 mpc in ned .",
    "it was originally a  y \" but is demoted to ",
    "n \" as it is a foreground galaxy .",
    "any galaxies unmentioned retain the same membership classifications as before .",
    "these final classifications are listed in table  [ data ] .",
    "we add one additional galaxy to our list from archival hst data analyzed by l. macri and f. munshi ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "they present the trgb distance to galaxy 358 .",
    "we categorize it as an  m \" galaxy since the distance is similar to the host galaxy , but refrain from a higher ranking because we do not have a velocity measurement .",
    "additionally , macri and mushi also provide a trgb distance for 207 that is consistent with ngc 4258 .",
    "it should be noted that seven of the galaxies we considered ( 067 , 207 , 4639 , 422 , 970 , 678 , 012 ) are listed with distances of 7.8 mpc in @xcite _ based upon k11 s photometric work_. 7.8 mpc is the distance to ngc 4258 found from cepheid measurements of @xcite .",
    "we do not list these distances in table [ data ] because , as we demonstrate here , membership based on photometry alone is uncertain .",
    "when taking into consideration the available velocities and distances , we conclude that 4 of the objects classified by k11 are probable satellites ( 072 , 207 , 277 , 996 ) , 2 are possible satellites ( 593 , 634 ) , 3 are not satellites ( 782 , 850 , 909 ) , and 7 are still uncertain ( 012 , 067 , 422 , 678 , 828 , 970 , 4639 ) .",
    "we note that 072 , also known as ngc 4248 , has long been considered a satellite galaxy @xcite .",
    "see table [ data ] for mapping between k11 i d and sdss i d , as well as figure [ name ] .",
    "we conclude that 8 of the galaxies we consider have the highest probability of being satellites .",
    "this represents 17% of our sample .",
    "a dwarf galaxy survey done by @xcite found only 78 out of their 409 target galaxies within four clusters were actually members , equating to a 19% yield .",
    "since the surface density of galaxy clusters is much larger than that of field galaxies , we consider the results of the @xcite survey as an upper limit for how well we expect to be able to select system members .",
    "however , we caution that without knowing both velocities and distances , it is impossible to state with absolute certainty whether a galaxy is a satellite , and it is still quite possible that some of our most probable sample are in fact non - members .    to summarize , we adopt the following classification scheme :    * probable satellites ( `` y '' ) : galaxies with distance measurements consistent with ngc 4258 or no known distances ; line of sight velocity within @xmath31 and have projected radii less than 200 kpc . * possible satellites ( `` m '' ) : galaxies with distance measurements consistent with ngc 4258 or no known distances ; line of sight velocity greater than @xmath31 but smaller than @xmath33 , or line of sight velocity within @xmath31 but with projected radii greater than or equal to 200 kpc but less than 300 kpc .",
    "* unknown if satellites ( `` x '' ) : galaxies with distance measurements consistent with ngc 4258 or no known distances ; galaxies with no known line of sight velocities ; projected radii less than 300 kpc . * not satellites ( `` n '' ) : galaxies with distance measurements inconsistent with ngc 4258 or velocities outside @xmath32 .    based upon on these criteria , we categorize 8 objects as probable satellite galaxies , 8 as possible satellite galaxies , and 17 as non - members ; for 14 galaxies we draw no conclusion .      with this collection of probable satellite galaxies , we next aim to estimate the dynamical mass of ngc 4258 .",
    "@xcite publishes a set of robust mass estimators for cases where only the projected radius and line of sight velocity of each target are known ( as opposed to true radii and peculiar velocities ) .",
    "they assume the population of satellites is spherically symmetric .",
    "the relevant equations are : @xmath34    @xmath35 . \\label{eq27}\\ ] ]    where m is the galaxy mass , g is the gravitational constant , @xmath36 is a fiducial radius at which the power - law approximation for the relative potential is valid , @xmath37 is the binney anisotropy parameter that depends on the tangential and radial velocity dispersions , @xmath38 is the power law index of the radial density distribution of satellites , r@xmath39 is the upper limit of a gravitational field that is scale - free , and @xmath40 is the gamma function , where @xmath41 .",

    ", we find the mass of the host to be 3.1@xmath60.7@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 out to a radius of 200 kpc . including the 8 probable satellites plus the 3 possible satellites that fall within @xmath43 but have projected radii greater than 200 kpc , we find the mass of the host to be 3.7@xmath61.0@xmath010@xmath1  m@xmath2 out to 240 kpc .",

    "kpc is 1.8@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 .",
    "any uncertainty here is due to the fact that we have 1-d velocities and projected radii .",
    "several studies of the mw , m31 , and m81 have found that satellites exist in a plane centered around the host @xcite .",
    "k11 find their sample of 16 satellites are preferentially aligned along the disk of ngc 4258 .",
    "we reassess these findings based on our revised satellite list .",
    "a rigorous evaluation would consider both a satellite s angle and projected distance away from the disk before drawing conclusions about the angular dependence .",
    "however , the disk of ngc 4258 is highly inclined relative to our line of sight ; this minimizes the impact of projection effects , which could cause a satellite elevated above the disk to instead appear aligned with the disk . because of this we only consider the angular separation between a satellite and the disk plane .",
    "we use a position angle of 150@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "figure [ angle ] displays the cumulative angular distribution of three subsets of satellites .",
    "the blue solid line traces the probable satellites ; the dashed green line traces the probable plus possible satellites ; and the red dash - dotted line traces the original k11 satellites .",
    "data has been folded from 360 degrees to 90 degrees to allow for better statistical sampling .",
    "an angle of 0 degrees indicates a satellite galaxy is perfectly aligned with the disk of the host ( i.e. major axis alignment ) ; an angle of 90 indicates a galaxy is not at all aligned with the disk and might instead be aligned with the minor axis of the host . in figure",

    "overplotted on figure [ angle ] are the one sigma envelopes for random distributions drawn from samples of eight and 16 satellites , shown in blue and red respectively .",
    "our probable sample has 8 satellites ; the probable plus possible sample and the k11 sample both have 16 satellites . all three distributions grow faster than the random distribution ; however both the probable and probable plus possible samples fall ( marginally ) within the envelopes of what is allowed by a random distribution .    for completeness",
    ", we have used the idl routine @xmath45 to run a one - sample komolgorov - smirnov ( ks ) test on the data to quantitatively assess if the angular distributions of probable satellites , possible plus probable satellites , and k11 satellites are drawn from a random distribution .",
    "however , we caution that the ks test requires a relatively large number of data points to properly reject the null hypothesis ( that the sample is drawn from a random uniform distribution ) .",
    "the ks statistic ( @xmath46 ) specifies the maximum deviation between the data and a supplied distribution ; @xmath46 varies between 0 and 1 .",
    "larger @xmath46 values indicate that the data and supplied distribution are significantly different .",
    "the significance level ( @xmath47-value ) of the ks statistic is also considered ; the @xmath47-value is the probability of drawing from a random distribution and obtaining results as extreme or more extreme than the data .",
    "@xmath48-values vary from 0 to 1 ; a large @xmath47-value indicates that it is highly likely that one will generate samples like the data .",
    "we make two comparisons to a flat distribution , where a satellite is equally likely to be at any angular position : we consider our catalogs of probable satellites , and probable plus possible satellites .",
    "the ks statistics for these are @xmath46=0.24 and 0.18 with significance levels of @xmath47=0.66 and 0.63 respectively .",
    "since the @xmath46 numbers are small and @xmath47-values are large , this means with a high confidence level , our samples of probable and probable plus possible satellites are drawn from a flat distribution .    ever since holmberg initially found satellite galaxies",
    "are preferentially aligned along the minor axis of their host @xcite , there have been a steady stream of conflicting results regarding satellite galaxy alignments ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "besides numerous observational disagreements , there is also no broad theoretical agreement on whether satellites should be aligned at all or found on randomly oriented orbits @xcite .",
    "there are two standard interpretations of satellites existing in a disk ; either they recently merged as an infalling group , or they tend to fall along cold dark matter filaments @xcite . on the other hand , a lack of any orientation could imply that the host galaxy has not accreted any new dwarfs in recent cosmic times .",
    "while our findings very loosely support the latter hypothesis , we feel that we have too few satellites to draw definitive conclusions .",
    "there may even be an alternative interpretation when taking satellite colors into consideration ( see section [ satellite morphology ] ) .",
    "figures [ yes ] and [ maybe ] display the sdss images of our probable and possible satellites respectively . from these images , is immediately apparent that the vast majority of these satellites are blue irregulars .",
    "we plot further in figure [ color ] a map of the sloan @xmath3 colors of the satellites as they appear on the sky .",
    "colors less than 2.2 are blue , late - type galaxies .",
    "all but two of our probable satellites have @xmath3 colors less than 1.7 .",
    "the remaining two have colors less than 2.15 . adding to that , all of the possible satellite galaxies have @xmath3 colors less than 1.6 .",
    "given our technique for identifying the line of sight velocity of these galaxies , this is not surprising ( that is , our catalog is not complete , as the method is biased against red , dim satellites ) .",
    "what is surprising is the sheer number of blue satellites ; if this system was like the mw or m31 , we would expect many fewer blue star forming satellites at small projected radii .    to further stress this point , we replicate a color - magnitude plot from @xcite shown in figure [ bvcolor ] .",
    "color transformations from @xcite are used to move from g and r to b and v. galaxies that fall below the black line are blue late - type galaxies ; galaxies above the black line are red early - type galaxies .",
    "many of our probable and possible galaxies that have small projected radii are found below the line .",
    "it is conventionally thought that galaxies experience quenching as they fall inward toward the host ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "since our satellites are blue star - formers they most likely have not had enough time to be quenched . as mentioned in the previous section",
    ", this might imply that they have recently been accreted to the system .",
    "again , we are not making an argument for completeness here because we are only sensitive to the brightest satellites and therefore miss dimmer dwarf spheroidals .",
    "however , even in an incomplete sample we find a large number of blue , late - type galaxies .",
    "our results are consistent with the photometric work of @xcite for ngc 7331 .",
    "as we have demonstrated , satellite membership is challenging to determine .",
    "it can not be done from photometry alone , nor spectroscopy alone , but instead requires , at minimum , a combination of the two . with photometry",
    ", one can make a good first guess as to which galaxies might be satellites based on resolvability of stars and surface brightness as was done by k11 .",
    "spectroscopy can help narrow that sample , as we have shown here . to further refine the selection ,",
    "distance measurements are needed . finally , to verify a galaxy as a satellite with absolute certainty would require orbital radius and proper motions . without these , it is impossible to confidently declare satellite membership .",
    "while our sample of satellites does take velocities and distances into consideration , we caution that it might still contain non - members in the foreground and background .",
    "since small number statistics are in play for these sorts of systems , it only takes a couple non - member galaxies to produce misleading conclusions about the characteristics of the sample as a whole .",
    "this is why we choose four categorizations for our satellites : probable , possible , non - member , and unknown .",
    "we do not refer to any of the satellites as confirmed .    despite our cautionary language",
    ", we can not emphasize enough that our sample has much better constraints than a purely photometrically derived ground - based satellite catalog .",
    "that is , while it is not complete and perhaps suffers some minimal degree of contamination , it is certainly the most reliable catalog of ngc 4258 satellites to date .",
    "we present a spectroscopic catalog of 47 dwarf galaxies surrounding ngc 4258 .",
    "fifteen of these targets did not previously have published redshifts .",
    "a histogram of line of sight velocities of potential satellite galaxies indicates that a substantial fraction are background galaxies ; without proper motions ( or realistically , distances to the galaxies ) there is no easy way to determine which are bound to ngc 4258 and which are background contaminants .",
    "using an nfw profile to eliminate any obvious interlopers , we classify 8 of our dwarf galaxies as probable satellites and 8 as possible satellites .",
    "our selection criteria are based upon distance measurements and velocities . with this sample of satellite galaxies ,",
    "we make four conclusions :    \\(1 ) the mass yielded when using the 8 probable satellite galaxies in a mass estimator based on the spherical jeans equation is 3.1@xmath60.7@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 out to a radius of 200 kpc . if we instead integrate our nfw profile , we find the mass to be 1.8@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 out to 200 kpc .",
    "\\(2 ) the orientation of the probable and possible plus probable galaxy subsets do not indicate a strong preferential alignment with the disk .",
    "\\(3 ) a large number of the probable satellites are blue irregulars , which is atypical in comparison to the mw and m31 systems .",
    "\\(4 ) satellite membership is difficult to identify when only photometry is utilized .",
    "we conclude that velocity and distance measures are necessary to determine satellite membership with any certainty .",
