    "an important way to characterize quantum dots ( qds),@xcite the simplest artificial nano - structure with electrons quantized in all three dimensions , is by the parametric evolution of their properties .",
    "the most common external parameter is magnetic field because of its flexibility of tuning,@xcite but other parameters are also used .",
    "here we are concerned with the effect of changing the electron number @xmath0 or the external gate voltage @xmath1 , referred to as the _ scrambling _ and _ gate _ effects , respectively , in coulomb blockade ( cb ) experiments .",
    "@xcite the most striking feature of the cb regime is sharp peaks in the conductance through the quantum dot as a function of gate voltage . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , at each conductance peak , the number of electrons residing in the dot changes by one ; across a peak spacing , the gate voltage changes to bring another electron into the dot , and deforms the confining potential in the meantime .",
    "the scrambling and gate - induced shape deformation effects were both introduced@xcite in connection with experiments on the spacing between cb conductance peaks,@xcite and have also been used to interpret cb peak height correlations.@xcite    the scrambling and gate effects can both be quantified through the variation in the single - particle spectrum of the system , @xmath2 . since electron - electron interactions are important for quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime , one must clearly consider the effect of such interactions on the single - particle spectrum . here",
    "we evaluate the scrambling and gate effects using both density functional theory and thomas - fermi calculations for realistic geometries of quantum dots .",
    "we address two main issues :    first , while the magnitude of the scrambling and gate effects has been estimated for hard - wall quantum dots coupled to a large gate ( one which deforms the entire dot),@xcite experimental quantum dots have , of course , smooth confining potentials , and are typically deformed with a narrow `` plunger '' gate .",
    "we evaluate these experimental features using our realistic model of quantum dots , showing that they influence the magnitude of the scrambling and gate effects strongly .",
    "second , what `` single - particle spectrum '' should one use in evaluating the scrambling and gate effects ?",
    "roughly there are two types of single - particle spectra that can be defined in an interacting system .",
    "the first is a spectrum from a self - consistent mean field theory such as hartree - fock ( hf)@xcite or kohn - sham spin - density functional theory ( ks - sdft).@xcite the second is the spectrum of a reference hamiltonian which contains the interactions only at a smooth ( classical - like ) level .",
    "the most natural choice is the eigen - spectrum of the effective potential calculated from thomas - fermi ( tf ) theory ; this constitutes the strutinsky approach ( s - tf).@xcite the difference between these two types of spectra is familiar , for instance , from discussions of the meaning of the eigenvalues in the self - consistent approach : recall that the self - consistent eigenvalue is related to the energy for removing an electron from that level and that a sum over such eigenvalues double counts the interaction energy among those electrons,@xcite neither of which is true for the eigen - spectrum in the reference hamiltonian approach .",
    "( color online ) illustration of scrambling and gate effects in coulomb blockade conductance fluctuations .",
    ", width=192 ]    the meaning and magnitude of the scrambling and gate effects depend on which type of single - particle spectrum is used .",
    "we emphasize that this is _ not _ a question of which approach is the more accurate , but rather of what part of the fluctuations of the total energy is assigned to these effects .",
    "for instance , when using a reference potential as in s - tf , the fluctuations as a parameter changes associated with interactions are separated into two distinct parts .",
    "the first comes from changes in the single - particle energies as the smooth thomas - fermi potential varies  we consider these the `` genuine '' scrambling and gate effects .",
    "the second contribution involves the screened coulomb interaction between mesoscopic density fluctuations .",
    "this `` residual interaction '' term corresponds to the weak interaction between landau quasi - particles in a fermi liquid picture . in a self - consistent approach such as ks - sdft , they appear in the self - consistent energies @xmath3 ; thus parametric evolution of the ks levels involves both genuine scrambling and residual interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as followings . in the next section ,",
    "we outline briefly the two theoretical approaches , i.e. the kohn - sham method and fermi - liquid like strutinsky approximation scheme . in section iii , we describe the 2d realistic quantum dot model used for the study the scrambling and gate effects .",
    "the main results of this study are presented and analyzed in section iv .",
    "in both the ks - sdft and s - tf approaches , for a system with @xmath0 electrons and total spin @xmath4 , one solves a schrdinger equation with a spin - dependent potential , @xmath5 @xmath6 ) + u_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\sigma } ( { \\mathbf{r}};[n^{\\alpha    } , n^{\\beta } ] )          \\label{eq : vks}\\ ] ] where the total potential is the sum of the external , hartree , and exchange - correlation contributions , and @xmath7 denotes spin - up and down , respectively . in ks - sdft,@xcite one",
    "knows that the potentials are functionals of the spin densities @xmath8 , which are solved self - consistently under the constraint @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "exact _ exchange - correlation potential is used.@xcite this association provides a physical meaning to the self - consisent eigenvalues which can be contrasted with that of the reference hamiltonian eigenvalues .    in the s - tf approach , the basic idea is to start from a smooth semiclassical approximation , i.e. the thomas - fermi theory , and introduce quantum interference by considering , first , single - particle corrections and , then , the effect of screened interactions between the oscillating part of the electron density . in this case",

    "we evaluate the scrambling and gate effects in both ks and s - tf approaches . for the s - tf case",

    "the spin indices will therefore be dropped in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the numerical methods that are used to solve ks and tf equations are described in details in refs .",
    ", respectively .",

    "[ fig : sigma](b ) is particularly striking when compared to the sharply different magnitudes for the scrambling effect in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma](a ) .",
    "the underlying reason for this difference between the gate and scrambling effects is the extra electron added in the case of scrambling : first , the contribution to the fluctuations of @xmath75 by most of the residual interactions is small because of the small change in wave functions caused by the additional potential .",
    "second , the contribution by residual interactions involving the added electron @xmath76 are , however , much larger : the fluctuations here involve the deviation of @xmath77 from the smooth density rather than the small change in an already filled level .",
    "thus the fluctuation of the residual interaction contribution to @xmath75 is substantially stronger in the case of scrambling than for the gate effect .",
    "we now turn to actual spacings between cb conductance peaks and calculate the scrambling and gate effects .",
    "the position for the @xmath78 peak , @xmath79 , at which the energies for @xmath80 and @xmath0 electrons are equal , is determined by @xmath81 if chemical potentials in the leads are taken to be zero . from the tf spectrum at this @xmath82 , the scrambling and gate effects are the standard deviation of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively . for @xmath61",
    "nm , the former is equal to @xmath85 , and the latter @xmath86 , using the same confining gate shapes and parameter ranges as above . note the good agreement with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] for @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "comparison with earlier evaluations of these effects yields important insights .",
    "we start with the scrambling effect ; in particular , using the expressions derived in refs .   for scrambling associated with the thomas - fermi spectrum  which we think of as the `` genuine''scrambling effect",
    " yields @xmath89 for a dot with @xmath51 electrons .",
    "this prediction is six times larger than the value obtained here .",
    "there are two main differences between the earlier situation and ours : the confining potential here is smooth while it was assumed to be hard - wall in refs .  , and we effectively have a top gate across the whole dot because of our boundary condition .",
    "the insensitivity of the scrambling magnitude to the spacing @xmath22 suggests that the top gate has little effect .",
    "_ we therefore conclude that there is significantly less scrambling in a smooth confining potential than in a hard wall dot_.    further support for this conclusion comes from the change in potential upon adding an electron : the hard - wall gives rise to a square - root singularity in this quantity;@xcite the absence of a singularity in the smooth case naturally leads to a weaker effect . as a consequence , the scrambling in the ks spectra , which contains both genuine scrambling and some residual interaction fluctuations [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilons ] ) ] , appears to be entirely dominated by the latter .",
    "evaluating the magnitude of these residual interaction fluctuations as an extra electron is added , following the semiclassical random plane wave approach in refs .  , gives @xmath90 for @xmath51 .",
    "taking into account that one is not very far into the semiclassical regime , this is quite compatible with the value @xmath91 computed for the kohn - sham spectra [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma](a ) ] .    for diffusive transport in a weak disordered potential",
    ", scrambling has been studied using the statistics of single - particle wavefunctions in that case.@xcite in that context , scrambling grows linearly with @xmath57 while residual interaction effects grow as @xmath92 .",
    "it is interesting to note that our data in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma](a ) for a ballistic dot show roughly the same behavior .    with regard to the gate effect",
    ", it was argued that a `` generic '' gate should have the same effect as tf scrambling @xcite . for the gate considered here ,",
    "we however observe a significant difference .",
    "a `` generic '' gate is one which couples approximately uniformly to the dot  a back gate , for instance .",
    "the opposite extreme is a gate coupled very locally to a point in the dot , thus producing a rank one perturbation .",
    "such perturbations are known to completely decorrelate the spectra for the phase shift @xmath93 necessary to add an extra electron.@xcite here we see that lateral plunger gates are an intermediate case : they produce fluctuations which are significantly stronger than the scrambling effect but remain moderate on the scale of the mean level spacing .",
    "the gate effect here is nevertheless strong enough to produce spin transitions .",
    "recently kogan , et al .",
    "reported experimentally a singlet - triplet transition in zero magnetic field driven by changing the confining potential.@xcite in our calculations , we also observe spin transitions caused by gate - induced shape deformation .",
    "the probability of a transition  the fraction of peak spacings in which the ground state spin flips as @xmath29 changes  is @xmath94 for @xmath95 @xmath96  nm and @xmath97 for @xmath95 @xmath55  nm .",
    "in addition to the simple singlet - triplet transition , different patterns appeared in our calculations .",
    "in many cases , the spin flips are paired : in a single spacing interval , the spin changes from one value to another and then back again , which agrees with the general picture connecting spin transitions to avoided - crossings caused by shape - deformation.@xcite in some rare cases , triple - transitions are observed , such as @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 or @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 . in other cases , the spin transition is unpaired , presumably because pairing due to an avoided - crossing is destroyed by a change in electron number .",
    "several experiments have traced the correlation between ground states or excited states as the number of electrons changes,@xcite and often see a surprising degree of correlation .",
    "the relatively weak scrambling and gate effects that we find offer a way to understand these results .    to conclude",
    ", we have investigated the scrambling and gate effects for two different one - particle spectra ",
    "self - consistent kohn - sham and thomas - fermi  of a realistic model quantum dot .",
    "our main findings are : ( 1 ) the genuine scrambling effect  the one associated with the thomas - fermi spectra  is _ significantly smaller _ for the smooth potential considered here than in earlier work using hard wall confinement .",
    "( 2 )  as a consequence , scrambling for the kohn - sham spectra , which involves both genuine scrambling and residual interactions , is entirely dominated by residual interactions .",
    "its magnitude agrees with those from a random plane wave model of the wave functions .",
    "( 3 ) finally , fluctuations caused by the gate are similar in magnitude for the two spectra .",
    "a lateral plunger gate causes significantly larger fluctuations than those caused by scrambling , contrary to the case of a uniform `` generic '' gate .",
