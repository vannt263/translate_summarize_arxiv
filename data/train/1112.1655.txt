    "the uvot photometry was done using nasa s heasoft software package .",
    "this package provides a complete assistance for doing photometry for measurements done by various telescopes ( e.g. swift , cgro , integral ) .",
    "for photometry , contrary to the suggestions of the software manual , we explored various aperture sizes between @xmath0 `` and @xmath1 '' ( instead of keeping @xmath2 \" at all times ) to get the most usable data .",
    "then we chose those aperture sizes , which provided the most accurate results .",
    "for a given filter band we used the best aperture size , meaning that in some cases when obtaining photometry for a given grb we used various apertures depending on the filter band .",
    "all uvot magnitudes are in the standard uvot photometric system @xcite .",
    "magnitudes obtained by ground based telescopes were taken from gcns ( in detail see at references @xcite ) .",
    "when converting magnitudes to fluxes , we used the methods described in @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "x - ray data is taken from the xrt observations available from @xcite . according to our results we suggest 19 magnitude as acceptable faintest limit in the uvot photometry system .",
    "we used the _ mpfit _ package @xcite for fitting broken power - law functions to the lightcurves with the @xmath3 convention .",
    ":  the afterglow was detected by several telescopes , but due to the lack of ground based observations we could not fit the data at the late times .",
    "however , the uvot magnitudes show a lightcurve flattening about @xmath4 ks . after this time",
    "the uvot slope in `` white '' filter is @xmath5 , which is inconsistent with the one inferred from filter r , @xmath6 ( from @xmath7 to @xmath8 hours after the trigger ) , unless there was an additional steepening in the lightcurve .",
    "the redshift was inferred from the lyman-@xmath9 absorption line and it is @xmath10 , while other lines ( o i , si ii , c ii , si iv , c iv , fe ii and al ii ) suggest @xmath11 .    :  the @xmath9 index in the r band disagrees with those in the gcns ( @xmath12 between @xmath4 and @xmath13 ks ) , but after this time the results were similar .",

    "the observations have already begun @xmath15 seconds after the bat trigger and the tarot magnitudes even show the brightening interval of the lightcurve .",
    "furthermore , in the uvot s v and uvw1 band there is an additional rebrightening around 800 s , which can be also seen in the x - ray band , but unfortunately , this part is lacking in ground based observations .",

    "the afterglow brightened during the first 1.3 ks , then faded until @xmath17 10 ks . starting this time the plateau phase appeared , which lasted at least until @xmath18 hours after the trigger .",

    ":  this burst was very luminous with a bright afterglow .",
    "the kait observations show an initial decline until 92 s then a rise at @xmath21 . after that time the lightcurve showed two breaks : the first occurred around @xmath22 s , the second at @xmath23 hours after the trigger .",
    "however , in the uvot observations we found a third break ( from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ) , which is in between the previous two , at @xmath26 s , but ground based telescopes did not report about such an event .",
    "this break explains why after the ( @xmath27 s ) epoch the uvot slopes did not match to the slopes reported in gcns ( between @xmath22 s and @xmath23 hours @xmath28",
