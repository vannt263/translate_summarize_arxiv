    "quantum computers , if available , could perform certain operations in a massive parallel way , which would lead to an exponential speed - up as compared to the performance of classical computers .",
    "furthermore , medium - size quantum information processing devices could be used in a number of applications such as , for instance , quantum communication and quantum cryptography .",
    "several physical realizations of quantum bits , i.e. the elementary building blocks of quantum computers , have been proposed .",
    "the best studied ones are trapped ions , nmr in the liquid state and cavity qed . here",
    "we discuss solid - state nano - electronic realizations .",
    "they appear promising since they can be scaled up to large numbers of qubits and are most easily embedded in electronic circuits .",
    "josephson junction circuits are particularly suitable for quantum information processing , since they combine the intrinsic coherence of the superconducting state and the possibility to control the circuit dynamics by voltage and magnetic flux pulses .",
    "their fabrication and manipulation are possible by present - day technologies .",
    "the dynamical variables in these circuits are the charges on the islands and the phases of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "both are canonically conjugated , and heisenberg s uncertainty principle holds for them .",
    "depending on the ratio of two characteristic energies  the typical charging energy , which favors well - defined charges , and the josephson energy , which favors the phase degree of freedom  the charge or the flux can have a well - defined value , while the other fluctuates strongly .",
    "either charge  @xcite or phase  @xcite degrees of freedom can be used to store and process quantum information .",
    "here we describe charge and phase ( flux ) nano - electronic quantum bits and possible designs of the circuits in both cases .",
    "the basic elements of a quantum computer are the qubits , i.e.   two - state quantum systems which can be manipulated , separately for each qubit , by the control of the hamiltonian .",
    "this allows performing single - bit logic gates .",
    "additionally , one needs to be able to couple qubits in a controlled way to perform two - bit logic operations .",
    "the whole system should stay coherent for a sufficiently long time , that is , the coupling to the environment needs to be weak .",
    "finally , to read - out the information about the quantum state of the system a quantum measurement should be performed .",
    "below we discuss these steps for the relevant designs .",
    "the simplest design of the josephson qubit using the charge degree of freedom is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : bits]a .",
    "it consists of a superconducting electron box with a low - capacitance josephson junction , with capacitance @xmath0 and josephson energy @xmath1 , biased by a voltage source through a gate capacitor @xmath2 .",
    "if the superconducting gap is large enough then at low temperatures odd - parity states are forbidden  @xcite , and the charge on the superconducting island is a multiple of the cooper - pair charge @xmath3 , measured relative to the neutral state .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is then given by @xmath4 where the phase difference across the junction , @xmath5 , is canonically conjugated to @xmath6 .",
    "the charging energy , with scale @xmath7 , is chosen to dominate over the josephson term @xmath1 .",
    "in equilibrium at low temperature , @xmath8 , the system is in the ground state , which  away from certain degeneracy points  is approximately the charge state with the minimal charging energy . only near the voltages @xmath9 , where the states with @xmath6 and @xmath10 cooper pairs on the island are degenerate , the weak",
    "josephson coupling mixes the charge states strongly .",
    "biased near these voltages the system reduces to a two - state problem , with the hamiltonian in the basis of charge states @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 here @xmath14 denotes the difference in charging energy between two relevant charge states , the tunneling amplitude between the states is @xmath15 , and the capacitance of the qubit in the circuit is @xmath16",
    ".    the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamepsdelta ] ) can be controlled through the gate voltage .",
    "the josephson coupling in the second term can also be controlled if the junction is replaced by the dc - squid threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath17 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bits]b",
    ". then the effective josephson energy is @xmath18 . with the control over these two parameters one can perform any single - bit logic operation . in the idle state between the operations",
    "one keeps the qubit at the degeneracy point @xmath19 and chooses @xmath20 .",
    "hence the hamiltonian vanishes , @xmath21 , and the qubit s state does not evolve in time . to perform an operation",
    ", one can switch the flux to a different value for a finite time @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting change of the quantum state of the qubit is described by the unitary operator @xmath23 .",
    "a voltage pulse results in another elementary operation , @xmath24 . with a series of ( no more than three ) such operations with proper time spans any @xmath25 unitary operation , that is any single - qubit logic gate can be performed .",
    "the typical times of the operations are of order @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the manipulations of the state of the qubit are similar to the manipulations used in nmr experiments , and various techniques familiar from nmr applications can be employed .",
    "for instance , instead of rectangular voltage pulses one can use resonant ac - pulses to induce coherent transitions between the qubit s states . then the typical operation time is determined by the amplitude of the ac - pulse and can be optimized .",
    "it should be slow enough to make the control easy and fast enough to maximize the number of logic operations performed within the phase coherence time .",
    "a controllable two - state quantum system can be realized also in the opposite limit of dominating josephson coupling .",
    "the simplest design is the rf - squid ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bits]c ) that is a superconducting loop interrupted by a josephson junction .",
    "the phase difference across the junction , @xmath28 , is controlled by the flux @xmath29 in the loop , which fluctuates around the externally applied value @xmath17 . with the josephson , charging and magnetic contributions taken into account , the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the self - inductance of the loop and @xmath0 the capacitance of the junction . the charge @xmath32 on the leads is canonically conjugated to the flux @xmath29 .",
    "if the self - inductance is large ( @xmath33 is slightly larger than 1 ) and the externally applied flux is close to @xmath34 , the two first terms in the hamiltonian form a double - well potential near @xmath35 . at low temperatures only the lowest states in the two wells",
    "contribute to the physics of the system .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian of this two - state system is again given by eq.([hamepsdelta ] ) , where now @xmath36 is the asymmetry of the double well potential , and @xmath37 is the tunneling amplitude between the wells .",
    "the latter can be controlled through the height of the barrier , which is determined by @xmath1 .",
    "this josephson energy can be controlled , in turn , if the junction can be replaced by the dc - squid , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bits]d .    with two external parameters governing the hamiltonian , elementary @xmath38- and @xmath39-rotations can be performed , as we have seen in the previous subsection .",
    "they can be driven either by switching the external flux for a finite time or by resonant pulses .",
    "the rf - squid described above was discussed in connection with the ` macroscopic quantum coherence ' , that is coherent oscillations of a quantum system between two macroscopically different states @xcite .",
    "however , the requirements of sufficiently large self - inductance and josephson energy of the junction make the rf - squid very susceptible to external noise , and the experiments with the rf - squid were not successful so far . to overcome this difficulty mooij et al .",
    "@xcite suggested to use a smaller superconducting loop with three junctions ( one with controllable critical current ) .",
    "then the double - well potential is formed by josephson terms for the junctions , and lower critical currents can be used . as a result",
    "the system should stay coherent for a longer time .",
    "we shall discuss dephasing effects in section  [ section : dephasing ] .",
    "to perform a quantum computation with a register of qubits two - bit logic operations are necessary .",
    "for such an operation , which is a unitary transformation of the quantum state of two qubits , the couplings between the qubits should be controlled individually for each pair . in this section",
    "we discuss realization of such interactions for charge and flux qubits .",
    "one possibility to couple charge qubits is to join them in parallel to a common inductor , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : coupledbits]a .",
    "then their dynamics is coupled to the oscillations in the @xmath40-circuit , which is formed by the inductor and the capacitances of all @xmath41 qubits in parallel .",
    "if the frequency @xmath42 of these oscillations is higher than typical qubit frequencies , the oscillatory degrees of freedom are not excited by the qubit manipulations , but still they provide the effective coupling between the qubits  @xcite .    to clarify the physics of the coupling and to estimate its magnitude",
    ", we provide a simple derivation .",
    "the current through the inductor , @xmath43 , is given by the contributions of all qubits , @xmath44 . in terms of the flux",
    "@xmath29 through the inductor the hamiltonian of the oscillations is expressed as @xmath45 or @xmath46 here @xmath32 is the charge canonically conjugated to @xmath29 .",
    "if the time - evolution of the qubits is slow compared to the oscillations , we can use an adiabatic approximation and consider @xmath43 as constant , and the oscillator remains in its ground state .",
    "the energy of the ground state of the first two terms in ( [ hamlc ] ) , @xmath47 , does not depend on @xmath43 , while the last term provides the current - dependent correction .",
    "this correction describes the effective coupling between the qubits , @xmath48 . in the basis of",
    "the qubits charge states individual current operators can be expressed as @xmath49 , leading to the interaction term @xmath50 this coupling can be controlled through external fluxes @xmath51 , which bias the squids of the qubits . between the operations we keep all @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 and the coupling is off . during single - bit operations we switch on @xmath54 for at most one qubit , so that the interaction term is still zero .",
    "when a two - qubit operation is needed , the fluxes are changed for two qubits , providing the interaction between them for a finite period .",
    "this interaction leads to a non - trivial unitary transformation of the quantum state of two chosen quantum bits , i.e. to a two - bit logic gate .",
    "this design allows performing both single- and two - bit operations by controlling the same external parameters ( fluxes and voltages ) as for individual qubits .",
    "one possibility to couple flux qubits is to use a flux transformer  @xcite which provides an inductive coupling between the qubits .",
    "each qubit has two loops , those of the rf- and dc - squids in the simplest rf - squid design .",
    "any loop of one qubit can be coupled to any loop of the other , giving rise to @xmath55 , @xmath56 or @xmath57 coupling terms . to turn off this coupling completely",
    ", one would need to have an ideal switch in the flux transformer .",
    "this switch is to be controlled by high - frequency pulses , and the related external circuit can lead to decoherence effects .",
    "an alternative is to keep the interaction on constantly and use ac driving pulses to induce coherent transitions between the levels of the two - qubit system ( cf",
    ".  refs .  ) .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is that permanent couplings lead to unwanted 2-qubit correlations between the logic operations .    here",
    "we discuss another design of a many - qubit circuit , which allows to control interactions via flux sources of individual bits .",
    "the circuit , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coupledbits]b , is similar to the register of charge qubits discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "it includes an @xmath40-circuit formed by a loop , with the self - inductance @xmath58 , interrupted by a small capacitor @xmath59 .",
    "the loop is coupled inductively to the set of flux qubits and mediates interaction between them .",
    "following the derivation in refs .",
    "one can find the effective coupling by integrating out the oscillations which are faster than the qubit s dynamics . a simple way to obtain the coupling is to notice that in the low - capacitance limit , @xmath60 ( almost decoupled qubits ) the effect of the qubits is to establish a voltage drop across the inductor @xmath58 , given by @xmath61 .",
    "here for each qubit @xmath62 is the flux in its loop , @xmath31 is the self - inductance of the loop and @xmath63 is the mutual inductance with the loop of the @xmath40-circuit .",
    "then the hamiltonian for the oscillator mode is @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being the charge conjugated to the flux @xmath29 through the @xmath40-circuit . by similar arguments as in the previous subsection we find that the oscillator provides the inter - qubit interaction term @xmath66 . in limit of the weak coupling to the @xmath40-circuit , the time derivatives of the qubits fluxes are given by @xmath67=\\delta\\phi_i\\delta_i \\hat\\sigma_y^i/\\hbar$ ] where @xmath68 is the separation between two minima of the potential of the rf - squid .",
    "hence , the interaction is given by @xmath69 this interaction can be controlled through tunneling amplitudes @xmath70 of individual qubits . to turn off the interaction",
    ", one should put @xmath70 to zero .",
    "the amplitudes can be exponentially suppressed by increasing the barrier heights .",
    "( note that in this case also the fluctuations of @xmath70 are exponentially suppressed , unlike for the charge qubits , where stronger fluctuations are present . )",
    "the absence of the interaction between the operations helps increasing the accuracy of the manipulations .",
    "due to the unavoidable coupling to environmental degrees of freedom the quantum state of the qubits gets entangled with the environment , which leads to dephasing effects .",
    "charge qubits are sensitive to the electromagnetic fluctuations in the external circuit and in the substrate and to background charge fluctuations .",
    "flux qubits are insensitive to the latter .",
    "various sources of dissipation for flux qubits are discussed in ref .  .",
    "here we estimate the effect of fluctuations in the external circuit .",
    "the control over the voltage or flux requires coupling the quantum system to a dissipative external circuit , which introduces fluctuation effects . the voltage fluctuations in charge qubits or the flux fluctuations in the main loop of flux qubits",
    "are coupled to @xmath71-degree of freedom .",
    "the external circuit can be parameterized by an effective impedance of the voltage ( flux ) source , which in turn can be modeled by an oscillator bath in the spirit of the caldeira - leggett model .",
    "the behavior of a two - state system coupled to an oscillator bath has been discussed in the context of the spin - boson model  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that the decay of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix of the qubit ( dephasing ) and the relaxation of the diagonal elements to their equilibrium values are described by the two time scales @xmath72 respectively . here",
    "@xmath73 gives the typical operation time ( cf .",
    "section 2 ) in terms of the level spacing @xmath74 of the qubit , @xmath75 is the temperature , and @xmath76 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath77 describes the strength of the dissipation . for charge qubits",
    "it is determined by the resistance @xmath78 of the voltage source in units of the large quantum resistance @xmath79 , @xmath80 a small gate capacitance @xmath81 provides a weak coupling between qubit and environment .    for flux qubits ,",
    "@xmath77 is fixed by the impedance @xmath82 of the current source in the input loop , which provides the flux bias , @xmath83 here @xmath63 is the mutual inductance of the input loop and the qubit s loop .",
    "the numerical prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ gammai ] ) is @xmath84 for the rf - squid and is also of the order of unity for the design of ref .  .",
    "the dephasing is slow for small loops and junctions with low critical currents .",
    "indeed , the argument in the bracket in ( [ gammai ] ) is proportional to @xmath85 . while this quantity should be slightly smaller than one for the rf - squid",
    ", it can be much larger for the design of mooij et al.@xcite , corresponding to slower dephasing .",
    "the qubit is equivalent to a spin-@xmath86 particle in the external magnetic field @xmath87 , while the environment produces an additional fluctuating field in @xmath88-direction .",
    "the component of the fluctuating field orthogonal to the external field ( with the magnitude proportional to @xmath89 ) induces transitions between the eigenlevels , while the longitudinal component ( @xmath90 ) leads to random fluctuations of eigenenergies .",
    "only the former process leads to relaxation ( [ relaxation ] ) , while both contribute to the dephasing ( [ dephasing ] ) .",
    "this observation explains the @xmath91-dependence of the decoherence rates ( [ dephasing ] ) , ( [ relaxation ] ) .",
    "the relaxation rate is slow for low - impedance voltage sources and high - impedance current sources .",
    "weak coupling to the external circuit , i.e. , small @xmath2 or small @xmath63 , helps further maintaining the coherence .",
    "the effect of fluctuations of the @xmath92-term in the hamiltonian ( in the flux circuit of the dc - squid - loop which controls the josephson coupling in both charge and flux qubits ) can be described in a similar way  @xcite . because of the different direction of the fluctuating effective ` magnetic field ' , @xmath89 and @xmath93 should be interchanged in those terms .",
    "the effect of these terms is relatively weak for the operation regimes discussed in refs .   and .",
    "to complete the quantum computation , one needs to read out the information about the quantum state of the qubits , that is to perform a quantum measurement . for charge qubits",
    "this can be accomplished by coupling the qubit capacitively to a single - electron transistor  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : measurement ] . during the computation",
    "the set is kept in the off - state @xmath94 , with no dissipative current and no additional decoherence .",
    "the only effect of the transistor is a renormalization of the capacitances in the qubit s circuit . to perform the measurement ,",
    "the transport voltage is switched to a sufficiently high value and the dissipative current starts to flow .",
    "the value of the current in the circuit of the transistor is very sensitive to the charge on the island of the qubit .",
    "monitoring the current , one can extract from the data information about the state of the qubit .    to study this quantum measurement process",
    ", we analyzed the time evolution of the density matrix of the coupled system of the qubit and the set  @xcite .",
    "the system is characterized by three energy scales : the typical coulomb energy of the transistor , @xmath95 , the charging energy of the qubit , @xmath96 , and the coulomb interaction between the charges of the qubit and the middle island of the set , @xmath97 .",
    "we choose @xmath95 to be the largest energy scale , @xmath98 .",
    "the josephson coupling @xmath99 is switched to a small ( or zero ) value before the measurement .",
    "the transport voltage should be large enough , of order @xmath100 , to overcome the coulomb energy gap between two charge states of the set .",
    "the value of this gap is slightly different for different states of the qubit , which leads to different tunneling rates @xmath101 through the transistor , with @xmath102 of order @xmath103 and @xmath104 of order @xmath105 . here",
    "@xmath106 is the dimensionless tunneling conductance of the junctions of the transistor , of the same order in both junctions . for definiteness",
    "we consider the limit @xmath107 , where essential features of the evolution can be seen , although the derivation can be performed in a wider parameter range .",
    "to describe the system we single out the most important degrees of freedom : the qubit s degree of freedom , the charge @xmath108 on the middle island of the set and the charge @xmath109 which passed through the transistor after the transport voltage is turned on , that is the time integral of the current .",
    "the microscopic degrees of freedom can be traced out , and a closed set of equations can be derived  @xcite for the elements of the density matrix , @xmath110 which are diagonal in @xmath41 and @xmath111 .",
    "the evolution of the system is characterized by three time scales . in the first stage the random tunneling processes in the set lead to the loss of the phase coherence of the qubit .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the reduced @xmath112 density matrix of the qubit , @xmath113 , decay to zero on a short time scale of order @xmath114 .    at a later stage",
    "the information about the qubit s state can be deduced from the current .",
    "the dynamics of the current in the set can be described by the probability distribution of the number of electrons @xmath111 which have passed through the transistor : @xmath115 . at the start of the measurement",
    "@xmath116 no electrons have tunneled , and @xmath117 . then the current begins to flow , and the peak shifts in the direction of positive @xmath111 and widens due to shot noise effects .",
    "since the two charge states of the qubit correspond to different net currents in the set , after some time the peak splits into two .",
    "the separation of the peak centers grows linearly with time , @xmath118 , while their width grows as @xmath119 .",
    "therefore they separate after time @xmath120 .",
    "the weights of the peaks after the separation are given by @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the initial state of the qubit @xmath123 , and a good quantum measurement is realized if @xmath111 is measured after @xmath124 .",
    "as expected , the measurement time is longer than the dephasing time .",
    "this ideal picture gets more complicated at even longer times . at finite , or fluctuating , @xmath1 the eigenstates of the qubit are different for different charges @xmath108 of the set , and the measurement induces transitions between them . after a long mixing time @xmath125",
    "the diagonal elements of the density matrix of the qubit become equal to @xmath86 , and the information about their initial values is lost completely . at the same time @xmath126 develops a plateau between the two peaks .",
    "the weights of the peaks decay exponentially . at longer times",
    "@xmath127 the plateau transforms into a peak around @xmath128 .",
