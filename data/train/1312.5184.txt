    "of course , our method of global choice of orientation affects the gluing matrices , but since the possible changes ( e.g. changing the order of the separation variables ) are applied to all tori simultaneously , the gluing matrices of the molecules considered in this section simultaneously change their signs ( @xmath482 ) .",
    "this only leads to another representatives of the same exact topological invariants .      in the system",
    "@xmath24 the set of degenerate closed orbits consists of the motions in the pre - image of the points @xmath289 .    [ theo3 ] the loop molecules of the points @xmath289 can be represented in the form shown in fig .",

    "then we obtain the picture of the molecular edges printed over a piece of the bifurcation diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtomolq1xn ] .    in the whole neighborhood of @xmath228 all @xmath420-cycles on the regular tori are induced by the periodic critical trajectories of the atoms @xmath486 .",
    "then from table  2 we readily obtain that both @xmath487 and @xmath488 ( no matter , incoming or outgoing ) are defined as @xmath489 . taking the chains marked with the points @xmath490",
    "we get @xmath491 from table  4 , the gluing matrix is @xmath492 at both points @xmath493 .    let us find the gluing matrices on the arcs connecting the atoms @xmath494 . to be definite ,",

    "the obvious substitution @xmath503 turns @xmath504 into @xmath505 .",
    "a similar reasoning leads to the equality @xmath506 on @xmath498 .",
    "finally we have that the map @xmath90 identifies two incoming bases at @xmath507 , so they give the same basis on the image torus in @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the gluing matrix on the arc is the identity matrix @xmath477 .",
    "another arc @xmath508 is considered analogously and gives the same result .",

    "shifting the bases @xmath509 from the points @xmath510 to the point @xmath511 ( i.e. , to the torus @xmath512 ) we get two bases @xmath513 and @xmath499 . in the same way as above , yields @xmath514 , but from we obviously have @xmath515 .",

    "[ figtomolq2xn ] . in this case",
    "the globally defined @xmath420-cycles are @xmath451 .",
    "since the connected components of the loop molecule differ exactly by the sign @xmath241 , this cycle is fixed for the whole component and is not affected by any identifications in the pre - image of @xmath103 .",

    "thus , the gluing matrix on the loops is the identity matrix .    finally , comparing the bases for segments @xmath211 and @xmath141 from table  4 we see that the gluing matrix is @xmath523 where @xmath524 .",
    "the theorem is proved .",

    "the matrix @xmath492 remains unchanged but all the identity matrices turn into @xmath526 .",
    "so , in this case we can avoid gluing matrices with the determinant equal to @xmath467 and the loop manifold is orientable .",
    "obviously , this can not be done for the molecules of the point @xmath229 and for some similar iso - integral molecules having loops rather than arcs .",
    "let us denote by @xmath527 the result of gluing @xmath187 handles and @xmath528 mbius bands to a closed 2-surface @xmath529 ( of course , it supposes cutting out small discs first ) . from theorem  [ theo3 ]",
    "we find the topology of the loop manifolds of the degenerate points .",

    "indeed , all @xmath532-marks in the molecules of @xmath289 are equal to @xmath533 and the loop manifolds are easily restored from the topology of the graph .",
