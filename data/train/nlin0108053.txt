    "the gutzwiller semi - classical quantization of classically chaotic systems relates quantum observables such as spectral densities to sums over classical unstable periodic orbits  @xcite .",
    "the work presented here is a step toward a formulation of such approximate short - wavelength theory of wave chaos for the case of linear elastodynamics .",
    "why elastodynamics ?",
    "the experiments initiated in ref.@xcite attain @xmath0  values as high as @xmath1 , making spectral measurements in elastodynamics competitive with measurements in microwave cavities at liquid helium temperatures  @xcite , and vastly superior to nuclear physics and room temperature microwave experiments for which the @xmath0 values are orders of magnitude lower , typically @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "for elastodynamics there are only a few experimental demonstrations  @xcite of the existence of unstable periodic orbits , and no theory that would predict them . while oxborrow measure about @xmath4 spectral lines , the current theory is barely adequate for computation of dozens of resonances .",
    "a more effective theory would find many applications such as in the frequency domain quality testing for small devices built from high @xmath0 materials .",
    "this unsatisfactory state of affairs is the _ raison dtre _ for the theoretical effort undertaken here .    while current experiments excel in measurements of eigenspectra of _ compact resonators _ , the periodic orbit theory computations of such bound system spectra are rendered difficult by the presence of non - hyperbolic phase space regions . as our primary goal is to derive and test rules for replacing wave mechanics by the short - wavelength ray - dynamic trajectories",
    ", we concentrate here instead on the problem of _ scattering _ off cylindrical cavities , for which the classical dynamics is fully under control . in the case of one cavity",
    "the exact scattering spectrum is known  @xcite . for the multiple - cavities case",
    "we generalize the quantum - mechanical ( qm ) s - matrix formalism for @xmath5-disk scattering  @xcite , and compute the exact resonances and the wigner time delays from the full elastodynamic wave - mechanical scattering matrix .",
    "we then compare the exact results with the corresponding quantities calculated in the short - wavelength approximation ( swa ) , and discover that the qm intuition fails us : the rayleigh surface waves ( which have no analog in the qm scattering problem ) dominate the low - frequency spectrum because of their weights and number , such that already the two - disk elastodynamic scattering problem displays chaotic features in this regime in contrast to its qm counter part .",
    "consider an infinite slab of an isotropic and homogeneous elastic material ( _ e.g. _ , polyethylene or isotropic quartz ) with parallel top and bottom plane boundaries , and an in - phase stimulus such that the system behaves quasi  two - dimensionally along the slab , with no excitation of or coupling to waves propagating perpendicular to the slab .",
    "the propagating waves are either the pressure or the shear solutions of the navier - cauchy equation  @xcite @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a vectorial displacement field , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the lam constants , @xmath10 the mass density and @xmath11 the frequency .",

    "the dotted and dashed lines represent the imaginary parts @xmath125 = @xmath126 @xmath127 and @xmath128 predicted by the isolated pressure @xmath129 and shear @xmath130 orbit , respectively . as the transverse oscillation of the @xmath130 orbit strongly mixes with the rayleigh waves of nearly the same wave velocity , the irregular band with the _ leading _ and _ subleading _ resonances arises from the interference of the rayleigh orbits with the @xmath130 orbit . due to this mixing , there are no resonances on the @xmath130 line .",
    "the rayleigh orbits include the factor @xmath131 which arises from the geometrical sum of the _ additional _ rayleigh waves around the half - cavity in the fundamental domain .",
    "these 1-cavity structures , which lead to the leading resonances in the 1-cavity case , correspond here to poles in @xmath132 which amplify the contributions of the rayleigh orbits already at topological length one , but which also complicate the searches for nearby genuine multi - scattering resonances , the zeros of @xmath132 .",
    "this is especially the case for the family _ i - add_.    below @xmath133 swa cycles of at most topological length two are needed to get a qualitative fit of the chaotic band labelled as _ ii - lead _ , whereas already order one is sufficient for the resonances _ i - lead _ , before they merge with the rising band _ ii - ris _ at about @xmath134 , and for the resonances _ i - add_. below @xmath135 , the swa expansion breaks down and a uniform approximation based on a multipole expansion as in ref .",
    "@xcite should take over . the dropping band , _ iii - drop _ , has a qm analog which is generated by franz creeping waves .",
    "the _ regular _ family of resonances ( see _ iii - reg _ and _ iv - reg _ ) corresponds to the @xmath129 orbit that dominates the qm two - disk case @xcite , but is subdominant here , and that couples neither to the complex rayleigh orbits nor to the shear orbit . when the _ rising band _ ( _ iv - ris _ ) crosses the regular band ( _ iii - reg _ ) , the cumulant orders three and four are interchanged .",

    "iii - sub_.    for the @xmath113 window shown in fig.[fig : a1_res ] , the periodic orbit sum can be truncated at length four , since the spectrum generated from the cumulant expansion to this order does not differ from the complete one to the resolution of this figure .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical diagonalizations of the @xmath137 matrices @xmath138 in the @xmath139 angular momentum space where @xmath140 has to satisfy the bound @xmath141 ) @xcite .",
    "we have derived the scattering determinant and calculated , in the low - frequency regime , the exact scattering resonances and wigner time delays for a quasi - two - dimensional isotropic and homogeneous elastodynamic slab with two cylindrical cavities .",
    "already the physics of this simplest possible multi - scattering system in elastodynamics with free boundary conditions is totally different from the one of quantum billiards at low frequencies : none of the _ measurable _ medium excitation ( _ e.g. _ , phase shifts , leading resonances ) can be understood without the rayleigh waves which do not have quantum mechanical counterparts . for circular boundaries",
    "they are barely damped at all @xcite and the diffraction constants , which link them at the different cavities to the shear waves , are still only weakly attenuated at low frequencies .",
    "these features are generic for smooth finite - size concave cavities .",
    "the pressure waves which are _ the _ analog of the scalar quantum mechanical ones play only a secondary role .",
    "a symbolic dynamics in the total space needs to account for cycles patched together from 4 kinds of segments : pressure , shear ( their sum is the topological length ) , anti- and clockwise rayleigh , implying an exponentially growing number of interfering periodic orbits .",
    "whether the topological increase or the attenuation of the rayleigh orbits eventually wins is still open .",
    "surface orbits of rayleigh type - with no counterpart in qm - are expected in general non - convex elastic resonators .",
    "generalizations to anisotropic media ( the highest @xmath0-value experiments are performed on single crystals of quartz ) , and applications of the above ray - dynamics techniques to resonator geometries used in experiments remain open problems ."
