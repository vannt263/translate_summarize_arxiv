    "experimental observations ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) via imaging and other means have established the occurrence of bifurcations in the stick - slip dynamics of the peeling of a stretchable adhesive tape pulled with a constant velocity off a circular spool which is free to rotate around its center .",
    "the older theoretical studies @xcite focused on the equations of motion and the more recent ones @xcite recognized the differential - algebraic equation ( dae ) structure of the formulations , and proposed mathematical approaches such as the inertial regularization @xcite to simulate the dynamics .",
    "however , research issues such as ( i ) the differential index ( see later in this work ) of the dae model , ( ii ) relationship of the differential index in the stick - slip regime to the bifurcation , and ( iii ) satisfaction of the adhesion - shear constitutive relationship ( the algebraic constraint ) in relation to the stick - slip regime of the dynamics follow naturally from the dae structure of the peeling dynamics . in this context",
    "it may be recalled that ordinary differential equation ( ode ) analysis has its limitations in dealing with daes since daes are not odes @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we address the above questions and show ( i ) that the peeling dynamics dae is a variable differential index system , with differential index ranging from two to possibly very high values in the stick - slip regime compared to being one otherwise , ( ii ) that the higher differential index implies an exponentially faster time scale for the peeling velocity relative to the peel front angle between the tape and the spool , and/or the tensile displacement of the tape , and ( iii ) that the above two properties lead to the nonlinear bifurcations .",
    "finally , ( iv ) we develop a homogenized ode representation of the peeling dynamics dae model along with a characteristic time scale for the homogenization .",
    "the homogenized ode scheme is illustrated with physically consistent numerical simulations .",
    "following the modeling approach in @xcite , the dynamics of the peeling of an adhesive tape off a circular spool is given as    @xmath1    [ peel ]    where @xmath0 , the contact or the peel front angle , is the angle between the radius passing through the point where the tape peels off the spool and the radius coinciding with the horizontal , @xmath2 is the tensile displacement or stretch of the tape which has an young s modulus @xmath3 and cross - sectional area @xmath4 so that @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the speed at which the tape is peeled at the point of the contact with the spool , or simply the peeling velocity and @xmath7 is the constant speed at which the free end of the tape is pulled along its longitudinal axis .",
    "the peeled tape from the point of contact to the point where it is pulled , is assumed to have negligible mass compared to the circular spool which has only in - plane rotational degree of freedom about its center of mass .",
    "the radius of the spool is @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the constant distance between the center of mass of the spool and the point where the longitudinal axis of the peeled tape meets the horizontal .",
    "the moment of inertia of the spool about its center of mass is @xmath10 .",
    "the angular velocity of the spool is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the function @xmath12 is the constitutive model for the adhesion depending on the constant pulling velocity @xmath7 and the peeling velocity @xmath6 .",
    "usually @xmath12 is modeled such that it increases as the tape sticks until it reaches a maximum and decreases as the tape peels off by slipping @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 are constants with respect to time and the other variables . the time varying quantities are @xmath14 and @xmath6 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath11 , @xmath15 , the peel front or contact angle @xmath0 and @xmath16 are positive counter - clockwise .",
    "the model is shown in figure [ model ] .",
    "the model ( [ peel ] ) can be formally obtained from the lagrangian of the system . with reference to figure [ model ] and in line with the lagrangian approach in @xcite",
    "the following work - energy relationships can be written in the generalized coordinate system @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18    [ lag ]    from which the euler - lagrange equations    @xmath19    [ lagderive ]    yield    @xmath20    [ lageqn ]    respectively . in ( [ lag ] ) , one can alternatively view the potential energy part of the lagrangian as the elastic energy stored in the tape , @xmath21 , to which the net work done on the system , @xmath22 , is added .",
    "it may be noted that when the approximations @xmath23 and that @xmath0 is a small angle hold , ( [ lageqn ] ) reduces to the same model as used in @xcite .",
    "the equations in ( [ peel ] ) coincide with those in @xcite when @xmath0 is considered positive clockwise and @xmath24 holds .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ av][tb ] ) , the material stretch rate equation ( [ str ] ) and the shear - adhesion constitutive model of the peeling ( [ sac ] ) constitute a dae system in which @xmath6 is the algebraic variable .",
    "the variables @xmath25 and @xmath2 are the differential variables .",
    "a measure of difficulty of solving a dae system is its differential index ( for definition and detailed treatment see @xcite ) . often referred to simply as index , the differential index is effectively the number of times differentiations of the equations in the dae system that should be done for obtaining a canonical first order ode system in all the unknown variables of the dae .",
    "theorem 5.4.1 in @xcite connects the difficulty of a numerical solution of a dae to its differential index as the condition number of the jacobian of the implicit integration method and shows it to increase exponentially with the differential index of the dae system .",
    "we characterize the peeling model ( [ peel ] ) with respect to its structure to show that the stick slip is essentially a problem of the dae ( [ peel ] ) switching to an arbitrarily large differential index from differential index 1 and that there is a resultant change in the time scale of evolution of the algebraic variable @xmath6 , the peeling velocity , compared to the differential variables of ( [ peel ] ) .",
    "we define the vectors @xmath26 we introduce the subscript @xmath27 for indexing a time varying quantity , e.g. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the derivatives @xmath30 are jacobian matrices whereas @xmath31 is a gradient vector .",
    "the differential index of ( [ peel ] ) is analyzed in the following .",
    "let @xmath32 exist and be non - zero at a time point @xmath27 with a @xmath33 satisfying ( [ peel ] ) .",
    "then ( [ peel ] ) has a unique local solution @xmath34,~ \\delta t \\ge 0 $ ] as a function of time.[sol ]    we observe that using the fundamental theorem of integral calculus , the jacobian of the dae ( [ peel ] ) with respect to @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36 of which @xmath37 is the schur complement , @xmath38 being the identity matrix .",

    "can be found over a neighborhood of @xmath42 if the jacobian @xmath39 is invertible .",
    "here we remark that we primarily intend to study the local behavior of the stick - slip dynamics and the existence of a local solution suffices for the purpose .",
    "subject to certain conditions , one can use the gronwal or bihari inequality , the leray - schauder principle and schauder fixed point theorem ( similar to the peano existence for an ode ; cf .",
    "chapter 3 of @xcite ) to obtain a proof of peano existence and osgood uniqueness of the global solution of ( [ peel ] ) for a given consistent initial condition .",
    "however a treatment of the global solution of ( [ peel ] ) is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "the local differential index of ( [ peel ] ) is @xmath43 where @xmath44 are as defined in lemma [ sol ] .",
    "[ pi ]    consider the jacobian of ( [ peel ] ) with @xmath45 as the @xmath46 operator .",
    "then , by the implicit function theorem , we can rewrite @xmath39 as @xmath47 which must be invertible at a @xmath33 satisfying ( [ peel ] ) for a unique local solution of ( [ peel ] ) to exist .",
    "being the integration operator , @xmath48 is @xmath49 ,  @xmath50 .",
    "it is obvious that the 2-norm of the local jacobian @xmath39 at any time point @xmath27 is @xmath51 .",
    "the 2-norm of the inverse of @xmath39 is the same order as that of absolute value of @xmath52 which is the inverse of the schur complement . using the neumann series yields @xmath53 the order of @xmath54 depends on the 2-norms of the coefficients of @xmath55 in the neumann expansion and",
    "let this be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a natural number . since @xmath50 , @xmath58 is @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "hence the 2-norm condition number of @xmath39 is @xmath60 . thus scaling the right hand side of ( [ peel ] ) with an operator of @xmath61 will well - condition @xmath39 , which by lemma [ sol ] is sufficient for obtaining a unique local solution of ( [ peel ] ) .",
    "this indicates @xmath62 differentiations of the equations in ( [ peel ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath43 differentiations are needed to obtain a canonical ode for @xmath64 and @xmath63 is thus the differential index of ( [ peel ] ) .",
    "the slip of the peeled tape occurs when the sticking resistance that has reached a maximum is overcome .",
    "the maximum adhesive force is reached when @xmath65 occurs in the constitutive relationship ( [ sac ] ) . in the following lemma ,",
    "we show that in the neighborhood of the maximum sticking resistance or adhesion and the subsequent slip on the yielding of the adhesive , ( [ peel ] ) tends to have to an arbitrarily high order of singularity as characterized by its high differential index .",
    "this is in contrast to the regime when the adhesion is not in the neighborhood of a maximum , or , @xmath66 or greater implies that ( [ peel ] ) has differential index one , since @xmath64 can be determined uniquely as a function of @xmath67 from ( [ sac ] ) by the implicit function theorem .    in the peeling model ( [ peel ] ) , let @xmath68 be a function which has at least a maximum over the range of values that the solution @xmath64 of ( [ peel ] ) takes and @xmath69 monotonically and smoothly goes to zero and has a negative value for values of peeling velocity which are greater than @xmath64 at which @xmath70 . then , along its solution in the neighborhood of @xmath42 , ( [ peel ] ) has differential index two if @xmath68 is a maximum at @xmath64 .",
    "further , in a neighborhood of @xmath64 at which @xmath68 is a maximum , ( [ peel ] ) can have an arbitrarily large differential index .",
    "when @xmath71 at the maximum , the peeling velocity solution @xmath72,~\\delta t > 0 $ ] can not be determined from ( [ sac ] ) , i.e. , one differentiation is not sufficient to obtain a notional first order ode in @xmath6 .",
    "hence the differential index of ( [ peel ] ) is higher than one if @xmath71 .    by the implicit function theorem and from ( [ av][str ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74",
    ". then , by lemma [ sol ] , @xmath6 can be determined explicitly in terms of @xmath75 and @xmath27 in the neighborhood of @xmath42 if @xmath76 is non - zero .",
    "if @xmath65 at @xmath64 , and a @xmath77 is chosen , then @xmath78 which is @xmath79 and hence , by lemma [ pi ] , ( [ peel ] ) has differential index two .",
    "let @xmath80 and @xmath81 be small positive numbers . if @xmath12is a maximum at @xmath82 , then in a neighborhood @xmath83 , @xmath84 holds since @xmath85 decreases monotonically from positive value to zero as @xmath6 decreases to @xmath64 .",
    "for the values of @xmath86 , @xmath87 is a small negative number by the property of the function @xmath12 .",
    "then , @xmath88 at some time point @xmath89 is such that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the differential index of ( [ peel ] ) is consequently @xmath92 by lemma [ pi ] .",
    "since @xmath93 goes to zero smoothly and monotonically and since @xmath74 , @xmath93 can cancel the first @xmath94 arbitrary large number of terms of the neumann series expansion .",
    "the local jacobian @xmath39 becomes rank deficient as the differential index tends to be arbitrarily high and @xmath95 . from lemma [ sol ] and [ pi ] ,",
    "then ( [ peel ] ) will no longer have a unique local solution over @xmath96 $ ] for some suitable @xmath97 .    from the above lemmas and the rank deficiency of the jacobian @xmath39 at the stick - slip , we conclude the following .",
    "the peeling model ( [ peel ] ) is a dae that has variable differential index which is at least one and can be arbitrarily high making the local solutions of ( [ peel ] ) non - unique at time points leading up to and following the maximum adhesion .",
    "[ ithm ]    physically , the high differential index near the maximum adhesion and the slip affects the process modeled by ( [ peel ] ) over short time sub - intervals over which @xmath98 , @xmath99 being the local differential index of ( [ peel ] ) .",
    "thus , the two time scales emerge with respect to the stick - slip dynamics of the peeling of an adhesive tape : one during when differential index is one and the other when the differential index rapidly increases to an arbitrarily high value .",
    "the second time scale is of interest with respect to a study of nonlinear bifurcation , the behavior of the peeling velocity @xmath6 at slip and the homogenization of @xmath6 over the same time scale .",
    "in this section we investigate the time scale of the stick - slip process .",

    "we observe that @xmath110 is of @xmath111 . from ( [ dvdx ] ) in lemma [ dvdxlem ]",
    ", we obtain by pre - multiplying both sides with @xmath112 , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the pseudo - inverse and @xmath115 is a rank one matrix , @xmath116 being the unit vector : @xmath117 using the structure of @xmath116 , and by taking norms we obtain from the right hand side of ( [ lsqx ] ) @xmath118 in which @xmath105 $ ] is a constant independent of @xmath55 .",
    "then , taking norms on the both sides of ( [ lsqx ] ) and by applying the cauchy - schwarz inequality , we get @xmath119 where @xmath120 are constants independent of @xmath55 .    from the above lemmas [ dvdxlem ] and [ ts ] together with lemma [ pi ] , and since @xmath121 , we conclude the following result .    in ( [ peel ] ) the peeling velocity @xmath64 changes",
    "exponentially faster than the time scale of change of either the peel front angle or the tape s tensile displacement or a linear combination of both , the exponent of the time scale being one less than the local differential index of ( [ peel ] ) .",
    "[ expv ]    as a corollary to theorem [ expv ] and from lemma [ hi ] it is obvious that in the neighborhood of the time points at which @xmath122 , i.e. , at the stick - slips , the magnitude of the change in the peeling velocities can be arbitrarily high .",
    "thus the peeling velocity undergoes a ( relatively ) stiff change when the maximum adhesion is approached or just following the slip .",
    "consequently , we have two distinct regimes in the dynamics of peeling of an adhesive tape :    * a regime during which the variables @xmath123 change with respect to time in the same scale as the peeling velocity @xmath6 .",
    "this happens when the local differential index of ( [ peel ] ) is one , i.e. , @xmath124 . we call this the _ slow scale_. * another regime when @xmath125 , i.e. , when the local differential index of ( [ peel ] ) is greater than one .",
    "this is the stick or adhesion regime followed by the slip , during which the peeling velocity changes exponentially faster compared to the change in @xmath0 or @xmath2 or in both .",
    "we shall refer to this as the _",
    "fast scale_.",
    "we remark that as a straightforward consequence of lemma [ ts ] a reformulation of ( [ sac ] ) as a an ode in which a small positive quantity is multiplied with the time rate of change of the peeling velocity may not always satisfy the constitutive relationship ( [ sac ] ) , especially , in the fast scale of the stick - slip regime when the rate of change of the peeling velocity is as large as the inverse of the small multiplier .    in this context",
    ", we consider the ode formulation in @xcite , which is arrived at by considering an additional kinetic energy term in the lagrangian due to the stretch rate of the extremely small mass of the tape and not by simply introducing a singular ode .",
    "the constitutive relationship ( [ sac ] ) then is an ode and not an algebraic equation . @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a small mass , involves @xmath128 on the left hand side .",
    "if @xmath94 is such that @xmath129 grows as @xmath130 or faster at the stick - slip points at which the schur complement tends to go to zero , then , @xmath131 does not necessarily go to zero in the high differential index stick - slip regime .",
    "also , @xmath132 and @xmath133 do not grow as fast as @xmath64 at the the stick - slip points with high local differential index .",
    "in such a case the role of the small mass becomes that of an inertial regularization parameter relative to the nearly singular ode model of the peeling dynamics .",
    "if an @xmath134 is chosen , this formulation has the same characteristics as a high differential index constraint . in the slower scale without the stick - slip ( in which the local differential index is one )",
    "@xmath64 does not change exponentially faster in time and the above formulation satisfies ( [ sac ] ) in the limit as @xmath135 .",
    "however , in the present work we have assumed that the stretched tape is mathematically massless , i.e. , any kinetic energy of the stretching tape is negligible .",
    "this is consistent with the standard experimental set - up described in works such @xcite .",
    "thus our approach obtains the dae ( [ peel ] ) and concerns about its behavior and regularization in the high differential index regime .",
    "in this section we see if the dynamics in the fast scale during the intermittent stick - slip affect nonlinear bifurcation in this regime . as @xmath136 , we show that the model ( [ peel ] ) is driven by the kinetics and kinematics ( [ av][str ] ) and not the adhesion - shear constitutive relationship ( [ sac ] ) . as the tape sticks almost the maximum , due to the rotational inertia of the spool peel front angle @xmath0 changes and due to the constant pulling velocity @xmath7 the tensile displacement @xmath2 changes , perturbing the dynamics ( [ av][str ] ) .",
    "let @xmath33 satisfy ( [ peel ] ) at @xmath27 such that @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "a perturbation @xmath139 of the peel front angle @xmath140 or @xmath141 of the tensile displacement @xmath142 or a combination of both regularizes the jacobian @xmath39 .",

    "when @xmath144 is @xmath145 or more , the schur complement @xmath37 of the jacobian @xmath146 of ( [ peel ] ) becomes non - zero and @xmath146 becomes invertible due to this regularization affected by the perturbation .",
    "regularization of the jacobian @xmath146 of ( [ peel ] ) implies that the dae ( [ peel ] ) can have a solution over some time interval containing the time point @xmath27 in the stick - slip regime .",
    "however this solution is not unique since the condition number of @xmath146 now depends on the perturbation @xmath147 from the rotational inertia of the spool or @xmath148 of the tensile diplacement of the tape due to the constant @xmath7 or both .",
    "lemma [ reglem ] shows how the dynamics at stick - slip may continue drawing from the perturbations from rotational inertia of the spool or from the constant pulling velocity or both , rather than the relaxation of the constitutive relationship ( [ sac ] ) .",
    "let @xmath33 at a time point @xmath27 in the stick - slip regime satisfy ( [ peel ] ) such that the local differential index of ( [ peel ] ) is significantly more than unity and possibly arbitrarily large .",
    "let the dae ( [ peel ] ) have a solution @xmath149 , @xmath150 being a time interval containing @xmath27 .",
    "then , following @xcite(cf .",

    "this indicates that the peeling velocity becomes highly sensitive to small perturbations at the local nonlinear bifurcation point .",
    "thus there is a near jump in the peeling velocity with the shear force peeling the tape remaining almost unchanged .",
    "the shear force is a function of the differential variables @xmath0 and @xmath2 that change exponentially slowly compared to the peeling velocity .",

    "it is obvious that capturing the arbitrarily large changes in the peeling velocity at the local nonlinear bifurcation points of ( [ peel ] ) is difficult because of the possibly arbitrarily high local differential index of ( [ peel ] ) .",
