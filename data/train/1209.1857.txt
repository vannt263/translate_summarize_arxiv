    "stochastic models describing how interacting individuals give rise to collective behavior have become a widely used tool across disciplines  ranging from biology to physics to social sciences.@xcite despite their conceptual simplicity , particle - based models can be computationally intractable for large systems of interacting particles , as is often the case in practical applications . in such cases , a continuum population - level description based on partial differential equations that can capture",
    "the overall population density becomes attractive .",
    "the challenge is then to predict the correct population - level description of the key attributes at the particle level ( such as interactions between individuals and evolution rules ) .",
    "in particular , the model of diffusive particles with hard - core repulsive ( or steric ) interactions is relevant to many applications , such as colloidal systems,@xcite ion transport,@xcite diffusion through polymers,@xcite biological cell populations@xcite and animal behavior.@xcite in our previous work @xcite we considered the diffusion under an external force of @xmath0 hard spheres in a bounded domain @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( of typical nondimensional diameter one ) .",
    "the particles were taken to be identical with nondimensional diameter @xmath3 and diffusivity @xmath4 .",
    "starting from the particle - level description , we used a method based on matched asymptotic expansions for a small but finite volume fraction to obtain the continuum model .",
    "the result is a nonlinear diffusion equation for the one - particle probability density function @xmath5 , @xmath6 -   { \\bf   f}({\\bf x } ) \\ , p \\right \\ } \\qquad \\text{in } \\qquad \\omega,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the nondimensionalized force ( drift ) .",
    "since the nonlinear term is positive for @xmath9 , we find that excluded - volume effects enhance the overall collective diffusion rate .",
    "the case of several different types of particle is relevant in many practical problems but has been paid far less attention by the mathematical community so far.@xcite for example , multiple populations of interacting agents appear in traffic flow with heterogeneous agents,@xcite pedestrian or animal motion ( e.g. ants going in opposite directions @xcite ) and cellular tumor invasion ( cancer and normal cells).@xcite they are also important in ion transport through membrane channels , as in many applications ions can be heterogeneous.@xcite another application is the extreme case in which one of the populations is motionless and blocks the motion of the others ; for example , anomalous diffusion in cell membranes due to obstruction ( from , e.g , the membrane skeleton mesh , fixed proteins , or lipid rafts).@xcite    much of the effort to describe multiple species with size - exclusion processes has been directed at on - lattice models , in which the motion of particles is restricted to taking place on a lattice and one defines certain hopping rules between lattice sites to account for the particle motion and interactions .",
    "a common approach is to take a continuum limit of the discrete model and obtain a partial differential equation ( pde ) describing the average occupancy of the agent population.@xcite for example , this strategy applied to a multi - species motility model based on simple exclusion process with drift ( or bias ) leads to a system of nonlinear advection ",
    "diffusion equations.@xcite more complicated rules have also been considered ; namely , particles that can bind to sites and interact not only with each other but also with a confined channel - like domain,@xcite or _ myopic _ agents ( in which the hopping probability depends on the number of unoccupied nearest - neighbor sites ) .",
    "@xcite recently , penington _ et .",
    "al . _ have considered a generalization of these specific on - lattice models to incorporate general interactions , and derived the associated continuum models systematically .",
    "@xcite    here , we are interested in off - lattice models , where particles each undergo a continuous brownian motion .",
    "we extend our previous work for identical hard - core interacting particles to the case when two types of particles are present .",
    "we call these two _ species _ the blues and reds after ref .  .",
    "specifically , we allow for each subpopulation to have a different number of particles with different sizes and diffusivities and to be under a different external force .",
    "this modeling of such system of interacting particles is typically based on a microscopic approach using @xmath0-coupled brownian motions , where @xmath0 is the total number of particles , or a macroscopic approach using partial differential equations ( pdes ) . for two species , the latter consists of a system of pdes for the two subpopulation densities . as mentioned before",
    ", microscopic models generally require many computationally intensive simulations to gain understanding of population - level behavior , and can become impractical to use .",
    "this is why continuum models are a very useful tool , and there is a lot of interest in predicting the correct macroscopic description of the particle - level attributes .",
    "this can be a very challenging task , especially when nontrivial interparticle interactions are present in the system .",
    "this is why continuum models are often defined phenomenologically ( that is , written directly at the continuum level rather than derived from their discrete counterparts ) or by making assumptions that can not be related to individual behavior .",
    "for instance , closure approximations ( which assume independence between individuals at some stage ) are commonly used , yet often generate errors in the resulting continuum model . in this work",
    "we use instead a systematic approach based on the method of matched asymptotic expansions to derive the macroscopic model of the two species system , generalizing the result .    the first part of this work",
    "is concerned with the derivation of the continuum pde model from the microscopic particle - based model .",
    "we first introduce the microscopic description of the system based on @xmath10-coupled stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , where @xmath2 is the problem dimension , and its associated fokker ",
    "planck ( fp ) equation for the joint probability density of the system .",
    "we then perform a systematic asymptotic analysis of the fp equation in the limit of small but finite particle volume fraction , which results in a nonlinear cross - diffusion system of pdes for the two subpopulations densities of each species .",
    "the nonlinear terms arise as a result of the excluded - volume effects in the system .",
    "we compare solutions to this model with stochastic simulations of the microscopic model to assess the validity of our approach , and find very good agreement .",
    "we also compare solutions for finite - size particles with those corresponding to point particles to investigate the importance of excluded - volume effects .",
    "second , we examine how the continuum model can be used to determine the transport coefficients .",
    "the fact that the model keeps two distinct densities enables us to distinguish between two alternative notions of diffusion coefficient : the collective diffusion coefficient , which describes the evolution of the total density , and the self - diffusion coefficient , which describes the evolution of a single tagged particle.@xcite this is in contrast with the one - species model,@xcite from which we could only `` extract '' the collective diffusion coefficient .",
    "the reason for that is that , although both diffusion coefficients are defined for a system with identical particles , to describe the self - diffusion coefficient we need to _ tag _ one individual particle and keep its probability density `` accessible '' in the continuum model . with the two species model",
    "this can easily be done by taking the tagged particle to constitute the second species . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first continuum pde model that can be used to explain both types of diffusion .",
    "this makes it well suited to interpret experimental data from diffusion measurement experiments , which can often produce unexpected / misinterpreted results.@xcite    in the third part of this work , we explore the properties of the cross - diffusion pde model .",
    "we find that rewriting the system in terms of its free energy and the mobility matrix can be a very useful tool to study the equilibria and stability of the system . in this alternative form , know as the gradient flow form , the evolution of the system can be interpreted as a probability flow down the gradients of the free energy .",
    "while this gradient flow structure is relatively well understood in the scalar case ( one species ) , the task of obtaining an associated free energy can be very challenging in the case of systems.@xcite for instance , in our case we are only able to write down an explicit free - energy functional under some conditions .",
    "another use of the gradient - flow structure is that it gives an explicit upper bound on the particle volume fraction for the validity of our asymptotic model .",
    "our starting point is a system of @xmath0 hard spheres ( or disks ) diffusing and interacting in a bounded domain @xmath11 in @xmath12 of typical dimensionless volume of order one .",
    "suppose there are @xmath13 blue particles of diameter @xmath14 and constant diffusion coefficient @xmath15 and @xmath16 red particles of diameter @xmath17 and constant molecular diffusion coefficient @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "note that we could have chosen to nondimensionalize so that one of the two dimensionless diffusion coefficients @xmath20 or @xmath21 is set to one .",
    "however , we choose deliberately not to do so so that the resulting model is symmetric upon exchange of the blue and red labels .",
    "also note that we are not making explicit any relationship between the molecular diffusivity and the particle size ( as it might exist if , say , the stokes  einstein relation holds in the system ) .",
    "we assume that the particles occupy a small volume fraction , so that @xmath22 .",
    "we suppose that the only interaction between particles is hard core repulsion ( so that the particles can not overlap ) , neglecting any electrostatic or hydrodynamic interaction forces .",
    "we denote the centers of the particles by @xmath23 at time @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "each centre evolves according to the overdamped langevin sde    [ sde2 ] @xmath26    where the @xmath27 are @xmath0 independent @xmath28-dimensional standard brownian motions and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the external forces on the blue and red particles , respectively .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where the external force acting on the @xmath31th particle depends only on its position @xmath32 , that is , @xmath33 .",
    "this excludes external forces such as electromagnetic and hydrodynamic forces , in which case @xmath34 would depend on the positions of all the particles @xmath35 .",
    "we suppose that the initial positions @xmath36 are random and , within the same species , identically distributed .",
    "let @xmath37 be the joint probability density function of the @xmath0 particles .",

    "splitting the position vector @xmath45 into the position vector for the blue particles , @xmath46 , and for the red particles , @xmath47 , equation can be rewritten as    [ twofp ] @xmath48 + \\vec \\nabla_{\\vec x_r }   \\cdot   \\big[d_r \\vec \\nabla_{\\vec x_r } \\ ,   p -   \\vec f_r(\\vec x_r ) \\ , p \\big ] \\quad   \\textrm{in } \\quad   \\omega_\\epsilon^{n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the drift acting on the blue particles [ first @xmath50 components of @xmath51 , and analogously for @xmath52 .",

    "the domain of definition @xmath60 is known as the _ configuration space_. on the collision surfaces @xmath61 we have the reflecting boundary condition @xmath62 \\cdot   { \\vec n } = 0 \\qquad \\text{on } \\qquad   \\partial \\omega_\\epsilon ^n,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 denotes the unit outward normal .",
    "the initial condition on @xmath64 is @xmath65    since all the particles within the same species ( blue or red ) are identically distributed , the initial distribution @xmath66 is invariant to permutations of the particles labels _ within the same species_. the form of then means that @xmath64 itself is invariant to permutations of the blue or red particle labels for all time .    as in ref .  , our goal is to reduce the high - dimensional pde model to a low dimensional pde model for the marginal density function of one particle .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , instead of obtaining an equation for @xmath67 comprising the collective effect of @xmath0 identical particles , now we will have two marginal density functions , one representative of the blue particles and one representative of the red particles . because all blue particles are identical and all red particles are identical , we are interested in the marginal density function of , say , the first blue particle and the last red particle , given by    @xmath68    respectively .",
    "we aim to reduce the high - dimensional pde for @xmath64 to a low - dimensional _ system _ of pdes for @xmath69 and @xmath70 through a systematic asymptotic expansion as @xmath71 .      in the particular case of point particles ( @xmath72 )",
    "the model reduction is straightforward . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 particles are independent and the domain is @xmath73 ( no holes ) , which implies that the internal boundary conditions in vanish . therefore @xmath74 and the evolution equations for the one - particle density functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 follow from integrating equation multiplied by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , over the configuration space @xmath77 using    [ 2:point ] @xmath78,\\\\   \\label{point_eqr } \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial t}({\\bf   x},t ) & =   { \\boldsymbol{\\nabla } } _ { { \\bf x } } \\cdot \\left[d_r { \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}_{{\\bf   x } } \\ ,   r -    { \\bf f}_r({\\bf   x } ) \\ , r \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xmath79 .",

    "here @xmath85 , and similarly for @xmath86 .      when @xmath14 and/or @xmath17 are greater than zero , the internal boundary conditions in mean the particles are no longer independent",
    ". the integration of over @xmath87 results in integrals over the _ collision surfaces _ , on which @xmath64 must be evaluated .",
    "when the particle volume fraction is small , the dominant contributions to these collision integrals correspond to two - particle collisions .",
    "this implies that if the case of @xmath88 can be solved it can easily extended to arbitrary @xmath0.@xcite for two species three types of interaction with @xmath88 are possible : either two blue particles , either two red particles , or one blue particle and one red particle interacting .",

    "[ sec : diffusions ] we have seen how our multicomponent diffusion system involves the study of a diffusion matrix that describes how the flux of one component is influenced by its own density gradient and the density gradient of the other component in the system .",
    "these ideas can be related with the thermodynamic onsager reciprocal relations , which establish that in a system fluctuating around its equilibrium a relationship between certain fluxes and thermodynamic forces must hold.@xcite the onsager relations are defined assuming the fluctuations around the equilibrium are small ( so that the relationship is linear ) . in particular , if in a system we have the following relations between fluxes @xmath401 and forces @xmath402 , @xmath403 the onsager reciprocal relations requires symmetry in the cross - terms , that is , @xmath404 .",
    "the onsager relations are a macroscopic consequence of microscopic time reversibility ( principle of detailed balance).@xcite@xmath405 note that coefficients @xmath406 can be nonlinear functions of the variables.@xcite@xmath407 gupta and cooper@xcite study the relationship between the matrix @xmath408 and the diffusion matrix @xmath190 in a linear multicomponent diffusion , and find that @xmath190 must be positive definite for the onsager relations to hold .",
    "it should be pointed out that while the onsager relations have been named the fourth law in thermodynamics by some authors , their validity has yet to be indisputably established .",
    "for instance , many valid multicomponent diffusion models have been found to be inconsistent with these relations.@xcite    we proceed to investigate in which cases , if any , our cross - diffusion model is consistent with the onsager relations .",
    "it is appropriate to consider the free - energy gradient with respect to the densities to be the force @xmath409 driving the system to its _ minimum _ free - energy equilibrium state.@xcite@xmath405 the gradient - flow structure fits with the form required in , and the question is for which cases the mobility matrix @xmath410 , @xmath408 in , is symmetric . in sec .",
    "[ sec : grad flow - entropy ] we found two situations for which our system satisfies this : the mobility matrices for the large number of particles approximation and for a zero potential ( with the appropriate choice of the parameter @xmath314 ) are indeed symmetric .    the fact that in a system with a positive definite diffusion matrix the onsager relations hold may be related to analytical work on parabolic systems .",
    "it is well known that , in hyperbolic or parabolic systems , the existence of a free - energy functional is equivalent to the existence of a change of unknowns which `` symmetrizes '' the system.@xcite for parabolic systems , `` symmetrization '' means that the transformed diffusion matrix is symmetric and positive definite.@xcite note that in sec .",
    "[ sec : grad flow - entropy ] the change of unknowns consisted of going from @xmath411 to the so - called _ entropy variables _ @xmath412.@xcite the equivalence between onsager relations and symmetrization comes from the fact that the symmetry is a necessary condition for the entropy production rate to have a sign , itself a condition for the system to be compatible with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "although these analytical results seem promising in order to find a free energy for the general form of our system with non - zero potentials , it should be pointed out that finding the change of variables that make our system symmetric ( in the sense described in ref .  )",
    "can be in general as challenging as finding the free energy itself .",
    "a first step would be to find a change of unknowns for which the system can be put in a form with no drift terms .    to conclude this section",
    ", we check that the result in ref .   that the original diffusion matrix must be positive definite holds in our case . to @xmath413 , our diffusion matrix has eigenvalues @xmath414 for @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and vice versa .",
    "a lower bound is @xmath415 $ ] , from which we find that @xmath416 ( since we must have small volume fraction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath417 ) . therefore , provided there is a small volume fraction , our diffusion matrix is positive definite and hence , as we have already mentioned above , the onsager relations hold for our system with zero - potentials .",
    "in this paper we have considered the diffusion of two interacting species of hard spheres , extending the model derived in ref .   to incorporate particles of different sizes , different diffusivities and under different external forces .",
    "the result is a nonlinear cross - diffusion pde system for the two marginal probability densities associated to each species .",
    "this approach enables us to describe a complicated system of interacting particles with a simple the continuum pde model whilst capturing the hard - core interactions at the particle level .",
    "these interactions emerge as nontrivial nonlinear terms in the continuum model , involving cross - coupling terms which can be interpreted in terms of the inter - species competition at the population - level .",
    "in addition to providing some insight on the system s behavior , the continuum model is relatively easy to solve and analyze .",
    "we have assessed the validity of our continuum approach to predict the behavior of the system by comparing its numerical solutions with stochastic simulations of the discrete particle - based model .",
    "we have found very good agreement between the two , supporting the idea that by solving a simple system of pdes we can capture the same population - level behavior observed after many repetitions of expensive stochastic simulations .",
    "our analysis is valid in the limit of small but finite particle volume fractions so that pairwise interactions are the dominant ones .",
    "this excludes situations close to the jamming limit .",
    "our method uses matched asymptotic expansions in the particle volume fraction to derive the continuum model in a systematic way as a perturbation of the interaction - free case .",
    "because of the perturbative nature of the method , we expect its accuracy to decline as the volume fraction increases and eventually cease to be valid .",
    "in particular , by writing the system in a _ gradient - flow _ form in terms of the free energy functional and a mobility matrix , we can use the singularity of the mobility matrix as an indicator of the break - down of the model ; this occurs at roughly 50% volume fraction . despite the limitation of a low - volume fraction ,",
    "we believe our method can provide insight into the mechanisms by which particle - level characteristics emerge at the population - level .",
    "our method is not based in the thermodynamic limit which requires the number of particles @xmath0 to tend to infinity together with the system volume.@xcite therefore , the continuum fokker  planck ( fp ) model derived here should not be misinterpreted as a deterministic model for the concentrations of the two species in the system , valid only when the number of particles @xmath0 is large . while it can be used in this situation",
    "if required , we emphasize that in our work the reduced fp model is valid for any @xmath0 ( one could set @xmath418 ) .",
    "in other words , the continuum system is _ not _ a deterministic model , but rather a pde system for the _ probabilities _ of finding a blue and a red particle at a given position and given time .",
    "our two - component drift  diffusion model captures an enhancement of the collective diffusion rate due to excluded - volume interactions between particles of the same species ( as we had already found in our previous work @xcite ) , as well as a reduction of the collective diffusion due to interactions with particles of the other species .",
    "this structure is useful not only to study the collective diffusion in terms of the particles volume fraction , but also to analyze the self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "the latter describes the evolution of a single tagged particle , and it can be extracted from the model by choosing one of the species to have only one _ tagged _ individual .",
    "in contrast to the collective diffusion , which increases with volume fraction ( or relative to point particles ) , the self - diffusion coefficient decreases with volume fraction .",
    "thus the two species model can be used to characterize transport properties of a system of _ identical _",
    "particles by distributing them in two subpopulations of @xmath214 and one particles respectively . to our knowledge , such a continuum model capable of explaining both the collective and individual diffusion coefficient has not been reported in the literature / previous works .",
    "we have briefly described two experimental procedures to obtain diffusion measurements from real systems , namely a single - particle tracking method to measure the particle s mean - square displacement ( msd ) and the ensemble - averaged method frap ( fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ) .",
    "while it is well understood that the msd can be related to the self - diffusion coefficient , there is some debate and confusion over the interpretation of frap experiments.@xcite several methods based on fitting curves to frap experimental data exist,@xcite but none appears to have identified the fact that frap is measuring a collective transport property .",
    "we believe that our two species model could be used to model the frap experiment systematically and provide an improved framework to interpret its results .",
    "as can be seen from the frap model , in general , the measured quantity will not be a pure diffusion coefficient ( such as the collective diffusion coefficient , as one might be tempted to think from the fact that frap gives an ensemble - averaged measurement ) but a mixture of collective diffusion with advection due to gradients in the concentration of the photobleached species .",
    "we have investigated for which values of the parameters the cross - diffusion system accepts a gradient - flow structure in terms of a free - energy functional ; this structure is useful to study the equilibria of the system as well as its stability .",
    "namely , the stationary solutions of the system correspond to the minimizers of the free energy , and the stability can be studied from the convexity of the free energy functional near its equilibria .",
    "previous work on the diffusion of two species with size - exclusion interactions using a lattice - based model @xcite led to a continuum population - level description which is different from our reduced model ( which does not restrict the motion of particles to a lattice ) .",
    "in other words , the two approaches ( on- and off - lattice models at the particle - level ) result in different reduced models , even though they are trying to describe the same problem",
    ". it would be interesting to study which rules one needs to prescribe on the lattice model in order to achieve a certain population - level description .",
    "we will address this issue in future work .",
    "the model presented in this work can be extended to consider the diffusion of finite - size particles through obstacles , which has many important applications in porous media and diffusion in biological systems .",
    "this may be achieved by setting the diffusivity of one of the species ( the obstacles ) to zero .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that it makes it very easy to study diffusion through spatially varying concentrations of obstacles.@xcite another interesting extension is to consider anisotropic particles@xcite and examine how the continuous pde model changes with nonspherical particles .",
