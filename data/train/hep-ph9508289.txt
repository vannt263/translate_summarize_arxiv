    "despite rather extended study of quantum groups as mathematical objects[1 - 7 ] , little has been done in the way of connecting them with observable phenomena , but some papers in this direction have appeared [ 8 - 11 ] . in such theories , the deformation parameter q is a function of a dimensionless combination of constants , so that in the limit of @xmath3 , we recover the undeformed theories , this may for example correspond to the low energy limit .",
    "for instance , newtonian mechanics can be thought of as the low velocity limit ( @xmath4 ) of the relativistic mechanics . in this paper",
    "we use quantum groups in deforming the flavour symmetry of hadrons , with the help of the standard q - deformation @xcite of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . knowing that flavour symmetry is not an exact symmetry of nature , we chose to deform the flavour group rather than the other symmetry groups of hadrons .",
    "however , as we shall see later , it becomes clear that deformation of either spin or colour symmetry is unavoidable .",
    "we placed hadrons in representations of quantum groups so that in the limit @xmath3 , the standard decuplet , octet and singlet representations are recoverd .",
    "the price of using quantum groups as symmetry group of fundamental particles is to abandon the notion of permutation symmetry of fermions and bosons .",
    "the representation theory of the classical groups is closely linked with the group of permutation of @xmath5 objects .",
    "therefore , the concepts of anti - symmetry of wavefunctions under the permutation of pairs of fermions and symmetry under the permutation of pairs of bosons , can be incorporated naturally , using anti - symmetric and symmetric tensor representations of the classical groups .",
    "this device is not natural within the representation theory of quantum groups . here",
    "the permutation group is replaced by its deformed version ; the braid group @xcite .",
    "the braid group @xmath6 deals with the permutation of @xmath5 strings , and in general can be very complex .",
    "the relevant braid group that we are concerned with in this paper , satisfies a quadratic relationship ( skein relation ) : b_ij^2+(q^2 - 1)b_ij = q^2 where @xmath7 , tangles two strands @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this , replaces the simple quadratic relationship of permuting two objects @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a row of @xmath5 objects ; @xmath10 .",
    "it is clear that the relation ( 1.1 ) reduces to the permutation relation in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "if we postulate that the physical states are eigenstates of @xmath11 rather than @xmath12 , then we will have no choice other than letting bosons correspond to an eigenstate with the unit eigenvalue and fermions to the eigenstate with the eigenvalue equal to @xmath13 .",
    "here we face a problem , that the octet states are not the eigenstates of the braid matrix ; the operation of @xmath11 on these states will not leave them invariant .",
    "thus the deformation of flavour alone can not be permitted , so we conclude that deforming another subspace such as spin is necessary @xcite",
    ".    the paper is organised as follows : in sec.2 we give a brief introduction to quantum groups , construct the q - deformed states of the flavour space , and then together with the q - deformed spin space , we discuss the effects of the braid group . in the sec.3 , following the standard procedures , we calculate the static parameters of hadrons as functions of q , fitting these calculations with the observed data , we find an interval for q.",
    "every quantum group corresponds to a solution of the yang- baxter equation , and to every solution we can correspond an integrable statistical model @xcite .",
    "there are in fact mathematical relationships between integrable models and quantum groups [ 1 - 2 ] . here",
    "we shall only give a brief discussion of the mathematical structure of the standard deformation of @xmath1 , which will suffice for our calculations .",
    "the commutation relations of @xmath1 algebra are : [ h_i , h_j ] & = & 0 & = & a_ijx_j^&= & _ ij i , j=1,2 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are cartan generators , ladder operators and cartan matrix elements respectively .",
    "this algebra is characterized by hopf algebra structure ; the coproduct @xmath17 , coidentity @xmath18 and antipode @xmath19 are defined as @xcite : h_i & = & h_i1 + 1h_i x_i^ & = & q^-h_i/2x_i^+x_i^q^h_i/2 ( 1)x_i^ & = & q^-h_i/2q^-h_i/2x_i^+q^-h_i/2x_i^ q^h_i/2 & & + x_i^q^h_i/2q^h_i/2 ,    \\(1 ) = 1 & ( h_i)= 0 & ( x_i ) = 0 s(1)=1 & s(h_i)=-h_i & s(x_i^)=-q^h_i/2x^q^-h_i/2 .",
    "choosing @xmath16 accordingly , one obtains the standard deformation of the relevant lie algebra .",
    "representations of quantum groups can be constructed by similar routes to the undeformed version .",
    "we are concerned here with the fundamental representations .    for @xmath0 algebra",
    "the matrix representations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are : & h = & x^+ = & & x^- = and for @xmath22 : h_1 & = & & h_2 & = & x_1^+ & = & & x_1 ^ - & = & x_2^+ & = & & x_2 ^ - & = & .",
    "hadrons are made of three quarks each of which can occur in three types of flavours ( up , down , strange ) , 3 33 = 3(6|3)= 10_s 8_ms 8_ma 1_a .",
    "so there are 27 possible combinations which can be separated into totally symmetric ( @xmath19 ) , mixed - symmetric ( @xmath23 ) , mixed - antisymmetric ( @xmath24 ) and totally antisymmetric ( @xmath25 ) states . by applying the ladder operators @xmath15 to the highest weight of these 27 states(@xmath26 ) with the use of the coproduct ( 2.3 )",
    ", we construct the 27 q - deformed states of flavour space . here",
    "we only give an example for each @xmath19 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 states in flavour space .",
    "now consider the statistics of these particles .",
    "the permutation operator is defined as : p_12 a > b > & = & b > a > p_12 ^ 2 & = & 1 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the states of 2 identical particles and the eigenvalues are @xmath29,for @xmath19 and @xmath25 states .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath30 are : ab>^+ & = & ( a > b>+ b > a > ) ab>^- & = & ( a > b>- b > a > ) .",
    "the system containing @xmath31 identical particles is either totally symmetric under the interchange of any pair ; the eigenvalue of @xmath32 for them is @xmath33 ( bosons ) , or totally antisymmetric , with the eigenvalue @xmath34 ( fermions ) , p_ij a_1 ... a_i ... a_j ... > & = & ( + 1 ) a_1 ... a_j ... a_i ... > for bosons p_ij a_1 ... a_i ... a_j ... > & = & ( -1 ) a_1 ... a_j ... a_i ... > for fermions",
    ". however all of the q - deformed flavour states are not eigenstates of @xmath12 , in fact they are eigenstates of the braid operator @xmath11 . to maintain a meaningfull deformation there does not seem to be a choice other than letting particle states to be eigenstates of the braid operator . this changes our notion of fermions and bosons .",
    "braids are made of @xmath5 points on a line that are connected by @xmath5 strings to @xmath5 point on another parallel line ( fig .",
    "1.a ) . with the operation @xmath35 , @xmath36",

    "the braid group @xmath6 , is composed of all the tangling moves possible on this structure . in general",
    "the group @xmath6 has infinite size , unless its generators satisfy some polynomial relationship ; the skein relation .",
    "the skein realtion offers a way of untangling a braid . for our case ,",
    "the skein relation ( 1.1 ) is equivalent to the fig .",

    "fortunately , the tower of braided states due to the skein relation ( 1.1 ) , does not extend indefinitely .",
    "now for example , the symmetric state of @xmath46 under the exchange of the first two quarks becomes : b_12 ^+ > & = & b_12 ( ) ( uud+qudu+q^2duu ) & = & ( ) [ uud+q(1-q^2)udu+q^2duu+q^3udu ] & = & ( + 1 ) ( ) ( uud+qudu+q^2duu ) & = & ( + 1 ) ^+ > and in the only anti - symmetric state ; @xmath47 this exchange of the first two quarks gives : b_12 ^o_1 > & = & b_12 ( ) [ ( sdu - qsud)+(q^2usd - qdsu)+(q^2dus - q^3uds ) ] & = & [ qdsu - q^2usd+q^2(1-q)-q^2sdu    & & + q^3uds - q^3(1-q^2)uds - q^4dsu ] & = & ( -q^2 ) ( ) [ ( sdu - qsud)+(q^2usd - qdsu)+(q^2dus - q^3usd ) ] & = & ( -q^2 ) ^o_1>. therefore , although the state @xmath46 can be interpreted as symmetric , this is not the case for @xmath48 .",
    "so we are led to require this unorthodox interpretation of permutation of identical subsystems of a bound state .",
    "this is a fundamental change of our notions , but seems inevitable if quantum groups are to find physical relevance .",
    "this led us to proceed with this proviso in mind and look at the physical consequences of this construct .",
    "now we see that a hadron state like proton ; @xmath49,in which the state is constructed by a combination of @xmath23 and @xmath24 states , can not be an eigenstate of braid matrix .",
    "this problem leads us to conclude that the deformation of only one subspace is not enough , that another subspace has to be deformed .",
    "spin space seems to be the best choice among the others .",
    "tables 1 , 2 and 3 show the deformed states for spin and flavour states .    finally the permutaion matrix is defined as follows : = p_space b_spin b_flavour p_colour where the indices define the space on which these operators act . here",
    "@xmath50 has the eigenvalues of @xmath38 and @xmath51 for the @xmath19 and @xmath25 states respectively .",
    "so again we will have @xmath52 as the eigenvalues of the total permutation matrix .",
    "we also note that @xmath53 is a unitary matrix , and an expectation value of an obsevable like @xmath25 for a particle with the state @xmath27 , can have a unitary transfomation under @xmath53 : < a a a > = < a a a>.",
    "the wave - function of a hadron has to be antisymmetric because , quarks are fermions and the wave - function is written as : > = space , spin > flavour > colour>. the spape - spin wave function can be separated if the model is non - relativistic [ 15,16 ] .",
    "it s usual to take the colour state totally antisymmetric , so the rest should be totally symmetric . for hadrons",
    "we have to consider a combination of @xmath23 and @xmath24 states which finally is totally symmetric : > = ( _ ms . _",
    "ms + _ ma . _ ma ) colour > , where @xmath54 s and @xmath55 s are the wave functions of space - spin and flavour respectively .",
    "the static parameters that we have calculated are the magnetic moment @xmath56 @xcite , axial form factor @xmath57 @xcite and bjorken sum - rule @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the static parameters are : g_a & = & u - d & or & g_a & = & _ i=1 ^ 3 _ i^3 _ i^3g_1^p - g_1^n & = & ( u + d ) and = _ i=1 ^ 3 o_i(x_i,_i ) e_i where < o_i > & = & a < o_i > & = & -a in which @xmath8 sums over the three quarks , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the spin and the isospin in the @xmath61 direction of each of them respectively and @xmath56 is the magnetic moment of the hadron with `` a '' as a number depending on the model we use . here @xmath62 is the quark asymmetry , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the probability of finding a u ( d ) quark with spin polarized ( unpolarized)to the spin of proton .",
    "we have calculated these parameters for hadrons by using the wave function ( 3.21 ) and the states of the tables 1 and 3 . in theory , for calculating the magnetic moments , it is convenient to find them with respect to magnetic moment of neutron . we have compared the results with the experimental data [ 17,18 ] and found two least square error(lse ) functions for magnetic moments and sum rules as follows respectively : lse(mm)&=&_i=1 ^ 5 [ ( _ i(q)/(q)_neutron-_i^exp /_neutron^exp)/(_i^exp/_neutron^exp)]^2 lse(sr)&=&_i=1 ^ 4 [ ( g_i(q)-g_i^exp)/(g_i^exp)]^2 where @xmath8 sums over the particles and @xmath17 s are the experimental errors . for the magnetic moments we have only 5 fuctions because , the magnetic moment found for @xmath65 is the same as of the @xmath5 and the @xmath66 particle is an unstable one .",
    "the experimental results for magnetic moments are more acurate than the sum rules , therefore we have only used the results of lse(mm ) .",
    "the curve is shown at the end of the paper .",
    "as it shows , it has two minimums in @xmath67 .",
    "now we give an example of how we found the static parameters in functions of @xmath68 , the wave function of proton is : p > & = & [ q(1+q^2 ) udu - q^4 udu- duu & & + q(1+q^2 ) duu- udu - q duu+ q(1+q^2 ) uud & & -q uud - q^3 uud ] here the @xmath69,@xmath70 stands for spin up or down of the particle .",
    "next we calculate the expectation value of the magnetic moment operator giving the following result : < pp > = ( ) [ ] @xmath71 is the mass of quark .",
    "the curious thing is that the expectation function of @xmath57 for the proton is different from neutron , u & = & d & = & 2.5 cm all for proton g_a & = & g_1^p - g_1^n & = & and u & = & d & = & 2.5 cm all for neutron g_a & = & g_1^p - g_1^n & = & , and all in @xmath72 give the undeformed results .",
    "the values obtained for q are inverse of eachother , and this shows that as we have expected , the algebra is invariant under the exchange of @xmath73 . from the exact symmetry of spin , we also have expected that the values for q should be near 1 ; @xmath2 . note also that although the permutation group was deformed , the concept of fermions and bosons remains intact at the level of hadrons , if we deform spin space too .",
