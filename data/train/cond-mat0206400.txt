    "systematic series expansions for statistical models defined on a lattice are a well - known method to study phase transitions and critical phenomena @xcite . they provide an useful complement to large - scale numerical simulations , in particular for quenched , disordered systems where the average over many different disorder realizations is numerically very time consuming and only some points in the vast parameter space of the systems can be sampled with realistic effort .",
    "using high - temperature series expansions , on the other hand , one can obtain for many quantities results which are exact up to a certain order in the inverse temperature . here",
    "the infinite - volume limit can be taken without problems and the quenched disorder is treated exactly .",
    "moreover , one can keep the disorder strength @xmath1 as well as the dimension @xmath2 as symbolic parameters and therefore analyse much larger regions of the parameter space of disordered systems . to this end we developed further the method of `` star - graph expansion '' which allows us to take the disorder average on the level of individual graphs exactly and apply it to @xmath0-state potts models with a bimodal quenched distribution of ferromagnetic couplings . using optimized cluster algorithms for the exact calculation of spin - spin correlators on graphs with arbitrary inhomogeneous couplings , we obtained series up to order 18 in the inverse temperature for the susceptibility and the free energy of bond - diluted potts models in two , three and four dimensions .    depending on the dimension @xmath2 and the number of states @xmath0",
    ", pure potts models show first- or second - order phase transitions . according to the harris criterion  @xcite one expects in the second - order case either the appearance of a new random fixed point ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) or logarithmic corrections to the pure fixed point ( @xmath5 , @xmath8 ) . at first - order transitions",
    ", randomness softens the transitions . for @xmath5 even infinitesimal disorder induces a continuous transition  @xcite , whereas for @xmath7 , @xmath9 a tricritical point at a finite disorder strength is expected  @xcite .",
    "this softening to a second - order phase transition beyond a tricritical point at some finite disorder strength has recently been verified in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the three - dimensional _ site_-diluted 3-state  @xcite and _ bond_-diluted 4-state  @xcite potts model .",
    "the critical part of the series expansion methods lies in the extrapolation techniques which are used in order to obtain information on the critical singularity from a finite number of known coefficients of the high - temperature series .",
    "one can question the use of these extrapolation techniques in disordered systems , where the complete singularity structure of the function may be very complicated , involving griffiths - type singularities or logarithmic corrections  @xcite .",
    "anyhow , we are able to determine the transition temperature for the bond - diluted 4-state potts model in three dimensions reliably up to the vicinity of the geometrical percolation point and in good agreement with analytic estimates  @xcite and mc results  @xcite .",

    "they show an effective exponent monotonically increasing with @xmath1 but reaching a plateau at @xmath110 for dilutions between @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the following sharp increase is to be interpreted as due to the crossover to the percolation fixed point @xmath113 , @xmath114 , where a @xmath115 behavior is expected .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that series analysis in crossover situations is extremely difficult .",
    "if the parameter @xmath1 interpolates between regions governed by different fixed points , the exponent obtained from a finite number of terms of a series expansion must cross somehow between its universal values , and does this usually quite slowly .",
    "therefore it does not come as a surprise that the mc simulations quoted above see the onset of a second order phase transition already for smaller values of the disorder strength @xmath1 .",
    "the mere existence of a plateau in @xmath116 , however , is an indication that here truly critical behavior is seen .",

    "we have implemented a comprehensive toolbox for generating and enumerating star graphs as required for high - temperature series expansions of quenched , disordered systems .",
    "monte carlo simulations of systems with quenched disorder require an enormous amount of computing time because many realizations have to be simulated for the quenched average .",
