    "despite the fact that agn have been studied for several decades now , there are still many unanswered questions , among which the agn triggering mechanism , the duration of the agn activity , their accretion history and spectral evolution ( if any ) following this history .",
    "an important issue steams from the fact that agn appear in a great variety of forms ( for instance seyferts of type 1 and 2 , and liners , etc ) , which raises the question of whether all these objects are intrinsically different or just different phases of the same phenomenon .",
    "are these phases related to the accretion rate ?",
    "are these the same kind of objects in a different evolutionary stage , determined by the amount of material falling into the nucleus ?",
    "an additional question is the relation of agn and circumnuclear bursts of star formation ( the so - called starburst galaxies ) .",
    "currently , the dominant paradigm for agn is that the different spectral properties that define the different types , especially the different types of seyferts , correspond to different orientations between the circumnuclear dust torus around the accretion disk , which feeds the black hole , and the line of sight ( eg .",
    "antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 )    if however there are intrinsic physical differences , then an important task would be to identify the cause of such differences . could they be due to differences of the host galaxies or possibly due to different environmental effects ? during the last decade",
    "many studies have dealt with the environment of agn , from a few kpcs around the galactic nucleus to some hundreds of kpcs around the host galaxy .",
    "these studies were aimed at clarifying whether there is any difference ( 1 ) between the environment of active and non - active galaxies and ( 2 ) between different types of agn .",
    "some studies suggest no relation between environmental effects and nuclear activity ( virani , de robertis , van dalfsen 2000 ; schmitt 2001 and references therein ) . also , there seems to be no differences in their detailed morphology or any other physical property between the agn hosts and non - active galaxies ( virani , de robertis , van dalfsen 2000 ; marquez et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "these results point against a scenario in which nearby galaxies trigger nuclear activity .",
    "other studies however claim the opposite ( eg .",
    "dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1999 ; storchi - bergmann et al . 2001 ; chatzichristou 2002 ; sanchez and gonzalez - serrano 2003 ; marquez et al .",
    "2003 ) . moreover , there are indications that the environment of different types of agn differ with type 2 objects , showing a larger fraction of companions ( eg .",
    "laurikainen & salo 1995 ; dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1999 ; krongold , dultzin - hacyan , marziani 2001 ; chatzichristou 2002 ; krongold , et al . 2003 ; hunt & malkan 2004 ; kelm , focardi & zitelli 2004 ) , thus posing problems to the simplest version of the unification model .    in this work we use the exact same samples of dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1999 ( hereafter dh99 ) to study the three - dimensional environment of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies .",
    "the first part of our analysis is based on computing the fraction of our active or non - active galaxies that have a neighbor within some given conditions.to this end we use the center for astrophysics ( cfa2huchra/ ] ; huchra , geller , corwin 1995 ; huchra , vogeley , geller 1999 ) and the southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs ; da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) galaxy catalogues , which have a magnitude limit , in the @xmath8-zwicky system ( huchra 1976 ) of @xmath9 .",
    "the second part is based on our own spectroscopic observations of all projected neighbors within a 100 @xmath2 kpc radius around a subsample of our agn and down to @xmath10 .",
    "the final part of our study is an analysis of the large scale environment of the different types of seyfert galaxies .",
    "we will discuss our galaxy samples in section  2 .",
    "our data analysis and results will be presented in3 , while in section  4 we discuss our results and present our conclusions . due to the fact that all our samples are local , cosmological corrections to the galaxy distances are negligible . throughout our paper",
    "we use @xmath11 mpc .",
    "the samples of the two type of seyfert galaxies were compiled from the catalog of lipovetsky , neizvestny & neizvestnaya ( 1988 ) .",
    "they consist of 72 sy1 galaxies with redshifts between 0.007 and 0.036 and 69 sy2 galaxies with redshifts between 0.004 and 0.020 .",
    "the samples are volume limited as indicated from the @xmath12 test and complete to a level of 92% .",
    "they include only high galactic latitude objects in order to avoid extinction and confusion with galactic stars .",
    "the sample selection details are described in dh99 .",
    "note however that we have re - examined and re - assigned the seyfert classification of each agn in these samples in order to take into account relevant recent studies and indeed we have changed the classification for about 10% of the original ones .",
    "we also use the two control samples , compiled by dh99 in such a way as to reproduce the main characteristics , other than the nuclear activity , of the agn samples .",
    "specifically , the control samples were compiled from the original cfa catalog to reproduce closely the redshift , morphological type and diameter size distributions of the corresponding agn samples .",
    "the latter was imposed due to the fact that seyfert galaxies often reside in giant hosts which tend not to be isolated .",
    "the magnitude distributions were not matched since agn are typically brighter due to their nuclear activity .",
    "therefore matching the magnitudes would introduce a strong bias if a correction for the luminosity of the agn source is not applied ( see discussion by de robertis , hayhoe , yee 1998a and de robertis et al .",
    "in other words , the selection of the two seyfert and their corresponding control samples are exactly the same , with the only difference being the nuclear activity .",
    "this is very important in order to validate that any possible environmental effect is related to the nuclear activity and not to sample biases or possible differences in the host galaxies .    in table 1",
    "we present the names , celestial coordinates , zwicky magnitudes and redshifts of our final list of agn galaxies that reside within the area covered by the cfa2 and ssrs catalogues .      in order to investigate the local and large scale environment around our active and control sample galaxies we use the cfa2 and ssrs galaxy catalogues which cover a large solid angle of the sky .",
    "although these galaxy catalogues date from the 80 s and 90 s they still provide an important database for studies of the properties of galaxies and their large - scale distribution in the nearby universe . we briefly present the main characteristics of these catalogues .    the cfa2 redshift catalog contains approximately 18000 galaxy redshifts in the northern sky down to a magnitude limit of @xmath1315.5 ( huchra 1990 ) .",
    "the magnitude system used is the merging of the original zwicky magnitudes and the more accurate rc1 @xmath8 magnitudes .",
    "these exhibit a scatter of @xmath14 mags ( eg . bothun & cornell 1990 ) .",
    "following huchra et al . , we do not attempt to translate these magnitudes to a standard photometric system since this requires accurate knowledge of the morphological type and size of each individual galaxy .    the ssrs catalog ( da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) contains redshifts , @xmath15 magnitudes and morphological classifications for @xmath165400 galaxies in two regions covering a total of 1.70 steradians in the southern celestial hemisphere and it is more than 99% complete down to @xmath17 = 15.5 .",
    "the galaxies have positions accurate to about 1 arcsec and magnitudes with an rms scatter of about 0.3 mag .",
    "the radial velocity precision is of @xmath16 40 km / s .",
    "note that in the regions covered by the ssrs and cfa2 catalogues , only a subsample of the original agn and their control samples can be found ( 48 sy1 , 56 sy2 , 47 sy1-control and 41 sy2-control galaxies ) .",
    "in order to test whether these subsamples are statistically equivalent with their parent samples ( ie . , their diameter , morphological type and redshift distributions ) we used kolmogorov - smirnov two - sample tests .",
    "we verified that the null hypothesis , that the subsamples are equivalent with their parent samples , can not be rejected at any significant statistical level .      in figure 1",
    "we plot the magnitude distributions of the sy1 ( class 1 to 1.5 included ) and the sy2 ( class @xmath18 ) galaxies .",
    "it is evident that the distribution of sy1 magnitudes peaks closer to the ssrs & cfa2 magnitude limit than that of the sy2s by on average @xmath19 .",
    "this effect is introduced by the fact that the sy2s have a lower redshift distribution than the sy1s .",
    "although , this bias will not affect the comparison between seyfert and their control samples , it could affect the comparison between the two seyfert samples .",
    "furthermore , in order to reconcile such a magnitude difference between the two seyfert samples and to validate our analysis we have also decided to go fainter by obtaining our own spectroscopic observations of fainter neighbors around a subsample of our agns , consisting of 22 sy1 and 22 sy2 galaxies ( selected randomly from their parent samples ) . around these agn",
    "we have obtained spectra of all neighboring galaxies within a projected radius of 100 @xmath2 kpc and a magnitude limit of @xmath5 .",
    "optical spectroscopy was carried out using the faint object spectrograph and camera ( lfosc ) ( zickgraf et al .",
    "1997 ) mounted on the 2.1 m guillermo haro telescope in cananea , mexico , operated by the national institute of astrophysics , optics and electronics ( inaoe ) .",
    "a setup covering the spectral range @xmath20  with a dispersion of 8.2 / pix was adopted .",
    "the effective instrumental spectral resolution was about 15 .",
    "the data reduction was done using the iraf packages and included bias and flat field corrections , cosmic rays cleaning , wavelength linearization , and flux transformation . in table 2",
    "we present the agn name , coordinates , redshifts and magnitudes for this restricted sample of agn as well as for all their neighbors , within a projected separation of 100 @xmath2 kpc .    below the row of each seyfert we list the corresponding data for its neighbors .",
    "since zwicky magnitudes were not available for the fainter neighbors and in order to provide a homogeneous magnitude system for all the galaxies we decided to list in table 2 the @xmath21 magnitudes ( blue ) poss i plate magnitudes of the minnesota automated plate scanner ( maps ) system .",
    "] for all galaxies , being the central agn or their neighbors ( see http://aps.umn.edu/ docs / photometry ) . for the neighbors of the agn galaxies we present in the fifth column our measured redshifts ( while in some very few cases we list the redshift from the ned ) .",
    "the uncertainties listed are estimated from the redshift differences which result from using more than one emission line .",
    "we search for the nearest neighbor of each seyfert and control galaxy in our samples with the aim of estimating the fraction of active and non - active galaxies that have a close neighbor .",
    "to define the neighborhood search we use two parameters , the projected linear distance ( @xmath22 ) and the radial velocity separation ( @xmath23 ) between the central agn and the neighboring galaxies found in the cfa2 and ssrs catalogues or in our own spectroscopic observations .",
    "we search for neighbors with @xmath24 600 km / s , which is roughly the mean galaxy pairwise velocity of the cfa2 and ssrs galaxies or about twice the mean pairwise galaxy velocity when clusters of galaxies are excluded ( marzke et al . 1995 ) .",
    "note however that our results remain robust even for @xmath24 1000 km / s .",
    "we then define the fraction of active and non - active galaxies that have their nearest neighbor , within the selected @xmath23 separation , as a function of increasing @xmath22 .      in figure 2",
    "we plot the fraction of seyfert and control galaxies that have a close companion , as a function of the projected distance ( @xmath22 ) of the first companion .",
    "we present results for @xmath26 km / s ( left panel ) and @xmath27 km / s ( right panel ) .",
    "it is evident that the sy1 galaxies and their control sample show a consistent fraction of objects having a close neighbor ( within the errors ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a significantly higher fraction of sy2 galaxies having a near neighbor within @xmath28 h@xmath29 kpc with respect to both their control sample and the sy1 galaxies .",
    "this confirms previous results based on a two dimensional analysis ( dh99 ) .",
    "the fact that the redshift distribution of our sy1 galaxies peaks at a higher redshift than that of our sy2 galaxies imposes the sy1 magnitudes to be relatively closer to the magnitude limit of the cfa2 and ssrs catalogues ( by @xmath16 0.6 mags ) .",
    "therefore , we may be missing near companions of the sy1 galaxies which are fainter than this magnitude limit .",
    "although this possible bias does not influence the comparison between the seyfert and their respective control sample ( since both have the same redshift distribution ) , it could be that sy1 galaxies have typically fainter companions than sy2 galaxies .    to investigate this possibility",
    "we have performed , as discussed in section 2 , a spectroscopic survey of all neighbors with @xmath30 ( @xmath163 magnitudes fainter than the cfa2 and ssrs limits ) .",
    "this limit translates into an absolute magnitude limit of m@xmath3116.5 for the most distant objects in our sample ( z@xmath32 ) .",
    "this magnitude is similar to the one of the small magellanic cloud .",
    "we have searched for neighbors within a projected distance of @xmath33 kpc , around each agn for a subsample of our original sy1 and sy2 galaxies .    in the left panel of figure 3",
    "we plot the magnitude difference ( @xmath34 ) between the central agn and its nearest cfa2/ssrs neighbor ( within @xmath35 kpc and for @xmath36 km / s ) as a function of the agn magnitude .",
    "circular and square points represent sy2 and sy1 galaxies , respectively .",
    "the thick dashed line delineates the limit below which we can not observe neighbors due to the magnitude limit of the cfa2/ssrs galaxies .",
    "some interesting information can be extracted from this plot :    1 .",
    "the nearest neighbor galaxy is typically fainter than the active galaxy itself , 2 .",
    "some of the nearest neighbors are as bright or even brighter than the seyfert galaxy , a fact which needs further study in order to test whether such neighbors host an agn as well , 3 .",
    "the excluded region , due to the sample magnitude limit , increases with agn magnitude and thus for @xmath37 we maybe missing faint neighbors .",
    "here we present results of our spectroscopic observations of all the neighbors with @xmath30 and @xmath39 kpc for a random subsample of 22 sy1 and 22 sy2 galaxies ( see section 2 ) .",
    "we use this projected separation limit since the significant difference between the sy2 s and their control sample is found within such limit ( see figure 2 ) .    in the right panel of figure 3",
    "we plot the magnitude difference , @xmath34 , between the central agn and its nearest neighbor ( within @xmath36 km / s and @xmath39 kpc ) against the agn magnitude . for consistency",
    "we have used approximate zwicky @xmath15 magnitudes for the neighbors ( although in table 2 we list only the @xmath40 maps magnitudes ) .",
    "the additional close neighbors that we identified by our spectroscopy are depicted with filled symbols .",
    "the thick solid line represents the new @xmath41 magnitude limit , below which we have no data .",
    "the open symbols correspond to neighbors found also by the previous @xmath42 analysis , based on the cfa2 and ssrs catalogues .",
    "it is evident that our spectroscopic observations help to fill the gap in the region where a possible bias could be introduced by the magnitude limit of the cfa2 and ssrs catalogues . in detail",
    "we find that 10 more seyferts have close neighbors , 6 of which are sy2s and 4 are sy1s .",
    "thus , the fraction of agn with companion down to this new magnitude limit ( @xmath43 ) is 27% ( @xmath44 ) and 55% ( @xmath45 ) for sy1s and sy2s , respectively ( as compared to 14% @xmath46 and 27% @xmath44 for magnitude limit @xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore when we go fainter in magnitude the fraction of sy1 and sy2 galaxies with a close companion increases by about the same factor for both types of agn .",
    "this implies that our original analysis , presented in section 3.1 , is still valid and the relevant conclusions remain unaltered .    in figure 4",
    "we also plot for our restricted agn sample the frequency distribution of seyfert galaxies , in bins of @xmath48 kpc width , having their nearest neighbor within the radial distance and projected separation indicated , when the magnitude limit drops to @xmath10 . the first bin ( below @xmath49kpc )",
    "shows the fraction of isolated agn .",
    "the excess of companions for sy2s with respect to sy1s is again evident .    finally , it is useful to compare our results with the 2-dimensional analysis of dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who found that the percentages of sy1 and sy2 having a close neighbor in projection ( down to the limiting magnitude of the poss ; @xmath50 ) were 40% and 70% respectively .",
    "note that these percentages are higher than those obtained from the 3-dimensional analysis due to the unavoidable projection effects .",
    "indeed , we find that only 45% of the total number of companion galaxies within a projected distance of @xmath6 kpc of the central galaxy are true 3-dimensional neighbors with a radial velocity separation of @xmath51 .      here",
    "we investigate whether there are differences in the large scale environment of sy1 , sy2 and their control galaxies . to this end",
    "we count all neighboring galaxies , @xmath52 , around each agn and control sample galaxy within a projected radius of 1 @xmath2 mpc , while to take into account the galaxy peculiar velocities , we use a radial velocity separation of @xmath53 km / s .",
    "we estimate the expected cfa2 and ssrs field galaxy density at the distance of each agn by integrating the corresponding luminosity function : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the cfa2 or ssrs luminosity function ( marzke , huchra & geller 1994 ; da costa et al .",
    "1994 ) and @xmath56 is the minimum luminosity that a galaxy can have in order to be included in the galaxy catalogue with the specific magnitude limit ( in our case @xmath47 ) .",
    "we then compute the local overdensity around each agn , within the previously mentioned cylinder , which is given by : @xmath57 with @xmath58 the corresponding volume of the cylinder .    in figure 5",
    "we plot the overdensity frequency distribution for the sy1 ( left panel ) and for the sy2 galaxies ( right panel ) with the corresponding distributions of control sample galaxies .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that there is no statistically significant difference between the agn and their respective control sample distributions .",
    "however , we do find a modest significant difference , at a 0.09 level , between the overdensity distributions of sy1s and sy2s , as well as between their two respective control samples .",
    "this result implies that there is a difference in the environment of the corresponding host galaxies .",
    "if , as suggested by previous works ( hunt & malkan 1999 ) and by our sample , sy1s tend to live in earlier type galaxies than sy2s , then this result can be easily explained , since it is well known that early type galaxies are more clustered than late type ones ( eg .",
    "willmer , da costa & pellegrini 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "we have studied the local and large scale environment of seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies by comparing with well defined control samples , selected in such a way as to reproduce the redshift , morphological type and diameter size of the individual seyfert samples .",
    "to this end we have refined the samples used by dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a similar 2-dimensional analysis and searched for close neighbors around each agn and control sample galaxy using the distribution of cfa2 and ssrs galaxy catalogues as well as our own spectroscopic observations reaching a fainter magnitude limit ( but for a restricted subsample of agns ) .",
    "we have found that the fraction of sy2 galaxies having a close neighbor , within a projected separation of 75 @xmath2 kpc and radial velocity difference up to @xmath53 km / s , is significantly higher than the corresponding fraction of its control sample and that of sy1 galaxies .",
    "the relevant sy1 fraction is statistically equivalent with that of its control sample of non - active galaxies .",
    "this result is in accordance with some previous studies ( eg .",
    "laurikainen & salo 1995 ; dh99 ) .",
    "the difference between the local environment of sy1 and sy2 galaxies , revealed in the present and previous studies , poses a challenge to the simplest form of the unification scheme for these kind of objects .",
    "a possible interpretation is that we see some obscured sy1s galaxies as sy2s _ due to interaction _ : a strong interaction with a comparably sized companion could enhance the overall star formation and drive molecular gas towards the center of the galaxy , which in turn may obscure the active nucleus broad line region .",
    "however , the physical relation between interaction and nuclear activity is still not well clarified .",
    "krongold et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have suggested a possible evolutionary agn sequence driven by interaction and going from starbursting systems to type 2 seyferts , and eventually to type 1s ( see their article for details ) .",
    "further evidence supporting this scenario is given by storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and tran ( 2003 ) .",
    "the evolutionary sequence could be independent of the agn luminosity , since an analogous scheme has been proposed for the low luminosity end of agns ( liners ) by krongold et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and for quasars by sanders , surace and ishida ( 1999 ) .",
    "based on the fact that seyfert 1 galaxies are not often found interacting with other galaxies nor do they appear to be highly disturbed objects , krongold et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that type 1 activity can be detected only 0.1 gyrs after the interaction took place .",
    "we have also found a difference in the large - scale environments of sy1 and sy2 galaxies , with sy1 preferring more overdense regions that sy2s .",
    "however , since the same difference is present in their respective control samples , we conclude that it is not related to their nuclear activity but rather to the different morphological types of their host galaxies .",
    "indeed , we have verified that our sy2 agn are hosted in later type galaxies ( see also malkan , gorjian and tam 1998 ) , which are known to be less clustered than earlier type galaxies ( eg .",
    "willmer , da costa & pellegrini 1998 ) .    summarizing we note that although sy2 galaxies reside in less dense large - scale environments with respect to sy1 galaxies , they do have close companions ( @xmath59 75 @xmath2 kpc , @xmath60 km / s ) much more frequently .",
    "these results present a problem for the simplest formulation of the unification paradigm .",
    "this does not imply that the unification schemes are totally incorrect .",
    "orientation of the host galaxy as well as evolution should play their role .",

    "<S> we present a three - dimensional study of the local ( @xmath0 kpc ) and the large scale ( @xmath1 1 @xmath2 mpc ) environment of the two main types of seyfert agn galaxies . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we use 48 sy1 galaxies ( with redshifts in the range 0.007@xmath30.036 ) and 56 sy2 galaxies ( with 0.004@xmath30.020 ) , located at high galactic latitudes , as well as two control samples of non - active galaxies having the same morphological , redshift , and diameter size distributions as the corresponding seyfert samples . using the center for astrophysics ( cfa2 ) and southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs ) galaxy catalogues ( @xmath4 ) and our own spectroscopic observations ( @xmath5 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that within a projected distance of @xmath6 kpc and a radial velocity separation of @xmath7 km / sec around each of our agns , the fraction of seyfert 2 galaxies with a close neighbor is significantly higher than that of their control ( especially within 75 @xmath2 kpc ) and seyfert 1 galaxy samples , confirming a previous 2-dimensional analysis of dultzin - hacyan et al . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the large - scale environment around the two types of seyfert galaxies does not vary with respect to their control sample galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the seyfert 2 and control galaxy samples do differ significantly when compared to the corresponding seyfert 1 samples . </S>",
    "<S> since the main difference between these samples is their morphological type distribution , we argue that the large - scale environmental difference can not be attributed to differences in nuclear activity but rather to their different type of host galaxies . </S>"
