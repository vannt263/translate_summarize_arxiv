    "finally , the radial extent of the h@xmath0 emitting region depends on the geometry assumed .",
    "if h@xmath0 is emitted in a inclined disc extending from the stellar surface ( assumed spherical ) up to a stelleocentric radius r@xmath24 , then this is given by @xmath42 other possible geometries for the line emitting region -e.g .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a more realistic model would include a range of temperatures and optical depths , although the assumption of a single blackbody temperature should be enough to roughly describe an inner disc emitting an optically thick line such as h@xmath0 .",
    "indeed , a dependence of the previous expression is the temperature characterizing the line emitting region , t@xmath24 . in principle , this is a free parameter that should lie within several thousand @xmath6 for hydrogen to be at least partially ionized . for t@xmath24 = t@xmath5 ,",
    "the total projected lengths of the h@xmath0 emitting region ( @xmath1 2@xmath43 ) should be @xmath1 2.5r@xmath5 for both stars .",
    "this is below the spatial resolution limit of the baselines considered in this work , and therefore consistent with our observations .",
    "higher temperatures would decrease r@xmath24 , whereas only very low , unlikely t@xmath24 temperatures ( @xmath12 4000 @xmath6 ) would allow to spatially resolve the h@xmath0 line emitting region . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that a compact gaseous disc emitting like a blackbody at a temperature of several thousand @xmath6 could in principle be responsible of the h@xmath0 emission for both hd 179218 and hd 141569 .",
    "in addition , a double - peaked line profile like the one shown by hd 141569 is characteristic of keplerian - rotating discs .",
    "the peak emissions are located at around @xmath16 115 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this velocity corresponds to a keplerian distance as close as @xmath1 5r@xmath5 , where uncertainties from the spectral resolution and the error bars for the stellar masses and radii in table [ table : prop ] have also been taken into account .",
    "a homogeneous disc would produce a double - peaked line profile with similar peak intensities , thus the fact that the red peak is less intense than the blue could in principle be explained from differeces in density between both sides of the rotating disc .",
    "however , the h@xmath0 profile of hd 141569 is roughly stable on timescales ranging from several days to almost two decades ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which challenges the keplerian disc as the only explanation for the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "a relatively constant infall of material would cause a redshifted absorption which could explain why the red peak is always less intense than the blue .",
    "the inverse p - cygni feature superimposed on some of the double - peaked h@xmath0 profiles shown in @xcite ( not apparent in our chara observations ) is consistent with this explanation .",
    "given that the inclination estimated for hd 179218 indicates that this system is closer to pole - on ( sect .",
    "[ sect : ma ] ) , a possible keplerian disc could not be reflected by a characteristic double - peaked emission as the one shown by hd 141569 , which is closer to edge - on .",
    "the previous procedure was repeated for the two other haebes resolved by chara in order to test whether their h@xmath0 emission could also be consistent with the blackbody disc model .",
    "[ eq : size ] indicates that the corresponding projected size for ab aur would be @xmath1 0.04 @xmath4 ( 3.2r@xmath5 ) , i.e. an order of magnitude smaller than inferred from chara observations @xcite .",
    "apart from the distance and inclination indicated in this paper , we have assumed the stellar temperature ( = t@xmath24 ) and radius in @xcite and the h@xmath0 parameters in @xcite .",
    "once again , only for unrealistically low t@xmath24 temperatures ( @xmath12 3000 @xmath6 ) the blackbody disc could have been spatially resolved .",
    "regarding mwc 361 , the corresponding projected disc size would be @xmath1 0.08 @xmath4 ( 2.4r@xmath5 ) , which is also an order of magnitude smaller than obtained from chara @xcite .",
    "the data necessary to apply eq .",
    "[ eq : size ] were taken from that paper and from @xcite .",
    "it is noted that in this case h@xmath0 temperatures up to 6000 @xmath6 could make the blackbody disc large enough to be resolved . in conclusion ,",
    "given the small emitting size compared to the one derived from chara , the blackbody disc hypothesis is not consistent with the observed properties of ab aur , in contrast to our target stars .",
    "in the case of mwc 361 , a `` cold '' blackbody disc with a temperature up to @xmath1 6000 @xmath6 could also explain that h@xmath0 is spatially resolved in this object .",
    "a major constraint of the magnetospheric accretion ( ma ) scenario is that the h@xmath0 emission line is generated in the magnetosphere , in magnetically driven flows at a radial distance not further than the co - rotation radius @xcite . for the stellar parameters , projected rotational velocities and inclinations assumed here ( sect .",
    "[ sect : sample ] ) , the co - rotation radii are 2.39 r@xmath5 and 1.36 r@xmath5 for hd 179218 and hd 141569 , well below the radial extent that can be resolved with chara .",

    "* ) , but a general description is included in the following .",
    "the model calculates the atomic level populations of free - falling gas channeled along magnetic field lines in a dipolar , axisymmetric field emerging from the star .",
    "input data are the stellar parameters ( m@xmath5 , r@xmath5 , t@xmath5 ) , the mass accretion rate ( @xmath44 ) , the maximum temperature of the gas ( t@xmath24@xmath45 ) , the inclination ( @xmath46 ) , and the size of the magnetosphere in terms of the minimum and maximum radial distances from which the gas is channelled ( r@xmath47 and r@xmath48 ; see fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar parameters and inclinations used for the modelling are those in table [ table : prop ] , the mass accretion rates were varied within the limits provided by @xcite and @xcite from ma shock modelling ( sect .

    "the h@xmath0 profile observed with chara is plotted with a dotted line and includes the contribution of the photospheric absorption .",

    "<S> this work presents chara / vega h@xmath0 spectro - interferometry ( r @xmath1 6000 , and @xmath2/2b @xmath1 1 @xmath3 ) of hd 179218 and hd 141569 , doubling the sample of herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars for which this type of observations is available so far . </S>",
    "<S> the observed h@xmath0 emission is spatially unresolved , indicating that the size of the h@xmath0 emitting region is smaller than @xmath1 0.21 and 0.12 @xmath4 for hd 179218 and hd 141529 ( @xmath1 15 and 16 r@xmath5 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is smaller than for the two other haebes previously observed with the same instrumentation . </S>",
    "<S> two different scenarios have been explored in order to explain the compact line emitting regions . </S>",
    "<S> a hot , several thousand @xmath6 , blackbody disc is consistent with the observations of hd 179218 and hd 141569 . </S>",
    "<S> magnetospheric accretion ( ma ) is able to reproduce the bulk of the h@xmath0 emission shown by hd 179218 , confirming previous estimates from ma shock modelling with a mass accretion rate of 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 , and an inclination to the line of sight between 30 and 50@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0 profile of hd 141569 can not be fitted from ma due to the high rotational velocity of this object . </S>",
    "<S> putting the chara sample together , a variety of scenarios is required to explain the h@xmath0 emission in haebe stars -compact or extended , discs , accretion , and winds- , in agreement with previous br@xmath11 spectro - interferometric observations .    </S>",
