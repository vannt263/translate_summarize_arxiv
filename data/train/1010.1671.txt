    "bloch oscillations , landau  zener ( lz ) tunneling , and wannier  stark ladders  @xcite , are fundamental quantum effects occurring in a system of electrons moving in a periodic potential and subjected to a constant electric field . due to complications such as impurities , lattice vibrations , and multiparticle interactions ,",

    "einstein condensate atoms out of the ground band in which they were originally prepared . by changing the initial condition and the system parameters and introducing atom - atom interactions into the system , we are able to control the tunneling rate of the bose  einstein condensate to higher bands .",
    "finally a controlled noise added to the system will be shown to be a further handle to engineer the interband tunneling .",
    "we study the temporal evolution of ultracold atoms loaded into a quasi one - dimensional optical lattice which can be a spatially periodic potential or a time - dependent stochastic potential , subjected to an additional static force , in the presence of weak atom - atom interactions  @xcite .",
    "we use the following general form of three - dimensional gross  pitaevskii equation to model the temporal evolution of the atoms @xmath0 with lattice potentials along the longitudinal direction , @xmath1 , as    @xmath2    @xmath3 is the mass of condensate atoms and @xmath4 is the stark force . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are spatially periodic potentials with incommensurate lattice spacings @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . as will be shown below around eq .",

    "lz theory predicts a decay rate @xmath50 where @xmath42 is the adiabaticity parameter and @xmath51  @xcite . in order to study the lz prediction for our system",
    "we need to access the decay rate of the population from the ground band . in that respect , we compute the time - dependence of the probability of the condensate to remain in the ground band in which it has been initially prepared . such a survival probability is best measured in momentum space . from the time - dependent momentum distribution we can determine @xmath52 by projection of the evolved state @xmath53 on to the support of the initial state  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an ad hoc cut - off momentum . in our calculation we chose @xmath56 .",

    "such step structures reflect the above mentioned phenomena , i.e. , bloch oscillations and lz tunneling .",
    "one can see that the tunneling events from the ground band to the next band occur after each bloch period when the wave packet is at the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "it is possible to control the lz tunneling of the bose ",
    "einstein condensate from the ground band in the linear system and in the absence of atom - atom interactions by    * changing the system parameters , such as external force @xmath57 , and the amplitude of the optical lattice @xmath49 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) , * exploiting resonantly enhanced tunneling ( ret ) between degenerate wannier ",

    "as seen in figure  [ fig:1 ] , increasing the tilting force leads to more and more tunneling of the atoms from the ground band . on the other hand , depending on the system parameters , one can tune into a special condition for which the rate of the tunneling is enhanced .",
    "this occurs when an integer multiple of the energy scale of the tilting force @xmath64 matches the energy difference between the initial state and the final state , i.e. , approximately the band gap @xmath47 .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed experimentally  @xcite and is called resonantly enhanced tunneling ( ret ) .",
    "a deviation from the lz prediction is expected in this case . in order to see whether the tunneling probability given by the standard lz tunneling probability correctly predicts the height of a step corresponding to a single tunneling event , we fit a step function to our step - like survival probability and extract the height of each step .",
    "the result and the comparison to the lz prediction is shown in the inset of figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "when the system parameters are in the ret condition ( e.g. , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) , the height of the steps of the survival probability increases and shows a significant deviation from the lz prediction given in eq .  .",
    "this behavior is seen in figure  [ fig:1 ] where the survival probability for @xmath40 decays much faster than for the other two cases . since the derivation of eq .",
    "@xcite does not take into account the actual wannier ",
    "stark level structure , which is necessary to describe the ret condition , eq .   or the survival probability derived from it can not describe the enhancement of the tunneling probability due to ret . + the other parameter which can affect the survival probability is the width @xmath60 of the initial momentum distribution . by changing the trap frequencies",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 one can prepare the initial distribution with different widths .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] demonstrates the dependence of the width of the steps @xmath63 on @xmath60 .",
    "the steps are smooth and partly washed out since the wave packet reaches the edge of the brillouin zone earlier when it has a broader initial momentum distribution .",
    "still the remnants of the steps cause a local deviation from the exponential decay of the tunneling probability .",
    "nevertheless , the survival probability exhibits an exponential decay globally in time , i.e. , on large time scales , for all the mentioned cases .",
    "+      in the regime of weak atom - atom interactions the effect of interactions is studied in the mean - field regime based on the gross  pitaevskii equation . the 3d gross ",
    "pitaevskii equation can describe the dynamics of the entire bose ",
    "einstein condensate in terms of an equation of motion for a single particle wave function .",

    ", we define @xmath72 at the peak density of the initial state .",
    "the following effects can be seen by increasing the strength of a repulsive nonlinearity ( @xmath73 ) in the system :    * enhancement of the tunneling rate , * deviation from mono - exponential decay , * washed out steps ( corresponding to damped bloch oscillations ) .    according to our results shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] for a ret case and the experimental results in  @xcite ,",
    "the temporal behavior of the survival probability depends on the strength of atom - atom interactions .",
    "as can be found with more detail in  @xcite , the enhancement of decay rate is generic for repulsive interactions .",
    "the scaling of the decay rate as a function of nonlinearity is yet more interesting in the ret case ( see the inset of figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we can quantify the decay rate @xmath74 of the survival probability by globally fitting an exponential decay function to the step - like curves of the survival probability .",
    "such rates , for various nonlinearities , are depicted in the inset of figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "a repulsive interaction initially enhances the interband tunneling probability of the ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "since the tunneling events occurring at different integer multiples of the bloch period are correlated by the presence of the nonlinearity , a clear deviation from the mono - exponential decay is observed making the definition of a global decay rate @xmath74 somewhat problematic  @xcite .",
    "a continuous change in the density of the condensate in time due to escaped particles from the system leads to a decreasing impact of the nonlinearity .",
    "therefore , the time local rate of decay systematically decreases as the time increases .",
