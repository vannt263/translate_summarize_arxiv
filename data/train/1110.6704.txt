    "the nucleus - nucleus collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) produced an initial hot and dense matter and this has been interpreted as a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) @xcite .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) opens up opportunities to explore the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in a wider energy region .",
    "the hydrodynamic models are useful tools to describe the hot and dense matter generated in the early stage of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . here , interactions are strong and frequent , so that the microscopic models that assume binary collisions with free propagation of constituents between collisions have limited validity .",
    "the advantage of hydrodynamic models is that one can vary flexibly the dissipative properties and the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter and test its consequences on the reaction dynamics and the outcome .",
    "on the other hand , the initial and final freeze - out ( fo ) stages of the reaction are outside the domain of applicability of the hydrodynamic model .",
    "microscopic models , e.g. the transport model paciae , are quite successful to describe the partonic and hadronic stages of the collision .",
    "unfortunately , the transport models are usually restricted to binary collisions .",
    "thus their validity is limited in the hot and dense matter especially when the qgp is generated .",
    "furthermore , explaining the qgp phase transition between the hadronic and the partonic phase on a microscopic level is also an open issue that still has to be resolved .",
    "recently the so - called hybrid models , combining microscopic and macroscopic modules , have been developed .",
    "there are several hybrid models @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a hybrid model , hydro - paciae , which combines the hydrodynamic model ( hydro code ) and the transport model ( paciae model ) .",
    "the hybrid model connects the different stages of the reaction and each of these are matched @xcite appropriately .",
    "the initial state for hydrodynamic model is constructed based on the so - called effective string rope model @xcite , and considering that the system is close to local equilibrium at high energies .",
    "the subsequent fluid dynamical model assumes a qgp fluid in local equilibrium .",
    "then we consider a transition from the qgp fluid phase to the partonic / hadronic phase , which is described by a combination of a fluid dynamical ( fd ) and a particle transport model , paciae . here",
    "we try to gain more insight into the principles , which may govern these processes .",
    "we use the hybrid model , hydro - paciae , first to simulate the final hadron distribution in pseudo - rapidity and transverse momentum , as well as comparing the model results with the experimental data for au+au collisions at @xmath0=130 gev and pb+pb collisions at @xmath0=2.76 tev .",
    "then we use the hybrid model to calculate the elliptic flow in pb+pb collisions at @xmath0=2.76 tev .",
    "the most essential observables in ultrarelativistic heavy ion reactions @xcite from the laboratory detector can help us to understand the properties of the dense and hot matter . in general , we expect to extract more information from experiments , both on the equation of state ( eos ) and the transport properties of matter @xcite .",
    "we have to apply a realistic and suitable description with fully 3 + 1 dimensional dynamical evolution at all stages of the reaction .",
    "the hydrodynamic stage is calculated by using the particle in cells ( pic ) method @xcite , which uses a mesh of cells with smaller , lagrangian fluid elements in them .",
    "the model assumes the mit bag model equation of state and relativistic perfect fluid .",
    "the total number of so called  marker particles \" ( which are the lagrangian cells ) is about 5 million , and their number remains a constant during a collision .",
    "marker particles are defined to carry the same amount of conserved baryon charge , thus this charge is also exactly conserved by the method .",
    "each cell of the calculational mesh contains a larger number of marker particles , placed in the mesh randomly .",
    "the marker particles move among the cells of the mesh during the fluid dynamical development . as we know",
    ", hydrodynamic models assuming phase and chemical equilibrium during all stages of the reaction can not account for all observations in general .",
    "however , they provide an efficient way to describe the nearly perfect fluid phase of qgp .",
    "then , we transform the fluid in the cells into a set of partons or hadrons , which are then described with the paciae model .    the quark - gluon fluid is assumed to have a small viscosity @xcite , especially in the vicinity of the critical point of the phase transition to / from hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "this phase transition @xcite has significant dynamical effect on the hadronization , that in local , fluid dynamical phase equilibrium takes a long time , which contradicts to observations . to avoid this time delay recently rapid transition scenarios",
    "are assumed , which can be handled well in the hybrid approach .    the 3 + 1 dimensional , relativistic fd model",
    ", we use to describe energetic heavy ion reactions , is well established and describes the measured collective flow phenomena well @xcite . in our computational fluid dynamics ( cfd )",
    "calculation the initial state model is based on expanding flux tubes or streaks @xcite .",
    "it is a system where the matter is stopped within each streak , while streaks expand independently of each other .",
    "thus , this model is applicable streak by streak and the momentum of the streaks varies , especially for the peripheral streaks where the asymmetry between the projectile and target contribution to the participant matter is the biggest .",
    "so , the streaks at the projectile and target sides move in the beam ( @xmath3 ) direction with substantial velocity difference . in the initial state model @xcite the initial transverse velocity is zero for all fluid elements .    in the cfd simulations with the pic solution method @xcite ,",
    "the equations of relativistic fd were solved for a perfect quark - gluon fluid . at the same time the numerical method , due to the finite grid resolution , led to dissipation and thus to entropy production , which was analyzed @xcite . from the entropy production",
    "we could determine the corresponding `` numerical viscosity '' , and this was approximately the same as the estimated , low viscosity of the quark gluon plasma . to avoid double counting , i.e. over counting , of viscous dissipation",
    ", we did not add additional viscous terms to our cfd model simulations .    in case of heavy ion reactions",
    "the flow is not stationary and the shear flow geometry is only present in the initial state .",
    "later , due to the large pressure of qgp the plasma explodes and expands almost radially in a way that the final flow pattern at freeze out is close to spherical , somewhat elongated longitudinally and in the reaction plane ( @xmath4-direction ) due to the dominant elliptic flow .",
    "the paciae model @xcite is a parton and hadron cascade model , which is based on pythia @xcite .",
    "the model consists of four stages : the parton initialization , which decomposes the fluid into partons ; the post transition partonic state consists of quarks , anti - quarks , and gluons ; then , in the parton evolution stage , we are evaluating the total and the differential cross sections arising from the partonic evolution , which can be simulated by the monte carlo method until the parton - parton collisions are ceased ; finally , the partons reach the hadronization at the moment of freeze - out ( fo ) .",
    "this is described by the phenomenological fragmentation model ( string fragmentation ) and the coalescence model @xcite .",
    "after hadronization , the rescattering produces the final hadrons , and we obtain a configuration of hadrons in the spatial and momentum coordinates after the hadronization .",
    "the detailed description for paciae is the following :    1 .",
    "parton initialization : in the case if we start directly from two colliding nuclei , an a+a ( a+b ) collision is decomposed into binary nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions based on the collision geometry , so that every collision time is calculated by assuming that the nucleons propagate along straight line trajectories and interact with the nn inelastic ( total ) cross sections . then the initial nn collision - list is constructed from these nn collisions . a nn collision with the earliest collision time",
    "is selected from the collision list , and the final state of the collision is obtained by the pythia model with string fragmentation switched - off .",
    "afterwards the diquarks ( anti - diquarks ) are broken randomly into quark pairs ( anti - quark pairs ) , and one obtains a configuration of quarks , anti - quarks , and gluons , beside a few hadronic remnants for a nn collision .",
    "+ in case of the hybrid model , we generate partons from the fluid cells of the fd model at a transition hyper - surface .",
    "this is described later .",
    "parton evolution : the evolution is made via parton rescattering , with @xmath5 , binary lo - pqcd differential cross sections @xcite .",
    "then the total and differential cross sections in the parton evolution ( parton rescattering ) are simulated by the monte carlo method .",
    "hadronization : the parton evolution stage is followed by the hadronization at the moment of partonic freeze - out . this means no more parton collisions . in the paciae model , the lund string fragmentation model and phenomenological coalescence model are supplied for the hadronization of partons after rescattering . in case of the hybrid model",
    "the latter one is used .",
    "4 .   after hadronization the rescattering among produced hadrons is dealt with the usual two - body collision model .",
    "only the rescatterings among @xmath6 and their antiparticles are considered in the calculations .",
    "an isospin averaged parametrization formula is used for the @xmath7 cross section @xcite .",
    "we also provide an option for the constant total , elastic , and inelastic cross sections ( @xmath8  mb , @xmath9  mb , @xmath10  mb , @xmath11  mb ) and the assumed ratio of inelastic to total cross section of 0.85 .",
    "we present the connection of the hydrodynamic model and paciae model , as the transfer of the fluid cell by cell to partons , satisfying the conservation laws based on the assumption of the thermal equilibrium before and after the transition .",
    "the detailed steps are as follows :    @xmath12 the hydrodynamic model , assumes a qgp fluid , with an eos given by the mit bag model with massless quarks and gluons and a background field .",
    "each lagrangian fluid cell has a given baryon charge , which are rescaling the charge density in the cells of the mesh , @xmath13 .",
    "we may deal with the transition hyper - surface in @xmath14 optional ways : the first case is the simplest assumption that transition takes place isochronously , @xmath15 at @xmath16 ; the second case is that the transition happens on a hyperboloid , @xmath15 at @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the proper transition time from a space - time point .",
    "the third case is when the transition is described as a sudden change across a space - time hyper - surface , which hyper - surface is calculated based on a condition ( e.g. a transition temperature ) , if the transition condition is known . to be simple , in this work , we choose the first case , in which the direction of the flow and normal vectors are everywhere the same , and they are perpendicular to the transition hyper - surface .      in our simulation ,",
    "the above conservation laws have to be satisfied @xcite and the examination of the increasing entropy should be done during the whole simulation .",
    "for example , baryon charge , @xmath25 , and the energy , @xmath26 , are calculated according to the formula for each cell on the transition hyper - surface : @xmath27 where the index @xmath28 runs over the different generated parton or hadron species .",
    "@xmath29 is the volume of the cell in the local rest frame .",
    "@xmath30 is the post transition 4-velocity , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the 3-velocity of the fluid cell in the partonic or hadronic phase .",
    "note that this velocity after the transition is not the same as the flow velocity of the qgp .",
    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath35 includes the contribution of the particles with their kinetic energies . in the post transition stage ,",
    "particles in partonic matter include quarks , anti - quarks and massless gluons .",
    "the detailes of this transition are described in the appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "@xmath36 we utilize the stefan boltzmann distribution to generate the partons , or jttner distribution to generate the hadrons , considering the strangeness suppression and mass difference in the phase transition .",
    "we give the ratio of generated parton types in equilibrium state with considering the quark masses via the strangeness suppression factor @xmath37 , according to the mass difference of the light quarks and strange quarks at an average transition temperature .",
    "of course , this ratio also affects the momentum distribution for different parton types .",
    "@xmath38 the 4-momenta of the particles are generated according to the cooper - frye formula @xcite .",
    "the baryon chemical potentials for the given baryon number densities are taken into account . as we mentioned above",
    ", we are choosing a time step ( @xmath39 ) , and dispersing the partons into the fluid cells with proper distributions after the hyper - surface .",
    "these steps are done for all fluid cells of the hydro code , which are carrying baryon number density , pressure and momentum .",
    "the created partons serve as parton initialization for the paciae model .",
    "figures [ v_ts138 ] and [ t_ts138 ] show the velocity and temperature change in the transition from the qgp fluid to partonic matter as function of the energy density for different transition time steps , 3.8 fm / c and 5.0 fm / c , in the hydro - paciae hybrid model calculation .",
    "we can see that the cell by cell changes from the qgp fluid to partonic matter are modest except at low energy densities where the velocity and temperature change visibly .",

    "@xcite for the case of pb+pb reactions at lhc energy , and the dependence is similar at lower energies also . in the fd model the calculated charged particle multiplicity , @xmath40 , is a function of fo time ( assuming a @xmath41 fo hyper - surface ) , and of the impact parameter , @xmath42 .",
    "these multiplicities can matched to the measured mean charged multiplicity in a given experimental multiplicity bin .",
    "for example , the impact parameter @xmath43 fm for au+au collisions corresponds approximately to the experimental centrality of 20% and @xmath44 fm for centrality of 40% .",

    "the obtained @xmath46 showed a random statistical fluctuation around zero with a @xmath46-amplitude of 0.1% for @xmath47 , which increased to 0.2% for @xmath48 , due to the smaller charged particle multiplicity at higher pseudorapidities .",

    "the hydro code uses the bag model eos with @xmath52",
    ". however , some of the fluid cells with low internal energy would have negative pressures due to the bag constant , which are set to zero in the model .",
    "thus , we need to calculate the conserved quantities in the transition from qgp to partonic matter both for the cases of positive and zero pressure . first , in the qgp phase , the energy density component and momentum current component , as well as the baryon charge current are as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the energy density in the qgp phase in the calculational frame ( cf ) . in the general case , when the 3-velocity of the fluid is directed arbitrarily , @xmath55 , which is known from the hydro code , then the parton side flow will keep the velocity _",
