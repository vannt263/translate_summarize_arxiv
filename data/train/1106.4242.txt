    "graphene , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) network of @xmath2 carbon atoms forming a honeycomb lattice , is well known for its low - energy electronic excitations . these can be described as dirac - weyl quasi - particles , characterized by a linear spectrum and a chiral nature leading to many of the unusual properties of this new material  @xcite . in the present letter we present yet another unusual effect , arising from the special structure of the rashba hamiltonian for graphene .",
    "we impose a super - lattice of periodically modulated spin - orbit interactions ( sois ) on graphene . as sois interact with the spin degree of freedom , the original su(2 ) structure of the graphene hamiltonian",
    "is modified to a su(2)@xmath0su(2 ) structure . for such super - lattices",
    "it is usually not possible to obtain a simple band equation , unlike in the su(2 ) case , where analytic band equations were already obtained for a large number of different cases  @xcite . despite this , for a lattice momentum along the modulation direction of the soi",
    ", we derive analytic band equations , which look very similar to those obtained for the easier su(2 ) case .",
    "the periodicity length is @xmath3 with @xmath4 the length of the region with soi .",
    "]    graphene has two possible mechanisms of sois : the extrinsic and the intrinsic one .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ soi originates from carbon intra - atomic soi .",
    "it opens a gap in the energy spectrum and converts graphene into a topological insulator with a quantized spin - hall effect  @xcite .",
    "this term has been estimated to be rather weak in clean flat graphene  @xcite . however",
    ", a recent theoretical proposal shows that the presence of indium and thallium adatoms can enhance the gap associated to this effect . even for low coverages of 6% ,",
    "the gap for indium is of the order of 100  k , while for thallium it approaches room temperature  @xcite .",
    "the _ extrinsic _ rashba - like soi originates from interactions with the substrate , presence of a perpendicular external electric field , or curvature of the graphene membrane  @xcite .",
    "a series of recent experiments  @xcite have reported the possibility to control and vary the rashba term by opportune substrate engineering .",
    "a combination of the latter method and a nanomasking technique for controlling the adatom deposition would make variations of both the intrinsic and extrinsic soi strengths feasible on sub - micrometer scales and thus our results applicable for experiments .",
    "modulated soi leads to spin - polarized energy bands : this is essential for realizing graphene - based spintronics devices  @xcite and especially for generating pure spin - currents , using , _",
    "e.g. _ , quantum pumping  @xcite or the spin ratchet effect  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we introduce the spin - dependent transfer matrix ( tm ) method and use it to derive the spin - polarized energy bands in the case of soi modulation .",
    "these simple , analytic band equations allow to directly obtain properties characterizing the band structure , say the band gaps and the dependence on the length of the soi potential .",
    "we use the single valley dirac - weyl hamiltonian  @xcite , which in absence of sois , reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 m s@xmath7 is the fermi velocity , @xmath8 is the vector of pauli matrices associated with the pseudo - spin and @xmath9 the momentum operator in the 2d graphene plane . in the following we use units in which @xmath10 .    as mentioned before two types of sois",
    "are allowed in graphene : the intrinsic and the extrinsic or rashba soi  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic soi hamiltonian is derived from a second nearest neighbor hopping term  @xcite . in the low - energy limit",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a space dependent coupling constant , which can be implemented by appropriate deposition of adatoms . here",
    "@xmath13 is the pauli matrix associated with the spin of the dirac - weyl fermions .",
    "the intrinsic soi does not lift spin degeneracy but opens a gap in the energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "when inversion symmetry is broken , a rashba soi term is possible .",
    "it reads @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is a space dependent coupling .",
    "contrary to @xmath16 this term lifts spin degeneracy but does not open a gap  @xcite .",
    "the single valley model   is valid within the approximation that the length scales of variation of the sois | via the @xmath15 and @xmath12 | are assumed to be much larger than graphene s lattice constant @xmath17  but much smaller than the typical fermi wavelength of quasiparticles @xmath18 . since close to the dirac points @xmath19 , at low energy @xmath20 this approximation is justified .",
    "this assumption ensures that the variation of sois , close to the @xmath21 points , can be approximated as a sharp change .",
    "therefore we choose @xmath12 and @xmath15 to be periodic , piece - wise constant functions which are either zero or have magnitude @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ( c.f .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    in the following we introduce a generalization of the well known tm method  @xcite .",
    "it is valid when the lattice momentum is fixed along the modulation direction and leads to analytic band equations . for general directions of the lattice momentum , as discussed later on , we will consider a different method based on the bloch theorem .",
    "we consider a unit cell of length @xmath3 with a region @xmath24 without soi and a region @xmath4 with finite soi as depicted in fig .  [ fig1 ] . in the @xmath25th unit cell",
    "the wave function @xmath26 can be written as a superposition of the forward ( f ) and backward ( b ) propagating spin up ( @xmath27 ) and spin down ( @xmath28 ) spinor solutions of the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath29 : @xmath30 where we have introduced the vectors of the coefficients in the @xmath25th unit cell @xmath31 .",
    "the tm @xmath32 is the matrix describing the change of the amplitudes of @xmath33 when moving between successive unit cells : @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the matrix of the four component solutions , @xmath32 can be written as  @xcite @xmath36 since @xmath37 obeys the dirac equation , it has a constant determinant , therefore @xmath38=\\det[\\omega(0)^{-1}\\omega(\\ell)]=1 $ ] .",
    "thus , the product of eigenvalues of @xmath32 is one . for a @xmath39 tm , it is useful to specify how the four eigenvalues multiply to one .",
    "because @xmath40 $ ] is constant , we can fix 0 and @xmath41 in regions without sois , where @xmath37 is block diagonal with two sub - blocks which are themselves matrices built of two component spinors of @xmath42 .",
    "as the sub - block matrices are also obeying the dirac equation , their determinants are constant as well .",
    "therefore the eigenvalues of @xmath32 have to multiply to one pairwise . together with the born - von karman requirement @xmath43 |",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath32 must be the @xmath44th root of unity | the band condition can be written as @xmath45,\\label{eq : trace}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the lattice momenta defined by @xmath48 with @xmath49 integer . in order to obtain the r.h.s .",
    "of this equation we need to know explicitly the matrices of spinors outside and inside the soi regions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . with these ,",
    "eq .   can be written as  @xcite @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is a constant 4@xmath544 matrix describing the amplitudes in the @xmath25th unit cell .",
    "this matrix does not enter in the band conditions but cancels during the calculations . in the normal regions",
    "the matrix @xmath55 is : @xmath56 where @xmath57 in the system without soi . here",
    ", @xmath58 is the wavevector outside the soi potential in @xmath59-direction and @xmath20 the energy of the quasiparticles .",
    "finally , @xmath60 is the 2@xmath542 identity matrix in the spin subspace .",
    "note , that the system is translational invariant along the @xmath61 direction . in the sois regions",
    "the matrix @xmath62 reads @xmath63 in the following , @xmath64 refers to the two spin eigenmodes allowed by finite sois , and @xmath65 are their angles of propagation with respect to the @xmath66-axis .",
    "the wavevectors @xmath67 in @xmath66-direction are obtained by evaluating the eigenvalues of @xmath68 for uniform sois and assuming energy conservation and translational invariance along the @xmath61 direction  @xcite .",
    "they are found to read @xmath69 further , we have introduced the spin - dependent factors @xmath70 , and the diagonal matrix @xmath71 $ ] with @xmath72 . calculating the trace explicitly for @xmath73 , the r.h.s .",
    "of eq .   becomes @xmath74= & \\sum_{\\alpha } \\mathcal{f}_\\alpha(k_x ) , \\label{eq : bandsum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath75 here , @xmath67 and @xmath76 are the wavevectors inside and outside of the soi regions , respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath77 function does not depend on terms containing the opposite spin index .",
    "this comes from the fact that , if @xmath32 were unitary , the trace would be the sum of two cosines . if @xmath73 , all matrices building up @xmath32 are unitary except for @xmath62 . in @xmath62",
    "the first two columns correspond to spinors associated with eigenvalues @xmath78 while the second two columns correspond to spinors associated with the eigenvalue @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the first two spinors are orthogonal to the second two but only linearly independent to each other .",
    "also the second two spinors are only linearly independent .",
    "this prevents @xmath32 from being unitary and is the source of the factor in front of the sines in eq .  .",
    "the special form of the four @xmath80 subblocks of @xmath62 for @xmath73 thereby ensures that the sum of the two functions @xmath81 exactly corresponds to the sum of the bands associated with the @xmath78 mode ( plus - band ) and the @xmath79 mode ( minus - band)@xcite .",
    "hence , eq . can be written as two independent equations : @xmath82 this spin - dependent tm method , which leads to a decoupling of the band equation for the case @xmath73 , represents the central analytical results of this work .",
    "we have verified this result by comparing the bands calculated from eq .   with those calculated with the method used for discussing finite @xmath1 in the last section of this letter [ c.f .",
    "in order to understand what happens for systems with periodic sois , let us first review what is known about graphene with uniform sois .",
    "there are three interesting regions in the @xmath83-parameter space : ( i ) @xmath84 , ( ii ) @xmath85 and ( iii ) @xmath86 .",
    "an example of the dispersion relations for uniform sois in these three regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulkcomp]. the energy dispersions associated with @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) are depicted as dashed - blue ( solid - red ) lines .",
    "we denote the wave vector for the uniform case as @xmath87 and the energy in the uniform case as @xmath88 and shortly summarize the features for every case .",
    "panel shows that for case ( i ) the spin degeneracy is completely lifted except for @xmath89 where one of the valence and one of the conduction bands with opposite spin eigenstates touch .",
    "panel shows case ( ii ) in which the intrinsic soi is dominating over the rashba one . in this case",
    "an energy gap opens at @xmath89 where the plus and the minus conduction bands are degenerate . in both cases",
    "the overall behavior shows that the energy dispersions acquire a massive nature . in panel",
    "we show case ( iii ) .",
    "the energy bands of the plus spin state become degenerate at @xmath89 while for the minus spin state there is an energy gap .",
    "importantly , for this case , the plus band keeps its linear dispersion , contrary to the minus band that still displays massive behavior .",
    "now let us compare the dispersion relations for uniform sois to band structures for modulated sois .",
    "the plus(minus)-bands associated with @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) are depicted as dashed - blue ( solid - red ) lines . in the following we use the bloch wavevector @xmath46 instead of @xmath87 . in region",
    "( i ) , shown in panel , there is no gap between the valence plus band and the conduction minus band .",
    "contrary to the case with uniform sois , the two bands cross | the valence band is shifted upwards in comparison to the conduction band .",
    "therefore they now intersect and there is a degeneracy for two opposite and finite values of @xmath46 .",
    "different is also that gaps | although small | open for both bands at the brillouin zone boundaries due to avoided band crossings , as it is usually the case when there is a periodic potential .",
    "the size of these gaps will be estimated later on . in panel",
    "we show region ( ii ) with modulated sois . at @xmath90 the degeneracy of the two spin polarized conduction bands",
    "is lifted because of the different mass terms in the uniform soi case .",
    "the plus valence band goes through @xmath91 and @xmath89 in the uniform case | therefore @xmath92 at this point and the plus valance band has to go through zero energy at @xmath90 in the periodic case as well .",
    "again both bands have gaps at the brillouin zone boundary . for region ( iii ) , shown in panel , this is not the case . due to the linear dispersion of the plus band backscattering",
    "is forbidden and the band is gapless even at the zone boundaries  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in the band eq .   as well . for @xmath86",
    "the prefactor of the sines of the plus band is two and the band factorizes to @xmath93 .",
    "also @xmath94 is a linear function of @xmath20 for this case . concluding this comparison we can say that all general features that we find in the band structure for periodic sois at @xmath73",
    "are understood from the dispersion relation of uniform sois .",
    "as announced before , eq .   enables us to estimate the band gaps at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "always when the expression on the left hand side exceeds modulus two there is a gap in the energy spectrum since the equation has no real valued solution . in order to calculate an approximation for the size of the gaps ,",
    "we follow a perturbative approach on the basis of ref .",
    "first we consider @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the gap in this case is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the leading component of the fourier expansion of the piece - wise constant function modulating the intrinsic soi . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath99 but we obtain a similar solution for @xmath100 .",
    "the band gap for the case without rashba soi is thus approximately @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath102 we can substitute @xmath103 and @xmath104 in eq .  .",
    "up to first order in the expansion parameter @xmath105 this becomes @xmath106 + \\mathcal{o}(b\\lambda)^2 \\notag,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath107 .",
    "the first order term for @xmath108 is rather small and it will never lead to the opening of gaps . actually , when the zeroth order term approaches an extremum as a function of @xmath109 , the first order term approaches zero .",
    "thus it is a reasonable approximation to neglect the first order term .",
    "therefore | in the perturbative approximation | the gaps of the bands for @xmath102 are @xmath110 these values coincide with the numerical results .     on @xmath111 ( upper panel ) and @xmath112 ( lower panel ) for @xmath113 and different @xmath22",
    "the black dashed line refers to the approximation of @xmath114 for large @xmath88 , c.f .",
    "finally we want to examine how the band structure depends on the periodicity length of the sois .",
    "as noticed in @xcite the transmission through a soi barrier depends on the length of the barrier compared to the spin precession length and so does the band structure for periodic sois .",
    "first we derive the spin precession length @xmath114 , which is the length that a carrier needs to cover in order to go back to the initial spin state . in the ballistic limit",
    "the spin - precession length is expressed by @xmath115 . a plot of @xmath114 as a function of @xmath88",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsoplot ] . note that the behavior of @xmath114 is strongly dependent on @xmath22 but the asymptotic value for large @xmath88 is not .",
    "therefore we expand @xmath67 in the limit @xmath116 .",
    "this yields a spin precession length independent of @xmath22 and @xmath88 : @xmath117 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinprec ] the band structure for @xmath118 and the band structure for @xmath119 is shown in panel and respectively . in the first case the plus and",
    "the minus bands lie on top of each other for large energies , where the approximation within @xmath120 was calculated is valid .",
    "this is easily verified by expanding eq .   in the same limit up to first order .",
    "one can show that if @xmath118 for large energies only the pre - factor of the sines in eq .",
    "depends on @xmath121 .",
    "the pre - factor becomes closer and closer to one for increasing @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath122 a similar analysis shows that the band equation depends on @xmath121 | in this case @xmath121 is the overall sign | and the two bands are shifted with @xmath123 in their oscillation .",
    "after a rather complete discussion of the band structures with @xmath73 we turn to the case @xmath124 . as explained before , for this case eq .   is not valid .",
    "hence , for finite angles @xmath1 we evoke bloch s theorem , which states that @xmath125 thus the only change of the spinor after one unit cell is the multiplication by a phase factor @xmath126 | therefore @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the @xmath39 identity matrix .",
    "now , equations and can be combined in in the following equation @xmath129 which is the band condition for finite @xmath1 .",
    "note that in absence of sois the method summarized by eq .",
    "is equivalent to the tm method  @xcite .",
    "but when sois are considered and a four - dimensional space is needed , it gives all conditions on the eigenvalues of @xmath32 while the tm method gives only conditions on the sum of eigenvalues .",
    "figure  [ fig : contourplot ] shows the number of solutions of the band equation   as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath130 for all the allowed values of @xmath46 in the first brillouin zone . as in the previous cases , these results can be explained by looking at the dispersion relation for uniform soi .",
    "there , a finite value of @xmath130 | equivalent to a finite value of @xmath1 | leads to an energy gap at @xmath131 even if @xmath132 . accordingly , in panel , where the number of allowed bands for the modulated case with @xmath113 and @xmath132 is shown , a band gap growing with @xmath130 is displayed .",
    "another feature , which is the same for the uniform soi case and the present one , is that if either of @xmath23 and @xmath22 are zero , electron - hole symmetry is also preserved for finite @xmath130 .",
    "this can be seen , although only in terms of the number of allowed bands , in panel and in panel , where either of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are zero and the electron - hole symmetry is preserved , while this is not the case in panel and , where both , @xmath23 and @xmath22 , are finite .",
    "we have studied the band structure of graphene under a periodically modulated soi . in this case",
    "spin - full fermions have to be considered , transforming the original su(2 ) structure of the graphene hamiltonian into a su(2)@xmath0su(2 ) superstructure . for this case",
    "the tm method | commonly used for calculating band structures | is not applicable .",
    "nevertheless , we have proposed a generalization of the tm method for the spin - dependent case at @xmath73 .",
    "the new method is possible because of the special form of the matrix of spinors inside the so potential .",
    "this permits us to calculate analytic equations [ c.f .",
    "eq .  ] for the spin - polarized bands , which in turn enables us to estimate the gaps due to avoided band crossings at the brillouin zone boundaries [ c.f .",
    "eq .  ] via a perturbative approach . in addition",
    ", we analyze the dependence of the band structure on the length of the soi potential compared to the spin - precession length [ c.f .",
    "[ fig : spinprec ] ] . here",
    "we consider the spin precession length in the limit of energies much larger than the soi coupling constants , where it is independent of the energy [ c.f .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the band structures for finite @xmath1 within an approach based on the bloch s theorem .",
    "this leads to a band equation [ c.f .",
    "eq .  ] , which we solve numerically",
    ". we find that the modification to the band structure due to finite angles @xmath1 can be understood by considering the properties of the energy dispersion for the case of uniform soi .",
