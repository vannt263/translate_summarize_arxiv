    "<S> we show that jaynes - cummings dynamics can be observed in mesoscopic atomic ensembles interacting with a classical electromagnetic field in the regime of a rydberg blockade where the time dynamics of the average number of rydberg excitations in mesoscopic ensembles displays collapses and revivals typical of this model . as the frequency of rabi oscillations between collective states of rydberg - blockaded ensembles depends on the number of interacting atoms , for randomly loaded optical dipole traps we predict collapses and revivals of rabi oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the effects of finite interaction strengths and a finite laser line width on the visibility of the revivals . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that observation of collapses and revivals of rabi oscillations can be used as a signature of the rydberg blockade without the need to measure the exact number of rydberg atoms . </S>"
