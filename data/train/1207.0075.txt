    "in the conventional superconductors @xcite , an energy gap exists in the electronic energy spectrum only below the superconducing ( sc ) transition temperature @xmath2 , which is corresponding to the energy for breaking a cooper pair of the charge carriers and creating two excited states .",
    "however , in cuprate superconductors above @xmath2 but below a temperature @xmath0 , an energy gap called the normal - state pseudogap exists @xcite .",
    "although the sc gap has a domelike shape of the doping dependence @xcite , the magnitude of the normal - state pseudogap is much larger than that of the sc gap in the underdoped regime @xcite , then it smoothly decreases upon increasing doping , and seems to merge with the sc gap in the overdoped regime , eventually disappearing together with superconductivity at the end of the sc dome @xcite .",
    "since many of the unusual physical properties of cuprate superconductors have often been attributed to particular characteristics of the low - energy excitations determined by the electronic structure @xcite , the normal - state pseudogap observed in the excitation spectrum as a suppression of the spectral weight is thought to be key to understanding the mechanism of superconductivity .    during the last two decades",
    ", the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has been emerged as a powerful tool for studying the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors , since it is a direct method for probing the momentum dependence of the sc gap and the locus in the momentum space where the quasiparticle excitations are gapless @xcite . in spite of the nonconventional sc mechanism ,",
    "the arpes experimental results have unambiguously established the bogoliubov - quasiparticle nature of the sharp sc quasiparticle peak in cuprate superconductors in the overdoped regime @xcite , then the sc coherence of the low energy quasiparticle excitation is well fitted by a simple bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) formalism @xcite with a d - wave sc gap .",
    "however , the pseudogap state is particularly obvious in the underdoped regime @xcite , this leads to that the physical properties of cuprate superconductors in the underdoped regime exhibit a number of the anomalous properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , the arpes experimental data show that in the underdoped regime , although the normal - state of cuprate superconductors is metallic , the part of the fermi surface is gapped out by the normal - state pseudogap , then the low - energy electron excitations occupy disconnected segments called as the fermi arcs located at the nodal region in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "moreover , in corresponding to the doping and temperature dependence of the normal - state pseudogap , the essential feature of the evolution of the fermi arc length with doping and temperature has been established now @xcite : ( 1 ) the fermi arc in the underdoped regime increases in length with temperatures , till at about the normal - state pseudogap crossover temperature @xmath0 , then it covers the full length of the fermi surface ( a continuous contour in momentum space ) for the temperature @xmath1 @xcite ; ( 2 ) the fermi arc increases its length as a function of doping @xcite , and then it evolves into a continuous contour in momentum space near the end of the sc dome . in particular , the experimental data indicate both the particle - hole symmetry breaking and the pronounced spectral broadending due to the presence of the normal - state pseudogap , which reflect the spatial symmetry breaking without long - range order at the opening of the normal - state pseudogap @xcite .",
    "it is thus established that the low - energy quasiparticle excitations at the fermi energy dramatically change with doping and temperature , and have a close relation to the normal - state pseudogap .",
    "although the main features of the particle - hole asymmetry electronic state in cuprate superconductors and the related doping and temperature dependence of the fermi arc length are well - established by now @xcite , their full understanding is still a challenging issue . in our recent work @xcite , the interplay between the sc gap and normal - state pseudogap in cuprate superconductors has been studied based on the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite , where the charge carriers interact directly through the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations , then this microscopic interaction provides a natural explanation of both the origin of the normal - state pseudogap state in the particle - hole channel and the pairing mechanism for superconductivity in the particle - particle channel @xcite . in this paper , we study the low - energy electronic structure of cuprate superconductors along with this line @xcite .",
    "we evaluate explicitly the electron spectral function by taking into account the interplay between the sc gap and normal - state pseudogap , and then qualitatively reproduce the main features of the arpes measurements on cuprate superconductors @xcite , including the doping and temperature dependence of the fermi arc length .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the basic formalism in section [ framework ] , while the quantitative characteristics of the particle - hole asymmetry electronic state are discussed in section [ electronic - structure ] , where we show that the particle - hole asymmetry electronic state and the related doping and temperature dependence of the fermi arc length are intriguingly related to the emergence of the normal - state pseudogap in the particle - hole channel .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in cuprate superconductors , the single common feature is the presence of the cuo@xmath3 plane @xcite , and it seems evident that the unusual behavior is dominated by this plane .",
    "very soon after the discovery of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors , it has been argued that the essential physics of the doped cuo@xmath3 plane is contained in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model on a square lattice @xcite , @xmath6 supplemented by an important on - site local constraint @xmath7 to remove the double occupancy , where the summation is over all sites @xmath8 , and for each @xmath8 , over its nearest - neighbors @xmath9 or the next nearest - neighbors @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are electron operators that respectively create and annihilate electrons with spin @xmath13 , @xmath14 are spin operators , and @xmath15 is the chemical potential . for a proper treatment of the electron single occupancy local constraint in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model ( [ t - j - model ] ) , a charge - spin separation ( css ) fermion - spin theory @xcite",
    "has been proposed , where a spin - up annihilation ( spin - down annihilation ) operator for the physical electron is given by a composite operator as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , with the spinful fermion operator @xmath18 that keeps track of the charge degree of freedom of the electron together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself ( charge carrier ) , while the spin operator @xmath19 describes the spin degree of freedom of the electron , then the electron single occupancy local constraint is satisfied in analytical calculations . in this css fermion - spin representation ,",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 model ( [ t - j - model ] ) can be rewritten as @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and the doping concentration @xmath22 .    as in the conventional superconductors",
    "@xcite , the sc - state in cuprate superconductors is also characterized by the cooper pairs , forming sc quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "however , as a natural consequence of the unconventional sc mechanism that is responsible for the high sc transition temperatures @xcite , the cooper pair in cuprate superconductors has a dominant d - wave symmetry @xcite . in this case ,",
    "one of the main concerns in the field of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors is about the origin of the d - wave cooper pairs . from the experimental side",
    ", it has been well established that the antiferromagnetic short - range correlation coexists with the sc - state in the whole sc regime @xcite , which provides a clear link between the pairing mechanism and magnetic excitation . on the theoretical hand ,",
    "we have developed a kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite based on the @xmath4-@xmath5 model ( [ css - t - jmodel ] ) , where the charge carrier interaction directly from the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations induces a d - wave charge carrier pairing state in the particle - particle channel , then the electron cooper pairs originating from the charge carrier pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination , and their condensation reveals the sc ground - state .",
    "moreover , this sc - state is controlled by both the sc gap and quasiparticle coherence , which leads to that the maximal sc transition temperature occurs around the optimal doping , and then decreases in both the underdoped and overdoped regimes .",
    "this microscopic sc theory gives a consistent description of the physical properties of cuprate superconductors , including the doping and temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity @xcite , the extinction of the quasiparticle scattering interference @xcite , and the doping dependence of the meissner effect @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown recently that besides the pairing mechanism in the particle - particle channel provided by the charge carrier interaction directly from the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations , this same microscopic interaction also induces the normal - state pseudogap state in the particle - hole channel @xcite .",
    "based on this work @xcite , we @xcite have discussed the doping dependence of the specific - heat of cuprate superconductors , and shown that the striking behavior of the specific - heat humplike anomaly near @xmath2 in the underdoped regime can be attributed to the emergence of the normal - state pseudogap .",
    "following our previous discussions @xcite , the full charge carrier diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions of the @xmath4-@xmath5 model ( [ css - t - jmodel ] ) in the sc - state can be obtained as ,    [ hole - greens - function ] @xmath23},\\label{hole - diagonal - green's - function}\\\\ \\gamma^{\\dagger}({\\bf k},\\omega)&=&-{\\bar{\\delta}_{\\rm h}({\\bf k})\\over [ \\omega-\\xi_{\\bf k } -\\sigma^{({\\rm h})}_{1}({\\bf k},\\omega)][\\omega+\\xi_{\\bf k}+\\sigma^{({\\rm h})}_{1}({\\bf k},-\\omega ) ] -\\bar{\\delta}^{2}_{\\rm h}({\\bf k})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively , where @xmath24 is the mean - field charge carrier spectrum with the spin correlation functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the number of the nearest - neighbor or next nearest - neighbor sites on a square lattice .",
    "the effective charge carrier pair gap @xmath30 , therefore it is closely related to the charge carrier self - energy @xmath31 in the _ particle - particle channel _ @xcite , and can be expressed explicitly as a d - wave form @xmath32 with @xmath33 , while the effective charge carrier pair gap parameter @xmath34 and the charge carrier self - energy @xmath35 in the _ particle - hole channel _ have been given in ref . .",
    "in this case , the fermi energy is determined by the pole of the green s function ( [ hole - greens - function ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 can be written as @xcite @xmath37^{2}/[\\omega+m_{\\bf k}]$ ] with the effective normal - state pseudogap @xmath38 and the energy spectrum @xmath39 , which reflects that the effective normal - state pseudogap @xmath38 originates from @xmath36 @xcite . in this case , the imaginary part of @xmath36 can be obtained as @xmath40^{2}\\delta(\\omega+m_{\\bf k})$ ] .",
    "this imaginary part is defined as a momentum dependence of the characteristic scattering rate ( then the characteristic lifetime ) , and the type of this imaginary part is an intrinsic property of the electronic state of cuprate superconductors , since it has been used to provide a robust fit for the electron spectrum and spatially inhomogeneous differential conductances @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the d - wave charge carrier pairing state in the particle - particle channel originating from the kinetic energy by exchanging the spin excitations also leads to form a d - wave electron cooper pairing state @xcite . for discussions of the electronic structure in the sc - state , we need to calculate the electron diagonal green s function @xmath41 , which is a convolution of the spin green s function @xmath42 and charge carrier diagonal green s function ( [ hole - diagonal - greens - function ] ) in the css fermion - spin theory @xcite , and can be evaluated in terms of the spectral representation as ,      where the charge carrier spectral function @xmath44 , while the spin excitation spectrum @xmath45 and the function @xmath46 have been given in ref . .",
    "this convolution of the spin green s function and charge carrier green s function reflects the charge - spin recombination @xcite .",
    "the electronic state in a solid is characterized by its energy dispersion as well as the characteristic lifetime ( then the characteristic scattering rate ) of an electron placed into such a state .",
    "this state is just represented by the electron green s function ( [ electron - greens - function ] ) , while the electron spectral function @xmath47 is directly related to the analytically continued electron green s function ( [ electron - greens - function ] ) as @xmath48 , and can be obtained explicitly in terms of the electron green s function ( [ electron - greens - function ] ) as , @xmath49+a_{\\rm h}({\\bf p},-\\omega_{{\\bf",

    "in this section , we discuss the particle - hole asymmetry electronic state in cuprate superconductors and the related doping and temperature dependence of the fermi arc length in the presence of the normal - state pseudogap . in our recent work @xcite , we have shown that there is a coexistence of the sc gap and normal - state pseudogap in the whole sc dome , where the effective charge carrier pair gap parameter @xmath34 has a domelike shape of the doping dependence , while the magnitude of the effective normal - state pseudogap parameter @xmath50 is particularly large in the underdoped regime , then it smoothly decreases with increasing doping , and eventually disappears together with superconductivity at the end of the sc dome . in particular , this @xmath50",
    "is closely related to the charge carrier quasiparticle coherent weight @xmath51 as @xcite @xmath52^{2}/m^{2}_{\\bf k}|_{{\\bf k}=[\\pi,0]}$ ] , this is why @xmath51 grows linearly with doping @xcite .",
    "we have therefore established a relationship between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the obtained evolution of both @xmath50 and @xmath51 with doping is qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental data @xcite .",
    "since the sc - state in the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism is controlled by both the sc gap and quasiparticle coherence @xcite , and in this sense , the normal - state pseudogap is a necessary ingredient for superconductivity .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 is also temperature dependent , and it vanishes at the normal - state pseudogap crossover temperature @xmath0 , while this @xmath0 as a function of doping has a similar doping dependence as @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by calculation of the ratio of the effective charge carrier pair gap parameter @xmath34 and the charge carrier pair gap parameter @xmath53 , we @xcite have also obtained the coupling ( interaction ) strength @xmath54 , and the result shows clearly that @xmath54 smoothly decreases upon increasing doping from a strong - coupling case in the underdoped regime to a weak - coupling side in the overdoped regime .",

    ", the particle - hole symmetry is broken due to the presence the normal - state pseudogap . however , with increasing temperatures , in particular , for @xmath1 , both the normal - state pseudogap @xmath105 and the charge carrier pair gap @xmath99 , and in this case , the full charge carrier diagonal green s function ( [ hole - greens - function ] ) is reduced as , @xmath106 in this case , the normal - state is a particle - hole symmetry landau fermi liquid similar to that of an ordinary metal , and the fermi arc turns into a continuous contour in momentum space .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the particle - hole asymmetry electronic state in cuprate superconductors and the related doping and temperature dependence of the fermi arc length within the framework of the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism . by taking into account the interplay between the sc gap and normal - state pseudogap , we have reproduced qualitatively the essential feature of the evolution of the fermi arc length with doping and temperature .",
    "our results show that the particle - hole asymmetry electronic state in cuprate superconductors is a natural consequence due to the presence the normal - state pseudogap in the particle - hole channel . the fermi arc length increases with increasing temperature below @xmath0 , and",
    "it covers the full length of the fermi surface for @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , in analogy to the temperature dependence of the fermi arc length , the low - temperature fermi arc length in the underdoped regime increases with increasing doping , and then it evolves into a continuous contour in momentum space near the end of the sc dome .",
    "the theory also predicts an almost linear doping dependence of the fermi arc length , which should be verified by further experiments .",
    "since the knowledge of the particle - hole asymmetry electronic state is of considerable importance as a test for the microscopic sc mechanism in cuprate superconductors , the qualitative agreement between the present theoretical results and arpes experimental data also provides an important confirmation of the nature of the sc phase of cuprate superconductors as a coexistence of the kinetic energy driven d - wave sc - state in the particle - particle channel and the normal - state pseudogap state in the particle - hole channel in the whole sc dome .",
