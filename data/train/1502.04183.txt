    "it is possible to extend the pseudo - riemannian ( i.e. , lorentzian ) structure of general relativity ( gr ) in a natural way by adding a second nonsymmetric connection due to weitzenbck  @xcite .",

    ", one must extend gr by introducing a second ( weitzenbck ) connection , which is so defined as to render a smooth orthonormal frame field parallel in extended gr .",
    "therefore , of all possible smooth frame fields on riemannian spacetime , one system can be chosen in order to define a global system of parallel axes that are , however , specified up to global lorentz transformations .",
    "this circumstance is reminiscent of the parallel frame fields of _ inertial _ observers in minkowski spacetime . in extended gr",
    ", the chosen parallel frame field is adapted to a _",

    ", we get metric compatibility ; that is , @xmath6 .",
    "this leads to a global notion of parallelism ; namely , distant vectors may be considered parallel if they have the same local components relative to their preferred frames .",

    "greek indices run from 0 to 3 , while latin indices run from 1 to 3 .",
    "the signature of the metric is + 2 .",
    "we use a left superscript  0 \" for geometric quantities related to the levi - civita connection .",
    "our conventions regarding the use of a nonsymmetric connection are explained in appendix a.    let us consider the frame components of the weitzenbck torsion with respect to the preferred orthonormal frame @xmath10 with dual @xmath11 such that @xmath12 ; that is , [ eq:6 ] c_^=e^_e^ _ ( _ e_^- _ e_^ ) .",
    "these are measurable in principle and are essentially the structure functions of the preferred frame @xmath13 ; that is , [ eq:7 ] [ e _ , e _ ] = - c_^e_. equivalently , these components can be obtained by evaluating the exterior derivative of the frame @xmath14-forms @xmath15 according to the relation [ eq:8 ] d ^=12 c_^ ^^ , or the lie derivative of the frame vectors along each other [ eq:9 ]  _ e _ e_=[e _ , e_]=-c _ ^e _ and its  dual \" relation [ eq:10 ]  _ e _ ^=c _ ^ ^.    at any event in spacetime , two orthonormal frames are related to each other by an element of the local lorentz group ; therefore , @xmath16 transforms as a third - rank tensor under local lorentz transformations .",

    "the main purpose of this paper is to calculate the structure functions @xmath16 in a general and physically transparent setting and study their physical properties .",

    "finally , section v contains a discussion of our results .",
    "to gain physical insight into the structure of weitzenbck s torsion , we consider an arbitrary gravitational field in extended gr and establish a fermi coordinate system in a cylindrical spacetime region along the world line of an arbitrary accelerated observer @xmath20 .",
    "fermi coordinates are invariantly defined and constitute the natural general - relativistic generalization of inertial cartesian coordinates .",
    "we then define the frame field of _ static _ observers in the fermi coordinate system and calculate explicitly their measured torsion tensor @xmath21 .",

    "let us next establish an extended fermi normal coordinate system in a world tube along @xmath22 .",

    "thus the reference observer @xmath42 is always at the spatial origin of the fermi coordinate system .",
    "the coordinate transformation @xmath43 can only be specified implicitly in general ; hence , it is useful to express the spacetime metric in fermi coordinates as a taylor expansion in powers of the spatial distance @xmath37 away from the reference world line . for our present purposes ,",
    "we can write the metric in fermi coordinates as @xmath44 here , we have introduced [ f4 ] p= 1 + u , u = a , = and we have used the notation [ f5 ] = 12 r_0 i 0 jx^i x^j,_i = 13 r_0 j i kx^jx^k , _",
