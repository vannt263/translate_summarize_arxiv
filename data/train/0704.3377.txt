    "the ease with which modern imaging surveys can map large areas of sky to faint magnitude limits compensates for the absence of precise ( but time - consuming ) spectroscopic redshift measurements for individual galaxies .",
    "an absolute pre - requisite , however , is the availability of high - quality photometric galaxy redshifts with known error distributions ( established for example via spectroscopy of sub - samples ) , together with accurate survey photometric calibration over large angles of sky .",
    "recent observational efforts have enabled both of these criteria to be satisfied .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) has now provided an accurately - calibrated imaging dataset over roughly a fifth of the sky , which can be used to extract samples of galaxies in a uniform manner . in particular , a photometric catalogue of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) can be readily extracted using a series of well - understood colour and magnitude cuts ( eisenstein et al .",
    "owing to their high luminosity and typical residence in the most massive dark matter haloes , lrgs are efficient tracers of cosmic structure across large volumes ( brown et al .",
    "2003 ; zehavi et al .  2005a",
    "; eisenstein et al .",
    "moreover , these objects provide particularly reliable photometric redshifts owing to the strong spectral break at @xmath13 in the galaxy rest frame and the consequent rapid variation with redshift of their observed colours in the sdss filter system ( padmanabhan et al .",
    "2005 ; collister et al .",
    "furthermore , the photometric redshift error distribution of the lrgs can be accurately calibrated owing to the existence of spectroscopic observations of a sub - sample as part of the 2df - sdss lrg and quasar ( 2slaq ) survey at the anglo - australian telescope ( cannon et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the combination of these datasets has allowed us to construct a large catalogue of more than @xmath14 lrgs spanning the redshift range @xmath15 with an r.m.s .",
    "photometric redshift error @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we have dubbed this catalogue `` megaz - lrg '' ( collister et al .",
    "the database covers almost @xmath18 deg@xmath3 , or an effective volume @xmath19 @xmath5 gpc@xmath6 .",
    "we have already used this catalogue to measure the large - scale clustering of the galaxies on linear and quasi - linear scales via a power spectrum analysis and thereby extract measurements of cosmological parameters ( blake et al .  2007 ;",
    "see also padmanabhan et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this study",
    "we turn to the small - scale clustering properties of the lrgs .",
    "our goal is to present new measurements of the small - scale correlation function of lrgs at @xmath20 , and to connect these measurements to the physical manner in which these lrgs populate dark matter haloes .",
    "it has long been known that different classes of galaxy possess different clustering properties , in a manner connected to their small - scale environments ( for recent observational studies we refer the reader to norberg et al .",
    "2002 ; budavari et al .  2003 ; hogg et al .  2003 ; zehavi et al .  2005b ; and references therein ) . for many years these differing clustering properties could be adequately described by fitting a simple power - law function to the two - point galaxy correlation function on small scales ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "however , recent surveys have measured the clustering pattern accurately enough to detect deviations from the canonical clustering power - law ( e.g.  hawkins et al .  2003 ; zehavi et al .  2004",
    "; zheng 2004 ; eisenstein et al .  2005a ; zehavi et al .",
    "2005a , b ; phleps et al .  2006 ) .",
    "these deviations provide an important insight into the processes of galaxy formation .",
    "the richer structure in the galaxy clustering pattern revealed by recent surveys has been successfully interpreted in terms of the `` halo model '' ( e.g.  seljak 2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; scoccimarro et al .",
    "2001 ; cooray & sheth 2002 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; kravtsov et al .",

    "2005b ; collister & lahav 2005 ; tinker et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this model , the small - scale clustering of a distribution of galaxies",
    "is linked to the underlying network of dark matter haloes , whose properties can be measured using cosmological simulations . a class of galaxies is assumed to populate haloes in accordance with a statistical `` halo occupation distribution '' as a function of the halo mass .",
    "the clustering then naturally separates into two components : the distribution of galaxies within individual haloes , which dominates on small scales ( @xmath21 mpc ) , and the mutual clustering of galaxies inhabiting separate haloes , which dominates on larger scales ( @xmath22 mpc ) .",
    "the combination of these two terms can accurately model the observed scale - dependent features in the small - scale clustering pattern .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ secdata ] we briefly describe the `` megaz - lrg '' dataset .",
    "we then present measurements of the angular correlation function in narrow redshift slices together with simple power - law fits in section [ secmeas ] . in section [ sechalo ]",
    "we introduce the framework of the halo model and in section [ secparfit ] we re - fit the clustering measurements by parameterizing the halo occupation distribution of the lrgs , comparing our results to previous work in section [ secprev ] .",
    "section [ secsys ] investigates a range of potential systematic photometric errors in the catalogue that may bias our results .",
    "we conclude in section [ secconc ] .    throughout our study",
    "we assume a fixed set of large - scale cosmological parameters : fractional matter density @xmath23 , cosmological constant @xmath24 , curvature @xmath25 , hubble parameter @xmath26 , fractional baryon density @xmath27 , slope of the primordial power spectrum @xmath28 , and overall normalization of the power spectrum @xmath10 .",
    "these values are consistent with fits to the large - scale power spectrum of the lrgs ( blake et al .",
    "2007 ) and to the latest measurements of the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( spergel et al .  2007 ) .",
    "we note that there is some degeneracy between the assumed cosmological parameters and the fitted halo model parameters , and we investigate how the best - fitting halo model parameters depend on the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we analyze angular clustering in the `` megaz - lrg '' galaxy database , a photometric - redshift catalogue of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) based on the imaging dataset of the sdss 4th data release .",
    "the construction of this catalogue is described in detail by collister et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and cosmological - parameter fitting to the angular power spectrum is presented by blake et al .",
    "we only provide a brief description of the catalogue here , refering the reader to these two papers for more information .",
    "megaz - lrg contains over @xmath14 lrgs spanning the redshift range @xmath15 with an r.m.s .",
    "redshift error @xmath31 .",
    "the angular selection function is described by blake et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and encompasses 5914 deg@xmath3 ( the three southern sdss stripes are excluded ) .",
    "the sample was selected from the sdss imaging database using a series of colour and magnitude cuts ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ; collister et al .",
    "2007 ) , which amount to a magnitude - limited sample of luminous red galaxies with @xmath32-band magnitudes @xmath33 .",
    "photometric redshifts were derived for these galaxies using an artificial neural network method , annz ( firth , lahav & somerville 2003 ; collister & lahav 2004 ) , constrained by a spectroscopic sub - sample of @xmath34 galaxies obtained by the 2slaq survey ( cannon et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this paper",
    "we analyze a `` conservative '' version of the database in which the selection cuts applied to the imaging database are identical to those used to produce the great majority of the spectroscopic sub - sample ( e.g.  the faint magnitude limit is brightened to @xmath35 ) .",
    "star - galaxy separation cuts were applied both in the initial selection from the sdss database and via the neural network analysis .",
    "these cuts produced a catalogue with @xmath36 entries , amongst which there is a @xmath37 m - star contamination ( see blake et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we used the photometric redshifts to divide the sample into four narrow redshift slices of width @xmath38 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( there are very few galaxies in the catalogue outside this redshift range ) .",
    "we then applied a luminosity threshold in each redshift range to create a `` volume - limited '' sample of galaxies , as assumed by the halo model .",
    "the luminosity threshold is given by the faint apparent magnitude limit @xmath41 applied at the most distant redshift of each slice .",
    "we calculated luminosities for each galaxy using luminous red galaxy k - corrections from the 2slaq survey ( wake et al .",
    "2006 ) , not including an evolution correction .",
    "the faint absolute @xmath32-band magnitude limits for each redshift slice are then @xmath42 . the number of galaxies remaining in each redshift slice after the luminosity cut was @xmath43 with corresponding surface densities @xmath44 deg@xmath45 .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift distribution of galaxies in each photo-@xmath46 slice ( including the luminosity cut ) can be deduced using the 2slaq spectroscopic sub - sample . as shown by blake et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the spec-@xmath46 probability distribution for each slice is well - described by a gaussian function ; the mean @xmath47 and standard deviation @xmath48 for each photo-@xmath46 slice are listed in table [ tabpowfit ] ( note that these values are slightly different from those listed in blake et al .  2007 , due to the additional luminosity threshold applied in the current study ) .",
    "these redshift distributions are used to project the model correlation function to fit the observed angular clustering in each slice .",
    "we used the landy & szalay ( 1993 ) estimator to measure @xmath49 for each photometric redshift slice in 30 logarithmically - spaced angular separation bins between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for each redshift slice we generated 10 random datasets across the survey geometry ,",
    "each containing the same number of galaxies as the survey datasets .",
    "we assume that the @xmath37 stellar contamination is distributed evenly across the redshift slices in an unclustered fashion such that the amplitude of the measured angular correlation function is simply reduced by a constant factor @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "we corrected our estimates of @xmath49 and corresponding errors upwards by this factor ( of @xmath54 ) .",
    "we estimated the covariance matrix of the errors in the separation bins using the technique of jack - knife resampling .",
    "for each measurement of @xmath49 we divided the survey area into @xmath55 sub - fields of constant area ( of @xmath56 deg@xmath3 ) using a grid of right ascension and declination divisions ( see figure [ figjack ] ) .",
    "when creating the grid , we allowed a sub - field to contain up to @xmath57 fractional area beyond survey edges or of survey holes .",
    "the number of sub - fields was chosen to be sufficient for estimating each unique element of the covariance matrix used in the model fitting with statistical independence .",
    "however , we checked that our best - fitting parameters did not depend on the number of sub - fields , or on the restriction of our fits to the most significant principal components of the covariance matrix using singular value decomposition techniques .",
    "having defined the grid of @xmath58 sub - fields , we then measured @xmath49 @xmath58 times , which we label as @xmath59 from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , in each case omitting just one of the sub - fields ( and using the remaining @xmath62 fields ) .",
    "the covariance of the measurements between separation bins @xmath63 and @xmath64 was deduced as :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 .",
    "figure [ figerr ] plots the jack - knife errors in the separation bins for each redshift slice , normalized by the error determined assuming simple poisson statistics ( for which the error in the data pair count of @xmath67 objects in a separation bin is @xmath68 ) . for most of the angular range under investigation , the jack - knife errors are less than @xmath69 higher than those predicted by poisson statistics . for the largest angular scales",
    "@xmath70 considered , the jack - knife error increases relative to the poisson error , owing to the increasing importance of edge effects and the heightened `` cosmic variance '' owing to the reduced number of independent cells of size @xmath70 that can be accommodated by the dataset .",
    "this is the familiar result from clustering measurements that poisson noise dominates on small scales , and cosmic variance dominates on large scales .",
    "the full covariance matrices are displayed in figure [ figcov ] by plotting in grey - scale the `` correlation coefficient '' between two separation bins @xmath32 and @xmath63 : @xmath71 angular correlation function measurements in large separation bins are positively correlated . the amplitude of these correlations decreases with redshift because , as the number density of the sample reduces , poisson noise becomes more important compared to cosmic variance .",
    "these covariance matrices are always used in our model fitting .      as an initial step we fitted power - laws @xmath72 to the measured angular correlation functions in the four redshift slices ( using chi - squared minimization with the full covariance matrix ) .",
    "we excluded the first 3 data points with separations @xmath73",
    "( @xmath74 arcsec ) , as these scales are potentially affected by astronomical seeing and issues of galaxy merging and blending ( the decrease in the value of the correlation functions at the smallest scales in figure [ figcorrpowfit ] is not a property of galaxy clustering ) .",
    "the best - fitting power - law parameters @xmath75 are listed in table [ tabpowfit ] and the models and data points are displayed in figure [ figcorrpowfit ] .",
    "the best - fitting slopes @xmath76 for the redshift slices take values in the range @xmath77 , consistent with previous studies of luminous red galaxies ( e.g.  eisenstein et al .",
    "2005a ; zehavi et al .",
    "however , as indicated by the high values of the minimum chi - squared statistic @xmath78 in table [ tabpowfit ] compared to the 25 degrees of freedom , a power - law is not a good fit to the data .",
    "the fact that we detect deviations from simple power - law clustering with high significance indicates that our photo-@xmath46 survey can be used to fit more complex and physically - insightful models to the small - scale clustering pattern .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabhalofit ]    in table [ tabhalofit ] we also list the derived values of the galaxy bias factor @xmath79 and effective halo mass @xmath80 for each redshift slice ( calculated using equations [ eqbg ] and [ eqmeff ] ) .",
    "the errors in these quantities were obtained by evaluating their values over the fine grid of halo model parameters and weighting by the appropriate probability for the fit of model to data at each grid point .",
    "the range of linear bias , increasing with redshift from @xmath81 ( at @xmath82 ) to @xmath83 ( at @xmath84 ) , agrees well with fits to the large - scale power spectrum of the lrgs ( blake et al .",
    "2007 ) , allowing for the differing values of the normalization @xmath29 ( in this study we have assumed @xmath10 , whereas the bias values in blake et al .",
    "( 2007 ) are quoted for @xmath85 ) .",
    "the effective mass , ranging from @xmath86 over the same redshift range , confirms that lrgs are hosted by massive dark matter haloes and are highly biased tracers of the clustering pattern .",
    "our values for the effective mass are in the same range as the lrg halo mass measured by mandelbaum et al .",
    "( 2006b ) using galaxy - galaxy lensing ( @xmath87 for the bright sample of mandelbaum et al . ) .",
    "we note that the systematic increase in galaxy bias in each redshift slice is driven more by the increasing luminosity threshold rather than redshift evolution .",
    "figure [ fighod ] plots the statistical range of allowed halo occupation distributions @xmath88 in each of the four redshift slices assuming the parametric description of equations [ eqhod1 ] and [ eqhod2 ] . the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 were varied over a grid and the probability determined at each grid point using the @xmath92 statistic .",
    "this probability distribution was used to construct the mean and standard deviation of the value of @xmath88 as a function of halo mass @xmath93 .",
    "the average number of our galaxy sample hosted by a halo of mass @xmath94 is @xmath95 in the four redshift slices , decreasing systematically with redshift as the threshold luminosity increases . broadly speaking",
    ", the effect of increasing luminosity is to shift the hod to higher masses without significantly changing its shape , i.e.  shifting to the right in figure [ fighod ] in a similar fashion for central and satellite galaxies . if we weight the hod by the mass function of haloes which steeply decreases with increasing mass , we find that the fraction of galaxies that are classified as central galaxies is very high : @xmath96 in the four redshift slices .",
    "this agrees with the standard picture of luminous red galaxies forming at the heart of massive dark matter haloes .",
    "the best - fitting value of @xmath91 , the slope of the power - law hod for satellite galaxies , increases systematically with redshift .",
    "the most important cause of this trend is evolution of @xmath91 with luminosity , as measured at low redshift ( zehavi et al .",
    "investigating this further , we re - fitted the halo model parameters in each of the redshift slices for each of the absolute @xmath32-band magnitude thresholds @xmath97 which correspond to the luminosity thresholds of the four redshift slices . hence all redshift slices can provide a sample with @xmath98 , but only the first redshift slice contributes a sample with @xmath99 .",
    "we obtained the probability distribution for @xmath91 for each halo model fit , marginalizing over the other model parameters , and combined the results for matched luminosity samples in different redshift slices .",
    "we find that the measurements of @xmath91 at a fixed luminosity threshold agree well between the redshift slices , and the combined result for the four luminosity thresholds listed above is @xmath100 , confirming a significant evolution of @xmath91 with luminosity .",
    "considering just the first redshift slice , the best - fitting effective halo mass for the four luminosity slices is @xmath101 corresponding to number densities @xmath102 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "our results have a significant dependence on the assumed value of @xmath10 , which sets the overall normalization of the matter power spectrum . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the best - fitting effective halo mass in each of the four redshift slices is @xmath104 . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the results were @xmath106 .",
    "in all cases the minimum values of @xmath92 were similar to those obtained for our default value of @xmath29 , suggesting that there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath29 and the halo model parameters used in this analysis .",
    "the changing @xmath29 affected the best - fitting value of @xmath90 much more strongly than the value of @xmath91 .",
    "we also tried lowering the value of the scalar spectral index of the primordial power spectrum from @xmath28 to @xmath107 , as supported by recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( spergel et al .",
    "assuming @xmath10 , the best - fitting effective masses are @xmath108 which do not differ significantly from our default values presented in table [ tabhalofit ] .",
    "several previous studies have fitted halo model parameters to populations of red galaxies , for example : magliocchetti & porciani ( 2003 , 2dfgrs ) ; zehavi et al .",

    "we make comparisons to these analyses below , where possible .",
    "halo model fits to the 2dfgrs galaxy correlation function for late - type and early - type galaxies were performed by magliocchetti & porciani ( 2003 ) . in addition , collister & lahav ( 2005 ) directly investigated the distribution of galaxies within 2dfgrs groups .",
    "these two studies produced a reasonably consistent measurement of the slope @xmath109 of the hod at high masses for early - type galaxies .",
    "our best - fitting slope , @xmath110 , is much higher due to two factors : ( 1 ) the significantly higher luminosity of our galaxy samples ; ( 2 ) we make the distinction between central and satellite galaxies , separating out a central galaxy contribution @xmath111 at high masses .",
    "this latter has the effect of significantly steepening the slope of the power - law hod fitted to the remaining satellite galaxies ( which in fact contribute only @xmath112 of our sample , as noted in section [ secparfit ] ) . in other words ,",
    "we effectively fit a model @xmath113 at high masses , rather than @xmath114 .",

    "they find that the slope of the power - law satellite hod increases systematically with luminosity in a manner entirely consistent with our high - luminosity measurements of @xmath110 .",
    "in addition , zehavi et al .",
    "( 2005b ) note that the step function for @xmath124 produces a poor fit to the data in their highest - luminosity bin , consistent with our requirement for a softened transition parameterized by @xmath89 .",
    "they also find , in agreement with our analysis , that the great majority of luminous galaxies are central galaxies of their host dark matter haloes , rather than satellites in more massive systems . a low ( @xmath125 ) satellite fraction for the most luminous elliptical galaxies is also found in galaxy - galaxy lensing studies ( seljak et al .  2005 ; mandelbaum et al .",

    "we conclude from figures [ figsys1 ] and [ figsys2 ] that our results are robust against the details of the angular selection function : varying dust extinction , seeing , overlap regions and bright object masks all have little effect on the measured correlation function .",
    "figure [ figsys3 ] reveals that the details of the star - galaxy separation affect the amplitude of the measured correlation function although not ( to first order ) the shape .",

    "the functional form @xmath154 \\}$ ] provides a good fit for central galaxies , combined with a power - law hod for satellite galaxies @xmath155 .",
    "one parameter of the model ( @xmath156 ) is fixed by the overall number density of the galaxy sample ; hence this halo model contains 3 variable parameters ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) , just one more than a simple power law .",
    "allowing the concentration parameter @xmath157 to vary , or including a more sophisticated hod for satellite galaxies , does not improve the model fits . *",
    "the slope @xmath91 of the power - law hod for satellite galaxies is a strong function of luminosity , increasing to @xmath158 for our most luminous sample .",
    "this is consistent with extrapolating the variation of @xmath91 with luminosity in local samples ( zehavi et al .",
    "the physical implication of this result is that haloes of higher mass have greater relative efficiency at producing high - luminosity satellites .",
    "we find no variation of @xmath91 with redshift across our sample ( from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ) . *",
    "the best - fitting width @xmath89 of the transition from zero to one central galaxy with increasing mass is in the range @xmath159 ( this is the parameter least - well constrained by our analysis ) . the physical implication of this result is a scatter between central galaxy luminosity and host halo mass .",
    "this scatter results from galaxy formation physics and from the photo-@xmath46 error in the conversion of apparent magnitude to luminosity . *",
    "the halo model fits describe how luminous red galaxies populate dark matter haloes as a function of their mass @xmath93 .",
    "the average number of our galaxy sample hosted by a halo of mass @xmath160 is @xmath95 in the four redshift slices , decreasing systematically with redshift as the threshold luminosity increases . broadly speaking",
    ", the effect of increasing luminosity is to shift the hod uniformly to higher masses without significantly changing its shape .",
    "the large majority of galaxies in our sample are classified as central galaxies of their host dark matter haloes , rather than satellites in more massive systems , in agreement with previous studies of galaxy - galaxy lensing and clustering of the most luminous galaxies .",
    "the satellite fraction varies in the range @xmath161 across the redshift slices .",
    "* the halo model fits provide robust predictions of the average linear bias of the lrgs on large scales and the effective mass of their host dark matter haloes .",
    "the resulting amplitude of the linear bias ( @xmath162 , increasing with redshift , assuming a normalization of the matter power spectrum @xmath163 ) agrees well with fits to the large - scale power spectrum ( blake et al .",
    "the effective halo mass ( @xmath164 ) provides a quantitative statement of how the lrgs trace the underlying dark matter haloes .",
    "the value of @xmath80 has a significant dependence on @xmath29 , and a weak dependence on the slope of the primordial scalar index @xmath30 : the effective mass increases by @xmath165 when the value of @xmath29 is increased from @xmath166 to @xmath167 , and decreases by @xmath168 when @xmath30 is decreased from @xmath169 to @xmath170 .",
    "future studies will explore joint fits of the cosmological parameters and halo model parameters ( abazajian et al .",
