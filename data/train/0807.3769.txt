    "population iii stars are defined to be those whose formation and evolution are independent of metallicity ( mckee & tan 2008 ; oshea et al . 2008 ) , since their metallicity is extremely low : close to or equal to that arising from big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "population iii.1 stars are defined as having their formation be independent of other stars or other astrophysical objects , so that their initial conditions are determined solely by cosmology .",
    "these stars will be the first objects to form in a given region of the universe and they are likely to play an important role in cosmic reionization and in laying the foundations for the formation and build - up of galaxies .",

    "supersymmetric theories with r - parity naturally provide a stable dark matter candidate which could compose all or part of the dark matter in the universe .",
    "it has been pointed out that , if dark matter consists of a wimp such as the supersymmetric neutralino , the energy released by the annihilation of these particles could influence early structure formation , star formation and protostellar evolution ( ripamonti , mapelli & ferrara 2007 ; ascasibar 2007 ; spolyar , freese , & gondolo 2008 ; iocco 2008 ; freese , spolyar & aguirre 2008 ; freese et al .",

    "we analyzed the structure of the three highest resolution star - forming minihalos in the numerical simulations presented by oshea & norman ( 2007 ) .",
    "we will refer to these simulation runs as a , b , c. these simulations were performed using the enzo code , which is an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) cosmology code developed by g. bryan and others ( e.g. oshea et al .",
    "the code couples an n - body particle mesh ( pm ) solver ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1985 ; hockney & eastwood 1998 ) with eulerian amr .",
    "all simulations were initialized at @xmath57 assuming a concordance cosmological model with @xmath58 and an eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) power spectrum with a spectral index @xmath59 .",
    "each of the three star - forming minihalos was formed in a separate simulation with a different random seeding of the initial conditions and a box size of @xmath60 mpc ( comoving ) . the most massive halo to form in each simulation , at @xmath61 ( typically with a mass @xmath62 )",
    "was found using a dark matter only computation .",
    "the initial conditions were then regenerated with both dark matter and baryons such that the lagrangian volume in which the halo formed was resolved at much higher spatial and mass resolution .",
    "the minimum dark matter particle mass in the simulations was @xmath63 . to avoid effects due to the finite size of the dark matter particles ,",
    "the dark matter density was smoothed on a comoving scale of 0.5 pc , i.e. a proper scale of @xmath64 pc at @xmath65 .",
    "note that the gravitational forces due to the baryonic core of the minihalo are not smoothed , since there is high spatial resolution in this region . at their final timestep , all simulations had more than 100 dark matter particles inside a proper scale of 1  pc .",
    "the dark matter density profile is not resolved in the very central regions of the halo where wimp annihilation heating may be important .",
    "thus the results of these simulations are used as a guide for two extrapolation methods ( dm fits # 1 and # 2 ) to estimate the dark matter density on scales of @xmath66 .",
    "we fit power laws of the form @xmath67 to the radial dark matter density profiles , evaluated over particular ranges in radius .",
    "dm fit # 1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ dm ] , uses only data points from the central regions with more than 100 particles per bin ( corresponding to scales from about 50  pc down to @xmath68  pc ) .",
    "we find @xmath69 and @xmath70 for simulations a , b , c , respectively .",
    "note that simulation c is has a significantly steeper density profile than a and b. all these density profiles are expected to underestimate the dark matter density in the inner regions of the halo , where the baryon density begins to dominate over dark matter and adiabatic contraction of the dark matter tends to steepen its profile ( blumenthal et al .",
    "thus we consider dm fit # 1 to provide a conservative lower limit to the dark mater density and thus the heating rate .",
    "our second extrapolation method , dm fit # 2 , is based on simulation data from the inner ( but not the innermost , @xmath71  pc ) regions ( see fig .  [ dm ] ) . for simulation a , we have @xmath72 , @xmath73 when @xmath74  pc ( and @xmath75 , @xmath76 when @xmath77 pc ) . for simulation b , @xmath78 , @xmath79",
    "when @xmath74 pc ( and @xmath80 , @xmath81 when @xmath82 pc )",
    ". for simulation c , we have @xmath83 , @xmath84 when @xmath85 pc ( and @xmath86 , @xmath87 when @xmath88 pc ) .",
    "the density profiles of the inner regions show a significant steepening compared to the outer regions .",
    "this is likely to be the result of adiabatic contraction , since it occurs at a scale @xmath2  pc where the density of baryons begins to dominate .",
    "we emphasize again that the simulation points on which dm fits # 2 are based correspond to bins with only a small ( @xmath89 ) number of particles and must be treated with caution .",
    "we do note , however , that on the very innermost scales ( @xmath90  pc ) the dark matter density profiles in the numerical simulations are even steeper than the analytic dm fits # 2 .",
    "if adiabatic contraction of dark matter in the baryon - dominated potential is responsible for sculpting these profiles , one expects that the maximum steepness of the dark matter density profile will be equal to that of the baryons , which has been shown in simulations to have an approximate power law profile of @xmath91 ( see  [ s : baryon ] ) .",
    "the baryonic density profile inevitably flattens in its center , so that the power law profile is only valid inwards to some core radius , @xmath92 .",
    "this core radius shrinks as collapse proceeds . in situations where we are interested in the global luminosity provided by wimp annihilation in the halo (  [ s : equilibrium ] ) , we will assume that the dark matter density profile also exhibits this core radius , inside of which its density is also constant .    for the fiducial case , we assume a dark matter particle mass of @xmath93  gev , which is typical for a weakly interacting particle . the photon multiplicity function @xmath94 for the important annihilation channels is given by the form ( bergstrm et al .",
    "1998 ; feng et al . 2001 ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are constants for the particular annihilation channel .",
    "we use the values given in feng , matchev & wilczek ( 2001 ) , and average over the different annihilation channels they considered to obtain @xmath98 .",
    "we set @xmath99 ( e.g. jungman et al .",
    "the heating rate as expressed in equation  [ heating ] was calculated for the above density profiles and is shown in fig .",

    "the variation of @xmath48 on the wimp mass , @xmath13 , is also shown in fig .",
    "we consider cases with @xmath100  gev and 1  tev , i.e. factors of 10 below and above our fiducial value .",
    "once the simple @xmath101 dependence of @xmath48 ( eq .  [ heating ] ) is accounted for , we see that remaining variations in @xmath48 are within about a factor of 2",
    ". these are due to the @xmath13 dependencies of the photon multiplicity function , the energy integral and the @xmath102 function .",
    "it is also informative to compare @xmath48 to the energy generated by wimp annihilation per unit volume , per unit time @xmath103 fig .",
    "[ mass ] compares @xmath104 and @xmath48 for simulation a , for dm fit # 2 . at small distances ( @xmath105 au ) , the two curves are very similar , whereas at larger distances , @xmath106 since not all the energy generated is absorbed .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath48 can exceed @xmath104 at high densities , since unlike @xmath104 , @xmath48 is not a strictly local function of @xmath20 .      in the numerical simulations of oshea & norman ( 2007 ) ,",
    "collapse of baryons was followed with adaptive mesh refinement to much higher spatial resolution than the dark matter .",
    "spatial scales down to @xmath108  au ( comoving ) , i.e. about 10  au ( proper ) , were resolved ( see fig .",
    "[ bar ] ) .",
    "however , in many cases we consider , knowledge of the gas properties is required on even smaller scales .",
    "thus we utilize the results of the even higher resolution smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of yoshida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which were carried out for a single minihalo in which the collapse was followed to higher densities .",
    "the structure of baryonic core is controlled mostly by the microphysics of @xmath107 cooling , in which case one expects a fairly universal profile of density , temperature and chemical composition .    for the hydrogen number density , @xmath109 , we use the analytic fit @xmath110 which is based on conditions at 10  au in the simulation of yoshida et al .",
    "figure  [ bar ] shows this fit is also a good description of the gas in the simulations of oshea & norman ( 2007 ) at @xmath111  au .",

    "collision - induced emission ( cie ) cooling follows the fit published in yoshida et al .",
    ". we also account for the loss of cooling efficiency due to the gas becoming optically thick .",
    "the opacity of the gas to cooling radiation was measured from the results of yoshida et al .",

    "results are also shown as a function of @xmath137 , using equation  [ eq : rho_yoshida ] to derive the density at a given radius .",
    "for the conservative , relatively shallow dark matter density profiles ( fit # 1 ) of simulation a and b and for a fiducial wimp mass of 100  gev , the heating rate is never larger than @xmath138 of the cooling rate for densities up to @xmath4 . in this situation",
    "we expect that the star formation process from these gas cores , in particular the protostellar structure and accretion rate ( e.g. tan & mckee 2004 ) would be unaffected by dark matter annihilation heating .",
    "the expected mass of the stars forming from these halos is then @xmath139 , set by ionizing feedback , especially disk photoevaporation , on the protostellar accretion flow ( mckee & tan 2008 ) .",
    "the case of dm fit # 1 for simulation c is somewhat steeper ( @xmath140 ) than for simulations a and b ( @xmath141 ) , and this leads to the heating rate becoming comparable to the cooling rate at @xmath142 .",
    "this trend is continued for the steeper density profiles of dm fit # 2 , all of which have a central region where wimp annihilation heating dominates over cooling , typically for @xmath143 , i.e. 20  au , and @xmath144 .",
    "one important factor setting this density scale is drop in the cooling efficiency of the gas ( yoshida et al .",
    "2006 , their fig .",
    "4 ) because of the increasing opacity of the gas .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with the those of spolyar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , showing that the properties of the dark matter heating dominated core are relatively insensitive to the details of radiative transport of the wimp annihilation heating that we have included , and that their analytic model for the dark matter density distribution is similar to our dm fit # 2 to simulated minihalos ( see also freese et al .",
    "2008b ) .    the expected consequence of a central core where dark matter heating of the gas dominates its radiative cooling is a halt to the collapse .",
    "this process would then set the core radius , @xmath92 , for both the dark matter and baryon density distributions . to evaluate this core radius and the total luminosity of the equilibrium structure , we now consider the enclosed luminosity profile , @xmath145 , of the halos , defined for wimp annihilation heating as @xmath146 and for baryonic cooling as @xmath147 the luminosity due to wimp annihilation will be dominated by the central part of the halo for @xmath148 ( eq .  [ g ] ) , which is the case for all dm fits # 2 .",
    "we solve for the core radius , @xmath92 , for each simulation via the condition @xmath149 , i.e. @xmath150 this is an equilibrium condition in the sense that the energy generation rate by dark matter annihilation heating balances that radiated away by the baryons .",
    "note that for the profiles analyzed here , both heating and cooling luminosities are dominated by the central regions , i.e. the integrals converge to a finite value as @xmath151 .",
    "note also that local heating will dominate local cooling in an inner region that is somewhat larger than @xmath92 , and cooling will dominate heating outside of this region .",

    "a with @xmath100  gev and 1  tev , we find @xmath157  au , respectively , @xmath158 , respectively , and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "the constancy of these total luminosities is set by the baryonic cooling luminosity , which is dominated by the region from @xmath160  au to @xmath161  au , and is independent of the much smaller core radius , which adjusts itself so as to provide enough wimp annihilation luminosity to match that radiated away by the baryons .",
    "we note our solution has made the approximation that the baryonic properties used to estimate @xmath152 do not include the effects of wimp annihilation heating .",
    "this effect would lead to hotter temperatures and more efficient cooling , so that the actual equilibrium structure would be somewhat smaller and denser .",
    "energy transport from the hotter inner part of the halo to the outer cooler part , either via convection or radiation , would be needed to set up a hydrodynamic equilibrium : i.e. a dark matter powered ( proto)star .",
    "the size of this star would be set by the @xmath162 surface , beyond which the energy flux from the interior is free to escape .",
    "the results of yoshida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) imply that the cooling efficiency has dropped to 0.1 by the time @xmath163 , corresponding to about 30  au .",
    "this is an approximate upper limit to the initial size of the protostar , since the actual gas temperature will be somewhat hotter and a larger fraction of the radiated energy would be in the continuum ( as opposed to line radiation ) .",
    "since there is a large mass reservoir at large @xmath20 that is undergoing cooling , baryons will continue to accrete to the central protostar , deepening the gravitational potential and thus causing more dark matter to be concentrated here also . for simulation",
    "a , dm fit#2 and @xmath93  gev with @xmath164  au , the mass inside @xmath92 is 0.17  @xmath165 , and the accretion rate is close to @xmath166 with infall speeds of about 4  @xmath167 ( yoshida et al .",
    "2006 ) , which are mildly supersonic .",
    "as the central mass grows , the infall is expected to become more supersonic , i.e. closer to the free fall speed of the central protostellar mass at its surface .",
    "the detailed evolution of this dark matter powered protostar is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "freese et al . ( 2008c ) have considered the protostellar structure of such stars , but starting from a more evolved stage when @xmath168 and for @xmath169 .",
    "after 4,500  yr of accretion this initial structure has grown in mass to 12  @xmath165 and has a radius of 2.8  au and a luminosity of @xmath170 ( ignoring accretion luminosity ) . the dark matter in the star",
    "is assumed to increase via adiabatic contraction of the surrounding halo and enough luminosity is provided by dark matter annihilation to support stars of at least 1000  @xmath165 , for which @xmath171 .",
    "being much larger and cooler than protostars on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , these dark matter powered protostars are expected to have relatively weak radiative feedback on their accretion envelopes and thus may be able to attain very high masses .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the baryonic mass of the star grows more rapidly than the enclosed dark matter mass and that this more massive star is unable to be supported by wimp annihilation luminosity .",
    "the star contracts and reaches central densities and temperatures at which nuclear fusion of h starts .",
    "note that fiducial models of population iii.1 protostars ( e.g. omukai & palla 2003 ; tan & mckee 2004 ) do not expect contraction to the main sequence until @xmath172 , i.e. when the kelvin - helmholz time becomes less than the accretion growth time .",
    "the critical feedback process , disk photoevaporation , theorized to limit the masses of pop iii.1 stars is expected to truncate protostellar growth along the zams at about @xmath173 , depending on the accretion rate ( mckee & tan 2008 ) .",
    "thus if wimp annihilation were able to support the protostar only up to @xmath174 , there would be only modest implications for the initial mass function of the first stars .",
    "understanding the accumulation of dark matter by the protostar is of critical importance for deciding between these two scenarios .",
    "there are processes and effects that can cause inefficient adiabatic contraction of the dark matter halo in response to protostellar accretion .",
    "rapid free - fall collapse of the baryons joining the star - disk system is expected after the expansion wave moves out .",
    "standard analytic analyses of adiabatic contraction typically assume very slow changes in the baryonic potential ( e.g. blumenthal et al . 1986 ) . for rapid collapse , one expects a delayed response of the dark matter , and during this time @xmath175",
    "will have decreased .",
    "another effect is excitation of the dark matter velocity dispersion by scattering with baryonic density fluctuations .",
    "these will probably occur most strongly in the accretion disk around the protostar , since such fluctuations are required for angular momentum transport , and , if not initially present , will inevitably develop via gravitational instability as the disk mass grows ( tan & blackman 2004 ) . for accretion from a core with a given density and angular momentum , the disk size can be described via ( tan & mckee 2004 ) : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the ratio of the rotational to keplerian velocities of the gas at the sonic point of the infall and has a fiducial value of 0.5 in the simulations of abel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , @xmath178 is the mass of central protostar and its disk ( we typically assume a disk mass that is one third of the protostellar mass ) , and @xmath179 is the normalized entropy parameter ( related to the density of the core at the time of protostar formation : a denser core has a larger value of @xmath179 ) , with fiducial value of 1.0 . we see that the expected disk sizes when the central mass is @xmath180 are @xmath181  au .",
    "most mass will join the dark matter powered protostar via a disk once @xmath182  a few solar masses .",
    "if the initial protostar fails to accumulate any addition dark matter and retains what it has during kelvin - helmholz contraction ( which is expected since the contraction time is much longer than the dynamical time ) , then , ignoring depletion ( discussed below , but which occurs on timescales much longer than the initial accretion growth time ) , the wimp annihilation luminosity of the star is approximately described by @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185  au are fiducial values for the initial luminosity and radius of the star , respectively , and assuming homologous evolution of the density profile .",
    "the protostellar size in models with @xmath186 is expected to be @xmath2  au for @xmath187 ( tan & mckee 2004 ) .",
    "compressing a protostar to this size would lead to @xmath188 for the above starting conditions , which is enough luminosity to support a @xmath174 star .",
    "so in this case the protostar would be able to be supported by wimp annihilation giving it @xmath189au sizes until about @xmath190 .",
    "the zams radius of a @xmath190 star is about @xmath191  au , so it is clear that contraction to this scale would not be possible until very large stellar masses , unless the wimp content of the protostar became depleted .",
    "these conclusions are of course sensitive to the initial condition .",
    "we expect @xmath184 to be relatively robust as it is set by the baryonic cooling properties of the halo , but the initial size of the dark matter core that provides this wimp annihilation luminosity depends quite sensitively on the uncertain wimp mass and the spatial distribution of the dark matter .",
    "for example , if the dark matter core has an initial size of about 1  au ( e.g. similar to simulation b , dm fit#2 , @xmath93  gev and models with @xmath192  tev ) and assuming the initial protostellar size scales proportionately and is also about equal to this size , then the potential luminosity available from contraction of the protostar to a given radius would be a thousand times less than the case considered above .",
    "nevertheless , a contraction to @xmath193 from 1  au , would still lead to a wimp annihilation luminosity of @xmath194 .",
    "we now compare the growth time of the protostar ( i.e. the time since its formation , its age ) , + @xmath195 ( tan & mckee 2004 ) to the wimp depletion time : @xmath196 if the protostar contracts from an initial radius of 10  au ( where we find @xmath197,see above ) to 1  au then @xmath198 .",
    "we see that , if replenishment of wimps in the protostar is negligible , then depletion can become important for au scale protostars of @xmath174 .",
    "these timescales are sensitive to @xmath13 and the dark matter density in the initial equilibrium core , which shows significant variation between simulation a , b , and c.",
    "we have investigated the effects of wimp dark matter annihilation on the formation of population iii.1 stars by analyzing the results of cosmological simulations that follow the gravitational collapse of baryons and dark matter .",
    "while these simulations ( oshea & norman 2007 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2006 ) have followed the baryons to very high densities at scales @xmath199  au , the dark matter is only well - resolved down to scales @xmath2  pc .",
    "thus we have considered various power law extrapolations of the dark matter density profile towards the center .",
    "if one assumes the dark matter profile is self - similar , extending inwards from the dark matter dominated regime with @xmath200 and @xmath1 , then , for a fiducial wimp mass of 100  gev , the dark matter annihilation heating is typically negligible ( @xmath201 of the cooling rate ) .",
    "this conclusion would be unchanged for a reduction in the wimp mass by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "one of the simulated minihalos ( c ) exhibits a slightly steeper density profile in the well - resolved region ( @xmath140 , and in this case wimp annihilation heating does become important at @xmath142",
    ".    however , there are theoretical reasons to expect that the dark matter density profile will steepen because of adiabatic contraction in the baryon - dominated core .",
    "indeed , this process appears to be occurring in the simulations of oshea & norman ( 2007 ) , although it is not well - resolved .",
    "a value of @xmath202 appears to be a better description of the dark matter density profile in this region .",
    "for such a profile , and again for a 100  gev particle , the dark matter annihilation heating now exceeds baryonic cooling for densities @xmath203 , in agreement with the previous study of spolyar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we considered the properties of equilibrium halos in which the density distributions of the baryons and dark matter exhibit a constant density central core .",
    "the luminosity that is generated is @xmath204 and is relatively invariant , being set by baryonic cooling processes .",
    "the sizes of the central cores range from @xmath2 to 40  au .",
    "the detailed effects of this extra heating on the protostellar structure remain to be determined .",
    "we expect that subsequent baryonic growth of the protostar will occur more rapidly than its accumulation of dark matter , because the baryons are undergoing rapid free fall collapse followed by disk accretion . however , even if the initial protostar does not gain any additional dark matter , its initial dark matter content in the subsolar mass core could be sufficient to prevent contraction to the zero age main sequence for masses of 100  @xmath165 or greater .",
    "such circumstances could have dramatic implications for the masses of pop iii.1 stars , conceivably raising the mass scale to a regime important for the formation of supermassive black holes .",
    "these conclusions depend sensitively on the initial protostellar core , which now needs to be studied with self - consistent cosmological simulations that include the influence of wimp annihilation heating on the baryons .",
