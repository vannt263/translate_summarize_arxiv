    "the promise of molecular electronics has focused enormous interest on molecular devices .",
    "@xcite typically , such devices consist of an individual molecule trapped between two leads , in - between which a voltage bias is applied . by measuring the current flowing across the molecular bridge one can investigate the molecule s internal degrees of freedom and their coupling to the leads , which can lead in turn to complex many - body physics .",
    "while lacking the exquisite design and control capabilities of semiconductor quantum dots , molecular devices can be produced in large quantities , thus allowing for many samples to be scanned in a relatively short period of time . at the same time",
    ", it is not always clear if a molecule has been successfully trapped between the leads , or whether it might have been damaged or distorted in the course of preparation .    from a basic - science perspective",
    ", single - molecule transistors ( smt ) offer two major advantages over their semiconductor counterparts .",
    "first , the relevant energy scales are notably larger in smts , rendering these scales more accessible to experiments .",
    "second , the electronic degrees of freedom are generally coupled to nuclear vibrational modes , providing an extraordinary opportunity to study the electron - phonon coupling at the nano - scale .",
    "the same picture applies to suspended carbon nanotubes , where the motion of electrons is coupled to vibrations of the tube ( vibrons ) .",
    "indeed , phonon - assisted tunneling can lead to a plethora of interesting phenomena , including the appearance of inelastic steps and peaks in the differential conductance ,  @xcite the frank - condon blockade ,  @xcite and the interplay with the kondo effect .",
    "@xcite while most of the experiments cited above are in general accord with theoretical expectations , some issues , such as the sign of the inelastic steps at integer multiples of the phonon frequency , remain under debate .",
    "@xcite other theoretical predictions awaiting experimental verification include unorthodox variants of the kondo effect ,  @xcite signatures of pair tunneling ,  @xcite and interesting nonequilibrium effects on the phonon distribution function ,  @xcite to name but a few .",
    "while much of the theoretical activity on molecular devices is presently centered on finite - bias transport , in this paper we focus on thermal equilibrium and address a specific question pertaining to the nature of the crossover between two customary limits of phonon - assisted tunneling , the so - called adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes .",
    "these two terms are broadly used in the context of electron - phonon coupling to indicate the limits where the bare electronic motion is either sufficiently fast ( adiabatic limit ) or sufficiently slow ( antiadiabatic limit ) as compared to the phonon vibrations . in the more specific context of resonant phonon - assisted tunneling , the relevant measure of electronic motion",
    "is given by the tunneling rate .",
    "hence , the two limits correspond to whether the bare electronic tunneling rate @xmath0 is either sufficiently small or sufficiently large as compared to the phonon frequency @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath2 ( we work with units in which @xmath3 ) , the phonon can efficiently respond to hopping events by forming a polaron , suppressing thereby the electronic tunneling rate .",
    "this suppression , which can be quite dramatic , is manifest , e.g. , in a narrowing of the tunneling resonance . in the opposite limit , @xmath4",
    ", the phonon is too slow to respond to the frequent tunneling events , having little effect on their rate .",
    "each of these extreme limits is rather well controlled theoretically , either in the framework of the lang - firsov transformation  @xcite or using ordinary perturbation theory in the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "far less understood is the crossover region between the two limits , which lacks a small parameter .",
    "this general picture neglects , however , another important energy scale : the harmonic potential energy associated with the relative displacement of the phonon between different molecular electronic configurations . in the case of a single spinless level with the dimensionless displacement coupling @xmath5",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ h - ep ] ) for an explicit definition of @xmath5 ] , the so - called polaronic shift is given by @xmath7 .",
    "thus , depending on the magnitude of @xmath5 , the polaronic shift @xmath8 may exceed @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 .",
    "quantum mechanically it is natural to associate @xmath8 with a new time scale @xmath9 , which may either be shorter or longer than the electronic dwell time @xmath10 and the period of oscillations @xmath11 . whether @xmath12 has the status of a true physical time scale is not immediately clear .",
    "it can not have real significance for @xmath13 , when the phonon displacement is small as compared to its zero - point motion .",
    "neither does @xmath12 play any role for a classical oscillator , whose period is independent of the amplitude of oscillations . at the same time , @xmath8 does show up as an additional energy scale for phonon - assisted tunneling ,  @xcite although its significance , let alone its role in defining the physical boundaries of the adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes , have never been quite resolved .    from this brief discussion",
    "it is clear that the most interesting and yet most challenging regime is that of strong electron - phonon coupling , @xmath14 , where @xmath12 , whatever its physical interpretation might be , can potentially assume a dominant role .",
    "the interest in strong electron - phonon coupling is further amplified by recent reports of large values of @xmath5 ( including some in excess of 5 ) in suspended carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite in the antiadiabatic limit , the tunneling electrons experience strong polaronic dressing for @xmath14 , reflected in an exponential suppression of the renormalized tunneling rate from @xmath0 to @xmath15 . this dramatic effect raises several basic questions :    1 .",
    "when tuning the bare tunneling rate from weak ( @xmath2 ) to strong ( @xmath4 ) coupling , which physical parameters set the scale for first leaving the polaronic physics of the antiadiabatic regime and then entering the perturbative physics of the adiabatic regime ? are these two transitions governed by a single scale or are there perhaps two distinct scales ? 2 .",
    "how does the ratio @xmath16 evolve from its exponentially small value @xmath17 in the antiadiabatic regime back to approximately one in the adiabatic limit ?",
    "in other terms , how does the polaron get undressed ? 3 .   are there any distinct experimental signatures of the crossover regime that can be detected ?      in this paper , we answer these questions in detail in the framework of the resonant - level model with an additional displacement coupling to a localized vibrational mode [ see eq .",
    "( [ h - ep ] ) ] . besides being one of the most widely used models for single - molecule devices ,",
    "our motivation for adopting this specific hamiltonian is two - fold .",
    "the first is physical clarity , as this hamiltonian constitutes the minimal model where the crossover from the antiadiabatic to the adiabatic regime of phonon - assisted tunneling can be studied without being masked by competing many - body effects ( e.g. , the kondo effect in case of a spinful level ) .",
    "the second point is technical in nature , and pertains to our method of choice for accurate nonperturbative calculations . in this work",
    "we employ wilson s numerical renormalization - group ( nrg ) approach ,  @xcite which is a highly precise tool for calculating equilibrium properties of quantum impurity systems . in the nrg",
    ", the computational effort grows exponentially with the number of conduction - electron species , hence the restriction to a single spinless band allows us to accurately address large values of @xmath5 that otherwise would be inaccessible using more elaborate models .    . upon increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "an extended antiadiabatic regime persists until the renormalized tunneling rate @xmath18 approaches the phonon frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the condition @xmath19 is typically met for @xmath20 with @xmath7 , extending the physics of the antiadiabatic regime far beyond the traditional condition @xmath21 . in terms of the bare model parameters , the extended antiadiabatic regime persists up to @xmath22 .",
    "the perturbative physics of the adiabatic regime is approached only as @xmath0 exceeds @xmath8 , leaving an intermediate crossover region for @xmath23 where the polaron gets progressively undressed .",
    "the phonon configuration strongly deviates in the crossover region from a simple superposition of just one or two coherent states.,width=321 ]    we note in passing that the nrg has been applied to moderately large values of @xmath5 in the framework of the spinful anderson - holstein model ,  @xcite however , these studies used rather large values of the phonon frequency .",
    "the combination of large values of @xmath5 and small phonon frequencies ( as is appropriate for molecular and nanotube devices ) is presently a challenge to treat accurately using the nrg if spin is to be included .",
    "focusing on @xmath14 , fig .",
    "[ fig : e - p ] displays our resulting scenario for the crossover from the antiadiabatic to the adiabatic regime .",
    "in contrast to the naive picture , the crossover is governed primarily by the polaronic shift @xmath8 rather than the phonon frequency @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the perturbative adiabatic limit is approached only as @xmath0 exceeds @xmath8 , leaving a rather broad window of couplings where",
    "@xmath0 well exceeds @xmath1 and yet the physics is basically that of the antiadiabatic regime .",
    "we term this intermediate regime the _ extended antiadiabatic _ regime .",
    "the physical origin of the extended antiadiabatic regime is in the enormous separation of scales between @xmath0 and @xmath24 when @xmath25 .",
    "although smaller than the bare tunneling rate , the phonon frequency @xmath1 remains notably larger than the renormalized one , hence the phonon can still efficiently respond to the individual tunneling events .",
    "the distinction between the extended and the traditional antiadiabatic regimes is therefore quantitative rather than qualitative , both being described by the same fermionic interacting resonant - level model at energies below @xmath1 .",

    "<S> the crossover between two customary limits of phonon - assisted tunneling , the adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes , is studied systematically in the framework of a minimal model for molecular devices : a resonant level coupled by displacement to a localized vibrational mode . </S>",
    "<S> conventionally associated with the limits where the phonon frequency is either sufficiently small or sufficiently large as compared to the bare electronic hopping rate , we show that the crossover between the two regimes is governed for strong electron - phonon interactions primarily by the polaronic shift rather than the phonon frequency . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the perturbative adiabatic limit is approached only as the bare hopping rate @xmath0 exceeds the polaronic shift , leaving an extended window of couplings where @xmath0 well exceeds the phonon frequency and yet the physics is basically that of the antiadiabatic regime . </S>",
    "<S> we term this intermediate regime the extended antiadiabatic regime . </S>",
    "<S> the effective low - energy hamiltonian in the traditional and the extended antiadiabatic regime is shown to be the ( purely fermionic ) interacting resonant - level model , with parameters that we extract from numerical renormalization - group calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the extended antiadiabatic regime is followed in turn by a true crossover region where the polaron gets progressively undressed . in this latter region , </S>",
    "<S> the phonon configuration strongly deviates from a simple superposition of just one or two coherent states . the renormalized tunneling rate , which serves as the low - energy scale in the problem and thus sets the width of the tunneling resonance , is found to follow an approximate scaling form on going from the adiabatic to the antiadiabatic regime . </S>",
    "<S> charging properties are governed by two distinct mechanisms at the extended antiadiabatic and into the crossover region , giving rise to characteristic shoulders in the low - temperature conductance as a function of gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> these shoulders serve as a distinct experimental fingerprint of phonon - assisted tunneling when the electron - phonon coupling is strong . </S>"
