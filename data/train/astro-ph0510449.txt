    "the potential importance of the photon - photon pair production process in high energy astrophysics was first pointed out by nikishov ( 1962 ) before the discovery of the cmb ( 2.7 k cosmic microwave background ) . however , his early paper overestimated the energy density of intergalactic starlight radiation by three orders of magnitude . with the discovery of the cmb , gould & schreder ( 1966 ) and jelly ( 1966 ) showed that the universe would be opaque to @xmath4-raysof energy above 100 tev at extragalactic distances .",
    "stecker ( 1969 ) and fazio & stecker ( 1970 ) included cosmological and redshift effects , showing that photons from a @xmath4-ray   source at a redshift @xmath8 above an energy @xmath9 tev would be significantly absorbed by pair production interactions with the cmb .    following the _ cgro _ ( compton gamma - ray observatory ) discovery of the strongly flaring @xmath4-ray   blazar 3c279 at redshift 0.54 ( hartman _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , and based on earlier calculations by stecker , puget & fazio ( 1977 ) estimating the cib ( cosmic infrared background ) , stecker , de jager & salamon ( 1992 ) proposed that one can use the predicted pair production absorption features in blazars to determine the intensity of the cib , provided that the intrinsic spectra of blazars extend to tev energies .",
    "subsequent work along these lines used observations of tev spectra of blazars to place upper limits on the cib ( stecker & de jager 1993 , 1997 ; dwek & slavin 1994 ; biller _ et al .  _ 1998 ; funk _ et al .",

    "lower limits from galaxy counts help in determining the spectral energy distribution of the cib at wavelengths where no _ cobe _ data are available .",
    "in addition , the upper limits from tev @xmath4-ray   observations and from cib fluctuations help to determine the cib at wavelengths where no direct measurements are available ( see hauser & dwek 2001 for a review of the cib measurements ) . more detailed theoretical models of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the cib produced by cool stars and dust reradiation in galaxies were subsequently constructed ( macminn & primack 1996 ; franceschini _ et al .  _ 1998 ; malkan & stecker 1998 , 2001 ( ms98 , ms01 ) ; kneiske _ et al .",

    "a reported near - ir excess ( matsumoto _ et al .",

    "we do not consider these reported fluxes to be part of the cib .",
    "] , although it should be noted that these data have large error bars .",
    "malkan & stecker ( 2001 ) also used this approach to derive galaxy lfs and source counts at various infrared wavelengths which are found to be in general agreement with present data .",
    "these results have then been used to determine intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) source spectra of well - observed tev blazars which can be shown to be consistent with synchrotron self - compton emission models ( de jager & stecker 2002 ; konopelko _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ; georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ; konopelko , mastichiadas & stecker 2005 ) .",
    "in this way , a synoptic approach to both the @xmath4-ray   and infrared observations can lead to knowledge of both blazar emission and the low energy intergalactic photon background ( dwek & krennrich 2005 ) .    it was pointed out by madau & phinney ( 1996 ) that the optical and ultraviolet radiation produced by stars in galaxies at redshifts out to @xmath10 would make the universe opaque to photons above an energy of @xmath11 gev emitted by sources at a redshift of @xmath10 , again owing to pair production interactions .",
    "salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) ( ss98 ) made detailed calculations of the opacity of @xmath4-raysfrom such interactions down to energies of 10 gev and out to a redshift of 3 .",

    "we will refer to this as the `` intergalactic background light '' ( ibl ) .",
    "we then use our results on the density of the ibl as a function of redshift , together with the opacity of the cmb as a function of redshift , to calculate the opacity of the universe to @xmath4-raysfor energies from 4 gev to 100 tev and for redshifts from @xmath12 to 5 . as an example of the application of our results , we calculate the absorbed spectrum of the blazar pks 2155 - 304 at @xmath13 and compare it with the spectrum observed by the _ h.e.s.s . _",

    "in order to calculate intergalactic ir photon fluxes and densities , we again use the same method described in detail by malkan & stecker ( ms98 , ms01 ) .",
    "this method , a `` backwards evolution '' scheme , is an empirically based calculation of the sed of the cib by using ( 1 ) the luminosity dependent galaxy seds based on observations of normal galaxy ir seds by spinoglio _",

    "_ , its sed , can be predicted statistically from its observed luminosity in one infrared waveband , here chosen to be 60@xmath15 m .",
    "this is founded on the well - established fact that galaxies are more luminous ( now and in the past ) when they have higher rates of recent star formation .",
    "empirically , it is found that for the more luminous galaxies , relatively more of the energy from these young stars is absorbed by dust grains and re - radiated in the thermal ir .",
    "this results in the observational facts that more luminous galaxies have higher ir flux relative to optical flux and warmer ir spectra .",
    "these clear luminosity - dependent trends in galaxy seds were well determined locally from the combination of iras ( infrared astronomy satellite ) and ground based photometry for large ( _ e.g. _ , all sky ) samples .",
    "following our previous work , we use the quantitative measurements of these trends determined by spinoglio _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) and spinolgio , andreani and malkan ( 2002 ) .",
    "the resulting seds as a function of galaxy luminosity are based on broadband photometry of iras selected samples . since then , other computations of ir backgrounds and source counts have used different sets of seds , based on somehwat different combinations of data and models , in some cases estimated in more spectral detail .",
    "we have therefore checked whether these new seds might differ from ours in either overall colors , or in detail around the 712@xmath15 m region , where the strongest spectral features are found .",

    "so long as the agreement for seds near the knee is reasonable , the final computed ir backgrounds will also agree , because they are dominated by galaxies around the knee .    figures [ xunrm9 ] and [ xusbg10 ] compare our computed sed ( solid line ) with the ranges given by xu _",

    "( 1995 ) at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath15 m  ( and our estimates at 2.2 and 3.5 @xmath15 m ) were inverted so that a luminosity at any given rest wavelength could be determined from the 60 @xmath15 m luminosity , @xmath33 .",
    "this allowed us to make a mapping of the 60 @xmath15 m lf shown in figure [ lf ] to an lf at any infrared wavelength using the transformation relation    @xmath34    which ms01 showed were in good agreement with local lfs at other wavelengths .",
    "it is now well known that galaxies had a brighter past owing to their higher rates of star formation and the fading of stellar populations as they age .",
    "the simplest resulting evolution of the galaxy luminosity function is a uniform shift in either the vertical axis ( number density evolution ) , or in the horizontal axis ( luminosity evolution . ) for a pure power - law luminosity function , number and luminosity evolution are mathematically equivalent . in reality , however , to avoid unphysical divergences in the total number or luminosity of galaxies , the luminosity function must steepen at high l and flatten at low l. thus real lf s will have at least one characteristic  knee \" separating the steep high - l portion from the flatter low - l slope ( see figure [ lf ] .",
    "for typical lf s this results in most of the luminosity being emitted by galaxies within an order of magnitude of this knee . thus large uncertainties and errors in the lf",
    "far from this knee will hardly change most of the results ( e.g. , number counts and integrated diffuse backgrounds ) .",
    "strong luminosity evolution of galaxies , _ i.e. _ , a substantial increase in the luminosity of this knee with redshift , is consistently found by many observations relating ir luminosity to the much higher star formation rate at @xmath35 and to the recent determination that most uv - selected galaxies at @xmath35 are also luminous infrared galaxies ( burgarella _ et al .  _ 2006 ) .",
    "in addition to the evolution of galaxy luminosity , some increase in galaxy number density is expected owing to the hierarchical clustering predicted by cold dark matter models . however , luminosity evolution is so strongly dominant that it is difficult to identify a component of density evolution . ms98 and ms01 therefore assumed pure luminosity evolution for their backwards evolution calculations .",
    "even five years later , this is still an excellent description of the latest observations .",
    "the most recent galaxy luminosity functions at higher redshifts show weak evidence for a small number evolution , combined with very strong luminosity evolution .",
    "however , the number evolution is still sufficiently small ( an increase in space density of only a factor of 1.5 to 1.9 times the local value ) , that pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) is nearly as good a fit .",
    "the ple model will be adopted here because it simplifies the calculation and it is quite adequate or the purposes of deriving intergalactic low energy photon densities and spectra .",
    "we base our calculations on two plausible cases of pure luminosity evolution very similar to what ms98 and ms01 assumed :    \\(1 ) in the more conservative scenario , all galaxy 60@xmath15 m luminosities evolved as @xmath36 .",
    "this is the same as in the `` baseline case '' of ms01 and ms98 ( with their luminosity evolution parameter @xmath37 ) , but with evolution stopped at @xmath38 and galaxy luminosities assumed constant ( nonevolving ) at the higher redshifts @xmath39 , with negligible ( assumed zero ) emission for @xmath40 .",

    "this is reflected in the fact that our assumed ple models , when combined with the library of galaxy seds as a function of luminosity ( given explicitly in ms98 ) results in an automatic increase in the ratio of fir ( dust ) to nir ( stellar ) emission from galaxies with redshift .",
