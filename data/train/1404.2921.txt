    "optical networks have traditionally employed three main switching paradigms , namely circuit switching , burst switching , and packet switching , which have extensively studied respective benefits and limitations  @xcite . in order to achieve the predictable network service of circuit switching while enjoying some of the flexibilities of burst and packet switching ,",
    "_ dynamic circuit switching _ has been introduced  @xcite .",
    "dynamic circuit switching can be traced back to research toward differentiated levels of blocking rates of calls  @xcite .",
    "today , a plethora of network applications ranging from the migration of data and computing work loads to cloud storage and computing  @xcite as well as high - bit rate e - science applications , e.g. , for remote scientific collaborations , to big data applications of governments , private organizations , and households are well supported by dynamic circuit switching  @xcite",
    ". moreover , gaming applications benefit from predictable low - delay service  @xcite provided by circuits , as do emerging virtual reality applications  @xcite .",
    "also , circuits can aid in the timely transmission of data from continuous media applications , such as live or streaming video .",
    "video traffic is often highly variable and may require smoothing before transmission over a circuit  @xcite or require a combination of circuit transport for a constant base bit stream and packet switched transport for the traffic burst exceeding the base bit stream rate .",
    "both commercial and research / education network providers have recently started to offer optical dynamic circuit switching services  @xcite .    while dynamic circuit switching has received growing research attention in core and metro networks  @xcite , mechanisms for supporting dynamic circuit switching in passive optical networks ( pons ) , which are a promising technology for network access  @xcite , are largely an open research area . as reviewed in section  [ lit : sec ] , pon research on the upstream transmission direction from the distributed optical network units ( onus ) to the central optical line terminal ( olt )",
    "has mainly focused on mechanisms supporting packet - switched transport  @xcite . while some of these packet - switched transport mechanisms support quality of service akin to circuits through service differentiation mechanisms , to the best of our knowledge",
    "there has been no prior study of circuit - level performance in pons , e.g. , the blocking probability of circuit requests for a given circuit request rate and circuit holding time .    in this article , we present the first circuit - level performance study of a pon with polling - based medium access control .",
    "we make three main original contributions towards the concept of efficiently supporting both * * dy**namic * * c**ircuit * * a**nd * * p**acket traffic in the upstream direction on a * pon * , which we refer to as * dycappon * :    * we propose a novel dycappon polling cycle structure that exploits the dynamic circuit transmissions to mask the round - trip propagation delay for dynamic bandwidth allocation to packet traffic . * we develop a stochastic knapsack - based model of dycappon to evaluate the circuit - level performance , including the blocking probabilities for different classes of circuit requests .",
    "* we analyze the bandwidth sharing between circuit and packet traffic in dycappon and evaluate packet - level performance , such as mean packet delay , as a function of the circuit traffic .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we first review related work in section  [ lit : sec ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe the considered access network structure and define both the circuit and packet traffic models as well as the corresponding circuit- and packet - level performance metrics . in section  [ dycappon : sec ] , we introduce the dycappon polling cycle structure and outline the steps for admission control of dynamic circuit requests and dynamic bandwidth allocation to packet traffic . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we analyze the performance metrics relating to the dynamic circuit traffic , namely the blocking probabilities for the different circuit classes .",
    "we also analyze the bandwidth portion of a cycle consumed by active circuits , which in turn determines the bandwidth portion available for packet traffic , and analyze the resulting mean delay for packet traffic . in section  [ eval : sec ]",
    "we validate numerical results from our analysis with simulations and present illustrative circuit- and packet - level performance results for dycappon .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] and outline future research directions towards the dycappon concept .",
    "the existing research on upstream transmission in passive optical access networks has mainly focused on packet traffic and related packet - level performance metrics .",
    "a number of studies has primarily focused on differentiating the packet - level qos for different classes of packet traffic , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these studies , we consider only best effort service for the packet traffic in this article . in future work",
    ", mechanisms for differentiation of packet - level qos could be integrated into the packet partition ( see section  [ dycappon : sec ] ) of the dycappon polling cycle .",
    "the needs of applications for transmission with predictable quality of service has led to various enhancements of packet - switched transport for providing quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "a few studies , e.g. ,  @xcite , have specifically focused on providing deterministic qos , i.e. , absolute guarantees for packet - level performance metrics , such as packet delay or jitter .",
    "several studies have had a focus on the efficient integration of deterministic qos mechanisms with one or several lower - priority packet traffic classes in polling - based pons , e.g.,@xcite .",
    "the resulting packet scheduling problems have received particular attention  @xcite . generally , these prior studies have found that fixed - duration polling cycles are well suited for supporting consistent qos service .",
    "similar to prior studies , we employ fixed - duration polling cycles in dycappon , specifically on a pon with a single - wavelength upstream channel .",
    "the prior studies commonly considered traffic flows characterized through leaky - bucket parameters that bound the long - term average bit rate as well as the size of sudden traffic bursts .",
    "most of these studies include admission control , i.e. , admit a new traffic flow only when the packet - level performance guarantees can still be met with the new traffic flow added to the existing flows . however , the circuit - level performance , i.e. , the probability of blocking ( i.e. , denial of admission ) of a new request has not been considered .",
    "in contrast , the circuits in dycappon provide absolute qos to constant bit rate traffic flows without bursts and we analyze the probability of new traffic flows ( circuits ) being admitted or blocked .",
    "this flow ( circuit ) level performance is important for network dimensioning and providing qos at the level of traffic flows .    for completeness",
    ", we briefly note that a pon architecture that can provide circuits to onus through orthogonal frequency division multiplexing techniques on the physical layer has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "our study , in contrast , focuses on efficient medium access control techniques for supporting circuit traffic .",
    "a qos approach based on burst switching in a pon has been proposed in  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "circuit level performance in pons has so far only been examined in  @xcite for the specific context of optical code division multiplexing  @xcite .",
    "we also note for completeness that large file transmissions in optical networks have been examined in  @xcite , where scheduling of large data file transfers on the optical grid network is studied , in  @xcite , where parallel transfer over multiple network paths are examined , and in  @xcite , where files are transmitted in a burst mode , i.e. , sequentially .",
    "sharing of a general time - division multiplexing ( tdm ) link by circuit and packet traffic has been analyzed in several studies , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these queueing theoretic analyses typically employed detailed markov models and become computationally quite demanding for high - speed links . also , these complex existing models considered a given node with local control of all link transmissions . in contrast , we develop a simple performance model for the distributed transmissions of the onus that are coordinated through polling - based medium access control in dycappon .",
    "our dycappon model is accurate for the circuits and approximate for the packet service .",
    "more specifically , we model the dynamics of the circuit traffic , which is given priority over packet traffic up to an aggregate circuit bandwidth of @xmath2 in dycappon , with accurate stochastic knapsack modeling techniques in section  [ percir : sec ] . in section  [ pkt_perf : sec ] , we present an approximate delay model for the packet traffic , which in dycappon can consume the bandwidth left unused by circuit traffic .",

    "initially we ignore delay variations , i.e. , we consider that a given circuit with bit rate @xmath46 has a fixed position for the transmission of its @xmath110 bits in each cycle .",
    "three delay components arise : the `` accumulation / dispersal '' delay of @xmath19 for the @xmath110 bits of circuit traffic that are transmitted per cycle .",
    "note that the first bit arriving to form a `` chunk '' of @xmath110 bits experiences the delay @xmath19 at the onu , waiting for subsequent bits to `` fill up ( accumulate ) '' the chunk . the last bit of a chunk experiences essentially no delay at the onu , but has to wait for a duration of @xmath19 at the olt to `` send out ( disperse ) '' the chunk at the circuit bit rate @xmath46 .",

    "when an ongoing circuit is closing down or a new circuit is established , it may become necessary to rearrange the transmission positions of the circuits in the cycle in order to keep all circuit transmissions within the circuit partition at the beginning of the cycle and avoid idle times during the circuit partition .",

    "note that for a given circuit service limit @xmath2 , the worst - case delay variation for a given circuit with rate @xmath46 is less than @xmath112 as the circuit could at the most shift from the beginning to the end of the circuit partition of maximum duration @xmath113 .        inserting the circuit partition duration @xmath20 from ( [ xin : eqn ] ) into the expression for the aggregate limit @xmath91 on the transmission window for packets in a cycle from ( [ gp : eqn ] ) and taking the expectation @xmath114",

    "we present for stable packet service an approximate analysis of the mean delay @xmath27 of packets transmitted during the packet partition . in dycappon ,",
    "packets are transmitted on the bandwidth that is presently not occupied by admitted circuits .",
    "thus , fluctuations in the aggregate occupied circuit bandwidth @xmath25 affect the packet delays . if the circuit bandwidth @xmath25 is presently high , packets experience longer delays than for presently low circuit bandwidth @xmath25 .",
    "the aggregated occupied circuit bandwidth @xmath25 fluctuates as circuits are newly admitted and occupy bandwidth and as existing circuits reach the end of their holding time and release their occupied bandwidth .",
    "the time scale of these fluctuations of @xmath25 increases as the average circuit holding time @xmath13 increases , i.e. , as the circuit departure rate @xmath120 decreases ( and correspondingly , the circuit request arrival rate @xmath121 decreases for a given fixed circuit traffic load @xmath122 )  @xcite .    for circuit holding times that are orders of magnitude larger than the typically packet delays ( service times ) in the system , the fluctuations of the circuit bandwidth @xmath25 occur at a significantly longer ( slower ) time scale than the packet service time scale .",
    "that is , the bandwidth @xmath25 occupied by circuits exhibits significant correlations over time which in turn give rise to complex correlations with the packet queueing delay  @xcite .",
    "for instance , packets arriving during a long period of high circuit bandwidth may experience very long queueing delays and are possibly only served after some circuits release their bandwidth . as illustrated in section  [ mu_impact : sec ] , the effects of these complex correlations become significant for scenarios with moderate to long circuit holding times @xmath13 when the circuit traffic load is low to moderate relative to the circuit bandwidth limit @xmath2 ( so that pronounced circuit bandwidth fluctuations are possible ) , and the packet traffic load on the remaining bandwidth of approximately @xmath123 is relatively high , so that substantial packet queue build - up can occur .",
    "we leave a detailed mathematical analysis of the complex correlations occurring in these scenarios in the context of dycappon for future research .    in the present study ,",
    "we focus on an approximate packet delay analysis that neglects the outlined correlations .",
    "we base our approximate packet delay analysis on the expectation @xmath124 $ ] ( [ ebeta : eqn ] ) , i.e. , we linearly weigh packet delay metrics @xmath125 with the probability masses @xmath24 for the aggregate circuit bandwidth @xmath25 .",
    "we also neglect the `` low - load '' operating mode of section  [ lowload : sec ] in the analysis .",

    "we include a delay component of half the mean duration of the packet partition @xmath133 to account for the delay of the reporting of a particular onu to the end of the packet partition .",
    "the delay from the end of the packet partition in one cycle to the beginning of the packet partition of the next cycle is the maximum of the roundtrip propagation delay @xmath51 and the mean duration of the circuit partition @xmath20 .",

    "we model the circuit partitions , when the upstream channel is not serving packet traffic , through scaling of the packet traffic intensity .",
    "in particular , the upstream channel is available for serving packet traffic only for the mean fraction @xmath140 of a cycle .",
    "thus , for large backlogs served across several cycles , the packet traffic intensity during the packet partition is effectively @xmath141 hence , the mean queueing delay is approximately @xmath142 thus , the overall mean packet delay is approximately @xmath143",
    "we consider an epon with @xmath144 onus , a channel bit rate @xmath145  gb / s , and a cycle duration @xmath146  ms .",

    "[ fig : cc ] we examine the impact of the transmission rate limit @xmath2 for circuit traffic .",

    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : cc](a ) that the average circuit blocking probability @xmath158 steadily decreases for increasing @xmath2 . in the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc ] , the average circuit blocking probability @xmath158 drops to negligible values below 1  % for @xmath2 values corresponding to roughly twice the offered circuit traffic load @xmath122 .",
    "for instance , for circuit load @xmath159 , @xmath158 drops to 0.9  % for @xmath160  gb / s .",
    "the limit @xmath2 thus provides an effective parameter for controlling the circuit blocking probability experienced by customers .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : cc](b ) , we observe that the mean packet delay abruptly increases when the @xmath2 limit reduces the packet traffic portion @xmath151 of the upstream transmission bandwidth to values near the packet traffic intensity @xmath118 .",
    "we also observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : cc](b ) that the approximate packet delay analysis is quite accurate for small to moderate @xmath2 values ( the slight delay overestimation is due to neglecting the low packet traffic polling ) , but underestimates the packet delays for large @xmath2 .",
    "large circuit traffic limits @xmath2 give the circuit traffic more flexibility for causing fluctuations of the occupied circuit bandwidth , which deteriorate the packet service . summarizing , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : cc](b ) that as the effective packet traffic intensity @xmath161 approaches one , the mean packet delay increases sharply .",
    "thus , for ensuring low - delay packet service , the limit @xmath2 should be kept sufficiently below @xmath162 .",
    "when offering circuit and packet service over shared pon upstream transmission bandwidth , network service providers need to trade off the circuit blocking probabilities and packet delays . as we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : cc ] , the circuit bandwidth limit @xmath2 provides an effective tuning knob for controlling this trade - off .       as a function of packet traffic load @xmath118 . ]    the fig .",

    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : lm ] that low - packet - traffic mode polling substantially reduces the mean packet delay compared to conventional polling for low packet traffic loads .",
    "this delay reduction is achieved by the the more frequent polling which serves packets quicker in cycles with low load due to circuit traffic .",
    "we have proposed and evaluated dycappon , a passive optical network that provides dynamic circuit and packet service .",
    "dycappon is based on fixed duration cycles , ensuring consistent circuit service , that is completely unaffected by the packet traffic load .",
    "dycappon masks the round - trip propagation delay for polling of the packet traffic queues in the onus with the upstream circuit traffic transmissions , providing for efficient usage of the upstream bandwidth .",
    "we have analyzed the circuit level performance , including the circuit blocking probability and delay experienced by circuit traffic in dycappon , as well as the bandwidth available for packet traffic after serving the circuit traffic .",
    "we have also conducted an approximate analysis of the packet level performance .    through extensive numerical investigations based on the analytical performance characterization of dycappon as well as verifying simulations",
    ", we have demonstrated the circuit and packet traffic performance and trade - offs in dycappon .",
    "the provided analytical performance characterizations as well as the identified performance trade - offs provide tools and guidance for dimensioning and operating pon access networks that provide a mix of circuit and packet oriented service .",
    "there are several promising directions for future research on access networks that flexibly provide both circuit and packet service .",
    "one important future research direction is to broadly examine cycle - time structures and wavelength assignments in pons providing circuit and packet service . in particular , the present study focused on a single upstream wavelength channel operated with a fixed polling cycle duration .",
    "future research should examine the trade - offs arising from operating multiple upstream wavelength channels and combinations of fixed- or variable - duration polling cycles .",
    "an exciting future research direction is to extend the pon service further toward the individual user , e.g. , by providing circuit and packet service on integrated pon and wireless access networks , such as  @xcite , that reach individual mobile users or wireless sensor networks  @xcite .",
    "further , exploring combined circuit and packet service in long - reach pons with very long round trip propagation delays , which may require special protocol mechanisms , see e.g. ,  @xcite , is an open research direction .",
    "another direction is to examine the integration and interoperation of circuit and packet service in the pon access network with metropolitan area networks  @xcite and wide area networks to provide circuit and packet service  @xcite .      in this appendix , we present the recursive kaufman - roberts algorithm  @xcite for computing the equilibrium probabilities @xmath163 that the currently active circuit occupy an aggregated bandwidth @xmath25 . for",
    "the execution of the algorithm , the given circuit bandwidths @xmath164 and limit @xmath2 are suitably normalized so that incrementing @xmath25 in integer steps covers all possible combinations of the circuit bandwidth .",
    "for instance , in the evaluation scenario considered in section  [ eval_setup : sec ] , all circuit bandwidth are integer multiples of 52 mb / s .",
    "thus , we normalize all bandwidths by 52 mb / s and for e.g. , @xmath160  gb / s execute the following algorithm for @xmath165 .",
    "( the variables @xmath166 , and @xmath25 refer to their normalized values , e.g. , @xmath167 for the @xmath160  gb / s example , in the algorithm below ) .",

    "<S> dynamic circuits are well suited for applications that require predictable service with a constant bit rate for a prescribed period of time , such as cloud computing and e - science applications . </S>",
    "<S> past research on upstream transmission in passive optical networks ( pons ) has mainly considered packet - switched traffic and has focused on optimizing packet - level performance metrics , such as reducing mean delay . </S>",
    "<S> this study proposes and evaluates a dynamic circuit and packet pon ( dycappon ) that provides dynamic circuits along with packet - switched service . </S>",
    "<S> dycappon provides @xmath0 flexible packet - switched service through dynamic bandwidth allocation in periodic polling cycles , and @xmath1 consistent circuit service by allocating each active circuit a fixed - duration upstream transmission window during each fixed - duration polling cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze circuit - level performance metrics , including the blocking probability of dynamic circuit requests in dycappon through a stochastic knapsack - based analysis . through this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the bandwidth occupied by admitted circuits . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining bandwidth is available for packet traffic and we conduct an approximate analysis of the resulting mean delay of packet traffic . through extensive numerical evaluations and verifying simulations we demonstrate the circuit blocking and packet delay trade - offs in dycappon .    dynamic circuit switching ; ethernet passive optical network ; grant scheduling ; grant sizing ; packet delay ; stochastic knapsack . </S>"
