    "as our ability to acquire and archive data in all fields rapidly grows , the tools for searching these data for pattern , order , and ultimately meaning , need to grow commensurately .",
    "a critical issue in this ongoing paradigm shift is that of multivariate data with complex , hidden geometric structure . color - color or cc diagrams ( which provide spectral information over different energy ranges ) and color - intensity or ci diagrams ( which show brightness variations for a given color ) are common and easily obtained measurements that have long been used to classify x - ray binary types .",
    "@xcite plotted all x - ray binaries observed by the heao-1 satellite on one cc plot ; they found that systems containing black holes clustered in one corner of their diagram and pulsars clustered in an opposing corner . while they found significant overlap of several classes of object in the center they were able to use this clustering to identify new bhc candidates . in vrtilek & boroson ( 2013 ; hereafter vb13 ) we show that when cc and ci are combined into a three dimensional cci plot , different types of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) separate into complex but geometrically distinct volumes .",
    "vb13 model the volumes crudely by computing a centroid and constructing an ellipsoid around the centroid that contains 50 percent of all points while minimizing the volume of the ellipsoid .",
    "we suggest that these diagrams provide an easily used , model - independent way to separate classes of systems , in particular systems containing black holes from those containing neutron stars or systems that can produce jets from those that can not . as a next step towards understanding the physical mechanisms behind this separation of compact object types",
    "we have developed a probabilistic ( bayesian ) model which provides a supervised learning approach : unknown classifications of xrbs are predicted given known classifications .",
    "we provide the astronomer with ` r ` code that takes as input cci data and outputs the estimated probabilities that a system is a black hole , pulsar , or non - pulsing x - ray binary system , in addition to standard errors for these estimates .",
    "this software provides the astronomer with more information than an off the shelf machine learning solution because such a method typically produces point estimates for the classes of the observations , as opposed to an entire distribution for the classes of the observations .    in section 2",
    "we describe the data used ; in section 3 we specify the models we have used for estimating the probabilities that the compact object type of an x - ray binary system is a black hole , non - pulsing neutron star , or pulsar . in section 4",
    "we present our results and their implications and in section 5 we conclude with a summary and future directions for this work .",
    "data on x - ray binaries were obtained by the all sky monitor ( asm ) @xcite on board nasa s rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) which operated continuously for nearly fifteen years . due to",
    "as yet uncalibrated gain changes in the instrument over the last two years of its life , we use only data obtained within the first 13 years .",
    "the mit asm team provides the data in three energy bins ( 1.3 - 3.0kev ; 3.0 - 5.0kev ; 5.0 - 12.0kev . )",
    "sampled 4 - 8 times a day .",
    "we take one day averages and define our colors as ratios of mid to low energy range ( c1 ) and high to low energy range ( c2 ) .",
    "the sum of the three energy bands is used to represent the intensity of the source ; this value is normalized by dividing the total counts by the average of the top 1 percent of the data for any given source . these form",
    "a three - tuple consisting of the features , or background covariates in statistical terms , for each of the observations .",
    "note that since these features are defined in terms of ratios of counts , they are unitless .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to detections that have a signal to noise of at least five , where signal to noise is defined as the ratio of the number of counts in a particular bin to the error on the number of counts .",
    "1 shows an example of a cci diagram constructed with three types of x - ray binaries .",
    "the classificaton of x - ray binaries is not simple and different authors tend to use different criteria",
    ". for our training set we used 24 systems whose classifications are robust , that is they are consistent over numerous authors . in particular we first considered the classifications from the catalogs of @xcite .",
    "we then used @xcite identifications of confirmed black hole systems , @xcite identifications of z and atoll sources , and @xcite identifications of accreting pulsars .",
    "we excluded any of the above types that were also identified as bursters as these vary from author to author .",
    "this left us with 9 systems containing confirmed black holes ( cyg x-1 , lmc x-1 , j1118 + 480 , j1550 - 564 , j1650 - 500 , j1655 - 40 , gx 339 - 4 , j1859 + 226 , grs 1915 + 105 ) , 9 confirmed pulsars ( j0352 + 309 , j1901 + 03 , j1947 + 300 , j2030 + 375 , j1538 - 522 , cen x-3 , her x-1 , smc x-1 , vela x-1 ) , and 6 non - pulsing neutron star systems ( sco x-1 , cyg x-2 , gx 17 + 2 , gx 349 + 2 , gx 9 + 1 , gx 9 + 9 ) .",
    "we test our model by predicting the compact object type of three groups of systems .",
    "the first contains 6 systems whose type is unambiguously classified : one confirmed black hole ( lmc x-3 ) ; one non - pulsing neutron star system ( gx 5 - 1 ) ; and 4 pulsing neutron star systems ( 1744 - 28 , 0656 - 072 , 0535 + 262 , 0115 + 634 ) .",
    "the second group of systems contain stars that are classified as both burster and atoll sources ( ser x-1 , aql x-1 , 1916 - 053 , 1608 - 522 , 1254 - 69 , and 0614 + 091 ) and hence have possibly ambiguous classifications .",
    "the third group of systems are sources that are either unclassified or have multiple classifications across various authors ( 1900 - 245 , gx 3 + 1,1701 - 462 , 1636 - 53 , and 1700 - 37 ) .",
    "the training data set consists of 40857 observations after the preprocessing steps delineated above , of which 13098 come from black hole systems , 25366 come from non - pulsing neutron star systems , and 2393 come from pulsing star systems .",
    "the imbalance in observations between different compact star types is due to the fact that brighter sources are more likely to be detected than weak sources yet the brightness of sources is not uniform amongst star systems .",
    "see figure 2 comparing brightness for various systems .    because observations that are less bright are inherently more likely to be below the signal to noise threshold that we utilized in preprocessing , the data are not missing at random @xcite .",
    "the imbalance in observation types by system is problematic because visual inspection of systems of the same compact object type indicates substantial variability between systems ; hence it is prudent to ensure that the true variation of cci values for each compact object is accurately reflected in the training set . for instance , see figure 3 for a visualization of the variance between systems that are black holes .",
    "additionally the model we employ for generating multiple imputations , discussed in the next section , involves a gaussian process and hence can be quite computationally expensive to work with , generally scaling with computations that take @xmath0 time where @xmath1 is the number of data points in the data set .",
    "one solution to mitigate both of these issues is to subsample the training set where the probability that a particular observation is selected for inclusion in the smaller training set is inversely proportional to the total number of observations of its system in the entire training set .",
    "we sample 10 percent of the training data in this manner , without replacement , to achieve a final training set consisting of 4085 observations , of which 1486 come from black hole systems , 1465 come from non - pulsing neutron star systems , and 1134 come from pulsing neutron star systems .",
    "the histograms in figure 4 show the balance between various systems before and after subsampling .",
    "our approach estimates the probabilities that the compact object type of an xrb is a black hole , non - pulsing neutron star , or pulsar from posterior predictions of the compact object type associated with cci observations within the system .",
    "this approach is similar to the multiple imputations methodology developed in the context of survey analysis , where the proper handling of missing data is crucial for obtaining valid statistical inferences , which is discussed in further detail by @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the multiple draws from the predictive distribution of compact object type allow the astronomer to make a judgement about her or his belief about what the compact object type of a given system is , and provide more information than a point prediction .",
    "the salient property of this approach is that it takes into account the inherent uncertainty in the prediction for each individual observation , and a concrete illustration of the output of this methodology is displayed in the results section . for more on applied bayesian data analysis ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the astronomer s probability model for the compact object of observations from a particular system is a trinomial model , where the relevant estimands are the probabilities that the compact object type is a black hole , non - pulsing neutron star , or pulsar .",
    "the astronomer s objective is to estimate these probabilities given the compact object type for all observations within the system .",
    "note that by employing a model which is not a constant , the astronomer is implicitly modeling  imputer noise \" : in principle the compact object type of a system should be constant for all observations from that system , so the probability model employed by the astronomer is not physically correct , yet a pragmatic solution to allow for the ( inevitable ) mistakes made by an imputer . indeed it would be unrealistic to assume any probabilistic model to be accurate all of the time .",
    "next we describe the probabilistic ( bayesian ) model used to generate predictions for the compact object type of cci observations .",
    "we denote the training set as the 2-tuple @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an @xmath4 by 3 matrix consisting of the three cci values of the training points , and @xmath5 is a length @xmath4 vector of labels 1,2 , or 3 corresponding to the compact object type of the system each individual data point comes from : more precisely 1 represents a black hole system , 2 represents a non - pulsing neutron star system , and 3 represents a pulsing system .",
    "the test set is denoted by @xmath6 which is an @xmath7 by 3 matrix that contains the cci values of observations from a single system we would like to predict the compact object type of , and we write @xmath8 to indicate the labels for the observations from the system .",
    "the model aims to predict the unknown vector @xmath8 , and from this estimate the probabilities that the compact object type is a black hole , pulsar or non - pulsar . from this point of view , @xmath8 is the inferential object of interest and the remaining parameters discussed are nuisance parameters , meaning that they exist for the mathematics of the probabilistic model employed but are not of ultimate inferential interest .",
    "we introduce three independent latent variables for each compact object type ( black hole , non - pulsar , and pulsar ) whose marginal distribution is a gaussian process with mean 0 and covariance matrix @xmath9 which has a squared exponential kernel , a standard choice in the computer experiments and machine learning literature , which is discussed in detail by @xcite , i.e. @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath12 row of the data matrix @xmath13 for which the first @xmath4 rows are the rows of @xmath3 and the rows from @xmath14 to @xmath15 contain the rows of @xmath6 . each latent variable is tied to the compact object type through a multinomial logistic link function : the probability of a particular observation @xmath16 to be of a class @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 have independent unit normal marginal distributions , and @xmath21 is the latent variable drawn corresponding to type @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath22 , where the first @xmath4 elements correspond to the training points , @xmath23 for short , and remaining elements correspond to the prediction test points , @xmath24 for short .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is the mean offset for the latent gaussian process corresponding to compact object type @xmath17 , and the parameter @xmath20 is indicative of the marginal effect that each latent variable has on the propensity of a data point to be of type @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to recapitulate that since we are interested in predicting the vector of compact object types @xmath8 , these additional parameters introduced ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) in our model are ultimately marginalized out ( i.e. forgotten ) as nuisance parameters .",
    "the likelihood of the observed labels given the latent variables and remaining nuisance parameters takes a multinomial form : @xmath25/n_{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the normalizing constant @xmath26 is given by @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for notational brevity , denote the posterior distribution of the vector @xmath8 , @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "then by the definition of conditional probability and marginalization we have the following integral representation for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 note that we purposely overload the @xmath32 notation and use the dash symbol to represent  all other variables \" , for less clutter .",
    "this decomposition suggests an iterative algorithm described in the appendix for sampling from the posterior distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "here we present the prediction of the compact object types of those systems in the test set discussed in section 2 using the model and algorithm discussed in section 3 .",
    "the predicted class of an xrb is the one with the maximum estimated probability , an approach which can be justified from a decision theoretic view point because the posterior mode is bayes estimator under a 0 - 1 loss function , a reasonable loss function for a classification problem .",
    "the class with the maximum estimated probability is mathematically equivalent to the class with the maximum number of posterior predictive draws for the class labels : i.e. , the posterior predictive mode .",
    "table 1 lists the predictions for the 6 systems whose classifications are known in addition to probability estimates and associated standard errors . using this scheme",
    "there are no misclassifications for this group of x - ray binary systems .",
    "additionally in table 2 we include the predictions and probability estimates for  burster \" non - pulsing systems , for which there are a number of wrong predictions : 4 out of 6 systems . in all cases these systems are mistaken for containing black holes .",
    "visual inspection of the data is consistent with this result because the regions these systems occupy interferes with the region defined by systems containing black holes : for instance , consider figure 5 comparing a burster system that is misclassified as a black hole system to a burster system that is not misclassified , where there appears to be significantly more overlap with the black hole system training data for the misclassified system .",
    "it is also possible that some of these systems are misclassified as non - pulsing neutron star systems in the literature , yet significantly more scientific investigation must be performed in order to verify this possibility . finally in table 3 , we include predictions and probability estimates for unclassified or ambiguously classified xrb systems , for which notably gx 3 + 1 has a reasonably high estimated probability for being a non - pulsing neutron star system : .7674 with a standard error .0326 .",
    "it is important to note that the entire distribution of posterior predictive draws provide significantly more spatial information than a point estimate for compact system type .",
    "for instance consider the systems ser x-1 and aql x-1 , the first of which is a properly classified non - pulsing system , and the second which is one that is improperly classified as a black hole . from figure 6",
    "there seems to be no question that ser x-1 is indeed a non - pulsing neutron star system since the proportion of posterior predictive draws is .9341 with a standard error of .0133 . on the other hand",
    "while aql x-1 is not properly classified as is evident in figure 7 we do see some signal for non - pulsar evidenced by the .3093 estimated probability of being a non - pulsing system , with standard error 0.0507 .",
    "the main objective of this work has been to develop a probabilistic model for predicting the compact object type of cci observations from an xrb and to use the predictions generated from this model to estimate the probabilities that the compact object type is a black hole , non - pulsing neutron star , or pulsar .",
    "we have shown that the model we have developed works reasonably well for this purpose based on the accurate classification of well known x - ray binaries , but note that the model seems to make mistakes for the classification of bursters that are close to the boundary between black hole systems and non - pulsars in the cci coordinate system .",
    "this suggests further investigation of these systems as well as refinement of our approach , including the sampling of data , models , and algorithms used .",
    "it is also possible that some of these  burster \" systems are inappropriately classified , but more scientific investigation must be made before such a claim can be vigorously asserted .    in order to improve the predictive accuracy of our classification scheme",
    ", we can extend the imputation model by imposing a distribution on the gaussian process parameters or else using a cross validation approach to fine tune these parameters .",
    "there is a growing literature on gaussian process prediction that attempts to bypass the associated computational impediments and so we would like to investigate these methods and their potential application to this problem further , e.g. the inla method introduced by @xcite .",
    "additionally , the rxte asm data contains a large fraction of missing data due to the signal to noise threshold we employ and so we may consider applying the framework of @xcite to model this missing data .",
    "the primary advantages of this approach are that it utilizes a bayesian model for generating imputations , which is consistent with our model for compact object prediction , and it may lead to more plausible predictions for the unknown compact object types . additionally , we may want to consider different subsampling schemes besides the one we employ to ensure that they do not corrupt the inherent structure in the data set . finally , in addition to predictive accuracy , to make the model more scientifically relevant we may want to include physically meaningful parameters ; the inference of such parameters may explain the scientific reasons for the separation of observations into different regions by compact object type .",
    "the cci method by definition uses measurements of x - ray intensity and color in two x - ray bands .",
    "this information will in general not only reflect on the properties of the source but also on the absorption of the intrinsic spectrum by the interstellar medium .",
    "ism absorption will clearly affect the lowest energy band the most , and thus the soft color .",
    "however , at higher column densities , the hard color will be affected as well .",
    "we are developing a general method for correction of cci plots given the sensitivity curve of an x - ray monitoring telescope and likely models of the spectral shape ( boroson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the erosita telescope developed at the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics and due to be launched in 2016 has 20 times the sensitivity of the rosat / asm in the low energy band and will be particularly beneficial to study the ism .",
    "@xcite    we can extend our long - range study using data from past and present large field of view x - ray instruments such as maxi @xcite , the hete - wxm @xcite and beppsax - wfc @xcite .",
    "current and planned x - ray telescopes with high sensitivity such as chandra @xcite , xmm @xcite , and erosita @xcite will enable us to apply our methodology to xrbs of much lower luminosity .",
    "finally , we reiterate that the ` r ` code we have written to make predictions for this analysis ought to be be applicable to other cci data sets quite easily , and so have provided it for public use .",
    "the harvard ichasc is acknowledged for their helpful feedback .",
    "additionally , gg and sdv would like to acknowledge partial support through a smithsonian institution cgps grant to sdv .    _",
    "facilities : _ .",
    "as expounded upon by @xcite in detail , prediction in the bayesian paradigm essentially follows the following iterative scheme : first draw from the posterior distribution of model parameters and latent variables through a monte carlo simulation , and then draw from the predictive distribution of interest , which in our case is that of @xmath8 , conditional on these draws . adapting this general strategy for our problem ,",
    "equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) from section 3 suggest the following iterative algorithm for sampling from the posterior predictive distribution for the compact object type .    * sample from the posterior distribution @xmath33 using elliptical slice sampling due to the joint multivariate normal distribution of @xmath34 .",
    "the method of elliptical slice sampling was introduced by @xcite . *",
    "sample the posterior latent variables at the prediction points , @xmath35 , using the conditional multivariate normal distribution of @xmath36 , which has mean @xmath37 and covariance matrix @xmath38 due to fundamental properties of conditional mvn distributions .",
    "is the submatrix consisting of the rows @xmath14 to @xmath39 and columns @xmath40 to @xmath4 of @xmath9 .",
    "the other submatrices of @xmath9 used in the previous formula are analogously defined . ] * sample from @xmath8 from a multinomial distribution conditional on the posterior latent draw of @xmath41 , where as aforementioned the probability for @xmath42 to be of type @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "elliptical slice sampling is a monte carlo algorithm developed to simulate from a posterior probability distribution where the prior distribution is jointly multivariate normal , a condition that holds in our model as discussed in section 3 . as explained by @xcite , this is a scenario where traditional monte carlo methods applied within a bayesian context , such as gibbs sampling or metropolis - hastings , perform poorly .",
    "routines to implement elliptical slice sampling and draw from the posterior distribution of @xmath35 and @xmath8 were written in the r programming language using the rcpp , rcppeigen and rcpparmadillo packages for the efficient inline implementations of linear algebraic routines in c++ @xcite .",
    "additional packages used in the testing and development of this code were mvtnorm and mass @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the computational impediments of elliptical slice sampling stem primarily from determining the cholesky decomposition of and inverting a multivariate normal covariance matrix .",
    "rcppeigen and rcpparmadillo provide efficient implementations for determining the cholesky decomposition and performing matrix inversion that can be conveniently included directly within r code .",

    "<S> we develop a bayesian statistical model which makes use of the fact that x - ray binary systems appear to cluster based on their compact object type when viewed from a 3-dimensional coordinate system derived from x - ray spectral data , where the first coordinate is the ratio of counts in mid to low energy band ( color 1 ) , the second coordinate is the ratio of counts in high to low energy band ( color 2 ) , and the third coordinate is the sum of counts in all three bands . </S>",
    "<S> precisely , we use this model to estimate the probabilities that an x - ray binary system contains a black hole , non - pulsing neutron star or pulsing neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we utilize a latent variable model in which the latent variables follow a gaussian process prior distribution , and hence we are able to induce the spatial correlation we believe exists between systems of the same type . </S>",
    "<S> the utility of this approach is evidenced by the accurate prediction of system types using rossi x - ray timing explorer all sky monitor data , but it is not flawless . in particular , non - pulsing neutron systems containing  bursters \" which are close to the boundary demarcating systems containing black holes tend to be classified as black hole systems . as a byproduct of our analyses , </S>",
    "<S> we provide the astronomer with public ` r ` code that can be used to predict the compact object type of x - ray binaries given training data . </S>"
