    "the capture of a projectile particle by a nucleus followed by the emission of a photon is called radiative capture .",

    "however , one should take into account various factors arising from dealing with photons in a two body problem .",
    "one of them is the fact that photons are massless bosons , and hence , obey planckian statistics .",
    "historically , photodisintegration reactions have been treated with maxwell - boltzmann statistics , both because it is usually an excellent approximation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and because this assumption simplifies the determination of the photodisintegration rates",
    ". however , low - energy photons are more correctly represented by a planck distribution . as discussed below",

    "then the effects of quantum statistics become more relevant .",
    "we show here that modified thermal photodisintegration rates can be written in the form of a small analytic correction to the tabulated reaction rates obtained with maxwell - boltzmann statistics . furthermore , these correction factors are nearly independent of the nuclear cross sections and to leading order only depend upon the reaction @xmath5-value , the gamow energy ( for the charged - particle nonresonant part ) , and the resonance energy ( for the resonant part ) .      for a reaction ( not necessarily in equilibrium ) of the form",

    "the massive interacting particles are non - degenerate ( i.e. , dilute ) and non - relativistic ( i.e. , their rest mass energy is large compared to @xmath15 ) .",
    "hence , one can use a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution with newtonian kinetic energy because @xmath16 where the exponential factor involving the rest mass energy drops out with a proper normalization of the distribution function . also note that when both particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 obey maxwell - boltzmann statistics , so does their relative velocity @xcite .",

    "this eliminates any dependence of the reaction rate on the velocity distribution of the target nuclei @xcite .",

    "it is of note that the conditions of nse are also modified from the usual saha equation by the above quantum corrections .",
    "moreover , in conditions of nse , one sometimes synthesizes nuclei for which @xmath0 and the corrections can become larger .",

    "for example , the altered statistics will affect the timescale for the build up of abundances .",
    "another possible application of the corrections deduced here is for the ionization equilibrium of atomic or molecular species with a low ionization potential in stellar atmospheres .",
    "however , we will not consider that case further here .",
    "it is worth noting that quantum effects always tend to speed up photodisintegration rates because the planck distribution places many more photons at low energy than a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the same temperature or energy density . in other words",

    "( [ eq : thermal ] ) is that it gives the quantum correction as a small _ fraction _ of the classical maxwellian result .",
    "hence , for implementation in large networks , an analytic approximation to the exact numerical integration for @xmath36 is both adequate and desirable .",

    "it is responsible for the production of about half of the observed abundances of elements heavier than iron .",
    "although many sites have been proposed for the @xmath1-process , the neutrino energized wind above the proto - neutron star in core - collapse supernovae remains a favorite @xcite .",
    "whatever the environment , however , it can be shown that the solar - system @xmath1-process abundances are well reproduced by beta - decay flow in a system that is in approximate @xmath168 equilibrium .",
    "hence , the relative abundances of isotopes of a given element are determined by the revised nuclear saha equation ( [ sahaeq ] ) @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the neutron - capture @xmath5-value for isotope @xmath171 ( or equivalently the neutron separation energy for the nucleus @xmath172 ) and @xmath173 represents the abundance of an isotope @xmath171 .",
    "this equation defines a sharp peak in abundances for one ( or a few ) isotopes within an isotopic chain .",
    "the flow of beta decays along these peak isotopes is then known as the @xmath1-process path .",

    ", the system falls out of nse and the @xmath1-process path decays back to the line of stable isotopes .    from eq .",
    "( [ path ] ) we deduce that @xmath0 along the path requires a neutron density of @xmath186 @xmath183 .",
    "although such conditions do not occur at freezeout , they may occur earlier in the @xmath1-process .",
    "for example , in the neutrino driven wind models of @xcite , the @xmath1-process conditions begin with the neutron density at @xmath187 @xmath183 and a temperature of @xmath188 .",
    "the density is also much higher ( @xmath189 @xmath183 ) when the material is first ejected from the proto - neutron star .",
    "such conditions may also be achieved for an @xmath1-process which occurs during neutron - star mergers @xcite .",
    "as the correction factors become larger , the effect on the @xmath1-process may be to slightly increase the time it takes for the @xmath1-process to build up substantial abundances of the heaviest nuclei .",

    "the @xmath2-process @xcite refers to a sequence of rapid proton and alpha captures in explosive hot hydrogen - burning environments .",
    "the most energetic such environments occur on accreting neutron stars and are believed to be the source of observed type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "energetic events are also thought to occur during accretion onto the magnetic polar caps of x - ray pulsars . in such environments",
    "rapid proton captures and beta decays occur among proton - rich isotopes until further proton capture is inhibited because such capture would lead to an unbound nucleus . at this point ,",

    "just as in the @xmath1-process , this equation defines a peak in abundances along an isotonic chain . in this process , proton - capture rates along the @xmath2-process tend to be dominated by resonances in the captured nuclei .",
    "as noted above , the quantum corrections will be largest for nuclei with low proton binding energies and also low lying resonances .",
    "recently , the reactions which most significantly affect the @xmath2-process models have been reviewed @xcite .",

    "for typical @xmath2-process conditions ( @xmath223 ) the correction factors are @xmath224% .",
    "the effect of including these corrections will be to increase the photodissociation rates and therefore to shift the path slightly closer to stability .",
    "this could slightly modify the time - scale and energy release in x - ray burst models .",
    "once the core ( or shell - burning ) temperature in a massive star exceeds a temperature @xmath225 , photonuclear reactions begin to dissociate nuclei into free protons , neutrons , and alpha particles plus heavy nuclei .",
    "this leads to photonuclear rearrangement as the free nucleons and alpha particles are captured on the remaining nuclei , eventually leading to the build up of an iron core .",
    "this process begins with core oxygen burning ( @xmath226 ) and culminates with core or explosive quasi - equilibrium silicon burning which occurs at temperatures of up to @xmath227 .",
    "this process can be described by the nse equation . for the most part ,",
    "however , this process involves photonuclear rearrangement of nuclei near the line of beta stability with rather large nucleon and alpha separation energies , @xmath228 mev .",
    "hence , even up to @xmath227 , the major products of these advanced burning stages involve @xmath229 and the correction factors can be neglected .",

    "even for these nuclei , however , the maximum correction is @xmath240% .",
    "hence , for the most part these corrections can be neglected during core and explosive thermonuclear burning in massive stars .",
    "perhaps , what may seem as the most obvious application of the deduced corrections would be to the @xmath3-process @xcite .",
    "the nucleosynthetic origin of the isotopes that lie on the proton - rich side of stability likely requires @xcite the onset of photonuclear reactions with @xmath241 . in this scenario ,",
    "the nucleosynthesis of proton - rich nuclei is achieved by photo - disintegration reactions on pre - existing @xmath242- or @xmath1-process nuclei .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of all relevant nuclei in this process , however , involves a path on the proton - rich side of stability for which the proton binding energies are of order @xmath243 mev , implying @xmath244 .",
    "hence , the correction factors deduced here have little effect on the production of proton - rich nuclei in the @xmath3-process and can be neglected",
    ".      for the most part , standard big bang nucleosynthesis is also unaffected by the corrections derived here . to examine this",
    "we have calculated big bang abundances with and without the correction for quantum statistics .",
    "the temperature evolution of the light element abundances is summarized in figure [ fig : bbn ] . to generate this plot",
    ", we used the network code in @xcite and @xcite with reaction rates from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the adopted neutron life time is @xmath245 s @xcite and the baryon to photon ratio is fixed to @xmath246 based upon the wmap seven year data for the @xmath247cdm+sz+lens model @xcite .",
    "because the light - element reactions involve relatively high @xmath5-values and most of the nucleosynthesis involves relatively low temperatures @xmath135 , there is almost no effect on the final calculated abundances . even at the epoch during which the weak reactions decouple ( @xmath248 ) , the slightly modified nse abundances ( see insert on graph ) would have a negligible effect on the details of neutrino last scattering .",
    "hence , one is justified in ignoring these corrections for standard big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is possible , however , that some scenarios of inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis could involve proton - rich or neutron - rich nuclei with low @xmath5-values @xcite .",
    "since photons are massless , they are sensitive to the effects of quantum statistics . as a result , at high temperature some of the reverse reaction rates with low @xmath5-values can be modified from the tabulated values based upon the approximation of classical maxwell - boltzmann statistics for the photons . moreover , in any environment the quantum effects always speed up the photodisintegration rate because a planck distribution places more photons at low energies than a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the same temperature . as a result ,",
    "those nuclei with loosely bound nucleons lose them faster than predicted by the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution . in this paper",
    ", we have derived analytic correction terms for the effects of the quantum statistical distribution of photons on tabulated thermonuclear photodisintegration rates . usually , this modification is small because @xmath249 so that there is little difference between a planck and a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",

    "these corrections have little effect except , perhaps in the case of the @xmath2-process for those reactions near the proton drip line waiting points , or in the early stages of the @xmath1-process when the neutron density is high enough to drive the @xmath1-process path to nuclei with low @xmath5-values even at high temperature .",
