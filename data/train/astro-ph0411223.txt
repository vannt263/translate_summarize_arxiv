    "the total number of models pretending to explain the origin of the knee exceeds twenty and the number of people who propose these models is about thirty .",
    "the number of ideas is definitely larger , but i deliberately distinguish _ ideas _ and _ models _ , because sometimes the ideas are not developed at all to be considered as a model .",
    "the quality of the development is also quite different for different models . to the great extent",
    "it is due to the lack of astrophysical or particle physics data which could constrain the models , but there are also some evident subjective reasons . certainly it is our duty to examine as much consequences of the proposed idea as we can and to some extent it is our fault that we ignore some evident experimental or observational facts which contradict the proposed idea .",
    "there is a tradition in our p.n.lebedev physical institute that if you propose the idea you should also propose the test which can * kill * your idea .",
    "we must admit that there is not a lot of authors who propose such tests .",
    "in this talk i examine some features which should be explained by models of the knee and requirements which should be satisfied .",
    "usually we consider just three main characteristics of cosmic rays ( cr ) which should be predicted by the model and checked by the comparison with experimental data - they are _ the energy spectrum , the mass composition and the anisotropy_. among them there might be some phenomenological sub - features , which are sometimes crucially important .",
    "quite a good survey of models with their regard to the observed features of the energy spectrum and the mass composition is given in @xcite . here",
    "i focus only on the problems related to the cr energy spectrum .",
    "usually we examine such features of the spectrum as the absolute intensity and slopes below and above the knee .",
    "i should like to draw the attention to some other sub - features of the spectrum shape viz .",
    "its negligible _ irregularity _ , then _ the sharpness and the fine structure _ of the knee .      since the discovery of extensive air showers ( eas ) it has been found that their size spectrum has the power law character in wide energy ranges below and above the knee .",
    "the theory of shock acceleration explained this power law and since then the educated guess was that it is supernova explosions which create the shocks , which in turn accelerate particles and produce a regular power law of the cr energy spectrum .",
    "however , we should remark that a stochastic character of supernova explosions in space and time prevents the formation of the regular spectrum .",
    "the subsequent propagation of cr in the interstellar medium ( ism ) only emphasizes the irregularity since it results in the dominant contribution of nearby and recent supernova remnants ( snr ) to cr observed at earth .",
    "the accurate monte - carlo realization of the scenario , where only galactic snr give birth to observed cr , shows the extremely irregular character of the spectrum with the very low probability to observe the good power law ( figure 1a ) .",
    "we consider the irregularity as a very important phenomenological feature and propose as the measure of the irregularity the parameter @xmath0 , which is the standard deviation from the mean intensity taken in a logarithmic scale . as an example",
    ", figure 1b shows the irregularity as the function of primary energy for the scenario of standard supernova exploding sporadically in our galaxy and producing different spectra , shown in figure 1a .",
    "it is seen that due to the decreasing lifetime of higher energy cr in the galaxy the smaller number of recent snr contributes to the intensity and the irregularity of the spectra increases .",
    "the remarkable sharpness of the knee has been mentioned even in the first publication by kulikov and khristiansen in 1958 @xcite .",
    "they have written : _ the presented data indicate with a great probability the possible * sharp * change of the spectrum in the studied range of shower sizes @xmath1_. in @xcite we suggested to use as the measure of sharpness the parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the shower intensity and @xmath4 is the eas size .",
    "the advantage of this second derivative is that it depends _ neither _ on the absolute intensity _ nor _ on the slopes of the spectrum below and above the knee .",
    "the world survey of 40 spectra @xcite showed that inspite of the big spread of sharpness values nearly all of them exceed the value 0.3 expected for the original galactic modulation model ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this important phenomenological characteristic should be taken into account in every reasonable model of the knee and never ignored .",
    "fluctuations in the eas development smear out the irregularity of the primary cr energy spectrum , but not down the regular power law with @xmath5 . due to the stochastic nature of the cr sources there",
    "* must * be structure_at some level_. the well known examples of such structures are the widely discussed _ knee _ and _",
    "the ankle_. the search for other structures is difficult since the deviations from the power law are evdently small .",
    "one must have a good statistics to find the structure in the single experiment .",
    "to use the data accumulated in many experiments one has to eliminate their difference in the background and calibration .",
    "we satisfied the first requirement using _ the deviation from the running mean_. to satisfy the second requirement we referred the position of the deviation to the position of the knee in each individual experiment .",
    "the position of the knee has been determined as the point of the maximum sharpness in the spectrum .",
    "this approach is absolutely legitimate if you study the shape of the spectrum .",
    "we processed 40 eas size spectra and 5 cherenkov light spectra available at that time and the result is shown in figure 3 .",
    "besides the apparent excess at the knee there is a second excess ( peak ) at @xmath6 seen both in the cherenkov light and in the eas electron size spectrum .",
    "we consider this result as the strong evidence for the fine structure of the knee , which should be taken into account by any reasonable model of the knee .",
    "the origin of this peak will be discussed later .",
    "however it is clear that such structure is nearly impossible to get in the classic galactic modulation model with its smooth leakage of cr from the galaxy .",
    "all models of the knee can be tentatively divided into three groups : _ astrophysical _ models , _ interaction _ models and _ phenomenological _ models .",
    "the astrophysical models in turn can be subdivided into _ source _ models and _ propagation _ models .",
    "the models of the first group explain the origin of the knee by astrophysical reasons : either by the change or the evolution of cr sources , or by the change of the propagation and the leakage from the galaxy .",
    "the interaction models claim that there is no sharp change of the primary cr energy spectrum .",
    "they refer the steepening of the observed eas size spectrum and the change of their characteristics to the change of the particle interactions at pev energies .",
    "the phenomenological models do nt specify new sources or new processes above the knee , but try to explain the steepening by the existing features of the primary cr or an eas development .",
    "sometimes the association of the model with any group is ambiguous , and this classification is given just for the orientation .",
    "below i ll give some examples of the models , which were discussed in recent years .",
    "certainly the list of these examples is not complete and i ask those authors who will not be mentioned to apologize me for my ignorance .",
    "the most developed conception is that sources of cr below the knee are supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "the shock waves produced by the explosions can accelerate protons up to maximum energies @xmath7 0.1 - 0.4 pev .",
    "the knee is due to the impossibility for sn to accelerate particles up to higher energies .",
    "this cut - off at @xmath8 is rather sharp and by this way one can explain the visible sharpness of the knee .",
    "however the immediate questions to these models are : + ( i ) are sn standard enough to give about the same @xmath8 to give the sharp knee ? + ( ii ) what is the origin of cr above the knee ?",
    "different source models give different answers to these questions .",
    "i should like to speak about our single source model later and here just mention the model of p.l.biermann @xcite .",
    "he allows that there might be just a few ordinary sn remnants ( snr ) which give dominant contribution at the knee and ensure the formation of the sharp knee .",
    "he even assumes that their explosions due to special conditions created during the collapse can be standard @xcite .",
    "the cosmic rays above the knee are produced by another type of sn , which progenitors are more massive , hot and emit powerful particle wind before the explosion .",
    "the typical representative of such type of sources are well known wolf - raye stars .",
    "the powerful shock wave propagating through the bubble created by the hot wind accelerates particle up to eev energies .",
    "similar idea is developed by l.g.sveshnikova @xcite , who examined the variety of sn types and concluded that the dominant contribution to cr below the knee is given by just sni@xmath9 type and above the knee - by explosions of more massive and hot stars which she called _ ` hypernovae ' _ though this name is often associated with sn explosions accompanied by gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "the interesting model of the cosmic ray acceleration by blobs of relativistic plasma is proposed by a.dar , r.plaga and a.de rujula @xcite .",
    "its main subject is the origin of gamma ray bursts , but there are important points in this scenario which have relevance to our discussion .",
    "the sources of cosmic rays in this model are cannonballs - relativistic plasmoids which are emitted by the core collapsed supernovae and stopped in the galactic halo or in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . by this way",
    "authors avoid difficulties connected with the need to introduce different sources below and above the knee - the sources are the same and the knee is connected with the increasing number of reflections from the cannonball , needed to accelerate particles to higher energies . since the model of the knee is not sufficiently developed it is difficult to say whether it explains the sharpness of the knee or not . as for the irregularity the problem seems not to be severe since cr sources can be even more numerous than snr since each of them can emit a few cannonballs .",
    "there is no problem with the isotropy and the absence or presence of the gzk cutoff , since the sources are mainly distributed in the galactic halo @xcite or in the igm @xcite , but not in the galactic disk .",
    "there are other models which claim that there is no need to introduce another kind of sources beyond the knee .",
    "snr are able to accelerate particles up to hundreds pev due to compression and magnification of magnetic fields inside the shell @xcite",
    ". however these strong fields decrease with time as soon as the snr expands .",
    "snr turned out to accelerate particles to higher energies during the shorter time at the very beginning of their history .",
    "it gives rise to the steepening of the energy spectrum and imitating the knee @xcite .",
    "there are so called compact source models which are the combination of the source and interaction models .",
    "they examine the possibility for protons emitted by the source to lose the energy in photopion reactions and for nuclei - to disintegrate after the interaction with intense radiation fields around these compact sources @xcite .",
    "though the knee formed by these process is sharper than in the propagation models considered below ( s @xmath10 0.35 instead of 0.3 ) it is not sufficient to explain the observations .",
    "moreover these models predict the extremely light mass composition beyond the knee , which contradicts the observations .",
    "i think all the mentioned source models have problems when compared with the shower phenomenology .",
    "models which require different sources below and above the knee usually propose more energetic and less abundant sources of higher energy cr above the knee .",
    "they inevitably meet problems with the irregularity .",
    "the small number of high energy sources or shorter time of the acceleration to higher energies increase the sensitivity of the cosmic ray energy spectrum to the particular space - time distribution of the sources and reduce the possibility to form the regular power - law spectrum .",
    "source models need the additional mechanism ( halo or igm ) which could smooth the irregularity of the cr spectrum below and above the knee . on the other hand",
    "the models with snr accelerating particles up to sub - eev and eev energies give just the smooth steepening of the cr energy spectrum and are not able to explain the sharpness of the knee .",
    "propagation models were the first suggested after the discovery of the knee @xcite .",
    "they associate the steeper spectrum above the knee with the increased leakage of cr particles from the galaxy when their gyroradius becomes comparable with the transverse size of the galactic disk .",
    "latest developments of this idea included models with introduction of the hall diffusion @xcite and an anomalous diffusion in the ism of quasi - fractal type @xcite .",
    "all they have problems with the sharpness of the observed spectrum .",
    "original models had the sharpness of the constituent spectra not greater than 0.6 . for the mixed mass composition with the abundance of constituent nuclei equal to their abundance at tev energies the model sharpness decreased down to 0.3 . in more sophisticated models with the hall diffusion and a special geometry of regular magnetic field in the galactic disk and halo",
    "the authors @xcite created the small intensity bump in the knee region and by this way increased the sharpness of constituent spectra up to 1.0 .",
    "the composite spectrum with a mixed composition will also have a greater sharpness but no more than 0.7 .",
    "it is much less than the required value of about 3 .",
    "the second problem is the observed fine structure of the spectrum .",
    "if the propagation models predict the smooth constituent spectra with a continuous steepening , it is impossible to construct a total spectrum with discontinuities which are seen as the fine structure .",
    "the interaction models introduce new processes in the interaction of cr particles at pev energies to justify the sharp steepening of the eas size spectrum .",
    "some of these models require the new physics either to create new heavy particles with large cross - sections , which decay into yet unobservable high energy muons and neutrinos @xcite , some required emission of technihadrons , gravitons @xcite or very many low energy particles @xcite .",
    "the model with an enhanced production of charmed particles @xcite slows down the development of the atmospheric cascade so that the bulk of its energy is dissipated not in the atmosphere but reaches the mountain or even the sea level and is absorbed in the earth .",
    "the experimental confirmation of neutrino oscillations and therefore an existence of the neutrino mass inspired the creation of the models where cosmic ray particles interact with relic neutrinos in the gravitationally attracted neutrino halos surrounding galaxies and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "by assuming the neutrino mass in the region of ev it is easy to obtain the energy threshold for the inelastic @xmath11p interaction in the pev region .    in my mind",
    "the drawback of these models is not only that most of them require the new physics in the energy region very close to that already studied in fermilab , but that they often do nt specify the new process and do nt develop their interaction model to incorporate and test it with well developed simulation codes such as corsika , like it has been done for more conservative models ( qgsjet , sybill etc . ) .",
    "these models can explain the existence of the knee , sometimes even its sharpness by introducing a rapid rise of the cross - section above the threshold , but never other phenomenology of eas accumulated hitherto . in this respect",
    "i should better attribute nearly all of them to ideas and not to models .",
    "phenomenological models of the knee just extrapolate the observed phenomenological characteristics of cr or eas into the high energy region and demonstrate that with certain approximations they give the steepening of the energy spectrum which they associate with the knee .    to such type of models",
    "i attribute the model of tsallis et al @xcite .",
    "they applied the formulae of generalized non - extensive statistics to the observed cr energy spectrum and have found that it is possible to fit its behaviour with the bend at sub - gev and the steepening at pev energies in the total range of 34 decades of the differential intensity .",
    "the knee in this model appears as a crossover between two fractal thermal regimes .    to the phenomenological class of models",
    "belongs also the multi - component model of biermann and ter - antonyan @xcite .",
    "they obtain parameters of the constituent nuclei spectra by multivariate fitting of the electron and muon size spectra measured by kascade and maket ani experiments .",
    "another phenomenological model is proposed by stenkin @xcite , who connects the steepening of the eas size spectrum with the non - linearity of the @xmath12 dependence which in turn is connected with the change of the eas structure as soon as the shower maximum approaches the observation level . if @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the decreasing function of @xmath15 then even for the power law primary energy spectrum @xmath16 with a constant @xmath17 the slope index @xmath18 of the eas size spectrum @xmath19 increases with @xmath20 and the spectrum steepens imitating the knee even for the constant slope of the primary spectrum .",
    "i would attribute to phenomenological models also the so - called _ poly - gonato model _ of j.r.hrandel @xcite .",
    "he noticed that spectra of constituent nuclei in primary cr become flatter with an increasing primary mass .",
    "he extrapolates these spectra up to their rigidity cutoff and found that it is possible to describe not only the knee but the general behaviour of the primary energy spectrum up to sub - eev energies . at these high energies",
    "the substantial fraction of cosmic rays can be trans - iron elements .",
    "since these models are purely phenomenological and not pretend to explain the origin of cosmic rays they have no problems with the spectrum irregularities .",
    "however they may have problems with the observed fine structure of the spectrum and definitely with the sharpness of the spectrum if they will not assume the sharp cutoff of the constituent spectra .",
    "it would be unfair if i ll tell nothing about the present status of the single source model ( ssm ) .",
    "me and prof.a.w.wolfendale proposed it in 1997 @xcite and updated in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the main idea was that the knee is due to the contribution of just one single , recent and nearby snr .",
    "since it is nearby and recent , cr from this snr have a flat energy spectrum with a sharp cutoff @xcite . at pev energies",
    "their intensity becomes comparable with the total cr background from all other distant and old snr and their contribution creates the bump which forms the knee . due to the sharp cutoff of the spectrum beyong its maximum rigidity @xmath21",
    "the knee is sharp and different constituent nuclei which have different maximum energy @xmath22 give rise to the fine structure of the spectrum .",
    "actually the energy spectrum of cr created by the single source is the result of the fit of theoretical spectra @xcite to the existing experimental data from 40 independent eas electron size spectra , 9 muon size spectra , 3 hadron size and energy spectra and 5 cherenkov light spectra . comparing this spectrum with the spectrum of cr expected from snr of different ages and placed at different distances from the earth we estimated the most likely intervals of distances and ages of the single source @xcite .",
    "they appeared to be rather narrow around 300 pc and 100 kyear . soon after that american astronomers using the triangulation technique have found that the pulsar b0656 + 14 associated with the snr monogem ring is situated exactly at the indicated range of distances and ages as required for our single source @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we presented arguments why the nearby snr is not seen in gamma rays .",
    "it is because being nearby it is situated in our local superbubble with its low density of ism which is about @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "moreover it is not a discrete , but an extended source with the angular radius of 20@xmath25 and the problem of the correct subtraction of the background from such a big area is not trivial .",
    "many experiments have already looked for an excessive intensity of cr from this region and found nothing @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the situation is controversial , since recently the moscow university @xcite and tien - shan @xcite groups revealed weak eas excesses in the monogem ring area .",
    "if there are indeed cr excesses at sub - pev and pev energies from the monogem ring region they can evidence for the activity of the pulsar b0656 + 14 which emitted high energy cr soon after its birth and which were confined within the snr for a long time of about 80 kyear @xcite .",
    "high energy gamma - quanta which create these excesses are produced by cr on the local fluctuations of the interstellar gas density .",
    "the energy spectum of cr produced by the pulsar b0656 + 14 has the sharp peak at the rigidity of 0.25 pv which is very close to the @xmath26 pv , required by the sn model of berezhko et al @xcite and can contribute to the observed knee sharpness , but its contribution to the cr intensity at the knee does not exceed 15% .",
    "however , this pulsar can be responsible for cr beyond the knee at energies above 10 pev .",
    "recently we analysed the region beyond the knee and have found an extended excess of eas intensity in the broad region slightly above @xmath27 gev @xcite ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the existence of this excess gives an argument in favor of the assumption that the pulsar b0656 + 14 contributes to the cr intensity above @xmath28 gev . so that there is an impression that the snr monogem ring with its associated pulsar b0656 + 14 can be a serious contender for the single source responsible for the pev cr intensity bump and the knee itself .",
    "it is not easy to kill the ssm , since its parameters were taken to fit the existing phenomenology .",
    "it is possible , however , to check and to kill the initial mass composition predicted by ssm .",
    "originally we attributed intensity peaks at 3 and  12 pev to @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "if we are right then we can not expect another peaks beyond 12 pev .",
    "however if the observed peaks are actually due to @xmath31 and @xmath29 , then we can expect the existence of the sharp @xmath30 peak at 40 pev .",
    "so far there is no indication of this peak in the experimental data from kascade .",
    "we look forward at the new data from kascade - grande .",
    "in the summary i stress again that the models which pretend to explain the origin of the knee should explain not only the high isotropy , the tendency of the primary mass composition to become heavier above the knee , but also such phenomenological features as the _ sharpness _ , the _ fine structure _ of the knee and the relatively _ small irregularity _ of the energy spectrum both _ far below _ and _ far above _ the knee . at the moment none of the models",
    "can satisfy these requirements .",
    "source models which require less abundant and more energetic sources have problems with the large irregularity of the spectrum in particular above the knee .",
    "the same difficulty have the models with relatively abundant sources like pulsars which emit high energy cr for a short time after their creation .",
    "definitely we have to incorporate the object or the mechanism which level out irregularities originated from the stochastic space - time distributions of sources .",
    "the first candidates for such an object could be the galactic halo or igm .",
    "all propagation models have not the sufficient sharpness of the knee even for the constituent spectra . as the consequence",
    "they should have problems with the observed fine structure of the spectrum .",
    "they take for granted the regular power law spectra with no explanation of the origin of this regularity , therefore they can also have hidden problems with the irregularity of the spectrum .",
    "the phenomenological models do nt pretend to explain the origin of cr and the knee - they use different input spectra and find the best fit to the observed phenomenology of the showers .",
    "the sharpness , the fine structure depend on the shape of these input spectra so that there is no actual explanation of the observed phenomenology .    the interaction models , besides that they require the new physics , are not sufficiently developed to be tested by the phenomenology .",
    "it is clear that modifying the threshold behaviour of the new process it is possible to fit both the sharpness and the fine structure of the spectrum , but the value of this exercise is not very high . since the main subject of interaction models is the knee they do not explain the small irregularity of the cr spectrum outside the knee region .",
    "this table shows that the _ astrophysical _ models are the most developed and some of them can match the observed phenomenology . among astrophysical models _ source _ models are the most plausible . for nearly all models we need to introduce a mechanism which could smear out the irregularity of the energy spectrum due to the stochastic nature of the sources , viz .",
    "galactic halo , intergalactic medium or so .",

    "<S> it is evident that models of the knee should match the observational phenomenology . in this talk </S>",
    "<S> i discuss a few aspects of phenomenology , which are important not only for the understanding of the knee origin , but also for the general problem of the origin of cosmic rays . among them </S>",
    "<S> are the shape of the energy spectrum , its irregularity , the sharpness of the knee and its fine structure . </S>",
    "<S> the classification of models is given and some examples of the most recent models are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the most probable conclusion deduced from this examination is that the knee has an astrophysical origin and the so called source models of the knee are most likely among them . </S>"
