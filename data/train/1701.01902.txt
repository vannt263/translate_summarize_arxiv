    "[ def : pcm ] a newton map @xmath10 is called postcritically minimal ( pcm ) if components of the fatou set are only of two types : superattracting basins and parabolic basins of @xmath8 , and the followings hold :    a.   julia critical orbits and critical orbits in superattracting basins are finite .",
    "b.   critical points in a basin of @xmath8 are in _ minimal _ critical orbit relations such that : a.   in every immediate basin of @xmath8 there exists a single ( possibly with higher multiplicity ) critical point ; b.   all other critical points ( if there is any ) in a basin of @xmath8 will land in _ minimal iterate _ to a critical point in one of immediate basins of @xmath8 forming a single grant orbit .",

    "moreover in the basin of @xmath14 there exists only a single minimal grant orbit of critical points meaning that the orbit passes through a fatou component at most once , except immediate basins .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are critical points such that the orbit of @xmath19 passes through the component of fatou set containing the point @xmath20 then the first passing point should be @xmath20 .",
    "recall that a rational function is called postcritically finite ( pcf ) if its critical orbits are finite ; every critical point in the fatou set ( fatou critical point ) eventually terminates at a superattracting periodic point , and every critical point in the julia set ( julia critical point ) eventually terminates at a repelling periodic point .",
    "moreover , in case when a superattracting fixed point ( which is also a critical point ) captures some other critical point then their critical orbit relation is minimal in the sense that the latter lands to the former without wondering within the immediate basin .",
    "otherwise , its orbit is infinite and never lands to the superattracting fixed point since the dynamics is conjugate to a power map , @xmath21 . the same landing behavior is required for critical points of pcm newton maps .",
    "relaxing a postcritically finiteness condition comes with some cost ; post - critical minimality is much weaker than postcritically finiteness . to illustrate how large the family of newton maps of degree @xmath22 we are dealing with is ,",

    "i.e. @xmath4 is a constant function ) , parabolic surgery procedure results to a new rational function , which turns out to be a newton map of entire function .",
    "this operation defines a map from the space of newton maps of polynomials to the space of rational newton maps of entire functions .    for every pair of @xmath22 and @xmath25 ,",
    "we show that parabolic surgery induces a natural bijection between the space of surgery equivalence classes of marked postcritically finite newton maps of polynomials , of degree @xmath22 , and the space of affine conjugacy classes of postcritically minimal newton maps of entire functions , of degree @xmath26 , which are of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "surjectivity is given in theorem  [ thm : surjectivity_haissinsky ] , which states that every pcm newton map is obtained by a pcf newton map of polynomial and a parabolic surgery .",
    "for this , we use g. cui s result on parabolic to hyperbolic surgery to perturb a newton map of entire function and obtain some newton map of polynomial with a marking .",
    "we then apply parabolic surgery to the latter and obtain a new newton map of entire function .",
    "finally we show that the newton map of entire function that we started with and the latter are affine conjugate .",
