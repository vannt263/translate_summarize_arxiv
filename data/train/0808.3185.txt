    "this result clarified the nature of 3c 273 , which was first identified as a @xmath5-ray emitting agn in cos - b satellite data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 rays from blazars are certainly nonthermal in origin and associated with the radio jets formed by the supermassive black holes that power these sources .",
    "the largest subclass of egret agns are moderate redshift ( @xmath8 ) flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) with blazar properties , including apparent superluminal motion , rapidly variable optical emission , high polarization , and intense broadened optical emission lines .",
    "another subclass of the egret agns consists of @xmath5-ray emitting bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects , which are generally at lower redshifts ( @xmath9  @xmath10 ) and , by definition , have weak or absent optical emission lines in their spectra .",
    "the x - ray selected bl lac ( xbl ) subset were discovered to be a class of tev @xmath5-ray sources by the whipple observatory @xcite .",
    "the common superluminal nature of the first identified @xmath5-ray blazars , namely 3c 273 , 3c 279 , and pks 0528 + 134 , led @xcite to propose a compton - scattering origin for the @xmath5 rays . in this model ,",
    "jet electrons compton - scatter accretion - disk photons that intercept the jet plasma .",
    "the nonthermal jet electrons can also scatter internal synchrotron photons to produce a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) component @xcite .",
    "given the broadened emission lines in the spectra of fsrqs , accretion - disk radiation scattered by surrounding gas of the broad line region ( blr ) will provide a further source of target photons to be scattered to @xmath5-ray energies @xcite , as will radiation from a surrounding dusty torus @xcite . the accretion - disk and scattered radiation will attenuate jet @xmath5-rays through @xmath6 pair - production attenuation @xcite .",
    "expressions for the @xmath5-ray spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars produced by compton scattering processes have been derived and calculated for many specific models of the black - hole / blazar jet environment . in the case of external accretion - disk photons as the target photon source , where the accretion disk is described by an optically thick , geometrically thin thermal @xcite accretion disk , compton - scattered @xmath5-ray spectra were calculated in the thomson regime by @xcite .",
    "calculations of the thomson - scattered spectra for a quasi - isotropic target radiation field formed by blr gas or hot dust were made by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical calculations including both accretion disk and scattered radiation fields , have been made by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "compton scattering in the klein - nishina regime is not so simple to treat compared to analyses restricted to the thomson regime , but is unavoidable for blazar analysis in the era of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( formerly known as _ glast _ ) and the ground - based @xmath5 cherenkov telescopes . for surrounding isotropic radiation fields in the stationary frame of the blazar agn",
    ", @xcite suggested to transform the comoving electron distribution to the stationary frame and then scatter the target photons to @xmath5-ray energies , using the formula first derived by jones @xcite .",
    "this approach is generalized in this paper to surrounding anisotropic radiation fields .",
    "the usual spectral modeling approach proceeds by injecting power - law electrons and evolving these particles while they produce the output synchrotron and compton - scattered radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite calculate electron energy evolution and spectral formation throughout the thomson and klein - nishina regimes for different ratios of synchrotron and isotropic radiation field energy densities .",
    "they show that reduced compton losses in the klein - nishina regime compared to synchrotron losses can lead to spectral hardening of the synchrotron component in the optical / x - ray regime ( noted earlier by * ? ? ?",
    "a difficulty in this approach is that the electron energy - loss rate depends on the photon spectrum of the comoving radiation field , not just the total radiation energy density , and this field evolves with time .",
    "the modeler is faced with the prospect of simultaneously fitting the synchrotron and compton components",
    ". the acceleration scenario may well be over - simplified , and non - power - law particle injection distributions could be more realistic than power - law injection spectra , e.g. , due to nonlinear effects in fermi acceleration .",
    "moreover , a separation between the acceleration and radiation zones may not be justified .    here",
    "we extend a method of blazar analysis recently proposed for tev blazars @xcite that avoids these difficulties .",
    "for a standard @xmath5-ray blazar model , where isotropically distributed electrons spiral in a randomly oriented magnetic field with mean magnetic field strength @xmath1 in the fluid frame , the measured synchrotron flux directly reveals the electron spectrum responsible for the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the only uncertainties are the mean magnetic field @xmath1 , the comoving size scale @xmath11 of the emitting region , and the doppler factor @xmath12^{-1}$ ] ( @xmath13 is the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow ) . with this electron spectrum , we then compton - scatter target photons of the surrounding radiation fields using the head - on approximation to the total compton cross section @xcite , valid when the electron lorentz factor @xmath14 .",
    "this generalizes the approach of @xcite to surrounding anisotropic radiation fields .",
    "the temporally - evolving electron spectrum in blazars can be derived in this approach from simultaneous multiwavelength blazar data .",
    "values of @xmath1 , @xmath15 , and jet power can then be deduced . the related treatment for xbls applied to pks 2155 - 304 , including more details about the derivation of the electron spectrum from the synchrotron component , the derivation and calculations of the ssc component and internal @xmath5-ray opacity by the synchrotron photons , is given by @xcite .",
    "analysis of blazar seds using this approach is presented in section 2 , where formulas to calculate compton - scattered internal and external radiation and a @xmath16-function approximation for @xmath6 opacity from the internal radiation field are given .",
    "derivations of the compton - scattered spectrum for specific examples of external radiation fields consisting of a monochromatic point source of radiation radially behind the jet , a shakura - sunyaev disk model , and a model blr radiation field are derived in section 3 .",
    "discussion of the results is found in section 4 .",
    "we consider a one - zone model for blazar flares .",
    "multiple zones could still be allowed , but the product of the duty cycle and number of zones would have to be small enough that interference of emissions from the different regions would still permit rapid variability . in this case , the emission would still predominantly arise from a single zone .",
    "distinct zones could also emit the bulk of their radiation in different wavebands . in this case",
    ", the cospatiality assumption often made in blazar modeling would not apply . in this regard ,",
    "correlated variability data is essential to test the underlying assumptions made when a one - zone model is employed .",
    "slowly varying radio / ir synchrotron and hard x - ray and low - energy @xmath5-ray compton emissions could involve extended emission regions .    a radiative event from the source emission region that varies on a comoving timescale @xmath17 is related to the observed variability timescale through the relation @xmath18 , where @xmath4 is redshift ; thus the comoving blob radius is @xmath19 .",

    "<S> application of this baseline flat spectrum radio/@xmath5-ray quasar model is considered in view of data from @xmath5-ray telescopes and contemporaneous multi - wavelength campaigns . </S>"
