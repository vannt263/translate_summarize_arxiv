    "infinitesimally thin disks and black holes can be treated by means of the vacuum einstein equations . in both cases boundary value problems are to be solved , cf .  the contribution by g.  neugebauer @xcite .    in the stationary and axially symmetric case",
    "the vacuum einstein equations are equivalent to the ernst equation @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are cylindrical ( weyl- ) coordinates .",
    "( the @xmath4-axis represents the axis of symmetry . ) the full metric can be calculated from the complex ernst potential @xmath5 .    by means of soliton - theoretical techniques it was possible to solve the problem of a rigidly rotating disk of dust in terms of ultraelliptic functions @xcite .",
    "the mathematical structure of this solution allowed a generalization to a class of solutions related to jacobi s inversion problem in the general ( hyperelliptic ) case @xcite .",
    "these solutions turned out to be closely related to finite - gap solutions of the ernst equation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i will discuss a subclass of solutions related to the ultraelliptic case of jacobi s inversion problem .",
    "they contain the kerr solution describing a rotating black hole , the above mentioned solution found by neugebauer and meinel @xcite describing a rigidly rotating disk of dust , and a three - parameter family of solutions recently found by ansorg and meinel @xcite describing differentially rotating disks of dust . in this formulation ,",
    "the solutions differ in the choice of a complex parameter and a real solution of the axisymmetric laplace equation only",
    ". this will provide further insight into a certain parameter limit ( `` ultrarelativistic limit '' ) where the disk solutions coincide with the extreme kerr solution .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that @xmath6 with @xmath7 a bar denoting complex conjugation , @xmath8 and @xmath9 being arbitrary complex parameters , and @xmath10 represents a solution of the ernst equation ( [ ernst ] ) if @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( and the integration paths ) are determined from jacobi s inversion problem @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an arbitrary real solution of the ( axisymmetric ) laplace equation @xmath15 and the real functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 satisfy the differential relations @xmath18 ( as a consequence , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are solutions of the laplace equation as well . ) the ultraelliptic functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 have four independent periods corresponding to the closed integrals in the two - sheeted riemann surface related to ( [ z ] ) as indicated in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "they are called @xmath21- and @xmath22-periods according to the integration contours @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .    sometimes the following reformulation of eqs .",
    "( [ f ] ) , ( [ j ] ) proves to be useful : @xmath27 with @xmath28 note that @xmath12 is now on the other sheet of the riemann surface . introducing @xmath29 and using the obvious relation @xmath30 we obtain",
    "@xmath31 it can easily be verified that the real functions @xmath32 are solutions of the laplace equation and satisfy the same recursion relations ( [ rec ] ) as @xmath33 .",
    "note that an asymptotically flat solution ( @xmath34 at infinity ) is obtained for @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) at infinity .",
    "this condition fixes the integration constants in ( [ rec ] ) .    in the next section",
    "i will discuss physically interesting examples .",
    "they differ in the choice of the potential function @xmath14 ( or @xmath37 ) and the parameter @xmath8 . in all cases",
    "i assume @xmath38",
    "the kerr solution is obtained for real @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath39 and @xmath40 with a positive parameter @xmath41 and @xmath42 from ( [ rec ] ) we obtain @xmath43 the @xmath21-periods in eq .",
    "( [ vtilde ] ) can easily be calculated by means of the residues at the poles @xmath8 and @xmath9 [ note that @xmath44 according to ( [ k12 ] ) ] : @xmath45 by a suitable combination of eqs .",
    "( [ jac2 ] ) this leads to @xmath46 with @xmath47 @xmath48 these intergrals can elementarily be calculated with the final result @xmath49 where the parameters @xmath50 ( mass ) and @xmath51 ( angular momentum ) are related to @xmath8 and @xmath41 according to @xmath52 this is exactly the ernst potential of the kerr solution .",
    "note that the extreme limit ( @xmath53 ) is obtained for @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 ) .",
    "the solution describing the gravitational field of a rigidly rotating disk of dust ( placed at @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) is obtained for @xcite @xmath58 ( integration along the imaginary @xmath59-axis , @xmath60 for @xmath3 , @xmath4 outside the disk ) with @xmath61 from ( [ rec ] ) we obtain @xmath62 here @xmath63 is a real parameters .",
    "( the total mass @xmath50 and the angular momentum @xmath51 of the disk are functions of @xmath64 and @xmath63 . )",
    "it turns out that the solution is regular for @xmath65 where the limit @xmath66 , for finite @xmath50 , leads to @xmath67 . according to ( [ rig ] ) , this means @xmath54 and it can be shown that @xmath68 comparing this with eqs .",
    "( [ vv ] ) , ( [ rr ] ) [ note that @xmath69 and @xmath70 approach @xmath71 for @xmath54 ] , and the final remark of the previous subsection , we are led to the conclusion that the solution approaches exactly the extreme kerr metric ( for @xmath73 ) in the limit @xmath74 . more details concerning this `` ultrarelativistic '' limit can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a three - parameter family of solutions describing differentially rotating disks of dust is obtained for @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath64 is again the ( weyl - coordinate ) radius of the disk , @xmath77 is an arbitrary complex parameter [ we only assume @xmath78 , @xmath79 according to ( [ k12 ] ) ] , and @xmath80 is determined such that the following `` dust condition '' @xcite is satisfied in the disk , i.e.  for @xmath56 , @xmath81 : @xmath82 ^ 2 = 4 \\,\\im a\\ , \\im b , \\quad a=\\frac{f_{,z}}{f+\\bar{f}}\\,\\ , , \\ , b=\\frac{\\bar{f}_{,z}}{f+\\bar{f}}. \\label{dust}\\ ] ]    note that for arbitrary @xmath80 one obtains solutions which might be interpreted as disks consisting of two counter - rotating streams of particles moving on geodesics ( i.e.  two dust components ) , see @xcite .",
    "the condition ( [ dust ] ) guarantees that there is one stream of particles only .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath83 can be calculated afterwards .",
    "the solution depends on the three parameters @xmath64 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . according to ( [ rig ] ) , the rigidly rotating disk of dust ( @xmath86 ) is included for @xmath87 .",
    "the condition ( [ dust ] ) leads to a complicated nonlinear integral equation for @xmath80 which has been solved numerically to an extremely high accuracy , see @xcite .",

    "( normally only @xmath91 itself vanishes at the rim . )",
    "@xmath92 divides the parameter - space into parts with and without ergoregions of the solutions .",
