    "<S> we study these parameters for random graphs .    </S>",
    "<S> although warmth is not a monotone graph property we show it is nevertheless `` statistically monotone , '' , and that for erds - rnyi random graphs @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , the warmth is concentrated on at most two values , and that for most @xmath3 it is concentrated on one value . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the uniform case @xmath4 , and as a corollary obtain that a conjecture of lovsz holds for almost all graphs .    </S>",
