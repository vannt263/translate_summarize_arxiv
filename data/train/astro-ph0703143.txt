    "while magnetic t - tauri type models for low - mass star formation have been reasonably well accepted , there is currently no such picture for the early evolutionary phases of higher mass stars .",
    "many questions , such as whether higher mass stars form via disc accretion , and issues relating to the importance of magnetic fields during high - mass star formation , remain open .",
    "herbig ae / be stars are of considerable interest in attempts to resolve these questions , as they are young stars of intermediate mass ( 2 - 15m@xmath3 ) at the interface between low and high - mass star formation .",
    "in addition , herbig ae / be stars are the most massive stars with a visible pre - main sequence phase .",
    "t tauri stars have relatively strong magnetic fields @xcite and these fields have important physical effects on the accretion flow .",
    "it is generally believed that magnetic fields play a lesser role for stars more massive than the sun , as stars at spectral types a and earlier lack convective outer mantles .",
    "the picture of the role of magnetic accretion as a function of spectral type changed when @xcite found that a large fraction ( 9/11 ) of herbig ae stars show changes in the linear polarisation intrinsic to the h@xmath0 line ( extended to 10/13 with data from * ? ? ?",
    "* )  similar to the fraction ( 9/10 ) of such intrinsic line effects in t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the origin for these h@xmath0 line effects in both t tauri and herbig ae stars is believed to be the result of the fact that _ emission line _ photons from the central object are scattered off a rotating accretion disc with an inner hole @xcite . from here",

    "* ) , and wholly consistent with all herbig be stars being embedded in flattened circumstellar media ( c.f .",
    "classical be stars ) , their h@xmath0 polarisation behaviour is very different from that of herbig ae / t tauri stars , as it is not the line but the continuum that is found to be polarised , with the h@xmath0 line `` depolarised '' with respect to the continuum @xcite .",
    "so , in summary , the emission line photons are intrinsically polarised compared to the continuum for herbig ae and t tauri stars , but are depolarised relative to the continuum for herbig be stars .",
    "the difference in the behaviour of the linear polarisation across h@xmath0 between the herbig be and ae stars may be an indication that there is a transition in the hertzsprung - russell diagram from magnetic accretion at spectral type a to disc accretion at spectral type b. however , alternatively , @xcite considered the option that the compact polarised h@xmath0 emission occurring in the herbig ae and t tauri stars may be masked in the herbig be stars due to their much higher levels of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we therefore designed an observational test to distinguish between these two options .",
    "the test involves linear spectropolarimetry across less opaque , higher excitation emission lines that can be expected to arise in the same location as the compact h@xmath0 component that causes the line polarisation in the herbig ae stars .",
    "if the extension and optical depth of h@xmath0 emission masks the evidence for a compact source in herbig be stars , then higher balmer ( h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 ) observations should reveal position angle rotations ( @xmath10 loops ) in the herbig be group .",
    "however , if these angle rotations are not observed at these lines in the herbig be population , while they do appear at h@xmath0 among the herbig ae stars , this would suggest that the circumstellar environments of herbig be stars are physically different from those of herbig ae stars .",
    "the goal of this paper is thus to perform spectropolarimetry of h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 observations in early herbig be stars .",

    "the isis spectrograph , a calcite block , and a rotating half - wave plate were used for the observations , as well as a dekker and slit .",
    "the dekker had three 5  holes , separated by 18  , while a 1  slit width was used for all object observations .",
    "the calcite block acted to separate the incoming light into two perpendicular rays , the o ( ordinary ) and e ( extraordinary ) rays , so one image contains a set of o and e rays for the image and two sets for the sky .",

    "below the triplots , the _ qu _ graphs are shown .    as expected , the line emission is stronger when going to lower order recombination lines .",
    "indeed , h@xmath2 emission is obviously present , but barely exceeds the continuum , as it fills in the underlying photospheric absorption line .",
    "nevertheless , even the h@xmath2 line shows a depolarisation similar to h@xmath0 , despite its much smaller transition probability .",
    "the intrinsic polarisation measured from the line excursions is @xmath29 and 3@xmath30 ( with errors of order 3@xmath30 ) respectively for the @xmath5 and @xmath4 band data . in all bands ,",
    "the line - effect is best described as depolarisation , although there is a somewhat more complex structure in h@xmath0 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the continuum polarisation and pa across the @xmath4 and @xmath31 bands are quite similar , with the difference being mainly due to the slight difference in intrinsic pa between the epochs of observation .",
    "the behaviour in _ qu _ space is also very similar across all three lines , although the blue - to - red line ratio has changed between the two observations .",
    "based on the similar depolarisations in the polarisation spectra as well as the similar excursion in _ qu _ space , we conclude that the ( de- )  polarisation mechanism responsible for the appearance at h@xmath0 is also acting at h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , a small - scale electron scattering disc , seen close to edge - on , is the most plausible explanation for the phenomena observed in mwc  361 .",
    "let us now move to the data for @xmath9  ori , which are plotted in the lower panels of fig .",
    "this object shows depolarisation in our data at both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , but it does not show any appreciable effect in the @xmath4 band data of @xcite taken nine years earlier .",
    "however , @xcite do observe a polarisation change at h@xmath0 and closer examination of the _ qu _ plots shows that the end of the excursions at both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lie near the continuum cluster for h@xmath0 of @xcite .",
    "this corroborates their suggestion that the decreased emission level at h@xmath0 at the time of observation resulted in a marked drop in the percentage of linearly polarised scattered starlight from the star .    also noteworthy",
    "is the fact that we see a line effect at h@xmath2 in the first place , although the line is in absorption . for an ordinary main - sequence star of the same spectral type as @xmath9  ori , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 are in absorption .",
    "the line effect across h@xmath1 appears to coincide only with the emission peaks , and not with the absorption at line centre .",
    "there is some weak emission at h@xmath2 as well - there is just not enough to fill in the absorption . never before has such a weak emission line",
    "been observed to have a polarisation effect .",
    "this indicates that , as long as the data is of a high enough quality , only moderate amounts of emission are needed to cause a detectable line effect .",
    "we obtained data in both the _ b _ and _ r _ band during the same run of the herbig ae star mwc  480 , and these are shown in fig .",
    "mwc  480 shows no line effects in the @xmath5 band , but a strong line effect at h@xmath0 is present .",
    "contrary to the objects discussed above , the appearance in _ qu _ space is that of a loop .",
    "there is evidence of emission at both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , and as we showed in the previous subsection , if there would have been a line effect , our fairly high signal - to - noise data might have revealed it . in the case of the herbig",
    "be stars , the polarisation is due to electron scattering in a disc , which does not result in a loop in the _ qu _ diagram .",
    "the non - detection in these lines , while we do find an intrinsic line effect at h@xmath0 data taken nearly simultaneously is a further indication that the polarisation mechanism in herbig ae stars may be different from that in the earlier objects .      for five out of the eight herbig be stars that have been observed at h@xmath1 , we observe depolarisations .",
    "a comparison with existing h@xmath0 data shows that the intrinsic polarisation angle is similar at both h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 .",
    "in one case , no line - effect was detected previously at h@xmath0 , but there does seem to be one at shorter wavelengths now .",
    "this is most likely due to the intrinsic variability of the hydrogen recombination emission . the detection statistic , that more than half , but not all , of the objects are found to show a line effect is consistent with previous studies such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "only one of the herbig ae type stars displays a line effect at h@xmath1 ( mwc  120 , with a spectral type of a0 , the earliest herbig ae star ) .",

    "observations in the spectral range of b4-b9 could help us understand what could cause this possible shift from magnetospheric accretion in herbig ae stars to disc accretion in early herbig be stars .",
    "we presented spectropolarimetric data on eight herbig be stars at h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , and we found five cases where the behaviour could be described as `` depolarisation '' .",
    "two herbig be stars show no polarisation line effects , and only one transitional object ( at spectral type b6 ) may show hints of a @xmath23 loop .",
    "furthermore , the observed line effects are consistent across all three observed hydrogen lines , indicating that optical depth is not a major factor in the observed linear polarimetry across emission lines in herbig stars .",
    "this leads us to conclude that it is most likely that a different accretion mechanism is operating in herbig be stars than in herbig ae stars .",
    "the fact that the role of magnetic fields may be diminishing when going to earlier spectral types could , at first sight , be considered at odds with the fact that up to 30 - 50% of herbig stars were found to be significant emitters of x - rays @xcite , some of which have very early b - types . however , the higher spatial resolution of current x - ray satellites , in particular chandra , can be utilised to investigate whether the x - ray photons are intrinsic to the herbig star , or whether they are originating from a low - mass companion ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a recent infrared ( ir ) coronographic imaging and chandra study of the extremely early herbig be star mwc  297 , @xcite and @xcite have argued that the x - rays likely originate from a low - mass companion .",
    "interestingly , an increase in the number of low - mass companions ( `` clustering '' ) with stellar mass and spectral type amongst herbig stars was found by @xcite , which @xcite considered as yielding a higher chance for misidentification of x - rays towards earlier type herbig stars .",
    "therefore , the current status on the origin of x - rays of herbig ae / be stars suggests that t tauri and some herbig ae stars may be intrinsic x - ray emitters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , while early herbig be stars are likely not .",
    "this picture on the x - rays from herbig stars as a function of spectral type can be reconciled with the linear spectropolarimetry results presented in this paper if there is a `` fading '' of the importance of magnetic fields at spectral types earlier than b4-b9 .",
    "it is interesting , however , that @xcite recently reported the detection of a significant magnetic field in the herbig be star mwc  361 , as this is also the object for which @xcite found a narrow pa rotation in the red wing of h@xmath0 , on top of an otherwise well - defined depolarisation .",
    "we finally mention that infrared interferometry observations by @xcite suggest that the early herbig be stars ( b0-b3 ) are discrepant in terms of the `` disc size - source luminosity relationship '' that works so well for herbig ae and late herbig be systems .",
    "this discrepancy could possibly be caused by the fact that different accretion scenarios are operating in the early herbig be stars and the herbig ae stars .",
    "this appears to be in line with the line polarimetry data of herbig ae / be stars currently available : the herbig ae stars show intrinsic line polarisation , similar to t tauri stars , and consistent with magnetospheric accretion , while the majority of herbig be stars show depolarisation , consistent with disc accretion .",

    "there is an increase in @xmath5 band continuum polarisation between the two nights of observation , but despite the large difference in continuum polarisation between @xmath5 and @xmath4 , the intrinsic pa agrees with the data taken on the 29th .",
    "the shape of the depolarisation effect and ( q , u ) smear are similar to those observed by @xcite , although the @xmath4 band continuum polarisation they record is noticeably higher .",
    "they attribute the smear in the ( q , u ) diagram to changing continuum polarisation , which is notable between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in our observations and , to a lesser extent , across the bands themselves .",

    "these objects show line effects at only some of the observed lines . bd  + 404124 shows ( fig .",
    "@xmath39 ) depolarisation at h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , with corresponding excursions in the ( q , u ) plots , but there are no more than vague suggestions of a line effect at h@xmath2 .",
    "both the continuum polarisation and pa increase slightly in the @xmath5 band from the @xmath4 band observations , possibly causing the slight change in shape of the line effect between h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 .",
    "there is , however , clear and quite strong emission at all three lines , so the lack of a clear effect at h@xmath2 is most likely due to the faintness of bd  + 404124 and may become apparent with longer exposure observations .",
    "the first point of interest for mwc  147 is the fact that the emission lines have different shapes in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands ( fig .",
    "@xmath40 ) . h@xmath0 ( observed 18/12/1999 ) is double peaked with a v / r peak ratio @xmath41 1 , i.e. v  @xmath41  r , while h@xmath1 ( observed 28/09/2004 ) is double peaked with v @xmath42 r. h@xmath2 appears single peaked , with the emission slightly displaced to the r side of the absorption feature .",

    "there are definitely line effects at h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , with little sign of effects at h@xmath2 , but it is unclear if the effects are depolarisation effects , or qu loops .",

    "the high level of continuum polarisation of the objects , @xmath461.2@xmath17 for gu  cma and @xmath464.2@xmath17 for il  cep , and the high quality of the data means that it is unlikely that these objects exhibit undetected line effects , and their electron scattering discs are expected to be relatively pole - on .",
