    "alfa ( palfa ) survey , a deep pulsar survey of low galactic latitudes @xcite . given its short pointings ,",
    "the palfa survey is especially sensitive to binary pulsars in tight orbits , as demonstrated by the discovery of the relativistic binary pulsar psr j1906 + 0746 , which did not require any acceleration search techniques @xcite .",
    "another aspect of this and other modern galactic plane surveys is the high time and frequency resolution , which allow the detection of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) at high dispersion measures @xcite and therefore greatly expand the volume in which these can be discovered .",
    "one of the innovative aspects of this survey is the use of distributed , volunteer computing .",
    "one of the main motivations is the detection of extremely tight ( down to @xmath3 minutes ) binaries , for which acceleration and jerk searches become computationally challenging tasks .",

    "respectively ) . psr  j1952 + 2630was the first binary pulsar discovered with the e@h pipeline @xcite . at that time",
    "the few observations available allowed only a rough estimate of the orbital parameters of this msp based on doppler measurements of the spin period .",
    "these already showed that psr  j1952 + 2630has a massive wd companion ( @xmath4 assuming @xmath5 ) , and may have evolved from an intermediate - mass x - ray binary ( imxb ) .",
    "building on the analysis by @xcite , we present in this paper the phase - coherent timing solution of psr  j1952 + 2630resulting from dedicated follow - up observations with the arecibo telescope , which provides orbital parameters far more precise than those previously determined .",
    "our timing solution also shows the system is relatively young ( @xmath6 = 77  myr ) .",
    "it is commonly accepted that msps are spun  up to their high spin frequencies via accretion of mass and angular momentum from a companion star @xcite . in this recycling phase",
    "the system is observable as an x - ray binary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , binary pulsars , such as psr  j1952 + 2630 , with relatively heavy wds ( co or onemg wds ) are less common in nature .",

    "here we distinguish imxbs from other x - ray binaries as systems that leave behind a massive wd companion rather than a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "some of these imxb systems with donor stars of @xmath7 could also be classified observationally as be / x - ray binaries since these stars are of spectral class b3 - 4 with emission lines .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a detailed study of the recycling process of pulsars via both lmxbs and imxbs and highlighted their similarities and differences .",

    "following its discovery in 2010 july psr  j1952 + 2630was observed during palfa survey observing sessions using the usual survey observing set - up : the 7-beam alfa receiver with the mock spectrometersastro / mock.shtml ] . in this",
    "set - up , @xmath8322  mhz alfa observing band was split into two overlapping sub - bands centred at 1300.1680  mhz and 1450.1680  mhz , each with a bandwidth of 172.0625  mhz .",
    "all timing observations using this set - up were performed with alfa s central beam , and were typically 5 - 10 minutes in duration .    a dedicated timing program at the arecibo observatory started in 2011 november .",
    "the dedicated timing observations took data using the `` l - wide '' receiver .",
    "these data were divided into four non - overlapping , contiguous sub - bands recorded by the mock spectrometers in search - mode .",
    "each sub - band has 172  mhz of bandwidth divided in 2048 channels , sampled every @xmath883.3  @xmath9s .",
    "together the four sub - bands cover slightly more than the maximum bandwidth of the receiver , 580  mhz , and are centred at 1444  mhz .    at the start of the dedicated timing campaign ,",
    "three 3-hour observing sessions on consecutive days were conducted to obtain nearly complete orbital coverage , with the goal of detecting , or constraining a shapiro delay signature caused by the pulsar s signal passing through its companions gravitational potential well .",
    "subsequently , monthly observations of 1  hour each were used for the next 11  months to monitor the pulsar , and refine our timing solution .    for analysis ,",
    "each observation was divided into segments no longer than 15-minutes for each of the separate sub - bands .",
    "each segment was folded offline using the appropriate topocentric spin period using ` prepfold`program from ` presto`sransom / presto/ ] .",
    "the resulting folded data files were converted to psrfits format @xcite with ` pam`from the ` psrchive`suite of pulsar analysis tools .",
    "data files were fully time and frequency integrated , and times - of - arrival ( toas ) were computed using ` pat`from ` psrchive ` .",
    "the result was a single toa for each @xmath10 minutes of observing for each sub - band .",
    "toas for the different sub - bands were computed using a separate analytic template produced by fitting von mises functions to the sum of profiles from the closely spaced three - day observing campaign .",
    "profiles from different observations were aligned using the pulsar ephemeris .",
    "timing analysis was performed with the ` tempo2`software @xcite .",
    "the phase - coherent timing solution determined fits the 418 pulse times - of - arrival .",
    "our timing solution accurately models the timing data , leaving no systematic trends as a function of epoch , or orbital phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals ] ) .    ]",
    "the timing analysis of psr  j1952 + 2630has resulted in the determination of astrometric , spin , and keplerian orbital parameters .",
    "the fitted timing parameters , as well as some derived parameters can be found in table  [ tab : timing ] .",
    "the timing solution also includes a marginal detection of the proper motion of the pulsar .",
    "given the combination of a relatively large observed mass function , @xmath11 ( see table  [ tab : timing ] ) and a small orbital eccentricity , @xmath12 , it is clear that psr  j1952 + 2630has a massive wd companion .",
    "the minimum companion mass is @xmath13 , obtained for an orbital inclination angle of @xmath14 and an assumed ns mass , @xmath15 .",
    "the small eccentricity excludes a ns companion star since the release of the gravitational binding energy alone , during the core collapse , would make the post - sn eccentricity much larger ( @xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in contrast with the observed value . furthermore , no known double - neutron star system has @xmath17 , according to the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite .",
    "thus a double ns system is not possible and psr  j1952 + 2630must have a massive wd companion , i.e. a carbon - oxygen ( co ) or an oxygen - neon - magnesium ( onemg )  wd . the upper ( chandrasekhar )",
    "mass limit for a rigidly rotating wd is @xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore we conclude that the wd companion star is in the mass interval @xmath19 .",
    "the distance to psr  j1952 + 2630 , estimated using the observed dispersion measure , and the ` ne2001`model of galactic free electrons , is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in dm - derived distances using the ` ne2001`model can , in some cases , be up to a factor of @xmath21 off from the true distance .",
    "unfortunately , this places the binary system too far away to hope to optically detect the wd companion with current telescopes . as expected , a search of optical and infrared catalogs yielded no counterpart .",
    "psr  j1952 + 2630has a spin period of @xmath22 and one of the highest values of the spin period derivative , @xmath23 for any known recycled pulsar and by far the highest value for a mildly recycled pulsar with a massive wd companion . the observed value of @xmath24 is contaminated by kinematic effects ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : future ] ) .",
    "however , the contamination is only @xmath80.01% , assuming our current value of the proper motion .",
    "the combination of @xmath25 and @xmath24 of psr  j1952 + 2630yields a small characteristic age , @xmath26 .",
    "the characteristic age of a pulsar should only be considered a rough order - of - magnitude estimate of the true age of the pulsar ( i.e. time since recycling terminated ) .",
    "thus the _ true _ ages are quite uncertain for recycled pulsars with large @xmath27-values of several gyr @xcite , unless a cooling age of their wd companion can be determined .",
    "however , the true ages of recycled pulsars with small values of @xmath28 ( less than a few @xmath29 ) are relatively close to the characteristic age .",
    "hence , we conclude that psr  j1952 + 2630is young , for a recycled pulsar , and in secs  [ subsec : age - spin ] and [ subsubsec : isochrones ] we discuss its true age ( i.e. its actual age since it switched - on as a recycled radio pulsar ) and also constrain its spin evolution in the past and in the future .      given the current timing data , the binary motion of psr  j1952 + 2630can be accurately modelled without requiring any relativistic , post - keplerian parameters .",
    "unfortunately , this means that the masses of the pulsar and its wd companion can not be precisely determined by the current timing model .",
    "nevertheless , a @xmath30 analysis was performed to investigate what constraints the lack of a shapiro delay detection imposes on the make - up and geometry of the binary system ( i.e. the mass of the pulsar , @xmath31 , and that of its companion , @xmath32 , as well as the binary system inclination , @xmath33 , by using the mass - function ) .",

    "the @xmath30-map was computed for @xmath32 between 0 and 1.5 @xmath34 , in steps of 0.001 @xmath34 , and @xmath35 from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.001 .    for each point in the @xmath30-map",
    "the timing model was re - fit , holding the values of @xmath32 and @xmath35 fixed .",
    "the resulting @xmath30 values were converted to probabilities by following @xcite , and then normalized .",
    "the 1- , 2- , and 3-@xmath36 contours were chosen such that they contain @xmath868.3 , @xmath895.5 , and @xmath899.7  % of the allowed binary system configurations .",
    "based on this analysis we know the binary system can not be edge - on ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the inclination angle is constrained to be be @xmath38 for @xmath39 , at the 3-@xmath36 level .",

    "the red dashed lines trace constant pulsar mass .",
    "the grey region in the right is excluded because the pulsar mass must be larger than 0 .",
    "the two stars are the results from the two simulations of the binary system s evolution ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : casebb ] ) .",
    "[ fig : m2cosi ] ]    however , based on the massive companion , and small , but significantly non - zero eccentricity , we expect that with our current timing precision we will measure two ( or possibly three ) post - keplerian parameters precisely enough to provide a stringent test of relativistic gravity , within the next 10 years ( see sec .",

    "donor star initiates rlo .",
    "the post - ce evolution , calculated in detail in this paper , is responsible for recycling the ns via case  bb rlo when the helium star companion expands to initiate a final mass - transfer episode .",
    "psr  j1952 + 2630is currently observed as a mildly recycled radio pulsar orbiting a massive white  dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the system will merge in @xmath41  gyr , possibly leading to a @xmath42-ray burst - like event and the formation of a single black hole .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ]    in general , binary pulsars with a co  wd companion can form via different formation channels ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "pulsars with co wds in orbits of @xmath43  23  days , like psr  j1952 + 2630(@xmath44 hr ) , are believed to have formed via a common envelope ( ce ) scenario .",
    "such systems originate from imxbs which have very large values of @xmath45 prior to the onset of the mass transfer .",
    "these systems are characterized by donor stars with masses between @xmath46 , and very wide orbits up to @xmath47  days .",
    "donor stars near the tip of the red giant branch or on the asymptotic giant branch evolve via late case  b rlo or case  c rlo , respectively . as a result",
    ", these donor stars develop a deep convective envelope as they enter the giant phase , before filling their roche  lobe .",
    "these stars respond to mass loss by expanding , which causes them to overfill their roche  lobe even more .",
    "binaries where mass transfer occurs from a more massive donor star to a less massive accreting ns shrink in size , causing further overfilling of the donor star s roche  lobe , which further enhances mass loss .",
    "this process leads to a dynamically unstable , runaway mass transfer and the formation of a ce @xcite .",
    "however , the wide orbit prior to the rlo is also the reason why these systems survive the ce and spiral - in phase , since the binding energy of donor star s envelope becomes weaker with advanced stellar age , and therefore the envelope is easier to eject , thereby avoiding a merger event .    given that the duration of the ce and spiral - in phase is quite short ( @xmath48 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the ns can only accrete @xmath49 during this phase , assuming that its accretion is limited by the eddington accretion rate ( a few @xmath50 ) .",
    "this small amount is not enough to even mildly recycle the pulsar . instead",
    ", the ns is thought to be recycled during the subsequent so - called case  bb rlo @xcite .",
    "this post - ce mass - transfer phase is a result of the naked helium star ( the stripped core of the original imxb donor star ) filling its roche  lobe when it expands to become a giant during helium shell burning .",
    "hence , for the purpose of understanding the recycling of psr  j1952 + 2630we only have to consider this epoch of evolution in detail . a complete overview the full progenitor evolution of the system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] .      binary evolution for ns  massive  wd systems have been studied using detailed calculations of the case  bb rlo we applied the langer stellar evolution code ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , none of the previously computed models produced systems sufficiently similar to that of psr  j1952 + 2630 .",
    "we used the same code to study what progenitor systems can result in psr  j1952 + 2630-like binaries , the case  bb rlo of these systems , and the nature of the wd companion .",
    "the masses of the wd and the ns ( @xmath32 and @xmath31 , respectively ) are not known from timing at this stage ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : timingconstraints ] ) . in order to limit the number of trial computations",
    ", we assumed @xmath15 and performed various calculations with different values of initial orbital period and initial mass of the helium donor star , @xmath51 .",
    "the young age of psr  j1952 + 2630implies that @xmath45 ( now 9.4  hours ) has not changed much by gravitational wave radiation since the termination of the mass transfer ( it was at most @xmath89.6  hours ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "therefore we only select progenitor solutions of our modelling that have similar orbital periods .",
    "we also impose the criterion @xmath520.931.48@xmath53 , to be consistent with the minimum companion mass derived from our timing solution .",
    "two solutions satisfying our selection criteria are shown in fig .",

    "the first solution ( blue solid line ) is for a @xmath54 helium star leading to formation of a @xmath55 onemg  wd .",
    "the second solution ( red dashed line ) is for a @xmath56 helium star leading to a @xmath57 co  wd . in both cases we assumed a helium star metallicity of @xmath58 ( solar metallicity ) , a reasonable assumption given that their @xmath867 @xmath59 progenitors had short lifetimes of @xmath8100  myr and",
    "thus belong to galactic population  i stars .",
    "the second solution predicts a shorter pulsar spin period at the termination of accretion , and therefore imposes a less strict limit on the mass - accretion efficiency ; see sec .",

    "here we assumed @xmath65 ( a typical value for accretion of helium rich matter , * ? ? ? * ) and allowed for the actual accretion rate to be somewhere in the interval 30300% of this value .",

    "following eqn .",

    "the reason for the possibility of a lower initial spin period in case psr  j1952 + 2630has a co  wd companion , is simply that the helium star progenitor of a co  wd has a lower mass and therefore evolves on a longer time - scale , thereby increasing @xmath86 .",

    "this is the first time an accretion efficiency has been constrained for a recycled pulsar which evolved via case  bb rlo . in contrast , the accretion efficiency of millisecond pulsars formed in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) has been shown to be much lower , about 30% in some cases @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference in accretion efficiencies may be related to the extremely high mass - transfer rates during case  bb rlo which could influence the accretion flow geometry and thus @xmath64 .",

    ", one must take the constraints obtained from binary evolution and accretion physics into account .",
    "therefore , if the case  bb rlo is not able to spin  up the pulsar to a value smaller than , for example , 15  ms , then the true age of psr  j1952 + 2630cannot be much more than 40  myr for all values of @xmath97 . for closer binary systems similar to psr  j1952 + 2630where a cooling age determination of the wd is possible , such a measurement could be useful for constraining the birth period of the pulsar , as well as the system s accretion efficiency .    also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isochrones ] is the future spin evolution of psr  j1952 + 2630until the system merges in about 3.4  gyr .",

    "massive  wd binaries with much shorter orbital periods , to which palfa is sensitive @xcite .",
    "the unique location of psr  j1952 + 2630with respect to other known recycled pulsars with a massive wd companion ( marked with blue diamonds ) is also clear from this figure .",
    "it is seen that only three other systems may share a past location in the @xmath25-@xmath24 diagram similar to that of psr  j1952 + 2630(if @xmath97 ) .",
    "this could suggest that such surviving post - ce systems are often formed with small values of @xmath45 which cause them to merge rapidly  either during the case  bb rlo or shortly thereafter due to gravitational wave radiation .",
    "we now investigate the future use of psr  j1952 + 2630as a gravitational laboratory .",
    "looking at table  [ tab : timing ] , we can see that the eccentricity , @xmath98 , and longitude of periastron , @xmath99 , can be measured quite precisely , in the latter case to within 1.2@xmath100 , despite the small absolute value of the eccentricity , 4.1(1 ) @xmath101 .",
    "if we assume a mass of 1.35 @xmath59 for the pulsar and 1.1 @xmath59 for the wd , then general relativity predicts that @xmath99 should increase at a rate @xmath102 , which given the precision of @xmath99 implies that the effect should be detectable in the next few years .",
    "measuring it will eventually give us an estimate of the total mass of the system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , thanks to psr  j1952 + 2630 s rather short orbital period , the shortest among recycled pulsar  massive wd systems ,",
    "the rate of gravitational wave emission is much higher than for any other such system .",
    "this emission will cause the orbit to decay .",
    "for the same assumptions as above , the orbital period should change at a rate @xmath103 .",
    "as previously mentioned , this will cause the system to merge within about 3.4 gyr .",
    "the orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves is not measurable at present but it should be detectable in the near future . in order to verify this , we made simulations of future timing of this pulsar that assume similar timing precision as at present ( a single 18-@xmath9s toa every 15 minutes for each of two 300-mhz bands centred around 1400 mhz ) .",
    "we assume two campaigns in 2015 and 2020 , where the full orbit is sampled a total of 8 times , spread evenly for each of those years .",
    "the total observing time of 72 hours for each of those years is a realistic target .",
    "these simulations indicate that by the year 2020 @xmath104 should be detectable with 12-@xmath36 significance and @xmath105 to about 9-@xmath36 significance .",

    "[ fig : mass_mass_sim ] .",
    "we plot the 1-@xmath36 bands allowed by the ` measurement ' of a particular parameter .",
    "the figure shows several interesting features .",
    "the first is that even with these measurements of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , it is not possible to determine the two masses accurately from them , given the way their 1-@xmath36 uncertainty bands intersect in the mass - mass diagram .",
    "the 1-@xmath36 band of @xmath106 ( the orthometric amplitude of the shapiro delay , see freire & wex 2010 ) intersects the others at a rather sharp angle and can in principle be used to determine the masses more accurately . however , at the moment it is not clear whether @xmath106 is precisely measurable . a more massive companion in a less inclined orbit yields more pessimistic expectations , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_mass_sim ] .",
    "fortunately , very precise masses are not required to perform a test of general relativity using @xmath105 and @xmath104 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_mass_sim ] , the bands allowed by @xmath105 and @xmath104 are nearly parallel .",
    "as the precision of these measurements improves general relativity is tested by the requirement that the two bands still overlap .",
    "[ fig : mass_mass_sim ] also shows that even if we could determine @xmath106 precisely , the precision of this @xmath105-@xmath106-@xmath104 test will be limited by the precision of the measurement of @xmath105 , because its uncertainty only decreases with @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 is the timing baseline ) , while for @xmath109 the measurement uncertainty decreases with @xmath110 .    eventually , though , the uncertainty of the measurement of @xmath105 will become very small . at that stage",
    "the precision of this test will be limited by the precision of @xmath104 , which is limited by the lack of precise knowledge of the kinematic contributions @xcite : @xmath111 where the subscript `` obs '' indicated the observed quantity , @xmath9 is the total proper motion , @xmath112 is the distance to the pulsar and @xmath113 is the ( distance dependent ) difference between the galactic acceleration of the system and that of the solar system barycentre ( ssb ) , projected along the direction from the ssb to the system . at present these can not be estimated because the proper motion has not yet been measured precisely .",
    "however , they likely represent the ultimate constraint to the precision of this gr test , as in the case of psr  b1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "for that reason , we now estimate the magnitude of these kinematic effects .",
    "if we assume that the final proper motion is of the same order of magnitude as what is observed now ( @xmath114 ) , then at the assumed dm - distance of 9.6  kpc the kinematic contribution to @xmath104 will be about @xmath115 .",
    "this is four times smaller than @xmath116 , as defined above , which means that if we ca nt determine the distance accurately , then the real value for the intrinsic orbital decay , @xmath117 , can not be measured with a relative precision better than about 25  % .",
    "things improve if the proper motion turns out to be smaller .",
    "is such a measurement useful ?",
    "the surprising answer is that it is likely to be so . for pulsar - wd systems , alternative theories of gravity , like scalar - tensor theories",
    "( see * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    "predict the emission of dipolar gravitational waves , which would result in an increased rate of orbital decay . in the case of psr  j1738",
    "+ 0333 , the orbital decay for that system was measured only with a significance of 8-@xmath36 . however , the absolute difference between the @xmath104 predicted by gr and the observed value is so small that it introduces the most stringent constraints ever on these gravity theories @xcite .",
    "the implication is that for psr  j1952 + 2630 , one should be able to derive similarly low limits .",
    "however , if the proper motion is significantly smaller , and/or if we are able to determine the distance independently , then this system can provide a much more stringent test of alternative theories of gravity .",
    "the main reason for this is that the limiting factor of the psr j1738 + 0333 test is the limited precision in the measurement of the component masses @xcite which would not be an issue for psr  j1952 + 2630 , given the tighter constraints on the total mass that will eventually be derived from @xmath105 .",
    "we have presented phase - coherent timing of psr  j1952 + 2630 .",
    "our timing model includes precise determinations of parameters describing the pulsar spin - down , astrometry and binary motion .",
    "no post - keplerian orbital parameters are required .",
    "however , detailed modelling suggests the current pulsar  massive wd binary system evolved via post - ce case  bb rlo with an accretion efficiency which exceeded the eddington limit by a factor of 13 .",
    "we presented , for the first time , a detailed chemical abundance structure of an onemg  wd orbiting a pulsar .    by projecting psr  j1952 + 2630 s orbital evolution into the future we estimate it will merge with its wd companion in @xmath83.4  gyr due to the orbital decay from gravitational wave emission .",
    "unfortunately , psr  j1952 + 2630is too distant to make a detection of the cooling age of the pulsar s wd companion . in the case of the discovery of a less distant analog of psr  j1952 + 2630such",
    "a measurement could make it possible to constrain the braking index of the recycled pulsar , and/or the accretion efficiency during the case  bb rlo - phase .",
    "also , timing observations over the next 10 years will result in the detection of the advance of periastron , and the orbital decay , enabling a test of general relativity .",
    "finally , additional timing may also further elucidate the nature of the companion , and will permit psr  j1952 + 2630to be used to perform gravitational tests .",
