    "random matrix models and their large dimension behavior have been an important subject of study in mathematical physics and statistics since wishart and wigner . global fluctuations of the eigenvalues ( that is , linear functionals of the eigenvalues ) of random matrices have been widely investigated in the last decade ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the trend of these investigations is that for a wide class of converging random matrix models , the non - normalized trace asymptotically behaves like a gaussian variable whose variance only depends on macroscopic parameters such as moments .",
    "the philosophy of these results , together with the freeness results of voiculescu served as a motivation for our series of papers on second order freeness .",
    "one of the main achievements of the free probability theory of voiculescu @xcite was an abstract description via the notion of  freeness \" of the expectation of these gaussian variables for a large class of non - commuting tuples of random matrices .    in the previous articles of this series @xcite we showed that for many interesting ensembles of random matrices an analogue of the results of voiculescu for expectations holds also true on the level of variances as well ; thus pointing in the direction that the structure of random matrices and the fine structure of their eigenvalues can be studied in much more detail by using the new concept of  second order freeness \" .",
    "one of the main obstacles for such a detailed study was the absence of an effective machinery for doing concrete calculations in this framework .",
    "within free probability theory of first order , such a machinery was provided by voiculescu with the concept of the @xmath0-transform , and by speicher with the concept of free cumulants ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "one of the main achievements of the present article is to develop a theory of second order cumulants ( and show that the original definition of second order freeness from part i of this series @xcite is equivalent to the vanishing of mixed second order cumulants ) and provide the corresponding @xmath0-transform machinery .    in section [ section2 ]",
    "we will give a more detailed ( but still quite condensed ) survey of the connection between voiculescu s free probability theory and random matrix theory .",
    "we will there also provide the main motivation , notions and concepts for our extension of this theory to the level of fluctuations ( second order ) , as well as the statement of our main results concerning second order cumulants and @xmath0-transforms .    having first and second order freeness it is , of course , a natural question whether this theory can be generalized to higher orders .",
    "it turns out that this is the case , most of the general theory is the same for all orders .",
    "so we will in this paper consider freeness of all orders from the very beginning and develop a general theory of higher order freeness and higher order cumulants . let us , however , emphasize that first and second order freeness seem to be more important than the higher order ones . actually , we can prove some of the most important results ( e.g. the @xmath0-transform machinery ) only for first and second order , mainly because of the complexity of the underlying combinatorial objects .    the basic combinatorial notion behind the ( usual )",
    "free cumulants are non - crossing partitions .",
    "basically , passage to higher order free cumulants corresponds to a change to multi - annular non - crossing permutations @xcite , or more general objects which we call  partitioned permutations \" . for much of the conceptual framework",
    "there is no difference between different levels of freeness , however for many concrete questions it seems that increasing the order makes some calculations much harder .",
    "this relates to the fact that @xmath1-th order freeness is described in terms of planar permutations which connect points on @xmath1 different circles .",
    "whereas enumeration of all non - crossing permutations in the case of one circle is quite easy , the case of two circles gets more complicated , but is still feasible ; for the case of three or more circles , however , the answer does not seem to be of a nice compact form .",
    "in the present paper we develop the notion and combinatorial machinery for freeness of all orders by a careful analysis of the main example : unitarily invariant random matrices .",
    "we start with the calculation of mixed correlation functions for random matrices and use the structure which we observe there as a motivation for our combinatorial setup . in this way the concept of partitioned permutations and the moment  cumulant relations appear quite canonically .",
    "we want to point out that even though our notion of second and higher order freeness is modeled on the situation found for correlation functions of random matrices , this notion and theory also have some far - reaching applications .",
    "let us mention in this respect two points .",
    "firstly , recently one of us @xcite developed a quite general theory for fluctuations of characters and shapes of random young diagrams contributing to many natural representations of symmetric groups .",
    "the results presented there are closely ( though , not explicitly ) related to combinatorics of higher order cumulants .",
    "this connection will be studied in detail in the part iv of this series @xcite where we prove that under some mild technical conditions jucys - murphy elements , which arise naturally in the study of symmetric groups , are examples of free random variables of higher order .    in another direction",
    ", the description of subfactors in von neumann algebras via planar algebras @xcite relies very much on the notions of annular non - crossing partitions and thus resembles the combinatorial objects lying at the basis of our theory of second order freeness .",
    "this indicates that our results could have some relevance for subfactors .",
    "in section [ section2 ] we will give a compact survey of the connection between voiculescu s free probability theory and random matrix theory , provide the main motivation , notions and concepts for our extension of this theory to the level of fluctuations ( second order ) , as well as the statement of our main results concerning second order cumulants and @xmath0-transforms .",
    "we will also make a few general remarks about higher order freeness .",
    "in section [ section3 ] we will introduce the basic notions and relevant results on permutations , partitions , classical cumulants , haar unitary random matrices , and the weingarten function .    in section [ sec : correlation ]",
    "we study the correlation functions ( classical cumulants of traces ) of random matrix models .",
    "we will see how those are related to cumulants of entries of the matrices for unitarily invariant random matrices and we will in particular look on the correlation functions for products of two independent ensembles of random matrices , one of which is unitarily invariant .",
    "the limit of those formulas if the size @xmath2 of the matrices goes to infinity will be the essence of what we are going to call  higher order freeness \" .",
    "also our main combinatorial objects ,  partitioned permutations \" , will arise very naturally in these calculations .",
    "in section [ sec : multiplicative ] we will forget for a while random variables and just look on the combinatorial essence of our formulas , thus dealing with multiplicative functions on partitioned permutations and their convolution .",
    "the zeta and mbius functions on partitioned permutations will play an important role in these considerations .",
    "in section [ sec : r - transform ] we will derive , for the case of second order , the analogue of the r - transform formulas .",
    "in section [ sec : higher ] we will finally come back to a ( non - commutative ) probabilistic context , give the definition and work out the basic properties of  higher order freeness \" .    in section",
    "[ sec : rmt - iz ] we introduce the notion of  asymptotic higher order freeness \" .",
    "we show that the itzykson - zuber integral encodes all information about higher order freeness .",
    "we also indicate how our techniques can give some insight into the computation of some limits of matrix integrals .    in an appendix ,",
    "section [ sec : surfaced ] , we provide a graphical interpretation of partitioned permutations as a special case of  surfaced permutations \" .",
    "in this section we will first recall in a quite compact form the main connection between voiculescu s free probability theory and questions about random matrices .",
    "then we want to motivate our notion of second order freeness by extending these questions from the level of expectations to the level of fluctuations .",
    "we will recall the relevant results from the papers @xcite and state the main new results of the present paper . even though in the later parts of the paper our treatment will include freeness of arbitrarily high order",
    ", we restrict ourselves in this section mainly to the second order .",
    "the reason for this is that ( apart from first order ) second order freeness seems to be the most important order for applications , so that it seems worthwhile to spell out our general results for this case more explicitly .",
    "furthermore , it is only there that we have an analogue of @xmath0-transform formulas .",
    "we will make a few general remarks about higher order freeness at the end of this section .      assume we know the eigenvalue distribution of two matrices @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "what can we say about the eigenvalue distribution of the sum @xmath5 of the matrices ?",
    "of course , the latter is not just determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath3 and the eigenvalues of @xmath4 , but also by the relation between the eigenspaces of @xmath3 and of @xmath4 .",
    "actually , it is a quite hard problem ( horn s conjecture )  which was only solved recently  to characterize all possible eigenvalue distributions of @xmath5 .",
    "however , if one is asking this question in the context of @xmath6-random matrices , then in many situations the answer becomes deterministic in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a sequence of @xmath6-random matrices .",
    "we say that @xmath3 has a limit eigenvalue distribution if the limit of all moments @xmath9\\qquad ( n\\in { { \\mathbb n } } ) \\ ] ] exists , where @xmath10 denotes the expectation and @xmath11 the normalized trace .    in this language ,",
    "our question becomes : given two random matrix ensembles of @xmath6-random matrices , @xmath8 and @xmath12 , with limit eigenvalue distribution , does also their sum @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , have a limit eigenvalue distribution , and furthermore , can we calculate the limit moments @xmath15 of @xmath16 out of the limit moments @xmath17 of @xmath3 and the limit moments @xmath18 of @xmath4 in a deterministic way .",
    "it turns out that this is the case if the two ensembles are in generic position , and then the rule for calculating the limit moments of @xmath16 are given by voiculescu s concept of  freeness \" .",
    "let us recall this fundamental result of voiculescu .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two random matrix ensembles of @xmath6-random matrices , @xmath8 and @xmath12 , each of them with a limit eigenvalue distribution .",
    "assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent ( i.e. , for each @xmath19 , all entries of @xmath20 are independent from all entries of @xmath21 ) , and that at least one of them is unitarily invariant ( i.e. , for each @xmath2 , the joint distribution of the entries does not change if we conjugate the random matrix with an arbitrary unitary @xmath6 matrix )",
    ". then @xmath3 and @xmath4 are asymptotically free in the sense of the following definition .",
    "[ def : freeness - first ] two random matrix ensembles @xmath8 and @xmath12 with limit eigenvalue distributions are _ asymptotically free _ if we have for all @xmath22 and all @xmath23 , @xmath24 that @xmath25=0\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    one should realize that asymptotic freeness is actually a rule which allows to calculate all mixed moments in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. all expressions @xmath26\\ ] ] out of the limit moments of @xmath3 and the limit moments of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , this means that all limit moments of @xmath5 ( which are sums of mixed moments ) exist , thus @xmath5 has a limit distribution , and are actually determined in terms of the limit moments of @xmath3 and the limit moments of @xmath4 .",
    "the actual calculation rule is not directly clear from the above definition but a basic result of voiculescu shows how this can be achieved by going over from the moments @xmath27 to new quantities @xmath28 . in @xcite , the combinatorial structure behind these @xmath28",
    "was revealed and the name  free cumulants \" was coined for them . whereas in the later parts of this paper we will have to rely crucially on the combinatorial description and their extensions to higher orders , as well as on the definition of more general  mixed \" cumulants , we will here state the results in the simplest possible form in terms of generating power series , which avoids the use of combinatorial objects .    given the moments @xmath29 of some distribution ( or limit moments of some random matrix ensemble ) , we define the corresponding _ free cumulants _ @xmath30 by the following relation between their generating power series : if we put @xmath31 then we require as a relation between these formal power series that @xmath32    voiculescu actually formulated the relation above in a slightly different way using the so - called @xmath0-transform @xmath33 , which is related to @xmath34 by the relation @xmath35 and in terms of the cauchy transform @xmath36 corresponding to a measure with moments @xmath27 , which is related to @xmath37 by @xmath38 in these terms the equation @xmath39 says that @xmath40 i.e. , that @xmath36 and @xmath41 are inverses of each other under composition .",
    "one should also note that the relation @xmath39 determines the moments uniquely in terms of the cumulants and the other way around .",
    "the relevance of the @xmath28 and the @xmath0-transform for our problem comes from the following result of voiculescu , which provides , together with ( [ eq : r - transform - first ] ) , a very efficient way for calculating eigenvalue distributions of the sum of asymptotically free random matrices .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two random matrix ensembles which are asymptotically free .",
    "denote by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 the free cumulants of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "then one has for all @xmath45 that @xmath46 alternatively , @xmath47    this theorem is one reason for calling the @xmath28 cumulants , but there is also another justification for this , namely they are also the limit of classical cumulants of the entries of our random matrix , in the case that this is unitarily invariant .",
    "this description will follow from our formulas and .",
    "we denote the classical cumulants by @xmath48 , considered as multi - linear functionals in @xmath1 arguments .",
    "[ firstlimitcumulant ] let @xmath8 be a unitarily invariant random matrix ensemble of @xmath6 random matrices @xmath20 whose limit eigenvalue distribution exists .",
    "then the free cumulants of this matrix ensemble can also be expressed as the limit of special classical cumulants of the entries of the random matrices : if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 for any choice of distinct @xmath51 .",
    "there are many more refined questions about the limiting eigenvalue distribution of random matrices .",
    "in particular , questions around fluctuations have received a lot of interest in the last decade or so . the main motivation for introducing the concept of ",
    "second order freeness \" was to understand the global fluctuations of the eigenvalues , which means that we look at the probabilistic behavior of traces of powers of our matrices .",
    "the limiting eigenvalue distribution , as considered in the last section , gives us the limit of the average of this traces .",
    "however , one can make more refined statements about their distributions . consider a random matrix @xmath8 and",
    "look on the normalized traces @xmath52 .",
    "our assumption of a limit eigenvalue distribution means that the limits @xmath53 $ ] exist .",
    "it turned out that in many cases the fluctuation around this limit , @xmath54 is asymptotically gaussian of order @xmath55 ; i.e. , the random variable @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 denotes the unnormalized trace ) converges for @xmath7 to a normal variable .",
    "actually , the whole family of centered unnormalized traces @xmath58 converges to a centered gaussian family .",
    "( one should note that we restrict all our considerations to complex random matrices ; in the case of real random matrices there are additional complications , which will be addressed in some future investigations . )",
    "thus the main information about fluctuations of our considered ensemble is contained in the covariance matrix of the limiting gaussian family , i.e. , in the quantities @xmath59 let us emphasize that the @xmath27 and the @xmath60 are actually limits of classical cumulants of traces ; for the first and second order , with expectation as first and variance as second cumulant , this might not be so visible , but it will become evident when we go over to higher orders . nevertheless , the @xmath61 s will behave and will also be treated like moments ; accordingly we will call the @xmath60 ` fluctuation moments ' .",
    "we will later define some other quantities @xmath62 , which take the role of cumulants in this context .",
    "this kind of convergence to a gaussian family was formalized in @xcite as follows .",
    "note that convergence to gaussian means that all higher order classical cumulants converge to zero . as before ,",
    "we denote the classical cumulants by @xmath48 ; so @xmath63 is just the expectation , and @xmath64 the covariance .",
    "let @xmath8 be an ensemble of @xmath6 random matrices @xmath20 .",
    "we say that it has a _ second order limit distribution _ if for all @xmath65 the limits @xmath66 and @xmath67 exist and if @xmath68 for all @xmath69 and all @xmath70 .",
    "we can now ask the same kind of question for the limit fluctuations as for the limit moments ; namely , if we have two random matrix ensembles @xmath3 and @xmath4 and we know the second order limit distribution of @xmath3 and the second order limit distribution of @xmath4 , does this imply that we have a second order limit distribution for @xmath5 , and , if so , is there an effective way for calculating it .",
    "again , we can only hope for a positive solution to this if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in a kind of generic position . as it turned out ,",
    "the same requirements as before are sufficient for this .",
    "the rule for calculating mixed fluctuations constitutes the essence of the definition of the concept of second order freeness .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two random matrix ensembles of @xmath6-random matrices , @xmath8 and @xmath12 , each of them having a second order limit distribution .",
    "assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent and that at least one of them is unitarily invariant .",
    "then @xmath3 and @xmath4 are asymptotically free of second order in the sense of the following definition .",

    ", asymptotic freeness of second order also implies that the sum @xmath5 of our random matrix ensembles has a second order limit distribution and allows one to express them in principle in terms of the second order limit distribution of @xmath3 and the second order limit distribution of @xmath4 . as in the case of first order freeness ,",
    "it is not clear at all how this calculation of the fluctuations of @xmath5 out of the fluctuations of @xmath3 and the fluctuations of @xmath4 can be performed effectively .",
    "it is one of the main results of the present paper to achieve such an effective description .",
    "we are able to solve this problem by providing a second order cumulant machinery , similar to the first order case .",
    "again , the idea is to go over to quantities which behave like cumulants in this setting . the actual description of those relies on combinatorial objects ( annular non - crossing permutations ) ,",
    "but as before this can be reformulated in terms of formal power series .",
    "let us spell out the definition here in this form .",
    "( that this is equivalent to our actual definition of the cumulants will follow from theorem [ second - r ] . )",
    "[ def : cumulants - second ] let @xmath29 and @xmath86 describe the first and second order limit moments of a random matrix ensemble .",
    "we define the corresponding _ first and second order free cumulants _ @xmath30 and @xmath87 by the following requirement in terms of the corresponding generating power series .",
    "put @xmath88 and @xmath89 then we require as relations between these formal power series that @xmath90 and for the second order @xmath91 where @xmath92 or equivalently , @xmath93    as in the first order case , instead of the moment power series @xmath94 one can consider a kind of second order cauchy transform , defined by @xmath95 if we also define a kind of second order @xmath0 transform @xmath96 by @xmath97 then the formula ( [ eq : m - r - motivation ] ) takes on a particularly nice form : @xmath98 @xmath36 is here , as before , the first order cauchy transform , @xmath99 .",
    "the @xmath62 defined above deserve the name  cumulants \" as they linearize the problem of adding random matrices which are asymptotically free of second order .",
    "namely , as will follow from our theorem [ thm : additivity - of - cumulants ] , we have the following theorem , which provides , together with ( [ eq : g - r - motivation ] ) , an effective machinery for calculating the fluctuations of the sum of asymptotically free random matrices .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two random matrix ensembles which are asymptotically free .",
    "then one has for all @xmath65 that @xmath100 alternatively , @xmath101 and @xmath102    again , one can express the second order cumulants as limits of classical cumulants of entries of a unitarily invariant matrix .",
    "in contrast to the first order case , we have now to run over two disjoint cycles in the indices of the matrix entries . this theorem will follow from our formulas and .",
    "[ secondlimitcumulant ] let @xmath8 be a unitarily invariant random matrix ensemble which has a second order limit distribution .",
    "then the second order free cumulants of this matrix ensemble can also be expressed as the limit of classical cumulants of the entries of the random matrices : if @xmath49 , then @xmath103 for any choice of distinct @xmath104 .",
    "this latter theorem makes it quite obvious that the second order cumulants for gaussian as well as for wishart matrices vanish identically , i.e. , @xmath105 and thus we obtain in these cases that the second order cauchy transform is totally determined in terms of the first order cauchy transform ( i.e. , in terms of the limiting eigenvalue distribution ) via @xmath106 this formula for fluctuations of wishart matrices was also derived by bai and silverstein in @xcite .",
    "the idea for higher order freeness is the same as for second order one . for a random matrix ensemble @xmath8",
    "we define @xmath107-th order limit moments as the scaled limit of classical cumulants of @xmath107 traces of powers of our matrices , @xmath108 ( the choice of @xmath109 is motivated by the fact that this is the leading order for many interesting random matrix ensembles , e.g. gaussian or wishart .",
    "thus our theory of higher order freeness captures the features of random matrix ensembles whose cumulants of traces decay in the same way as for gaussian random matrices .",
    ") then we look at two random matrix ensembles @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are independent , and one of them unitarily invariant .",
    "the mixed moments in @xmath3 and @xmath4 of order @xmath107 are , in leading order in the limit @xmath7 , determined by the limit moments of @xmath3 up to order @xmath107 and the limit moments of @xmath4 up to order @xmath107 .",
    "the structure of these formulas motivates directly the definition of cumulants of the considered order .",
    "the definition of those is in terms of a moment - cumulant formula , which gives a moment in terms of cumulants by summing over special combinatorial objects , which we call  partitioned permutations \" .",
    "most of the theory we develop relies on an in depth analysis of properties of these partitioned permutations and the corresponding convolution of multiplicative functions on partitioned permutations . our definition of  higher order freeness \"",
    "is then in terms of the vanishing of mixed cumulants .",
    "it follows quite easily that in the first and second order case this gives the same as the relations in definitions [ def : freeness - first ] and [ def : freeness - second ] , respectively . for higher orders , however , we are not able to find an explicit relation of that type .",
    "this reflects somehow the observation that our general formulas in terms of sums over partitioned permutations are the same for all orders , but that evaluating or simplifying these sums ( by doing partial summations ) is beyond our abilities for orders greater than 2 .",
    "reformulating the combinatorial relation between moments and cumulants in terms of generating power series is one prominent example for this .",
    "whereas this is quite easy for first order , the complexity of the arguments and the solution ( given in definition [ def : cumulants - second ] ) is much higher for second order , and out of reach for higher order .    one should note that an effective ( analytic or symbolic ) calculation of higher order moments of a sum @xmath5 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 free of higher order relies usually on the presence of such generating power series formulas . in this sense , we have succeeded in providing an effective machinery for dealing with fluctuations ( second order ) , but we were not able to do so for higher order .",
    "our results for higher orders are more of a theoretical nature .",
    "one of the main problems we have to address there is the associativity of the notion of higher order freeness .",
    "namely , in order to be an interesting concept , our definition that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are free of higher order should of course imply that any function of @xmath3 is also free of higher order from any function of @xmath4 .",
    "whereas for first and second order this follows quite easily from the equivalent characterization of freeness in terms of moments as in definitions [ def : freeness - first ] and [ def : freeness - second ] , the absence of such a characterization for higher orders makes this a more complicated matter .",
    "namely , what we have to see is that the vanishing of mixed cumulants in random variables implies also the vanishing of mixed cumulants in elements from the generated algebras .",

    "this expansion extends results of @xcite .",
    "it is more general than that obtained in @xcite , because it also handles the case when @xmath1166 has asymptotic fluctuations .",
    "however , unlike in @xcite , the convergence that we obtain is formal and it would be very interesting to check if it still holds at an analytic level .",
    "in this appendix we will present a more geometrical view on partitioned permutations . as we shall see in the following ,",
    "partitioned permutations are just special cases of  surfaced permutations \" ; in particular the results of this article can be equivalently formulated in the language of surfaced permutations . on the other hand , for the purpose of this article we do not need anything more than just partitioned permutations and the reader not interested in surfaced permutations may skip this section without much harm .",
    "our goal is to study factorizations of permutations , i.e.  solutions @xmath1167 of the equation @xmath1168 where @xmath1169 is some fixed permutation and @xmath1170 are subject to some additional constraints , depending on a particular context .",
    "typically , one of these constrains concerns @xmath1171 , the other one concerns the orbits of the action of @xmath1172 .",
    "it would be very useful to equip permutations @xmath1172 with some additional structure in such a way that the product @xmath1173 of the resulting enriched permutations @xmath1174 would carry both the information about the product @xmath1175 of permutations and the information about @xmath1171 .",
    "as we shall see in the following , surfaced permutations provide an appropriate tool .",
    "we say that @xmath1177 is a _ surfaced permutation _ of some finite set @xmath3 if @xmath1178 is a two  dimensional surface with a fixed orientation and with a boundary @xmath1179 and if @xmath1180 is a injection",
    ". we can think about the information carried by @xmath1181 as follows : some of the points on the boundary @xmath1179 are distinguished and carry different labels from the set @xmath3 .",
    "we also require that every connected component of @xmath1182 carries at least one distinguished point .",
    "an example of a surfaced permutation is presented on figure [ fig : young1 ] .",
    "we identify surfaced permutations @xmath1183 , @xmath1184 of the same set @xmath3 if there exists a orientation preserving homeomorphism @xmath1185 such that @xmath1186 .",
    "the set of surfaced permutations of set @xmath1187 will be denoted by @xmath1188 .",
    "let @xmath1189 ; the boundary @xmath1179 with the inherited orientation from @xmath1178 is just a collection of oriented circles with some distinguished points labeled @xmath1022 marked on them .",
    "in this way we can define a permutation @xmath1190 , called the support of @xmath1191 , the cycles of which correspond to connected components of @xmath1179 , as it can be seen on figure [ fig : young1 ] .",
    "it is therefore a good idea to think that a surfaced permutation is just a ( usual ) permutation @xmath1192 equipped with some additional information carried by the surface @xmath1178",
    ".    a surfaced permutation @xmath1189 can be uniquely specified ( up to the equivalence relation ) by its support @xmath1190 and by specifying the shape of the connected components of @xmath1178 .",
    "the latter information is given by an equivalence relation on cycles of @xmath251 ( each class corresponds to a connected component of @xmath1178 ) and furthermore for each class of this relation we should specify the genus of the corresponding connected component of @xmath1178 . above it should be understood that the genus of a surface @xmath1178 with a boundary is by definition equal to the genus of a surface @xmath1193 without boundary obtained from @xmath1178 by gluing a disc to every connected component of @xmath1179 ; for example both a disc and the lateral surface of a cylinder have genus zero .      among surfaced permutations a special class will be very important for our purposes , namely surfaced permutations @xmath1191 such that each connected component of @xmath1178 has genus zero .",
    "it is easy to see that there is a bijection between such surfaced permutations @xmath1191 and partitioned permutations @xmath1194 given as follows : @xmath251 is the support of @xmath1191 and @xmath152 is the partition given by connected components of @xmath1178 .",
    "let surfaced permutations @xmath1195 be given .",
    "on the boundary of @xmath755 there are marked points labeled by numbers @xmath1022 ; let us split every marked point @xmath138 into a consecutive pair of points @xmath138 and @xmath1196 , as it is presented on the example from figure [ fig : split ] . in the second step , for each @xmath1197 we glue a small neighborhood of the vertex @xmath1198 to a small neighborhood of the vertex @xmath1199 in such a way that the orientations of @xmath756 and @xmath755 coincide . in this way",
    "we obtain a new surface @xmath1178 which has marked points on its boundary @xmath1179 and these are exactly the vertices from @xmath1200 labeled @xmath1022 ; we denote the resulting surfaced permutation by @xmath1191 and we call it a product @xmath1201 of the original surfaced permutations .",
    "this choice of gluing surfaces @xmath756 and @xmath755 implies that the support of @xmath1201 is equal to the product of the support of @xmath1183 and the support of @xmath1184 .",
    "it is not difficult to explain now the definition of the product of partitioned permutations ( definition [ def : mult ] ) : we treat partitioned permutations as surfaced permutations and compute their product ; if the genus of the resulting surface is zero we can identify it with another partitioned permutation , otherwise we set the product to be zero .",
