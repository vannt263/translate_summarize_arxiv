    "amongst the various effects of strong interactions in electronic systems , the possibility of crystallization of electrons , initially predicted by wigner @xcite , is one of the most exciting . for densities lower than a critical density @xmath4 , the coulomb potential energy dominates over the kinetic energy and one expects the formation of a wigner crystal ( wc ) , where the electrons occupy the sites of a lattice ( triangular in two dimensions ) .",
    "a measure of this critical density is the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 defined as the ratio of the coulomb to fermi energies .",
    "unfortunately , crystallization requires extremely low densities which are hard to obtain for three dimensional systems .",
    "the situation is much better for a two dimensional electron gas where monte - carlo simulations @xcite have shown that the formation of a wc requires a density corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "first , it is easier to access such densities and second , the value of @xmath4 can be increased by the application of a strong magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2deg .",
    "two dimensional electron gases under strong magnetic fields are thus the prime candidate systems in which to observe the phenomenon of wigner crystallization .    indeed an insulating state was observed in experiments on monolayer systems @xcite .",
    "this insulating state was characterized by a diverging diagonal resistivity @xmath7 for temperature @xmath8 and activated behavior for finite @xmath9 . moreover",
    ", the hall resistivity @xmath10 was found to be temperature independent and nearly equal to its classical value .",
    "for the pure systems , approximate calculations @xcite have shown that the wc becomes the lowest energy state when the filling factor @xmath11 which is the ratio of the density to the magnetic field equals @xmath12 for ga - as electron systems and around @xmath13 for the hole like systems .",
    "so it is quite reasonable to interpret the insulating state as a wigner crystal pinned by the incipient disorder in the sample .",
    "this is consistent with the diverging linear resistivity and with measurements of nonlinear @xmath14 characteristics .",
    "nonetheless , given the absence of direct imaging of the system , the unambiguous identification of this phase as a wc was the subject of intense debate .",
    "also , the theoretical analysis was complicated by various important factors compared to the simple case proposed by wigner : ( i ) in these systems in strong magnetic fields , the phase diagram is very rich , since the interplay of interaction and disorder can lead to phases such as the integer and fractional quantum hall effect . the non - crystalline phase is not a free electron gas but a strongly correlated phase .",
    "it is therefore , not obvious that one does not need a description anchored in the quantum hall physics to describe the insulating phase as well @xcite ; ( ii ) disorder modifies drastically the physical properties of crystalline phases .",
    "this makes the determination of the transport properties which is our only probe of the wc crystal so far , much more difficult to compute .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the question of how to describe such pinned crystalline phases is still open .",
    "our understanding of the effect of disorder on such elastic structures stemmed from the pioneering works of larkin @xcite for vortices and fukuyama and lee ( fl)@xcite for charge density waves , which predict that the crystal gets pinned by disorder and perfect translational order is lost . as a result of the pinning , the a.c .",
    "transport develops a peak at a disorder dependent pinning frequency @xmath15 .",
    "however , due to the qualitative nature of these theories , very little was known beyond these qualitative aspects of a pinned system .",
    "this is a tremendous handicap for the wc since , contrarily to cdw , the problem of a wc involves many length scales .",
    "moreover , the loss of translational order and the possibility of defects led to doubts about the validity of an elastic theory to study the transport .",
    "recent experiments@xcite have started to obtain the full frequency dependent conductivity , and the magnetic field and density dependence of observables such as the pinning frequency .",
    "the fact that these experiments did not comply with simple fl type expectations , cast doubts on the interpretation of this experimental phase as a pinned wc .",
    "this clamors for a quantitative theory of pinned wc that goes beyond the fl approximations , and with which experiments can be compared to .    fortunately , the recent progress made in the understanding of such disordered elastic structures @xcite presents us with methods , which go beyond simple scaling level arguments , to tackle periodic systems with disorder .",
    "these techniques were used to show @xcite that despite pinning , a classical three dimensional periodic system is defect free and retains quasi long range translational order ( bragg glass ) . in this paper",
    ", we use these methods to obtain a _ quantitative _ theory of the pinned wc .",
    "we show that an elastic description is an excellent approximation .",
    "we compute both the static and the a.c .",
    "transport properties and investigate in detail the magnetic field dependence of the various relevant quantities , such as the pinning frequency and threshold field .",
    "we show that the behavior of a pinned wc has marked differences from the one that was commonly accepted , based on the analogies with pinned charge density waves .",
    "our theory permits a reasonably consistent description of the existing experimental results , and suggests additional ways to check for a pinned wc through the transport properties .",
    "a summary of the method and some of the results on the a.c .",
    "transport were presented in a shorter form in ref .  .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "let us define the model we use to study the insulating crystal phase .",
    "firstly , we see that retaining the full fermionic nature of the wavefunction , would lead to a very complicated problem in the presence of disorder and coulomb interactions .",
    "fortunately , in the crystal phase the particles become localized , and thus distinguishable .",
    "so a `` classical '' description for the crystal is a good starting point .",
    "the quantum aspects of the original fermionic problem will be hidden in the parameters characterizing this crystal . in the crystalline phase ,",
    "the electrons occupy the sites of a triangular lattice with a lattice constant @xmath16 which is related to the density of electrons by @xmath17 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : basiclength ] , the electrons at site @xmath18 are displaced from their mean equilibrium positions labeled by the two dimensional vector @xmath19 , by @xmath20 . the `` effective '' size of the particles in this crystal are determined by the spatial extension of the electronic wavefunction , as shown in figure  [ fig : basiclength ] . in the presence of a strong magnetic field",
    ", this is simply the cyclotron radius @xmath21 . at finite temperatures , thermal fluctuations",
    "add to this purely quantum extension of the wavefunction .",
    "hence the `` size '' of the particle gets renormalized . for high temperatures",
    ", it tends to the lindemann length @xmath22 , defined by the average thermal displacement @xmath23 .",
    "a rough estimate of the size of the particle is thus @xmath24 . in the following",
    ", we will simply denote this ( temperature dependent ) length by @xmath25 . note that this kind of classical approach is certainly valid for strong magnetic fields where , @xmath26 . in this case , the overlap of the various electronic wavefunctions is negligible and the fermi statistics can be safely ignored .",
    "it is rather difficult to give a precise estimate of the field and density for which this approach breaks down . a useful hint is nonetheless given by the lindemann criterion for the melting of a classical crystal @xmath27 , where the lindemann number @xmath28 .",
    "this shows that even displacements close to melting remain relatively small .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect that our approach would remain valid even relatively close to melting .",
    "our approach also applies to wigner crystal at @xmath29 , provided the correct extension of the wavefunction is used in place of @xmath25 .",
    "the three length characterizing the wigner crystal .",
    "the size @xmath25 of the `` particles '' in the crystal ( at low temperature it is essentially given by the extension of the wavefunction around the equilibrium position and is the cyclotron radius , at large temperatures it is controlled by the thermal fluctuations and is the lindemann length ) , @xmath16 the lattice spacing is controlled by the density of particles , and the disorder is correlated over a length @xmath30 .",
    "the inset shows the triangular structure of the wigner crystal .",
    "particles are labeled by an equilibrium position @xmath31 and a displacement @xmath32 . ]",
    "the long wavelength properties of the wc can now be described by an elastic hamiltonian describing the displacements @xmath33 .",
    "we set @xmath34 in the rest of the paper .",
    "the vibration modes of this crystal can be quantized in the usual manner leading to the imaginary time elastic action in the presence of disorder , @xmath35 u_{\\beta}(-q,-\\omega_n ) \\\\ & & +   \\int d^{2}r \\int_0^{\\beta } d\\tau v ( { r})\\rho ( { r},\\tau ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where here and below we denote the integration over the brillouin zone ( bz ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 are the two components of the vector @xmath33 , @xmath39 is the antisymmetric tensor @xmath40 and the matsubara frequencies @xmath41 with the inverse temperature @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 are the mass and charge densities . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the shear and bulk moduli",
    ". these moduli can be obtained from an expansion of the coulomb correlation energy of the wc in terms of the displacements .",
    "analytical expressions for the elastic moduli were obtained for the classical crystal in ref .  .",
    "later , efforts were made to estimate quantum corrections to these moduli using trial wave functions@xcite .",
    "here , we work with the classical values obtained in ref .   where the elastic moduli are independent of the magnetic field , which should be a reasonable approximation for strong fields .",
    "the bulk modulus @xmath45 and the shear modulus @xmath44 are given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the dielectric constant of the substrate .",
    "since the bulk modulus describes compressional modes , it is drastically affected by the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the off - diagonal term in the action ( [ eq : ham ] ) comes from the lorentz force , and is proportional to the cyclotron frequency @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane of the crystal .",
    "finally , the last term describes the coupling to disorder , modeled here by a random potential @xmath51 . the density of particles @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a @xmath54-like function of range @xmath25 ( see figure  [ fig : basiclength ] ) and @xmath55 .",
    "since the disorder can vary at a lengthscale @xmath30 _ a priori _ shorter or comparable to the lattice spacing @xmath16 , the continuum limit @xmath56 , valid in the elastic limit @xmath57 should be taken with care in the disorder term @xcite .",
    "this can be done using the decomposition of the density in terms of its fourier components @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the average density and @xmath60 are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the perfect crystal .",
    "the finite range of @xmath53 is recovered@xcite by restricting the sum over @xmath61 to momentum of order @xmath62 we assume a gaussian distribution for the disorder @xmath63 , which leads to the following disorder averages @xmath64 @xmath65 is a delta - like function of range @xmath30 which is the characteristic correlation length of the disorder potential ( see figure  [ fig : basiclength ] ) .",
    "the gaussian limit is valid when there are many weak pins .",
    "we will come back to this point in a more quantitative manner in the next section .",
    "the physical properties of the various phases of the two dimensional electron crystal are completely governed by the interplay of the the various microscopic length scales in the system : the lattice spacing @xmath16 , the particle size @xmath66 and the disorder correlation length @xmath67 .",
    "these microscopic parameters define collective lengthscales which are of fundamental importance in the physics of such disordered systems @xcite .",
    "these length scales , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are the distances over which the relative displacements are of the order of the size of the particle and the lattice spacing respectively .",
    "they are defined by the disorder averaged displacement correlation functions @xmath70",

    "\\langle [ { u } ( { r}_a ) - { u } ( { 0})]^2\\rangle & = & a^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to distinguish between these two lengths it is mandatory to keep all the harmonics in the decomposition of the density ( [ eq : fourdens ] ) . keeping only one harmonic , as is done for cdw ,",
    "amounts to considering that the effective `` size '' of the particle is @xmath16 and hence @xmath71 . for the wigner crystal , as we will see , it is crucial to carefully distinguish between these two lengthscales .",
    "the length @xmath69 can easily be obtained by a static scaling argument comparing the cost in shear elastic energy and the gain due to disorder . for the wc , where @xmath72 we get @xmath73 in order to be in the weak pinning regime , and for an elastic description to be valid , it is necessary to have @xmath74 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath68 , the so called larkin - ovchinikov length@xcite is more subtle .",
    "it corresponds to lengths where the particles can truly feel the random potential . in particular , it is the length above which the larkin model @xcite , which approximates the random potential by a random force becomes invalid , and pinning and metastability appear . if @xmath75 , the system is collectively pinned , whereas one would have single particle pinning in the opposite case .",
    "we emphasize that the elastic approximation is valid regardless of the behavior of @xmath68 , provided one still has @xmath74 .    since @xmath76 , @xmath69 has in the past been incorrectly interpreted as the lengthscale at which topological defects such as dislocations appear and the translational order of the crystal is lost .",
    "the naive picture is the one of a crystal broken into crystallites of size @xmath69 .",
    "it has recently been shown that this view is grossly incorrect .",
    "in particular , even in two dimension topological defects appear at a lengthscale @xmath77 much greater than @xmath69 , and the crystal preserves a very good degree of positional order @xcite . in three dimensions , the situation is even more favorable since the system preserves a quasi translational order ( power - law divergent bragg peaks ) and topological defects are not generated by weak disorder ( @xmath78 ) . the physical implications of these results for the present problem will be discussed in section  [ sec : limitations ] .",
    "we now study the disordered wc described by ( [ eq : ham ] ) . due to the nonlinear coupling of the disorder to the displacement field @xmath33 in ( [ eq : ham ] ) , this problem is extremely difficult to solve . here , we treat it using a variational method @xcite . many of the technical details and subtleties of the method can be found in the literature ( see e.g. ref .   for a review ) .",
    "we focus directly on the wc and we present here only the main steps . the first step involves averaging ( [ eq : ham ] ) over disorder by introducing replicas",
    ". this averaging results in an effective action which involves interactions between the @xmath3 replicas , given by    @xmath79 u^a_\\gamma(-q,-\\omega_n )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{\\rho_0 ^ 2}{2 } \\int d^2r \\int_0^{\\beta } \\int_0^{\\beta   } d\\tau d\\tau ' \\sum_{a , b , { k } } \\delta_k \\cos\\left[k\\cdot\\left(u^a ( { r},\\tau ) - u^b ( { r},\\tau')\\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where summations over @xmath80 and @xmath81 are implicit .",

    "( [ eq : seff ] ) is quite general and can be used to describe a host of physical systems , both quantum and classical @xcite .",
    "the disorder couples the various replicas via the cosine term .",
    "though this cosine term is local in space , it is completely non - local in time .",
    "this non - locality leads to a rich dynamical behavior as we shall show in this paper .",
    "in addition to the cosine term , another quadratic term is generated by the @xmath91 part of the disorder .",
    "this can be absorbed in a shift of the displacement field @xmath33 .",
    "it affects the static correlation functions but not the transport properties and thus we neglect it henceforth .",

    "[ sec : elasticmodel ] , the quantum nature of the original particle can be safely hidden in the parameters of the crystal hamiltonian , as long as the spatial extent of the particles remain small compared to the lattice spacing .",
    "one expects this to be valid even quite close to the melting transition of the wc . of course",
    ", our approach does not allow for a very precise description of the melting properties , beyond the simple position of the transition , since this simplified description is incapable of taking into account the fermionic statistics and the incompressible quantum fluid that is the melted `` crystal '' .",
    "an a priori limitation of our study , even in the insulating phase far from melting , is to know whether the elastic model is a satisfactory starting point to obtain the transport properties or whether defects ( vacancies , interstitials , dislocations etc ) should be taken into account from the start . indeed",
    "if dislocations appear at a typical lengthscale @xmath77 they will strongly modify the results given by the elastic description for frequencies smaller than a characteristic frequency @xmath261 .",
    "older theories of disordered elastic systems suggest that due to the presence of disorder , defects are favored at the length @xmath69 for which displacements would become of order of the lattice spacing ( see section  [ sec : lengthscales ] ) .",

    "our theory also predicts a non lorentzian shape for the peaks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcond ] , a feature that is clearly exhibited by the data @xcite .",
    "however several features seen in these experiments are still extremely puzzling , and in fact incompatible , to the best of our knowledge , with all existing theories .",
    "some anomalous features are the saturation of the pinning frequency and the increase of spectral weight in the pinning peak when the magnetic field in increased . within a wc approach ,",
    "if one in addition assumes field independent elastic constants , one always expects a reduction of the spectral weight contained in the pinning peak due to the continuous transfer of spectral weight from the pinning peak at low frequencies to the cyclotron peak . on the other hand , it is crucial to note that the interpretation of the experimental data is complicated by the following facts : ( i ) the experiment is performed at a quite high temperature @xmath278 which is comparable with the pinning frequency of @xmath279 . therefore , thermal contributions to the broadening of the peaks might have to be taken in .",
    "( ii ) the filling factors considered are quite high .",
    "it is thus plausible that most of the data lies outside the range of validity of a putative wc",
    ". it would thus be extremely useful , to have more detailed experiments performed in a lower range of temperatures and at lower filling fractions .",
    "( iii ) since the experiment is performed at relatively large filling factors , the very hypothesis of field independent elastic constants , which is valid at large fields , is questionable .",
    "one would have to know the true dependence of the elastic constants on the magnetic field , to make a reliable comparison even within the framework of a pinned wc theory .",
    "another series of experiments @xcite focused on the density dependence of the pinning peak .",
    "this set of experiments were done at lower temperatures @xmath280 and lower filling fractions , so this data is much more likely to be in a regime of a wc .",
    "since these experiments are at fixed magnetic field , they partially avoid the above mentioned problem with the elastic constants .",
    "they should thus provide for a more clear cut interpretation .",
    "a decrease of the pinning frequency with increasing density was observed , fitting reasonably well with either a @xmath257 or a @xmath256 behavior , depending on the sample .",
    "a comparison of these results was made with the fl theory for cdw .",
    "within this theory _ and for a cdw _ , the pinning frequency varies as @xmath256 . a blind application of this result to",
    "the wc led ref .   to conclude that there was good agreement between the theory and the experimental findings . but",
    "as shown in appendix  [ ap : cdwvswc ] , the correct extension of the fl theory to the wc case , leads in fact to an _ increase _ of the pining frequency to density as @xmath281 .",
    "this is due to the fact that refs .",
    "deals with charge density waves where the equivalent of the displacement field @xmath33 is the phase which is dimensionless . reinstating the correct factor @xmath16 which is the unit of displacement gives an extra factor of the density @xmath260 .",
    "the fact that a naive extrapolation of the fl theory is not possible for pinned wc is again clearly demonstrated by the experiment .",
    "the correct behavior ( [ eq : wpdens ] ) is @xmath257 .",
    "so our theory is perfectly compatible with the experimental data .",
    "in addition , other features such as the non - lorentzian shape of the peaks , are also clearly visible in the data . in this experiment ,",
    "the peak height decreases and peak width increases as the pinning frequency increases .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with our predictions for the pinned wc , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : density ] .",
    "compare , for example the qualitative lineshape of fig .",
    "[ fig : bcond ] with the data in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "thus the agreement of these experiments with our theory strongly supports the interpretation of the observed phase as a pinned wc .",
    "furthermore , our results suggests other possible experiments to check for further experimental signatures of the wc . the middle frequency range ( i.e. @xmath282 ) could be compared with the theoretical formula ( [ cxx1 ] ) .",
    "working at frequencies above the pinning peak has two advantages : ( i ) the system is more free from thermal fluctuations , since frequency becomes the dominant energy scale ; ( ii ) as explained in sec .  [",
    "sec : limitations ] the effects of the topological defects are totally unimportant , so one expects our variational results to be a very good description of this regime .",
    "another useful probe of the existence of the crystal , is given by difference in behavior of the conductivity as a function of the both the density and the magnetic field .",
    "in the liquid phase , all quantities are functions of the filling fraction @xmath283 , but do not depend separately on these two quantities .",
    "the striking difference between the @xmath3 and @xmath50 dependence seen in experiment is thus another strong indication of the presence of the crystal . it would thus be interesting to systematically investigate whether a scaling in @xmath284 is obeyed or not .",
    "such a scaling could then signal the melting of the crystal .",
    "let us now compare our work with other theoretical work on the conductivity of the wigner crystal .    as already mentioned in the previous sections , our work and the pioneering work of fl for the pinning of cdw share the same starting point .",
    "however , it differs from the fl - type analysis in the following essential ways : ( i ) the gvm permits a complete and consistent calculation of the dynamical conductivity .",
    "this allows for a precise calculation of the pinning frequency and the disorder induced dissipation ( see sec .  [ sec : summary ] ) ; ( ii ) the gvm bypasses the problem of the unknown fitting parameter that occurs in the self consistent born approximation @xcite , and thus provides an unambiguous determination of the conductivity .",
    "the gvm allows for a proper description of the inherent glassy aspects of the system , and in particular , of the metastable states ; ( iii ) more importantly , to treat correctly the case of the pinned wc , it is necessary , contrarily to the cdw case , to retain variations of disorder at lengthscales smaller than the particle size .",
    "this point was overlooked in more recent applications of the fl theory to the case of the pinned wc @xcite .",
    "as has been extensively discussed in the preceding sections , this leads to radically different dependence of the pinning frequency on the magnetic field and density .",
    "the question of the linewidth of the pinning peak in conductivity was also addressed in two series of works .",
    "map the the crystal onto an effective bosonic model . within a mean field approach",
    ", they obtained exponentially narrow widths of the pinning peak . since the computed width is much narrower than observed , extraneous modes of broadening need to be invoked to explain the experimental results . in ref .",
    ", an expression for @xmath285 was obtained in the limit of pinning frequencies much smaller than the cyclotron frequency . from the conductivity expression a formula , linking the half width of the peaks with the low frequency part of the conductivity was obtained giving @xmath286 , where @xmath216 is the exponent governing the low frequency part of the conductivity . using a quite different method , the authors of ref .",
    "unknowingly rederived formulas for the conductivity ( their formulas ( 62 ) and ( 68 ) and the associated energy scales ) that are identical the ones obtained by us via the gvm in ref .  .",
    "not surprisingly , ref .",
    "find the same energy scales .",
    "the only difference is the dissipation function @xmath147 which is replaced in ref .   by an arbitrary dissipation function ( denoted @xmath287 and taken to be purely imaginary ) scaling for low frequencies as @xmath288 . in our case",
    "the gvm completely fixes the function @xmath147 ( with both a real and imaginary part ) which scales as @xmath289 , thus fixing @xmath290 . in ref .",
    ", though the exponent @xmath216 could not be computed , arguments were given that the value should be @xmath291 , leading to much more narrow peaks than those stemming from the gvm .",
    "although , it is in principle possible for the gvm to miss a part of the excitations ( see e.g. the discussion in ref .  )",
    "we argue that for the pinned wc the exponent @xmath290 is correct for the following reasons : ( i ) while it is conceivable for the gvm to miss part of the excitations ( such as solitons ) this oversight should lead to an _ underestimate _ of the low frequency part of the conductivity , while an exponent @xmath292 would imply that the gvm overestimates the conductivity ; ( ii ) in @xmath293 , the exponent @xmath290 given by the gvm , is exactly the one needed to reproduce the correct behavior of the conductivity which can also be determined exactly @xcite .",
    "in addition the parameter @xmath292 leads to peak widths that are much smaller than the ones that are observed experimentally .",
    "perhaps the difference between our results and the approach followed in ref .   to estimate @xmath216 , can be traced to the fact that ref",
    ".   uses essentially a classical approximation for the wc .",
    "the @xmath294 on the other hand depends on @xmath139 so is a quantum effect and will vanish if all quantum effects are thrown away .",
    "in addition to these approaches based on an elastic description of the system , ref .   incorporated a different approach based on the microscopic model of an electron gas confined to its lowest landau level . though they find that the pinning frequency increases with the field , they can not account for the sharp increase in peak amplitudes nor do they obtain the correct dispersion of the collective modes .",
    "the authors suggest the interesting possibility that electronic single particle excitations might in some indirect way be responsible for the experimentally seen behavior .",
    "further work is required before unambiguous theoretical conclusions can be drawn .",
    "we have presented in this paper a quantitative theory of the pinned wigner crystal .",
    "we computed static and a.c .",
    "transport properties .",
    "we have obtained the complete frequency dependence of the imaginary and real parts of the conductivity tensor .",
    "we have shown that the a.c .",
    "transport properties and in particular , the features of the pinning peak , can be reliably extracted from an elastic theory , without having to take into account topological defects of the pinned wc . we have studied the evolution of various dynamical quantities such as the pinning frequency when the magnetic field and density are varied .",
    "we have shown that this problem is controlled by quite different lengthscales as compared to the standard pinned cdw problem .",
    "more specifically , depending on the strength of the magnetic field , the pinning frequency can exhibit quite different behaviors as a function of magnetic field .",
    "our theory presents a consistent explanation of most of the observed experimental features , particularly the recent experiments @xcite and thus provides a strong support for the interpretation of the high field phase observed in the 2deg as a pinned wigner crystal .",
    "note that the deviations in the hall coefficient @xcite observed in the pinned phase , are consistent with the predictions of a transverse critical force @xcite that should exist for a pinned periodic structure , again in agreement with the interpretation of this phase as a pinned wigner crystal .",
    "conductivity and threshold measurements on the zero - field wc phase seen in ga - as samples , as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath3 should provide an ideal testing ground for our theory .",
    "also a better understanding of the disorder present in these samples is required before a realistic comparison with theoretical models can be made .",
    "our work prompts several questions and issues that still need to be analyzed .",
    "an important issue is of course the influence of the anomalous ( fractional quantum hall ) liquid phase .",
    "as we have argued this should have little influence deep in the crystal phase , but certainly changes the melting or the properties close to melting in a way that still remains to be understood .",
    "this might be a reason for the strange behavior observed at intermediate magnetic fields .",
    "the way the disorder or the elastic moduli could be affected by the magnetic field in this region also demands attention .",
    "but the most important question is the effect of topological defects at finite temperature .",
    "as we have shown , they are not important for the a.c . transport .",
    "but most likely they will be central in understanding the d.c . transport .",
    "it is not known whether the dc resistivity has any anomalous temperature dependence like those seen in experiments where @xmath295 where @xmath11 is an exponent which is close to @xmath296 in si mosfets and is found to vary with density in the experiments on the zero field gaas samples .",
    "other interesting questions concern the scaling with temperature and electric field seen in the data .",
    "can such a scaling be accommodated within the pinned wc approach ?",
    "we leave these directions for future work .",
    "we would like to acknowledge many interesting discussions with h. a. fertig , m.m .",

    "now simplifies to @xmath323 thus all off - diagonal replica coupling , and in particular the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) is confined entirely to the @xmath324 mode . for the present problem",
