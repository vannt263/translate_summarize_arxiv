    ", which are known as systematic errors to distinguish them from random noise errors due to decoherence .",
    "composite pulse sequences found further applications as a robust and versatile tool to tackle these and other systematic errors @xcite .",
    "composite pulse technique replaces a single pulse conventionally used to drive a two - state quantum transition by a finite train of pulses with well - defined relative phases .",
    "the phases are used as a control tool and can be determined such as to cancel out a systematic error inherent in the single pulse rotations .",
    "thus the propagator of the system can be shaped in a desired manner to create a robust unitary operation , an objective which is impossible with a single pulse or adiabatic techniques .",
    "such composite approach to quantum evolution was first employed in polarization optics in the design of achromatic ( broadband ) polarization retarders where several wave plates are rotated at specific angles with respect to the fast polarization axis @xcite .",
    "some thirty years later , the composite pulse approach was developed in nmr for design of composite pulse sequences .",
    "the first composite pulse sequence for use in nmr was proposed by levitt and freeman @xcite to compensate for fluctuations in the radiofrequency driving strength .",
    "this type of sequence which realizes a transition probability nearly constant over a wide range of pulse area variations around @xmath3 is called a broadband ( bb ) composite pulse .",
    "the longer the composite sequences , the flatter and broader bb excitation profiles are obtained .",
    "alternatively , a narrow excitation profile around pulse area @xmath3 is produced by narrowband ( nb ) composite pulse sequences @xcite .",
    "such nb pulses enable enhanced selectivity of excitation and make possible the selective addressing of an atomic qubit in a string of closely spaced qubits with a laser beam which is not tightly focused on the addressed qubit alone , but residual light may irradiate the adjacent qubits @xcite .",
    "passband ( pb ) sequences exhibit both narrowband and passband behavior simultaneously and possess a nearly rectangular excitation profile as a function of the pulse area .",
    "they act as error correcting composite pulses for moderate deviations @xmath6 of the pulse area from @xmath3 and also as relatively robust identity operators for pulse areas near 0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this makes them an ideal tool for background suppression of unwanted signal in nmr experiments as was recently demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite where improved intensity in the desired signal was achieved while still maintaining good suppression of unwanted background signal .",
    "such pulses are of significant interest also for trapped ions or ultracold atoms in optical lattices for pb pulses ensure both robust manipulation and local qubit addressing .    in this paper , we present an analytical recipe for deriving arbitrarily accurate completely compensating resonant composite pulses against pulse amplitude noise .",
    "the pulse design which we present in this paper is based on concatenation of broadband @xmath0 and narrowband @xmath1 pulse sequences , composed of @xmath7 and @xmath8 pulses respectively , both of which are defined by analytical formulas for arbitrary odd number of pulses . in this manner , we can create arbitrarily large and arbitrarily accurate pb sequences of @xmath9 pulses , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 both odd numbers .",

    "for example , a variation @xmath6 from the desired value for the pulse area results in an error in the population inversion of the order @xmath33 .",
