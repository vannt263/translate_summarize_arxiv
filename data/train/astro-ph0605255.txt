    "different types of observations have been made for the purpose of determining the primordial elemental abundances .",
    "these observational results provide rich information about the cosmic chemical evolution of the light nuclear species .",
    "today bbn provides a very precise tool for inferring the condition of the early universe .",
    "bbn in the standard cosmology explains relatively well the inferred primordial abundances for a narrow range of the universal baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite has measured the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and parameters characterizing the standard big bang cosmology have been deduced  @xcite from these data . for the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath8 deduced from fits to the cmb , the bbn model predicts abundances of the light elements which are more - or - less consistent with those inferred from astronomical observations .",
    "this near agreement places significant limits on non - standard models which influence the cosmic nuclear abundances .    in this regard , unstable massive particles decaying during or after the bbn epoch are strongly constrained  @xcite . for example , radiative decay  @xcite , hadronic decay , or annihilation  @xcite have been studied recently , and several critical constraints on the relic particle properties were derived .",
    "these particle processes induce electromagnetic and/or hadronic showers which lead to the destruction of preexisting nuclei and to the production of different nuclear species . in turn , these modifications to the light element abundances are used to constrain theories for the decay of relic particles . the physics associated with the general decay process ( including a hadronic decay component )",
    "is explained in  @xcite .    super - weakly interacting massive particles ( swimps )",
    "have been proposed  @xcite as candidates for cosmological dark matter .",
    "they are a form of non - baryonic dark matter derived from theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) such as supersymmetry or universal extra dimensions ( ued )  @xcite .",
    "the stable particles in these theories may constitute the dark matter , while the unstable particles could decay to modify the nuclear abundances in the early universe .",
    "this type of dark - matter particle interacts super - weakly with the sm fields and can not be detected directly in experiments searching for conventional wimps .",
    "thus , further studies of decay - induced nucleosynthesis could help to constrain such new particle theories .",
    "spectroscopic lithium abundances have been detected in the atmospheres of metal poor stars .",
    "nearly constant abundances of @xmath1li and @xmath0li in metal - poor population ii ( pop  ii ) stars have been inferred  @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic measurements obtained with high resolution indicate that metal poor halo stars ( mphss ) have a very large abundance of @xmath1li , i.e.  at a level of about a twentieth that of @xmath0li .",
    "this is about three orders of magnitude larger than the sbbn prediction of the @xmath1li abundance .",
    "it was suggested some time ago  @xcite that a high @xmath1li abundance could be produced via particle decay .",
    "more recently , radiative particle decay in particular has been proposed  @xcite as the source of the abundant @xmath1li observed in low metallicity stars .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested  @xcite that hadronic decays which occur at around 1000 seconds after the big - bang could simultaneously resolve both the @xmath1li and @xmath0li abundance issues .",
    "this probability has been studied within the context of supersymmetry , and there is sufficient parameter space for this to be possible  @xcite .",
    "a previous study on the radiative decay , however , was unable to provide a thorough solution to the lithium abundance puzzle  @xcite . in this paper , therefore , we consider this issue to be as of yet unresolved .",
    "we independently calculate the nucleosynthesis triggered by the radiative decay processes of long - lived relic particles over a wide range of parameters specifying the properties of the relic particles .",
    "we take into account the primary , secondary , and tertiary processes resulting from the electromagnetic cascade showers which both produce and destroy the light elements .",
    "we then constrain the abundance of long - lived particles from the calculated nucleosynthesis .",

    "another feature regarding this scenario of non - thermal @xmath1li production triggered by the radiative decay is that it does not resolve the lithium problem .",
    "other mechanisms such as the stellar depletion of the lithium isotopes must operate to lower the @xmath0li abundance in the atmosphere of mphss .",
    "in such mechanisms , however , @xmath1li should be simultaneously depleted . in the parameter region , @xmath200  s and @xmath183  gev , the @xmath0li abundance is almost unchanged from the sbbn value even should the radiative decay of unstable particles and subsequent non - thermal nucleosynthesis be taken into consideration .",
    "only @xmath1li is enhanced by about three orders of magnitude higher than the sbbn value .",
    "this enhancement can be as much as several times the observed @xmath1li abundance in mphss .",
    "hence , the present scenario remains a viable possibility for @xmath1li enhancement if the true depletion mechanisms or other systematic effects lead to approximately the same degree of depletion for both @xmath1li and @xmath0li .    in summary",
    ", we have found a parameter region of @xmath200  s and @xmath183  gev where the non - thermal nucleosynthesis of @xmath1li can explain the observed abundance level in mphss .",

    "<S> recent spectroscopic observations of metal poor stars have indicated that both @xmath0li and @xmath1li have abundance plateaus with respect to the metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> abundances of @xmath0li are about a factor three lower than the primordial abundance predicted by standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , and @xmath1li abundances are @xmath2 of @xmath0li , whereas sbbn predicts negligible amounts of @xmath1li compared to the detected level . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies suggest that @xmath1li has another cosmological or galactic origin than the sbbn . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it would appear that @xmath0li ( and also @xmath1li ) has been depleted from its primordial abundance by some post - bbn processes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the possibility that the radiative decay of long - lived particles has affected the cosmological lithium abundances . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the non - thermal nucleosynthesis associated with the radiative decay taking account both of the primary nuclear production reactions and the effects of secondary production as well as the destruction processes of energetic nuclides d , t , @xmath3he , @xmath4he , @xmath1li and @xmath0li . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the allowed region of the parameters specifying the properties of long - lived particles . </S>",
    "<S> we also impose constraints from observations of the cmb energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that non - thermal nucleosynthesis produces @xmath1li at the level detected in metal poor halo stars ( mphss ) , when the lifetime of the unstable particles is of the order @xmath5  s and their initial abundance with respect to that of the photons is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the emitted photon energy in the radiative decay . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the most likely nucleosynthetic scenario involves two different processes . </S>",
    "<S> first , a non - thermal cosmological nucleosynthesis associated with the radiative decay of unstable particles ; and second , the stellar depletion of both of the primordial lithium isotopic abundances . </S>"
