    "social systems  particularly human social systems  process information . from the price - setting functions of free - market economies",
    "@xcite to resource management in traditional communities  @xcite , and from deliberations in large - scale democracies  @xcite to the formation of opinions and spread of reputational information in organizations  @xcite and social groups  @xcite , it has been recognized that such groups can perform functions analogous to ( and often better than ) engineered systems .",
    "such functional roles are found in groups in addition to their contingent historical aspects and , when described mathematically , may be compared across cultures and times .",
    "the computational phenomena implicit in social systems are only now , with the advent of large , high - resolution data - sets , coming under systematic , empirical study at large scales .",
    "while such studies are well advanced in the case of both human  @xcite and non - human  @xcite communication , these methods have not been widely applied in the study of collective social behavior .",
    "we study a particular phenomenon , that of cooperation in the online , open source wikipedia community , with the goal of distinguishing between different classes of computational sophistication .",
    "we focus on the distinction between finite and non - finite models , where the latter have access to an effectively unbounded resource , such as a counter , stack or queue  @xcite .",
    "a feature common to all such analyses is that a finite amount of data _ by itself _ can never distinguish between two classes whose distinctions are defined in terms of bounded _ vs. _ unbounded resources .",
    "this is sometimes understood in terms of the competence - performance distinction ; see refs .  @xcite and@xcite .",
    "our argument for the emergence of non - finite computational properties thus relies on model selection , and the statistical inference of asymptotic properties of a finite - state system . as part of this argument",
    "we prove a result that we refer to as the _ probabilistic pumping lemma _ : for any finite - state process , and any string @xmath0 , of sufficient length , produced by the process , the probability that a word of length @xmath1 is found to be @xmath2 decays exponentially as @xmath3 becomes large .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we state , and prove , the lemma described above , in the first section , and appendix  s1 .",
    "we establish the main empirical result of this work in the second section , where we examine the symbolic dynamics of article editing in wikipedia . in considering the top ten most - edited articles in the encyclopdia",
    ", we find strong evidence in a majority of cases for a violation of the probabilistic pumping lemma , and thus computation over and above that of the finite - state .",
    "we then discuss the possible origins of this effectively resource - unbounded system in the third section .",
    "we conclude with the implications of this finding for the complexity of social systems , and compare our findings with recent work and explore the analogy between formal grammars and social behavior .",
    "in order to distinguish between finite and non - finite models , we focus on the statistics of repeated behavioral patterns , or `` words '' . in this section , we show explicitly that probabilistic finite - state process have an exponential cutoff in the asymptotic distribution of repeated words .",
    "our discussion here relies on the properties of @xmath4 or , in words , `` the probability of the word @xmath5 '' , or , more explicitly , `` the probability that a randomly drawn string of length @xmath6 will be @xmath5 . ''",
    "measurement of @xmath4 from data is non - trivial , and detailed discussion of this appears in appendix  s3 .",
    "our proof establishes the existence of an exponential cutoff by showing that the limiting ratio of @xmath4 ( the probability of observing the word @xmath0 repeated @xmath7 times in a sample of length @xmath6 ) , and @xmath8 , as @xmath7 becomes large , approaches a constant strictly between zero and one .",
    "we will be able to determine that limiting constant in terms of the properties of the underlying system .",
    "_ statement of lemma_. for any probabilistic finite - state process , any initial distribution over internal states , and any word @xmath0 , where ( 1 ) for all @xmath9 there exists a @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and ( 2 ) the system does not deterministically repeat a single word , there exists a positive real number @xmath12 such that @xmath13 } = \\epsilon , \\label{ppl_formal}\\ ] ] as @xmath7 becomes large , with @xmath14 , @xmath12 _ strictly _ greater than zero and _ strictly _ less than one .",
    "the limiting value , @xmath12 , is the spectral radius of @xmath15 , the natural extension of the symbol transition matrix to multi - letter words .    the complete proof is given in appendix  s1",
    ". tests of the numerical convergence of this relation are presented in appendix  s2 , where we study how small machines ( number of states of order ten ) converge to the bound of eq .",
    "[ ppl_formal ] for a uniform prior over spectral radius .",
    "informally , the lemma says that @xmath4 is bounded above by an exponential cutoff of the form @xmath16 , @xmath14 . for most processes ,",
    "the relevant scale for the limit to obtain is @xmath7 of order @xmath9 , the number of states in the underlying process .",
    "given this , and under the mild assumption that the system has passed through its transient states to one of its aperiodic final classes , the asymptotic probability @xmath4 takes the form of a sum of exponentials , @xmath17 where here @xmath3 is the number of classes , and @xmath18 are all strictly between zero and one .",
    ".  [ alpha_simp ] , which we refer to as the nexp model , forms the basis of our model comparisons , and the evidence for non - finite - state computation , presented in the next section .",
    "note that , for the special case of a purely deterministic ( non - probabilistic ) machine , where each state has only one transition , either ( 1 ) @xmath4 will be zero for all @xmath7 greater than some fixed value or ( 2 ) the output string will just be repetitions of @xmath0 ; either violates the conditions of the lemma .",
    "deterministic machines can be recognized by looking for exact repetitions ; the more general case that violates eq .",
    "[ alpha_simp ] , aperiodicity , can be recognized by non - monotonic behavior .",
    "note also that the absence of a violation of the probabilistic pumping lemma is not evidence against non - finite - state computation . even in the case of infinite data ,",
    "it is easy to construct non - finite - state processes that show exponential decay in all repeated strings ; an example can be constructed for a stochastic context - free language that generates strings of matched , but arbitrarily nested , parentheses : `` ...",
    "( ) ( ( ( ) ) ( ) ) ... '' .",
    "we now consider a real - world example of collective behavior in a human social system .",
    "we are interested in the underlying computational structure of the process , and in particular , the question of whether the system might have access to an unbounded resource . to that end",
    ", we compare an infinite - resource model to the general finite - state case using model selection .      a finite - state model , given a sufficient number of states , can reproduce the statistics of an arbitrary process . in statistical study",
    ", one must therefore ask when the data justify a simpler ( if non - finite ) model with fewer parameters .",
    "this is known as _ model selection_.    model selection provides a principled and self - consistent way to select between different descriptions of a process , and to determine ( among other things ) when adding additional parameters to a model is justified . without model selection",
    ", it would be impossible to establish the existence of a power - law ( as opposed to a sum of exponentials ) , a sine function ( as opposed to a finite number of terms in its taylor series expansion ) , or a linear trend ( as opposed to a truncation of its fourier decomposition ) .",
    "model selection is often done informally , based on the intuitive appeal of one model over another . here , we attempt a more rigorous approach based on bayesian methods . the bayes factor , which provides a self - consistent method for model selection , is now in wide use in the biological  @xcite and physical sciences  @xcite .",
    "it is of particular use when the question concerns selection between competing hypotheses , rather than ( as happens in the frequentist paradigm ) the rejection of a null hypothesis  @xcite .    for model selection ,",
    "there are two relevant quantities .",
    "the first is @xmath19 , the log - likelihood of the posterior , or the log of the probability of the data given the best choices of parameters for the model in question , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a particular model , @xmath22 is the vector of parameters associated with @xmath21 , and @xmath23 is the data .",
    "models of sufficient generality can , with sufficiently many parameters , make @xmath19 arbitrarily large for a given data - set .",
    "the second quantity , @xmath24 , is the bayesian evidence for the model , or , the log - likelihood of the data averaged over all possible parameter values , @xmath25 it is the bayesian evidence @xmath24 that allows us , in a consistent fashion , to select between models ; the reader is referred to ref",
    ".  @xcite . meanwhile , the log - likelihood @xmath19 is useful as a diagnostic to see which features of the data are relevant .",
    "the bayesian evidence requires use of a prior , @xmath26 ; careful specification of the prior is necessary to avoid unfairly penalizing one model over another . in both models we consider ,",
    "parameters may specify ( 1 ) an overall normalization , ( 2 ) relative amplitudes of different components , or ( 3 ) timescales of decay .",
    "we place uniform priors on normalization and decay timescales ( within reasonable bounds ) , and model the priors for relative amplitudes as uniform on the simplex .",
    "to compute @xmath24 , we use a standard approximation ( ref .",
    "@xcite ; see appendix  s4 ) .",
    "this quantity can be directly interpreted as the log - probability in favor of a model , given the data ; thus @xmath27 , the difference between @xmath24 for two models , corresponds to the log probability in favor of one model versus the other .",
    "we consider the `` edit history '' of encyclopdia articles , taken individually .",
    "these histories amount to a time - series of editor behaviors : the time - stamped changes to the page made by individuals ( either anonymous , or pseudonymous ) .",
    "coarse - graining of these histories is necessary : the number of possible edits that editors can make is essentially unbounded and any edit may change , add , or delete arbitrary amounts of text from the article .",
    "a well - known distinction , however , exists between edits that alter the text in a novel fashion and those that `` roll back '' the text to a previous state .",
    "the latter kind of edit , called a `` revert '' is used when an editor disagrees with an edit made by someone else and , instead of altering the text further , undoes the work of his or her opponent ; as we describe below , revert edits are strongly correlated in time with conflict , and are themselves considered anti - social actions in the context of normal editing .",
    "we thus coarse - grain the history of edits made on an article into two classes , r ( `` revert '' ) and c ( `` cooperate '' : any non - revert edit ) .",
    "an example of this process is shown in table  [ sample_history ] , while the details of our processing of the raw data are given in appendix  s3 .",
    ".a day of edits on the george_w._bush page , starting at midnight utc , 21 march 2006 .",
    "as can be seen by comparing sha1 hashes of the page content , user mhking reverted an edit by user alexh25 to the previous version by user sarah . later in the day , user brandon39 reverted user brazilfantoo . in between , one can see `` cooperative '' stretches involving both single and multiple users .",
    "this sequence of events is coarse - grained into the substring `` ccrccrccccc . ''",
    "the full string of ( in this case ) 45,220 action symbols forms the basis of the finite - state analysis . as with all data used in this study , this sequence is publicly available , in this case at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=george_w._bush&offset=200603218&action=history[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=george_w._bush&offset=200603218&action=history ] [ last accessed 15 august 2013 ] .
