    "it is expected that resonances with higher transverse momentum are more likely to be reconstructed because of their longer relative lifetimes due to their ultra - relativistic velocities .",
    "this means they are more likely to decay outside the medium and hence their daughter particles will interact less with the medium in @xmath2  collisions .",
    "any loss of low @xmath4  baryons will cause an increase in the measured  of the observed @xmath4 spectra for the central @xmath2  collisions with respect to @xmath0  collisions .",
    "however we do not see any significant increase in the  for the @xmath20 from minimum bias @xmath0  to the most central @xmath2collisions within the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "it is possible that the production of the higher mass particles in @xmath0collisions is biased towards higher multiplicity collisions .",
    "if the higher mass particles are produced in more violent ( mini - jet ) @xmath0  collisions compared to lower mass particles , the @xmath21 for heavy particles in @xmath0  collisions would be larger .",

    "it is possible to model the spectrum with pythia with the factor k=3 while the default ( k=1 ) spectrum is too soft .",
    "this k - factor , which represents a simple factorization of next - to - leading order processes ( nlo ) in the pythia leading order ( lo ) calculation , is directly related to the @xmath4  spectrum .",
    "an increase in the k factor implies that larger nlo contributions ( mini - jet events ) are required to describe the  production .",
    "the high ( k=3 ) factor is also needed to describe heavy strange baryons such as the @xmath8 and the @xmath22 , while the spectra predicted with this high k factor are too hard for the light mesons @xcite . in @xmath2",
    "collisions , there is evidence that heavier particles flow radially with a smaller boost velocity due to their smaller cross section than the lighter mass particles .",
    "these two independent effects in @xmath0  and @xmath2  collisions may cause the apparent merging of the @xmath21 .    in a thermal model ,",
    "the measured ratios of resonance to non - resonant particles with identical valence quarks are sensitive to the chemical freeze - out temperature , as all of the quark content dependencies cancel out @xcite .",
    "while these models predict the measured @xmath5 ratio correctly within errors , they suggest a higher ratio than the measured @xmath23 in the most central @xmath2  collisions .",
    "this suggests an extended hadronic phase of elastic and pseudo - elastic interactions after chemical freeze - out , where re - scattering of resonance decay particles and regeneration of resonances will occur .",
    "the nuclear modification factor for the  in comparison to other mesons and baryons in @xmath1  collisions can be found in figure  [ fig : nuclearmoddauall ] .",
    "the @xmath24 measurements , for mesons on the left and for baryons on the right , mostly follow participant scaling at low momenta . at higher momentum , baryons show a greater enhancement over the binary scaling than the mesons .",
    "the  baryon follows a similar trend to @xmath25 .",
    "the enhancement over binary scaling can be described by the cronin effect , a generic term for the experimentally observed broadening of transverse momentum spectra at intermediate @xmath4  in @xmath15+a collisions as compared to @xmath0 .",
    "it is surprising that the @xmath26 meson shows no enhancement above binary collisions and even falls below @xmath9 mesons , while the other resonances and their stable particles show no clear difference in their @xmath24 .",
