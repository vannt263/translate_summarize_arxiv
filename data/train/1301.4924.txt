    "the solution of quantum field theories by the complete characterization of their spectrum ( eigenvalues and eigenstates ) and dynamics ( time dependent correlation functions ) is one of the fundamental issues in mathematical physics as it should lead to exact ( non - perturbative ) results in several areas of physics where these models play a central role . the 1 + 1-dimensional case@xcite is the most natural framework where to try to solve exactly this problem thanks to the powerful tools of quantum integrability@xcite . despite significant progresses obtained in the last forty years for some lattice models ( like the heisenberg spin chains ) , the full solution of more general integrable quantum field theories ( iqfts ) is still a fundamental open problem .",
    "our main aim is to define a microscopic approach for the exact solution of 1 + 1-dimensional quantum field theories by integrable lattice regularizations in the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) . in this framework ,",
    "the quantum integrable structure : @xmath0=0\\text { \\ } \\forall \\lambda , \\mu \\in \\mathbb{c},\\text { \\ } % h\\in \\mathsf{t}(\\lambda ) \\ ] ] of a quantum model of hamiltonian @xmath1@xmath2 on the quantum ( hilbert ) space @xmath3 is defined by the one - parameter family of _ transfer matrices _ : @xmath4here , we are restricting ourselves to a _ monodromy matrix _",

    "the elements of @xmath12 are the generators of a representation in @xmath3 of the yang - baxter algebra and , for invertible @xmath13-matrix , the commutation relations ( [ yba ] ) imply the mutual commutativity of the one - parameter family of transfer matrices @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth recalling that some classes of massive integrable quantum field theories ( iqfts ) in infinite volume can be defined avoiding a microscopic lattice regularization .",
    "indeed , they admit an _ _ on - shell__@xcite exact and complete characterization by the exact s - matrices which fixes the asymptotic particle dynamics .",
    "the main difficulty here is that any information needs to be extracted from the particle dynamics .",
    "in particular , a direct connection between local fields and form factors ( their matrix elements on asymptotic particle states ) is absent and the form factors are characterized axiomatically as solutions of a set of functional equations@xcite completely fixed by the exact s - matrix .",
    "different methods have addressed this longstanding problem and the description of massive iqfts as ( superrenormalizable ) perturbations of conformal field theories by relevant local fields@xcite has characterized one important research line .",
    "the consequent hypothesis of isomorphism of the local field content between massive theories and the corresponding ultraviolet conformal ones has been verified for some fundamental iqfts both for the chiral@xcite and the non - chiral local fields@xcite by form factor analysis .",
    "these are important results on the global structure of the local operator spaces of the massive iqfts but they do not really lead to the identification of particular local fields .",
    "it is worth recalling that in@xcite a criterion based on the quasi - classical characterization of the local fields has been introduce to define the correspondence between local fields and form factors .",
    "it has been fully described in the special cases of the restricted sine - gordon model at the reflectionless points for chiral fields and verified on the basis of counting arguments . from the above discussion",
    "it is then clear that in the s - matrix formulation the main open problem remains the absence of a direct reconstruction of the quantum local fields .",
    "one of our main motivations to develop an integrable microscopic approach to quantum field theories is to introduce an exact setup where to overcome the identification problem in the s - matrix formulation . indeed , in the qism framework",
    ", we can use the so - called solution of the quantum inverse scattering problem , a central achievements in the lyon group method@xcite , which applies to a large class of lattice integrable quantum models and allows to write explicitly the local operators in terms of the global yang - baxter generators .",
    "such a result plays a key role in the derivation of multiple integral representations of correlation functions as it is at the basis of the algebraic computations of the local operator actions on the transfer matrix eigenstates .",
    "the lyon group method has been develop by using the algebraic bethe ansatz ( aba ) as central tool for the spectrum characterization .",
    "however , aba does not work for important integrable quantum models on the contrary of the sklyanin s quantum separation of variables ( sov)@xcite .",
    "this beautiful method is quite general and powerful to describe the spectrum of these models ; it leads to both the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the transfer matrix with a spectrum construction ( which under simple conditions ) has as built - in feature its completeness .",
    "moreover , in the sov framework , for the so far analyzed quantum models@xcite it was an easy task to prove their complete quantum integrability ; i.e. the simplicity of the transfer matrix spectrum . our aim is to develop a method based on the sklyanin s sov which exactly characterize the spectrum and the dynamics ( correlation functions ) of iqfts according to the following general schema :    : :    solution of the spectral problem , for the lattice and the continuum    theories : solution of the spectral problem for the integrable lattice    regularizations ; i.e. sov construction of transfer matrix eigenstates    and eigenvalues .",

    "let us complete this contribution evidencing the fundamental feature of universality which emerges in the characterization of both the spectrum and the dynamics by our approach in sov .",
    "indeed , this appears clearly by the analysis of several others fundamental integrable quantum models associated to more general cyclic representations , to highest weight representations of 6-vertex and dynamical 6-vertex as well as to spin-1/2 representations of 8-vertex yang - baxter algebra and of general 6-vertex reflection algebra .",
    "indeed , the results derived in@xcite show that a part from model dependent features , like the nature of the spectrum of the quantum separate variables , the coefficients in the baxter equation and the sov - reconstruction of local operators , the spectrum and dynamics admit the same type of representations . in particular , the form factors are expressible as determinants of matrices with elements the convolutions  over the spectrum of the separate variables of baxter equation solutions plus contributions coming from the local operators ; i.e. ( [ gen - melo ] ) seems universal .",
    "the next natural step is to complete for the sine - gordon model the described integrable microscopic program .",
    "indeed , the main point to complete is which defines the form factors in the infinite volume limit and allows for the comparison with those in the s - matrix formulation in this way solving the local field identification problem .",
    "finally , the most intriguing projects are related to the generalization of this analysis to more advanced quantum models like those associated to higher rank quantum spin chains of fundamental interest in gauge theories and also to models like hubbard model which is a celebrated model in condensed matter theory as it describes both the charge and the spin degrees of freedom .",
