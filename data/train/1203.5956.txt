    "[ fig : vhesources ] left ) .",
    "the detected source population is still dominated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , but recently starburst galaxies have also been established as extragalactic vhe emitters @xcite .",
    "the key science questions in the field are ( still ) investigating the origin and physics mechanism responsible for the vhe emission in agns and thereby probe the conditions of particle acceleration and cooling in relativistic plasma outflows and in the vicinity of super - massive black holes ( smbh ) .",
    "one of the most striking observational result of the recent years was the discovery of rapid variability with minute time - scales @xcite , which has not yet fully been integrated in the theories .",
    "such short variability time - scales strongly impact the canonical modeling of the vhe emission in synchtrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) frameworks , requiring large bulk lorentz factors of the emission region ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , new source classes have been established as vhe emitters e.g. radio galaxies ( m87 , centaurusa ) , low- and medium - frequency peaked bl lac objects , etc . with the launch of the fermi satellite in 2008 ,",
    "a wealth of new information on the extragalactic sky in the 100mev to 100gev energy regime became available , strongly influencing the science programs in the vhe domain .",
    "the multi - wavelength ( mwl ) aspect , in general , plays a crucial role in investigating vhe emission from agn : the limited angular resolution of vhe instruments usually does not allow for a precise spatial determination of the origin of the emission in extragalactic objects . investigating the mwl behavior e.g. by searching for correlations with high resolution radio observations allows one to probe spatial scales down to a few hundred schwarzschild radii of the smbh @xcite .",
    "new insights into the structure of the magnetic fields in agn jets also come from polarimetric observations in the optical and radio .",
    "extragalactic vhe sources are also successfully used to study the meta - galactic radiation and magnetic fields ( e.g. @xcite ) . in such studies ,",
    "the extragalactic vhe sources are used as",
    "_ lighthouses _ , whose emission gets altered by the intervening fields .",
