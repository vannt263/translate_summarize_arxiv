    "in contrast , optical nanofibers @xcite with a diameter smaller than the wavelength of the guided light exhibit a strong lateral confinement of the guided mode in conjunction with a pronounced evanescent field surrounding the fiber @xcite . these properties make optical nanofibers a unique tool for efficient and controlled coupling of light with matter on or near their surface .",
    "a wide range of nanofiber applications are emerging in fields like , e.g. , optical sensing @xcite , nanofiber - based evanescent wave spectroscopy @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , cold atom physics @xcite , probing of nano - cavities and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) @xcite , coupling to nano - cavity lasers @xcite or single quantum dot spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "for these applications , high - quality nanofibers with a high diameter uniformity and low surface roughness are required , rendering the technical realization a demanding process .",
    "a standard fabrication method for optical nanofibers is flame pulling of commercial single mode optical fibers resulting in tapered optical fibers ( tofs ) with a nanofiber waist @xcite .",
    "efficient coupling of the light into and out of the nanofiber waist requires a careful design of the taper profile @xcite .",

    ", we present scanning electron microscope measurements of the tof profile and compare the experimental results with the theoretically predicted target profile .",

    "sec : characterization ] we present a method for measuring the diameter of the nanofiber waist , which is based on second and third harmonic generation and has an accuracy of better than 2@xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : surface ] of this paper , we focus on applications of nanofibers for surface spectroscopy . fiber - based evanescent wave spectroscopy ( ews ) offers stability , fast response and applications with _ in situ _ measurements . motivated by these advantages ,",
    "fiber - based ews sensors have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the sensitivity of nanofiber spectroscopy depends strongly on the fiber diameter @xmath0 and the fiber length @xmath1 : at resonance , the absorption probability per surface adsorbed particle with absorption cross section @xmath2 can be roughly estimated to be @xmath3 because , in the fiber waist of a silica nanofiber , the light field can be confined to an effective cross section on the order of @xmath4 , similar to a strongly focused light beam .",
    "in contrast to the situation in free space , this confinement is however maintained along the entire fiber length @xmath1 , and hence the typical depth of focus of a free space beam is enhanced by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude . as we show in detail in sect .",
    "[ theory ] , the spectroscopic sensitivity @xmath5 of the nanofiber scales as    @xmath6    where we assumed @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the value for a free space beam .",
    "therefore , the strongly confined light in the nanofiber can be considered as an extremely elongated `` infinite '' focus .",
    "we demonstrate the versatility of fiber - based ews by a series of absorption and fluorescence measurements performed on systems like surface - adsorbed organic molecules or quantum dots .",
    "further , fiber - based ews is also suited for spectroscopic measurements of atoms surrounding the nanofiber , as shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : cs ] on the example of caesium vapor .",
    "finally , we use nanofibers for the realization of an interferometric sensor based on the interference of two co - propagating transversal modes along the tof @xcite .",
    "the first experimental results are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : interferometer ] .",
    "this technique is highly sensitive to changes in the refractive index in the vicinity of the nanofiber surface and therefore opens the route towards dispersive measurements on surface adsorbates @xcite .",
    "in the following , we summarize the fabrication procedure of our nanofibers .",
    "all our experiments are performed using the nanofiber waist of tapered optical fibers ( tofs ) .",
    "we produce the tofs by stretching a standard optical fiber while heating it with a traveling hydrogen / oxygen flame @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the fiber pulling rig is shown in fig .  [ fig_pulling ] .",
    "it consists of two linear translation stages , the translator and the stretcher , which allow sub - micrometer positioning , and is equipped with precisely parallel aligned v - groove holders to which the fiber is clamped and tightened .",
    "a computer - controlled hydrogen / oxygen burner , located between these two holders , provides a clean flame .",
    "the flame heats a section of the fiber with a length of approximately 1  mm to a temperature of about @xmath9 , making it soft and malleable .",
    "the translator moves the fiber back and forth above the flame while the stretcher simultaneously elongates it . due to volume conservation",
    ", the fiber diameter is thus gradually reduced .",
    "we use an analytic algorithm in order to calculate the trajectories of the translator and of the stretcher to obtain a predetermined fiber shape .",
    "this process allows us to fabricate tofs with a homogeneous waist of diameters down to 100  nm and a typical length of 110  mm @xcite .",
    "the transmission of light through the fiber is continuously monitored during the pulling process , yielding valuable information for quality control of the taper and its overall transmission . for monochromatic light of 850  nm wavelength and a nanofiber with a 500-nm diameter waist , our fabrication procedure yields up to @xmath10 of the initial fiber transmission .",
    "figure  [ fig_fiber ] shows a schematic of a tof with three sections exhibiting different propagation properties : the nanofiber waist ( a ) surrounded by the two taper transitions ( b ) and the original unstretched fiber ( c ) .",
    "the intensitiy distribution of the corresponding guided mode is schematically represented by filled curves .    in the unmodified part of the single mode tof ,",
    "the light is guided inside the core via total internal reflection at the core - cladding boundary . due to the low refractive index difference between core and cladding ( @xmath11 ) , this section",
    "is often designated as weakly guiding and maxwell s equations are approximately solved by linearly polarized ( lp ) modes @xcite . in the taper transition ,",
    "both cladding and core shrink .",
    "the decrease of the core diameter leads to a slight compression of the guided mode until the mode diameter reaches a minimum .",
    "further reduction of the core diameter leads to an expansion of the mode into the cladding .",
    "the cladding then acts as the new guiding medium . in order to minimize transmission losses",
    ", this mode conversion should be adiabatic , i.e. , there should be no coupling of the fundamental mode to higher transverse or radiative modes .",
    "this is achieved by maintaining shallow taper angles of a few milliradians @xcite .",
    "further decrease of the fiber diameter to the waist value causes the mode to be more and more laterally confined .",
    "the high refractive index difference at the cladding - air interface ( @xmath12 ) allows a much tighter radial confinement . throughout the nanofiber waist , the diameter of the fiber remains constant in the sub - wavelength regime , and the guided mode exhibits tight radial confinement and strong evanescent field . at the second taper transition ,",
    "the mode transformation is reversed .",
    "note , that through this process the weakly guided lp@xmath13 mode of the unstretched fiber is adiabatically transformed into the strongly guided he@xmath14 mode of the nanofiber and back .    the intensity distribution of a circularly or unpolarized he@xmath14 mode is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_int_distribution ] as a function of the distance from the fiber center",
    ". the intensity is maximal at the fiber center and decreases towards the surface . due to the high refractive index jump at the surface , the radial component of the electric field",
    "exhibits a correspondingly strong discontinuity , while the tangential components of the electric field remain continuous @xcite . in the nanofiber , for visible wavelengths",
    "the decay length of the evanescent field is typically on the order of few hundreds of nanometers .",
    "the strong intensity achieved at the fiber surface provides excellent conditions for high - sensitivity spectroscopic measurements and non - linear optical experiments .",
    "light propagation in a nanofiber is usually described using the concept of an effective refractive index @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the vacuum speed of light , @xmath17 is the phase velocity of the mode , @xmath18 is the mode propagation constant , and @xmath19 is the vacuum wavenumber @xcite . the propagation constant @xmath18 is obtained by solving the transcendental equation arising from the maxwell s equations in conjunction with the boundary conditions applied to the nanofiber geometry @xcite . for this purpose , we have created a matlab toolbox that allows us to automatically calculate all relevant parameters of the nanofiber guided modes @xcite . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : bonn_modes ] shows the effective refractive indices of the lowest nanofiber modes as a function of the waist diameter .",
    "the single - mode and multi - mode regime can be clearly distinguished in the figure .",
    "the cutoff value at which only the fundamental he@xmath14 mode propagates is wavelength - dependent and corresponds to @xmath20 for a refractive index of @xmath21 .",
    "as the fiber diameter decreases , a larger and larger fraction of the mode propagates outside of the glass , and the effective refractive index of the mode decreases to unity . on the other hand , a fiber diameter increase leads to a mode guided mostly entirely in the bulk and the effective refractive index approaches @xmath22 . throughout this paper , with the exception of sect .",
    "[ sec : interferometer ] , adiabatic tapers are used , i.e. , to a good approximation the light is guided exclusively in the fundamental he@xmath14 mode .",
    "the knowledge of the fiber diameter profile is essential for a quantitative understanding of the light propagation and of nonlinear effects in nanofibers . in order to characterize the predetermined diameter profile used by the fiber pulling rig we performed scanning electron microscope ( sem ) measurements .",
    "although this method can offer an accuracy of 3@xmath23 , it is time - consuming and does nt allow one to re - use the tof because it has to be put onto a substrate and needs to be gold - coated @xcite .",
    "another method for measuring the nanofiber uniformity with a precission of 2 - 3@xmath23 has been proposed @xcite that , however , gives no information about the absolute fiber diameter .",
    "we have developed a non - destructive optical method for diameter measurements with an acurracy better than 2@xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig1_transmission ] shows the diameter profile of a tof with a 320-nm diameter nanofiber waist of 1-mm length measured with a sem .",
    "it exhibits a three - fold linear taper transition with local taper angles of @xmath24  mrad , @xmath25  mrad and @xmath26  mrad with the slope changing at the fiber diameters @xmath27 m and @xmath28 m .",
    "the solid line indicates the fiber diameter profile as predicted by our algorithm and the inset shows a magnification of the submicron - diameter region of the profile containing the waist with a length of 1  mm .",
    "the nanofiber was mounted on a gold coated substrate for the sem measurement ( see @xcite for technical details ) . in order to determine the local fiber diameter",
    ", we successively took electron micrographs along the tof with a step size varying between 0.25 and 1  mm .",
    "the measured diameter profile closely follows the predicted profile with deviations smaller than 10@xmath23 .",
    "for the two linear sections with local taper angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , they even fall below 5@xmath23 . from this excellent agreement",
    "we conclude that our production procedure for nanofibers indeed realizes the predicted profiles to a very good approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig : waist_sem ] shows the detailed measurement of the waist region of a nanofiber using a zeiss supra  55 field - emission sem .",
    "since the manufacturer guaranties an accuracy of only @xmath31 , we have recalibrated the sem for each measurement series and thereby achieved an improvement of the absolute accuracy to below @xmath32 ( see @xcite for further technical details ) .",
    "our fiber pulling rig produces a waist with less than @xmath33 diameter variation , sufficiently uniform for the experiments reported here . at the same time , the pulling algorithm predicted a waist diameter of 393  nm while the sem measurement yield a value of 415  nm .",
    "this accuracy of about 5agrees well with the global nanofiber shape measurement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_transmission ] .      the optical method for measuring the waist diameter",
    "is based on second and third harmonic generation ( shg and thg ) in a bare silica nanofiber in air @xcite .",
    "efficient harmonic generation requires that the phase - matching condition is fulfilled , i.e. , the effective refractive indices of the fundamental and harmonic waves have to be equal .",
    "phase - matching for the two fundamental modes of both waves is difficult to achieve due to material dispersion and the wavelength dependence of the effective indices of the modes in a nanofiber ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : bonn_modes ] ) .",
    "however , the same effective refractive index dependence on the fiber diameter allows one to fulfill the phase - matching condition if the harmonic light propagates in a higher transverse mode . if the wavelength changes , the effective refractive index curves shift and the phase - matching condition occurs at a different fiber diameter . there exists a one to one relation between the fiber diameter and the phase - matched wavelength for each mode .",

    "the tpef spectrum is obtained directly after starting the excitation process since the tpef intensity decreases rapidly due to photobleaching of the molecules . in fact , in a separate measurement , the temporal behavior of the tpef strength has been recorded by replacing the spectrometer with a photomultiplier . the result is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_two_photon ] . starting with an initial value of @xmath86 adsorbed rh6 g molecules , the tpef vanishes within seconds . at this point",
    "the absorbance is also zero and therefore , no undamaged molecules remain adsorbed at the fiber surface .",
    "we have further investigated whether the spectroscopic method used for organic molecules can be also applied to quantum dots .",
    "quantum dots are nanometer - scale semiconductor particles with a high fluorescence quantum yield , a much better resistance to photobleaching in comparison to organic molecules and a fluorescence emission wavelength that is size - dependent .",
    "the experimental setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_fluorescence ] has been used . for excitation",
    ", we use a continuous - wave diode laser at a wavelength of 405  nm .",
    "the measurement was performed using a 450-nm diameter nanofiber with a waist length of 5  mm fabricated from a fibercore sm800 fiber .",
    "a solution of cdse quantum dots ( pl - qd - o-570 from plasmachem gmbh , core diameter 3.3  nm , total diameter 8.9  nm ) dissolved in heptane with a mass concentration of 0.036  % was deposited by the drip method on the nanofiber waist . the absorption spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : fig_qd ] . from the absorbance value of 0.043 and the absorption cross section of @xmath87 at 2.22  ev ( calculated from the molar extinction coefficient of @xmath88 provided by the manufacturer )",
    ", we estimate that about @xmath89 quantum dots were adsorbed on the nanofiber waist .",
    "the corresponding surface coverage of 0.3  % of a ml is calculated by assuming that the spherical quantum dots arrange in one full monolayer in the geometrically most compact form .",
    "the fluorescence spectrum , obtained by exciting the quantum dots with 36  nw of laser light at 405  nm , is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_qd ] .",
    "the fluorescence maximum at 2.15  ev differs slightly from the manufacturer specifications of ( 2.175@xmath900.020 )  ev for quantum dots dissolved in chloroform .",
    "this discrepancy could be attributed to the interaction of the quantum dots with the nanofiber surface .",
    "note that , for an absorbance as low as 0.043 , the effect of self - absorption is negligible .",
    "the strong evanescent field surrounding the nanofiber waist of a tof allows light - matter interaction not only with surface - adsorbed species but also with media surrounding the fiber .",
    "this feature allowed us to perform hot caesium vapor spectroscopy with a nanofiber .",
    "the experimental setup consists of a tunable single - mode diode laser , a nanofiber in a vacuum chamber , and a silicon photodiode as a detector .",
    "the chamber contains a reservoir of liquid caesium , which is heated to 70@xmath91 , thereby providing a caesium vapor pressure of approximately @xmath92  mbar during the experiment .",
    "the rest of the chamber is heated to 80@xmath91 in order to prevent caesium condensation anywhere outside the reservoir .",
    "the measurement was performed with a 450-nm diameter nanofiber with a length of 5  mm fabricated from a fibercore sm800 fiber .",
    "figure  [ fig : cs_transmission ] shows the measured transmission through the nanofiber for an input laser power of 20  nw while scanning around the caesium 2 resonance line at a wavelength of 852.3  nm .",
    "the data has been fitted using a function which is the sum of three voigt profiles corresponding to the three hyperfine transitions ( @xmath93 to @xmath94 ) of the 2 line :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the frequency , @xmath97  thz the frequency of the @xmath98 transition , @xmath99  mhz and @xmath100  mhz the separations of the hyperfine caesium levels @xcite , @xmath101 and @xmath2 the widths of the lorentzian and gaussian components of the voigt curve .",
    "the hyperfine transition strength factors for the @xmath102 , @xmath98 , @xmath103 transitions , have the values @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the fit yields the values @xmath107  mhz and @xmath108  mhz .",
    "the gaussian width agrees well with the theoretically expected value for doppler broadening at a temperature of 80@xmath91 :    @xmath109    where @xmath110  thz is the frequency of the 2 line , @xmath111 the boltzman constant , @xmath112 is the tempeature , and @xmath113  kg the mass of a caesium atom .",
    "the inferred lorentzian width is significantly larger than the natural line - width @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the 2 lifetime of 30.4  ns .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the thermal atoms pass the evanescent field of the fiber within a typical transit time of about 1  ns .",
    "these measurements show that nanofibers can also be used for high - resolution spectroscopic studies of gases and liquids surrounding the fiber waist .",
    "a similar experiment of nanofiber - based vapor spectroscopy has been done with rubidium vapor @xcite .",
    "dispersive spectroscopy is interesting because it avoids destructive effects like e.g. molecule photobleaching .",
    "a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) is the natural candidate for this purpose . with the nanofibers we realize the mzi by modal interference .",
    "the interference is achieved using the single - mode fiber pigtails of the tof as the interferometer input and output , the down - taper as a beam splitter and the up - taper as a recombiner . in comparison with the nanofiber described above",
    ", the taper slope here is steeper , i.e. non - adiabatic , in order to induce coupling between the fundamental and higher order modes .",
    "if the entire nanofiber is cylindrically symmetric around its axis , light fields can be coupled only between the modes with the same azimuthal symmetry , e.g. from the he@xmath14 mode to he@xmath116 , he@xmath117 etc .",
    "at the same time , a waist diameter can be chosen such that the he@xmath117 and the higher he@xmath118 modes are cut off ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bonn_modes ] ) , while the two lowest modes he@xmath14 and he@xmath116 are guided along the waist .",
    "since the output pigtail is a single - mode fiber , the he@xmath116 mode is not guided there .",
    "the output power thus depends on the interference in the up - taper , determined by the relative phase accumulated by the he@xmath14 and he@xmath116 modes as they propagate along the waist : light can be either coupled back into the he@xmath14 mode and guided out , or to the he@xmath116 mode and be lost by coupling to radiative modes of the up - taper .",
    "therefore the output power is given by :    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the propagation constant of a mode , @xmath1 is the propagation distance , @xmath121 is the phase accumulated by the he@xmath122 mode , and @xmath123 or  2 .",
    "the amount of light outside the fiber body is different for the he@xmath14 and he@xmath116 modes .",
    "for example , for a waist diameter of 1.3@xmath124and a wavelength of 850  nm , 2of the optical power of the he@xmath14 mode and 31of the optical power of the he@xmath116 mode is propagating in the evanescent field .",
    "figure  [ fig : bonn_interferometer_modes ] shows the calculated intensity distribution for both modes . as a result , a dispersive medium around the fiber will influence the phase accumulated by the he@xmath116 mode more strongly than that for the he@xmath14 mode and thus , create a measurable phase difference .",
    "we have implemented and tested such an interferometer . for this purpose",
    ", we use a fibercore sm800 fiber with a pure fused silica cladding , which is single - mode for wavelengths above 800  nm .",
    "the pulling rig was programmed to produce a taper slope of 16  mrad and a waist of 1.3@xmath124diameter and 3  mm length . after pulling",
    ", the interferometer was tested in the pulling rig by coupling a single - frequency diode laser at 852  nm into the input pigtail of the fiber .",
    "the output was detected with a photodiode , and the stretcher stage of the pulling rig was used to elastically stretch the fiber by a few ten micrometers .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig_int ] shows the resulting interference signal between the he@xmath14 and the he@xmath116 modes @xcite .",
    "the changes in the phase difference are expected to be given by :    @xmath125    where the term @xmath126 takes into account the influence of both the poisson and photoelastic effect on the propagation constants .",
    "the poisson effect leads to the stretch - induced change of the fiber diameter .",
    "this , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : bonn_modes ] , results in the change of the propagation constants of both of the propagating modes .",
    "the photoelastic effect explains the change of the material refractive index under strain .",
    "this change , in turn , is also influencing the propagation constants @xcite .",
    "the measurement outcome demonstrates the realization of a single - nanofiber - based interferometer with good interference contrast .",
    "a possible application of this device is to measure variations of the refractive index of the surrounding medium .",
    "the latter will differently change the propagation constants @xmath18 and thus lead to interference fringes which can then be traced .",
    "in this review , we have shown applications of fiber - based absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy .",
    "our spectroscopic technique could be useful for bio - sensing , extending the possible applications from label - free detection by absorption measurements @xcite to label - based detection using fluorescence measurements @xcite .",
    "the fact that we are able to simultaneously record absorption and fluorescence spectra for a given surface coverage , in conjunction with the stable and reproducible fluorescence collection efficiency , makes our method ideal for analyzing and quantifying dynamic processes at or near the nanofiber surface .",
    "excitation and fluorescence collection via a single fiber mode yields an entirely fiber - based method that can be used for spectroscopic studies at remote locations .",
    "we have also demonstrated our first results on the implementation of a nanofiber - based interferometer .",
    "the next goal is to perform dispersive detection on emitters adsorbed at the fiber waist and to compare the results with the absorption method .",
    "further , the dispersive method should allow us to detect species that do not absorb in the available wavelength range or to carry out measurements on sensitive molecules while avoiding photobleaching .",
