    "the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) in the large - scale clustering pattern of galaxies has rapidly become one of the most important observational pillars of the cosmological model .",
    "baos correspond to a preferred length scale imprinted in the distribution of photons and baryons by the propagation of sound waves in the relativistic plasma of the early universe ( peebles & yu 1970 , sunyaev & zeldovitch 1970 , bond & efstathiou 1984 , holtzman 1989 , hu & sugiyama 1996 , eisenstein & hu 1998 ) .",
    "a full account of the early - universe physics is provided by bashinsky & bertschinger ( 2001 , 2002 ) . in a simple intuitive description of the effect we can imagine an overdensity in the primordial dark matter distribution creating an overpressure in the tightly - coupled photon - baryon fluid and launching a spherical compression wave . at redshift @xmath14",
    "there is a precipitous decrease in sound speed due to recombination to a neutral gas and de - coupling of the photon - baryon fluid .",
    "the photons stream away and can be mapped as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ; the spherical shell of compressed baryonic matter is frozen in place .",
    "the overdense shell , together with the initial central perturbation , seeds the later formation of galaxies and imprints a preferred scale into the galaxy distribution equal to the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch .",
    "given that baryonic matter is secondary to cold dark matter in the clustering pattern , the amplitude of the effect is much smaller than the acoustic peak structure in the cmb .",
    "the measurement of baos in the pattern of late - time galaxy clustering provides a compelling validation of the standard picture that large - scale structure in today s universe arises through the gravitational amplification of perturbations seeded at early times .",
    "the small amplitude of the imprint of baos in the galaxy distribution is a demonstration that the bulk of matter consists of non - baryonic dark matter that does not couple to the relativistic plasma before recombination .",
    "furthermore , the preferred length scale  the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch  may be predicted very accurately by measurements of the cmb which yield the physical matter and baryon densities that control the sound speed , expansion rate and recombination time : the latest determination is @xmath15 mpc ( komatsu et al .",
    "therefore the imprint of baos provide a standard cosmological ruler that can map out the cosmic expansion history and provide precise and robust constraints on the nature of the `` dark energy '' that is apparently dominating the current cosmic dynamics ( blake & glazebrook 2003 ; hu & haiman 2003 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ) . in principle",
    "the standard ruler may be applied in both the tangential and radial directions of a galaxy survey , yielding measures of the angular diameter distance and hubble parameter as a function of redshift .",
    "the large scale and small amplitude of the baos imprinted in the galaxy distribution implies that galaxy redshift surveys mapping cosmic volumes of order 1 gpc@xmath16 with of order @xmath17 galaxies are required to ensure a robust detection ( tegmark 1997 , blake & glazebrook 2003 , blake et al .",
    "gathering such a sample represents a formidable observational challenge typically necessitating hundreds of nights of telescope time over several years .",
    "the leading such spectroscopic dataset in existence is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which covers @xmath18 deg@xmath19 of sky containing a `` main '' @xmath20-band selected sample of @xmath21 galaxies with median redshift @xmath22 , and a luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) extension consisting of @xmath17 galaxies but covering a significantly - greater cosmic volume with median redshift @xmath23 .",
    "eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported a convincing bao detection in the 2-point correlation function of the sdss third data release ( dr3 ) lrg sample at @xmath8 , demonstrating that this standard - ruler measurement was self - consistent with the cosmological model established from cmb observations and yielding new , tighter constraints on cosmological parameters such as the spatial curvature .",
    "percival et al .",
    "( 2010 ) undertook a power - spectrum analysis of the sdss dr7 dataset , considering both the main and lrg samples , and constrained the distance - redshift relation at both @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath24 accuracy in units of the standard ruler scale .",
    "other studies of the sdss lrg sample , producing broadly similar conclusions , have been performed by huetsi ( 2006 ) , percival et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , sanchez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and kazin et al .",
    "( 2010a ) .",
    "some analyses have attempted to separate the tangential and radial bao signatures in the lrg dataset , albeit with lower statistical significance ( gaztanaga et al .",
    "2009 , kazin et al .",
    "these studies built on earlier hints of baos reported by the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( cole et al .",
    "2005 ) and combinations of smaller datasets ( miller et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "this ambitious observational program to map out the cosmic expansion history with baos has prompted serious theoretical scrutiny of the accuracy with which we can model the bao signature and the likely amplitude of systematic errors in the measurement .",
    "the pattern of clustering laid down in the high - redshift universe is potentially subject to modulation by the non - linear scale - dependent growth of structure , by the distortions apparent when the signal is observed in redshift - space , and by the bias with which galaxies trace the underlying network of matter fluctuations . in this context",
    "the fact that the baos are imprinted on large , linear and quasi - linear scales of the clustering pattern implies that non - linear bao distortions are relatively accessible to modelling via perturbation theory or numerical n - body simulations ( eisenstein , seo & white 2007 , crocce & scoccimarro 2008 , matsubara 2008 ) .",
    "the leading - order effect is a `` damping '' of the sharpness of the acoustic feature due to the differential motion of pairs of tracers separated by 150 mpc driven by bulk flows of matter .",
    "effects due to galaxy formation and bias are confined to significantly smaller scales and are not expected to cause significant acoustic peak shifts . although the non - linear damping of baos reduces to some extent the accuracy with which the standard ruler can be applied , the overall picture remains that baos provide a robust probe of the cosmological model free of serious systematic error .",
    "the principle challenge lies in executing the formidable galaxy redshift surveys needed to exploit the technique .",
    "in particular , the present ambition is to extend the relatively low - redshift bao measurements provided by the sdss dataset to the intermediate- and high - redshift universe .",
    "higher - redshift observations serve to further test the cosmological model over the full range of epochs for which dark energy apparently dominates the cosmic dynamics , can probe greater cosmic volumes and therefore yield more accurate bao measurements , and are less susceptible to the non - linear effects which damp the sharpness of the acoustic signature at low redshift and may induce low - amplitude systematic errors . currently , intermediate redshifts have only been probed by photometric - redshift surveys which have limited statistical precision ( blake et al .",
    "2007 , padmanabhan et al .  2007 ) .    the wigglez dark energy survey at the australian astronomical observatory ( drinkwater et al .  2010 ) was designed to provide the next - generation spectroscopic bao dataset following the sdss , extending the distance - scale measurements across the intermediate - redshift range up to @xmath25 with a precision of mapping the acoustic scale comparable to the sdss lrg sample .",
    "the survey , which began in august 2006 , completed observations in january 2011 and has obtained of order @xmath26 redshifts for uv - bright emission - line galaxies covering of order 1000 deg@xmath19 of equatorial sky .",
    "analysis of the full dataset is ongoing . in this paper",
    "we report intermediate results for a subset of the wigglez sample with effective redshift @xmath27 .",
    "baos are a signature present in the 2-point clustering of galaxies . in this paper",
    "we analyze this signature using a variety of techniques : the 2-point correlation function , the power spectrum , and the band - filtered estimator recently proposed by xu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) which amounts to a band - filtered correlation function . quantifying the bao measurement using this range of techniques increases the robustness of our results and gives us a sense of the amplitude of systematic errors induced by our current methodologies . using each of these techniques we measure the angle - averaged clustering statistic , making no attempt to separate the tangential and radial components of the signal .",
    "therefore we measure the `` dilation scale '' distance @xmath28 introduced by eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) which consists of two parts physical angular - diameter distance , @xmath29 , and one part radial proper - distance , @xmath30 : @xmath31^{1/3 } .",
    "\\label{eqdv}\\ ] ] this distance measure reflects the relative importance of the tangential and radial modes in the angle - averaged bao measurement ( padmanabhan & white 2008 ) , and reduces to proper distance in the low - redshift limit . given that a measurement of @xmath28 is correlated with the physical matter density @xmath32 which controls the standard ruler scale , we extract other distilled parameters which are far less significantly correlated with @xmath32 , namely : the acoustic parameter @xmath3 as introduced by eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; the ratio @xmath33 , which quantifies the distance scale in units of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch , @xmath34 ; and @xmath35 which is the ratio between @xmath28 and the distance to the cmb last - scattering surface .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the wigglez data sample is introduced in section [ secdata ] , and we then present our measurements of the galaxy correlation function , power spectrum and band - filtered correlation function in sections [ secxi ] , [ secpk ] and [ secxu ] , respectively .",
    "the results of these different methodologies are compared in section [ seccomp ] . in section [ secdist ]",
    "we state our measurements of the bao distance scale at @xmath0 using various distilled parameters , and combine our result with other cosmological datasets in section [ seccosmofit ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a fiducial cosmological model which is a flat @xmath9cdm universe with matter density parameter @xmath36 , baryon fraction @xmath37 , hubble parameter @xmath38 , primordial index of scalar perturbations @xmath39 and redshift - zero normalization @xmath40 .",
    "this fiducial model is used for some of the intermediate steps in our analysis but our final cosmological constraints are , to first - order at least , independent of the choice of fiducial model .",
    "the wigglez dark energy survey at the anglo australian telescope ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2010 ) is a large - scale galaxy redshift survey of bright emission - line galaxies mapping a cosmic volume of order 1 gpc@xmath16 over the redshift interval @xmath41 .",
    "the survey has obtained of order @xmath26 redshifts for uv - selected galaxies covering of order 1000 deg@xmath19 of equatorial sky . in this paper",
    "we analyze the subset of the wigglez sample assembled up to the end of the 10a semester ( may 2010 ) .",
    "we include data from six survey regions in the redshift range @xmath42  the 9-hr , 11-hr , 15-hr , 22-hr , 1-hr and 3-hr regions  which together constitute a total sample of @xmath43 galaxies .",
    "the redshift probability distributions of the galaxies in each region are shown in figure [ fignz ] .",
    "the selection function for each survey region was determined using the methods described by blake et al .",
    "( 2010 ) which model effects due to the survey boundaries , incompleteness in the parent uv and optical catalogues , incompleteness in the spectroscopic follow - up , systematic variations in the spectroscopic redshift completeness across the aaomega spectrograph , and variations of the galaxy redshift distribution with angular position .",
    "the modelling process produces a series of monte carlo random realizations of the angle / redshift catalogue in each region , which are used in the correlation function estimation . by stacking together a very large number of these random realizations we deduced the 3d window function grid used for power spectrum estimation",
    "the 2-point correlation function is a common method for quantifying the clustering of a population of galaxies , in which the distribution of pair separations in the dataset is compared to that within random , unclustered catalogues possessing the same selection function ( peebles 1980 ) . in the context of measuring baryon acoustic oscillations ,",
    "the correlation function has the advantage that the expected signal of a preferred clustering scale is confined to a single , narrow range of separations around @xmath44 mpc .",
    "furthermore , small - scale non - linear effects , such as the distribution of galaxies within dark matter haloes , do not influence the correlation function on these large scales .",
    "one disadvantage of this statistic is that measurements of the large - scale correlation function are prone to systematic error because they are very sensitive to the unknown mean density of the galaxy population .",
    "however , such `` integral constraint '' effects result in a roughly constant offset in the large - scale correlation function , which does not introduce a preferred scale that could mimic the bao signature .    in order to estimate the correlation function of each wigglez survey region we first placed the angle / redshift catalogues for the data and random sets on a grid of co - moving co - ordinates , assuming a flat @xmath9cdm model with matter density @xmath45 .",
    "we then measured the redshift - space 2-point correlation function @xmath46 for each region using the landy - szalay ( 1993 ) estimator : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the data - data , data - random and random - random weighted pair counts in separation bin @xmath51 , each random catalogue containing the same number of galaxies as the real dataset . in the construction of the pair",
    "counts each data or random galaxy @xmath52 is assigned a weight @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the survey number density [ in @xmath55 mpc@xmath56 at the location of the @xmath52th galaxy , and @xmath57 mpc@xmath16 is a characteristic power spectrum amplitude at the scales of interest .",
    "the survey number density distribution is established by averaging over a large ensemble of random catalogues .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 pair counts are determined by averaging over 10 random catalogues .",
    "we measured the correlation function in 20 separation bins of width @xmath60 mpc between @xmath61 and @xmath62 mpc , and determined the covariance matrix of this measurement using lognormal survey realizations as described below .",
    "we combined the correlation function measurements in each bin for the different survey regions using inverse - variance weighting of each measurement ( we note that this procedure produces an almost identical result to combining the individual pair counts ) .    the combined correlation function is plotted in figure [ figxifit ] and shows clear evidence for the baryon acoustic peak at separation @xmath63 mpc .",
    "the effective redshift @xmath64 of the correlation function measurement is the weighted mean redshift of the galaxy pairs entering the calculation , where the redshift of a pair is simply the average @xmath65 , and the weighting is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is defined above .",
    "we determined @xmath64 for the bin @xmath68 mpc , although it does not vary significantly with separation .",
    "for the combined wigglez survey measurement , we found @xmath69 .",
    "we note that the correlation function measurements are corrected for the effect of redshift blunders in the wigglez data catalogue .",
    "these are fully quantified in section 3.2 of blake et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and can be well - approximated by a scale - independent boost to the correlation function amplitude of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the redshift blunder fraction ( which is separately measured for each wigglez region ) .",
    "we determined the covariance matrix of the correlation function measurement in each survey region using a large set of lognormal realizations .",
    "jack - knife errors , implemented by dividing the survey volume into many sub - regions , are a poor approximation for the error in the large - scale correlation function because the pair separations of interest are usually comparable to the size of the sub - regions , which are then not strictly independent . furthermore , because the wigglez dataset is not volume - limited and the galaxy number density varies with position , it is impossible to define a set of sub - regions which are strictly equivalent .",
    "lognormal realizations are relatively cheap to generate and provide a reasonably accurate galaxy clustering model for the linear and quasi - linear scales which are important for the modelling of baryon oscillations ( coles & jones 1991 ) .",
    "we generated a set of realizations for each survey region using the method described in blake & glazebrook ( 2003 ) and glazebrook & blake ( 2005 ) .",
    "in brief , we started with a model galaxy power spectrum @xmath72 consistent with the survey measurement .",
    "we then constructed gaussian realizations of overdensity fields @xmath73 sampled from a second power spectrum @xmath74 ( defined below ) , in which real and imaginary fourier amplitudes are drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath75 .",

    "the galaxy catalogue is then poisson - sampled in cells from the density field @xmath80 .",
    "we note that the input power spectrum for the gaussian overdensity field , @xmath81 , is constructed to ensure that the final power spectrum of the lognormal overdensity field is consistent with @xmath82 .",
    "this is achieved using the relation between the correlation functions of gaussian and lognormal fields , @xmath83}$ ] .",
    "we determined the covariance matrix between bins @xmath52 and @xmath84 using the correlation function measurements from a large ensemble of lognormal realizations : @xmath85 where the angled brackets indicate an average over the realizations .",
    "figure [ figxicov ] displays the final covariance matrix resulting from combining the different wigglez survey regions in the form of a correlation matrix @xmath86 .",
    "the magnitude of the first and second off - diagonal elements of the correlation matrix is typically @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "we find that the jack - knife errors on scales of @xmath89 mpc typically exceed the lognormal errors by a factor of @xmath90 , which we can attribute to an over - estimation of the number of independent jack - knife regions .      in this section",
    "we discuss the construction of the template fiducial correlation function model @xmath91 which we fitted to the wigglez measurement .",
    "when fitting the model we vary a scale distortion parameter @xmath92 , a linear normalization factor @xmath93 and the matter density @xmath32 which controls both the overall shape of the correlation function and the standard ruler sound horizon scale .",
    "hence we fitted the model @xmath94 the probability distribution of the scale distortion parameter @xmath92 , after marginalizing over @xmath32 and @xmath93 , gives the probability distribution of the distance variable @xmath95 where @xmath96 for our sample ( eisenstein et al .",

    "this yields a result in good agreement with a camb linear power spectrum ( lewis , challinor & lasenby 2000 ) , and also produces a wiggle - free reference spectrum @xmath105 which possesses the same shape as @xmath104 but with the baryon oscillation component deleted .",
    "this reference spectrum is useful for assessing the statistical significance with which we have detected the acoustic peak .",
    "we fixed the values of the other cosmological parameters using our fiducial model @xmath38 , @xmath106 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "our choices for these parameters are consistent with the latest fits to the cosmic microwave background radiation ( komatsu et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we then corrected the power spectrum for quasi - linear effects .",
    "there are two main aspects to the model : a damping of the acoustic peak caused by the displacement of matter due to bulk flows , and a distortion in the overall shape of the clustering pattern due to the scale - dependent growth of structure ( eisenstein , seo & white 2007 , crocce & scoccimarro 2008 , matsubara 2008 ) .",
    "we constructed our model in a similar manner to eisenstein et al .",

    "we checked that this value was consistent with the allowed range when @xmath113 was varied as a free parameter and fitted to the data .",
    "next , we incorporated the non - linear boost to the clustering power using the fitting formula of smith et al .",
    "however , we calculated the non - linear enhancement of power using the input no - wiggles reference spectrum rather than the full linear model including baryon oscillations : @xmath114 equation [ eqpkdamp2 ] is then transformed into a correlation function @xmath115 using equation [ eqpktoxi ] .",
    "the final component of our model is a scale - dependent galaxy bias term @xmath116 relating the galaxy correlation function appearing in equation [ eqximod ] to the non - linear matter correlation function : @xmath117 where we note that an overall constant normalization @xmath93 has already been separated in equation [ eqximod ] so that @xmath118 at large @xmath51 .",

    "in this section we present cosmological parameter fits to the distilled bao parameters measured above .",

    "the first version is the standard @xmath9cdm model in which dark energy is a cosmological constant with equation - of - state @xmath163 and spatial curvature is a free parameter ; we fit for @xmath164 and the cosmological constant density @xmath165 .",
    "the second version is the flat @xmath11cdm model in which spatial curvature is fixed at @xmath166 but the equation of state of dark energy is a free parameter ; we fit for @xmath164 and @xmath11 .    unless otherwise stated , we fitted these cosmological models to the wigglez measurement of @xmath167 combined with the measurements of @xmath168 from lrg samples at @xmath169 and @xmath170 ( percival et al .",
    "the distilled parameter @xmath3 ( measured from the galaxy correlation function ) is the most appropriate choice for quantifying the wigglez bao measurement because it is uncorrelated with @xmath32 , as demonstrated by figure [ figproba ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath168 provides the best representation of the percival et al .",
    "( 2010 ) bao data , because the shape of the clustering pattern was marginalized over in that analysis .                  as a first step in the cosmological analysis we considered the constraints on cosmological parameters obtained using bao data alone .",
    "two of the distilled parameters allow the derivation of cosmological constraints based on only bao measurements : the ratio of @xmath28 measurements and the acoustic parameter , @xmath3 .    ratios of @xmath28 measurements are of particularly interest because they provide constraints on the cosmic expansion history using geometric information alone , independent of the shape of the clustering pattern and the absolute scale of the standard ruler .",

    "the single available distance ratio @xmath171 provided relatively weak constraints on cosmological parameters and , in particular , could not confirm the acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the addition of the second distance ratio based on wigglez data , @xmath172 , significantly improves these constraints . for the first time , purely geometric distance ratios from bao measurements demonstrate that the cosmic expansion is accelerating : assuming the flat @xmath11cdm model , a dark energy fluid with @xmath12 is required with a likelihood of @xmath13 ( assuming the flat prior @xmath173 ) .",
    "the improvement in the @xmath130 statistic comparing the best - fitting @xmath9cdm model @xmath174 to the einstein de - sitter model @xmath175 is @xmath176 , whilst comparing the best - fitting @xmath9cdm model to the open cdm model @xmath177 we obtain @xmath178 .",
    "even given the extra parameter in the @xmath9cdm model , information criteria tests consider this level of improvement in @xmath130 to be significant evidence in favour of the @xmath9cdm model compared to a model with no dark energy .    following the addition of the wigglez measurement , the bao data alone require accelerating cosmic expansion with a higher level of statistical confidence than the initial luminosity distance measurements from supernovae that are considered to be the first direct evidence of accelerating expansion ( compare the left - hand panel of figure [ figdvdv ] with figure 6 of riess et al .",
    "although these bao measurements are not yet competitive with the latest supernova constraints , it is nevertheless reassuring that a standard - ruler measurement of the expansion of the universe , subject to an entirely different set of potential systematic uncertainties , produces a result in agreement with the standard - candle measurement .",
    "the cosmological constraints from the acoustic parameter @xmath3 are much more constraining than the @xmath28 ratios because they implicitly incorporate a model for the clustering pattern and standard ruler scale as a function of @xmath32 .",

    "the best - fitting parameter values based on lss data alone are offset by slightly more than one standard deviation from the best - fitting parameter values of the combined lss+cmb+sn fit .",

    "( 2007 ) measurement of baos in the sdss : the lss measurements prefer a slightly higher rate of acceleration , or a more negative equation of state of dark energy . the new wigglez results reported here",
    "serve to amplify that tension , although the level of discrepancy is not statistically significant .    in order to investigate whether more complex models give a better statistical fit to these datasets we performed fits of two additional cosmological models .",
    "the first is a @xmath11cdm model in which we allow curvature to be a free parameter ; i.e.  we fit for @xmath164 , @xmath199 and @xmath11 .",
    "the second is a @xmath200cdm model in which the equation - of - state of dark energy is allowed to vary linearly with scale factor ( cpl parameterization ; chevallier & polarski 2001 , linder 2003 ) ; i.e.  we fit for @xmath164 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 .",
    "if these additional parameters are justified we should find that the minimum value of the @xmath130 statistic decreases significantly .",
    "however , we in fact find that the addition of the extra degrees of freedom improves the @xmath130 value of the best - fitting model by at most @xmath203 compared to the @xmath9cdm model , and significantly degrades the errors in our fitted parameters .",

    "we show that our results are not sensitive to the details of the quasi - linear model by comparing five different implementations suggested in the literature .",
    "we use the gigglez n - body simulation to demonstrate that scale - dependent bias effects in the wigglez galaxy distribution have an amplitude of @xmath206 on @xmath60 mpc scales , compared to @xmath207 for more highly - biased lrgs . *",
    "we measured the distance - redshift relation @xmath139 with an accuracy of about @xmath208 using the scale dilation method .",
    "the self - consistency of the measurement amongst the independent clustering statistics suggests that systematic measurement errors are not dominating these results .",
    "our data best constrain the quantity @xmath209 , which lies perpendicular to the principal degeneracy direction of our contours and which is measured with an accuracy of @xmath210 : we find @xmath211 . * the distance ratios between our measurements and previous analyses of the luminous red galaxy distribution at redshifts @xmath7 and @xmath8 are consistent with a flat @xmath9cdm cosmological model which also provides a good fit to the cmb distance priors .",
    "addition of the wigglez data allows us to establish , using geometric distance ratios alone , that the equation - of - state of dark energy drives an accelerating expansion ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 likelihood , assuming a flat prior @xmath212 .",
    "the current wigglez dataset delivers an improvement of about @xmath181 in the measurement of @xmath165 and @xmath182 in the measurement of @xmath11 , based on bao data alone .",
