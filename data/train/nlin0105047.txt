    "chaotic behavior in classical hamiltonian systems manifests itself in an infinite hierarchy of phase - space structures and instability of trajectories with respect to small changes in their initial condition .",
    "if resolution in phase space is restricted , e.g. due to finite precision of measurements , phase - space trajectories can be followed only approximately .",
    "every finite - resolution initial condition actually stands for an entire ensemble of trajectories with possibly very different long - time behaviors .",
    "that fact suggests a probabilistic approach to the dynamics , in which a phase - space density and its propagator @xmath0 , the so called frobenius - perron operator , are studied .    because of liouville s theorem @xmath0 can be represented by an infinite unitary matrix in a hilbert space of phase - space functions .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 thus lies on the unit circle in the complex plane .",
    "discrete eigenvalues represent regular dynamics , while chaos entails a continuous spectrum , and along with the latter resonances of @xmath0 may occur that characterize effectively irreversible behavior@xcite . apart from their role as decay rates , frobenius - perron resonances have been found to link classical with quantum dynamics because they could as well be identified from quantum systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have been predicted to carry information on the system - specific corrections to universality of quantum fluctuations@xcite .    to identify resonances , mathematically defined as singularities of the resolvent of @xmath0 in some higher riemannian sheet , it is necessary to analytically continue the resolvent across the continuous spectrum of @xmath0 from the outside to the inside of the unit circle @xcite .",
    "this becomes increasingly difficult as the dynamics gains complexity .",
    "especially for the large class of systems with a mixed phase space an effective approximation scheme is needed that is free of restrictions of previous investigations @xcite , such as hyperbolicity , one - dimensional ( quasi- ) phase space , or isolation of the phase - space regions causing intermittency .    in the following",
    "we present such a scheme and illustrate it for a prototypical dynamical system with a mixed phase space , a periodically kicked top .",
    "we represent @xmath0 in a hilbert space of phase - space functions as an infinite unitary matrix and subsequently truncate it to a finite @xmath2-dimensional matrix @xmath3 , with resolution in phase space as the truncation criterion .",
    "we thus generate a nonunitary approximation to the unitary @xmath0 that becomes exact as @xmath4 .",
    "looking at the spectra of @xmath3 with increasing @xmath2 , we find some eigenvalues persisting in their positions , either almost on the unit circle or well inside , and we focus on these `` frozen '' eigenvalues . while frozen ( near)unimodular eigenvalues of @xmath3 turn into unimodular eigenvalues of @xmath0 as @xmath4 , the nonunimodular frozen eigenvalues are not part of the spectrum of @xmath0 in that limit .",
    "we will argue that at finite but large @xmath2 they rather indicate the positions of resonances of @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , the eigenfunctions of @xmath3 are of very different nature for these two cases .",
    "we find eigenfunctions to unimodular eigenvalues localized and approximately constant on islands of regular motion in phase space that are bounded by invariant tori .",
    "in contrast , eigenfunctions to nonunimodular eigenvalues of @xmath5 are localized near unstable manifolds of hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
    "just as nonunimodular eigenvalues are not in the spectrum of the hilbert - space operator @xmath0 , the eigenfunctions are no hilbert - space functions in the limit of infinite resolution .",
    "a comparison of the eigenfunctions of @xmath3 for different values of @xmath2 and furthermore with the eigenfunctions of the truncated inverse operator @xmath6 illustrates why they lie outside the hilbert space .",
    "the strong localization of these ( resonance-)eigenfunctions at finite @xmath2 allows us to identify the relatively few groups of periodic orbits associated with a particular resonance up to a certain length . from only these orbits",
    "we recover resonances via a variant of the so - called cycle expansion of periodic - orbit theory that works even in the case of a mixed phase space . to verify that frozen eigenvalues have indeed the physical interpretation of resonances , we conclude with a numerical experiment in which the decay of a two - point correlation function is observed . in order to find a certain resonance responsible for correlation decay ,",
    "the initial phase - space density is chosen localized in the phase - space region where the resonance - eigenfunction has large amplitudes .",
    "a short account of the results to be discussed here has been published recently @xcite .",
    "as a prototypical hamiltonian system with a phase space displaying a mix of chaotic and regular behavior we consider a periodically kicked angular momentum vector @xmath7 of conserved length @xmath8 , also known as the kicked top @xcite .",
    "such a system has one degree of freedom , and its phase space is a sphere .",
    "a phase - space point @xmath9 may be characterized by an `` azimutal '' angle @xmath10 as the coordinate @xmath11 and the cosine of a `` polar '' angle @xmath12 as the conjugate momentum @xmath13 .",
    "the dynamics is specified as a stroboscopic area preserving map , @xmath14 .",
    "we chose @xmath15 to consist of rotations @xmath16 about the @xmath17- and @xmath18-axes and a `` torsion '' , i.e. a nonlinear rotation @xmath19 about the @xmath18-axis which changes @xmath10 by @xmath20 , @xmath21 in the sequel we keep @xmath22 fixed and vary the torsion constant @xmath23 to generate a phase space which is integrable for @xmath24 and increasingly dominated by chaos as @xmath23 grows .",
    "we focus on @xmath25 as a moderately chaotic case and @xmath26 as strongly chaotic ( see figures [ figure1]a , b ) , where elliptic islands have become so small that they are difficult to detect .    in the liouville picture",
    "the time evolution of a phase - space density @xmath27 is governed by liouville s equation , @xmath28 where the liouville operator @xmath29 , the poisson bracket with the hamiltonian @xmath30 , appears as generator . for our rotations and",

    "the additional structure of the hilbert space can be exploited to represent @xmath0 by an infinite unitary matrix , the unitarity @xmath43 following from ( [ eq4 ] ) and area preservation in the map @xmath15 .",
    "the basis functions may be chosen as ordered with respect to phase - space resolution .",
    "this allows us to eventually truncate @xmath0 to finite size and still retain the propagator intact for functions on large phase - space scales .    on",
    "the unit sphere the spherical harmonics @xmath44 with @xmath45 and integer @xmath46 form a suitable basis .",
    "phase - space resolution is characterized by the index @xmath47 : using all @xmath48 with @xmath49 phase - space structures of area @xmath50 can be resolved , and the number of these basis functions is @xmath51 .    to check on the resolution achievable by spherical harmonics",
    "consider a gaussian @xmath52 with the angular widths @xmath53 and the effective area @xmath54 . to represent it by a linear combination of spherical harmonics",
    "we need only the @xmath48 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; all other spherical harmonics have negligible scalar product with @xmath57 .",

    "inverting that statement we may say that a basis set of spherical harmonics cut off at a certain @xmath65 is suitable for representing objects on the unit sphere with the angular sizes @xmath66 and area @xmath67 .    to obtain the matrix elements @xmath68 \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] for the mixed dynamics it is convenient to first determine the frobenius - perron matrices for the two rotations @xmath69 and the torsion @xmath70 , all of which are by themselves integrable and free of chaos . deferring the derivation to appendix a we here",
    "just note the three matrices .",
    "the frobenius - perron matrix of the @xmath18- rotation is diagonal , @xmath71 for the @xmath17-rotation , @xmath72 is blockdiagonal in @xmath47 with the blocks well known from quantum mechanics as wigner s @xmath73-matrices , @xmath74 for the @xmath18-torsion the frobenius - perron matrix elements are given by finite sums over products of spherical bessel functions @xmath75 and clebsch - gordan coefficients , @xmath76 finally , for the mixed dynamics @xmath0 is the product of the three above matrices . due to the kronecker deltas involved ,",
    "each element of @xmath0 is just the product of three matrix elements , one each for the rotations and the torsion .",
    "obviously , @xmath0 is a full matrix coupling all phase - space scales , as it is to be expected for chaotic dynamics .",
    "we furthermore remark that with respect to the real basis @xmath77 the matrix @xmath0 is also real , since real phase - space densities can not become complex under time evolution . as a consequence ,",
    "all eigenvalues of @xmath3 are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "to study resonances and ( discrete ) eigenvalues of @xmath0 we investigate the finite - size approximants @xmath3 for different values of @xmath2 , i.e. different resolutions in phase space . in the low - resolution subspace spanned by the first @xmath2 basis functions @xmath3 replaces @xmath0 identically , but it completely rejects fine phase - space structures that can not be expanded in terms of these @xmath2 functions .",
    "the truncation of @xmath0 to finite size breaks unitarity .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 may not only have unimodular eigenvalues but also eigenvalues located inside the unit circle . furthermore , the spectrum of @xmath3 is purely discrete .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of the eigenvalues of @xmath3 yields information on the spectral properties of @xmath0 . upon diagonalizing @xmath3 and increasing @xmath2",
    "we find the `` newly born '' eigenvalues close to the origin while the `` older '' ones move about in the complex plane .",
    "`` very old '' ones eventually settle for good . if the classical dynamics is integrable ( @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) , the asymptotic large-@xmath2 loci are back to the unit circle , where the full @xmath0 has its discrete eigenvalues .",
    "the situation is different for the mixed phase space : while some eigenvalues of @xmath3 `` freeze '' with unit moduli , others come to rest inside the unit circle as @xmath80 .",
    "these eigenvalues reflect resonances of @xmath0 in a higher riemannian sheet of the complex plane .",
    "we see this phenomenon as analogous to the spectral concentration in perturbation theory @xcite : a perturbation series for an operator with continuous spectrum does not converge but produces , with increasing order , a sequence of points concentrated in the neighborhood of the respective resonance .",
    "an additional intuitive argument for the persistence of non - unimodular eigenvalues as @xmath4 for nonintegrable dynamics is the following : in contrast to regular motion , chaos comes with a hierarchy of phase - space structures which extends without end to ever finer scales .",
    "probability that is propagated from large to fine scales mostly does not return .",
    "this effectively dissipative character of the conservative dynamics is accounted for as true dissipation by the truncated propagator and its nonunimodular eigenvalues , but the difference between effective and true dissipation is irrelevant for low resolution .",
    "moreover , a frozen nonunimodular eigenvalue is to be understood as a scale - independent dissipation rate , in tune with the expected selfsimilarity in phase space .",
    "the freezing of non - unimodular eigenvalues is illustrated for two kicked tops , one with weakly chaotic @xmath81 and one with strongly chaotic character @xmath82 .",
    "figures [ figure1]a and [ figure1]b show the respective phase - space portraits . while for @xmath25 large islands of regular motion still exist , for @xmath83 regular islands have become so small that they are difficult to detect and impossible to resolve with @xmath84 .",
    "figures [ figure2]a and [ figure2]b show grey - shade coded histograms in the complex plane for the number of eigenvalues with moduli larger than @xmath85 of all matrices with @xmath86 .",
    "eigenvalues with moduli smaller than @xmath85 are rejected because they have not settled yet and their density near the origin is so high that they would spoil the histogram .",
    "large amplitudes ( black ) in the histograms indicate the positions of frozen eigenvalues .",
    "while for @xmath87 a large number of frozen eigenvalues is found close to the unit circle , in the case @xmath88 , where no regular islands can be resolved , the only unimodular eigenvalue is the one at unity which pertains to the stationary uniform eigenfunction @xmath89 ; all other frozen eigenvalues lie well inside the unit circle and indicate resonance positions .",
    "table [ tablea ] lists some of these frozen nonunimodular eigenvalues at resolutions @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    at first sight",
    "the two cases presented above may appear to correspond to quite different types of dynamics , but actually this is only a matter of resolution . as resolution",
    "is further increased in the strongly chaotic case @xmath82 , elliptic islands will be resolved at some stage .",
    "correspondingly , eigenvalues of @xmath3 will emerge which freeze on the unit circle .",
    "also new nonunimodular frozen eigenvalues may appear , possibly even ones larger in modulus than the frozen eigenvalues found at lower resolution .",
    "an investigation of the eigenfunctions of @xmath3 reveals more about the nature of the frozen eigenvalues .",
    "eigenvalues freezing with unit moduli have eigenfunctions located on elliptic islands of regular motion surrounding elliptic periodic orbits in phase space .",
    "such islands are bounded by invariant tori which form impenetrable barriers in phase space .",
    "thus if @xmath92 is a characteristic function constant on an island around the @xmath93th point of an @xmath13-periodic orbit and zero outside with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , then @xmath96 is an eigenfunction of @xmath0 with eigenvalue unity .",
    "moreover , linear combinations of such functions are eigenfunctions as well .",
    "figures [ figure3]a , b show two eigenfunctions of @xmath5 with eigenvalues @xmath97 and @xmath98 almost at unity for the kicked top with @xmath25 and @xmath99 .",
    "amplitudes of the functions are large in dark shaded areas of phase space .",
    "the elliptic islands supporting the eigenfunctions can easily be identified in the phase - space portrait in figure [ figure1]a .    for @xmath100",
    "we furthermore expect and find the @xmath13th roots of unity as eigenvalues as well with eigenfunctions that have constant moduli on elliptic islands and are invariant under @xmath101 , @xmath102 superpositions of two such @xmath103 are also eigenfunctions if @xmath104 , i.e. if all periods @xmath105 involved are multiples of @xmath13 ; the possible phases are dictated by the shortest period @xmath13 .",
    "once freezing has been observed for eigenvalues with moduli smaller than unity their eigenfunctions have approached their final shape on the resolved phase - space scales .",
    "in contrast to the eigenfunctions with unimodular eigenvalues these eigenfunctions are localized around unstable manifolds of hyperbolic periodic orbits , ones with low periods at first since these are easiest to resolve .",
    "[ typically , for every period several neighbouring orbits of approximately equal instability can be identified in an eigenfunction , their number being the larger the more extended the eigenfunction . ]",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows moduli of eigenfunctions for some of the nonunimodular eigenvalues listed in table [ tablea ] at resolution @xmath106 . particularly in figures [ figure4]b ,",
    "c the localization on orbits of length six and four respectively is obvious . with growing @xmath107 more orbits of higher periods appear in the eigenfunction .",
    "their supports gain complexity , in correspondence with the infinitely convoluted shape of the unstable manifolds . just as for the eigenvalues",
    "there is no strict convergence of the eigenfunctions . since no finite approximation @xmath3 accounts for arbitrarily fine structures one encounters the aforementioned loss of probability from resolved to unresolved scales . not even in the limit @xmath4",
    "can the unitarity of @xmath0 be restored : rather , in tune with a continuous spectrum of @xmath108 , the eigenfunctions tend to singular objects outside the hilbert space .",
    "this becomes even more obvious in a comparison of eigenfunctions of @xmath3 with eigenfunctions of the truncated inverse propagator @xmath6 .",
    "both matrices have the same frozen eigenvalues , but only for the unimodular ones eigenfunctions of @xmath3 and @xmath6 to the same eigenvalue have ( roughly ) the same support , as it is expected for unitary dynamics : the elliptic islands that support the eigenfunctions are invariant under time reversal . for nonunimodular frozen eigenvalues eigenfunctions of @xmath3 and @xmath6",
    "have distinct supports .",
    "while unstable periodic orbits are traversed in the opposite direction but remain the same under time reversal , stable and unstable manifolds are interchanged .",
    "thus the eigenfunctions of @xmath6 are localized near the same periodic orbits but around the stable manifolds of the forward - dynamics .",
    "in particular the eigenfunctions do not converge to the same limit as @xmath4 .",
    "needless to say this again reflects the effective irreversibility of the chaotic hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "figures [ figure5 ] and [ figure6 ] illustrate the aforesaid .",
    "the eigenfunction in figure [ figure5]a at resolution @xmath109 corresponds to the same frozen eigenvalue as the eigenfunction in figure [ figure5]b at resolution @xmath110 .",
    "while coarse structures are the same in both eigenfunctions , more fine structures appear at the higher resolution .",
    "figure [ figure5]c shows , again for the same eigenvalue , the eigenfunction of @xmath6 at @xmath110 . in contrast to figure [ figure5]b localization is now on the stable manifolds of the same periodic orbits of the foreward dynamics .",
    "these periodic orbits as well as their unstable and stable manifolds are shown in figure [ figure6 ] .    just like the unimodular eigenvalues ,",
    "frozen eigenvalues inside the unit circle come in @xmath13-families , i.e. with phases corresponding to the @xmath13th roots of unity , determined by the length @xmath13 of the shortest periodic orbit present in an eigenfunction .",
    "now the above argument must be modified in the following way : assume an eigenfunction @xmath111 is mostly concentrated around a shortest unstable orbit with period @xmath13 as well as a longer one with period @xmath105 .",
    "denote by @xmath112 again a `` characteristic function '' , now constant near the @xmath93-th point of the period@xmath113 orbit , @xmath114 , and zero elsewhere .",
    "the truncated frobenius - perron operator @xmath3 maps @xmath112 into @xmath115 with the real positive factor @xmath116 smaller than unity accounting for losses , in particular to unresolved scales . as previously",
    ", independent linear combinations of the @xmath112 can be formed as @xmath117 now consider a sum of two such functions , @xmath118 , and apply @xmath3 . for @xmath119 to qualify as an approximate eigenfunction we must obviously have @xmath120 , i.e. the two periodic orbits must be similarly unstable , and @xmath121 .",
    "but then indeed @xmath122 and @xmath123^pg\\approx r_p^pg$ ] , and the phase is dictated by the shortest orbit . since orbits of low period are most likely to be resolved first , usually the first frozen eigenvalues found from diagonalizing @xmath3 have phases corresponding to small numbers @xmath13 .",
    "since nonunimodular eigenvalues with phases according to @xmath124 have already been presented in @xcite , in this paper we intentionally chose @xmath125 , a case for which eigenvalues with other phases happen to be more easily detected . in figure [ figure2]b and table [ tablea ] complex eigenvalues with phases near the sixth roots of unity are clearly visible .",
    "since the unstable periodic orbits that are linked to a nonunimodular eigenvalue can be identified quite easily from the eigenfunction of @xmath3 , one is tempted to adopt a cycle expansion to calculate decay rates from periodic orbits .    for purely hyperbolic systems , cycle expansions of the spectral determinant ,",
    "i.e. the characteristic polynomial of the frobenius - perron operator @xmath126 are known to allow for the calculation of resonances with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "the spectral determinant is expressed in terms of the traces of the frobenius - perron operator @xmath127 as @xmath128 and subsequently expanded as a finite polynomial up to some order @xmath129 .",
    "only the first @xmath129 traces are required for the calculation of this polynomial , and only periodic orbits with primitive periods up to @xmath129 contribute to it .",
    "the traces @xmath130 are calculated as sums over hyperbolic periodic orbits of length @xmath93 as @xmath131 where the matrix @xmath132 is the linearized version of the map @xmath133 evaluated at any of the points of a period@xmath134 orbit . if @xmath93 is the @xmath135-fold of a primitive period @xmath13 , the matrix @xmath136 can as well be written as @xmath137 , and the spectral determinant as a product of contributions from all primitive orbits @xmath138 , @xmath139 \\,.\\ ] ] the zeros @xmath140 of the polynomial which are insensitive against an increase of @xmath129 are inverses of resonances .",
    "for the ordinary cycle expansion of a spectral determinant just sketched to converge , all periodic orbits must be hyperbolic and sufficiently unstable @xcite .",
    "these conditions are not met for a mixed phase space , not only because of the presence of elliptic orbits but also because of very weakly unstable orbits with high periods .",
    "we can circumvent such limitations by considering only one ergodic region in phase space at a time , bar contributions from elliptic orbits , and impose a stability bound by including only the relatively few , about equally unstable hyperbolic orbits @xmath141 identified in an eigenfunction of @xmath3 .",
    "we surmize that the spectral determinant factors as @xmath142 with one factor @xmath143 for the family @xmath141 of periodic orbits showing up in the @xmath144th eigenfunction .",
    "each such factor @xmath145 is then calculated separately with the above expressions .",
    "obviously this variant of the cycle expansion reproduces the phases of the resonances exactly since these are again directly determined by lengths of orbits : if @xmath13 is the smallest period used in @xmath145 , the polynomial can as well be written as a polynomial in @xmath146 thus allowing the zeros to have the phases of the @xmath13th roots of unity .",
    "needless to say , the notorious proliferation of periodic orbits with growing length causes more and more difficulties for the cycle expansion for @xmath13-families of resonances with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "we first turn to the top with @xmath147 . here , unstable orbits with periods 1,2 , and 4 and the corresponding @xmath13-families of resonances are easily detected . in table",
    "[ tableb ] frozen eigenvalues found at the resolution @xmath110 are listed in the first column .",
    "the columns to the right show the corresponding results of the cycle expansion up to order @xmath148 .",
    "the total number of orbits used in each case is given in curly brackets .",
    "for instance , our cycle expansion of the resonance @xmath149 involves three orbits of lengths @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the resonance @xmath153 as well as its phase - related partners @xmath154 can be approximately reproduced using four orbits of length @xmath152 . for the real positive eigenvalue @xmath155 ( not listed in table [ tableb ] ) completing this quartet of eigenvalues",
    "the eigenfunction is also localized in other regions of phase space and thus further orbits with periods different from @xmath156 would have to be included in the cycle expansion .",
    "the first repetition of the single period-2 orbit contributing to the resonance @xmath157 in table [ tableb ] gives an almost diverging contribution to the spectral determinant , thus hindering its expansion to a higher order .",
    "the top with @xmath88 offers itself for a study of complex frozen eigenvalues with phases near the fourth and sixth roots of unity .",
    "even though these two groups of eigenvalues are almost equal in modulus , the corresponding eigenfunctions are localized in different regions of phase space , and therefore the two examples turn out independent ( see figures [ figure4]b , c ) .",
    "the reason why we leave aside the eigenvalues on the real axis is that their eigenfunctions show localization on many orbits of different , higher periods which can not all be identified ( see figures [ figure4]a , d ) . for the resonances @xmath158 the spectral determinant of order @xmath159 , calculated from six periodic orbits of length @xmath152 , yields @xmath160 . in the next higher order @xmath161 another @xmath162 orbits of primitive length @xmath163 must be taken into account with the resulting approximants @xmath164 . for the resonances",
