    "<S> the thermodynamics of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice is revisited through a linearized spin - wave theory which is well defined at any finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we re - examine in details the temperature dependence of the free energy , the internal energy , the entropy and the specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> most conclusions of the thermodynamics in previous studies can be reproduced in our linearized spin - wave theory . </S>",
    "<S> specially , our calculation at low temperature @xmath0 agrees quantitatively with the numerical quantum monte carlo simulation and high temperature series expansions .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum magnets is one of the main subjects in the modern condensed matter physics , as they are closely related to the unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite and the novel quantum spin - liquid states in frustrated lattices.@xcite the previous studies are mainly concentrated in the low - energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> however , some interesting physics , such as the crossover behavior@xcite in 2d quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( qhafm ) and the pseudogap physics in the cuprates,@xcite occurs at high energy scales and are still in controversial . </S>",
    "<S> one reason for these controversies is the lack of a reliable theoretical formalism well - defined in full temperature region .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we proposed a perturbation spin - wave theory for the 2d qhafm on a square lattice.@xcite our theory is based upon takahashi s modified spin - wave theory , where in order to study the finite temperature disordered state , he introduced a constraint of the loss of the local moment.@xcite it is found that the 2d quantum antiferromagnet is well described at low temperatures by this modified spin - wave theory , yielding the results consistent to the other theories@xcite and numerical simulations.@xcite in the modified spin - wave theory , a mean - field ansatz is introduced to decouple the spin - wave interactions . </S>",
    "<S> although it gives a good description of the low - energy physics , it results in the failure of the theory at high temperatures @xmath1 , where an artificial phase transition occurs which obviously violates the mermin - wagner theorem.@xcite    in our perturbation spin - wave theory , the loss of the local moment is also included to fulfill the mermin - wagner theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections from the spin - wave interactions are studied via a many - body perturbation method , which removes the mean - field divergence in the modified spin - wave theory . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the uniform static susceptibility from our perturbation spin - wave theory agrees well with the quantum monte carlo simulations and high temperature series expansions.@xcite it shows that our theory is well - defined at any finite temperature and is a good formalism for the 2d qhafm . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it is found that even the linearized spin - wave theory with the spin - wave interactions neglected can reproduce the main features of the uniform static susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> thus it encourages us to use the linearized spin - wave theory , on its reliability and simplicity , to study the thermodynamical properties of 2d qhafm .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present our calculations of the thermodynamical variables of a qhafm on a square lattice , including the free energy , the internal energy , the entropy and the specific heat . comparing with the numerical simulations , </S>",

    "<S> the hamiltonian of a qhafm on a square lattice is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denotes nearest - neighbor sites . </S>",

    "<S> this lagrange hamiltonian fulfills the mermin - wagner theorem for the loss of the local magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to a finite gap in the spin - wave energy spectrum and thus the spin - wave excitations behave as bosons with finite mass at finite temperatures .    in our spin - wave theory , </S>",
    "<S> the spin operators are expressed by bosonic operators based upon the dyson - maleev representation,@xcite @xmath13for the spins in sublattice a and @xmath14 in sublattice b. with this spin representation , the hamiltonian @xmath15 can be expressed as summation of quadratic and quantic terms in these bosonic operators . in our following discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we will neglect the quantic terms which represent the spin - wave interactions and investigate the thermodynamics of qhafm within a linearized spin - wave theory . </S>",
