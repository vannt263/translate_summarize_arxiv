    "the key properties of nucleation processes in a supersaturated vapours are the height @xmath0 of the free energy barrier that must be overcome to form stable clusters and the nucleation rate @xmath1 that indicates how many macroscopic droplets emerge in a given volume per time .",
    "the most widespread approach for calculating these quantities is the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) @xcite , which has significant shortcomings , e.g. , it overestimates the free energy of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "an important problem of cnt in case of vapour to liquid nucleation is that the underlying basic assumptions for the liquid do not apply to nanoscopic clusters @xcite .",
    "molecular simulation permits the investigation of nanoscopic surface effects and the stability of supersaturated states from first principles , using effective pair potentials .",
    "for instance , the spinodal line can be detected with monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite simulation methods ; in experiments , it can only be approximated as it is impossible to discriminate an unstable state from a metastable state where @xmath0 is low .",
    "equilibria @xcite and vapourization processes @xcite of single clusters can also be simulated to obtain the surface tension as well as heat and mass transfer properties of strongly curved interfaces . moreover , molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite and mc @xcite simulation of supersaturated systems with a large number of particles are useful for the study of very fast nucleation processes , whereas lower nucleation rates can be calculated by transition path sampling based methods @xcite .",
    "equilibrium simulations fail to reproduce kinetic properties of nucleation processes such as the overheating of growing clusters due to latent heat . on the other hand",
    ", direct md simulation of nucleation , where cluster formation is observed directly in a near - spinodal supersaturated vapour , has its limits : if nucleation occurs too fast , it affects the properties of the vapour to a significant extent so that the nucleation rate obtained according to the method of yasuoka and matsumoto @xcite and other properties of the system vary over simulation time @xcite . in the present work , nucleation is studied as a steady - state process by combining grand canonical md ( gcmd ) and mcdonald s dmon @xcite , an that eliminates large droplets from the system .",
    "supersaturated states can be characterized in terms of the difference between the chemical potential @xmath2 of the vapour and the saturated chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "the chemical potential of the vapour can be regulated by simulating the grand canonical ensemble with gcmd : alternating with canonical ensemble md steps , particles are inserted into and deleted from the system probabilistically , with the usual grand canonical acceptance criterion @xcite . for a test insertion , random coordinates are chosen for an additional particle , and for a test deletion , a random particle is removed from the system . the potential energy difference @xmath4 due to the test action",
    "is determined and compared with the chemical potential .",
    "the acceptance probability for insertions is @xmath5           \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{v}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{\\lambda}}}^3({\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{n}}}+1 ) } \\right),\\ ] ] while for deletions it is @xmath6           \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{v}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{\\lambda}}}^3{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{n } } } } \\right),\\ ] ] wherein @xmath7 is the thermal wavelength .",
    "of course , care must be taken that the momentum of the inserted particles is consistent with the simulated ensemble and does not introduce any artifical velocity gradients .",
    "the md integration time step was @xmath8 = 0.00404 in reduced time units , i.e. , @xmath9 , wherein @xmath10 is the energy parameter of the fluid model and @xmath11 is the mass of a particle .",
    "the number of test actions per simulation time step was chosen between @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 , a value which was occasionally decreased after equilibration if very low nucleation rates were observed .",
    "molecular simulation of nucleation has to rely on a cluster criterion to distinguish the emerging liquid from the surrounding supersaturated vapour @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the stillinger criterion @xcite was used to define the liquid phase and clusters were determined as biconnected components . whenever a cluster exceeded the specified threshold size @xmath15 , an intervention of mcdonald s dmon removed it from the system , leaving a vacuum behind @xcite .",
    "the free energy of cluster formation is the same for the grand canonical and the isothermal - isobaric ensemble @xcite . at specified values of the chemical potential @xmath2 of the supersaturated vapour , the total system volume @xmath16 and the temperature @xmath17",
    ", it is related to the surface energy @xmath18 by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of particles in the cluster , @xmath21 is the supersaturated vapour pressure , @xmath22 is the volume and @xmath23 the surface area of a cluster containing @xmath20 particles .",
    "note that @xmath24 as well as @xmath25 are the chemical potential and the pressure of the liquid phase at the conditions prevailing inside the cluster . in cnt",
    ", it is assumed that the bulk liquid density at saturation @xmath26 and the density of a nanoscopic cluster are the same and all clusters are treated as spheres , i.e. , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . accordingly , the chemical potential of the liquid inside the nucleus is approximated by @xmath29 and the cluster surface tension @xmath30 by the surface tension @xmath31 of the planar vapour - liquid interface , leading to @xcite @xmath32{\\frac{2\\pi}{3{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{\\nu}}}}\\left(\\frac{4}{{{{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{\\rho}}}}'}}\\right)^2 }           + { { { \\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{\\mu}}}}_\\mathnormal{\\sigma}}({\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{t } } } ) - { \\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{\\mu}}}+ \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{p}}}- { { { \\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{p}}}}_\\mathnormal{\\sigma}}({\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{t}}})}{{{{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{\\rho } } } } ' } }                 \\right ] { \\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{d}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{\\nu}}}.\\ ] ] the free energy of formation has a maximum @xmath0 which lies at the size @xmath33 of the critical nucleus . including the zeldovi factor @xmath34 and the thermal non - accomodation factor @xmath35 of feder _ _ et al .  _ _",

    "instead of using the surface tension of the planar interface , laaksonen , ford , and kulmala ( lfk ) @xcite proposed an expression equivalent to @xmath39 the two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined from the assumption that almost all particles are arranged either as monomers or as dimers and that the fisher @xcite equation of state correctly relates @xmath42 to the number of monomers and clusters present per volume .",
    "effectively , lfk theory modifies cnt only by the introduction of the parameter @xmath40 , since @xmath41 cancels out for all free energy differences if the usual assumption @xmath43 is applied .",
