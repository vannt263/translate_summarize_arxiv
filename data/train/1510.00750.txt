    "quite interesting phenomena emerge from the nature of wave functions of the confined electrons , described by massless or massive dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite , instead of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the dirac equation is appropriate to describe the electronic states of two independent sub - lattice components @xcite , which generates additional constraints known as pseudo - spins .",
    "the prominent examples of these bipartite systems are square lattices , such as some topological insulators , and hexagonal lattices , whose main example are the graphene structures",
    ".    among the different electronic dirac devices , the chaotic dirac quantum dot ( dqd ) , also called chaotic dirac billiard ( db ) , has received a significant highlight@xcite , due to its universal characteristics . in the search for such universal properties , the ref .  [ ]",
    "studies experimentally a db using a graphene quantum dot .",
    "the authors study a small billiard and show level statistics distribution best described by gaussian unitary or orthogonal ensembles from the random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "moreover , the authors find evidences of a time reversal symmetry ( trs ) broken state in the absence of a magnetic field , raising questions about the possible origin of such states .",
    "in fact , almost thirty years ago , berry and mondragon @xcite , studied what they called  neutrino billiard \" , a stadium where massless spin-1/2 fermions , described by a dirac hamiltonian , are confined .",
    "they showed that the system exhibits time reversal symmetry ( trs ) breaking in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the statistics of the energy eigenvalues of the confined fermions were found to be governed by the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "quite recently , the dirac stadium was experimentally studied with the aid of microwave resonators in refs .",
    "@xcite . motivated by @xcite and other findings , ref .",
    "[ ] uses the tight - binding dirac hamiltonian model for electrons , taking into account massive confinement , to analyze the conductance and energy level statistics of graphene db . in the absence of massive confinement , the authors show that electronic properties are well described by gaussian unitary or orthogonal ensembles , as obtained in ref .",
    "however , in the presence of massive confinement , the transmission statistics follow exclusively from the block unitary structure , while the spectral statistics exhibits an orthogonal or even poisson statistics .",
    "analytical results for the chaotic graphene quantum dot ( with massive confinement ) were obtained using semiclassical theory in ref .",
    "in the limit of high massive confinement , the authors predict the average of conductance and the amplitude of the universal fluctuations as a function of magnetic flux and armchair edges .",
    "the authors also analyze how the ratio between the dwell time and the magnetic flux time ( @xmath0 ) as well as the ratio of the dwell time and armchair edges time ( @xmath1 ) affect the weak localization and universal fluctuations in the crossover regime and compare with standard results of the universal gaussian unitary and orthogonal ensembles .",
    "motivated by that semi - classical theory analysis , ref .",
    "[ ] performed a full analytical study of the dqd through the rmt chiral ensemble .",
    "the authors derived a general expression for the average conductance and its universal fluctuations for the three classes of chiral ensembles in the pure regime ( in the absence of crossover fields ) , which in the semi - classical limit ( large number of open channels ) recover the specific results of ref .",
    "[ ] that are outside the crossover regime .    as previously discussed , there is a theoretical challenge to construct an rmt formulation for the study of the dqd in any crossover regime ( finite field and/or boundary condition ) . in order to solve the problem , we deduce in this work a generalization of the crossover scattering framework , based on a diagrammatic method which was proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] , to study the crossover regime in the chaotic dirac billiard connected to a source and a drain of the conductance electrons . as a relevant application of our framework ,",
    "we study the chaotic graphene quantum dot ( chaotic dqd ) , obtaining general analytical expressions for the average of the conductance and for the correlation functions of conductance as a function of energy , magnetic flux , straining of the graphene monolayer@xcite and confinement by massive , armchair and zigzag edges @xcite . in particular , we show the full suppression of the weak localization term as a function of the straining , in full agreement with the experimental findings of ref .",
    "moreover , in the limit of high massive confinement , we recover the results obtained in ref . [ ] which uses semi - classical theory .",
    "however , we emphasize the generality of our rmt framework , which is applicable to all categories of chaotic dqd .    the work is divided as follows : in section i we give a brief account of the quantum chaotic scattering theory employed in the rmt treatment of chaotic dirac quantum dot ( cdqd ) . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the rmt crossover scattering framework to the chaotic dirac billiard . in section iii",
    ", we include a brief discussion about the effective graphene hamiltonian and apply the it to discuss the statistical properties of the cdqd .",
    "we perform calculations and obtain general analytical expressions for the average of conductance and its correlation functions and also analyze their relevant limits .",
    "the conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "in a general stadium which confines electrons one can describe the conductance and its universal fluctuations using known methods of resonant scattering . the electrons inside the stadium execute confining potential - affected motion governed by the schrdingier or the dirac equation .",
    "the electrons suffer multiple reflections from the boundaries and standing waves are generated , which represent the eigenstates of the system . taking into account the coupling of the interior of the stadium to the outside region results in transforming the standing waves into resonances with a width that measures the time it takes the electrons to be transmitted yo the outside and electric conductance ensues . a convenient way to formalize the above , is through feshbach s projection operator method , commonly used to treat the compound nucleus resonances in nuclear reactions @xcite . denoting the total wave function of the system by @xmath2 , one introduces the projector @xmath3 which projects out the closed channels , namely the states in the interior of the stadium .",
    "the states with electrons outside the stadium , namely the open channels are projected out by @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the wave equation of the whole many - electron system , can then be decomposed into two coupled equations , one for @xmath8 , and the other for @xmath9 .",
    "the exact , full hamiltonian of the system @xmath10 , is also decomposed into four operators , viz @xmath11 .",
    "after well known manipulations one is able to derive a general exact expression for the scattering matrix @xmath12 , that describes resonant scattering ,    @xmath13    writing @xmath14phq = -i\\pi qhp \\delta(e - php)phq + qhp pr[1/(e - php)]phq \\equiv -i\\gamma_{q}/2 + \\delta_{q}$ ] , where @xmath15 is the width operator of the resonances , and @xmath16 is the real energy shift operator which is usually added to @xmath17 to define the resonance hamiltonian .",

    "use a spectral decomposition of @xmath19 .",
    "this is accomplished in @xcite , and used extensively by @xcite .",
    "neglecting the energy shift operator , and using matrix notation , the @xmath12-matrix which constitutes the basic theoretical object in quantum chaotic scattering theory based on rmt is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a real non - random matrix that represents the coupling of the internal region with the open channels , and @xmath10 is taken as a random hamiltonian pertaining to one of the university classes of random matrices , the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) with tri , the gaussian unitary ensemble , with tri breaking , and the gaussian simplectic ensemble ( gse ) . when using one of these ensembles to calculate averages of @xmath22 or @xmath23 , the distribution @xmath24 is required .",
    "analytical evaluation of these averages is quite involved as they require the evaluation of complicated triple integrals .",
    "only in the case of gue was it possible to actually obtain closed form expressions @xcite .",
    "generally , researchers rely on numerical simulations using random matrix generator @xcite .",
    "application of this theory to to microwave resonator physics is an ongoing program @xcite .",
    "an alternative method which allows the obtention of analytical results for any of the ensembles is based on the distribution of the @xmath12-matrix itself , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the ensemble here is dyson s circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) .",
    "the stub model is based on this approach , see @xcite , and it amounts to attaching a stub ( fictitious ) to the quantum dot and use it as a scaffolding to build the s - matrix .",
    "the size of the stub is chosen so that the dwell time in it is much larger than the dwell time in the dot .",
    "further , the permanence time of the electrons inside the dot + stub system , @xmath26 , is much shorter than the escape time , @xmath27 to the leads and open channels .",
    "these conditions guarantee that all the variables in the system , the fermi energy @xmath28 , and the magnetic field , @xmath29 , are made to be explicitly present in the reflection matrix @xmath30 ( of dimension ( m - n ) ) of the stub , leaving the s - matrix of the dot ( without the stub ) , @xmath31 , of dimension @xmath32 , be a a product of @xmath33 spin matrix times a matrix at @xmath34 , @xmath35 and zero spin - orbit scattering rate .",
    "as such the dot @xmath12-matrix , @xmath31 can be chosen from dyson s circular orthogonal ensemble of random matrix theory .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the @xmath12-matrix of the system ( dot plus leads ) is @xmath36 where @xmath4 and @xmath3 are projection matrices of dimensions , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
