    "the grbs are to our best knowledge the most energetic phenomena in the universe .",
    "so far intense efforts have been made both on the observational and theoretical grounds toward understanding of their natures , but their origins still remains to be investigated .",
    "one of the most important finding recently is that grbs are involved with relativistic collimated flows . to account for the observations , an extremely high bulk lorentz factor , typically more than 100 ,",
    "is required @xcite .",
    "grbs are known to be composed of two classes : long - duration grbs ( with duration being longer than a few seconds ) and short - duration grbs ( with duration being less than a second ) .",
    "at least , some of the long - duration grbs are known to be associated with supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "good examples of grb - sn connection are grb980425/sn1998bw @xcite and grb030329/sn2003dh @xcite .",
    "these provide strong evidences that the central engines of ( at least part of ) the long - duration grbs are sne .",
    "such association was theoretically predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a signature of a supernova contribution is actually found in the afterglow spectra of these grbs .",
    "these supernovae are categorized in the type ic whose progenitor has lost its hydrogen and helium envelope when the core - collapse occurs .",
    "another possible grb associated with sn is grb021211 .",
    "a strong absorption feature is observed in the spectrum of the afterglow @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the absorption is due to caii which is synthesized by the associated supernova explosion .",
    "further , the discovery of the host galaxy of the long duration grbs being star forming galaxies @xcite also strengthens the idea of strong grb - sn connection .",
    "it has been suggested that even supernovae , in which no associated grb was found , might have a link with grb .",
    "for example , the peculiar sn2002ap recorded a high velocity component of @xmath12 and huge kinetic energy of the jet of @xmath13 ergs , at least .",
    "these values are similar to those of grbs , indicating a similar explosion mechanism of sn2002ap to that of grbs .",
    "@xcite concluded that sn2002ap is one example of the supernovae which failed to make a grb .",
    "recently , a number of x - ray - rich grbs ( xrrs ) and xrfs , very similar phenomena to grbs but with significantly lower peak energy , have been successively discovered thanks to the good performance of hete-2 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the event rates of xrrs and xrfs are similar to that of the long duration grbs @xcite",
    ". the origin of these events is poorly understood , but similar burst properties of grb , xrrs , and xrfs except for peak energy leads to an idea that they all might have the same origins but with different viewing angles ( nakamura 2000 ) or with variable opening angles ( lamb et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we elucidate the theory of xrfs , xrrs , and grbs in the context of the so - called collapsar model .",
    "the collapsar is a death of a massive star in the last stage of the stellar evolution .",
    "the collapsar model for grbs was proposed by woosley ( 1993 ; see also macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , for a central engine of grbs . in this model , strong outflows , or jets , emerge from deeply inside the collapsar and propagate into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , producing gamma - ray bursts .",
    "@xcite performed two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations based on this model .",
    "assuming annihilation of neutrino and anti - neutrino , they deposited thermal energy around the center of the core which had been collapsed and become a black hole . their initial mass density profile is very flattened due to rotation of the progenitor .",
    "the gas around the center , where the high thermal energy is deposited , expands and forms very collimated outflow ; i.e. , a `` jet '' .",
    "the outflow successfully became a bipolar outflow .",
    "unfortunately , however , their calculations were not relativistic one , so the relativistic effects which are important to understand grbs were not included .",
    "since the mass density of the progenitor is quite high , it is not a trivial issue whether or not the formed outflow can always keep collimated structure and break out from the progenitor surface as a jet .",
    "it has been pointed out through the agn jet simulations that the multi - dimensional effects are so important for the dynamics of the `` light jet '' into some dense gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . here",
    ", light jet stands for the jet , the mass density of which is smaller than that of the ambient gas .",
    "at least two dimensional hydrodynamic calculations are indispensable to investigate the outflow propagation and its dynamics inside and outside the progenitor .    multi - dimensional ,",
    "relativistic hydrodynamic simulations have been so far performed by several groups in the context of collapsar model @xcite .",
    "@xcite , for example , performed relativistic hydrodynamic simulations based on the model by @xcite .",
    "they have found that a bipolar flow is created and it breaks out from the progenitor .",
    "interestingly , the maximum lorentz factor of about 40 has been achieved , when the jet breaks out of the progenitor .",
    "another type of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the outflow have also been performed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they modeled a mainly very hot jet , i.e. an initially thermal energy dominated jet .",
    "injected jets from the computational boundary , which is assumed to be very close to the collapsed center of the progenitor , always successfully propagate in the progenitor keeping good collimation and break out the progenitor .",
    "it is still open question , however , whether a collimated outflow emerging from the center of the progenitor can always break out or not .",
    "although several provenance studies have demonstrated successful propagation throughout the progenitor and breakout of the input outflow , they might have assumed unrealistically large energy input in the initial condition .",
    "we should be aware that the formation mechanism of the outflow from the center of the collapsed progenitor has been poorly understood .",
    "in other words , we still do not know the physical conditions ( density , thermal energy , kinetic energy , magnetic energy , opening angle etc ) for generating outflows .",
    "further , it is not completely clear yet what discriminates between sne associated with grbs and those without grb association .",
    "the connection between xrfs and grbs is another important issue .",
    "a key factor may be attributed to the different dynamics of the outflow propagation .    motivated by these questions we perform series of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the outflow propagation in the progenitor and ism . in these simulations",
    ", we fix the total input energy power of @xmath14 but vary the bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath6 ) and the specific internal energy of the initial outflow ( @xmath9 which excludes the rest mass energy ) .",
    "we discuss what types of outflow can emerge from the central system for a wide range of parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we introduce our model and then explain the numerical methods and the initial background and outflow conditions .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] , where we will demonstrate the emergence of two distinct types of outflows : a collimated jet and an expanding outflow .",
    "we then discuss the dynamics and structure of the outflow , focusing on the distinctions between the two types of flows in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "our model is based on the collapsar model ( see , e.g. , woosley 1993 ) . according to this model",
    "the release of the gravitational energy is the main energy source of the energetic phenomena .",
    "this model explains the formation of an outflow as follows : when an iron core of the massive star collapses , a system consisting of a black hole or a proto - neutron star and an accretion disk is formed at the center of the progenitor .",
    "some fraction of the collapsing gas can produce an outflow , although the formation mechanism of this outflow is not fully understood yet , as in the case of agn jets .",
    "annihilation of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos emitted from the accretion disk or via mhd process is a possible scenario to generate such outflows .",
    "the progenitor is expected to spin rapidly .",
    "the gas along the rotational axis can freely fall into the center while the gas along the equatorial plane only gradually falls because of stronger centrifugal force . as a result ,",
    "a tenuous regions are created along the rotational axis .",
    "after the core collapse , the outer envelopes begin to fall freely .",
    "the free fall timescale of the envelopes is longer than the dynamical time scale for the jet to propagate within the progenitor and to hit its surface .",
    "after the formation of the outflow , it should propagate in the progenitor and break out the surface of the progenitor into ism .",
    "finally the outflow is observed as a grb and an afterglow .",
    "we adopt the radial mass profile from @xcite , assuming that the progenitor is spherically symmetric when the iron core was collapsed ( see however @xcite for recent calculations on the effects of the angular momentum and magnetic fields ) . at least near the core",
    ", the profile along the equatorial axis is very similar to that used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the progenitor had a mass of about 40 solar masses in the main sequence and has 16 solar masses in the pre - supernovae stage .",
    "the hydrogen envelope has already been lost by the stellar wind .",
    "although our progenitor includes helium envelope which would produce type ib sn , main properties of the outflow dynamics , such as , collimated jet or expanding outflow described below , strongly depend on the mass profile around the injection point , i.e. silicon , carbon , and oxygen envelopes .",
    "our main conclusion is not affected whether we adopt the progenitor which includes helium envelope or not .",
    "figure [ 1ddensity ] shows the radial mass density profile from the center to the surface of the progenitor .",
    "the mass density decreases from @xmath15 to @xmath16 from the center to the surface located at 3.7 @xmath17 cm from the center .",
    "the lower boundary of the computational domain ( @xmath18 ) is set to be @xmath19 cm from the center of the progenitor .",
    "the center of the progenitor is set to be @xmath20 ( see figure [ condition_fig ] for a schematic view of the progenitor and the location of the computational box ) . note that the total mass of the progenitor within this radius is about two solar masses ; that is , here we postulate the situation that material of about two solar masses collapses towards the center and forms the system of a proto - neutron star or black hole and a surrounding accretion disk .",
    "this distance between the center of the progenitor and the computational lower boundary is the same as that adopted by @xcite .",
    "we will also calculate an additional case study , in which the lower boundary is set to be at @xmath21 cm from the center , following @xcite , in which thermal energy is deposited as a driver of the outflow .",
    "since the pressure becomes very high due to the strong bow shock , the pressure of the progenitor can be negligible .",
    "the initial thermal energy in the progenitor is set to be very low .",
    "the formation mechanism of the outflows around the core is not fully understood yet .",
    "we assume injection of an initial outflow from the lower boundary and that the direction of the initial outflow is parallel to that of the cylindrical ( @xmath22 ) axis .",
    "this method is basically the same as that adopted by @xcite @xcite and @xcite , although the injected outflows calculated by @xcite and @xcite had a finite opening angles and were not initially parallel flow . in the present study the radius ( @xmath23 ) and power ( @xmath24 ) of the injected outflow",
    "is fixed to be @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in this paper",
    "the subscript 0 stands for the values of the injected outflow and @xmath24 does not include the rest mass energy .",
    "the energy flux ( @xmath27 ) does not depend on radius .",
    "the net injected energy during the first ten seconds amounts to @xmath28 ergs .",
    "this values is close to the explosive energy of sn1998bw and sn2003dh and is higher than the normal explosive energy of @xmath29 ergs @xcite .",
    "such energetic supernovae are sometimes categorized as hypernovae .",
    "two more parameters are necessary to specify the outflow condition .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath6 ) and specific internal energy ( @xmath9 ) are chosen in this paper .",
    "these parameters characterize the kinetic and thermal energy per particle in the injected outflow , respectively . as @xmath9 and/or @xmath6 increases ,",
    "so does the kinetic and/or thermal energy per particle .",
    "the rest mass density and pressure of the injected outflow can be derived from these two parameters , assuming an equation of state .",
    "the larger @xmath9 and/or @xmath6 is , the smaller becomes the rest mass density .",
    "for example , the rest mass density ( @xmath30 ) is given as @xmath31^{-1 }      [ \\pi r_{0}^2]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is adiabatic index .",
    "the ideal gas equation of state , @xmath33 , is employed , where @xmath34 is pressure , and the definition of specific enthalpy @xmath35 is used .",
    "the equation ( [ density_1 ] ) is derived from @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ epsilon_gamma ] shows rest mass density in the ( @xmath37 ) plane for fixed total energy , @xmath26 and the radius , @xmath25 , of the injected outflow .",
    "the symbols in the plane present the calculated models .",
    "assuming that all the initial total energy is efficiently converted to kinetic energy , we can estimate the maximum bulk lorentz factor from the energy conservation law , @xmath38 @xcite where @xmath39 is baryon mass of the outflow .",
    "approximately the total energy is the sum of the rest mass , kinetic , and thermal energy , @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "then the maximum lorentz factor of a fire - ball can be estimated as ( piran 1999 ) @xmath41 which means almost all thermal energy is converted to kinetic energy during expansion like sn explosion @xcite .",
    "we will systematically vary @xmath6 and @xmath9 to survey any possible physical situations , since we are unaware which is the case .",
    "the condition which determines these parameters should depend on the formation mechanism of the outflow from the center of the progenitor , i.e. , we should know in detail how the mass and the angular momentum are distributed in the progenitor , how a massive star collapses , how the neutrino transport occurs , and how the magnetic field grows and affects the dynamics .",
    "for example , a rapidly rotating massive star can form geometrically thick accretion disk around a new - born black hole or proto - neutron star after the core - collapse .",
    "the amount of the neutrino and anti - neutrino emission from such an accretion disk could be large .",
    "then the annihilation rate of neutrino and anti - neutrino will be large enough so that thermal dominated outflow may be generated .",
    "if the accretion disk is thin due to a lack of rapid rotation of the progenitor , conversely , the annihilation rate will be small , which may results in the formation of a baryon rich outflow .",
    "note , however , that these conclusions may not be firm , since we still do not know the formation mechanism of this outflow .",
    "magnetic fields could be a key here .",
    "since there is a possibility that a non - relativistic but collimated outflow is generated from the center of the progenitor , we explore both the relativistic and non - relativistic outflows .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath6 , is varied from the relativistic to the non - relativistic regimes , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( which correspond to @xmath44 0.98 , 0.97 , 0.94 , 0.87 , 0.7 , 0.6 , 0.5 , 0.4 , and 0.3 , respectively . ) .",
    "the specific internal energy , @xmath45 , is changed from 30 , 5 , 1.0 , and 0.5 . as a result ,",
    "the rest mass density of the outflow is in the range from @xmath46 [ the fastest and hottest outflow : @xmath47 to @xmath48 [ the slowest and coldest outflow : @xmath49 .",
    "the pressure of the outflow also changes .",
    "table [ conditions ] summarizes 25 calculated models .    to compare with @xcite we also list the ratio of the total energy to kinetic energy , @xmath50 , is presented in the table , where the rest mass energy is excluded from the total energy ; @xmath51 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "because the definition of @xmath50 in @xcite was changed to be the ratio of kinetic energy to total energy , we also show the inverse of @xmath50 in the table .",
    "our model a300 , ( @xmath52)=(5,30 ) is similar one studied by @xcite .",
    "the theoretically estimated lorentz factor @xmath53 from eq .",
    "( [ maxgam ] ) is also shown in table [ conditions ] .",
    "some cases , for example @xmath54 ) , produce subsonic flow and are , hence , difficult to calculate .",
    "we exclude such cases from table [ conditions ] to assure good numerical accuracy .",
    "since the mass density of the progenitor in the innermost region for the computation is about @xmath55 , all our models produce initially so - called light jet .",
    "if the flow can keep the collimated structure in the progenitor , such an outflow is expected to interact with the back flow @xcite and has complex internal structures in the jet . from eq .",
    "( [ maxgam ] ) we understand that the most predominant case for the grbs is the outflow with very high @xmath6 and high @xmath9 ; i.e. , model a300 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the second one is model a50 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we numerically solve two dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic equations , assuming the axisymmetric geometry .",
    "the basic equations are , @xmath58 @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the @xmath61-th velocity component .",
    "the equations are written in the unit that the speed of light is unity .",
    "the updated version of numerical hydrodynamic code used in @xcite is employed in this study .",
    "the code adopts godunov - type scheme which is advantageous for capturing strong shocks with a few grid points in good accuracy . in this version",
    "the physical values , such as , pressure , rest mass density and the space components of 4-velocity , are used for this interpolation using the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) which allows us to get third order accuracy in space .",
    "the version of third order accuracy in space is used .",
    "the results of 1d and 2d test calculations are presented in the appendix .    in this study",
    ", we calculate the propagation of the outflow crossing through the progenitor for 10 seconds after the outflow injection .",
    "since the outflow crossing timescale is shorter than the free - fall timescale , we neglect the gravitational field by the core .",
    "we also ignore self - gravity , for simplicity .",
    "when an outflow propagates from the inner boundary towards the surface of the progenitor , a strong bow shock appears and drives the progenitor gas to high pressure and temperature .",
    "nucleosynthesis could occur in the such a hot and high density medium .",
    "since produced entropy due to the nucleosynthesis is much smaller than that by the strong shock , we do not consider nucleosynthesis as an energy source in the energy equation ( eq . [ energy ] ) .",
    "we assume the ideal gas equation of state , that is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 ) is adiabatic index .",
    "we used non - uniform grid points .",
    "logarithmically uniform 500 grid points are spaced for @xmath64 .",
    "we also set uniform 120 zones for @xmath65 cm and logarithmically uniform 130 zones for @xmath66 cm .",
    "some of our results , especially those having slower injection velocity ( @xmath67 ) , exhibit spreading outflow , which has a large transverse component of the flow with respect to the direction of the injected flow .",
    "we find in the test calculations of 1d shock tube problem with relativistic transverse velocity ( see , [ shtranseverse ] ) that the limited resolution of our numerical codes produces some numerical errors ( numerical errors in both positional and absolute values of density , pressure , 3-velocity , up to several tens of percent ) .",
    "however , in some slower models , such as , models g01 , h01 , and i01 , the flow is close to non - relativistic flows and the errors caused by the relativistic transverse velocity are negligible . in some faster models , such as , models a300 , a50 , a10 , a05 , etc ,",
    "the relativistic flow in mainly appear in the collimated jet and propagates along the cylindrical axis . since the transverse velocity is not so large , the numerical errors caused by the transverse velocity are also negligible .",
    "we can thus conclude that the errors in mildly relativistic and spreading models may affect to the opening angle , but does not alter our main conclusion of a smooth transition from the collimated jet to the expanding outflow that is discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the achieved maximum lorentz factors in each simulations are not affected by this numerical error .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath68 cm is reflective except the inner 7 grid points which are used to inlet outflow .",
    "the reflective boundary condition is also employed at cylindrical axis .",
    "the outflow boundary condition is employed at @xmath69 cm and @xmath70 cm .",
    "we compellingly replace the numerical flux at the boundary using injection conditions , such as , @xmath30 , @xmath9 , and @xmath6 , to inlet the outflow .",
    "the numerical fluxes of the mass , momentum for @xmath22 direction , and energy at the injection points ( @xmath71 ) are given as @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "first , we show the results of the high lorentz - factor cases with @xmath75 ; i.e. , models a01 , a10 , a50 , and a300 .",
    "figure [ panels ] shows the contours of rest mass density ( upper ) and lorentz factor ( lower ) in each model at the time of breakout of the jet ; @xmath76 s ( a300 ) , @xmath76 s ( a50 ) , @xmath77 s ( a30 ) , and @xmath78 s ( a01 ) , respectively .",
    "note that the lower - left corner of each panel does not correspond to the center of the progenitor ( see again fig .",
    "[ condition_fig ] ) .",
    "the region with a large lorentz factor is localized and is found only along the cylindrical axis .",
    "this means that the outflow propagates throughout the progenitor , keeping a very collimated structure .",
    "thus we call this collimated outflow a jet . the half opening angle ( @xmath5 ) of the jet in each model",
    "is kept small ; it is only @xmath79 , when the breakout occurs ( see , table [ conditions ] ) .",
    "the collimated jet is surrounded by the shocked progenitor gas and back flow .",
    "the width of the jet is about @xmath80 cm when the jet breaks .",
    "lateral shocks are found at distances of about @xmath81 cm from the @xmath22-axis .",
    "since the mass density of the injected outflow is much smaller than that of progenitor near the center ( see the previous section ) , the velocity of the head of the jet is less than that of the jet ( @xmath82 ) , as was analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the jet takes about 3 sec to cross over the progenitor .",
    "the collimated jet eventually breaks out of the surface of the progenitor .",
    "we observed small differences in the crossing times of the jet within the progenitor among these models .",
    "the jet in model a01 passes through the progenitor in a shorter time than that in model a10 , and , the jet in model a10 passes in an even shorter time than that in model a50 and a300 .",
    "this can be understood , since a lighter jet , i.e. , lower density jet , feels larger resistance to proceed in the progenitor than a denser jet .",
    "the dynamics and morphology of the calculated jet , such as its collimated structure and the appearance of a back flow , are very similar to those shown by zhang et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the flow structure is also very similar to those simulated in the context of agn jet propagation , although most previous simulations have been done under the assumption of a constant ambient density .",
    "one of the most prominent features of the jets in high-@xmath6 models is the appearance of the back flow ( see fig .",
    "[ backflow]a ) . in this figure , only main flow , i.e. , a jet , and back flow from the head of the jet are shown .",
    "since the jet propagates in the progenitor whose gas density decreases outward , the hot spot does not clearly appear , to the contrary to the simulation of the jet propagation into a dense gas cloud with no density gradient . at the head of the jet",
    "three discontinuities exist : bow shock or forward shock ( fs ) which drives progenitor gas to a high pressure and high temperature state , contact discontinuity ( cd ) , and reverse shock ( rs ) or terminal mach shock .",
    "the kinetic energy of the outflow is converted to thermal energy thorough the reverse shock .",
    "the gas which passed this reverse shock forms a back flow in the anti - parallel direction to that of the jet .",
    "the path of the back flow is not straight but is meandering . the interaction between the main jet flow and the back flow enhances the oblique shocks in the jet flow . as a result , the profile of the physical quantities , such as density , pressure , and lorentz factor , is not monotonically decreasing nor increasing outward .",
    "figure [ 1dpressure ] shows one dimensional profile ( along the @xmath22 axis ) of the rest mass density and lorentz factor of models a300 , a50 , a10 , and a01 in the early phase of the simulation .",

    "[ 1dseries ] for a series of one dimensional profiles of the rest mass density and the lorentz factor along the cylindrical axis of model a300 ) .",
    "the high lorentz factor ( @xmath83 ) originates from the components which are injected in the later phase ( @xmath84 s ) , although the head of the outflow has already passed through the boundary ( @xmath70 cm ) .",
    "this late appearance of the high lorentz factor component is consistent with the results by @xcite .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor in each model is in good agreement with the ones predicted by eq .",

    "[ 1dseries ] .",
    "when an outflow is injected to the computational domain , the radius of the outflow increases via adiabatic expansion . at this time the thermal energy is converted to the kinetic one and thus the lorentz factor increases .",
    "this implies that the acceleration occurs due to the effective conversion of the thermal energy to kinetic energy during the propagation in the progenitor . as we show in fig.[1dpressure ] , the lorentz factor does not monotonically increase upward but decreases at the points where the density increases .",
    "these points correspond to the locations of oblique shocks . there",
    "exist not only oblique shocks but also rarefactions , in which the density decreases while the lorentz factor increases .",
    "the pressure inside of the bow shock is very smooth except at the places where discontinuities appear .",
    "these discontinuities follow each other , i.e. the separations between them do not grow with time ( see , fig [ foward_reverse ] which presents schematic figure of the positions of discontinuities ) .",
    "this feature is quite different from the shocks produced by a spherical explosion , such as supernova remnant , where the fs and rs separate with time .",
    "most of the kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy at the rs .",
    "the hot gas between the rs and cd is exhausted to lateral direction and finally generates a back flow .    even after the breakout of the outflow from the progenitor surface we continued to calculate the propagation of the jet up to the distance of @xmath87 cm .",

    "fig . [ eruption ] shows rest mass density ( upper ) and lorentz factor ( lower ) of model a50 at @xmath88 s , which illustrates how the jet breaks out and expands to the ism .",
    "although the shocked progenitor gas and the cocoon which comprises the back flow are confined within a narrow zone by a strong bow shock before the breakout , this is no longer the case after the breakout .",
    "in fact , all the progenitor gas , including the back flow and the cocoon , begin to expand and forms a global outflow towards the ism .",
    "note , however , that still the high velocity component survives along the @xmath22-axis . as a result ,",
    "high velocity component is surrounded by slow velocity and dense component .",
    "we will further follow jet propagation in near future .",
    "the outflows with smaller injection velocity behave very differently , compared with those with larger injection velocity presented above . in this section",

    "figure [ panels2 ] shows the contours of rest mass density and lorentz factor of these three models at @xmath91 ( g50 ) , @xmath92 ( g10 ) , and @xmath93 ( g01 ) , respectively .",
    "in contrast with the previous cases the outflow shows an expanding structure like a fan .",
    "let us remind that the injected outflow is initially parallel to the cylindrical axis .",
    "this expanding structure can be seen from the early phase of the evolution of the outflow .",
    "we also see that the rs separates from the fs with time in these cases .",
    "the high velocity region can be seen around the innermost region which ends at the reverse shock , forming a `` disk''-like region with a large cross section ( hereafter called as a disk ) , where the cross section stands for the area of the disk in the three dimensional space ( see figure [ backflow]b and [ foward_reverse ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the separation between the fs and rs increases with the time in the present cases , just as in supernovae remnant or pulsar wind , which makes a good contrast with the cases of the collimated jet . as the outflow expands with a large opening angle , the cross section of the cd increases .",
    "since the cross section is proportional to square of the radius of the outflow , the flow with a large opening angle needs so large dragging power to proceed .",
    "this suppresses the back flow formation at the head of the jet . as the cross section of the cd increases , the gas is gradually collected at the head of the flow because the fs sweeps up the progenitor gas",
    "this works to enhance the expansion of the outflow to the lateral direction , thus an opening angle being increased .",
    "the half opening angle @xmath5 of the outflow at the break is 22@xmath94 ( g01 ) , 30@xmath94 ( g10 ) , and 26@xmath94 ( g50 ) , respectively .",
    "the continuous transition from the collimated jet to the expanding outflow takes place , as the lorentz factor ( and thus velocity ) of the injected outflow decreases .",
    "this is nicely illustrated in figure [ panels3 ] , which shows the density and @xmath95 contours of models with a variety of @xmath6 values .",
    "the specific internal energy of the injected outflow is fixed to be @xmath96 . for models",
    "a01 , b01 , c01 , and d01 we find a collimated jet , the half opening angle of which is only a few degrees .",
    "the outflow starts to show an expanding tendency from model e01 @xmath97 , in which the half opening angle @xmath98 at the time when the outflow breaks out , and finally model i01 exhibits a typical expanding - fan structure with @xmath99 at @xmath100 s ( see table [ conditions ] ) .",
    "the radius of the outflow gradually increases as the velocity of injected outflow decreases .",
    "the sideway expansion of the bow shock becomes significant when @xmath101 is small , @xmath102 .",
    "the same transition also takes place in other series of models .",
    "we next fixed the internal energy to be @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the opening angle in each model varies from a few degrees ( model a10 , and a50 ) to more than @xmath105 degrees ( models g50 and h10 ) .",
    "the transition takes place in models d10 and d50 , in which the specific internal energy @xmath45 if fixed to 1.0 and 5.0 , respectively .",
    "we summarize these results in fig .",
    "[ epsilon_gamma ] , in which circles , squares , and triangles indicate the cases with a half opening angle of the outflow at the time of the breakout or at the time @xmath100 s being @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the rs separates from the cd and the fs in cases of the expanding outflow .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor @xmath85 achieved in the calculation in every model is presented in table [ conditions ] .",
    "those are good agreement with theoretical estimated @xmath53 .",
    "the numerical errors caused by the relativistic transverse velocity respect to the propagation direction described in the [ basiceq ] and [ shtubetrans ] are only appreciable in the intermediate cases between collimated jet to expanding outflow .",
    "we estimate that the numerical errors produce an uncertainly of 10 percent in the lorentz factor at which the transition happens .",
    "our main conclusion is not affected by the numerical errors of this sort , however , since the numerical errors are negligible in outflow which keeps quite good collimation , as well as in non - relativistic outflows .",
    "we do not know where and how the outflow forms and evolves in the progenitor at present . to see how sensitive the jet propagation properties are to the injection point",
    ", we also calculated model a50b , in which the lower boundary is set to be @xmath21 cm from the center ; that is , @xmath109 cm closer than in other cases ( @xmath19 cm ) .",
    "other model parameters are the same as those of model a50 . since the progenitor has a very large density gradient in the radial direction at small radii , it is not trivial weather the outflow can drill this `` wall '' in this case .",
    "note that @xcite also set the inner boundary at @xmath21 cm and deposited thermal energy around the boundary .",
    "[ inner ] shows the results of model a50b at the time @xmath110 s when the outflow breaks out . there is a difference in the early phase ( @xmath111 s ) of the dynamics compared with model a50 .",
    "the higher density of progenitor gas prevents the outflow from proceeding to the direction of @xmath22 axis .",
    "the outflow gradually drills the progenitor , and the bow shock spreads to lateral direction . except for these subtle differences ,",
    "the morphology and dynamics are very similar , once the outflow drills out the high density region .",
    "the outflow can keep the collimated structure during the propagation in the progenitor .",
    "a back flow appears in both cases .",
    "the outflow can finally break out the progenitor as shown in case a50 .",
    "we observe a dramatic but smooth transition from collimated structure to expanding one in the outflow propagation by changing the lorentz factor and specific internal energy of the injected outflow .",
    "what is the key physics which is responsible for the transition ?",
    "one of them is the pressure of the injected outflow . the pressure of the injected outflow in the models of the collimated jet is lower than that of expanding outflow .",
    "additionally , we , here , point out that the appearance of the ( internal ) reconfinement shock could be a key , since the lateral expansion is suppressed by the presence of the reconfinement shock @xcite , thus leading to a formation of the collimated jet structure . in fact , high - pressure regions driven by a bow shock can keep the collimated structure .",
    "models which have expanding structure have no or less internal structure in the reverse and side shocks .",
    "then the injected flow is bi - forked . on the contrary ,",
    "models which keep the collimated structure have a number of internal oblique shocks within the jet .",
    "the existence of a back flow also enhances the appearance of such shocks .",
    "such shocks may allow the magnetic field generation in the jet ( discussed later ) .",
    "the internal shock model was introduced by rees & meszaros ( 1994 ; see also kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 , and spada et al .",
    "2001 ) to explain very short time variation of grbs .",
    "it is predicted that the outflow has up to a few hundred internal structures or `` shells '' and multiple two shell collisions occur at the distance of @xmath112 cm from the fire ball which emits gamma - rays .",
    "a simple linear analysis by @xcite and @xcite concludes that the timescale for a jet to propagate to the progenitor surface is long enough for perturbations to grow to form internal shocks and variability in grbs .",
    "the instability is caused by the shear flow or perturbation in pressure , density , and/or velocity in lateral direction in the jet .",
    "the derived growth rate of the shear instability monotonically increases with the decrease of the wavelengths @xcite .",
    "although with our current resolution it is impossible to resolve such fine structure , we can estimate the timescale of the instability , assuming the specific internal structure , say , that seen in fig [ 1dpressure ] . taking the wavelength to be a typical interval of the oblique shocks , @xmath113 cm , and bulk lorentz factor to be @xmath114 , we find that the timescale of the shortest mode in model a50 is on the order of @xmath115 s. this growing timescale is sufficiently shorter than the dynamical one ; that is , there is ample time for perturbations to grow to shocks , as was claimed by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the shear instability scenario , there exists another possible cause of the internal oblique shocks ; that is the interaction between the jet and the back flow .",
    "as the path of the back flow is not straight , the boundary between main jet and the back flow is not smooth but dynamically perturbed .",
    "since the dynamics is so complicated and is non - linear , it is hard to specify which mechanism , either the growth of the instability in the jet or the interaction between the jet and the back flow , is dominant for the appearance of the internal shocks .",
    "the detailed structure should depend on the resolution of the calculation .",
    "for this reason , we have calculated the same model as model a50 but with twice higher resolutions than that of model a50 ; that is model a50c . fig .",
    "[ panels4]a shows the results of model a50c ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ 1dpressure ] for comparison ) .",
    "the discontinuities still clearly appear in a50c , as well , but the number of discontinuity has increased than that of model a50 .",
    "the cocoon has fine structures and vortices .",
    "the emergence of vortices enhances the mixing of the back flow and shocked progenitor gas .",
    "the appearance of the oblique shocks in the jet could be a key to the collimation . whether such internal shocks appear or not strongly depends on how high pressure can be achieved by the presence of the bow shock .",
    "but it is difficult to predict whether the outflow expands or keeps collimated structure by a simple formula .",
    "what is clearly demonstrated through our simulations is that the large lorentz factor and/or internal energy of the outflow can make a strong bow shock ahead of the outflow , leading to a good confinement of an exploding hot outflow .    before closing this section",
    ", we wish to remark on the role of magnetic fields .",
    "the grbs quite generally exhibit power - law and non - thermal spectra produced by synchrotron emission .",
    "then , we need moderately strong magnetic fields within the jet , but it is not well understood how the magnetic field can be generated and grows in grbs . a plausible mechanisms for creating magnetic fields is the weibel instability which sets out when the velocity field is not isotropic and which can amplify magnetic fields quickly .",
    "further , the particle acceleration to highly relativistic regime can take place in the shocks .",
    "@xcite showed relativistic electrodynamics particle simulations of launching jet into the ambient medium .",
    "they observed the amplification of non - uniform and small - scale magnetic fields by the weibel instability .",
    "although they studied the shock at the head of the jet , magnetic fields can also be amplified in internal shocks within the jet .",
    "if the magnetic field grows up , it will inevitably affect the emissivity of pre - cursors and emissivity of gamma - rays of grbs after breakout from the progenitor .",
    "if large - scale magnetic fields can be created , they should affect the dynamics of the outflow .",
    "we need further studies in this field .",
    "finally we discuss the astrophysical implications of our results .",
    "we have shown different types of outflow dynamics which can arise even by the input of the same total energy power through the initial outflow .",
    "the input outflows may propagate , keeping a collimated structure in the progenitor , or showing an expanding structure .",
    "the change of the outflow shape with changes in @xmath9 and @xmath6 is gradual ( see fig .",
    "[ epsilon_gamma ] ) .",
    "although we can not directly observe the propagation of the outflow within the progenitor due to a large optical depth , different dynamics will produce observable effects after the outbreak of the outflow .",
    "different outflow dynamics may account for a variety of phenomena .",
    "the outflow with significant collimation and high lorentz factor ( @xmath116 ) will produce grbs .",
    "when the lorentz factor in the collimated jet is a bit smaller , so is the peak energy of the emission .",
    "such an outflow could be observed as xrfs .",
    "some of our simulations show an expanding outflow even when @xmath6 and/or @xmath9 are relatively small .",
    "such outflows may be observed as less energetic explosions as xrfs , even if the viewing angle is relatively small .",
    "these cases may correspond to the high velocity but non - relativistic flow , such as sn2002ap , since the flow still has a directivity .",
    "there is another factor for explaining the differences between grbs and xrfs ; that is the viewing angle to the jet .",
    "recently the unified model has been proposed by @xcite and by @xcite who claim that the different phenomena are attributed to different viewing angles , although the bursts themselves are identical . if the viewing angle is less or near the jet opening angle , the object will be observed as a grb . if not , it will be identified as an xrf .",
    "@xcite derived the observational energy as a function of the viewing angle based on their simulations .",
    "the third but less unlikely possibility has been pointed out through the discovery of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) 1806 - 20 . because of its proximity",
    "its spectral and light variations have been recorded in unprecedent details @xcite .",
    "such an event may be observed as a short gamma - ray bursts , if it explodes in nearby galaxies , although its spectrum is basically blackbody and does not agree with those of grbs .",
    "finally , we comment on the synthesis of heavy elements .",
    "the large cross section of the forward bow shock is advantageous for the synthesis of heavy elements , since then wider regions are available for the nucleosynthesis ( macfadyen and woosley 1999 ; nagataki et al .",
    "we find that the outflows have an expanding structure in some cases .",
    "this expansion is reminiscent of the cases of aspherical explosions of supernova or hypernova as was shown in nagataki et al .",
    "2003 ( 1998 , see also nagataki 2000 , maeda & nomoto 2003 , nagataki et al .",
    "2006 ) . a large amount of heavy elements is expected to be synthesized by such an aspherical expansion , since the effective cross section of the bow shock is very large .",
    "the difference of the expansion should affect the amount of the synthesized elements .",
    "the viewing angle is also an important parameter for this type of outflow and is expected to explain the observed features of sne @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated explosive nucleosynthesis by hydrodynamic calculations along the line of the collapsar model .",
    "it is also possible that the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements can occur in the accretion disk surrounding the black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath117ni is synthesized in the jet like outflow and concluded that the amount of @xmath117ni becomes larger when the energy deposition occurs in a short time , since then the deposited energy is effectively converted to thermal energy by the strong shock .",
    "such calculations can be a good diagnostic tool to compare with the observations , since the amount of synthesized elements can be estimated .",
    "we investigate the propagation and dynamics of the outflows in the progenitor in the context of collapsar model for a central engine of grbs by means of hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we assume a fixed power input of the initial outflow of @xmath26 and the radius of the injected outflow @xmath118 cm , and follow the propagation of hot outflow for different values of @xmath9 and @xmath6 over the ranges of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the net energy for 10-second injection satisfies the explosive energy of so - called hypernovae @xmath121 ergs .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the propagation dynamics of the outflow dramatically changes from the collimated structure to the expanding one as @xmath6 decreases .",
    "if the lorentz factor is high enough , say @xmath122 , the outflow can propagate throughout the progenitor , keeping a very collimated structure .",
    "the half opening angle is @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "but the opening angle has weak dependence on @xmath9 , as well ; we get @xmath123 even for smaller @xmath6 but with small @xmath124 .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor is , on the other hand , sensitive to both of @xmath6 and @xmath9 ; roughly @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   in the relativistic , collimated flow ,",
    "a back flow , which is anti - parallel to the main jet , appears . during the propagation in the progenitor",
    ", we can see some internal structures caused by the instability grown by the shear flow in the jet or by the interaction between the jet and back flow in the collimated jets .",
    "such oblique shocks can help the reconfinement of the jet .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor of the jet follows a simple formula derived from energy conservation relation .",
    "after the breakout the outflow expands into the interstellar space , although there still remains a high velocity component along the @xmath22-axis .",
    "its half opening angle if a few degrees .",
    "this could be observed as grbs .",
    "another flow component which surrounds the central high velocity component can also be seen .",
    "it originates from the back flow during the propagation in the progenitor and shocked progenitor gas .",
    "3 .   when the lorentz factor ( or the initial velocity ) of the outflow is not large , say",
    ", @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) , the outflow no longer keeps the collimation and thus expands to the forward and lateral directions .",
    "eventually the outflow breaks out like an aspherical supernova explosion .",
    "this is because with the small outflow velocity the bow shock is weak and can not drive the progenitor gas to high enough pressure . as a result , the reconfinement shocks , which are necessary for the collimation , does not appear .",
    "thus , the structure is relatively featureless in the outflow . as the cross section of the reverse shock increases with time ,",
    "the mass is collected at the head of the outflow .",
    "this enhances lateral expansion .",
    "high lorentz factor ( @xmath127)is needed to explain energetic phenomena , such as grbs and xrfs , but the different initial internal energy affects the opening angle of the outflow for injected outflows of smaller lorentz factor , i.e. slower velocity , thereby producing a marked difference in its observable .",
    "rather low internal energy , @xmath124 , and relatively small lorentz factor ( @xmath128 5 ) leads to collimated non - relativistic jets , which will be observed as a failed grb .",
    "high internal energy , @xmath129 , leads to un - collimated relativistic jets , which could be observed as xrfs .",
    "we can thus phenomenologically explain different types of explosions , grbs xrfs , and failed grb along the same line but with different values of @xmath9 for slower injected velocity .",
    "however , a cause of producing a variety of @xmath9 and @xmath6 is still unknown . it should be investigated in future work .",
