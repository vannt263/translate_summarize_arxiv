    "the hydrogen molecule ( ) plays a central role in a variety of processes that significantly influence the chemical and physical state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . from observations by  and other spacecraft - borne observatories",
    ", a picture has emerged in which the bulk of interstellar  lies in clouds with densities between @xmath1 10 and a few 1000 @xmath2 , diameters less than a few tens of parsecs , and column densities @xmath3 @xmath4 , which allow the rapid formation of  on dust grains and provide self - shielding against dissociating photons @xcite . in order to determine whether this model , developed from observations of relatively nearby stars ( @xmath5 kpc ) , holds at larger distances , we observed seven stars in the galactic disk ( @xmath6 pc ) at distances out to 3.9 kpc using the berkeley spectrometer on the  telescope .",
    "the berkeley euv / fuv spectrometer , located at the prime focus of the 1-m  telescope , flew aboard the space platform _",

    "discovery_. the  project and the _ astro - spas _ platform are described in , while the design and performance of the berkeley spectrometer are discussed in @xcite and .    with an effective area of about 4 @xmath7 and a resolution @xmath8 over the wavelength range 3901170  , the berkeley spectrometer is ideally suited for absorption - line studies of bright , far - uv sources .",
    "some two dozen early - type stars were observed on the -i mission ; in this paper , we discuss the seven with @xmath6 pc .",
    "table [ targets ] lists the stars and their observational parameters .",
    "also given are the total  integration time and the statistical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in a 0.2   bin averaged over the 10451060   band in the resulting spectrum .",
    "the procedures for data extraction , background subtraction , and wavelength and flux calibration are described in .",
    "the flux calibration is based on in - flight observations of the hot white dwarf g191-b2b and is thought to be uncertain to less than 10% @xcite .",
    "a segment of the  spectrum of hd 99890 is presented in fig .",

    "we model the interstellar absorption features using an ism line - fitting package written by m. hurwitz and v. saba . given the column density , doppler broadening parameter , and relative velocity of a given species , the program computes a voigt profile for each line , convolves the lines with a gaussian to the instrument resolution , and uses the result as a transmission function by which to scale the model continuum . given these assumptions , the only free parameters in the fit are the continuum placement and the total column density of each absorbing species .    in principle , it is possible to derive the effective doppler parameter directly from the orfeus data by measuring the equivalent widths of many absorption features from a given @xmath9 level , sampling a range of oscillator strengths . in practice , line blending , continuum placement uncertainties , and the limited dynamic range of",
    "the accessible oscillator strengths make such analyses difficult .",
    "the resulting constraints on the effective doppler parameters ( typically 58 ) almost certainly reflect velocity - component structure rather than line broadening in a single cloud . instead , for the four lines of sight listed in table [ sembach ] , we take the doppler parameters , relative velocities , and relative column densities of the principal absorption components from the literature . for the remaining lines of sight , we assume a single absorption component with a doppler parameter @xmath10 km s@xmath11 , consistent with the @xmath12 values of 35  inferred for the @xmath13 2 to 4 lines of  from  observations ( and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath14 and 1 lines lie on the square - root part of the curve of growth and are thus insensitive to small uncertainties in @xmath12 @xcite .    to provide an estimate of the stellar continuum , we make use of reference spectra selected from the 0.2   spectral atlas @xcite",
    ". atlas counterparts , listed in table [ atlas ] , are selected for their similarity to the observed stars in mk classification and , where possible , in @xmath15 .",
    "the atlas spectra are smoothed to the resolution of the  data , re - sampled at the  pixel size , and scaled by a linear function to reproduce the observed stellar continuum . because the total  column density  in each reference spectrum is less than the uncertainty in either the @xmath14 or @xmath16 column of the corresponding program star , we do not attempt to correct for  absorption in the reference spectrum . for hd 93129a , an o3",
    "if * star , we expect the photospheric lines to be quite weak @xcite and therefore assume a linear continuum in modeling the interstellar absorption in its spectrum .",
    "following , we adopt 0.31   as the fwhm of the instrument point - spread function . in the course of this work",
    ", we have discovered small nonlinearities in the  wavelength calibration that will have to be quantified before the velocities of the absorbing clouds can be constrained . for this analysis",
    ", we assume that the clouds have zero radial velocity and adapt the wavelength scale accordingly .    to perform the model fit",
    ", we concentrate on the region between 1045 and 1060  , which contains most of the @xmath17 vibrational band in the lyman series , as this region seems least complicated by stellar photospheric absorption or overlapping werner bands of interstellar .",
    "the process is iterative : we begin by fitting the @xmath14 and @xmath16 lines , move on to the higher-@xmath9 lines , then repeat the process , as the higher-@xmath9 lines often lie on the wings of lower-@xmath9 features .",
    "isolated features elsewhere in the spectrum provide a double - check on our results .",
    "the large number of free parameters and the computationally - intensive nature of our fitting routine make an automated @xmath18-reduction algorithm impractical .",
    "instead , we vary the model column density about the best - fit value until the model line profile departs significantly from the data and use this as an estimate of the uncertainty in the fit . column densities derived in this way for the @xmath14 to 5 rotational levels of",
    "are presented in table [ results ] .",

    "[ model ] presents the spectrum of hd 99890 between 1045 and 1060   together with our best - fitting model .    to investigate the uncertainty introduced by assuming a single absorption component in the spectra of stars lacking published absorption - line parameters , we generate a series of synthetic spectra ( with s / n @xmath1 35 ) , each with two absorption components of equal column density separated by 5 , 15 , 25 , 35 , and 45 , respectively .",
    "to each synthetic spectrum , we fit a model assuming a single velocity component . for the @xmath14 and @xmath16 states ,",
    "the derived column densities differ by less than our quoted uncertainty over the entire 545  range . for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states",
    ", however , the difference can be significant : as great as 1.5 dex for the @xmath22 state in the 25 and 35  models , in the sense that a single - cloud model over - estimates the total column density in the @xmath22 state .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states vary , but not by more than our estimated uncertainties ( 0.5 dex ) .",
    "fortunately , the total column  is dominated by the @xmath14 and @xmath16 states @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 derived in ",
    "[ params ] are thus insensitive to uncertainties in the velocity structure of the absorbing medium .",
    "the strongest uv lines arise from the @xmath14 and @xmath16 levels , whose relative populations are established by thermal proton collisions , since the molecules are protected from photo - excitation by self - shielding in the lines .",
    "the mean excitation temperature of the clouds along each line of sight can thus be derived from the column densities @xmath27 and @xmath28 using the relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the statistical weights of @xmath14 and @xmath16 , respectively @xcite .",
    "cloud temperatures for the  lines of sight are presented in table [ results ] .",
    "our results are consistent with those obtained with  by , who derive values of @xmath26 ranging from 45 to 128 k , with an average of @xmath32 ( rms ) k , for 61 stars with  @xmath33 @xmath4 .",

    "the density limits derived via equation ( 2 ) are consistent with the values between 15 and 900 @xmath2 found by for interstellar clouds containing optically thick .",
    "while detailed modeling of the relative @xmath9 column densities is beyond the scope of this paper , we can investigate the radiation environments of the  clouds by comparing our observations with the predictions of previously - published models .",

    "he finds that the ratios @xmath35(4)/@xmath35(0 ) and @xmath35(5)/@xmath35(1 ) are controlled by the optical pumping rate , rather than by the electron temperature of the cloud , and concludes that clouds along four lines of sight are illuminated by an ultraviolet field several times that in the solar neighborhood .",
    "all four of these sight lines show values of @xmath38 > -4.8 $ ] .",
    "( a fifth sight line also showing a high value of @xmath35(4)/@xmath35(0 ) can be fit without recourse to an elevated radiation field . ) in table [ results ] , we see that five of our seven stars have @xmath38 > -4.8 $ ] .",
    "given that the uncertainty in this ratio is @xmath10.5 dex , we consider only the three stars with the highest values of @xmath39 , hd  93129a , hd  99857 , and hd  99890 . while his models assume a single absorbing cloud , points out that , if there are several clouds along the line of sight , the ultraviolet opacity within each cloud is lower than if only one cloud is present , and the observations can often be fit with several clouds at normal uv levels , rather than a single cloud with elevated illumination .",
    "multiple - cloud models may be able to reproduce the high @xmath39 ratios that we observe .",
    "on the other hand , the absorbing clouds may simply lie near the hot background stars . for hd  93129a in the carina nebula ,",
    "this is certainly the case ( cf .",

    "the change from small to large @xmath0 at  @xmath50 and @xmath44@xmath51@xmath52 @xmath4 is thought to reflect the column density at which the diffuse -bearing clouds provide self - shielding against radiative dissociation .",
    "the seven  disk stars fall squarely in the `` large  @xmath0 '' region of all three figures , indicating a common mechanism for  production .",

    "the five stars in our sample with @xmath55 kpc all lie at galactic longitudes between 287  and 298 , providing lines of sight directly through the sagittarius spiral arm .",
    "( the distances , taken from the literature , were originally derived from stellar spectral types and can be assumed accurate to about 25% ; , . ) unless the sagittarius arm is devoid of molecular gas , our results suggest that its clouds do not differ significantly in their gross properties from those near the sun .",

    "while the mean reddening @xmath58 $ ] in the galactic plane within 1 kpc of the sun is 0.61 mag kpc@xmath11 @xcite , the mean reddening to the  stars is 0.22 mag kpc@xmath11 .",

    ", we do not expect @xmath0 to approach unity at large distances , as it does toward the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that the molecular fraction of hydrogen should vary so little over the wide range of distances and mean densities sampled by  and .",
    "if the neutral and molecular hydrogen were not coupled , one might expect significant variations in the molecular fraction of hydrogen . on the other hand ,",
