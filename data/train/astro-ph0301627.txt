    "most grb jet models consider a uniform ( or ` top hat ' ) jet , where the lorentz factor , @xmath1 , and the energy per unit solid angle , @xmath2 , do not depend on the angle @xmath3 from the jet axis , within some finite well defined opening angle , @xmath8 , and drop sharply outside of @xmath8 .",
    "the possibility that grb jets can display an angular structure , where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are power laws in @xmath3 , was proposed by mszros , rees & wijers ( 1998 ) . recently , several different groups have analyzed afterglow observations within the frame work of the ` top hat ' jet model , and have inferred a relatively narrow distribution both for the total energy output in gamma - rays ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) and in the initial kinetic energy of the relativistic outflow ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ; piran et al .",
    "these results may alternatively be interpreted as grb jets having a universal structure , which is intrinsically the same for all grbs , and the observed differences between different grbs are a result of different viewing angles , @xmath9 , w.r.t the jet symmetry axis ( lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 2001 ; rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2002 ) .",
    "whereas in the ` top hat ' jet interpretation , the jet break time , @xmath10 , depends mainly on the initial opening angle of the jet , @xmath8 , in the universal ` structured ' jet interpretation , @xmath10 depends mainly on the viewing angle , @xmath0 , and the light curve is roughly similar to that for a ` top hat ' jet with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "while the evolution of ` top hat ' jets and their light curves has been widely investigated , much less work has been done on ` structured ' jets . here",
    "we describe the main results of kumar & granot ( 2003 , kg hereafter ) and granot & kumar ( 2003 , gk hereafter ) , and refer the reader to these works for more details .",
    "we begin with a numerical hydrodynamic calculation of the evolution of a relativistic jet ( kg ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are reduced to 1-d by assuming axial symmetry and integrating over the radial profile of the flow , thus considerably reducing the computation time .",
    "we examined initial conditions where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are power laws in @xmath3 , outside of a core angle , @xmath13 : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16^{1/2}$ ] , as well as a gaussian profile : @xmath17/(\\gamma_0 - 1)=\\epsilon(\\theta , t_0)/\\epsilon_0 = \\exp(-\\theta^2/2\\theta_c^2)$ ] . for simplicity , we show results only for a uniform ambient medium . the hydrodynamic evolution is shown in fig .",
    "1 . for power law jet profiles",
    "the lateral energy transfer is small , and as long as @xmath18a few , @xmath19 . for the gaussian profile , which is the steepest , a shock forms in the lateral direction , but",
    "most of the energy still remains at @xmath20 .",
    "the lateral velocity in the comoving frame is found to be @xmath21 for @xmath6 ( in kg we show analytically that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angle on which @xmath1 or @xmath2 change significantly ) .",
    "now we examine two simple models , where either : ( 1 ) @xmath24 , or ( 2 ) @xmath2 is averaged over the region to which a sound wave can propagate ( this simulates the maximal lateral energy transfer that is consistent with causality ) .",
    "we assume initial power law profiles , as described above , and calculate the afterglow light curves for observers at different viewing angles , @xmath9 , assuming synchrotron emission ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . for @xmath25",
    "the light curve initially rises [ before the deceleration time @xmath26 , and there is no jet break , which is quite different from observations for most afterglows . for @xmath27",
    "we find a jet break at @xmath10 when @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath29 the value , @xmath30 , of the temporal decay slope @xmath31 at @xmath32 , increases with @xmath9 , while @xmath33 decreases with @xmath9 .",
    "this effect is more prominent in model 1 , and appears to a lesser extent in model 2 , but is prominent in the light curves from the numerical calculation of the jet dynamics ( kg ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath34 should increase with @xmath10 , which is not supported by observations . for @xmath35",
    ", there is a flattening of the light curve just before the jet break , for @xmath36 .",
    "again , this effect is larger in model 1 , compared to model 2 .",
    "the light curves for the simulated jet dynamics ( kg ) show a reasonably sharp jet break at @xmath37 and flattening of the light curve just before the jet break becomes strong at @xmath38 .",
    "this leaves a factor of @xmath39 in @xmath40 for which there is a sharp jet break not preceded by a flattening , as is typically observed in afterglow light curves .",
    "since a larger range of @xmath9 ( @xmath41 for ` top hat ' jets ) is inferred ( @xmath42 ) , this poses a problem for a universal jet structure .",
    "we have described a numerical scheme for calculating the dynamics of structured relativistic jets . the lateral velocity in the local frame is found to be smaller than the sound speed , except for very sharp jet angular profiles .",
    "this causes the energy per unit solid angle , @xmath2 , to remain close to its initial value in the first few days , suggesting that a simple model ( model 1 ) where @xmath2 is constant in time , and each segment of the jet evolves as if it were part of a spherical flow , provides a good approximation for the jet dynamics and light curves for @xmath43a few days .    a universal jet profile , where all grb jets are intrinsically identical , and only our viewing angle changes between different grbs , has difficulty explaining all the afterglow light curves observed to date .",
    "this was demonstrated for @xmath44 , which is needed to reproduce the recent results of a roughly constant energy in grb jets .",
    "furthermore , we find that the jet break for structured jets in an external density @xmath45 are much smoother compared to a uniform density , in agreement with the result of kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) for a ` top hat ' jet . finally , the light curves for a gaussian initial jet profile are found to be similar to those for a ` top hat ' jet , and ( for @xmath46 ) produce sharp jet breaks , that are compatible with afterglow observations .",
