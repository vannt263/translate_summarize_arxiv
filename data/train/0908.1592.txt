    "when a disordered assembly of particles with short - range steric interactions becomes dense enough that the particles begin to overlap , a transition occurs from an unjammed state where the system easily flows or acts like a liquid to a jammed state where the system resists shear and shows a solid - like response .",
    "liu and nagel proposed a general phase diagram for disordered particle assemblies where a transition into a jammed state occurs as a function of several different variables including increasing density , decreasing external forcing , or decreasing temperature @xcite . at ` point j ' on this phase diagram",
    ", jamming occurs for increasing density at zero stress and zero temperature @xcite .",
    "there is growing evidence that point j has the properties of a critical point with diverging length scales on both sides of the jamming transition @xcite .",
    "point j has been well studied in the particular system of two - dimensional , finite range repulsive frictionless bidisperse disks with a radii ratio of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the bidispersity is necessary to prevent the system from crystallizing .",
    "simulations show that the jamming density @xmath9 , and experimental realizations of this system also give a similar jamming density @xcite .",
    "one aspect of jamming that has been less well studied is the dynamical response as point j is approached .",
    "if point j is a critical point , it could have strong effects on the dynamical response of the system to global or local forcing and may give rise to intermittent or avalanche behavior . in the numerical work of drocco _",
    "@xcite , the velocity fluctuations of a single probe particle driven with constant force showed signs of increasing intermittency and avalanche characteristics as @xmath1 approached @xmath2 .",
    "more recent experimental work in which a single probe particle was driven at constant force through a granular packing also indicates that the velocity fluctuations become increasingly intermittent as @xmath7 is approached @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that proximity to point j will strongly affect the dynamics and may result in the appearance of critical properties .",
    "the velocity and force characteristics of a locally driven particle have already been used as a probe of the yielding and dynamical properties of a two - dimensional disordered colloid system , where a finite threshold force must be applied before the particle can be set in motion @xcite .",
    "experiments and simulations of three - dimensional disordered colloidal systems have shown that a threshold force for motion appears when the density is high enough for a glass transition to occur @xcite , while for jamming in two dimensions a finite threshold force is also expected to appear above the jamming transition .",
    "drag effects in granular systems have been studied by moving a large obstacle through the granular media @xcite .",
    "geng and behringer analyzed the fluctuations of a probe particle held fixed in a two - dimensional system while the remaining grains were driven past @xcite , and found that the force fluctuations have intermittent characteristics and are exponentially distributed .    in this work",
    "we examine the velocity fluctuations of a probe disk driven with constant force through a two - dimensional bidisperse system of disks as the density of the system passes through point j. as @xmath7 is approached from below , the velocity fluctuations show increasingly intermittent properties characterized by large bursts of motion .",
    "the average probe particle velocity initially decreases linearly with increasing @xmath1 ; however , within a few percent of the jamming density , the average velocity falls to zero in a nonlinear manner .",
    "the velocity fluctuations are exponentially distributed when @xmath1 is within several percent of the jamming density , while within one percent of @xmath7 the velocity fluctuations have a non - exponential distribution which can be fit with a power law .",

    "the local rearrangements of disks near the probe particle increase in spatial extent as the jamming transition is approached from below .    for @xmath12 ,",
    "the probe particle is always able to move through the sample for arbitrarily small driving forces .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath5 , there is a finite threshold force @xmath13 required to move the probe particle . above the threshold force , progress of the probe particle is made possible by yielding of the surrounding particles that occurs via local plastic rearrangements of the disks near the moving probe particle .",
    "the appearance of a finite driving threshold in the jammed phase is similar to recent numerical studies of dense colloidal systems where a threshold force appeared in sufficiently dense samples @xcite .",
    "we find that the threshold force increases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the velocity fluctuations at drives just above the yielding transition @xmath13 have a nonexponential distribution , while at higher drives the velocity fluctuations become exponentially distributed .",

    "the initial disk packing is obtained by placing the disks in non - overlapping locations and then shrinking all disks , adding a few additional disks , and reexpanding all disks while thermally agitating the disks .",

    "after the disk configuration is generated , we select a single disk and drive it with a constant force @xmath23 .",
    "the motion of an individual disk @xmath24 at position @xmath25 is governed by the following overdamped equation : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the heaviside step function , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are either @xmath32 or @xmath33 depending on the type of each disk .",
