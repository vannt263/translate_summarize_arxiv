    "in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics using the hilbert framework , a quantum system is represented by a complex hilbert space @xmath1 , in which a state of the system is represented by a non - zero vector @xmath2 or , more generally , by its span @xmath3 , as a vector represents a state up to phase factor .    in particular ,",
    "let us focus on some elements of the formulation of quantum mechanics using the hilbert space framework :    1 .   a quantum system @xmath4 is represented by a complex hilbert space @xmath5 ; 2 .",
    "a state of @xmath4 is represented by a unitary vector @xmath2 of @xmath5 or , more generally , by a vector ray , i.e. a one - dimensional subspace of @xmath5 , corresponding to the span @xmath3 of @xmath2 ; 3 .",
    "information about the state of @xmath4 is obtained through a processus called _ measurement _ which , in terms of hilbert spaces , is represented by a hermitian operator @xmath6 on @xmath5 , and which is postulated to work the following way : if , immediately before a measurement @xmath6 is applied , the state of a quantum system is @xmath2 and if @xmath7 is an eigenvalue of @xmath6 and @xmath8 denotes the orthogonal projection on the eigenspace of @xmath6 associated to @xmath7 , then outcome @xmath7 will , according to the born rule , occur with probability  : @xmath9 in that case , right after the measurement occured , the state of the system will be @xmath10 ( up to a normalization factor , which we do not take into account , since we consider that quantum states are actually represented by vector rays and not by vectors themselves ) .    while probabilities play a central role in quantum mechanics",
    ", we will try to avoid them as much as possible in our discussion and , to that respect , we shall retain only one aspect of their meaning : the probability @xmath11 of an outcome @xmath7 given a state @xmath2 indicates whether such an outcome is possible ( in which case the probability is different from @xmath0 ) or not ( the probability equals  @xmath0 ) .",
    "this formulation of quantum mechanics , despite being extremely successfull in its applications , has been problematic from almost its beginning .",
    "these difficulties , symbolized by the einstein - podolsy - rosen argument @xcite , come from the use of wave functions , that is the fact that a pure quantum state is represented in the quantum theory by a vector in the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "problematic aspects include the question whether such a representation is complete , that is wether such a formalism provides a complete description of the state of a quantum system .",
    "if this were the case , then this would mean that in our description of the world , some fundamental assumptions should be given up , such as determinism ( the state of a quantum system does not in general specify precisely the outcome of a measurement but only the probability to obtain it ) or locality ( with the possibility of direct and instantaneous influence between distant objects ) .",
    "a lot of literature has been devoted to these question with , in particular , the study of the possibility of some `` hidden - variable '' theories , where the description of the state of a quantum system is complemented by some extra elements of information .",
    "however , some major results have shown that such hidden variables theories are not possible under reasonable assumptions .",
    "the most central ones are the kochen - specker theorem @xcite , the gleason s theorem @xcite and bell s theorem @xcite .    however ,",
    "while these theorems show that some ways to solve the problem are impossible , the situation remains rather unsatisfactory , as illustrated by the never - ending wealth of publications on the subject .    in the present article",
    ", we attempt to provide some new insights regarding these questions by developing a different approach for representing knowledge about the state of a quantum system .",
    "the key word here is  knowledge \" : we deliberatly do not try to describe what the state actually is , but instead we attempt to describe what we do know about a state of a quantum system . in other words , our formalism is based on the use of actual elements of information , by which we mean results of actually performable measurement operations . in the case of quantum mechanics",
    ", this corresponds to outcomes of finite measures ( we must only consider finite ones since one can only manipulate and deal with a finite amount of information ) .",
    "however , in order to be as generic as possible , we will use the formalism of orthomodular lattices which constitute a more general algebraic formalism ( one can refer for instance to @xcite for more information ) .",
    "we start by defining the entities which will model to finite measures . in the hilbert framework",
    ", this corresponds to the eigenvalues of a hermitian operator with finitely many eigenvalues .",
    "more generally , this can be expressed as a maximal collection of mutually orthogonal subspaces of a hilbert space which can , more generally , be replaced by elements of an orthomodular lattice . another way to represent such a finite measurement",
    "is given by a boolean subalgebra of our orthomodular lattice , which is the subalgebra spanned by the previous elements .",
    "next , we define our representation formalism by means of functions which , given a finite measurement , indicate some outcomes which are ruled out by the experimental setup , that is which have a probability of @xmath0 .",
    "however , we do not demand that all outcomes with a zero probability should be ruled out and , more importantly , we do not demand that our functions indicate which will be the actual outcome .",
    "such functions will be called _ partial descriptions _ , where the adjective `` partial '' follows from the fact that they only provide partial information about the outcome of a measurement .",
    "we then define an equivalent way to represent partial descriptions , using what we call sasaki filters , and study some general results concerning the collection of all sasaki filters of a given orthomodular lattice .",
    "in particular , we show that they form a complete atomic lattice .",
    "finally , we focus on the study of sasaki filters in the case where our orthomodular lattice is a hilbert lattice , that is the lattice made of all closed subspaces of a hilbert space . more precisely , we will focus on atomic sasaki filters which we call  partial states \" .",
    "if the corresponding hilbert space is of dimension @xmath12 , we show that partial states are such that they provide a definite answer for every possible measurement , which contrasts deeply with the situation in orthodox quantum mechanics where a state is represented by a vector ray which encode the outcome of exactly one possible measurement . in dimension",
    "at least @xmath13 , we show two results :    1 .   quantum states ( i.e. one - dimensional subspaces ) can be seen partial states , 2 .",
    "there are partial states which do not correspond to quantum states .",
    "the latter is a very significant result , since it shows that our formalism , which is exclusively based on results of actually performable measurement , permits to consider descriptions of a quantum system which are strictly more expressive than those provided by the orthodox formalism .",
    "the basic example of a finite measurement is , in the hilbert space framework , provided by hermitian operators with finitely many eigenvalues ( i.e. finitely many outcomes ) .",
    "with such a hermitian operator , to each possible outcome can be associated an eigenspace , which is a closed subspace of the hilbert space modelling our quantum system . moreover , these eigenspaces are pairwise orthogonal and their sum equals the whole hilbert space .",
    "our first definition of a finite measurement , based on elements of an orthomodular lattice , directly follows from these considerations .",
    "a _ finite measurement _ of an orthomodular lattice @xmath14 is a finite collection @xmath15 verifying : @xmath16 let @xmath17 denote the collection of finite measurement of @xmath14",
    ".    given two finite measurements @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath18 , we say that @xmath6 is finer than @xmath18 and denote this by @xmath19 if  : @xmath20 it can be easily shown that , as suggested by the notation , @xmath21 defines a partial order on @xmath17 .    for all @xmath22 , if @xmath19",
    ", then one has : @xmath23    since @xmath19 , one only needs to prove the uniqueness of @xmath24 . but suppose that there are two distinct elements of @xmath18 , namely @xmath25 and @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . from the definition of a finite measurement , one has @xmath29 and thus @xmath30 . combined with the fact that @xmath28 , this implies that @xmath31 , which is not possible .",
    "this proposition suggests to define for all pairs @xmath32 of finite measurement such that @xmath19 a function @xmath33 with maps an element @xmath34 of @xmath6 to the unique element @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .      in order to present different approaches to our partial representations of states",
    ", we introduce some notations regarding boolean subalgebras .    given an orthomodular lattice @xmath14 ,",
    "let @xmath37 denote the collection of finite boolean subalgebras of @xmath14 .",
    "there is an obvious relation between finite measurements and finite boolean subalgebras , since given a finite measurement @xmath6 , one can define a finite boolean subalgebra by @xmath38 .",
    "conversely , given a finite boolean subalgebra , the set of its atoms forms a finite measurement .",
    "we also define the following projection operator on finite boolean subalgebras , which will play a role similar to that of @xmath39 for elements of @xmath17 :    given a finite boolean subalgebra @xmath40 , we define the projection @xmath41 on @xmath42 by  : @xmath43",
    "as explained in the introduction , our goal is to develop a way to describe ( possibly partially ) a quantum state by using only elements corresponding to actual knowledge , that is by results of actually realizable experiments .    in quantum mechanics",
    ", this corresponds to using eigenspaces of hermitian operators or , equivalently , closed subspaces of the hilbert space describing our system .",
    "more abstractly , this corresponds to elements of the associated hilbert lattice .",
    "our partial descriptions will then be defined as follows : given an actually realizable experiment , that is in our context a finite measurement , a partial description provides information about its expected result .",
    "imposing that our description should precisely give the outcome of any measurement seems an unreasonably strong requirement ( it is actually impossible , as it follows from results such as the kochen - specker theorem or the generalization presented by the author in @xcite .",
    "we will develop on this impossibility later in the article ) .",
    "instead , we demand a weaker condition : that , given a finite measurement , it tells which outcomes may occur or , considering the complement , it provides a list of outcomes which have a probability equal to @xmath0",
    ".    it should be remarked at this point that we only impose that those outcomes which are considered as impossible should have a probability of @xmath0 .",
    "that means that some outcomes may be considered as possible even though they have a probability of @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "a partial description provides informations about which outcomes will not occur , and not about which outcomes will .",
    "following the previous discussion , we define a _ partial description _ as a function @xmath44 which associates to each finite measurement @xmath6 a non - empty subset @xmath45 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath44 carries the following pieces of information : if measurement @xmath6 is performed on the quantum system , then the outcome will be an element of  @xmath46 .",
    "equivalently , in terms of finite boolean subalgebras , a partial description can be defined on boolean subalgebras as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the partial description composed of the atoms of @xmath42 .",
    "one then has : @xmath49 conversely , @xmath50 , so that one can express partial descriptions equivalently in terms of finite measurements or of finite sub - boolean algebras .",
    "it seems that no confusion can be made regarding these two ways to consider partial descriptions , so that in the following , we will denote the two functions the same way .    in the previous section ,",
    "we have introduced a partial order relation between partial measurements . in order to reflect this relation on partial descriptions , we demand the following requirement : @xmath51 this condition , which may seem to be straightforward , deserves a closer examination . first , given two finite measures @xmath52 , if an element @xmath53 is considered as a possible outcome for @xmath6 with regards to a partial description @xmath44 , i.e. if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 has to be a possible outcome for @xmath56  : @xmath57 this can be rewritten has  : @xmath58 however , we require an equality and not just an inclusion .",
    "thus , we also demand that given an element @xmath24 of @xmath59 , there has to be an element @xmath54 such that @xmath60 .",
    "this condition is far from being obvious . on the contrary",
    ", it seems to us that it reflects an important feature of quantum physics : consider a system which , after performing a measurement @xmath61 , has its state lying in an eigenspace @xmath62 , and suppose that one performs another measurement @xmath63 compatible with @xmath61 ( that is their associated hermitian operators commute ) . without loss of generality , one can consider that every eigenspace of @xmath63 is included in one eigenspace of @xmath61 . in that case , after performing @xmath63 , the quantum system will have its state belong to an eigenspace @xmath64 with @xmath65 , in even though one can not , in general , tell which outcome will be obtained .",
    "this prediction can be made before performing @xmath63 and is a consequence of quantum theory .",

    "this situation is extremely different from that of a quantum state which , as we leave probabilites aside , indicates the exact result of only one measurement .",
    "not only quantum states can not be regarded as partial states , but partial states are infinitely more informative than quantum states .",
    "however , one can argue that the previous result is not extremely interesting , since a qubit or any system described by a hilbert space of dimension @xmath12 is actually part of a bigger system , described by a hilbert space of higher dimension , that is at least @xmath13 . and",
    "@xmath13 does precisely correspond to the least dimension in which both the kochen - specker theorem and the gleason s theorem hold @xcite .      in @xcite",
    ", the author has studied the relation that existed between partial descriptions ( refered to as `` a priori knowledge '' ) and the kochen - specker theorem which can be stated in terms of proper sasaki filters as :    given a hilbert space @xmath1 of dimension at least @xmath13 , there is no proper sasaki filter @xmath123 of @xmath179 which contains exactly one element of every maximal collection of mutually orthogonal atoms .",
    "however , the formulation in terms of proper sasaki filters also provides a generalization of thie result . quoting theorem 7 in @xcite",
    ", we have :    given a hilbert space @xmath1 of dimension at least @xmath13 and an atom @xmath183 of @xmath179 , if proper sasaki filter @xmath123 of @xmath179 contains @xmath183 , then @xmath199 .",
    "this result shows that , contrary to what happened in dimension @xmath12 , given an atom @xmath183 of @xmath14 , the sasaki filter @xmath200 is a partial state .",
    "stated another way , to a quantum state @xmath201 can be associated a partial state @xmath202 which we call a _ principal partial state_.    the next question is now : are there partial states which are not principal ?",
    "are there partial states which do not correspond to quantum states ?",
    "the next subsection will give a positive answer to this question .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hilbert lattice of dimension at least @xmath13 and let @xmath203 be an orthomodular basis of @xmath1 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath204 has a particular element , denoted @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we define a set @xmath205 of unitary vectors of @xmath1 by : @xmath206 it is easy to verify that @xmath205 is a collection of mutually non - orthogonal vectors , since  : @xmath207 now , let us define @xmath208 .",
    "one  has :    [ prop : counterexample ] the set @xmath209 is a sasaki filter of @xmath179 and there is no principal maximal sasaki filter of @xmath179 containing @xmath210 .",
    "the fact that @xmath210 is a sasaki filter follows from the fact that the elements of @xmath205 are mutually non - orthogonal . as a consequence , the elements of @xmath211 are mutually incompatible so that if @xmath212 , then @xmath213 .    now",
    ", suppose that there is an element @xmath214 such that @xmath215 .",
    "this means that for all @xmath7 in @xmath204 , one has @xmath216 or equivalently that @xmath217 .",
    "in particular , @xmath218 and for @xmath7 in @xmath219 , one has  : @xmath220 this leads to a contradiction , since we assumed that @xmath221 , and as the span of our orthonormal basis @xmath222 is dense in @xmath1 , one has @xmath223 so that @xmath224 .    given a hilbert lattice @xmath1 of dimension at least @xmath13 , there are partial states of @xmath179 which are not principal .",
    "this is a direct consequence of propositions [ prop : atomicsf ] and [ prop : counterexample ] .",
    "in our attempt to develop a formalism for representing knowledge about the state of a quantum system by solely using actual results of measurements , we have introduced _ partial descriptions _ which , given a performable measurement , provides informations about the expected outcome by discarding some values which are known to be impossible .    in a more general and algebraic approach",
    ", we have defined this formalism by using orthomodular lattices ( which are a generalization of the collection of closed subspaces of a hilbert space ) and have shown that partial descriptions could be represented by _",
    "sasaki filters_. then , by studying some structural properties of the collection of all sasaki filters of a given orthomodular lattice , we have shown in particular that it forms an atomic complete lattice .",
    "the atomicity is especially interesting , as it shows the existence of `` maximal '' partial descriptions ( maximal in the sense that it is not possible to find a partial description providing strictly more information ) which we call _ partial states _ together with the fact that any partial description can be seen as an approximation of a partial state ( or , stated the other way , that any partial description can be refined into a partial state ) .",
    "finally , by comparing partial states to quantum states ( represented by 1-dimensional subspaces of a hilbert space or , more algebraically , by atoms of an orthomodular lattice ) , we have shown that , in dimension @xmath12 or more ( even though the situation is different in dimension @xmath12 and in greater dimension ) , the formalism of partial states is strictly more expressive that the orthodox notion of quantum state .      from an operational point of view ,",
    "the basic components of partial descriptions are outcomes of feasible measurements .",
    "however , partial descriptions provide information about any measurements , even non - compatible ones .",
    "now , since it is not possible to perform non - compatible measurements , this means that , even if partial descriptions do correspond to some `` elements of reality '' , they would not be entirely accessible experimentally .",
    "more importantly , should one consider all partial descriptions and all partial states as legitimate , or should one only consider some of them ? following from the study of the structure of the collection of all sasaki filters of a given orthomodular lattice , it is clear that considering a hilbert space @xmath1 and the associated hilbert lattice @xmath179 , any partial state of the form @xmath225 with @xmath183 an atom of @xmath179 should be considered , as it constitutes a partial description corresponding to an orthodox quantum state .",
    "the question which follows is then , are there other partial descriptions which should be considered as legitimate ?                                isar stubbe and bart van steirteghem , _ propositional systems , hilbert lattices and generalized hilbert spaces _ ,",
