    "thermally driven diffusive motion belongs to the fundamental physical processes . to a big extent inspired by the groundbreaking experiments of robert brown in the 1820ies @xcite the theoretical foundations of the theory of diffusion",
    "were then laid by einstein , sutherland , smoluchowski , and langevin between 1905 and 1908 @xcite . on their basis novel experiments , such as the seminal works by perrin and nordlund @xcite , in turn delivered ever better quantitative information on molecular diffusion as well as the atomistic nature of matter .",
    "typically , we now identify two fundamental properties with brownian diffusive processes : ( i ) the linear growth in time of the mean squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is called the diffusion coefficient , and ( ii ) the gaussian shape @xmath2 of the probability density function @xmath3 to find the diffusing particle at position @xmath4 at some time @xmath5 @xcite . from a more mathematical viewpoint",
    "the gaussian emerges as limit distribution of independent , identically distributed random variables ( the steps of the random walk ) with finite variance and in that sense assumes a universal character @xcite .",
    "deviations from the linear time dependence ( [ msd ] ) are routinely observed .",
    "thus , modern microscopic techniques reveal _ anomalous diffusion _ with the power - law dependence @xmath6 of the msd , where according to the value of the anomalous diffusion exponent we distinguish subdiffusion for @xmath7 and superdiffusion with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "examples for subdiffusion of passive molecular and submicron tracers abound in the cytoplasm of living biological cells @xcite and in artificially crowded fluids @xcite , as well as in quasi two - dimensional systems such as lipid bilayer membranes @xcite .",
    "superdiffusion is typically associated with active processes and also observed in living cells @xcite .",
    "anomalous diffusion processes arise due to the loss of independence of the random variables , divergence of the variance of the random variables or the mean of the step time distribution , as well as due to the tortuosity of the embedding space",
    ". the associated probability density function of anomalous diffusion processes may have both gaussian and non - gaussian shapes @xcite .",
    "a new class of diffusive dynamics has recently been reported in a number of soft matter , biological and other complex systems : in these processes the msd is gaussian of the form ( [ msd ] ) , however , the probability density function @xmath9 is non - gaussian , typically characterised by a distinct exponential shape @xmath10 with the decay length @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this form of the probability density function is also sometimes called a laplace distribution .",
    "the brownian yet non - gaussian feature appears quite robustly in a large range of systems , including beads diffusing on lipid tubes @xcite or in networks @xcite , tracer motion in colloidal , polymeric , or active suspensions @xcite , in biological cells @xcite , as well as the motion of individuals in heterogeneous populations such as nematodes @xcite . for additional examples",
    "see @xcite and the references in @xcite .",
    "how can this combination of normal , brownian scaling of the mean squared displacement be reconciled with the existence of a non - gaussian probability density function ?",
    "one argument not brought forth in the discussion of anomalous diffusion above is the possibility that the random variables making up the observed dynamics are indeed not identically distributed .",
    "this fact can be introduced in different ways .",
    "first , granick and co - workers @xcite as well as hapca et al .",
    "@xcite employed distributions of the diffusivity of individual tracer particles to explain this remarkable behaviour : indeed , averaging the gaussian probability density function ( [ gauss ] ) for a single diffusivity @xmath1 over the exponential distribution @xmath12 with the mean diffusivity @xmath13 , the exponential form ( [ expo ] ) of the probability density function emerges @xcite .",
    "in fact , this idea of creating an ensemble behaviour in terms of distributions of diffusivities of individual tracer particles is analogous to the concept of superstatistical brownian motion : based on two statistical levels describing , respectively , the fast jiggly dynamics of the brownian particle and the slow environmental fluctuations with spatially local patches of given diffusivity this concept demonstrates how non - gaussian probability densities arise physically @xcite . in what follows",
    "we refer to averaging over a diffusivity distribution @xmath14 as superstatistical approach .",
    "second , chubinsky and slater came up with the diffusing diffusivity model , in which the diffusion coefficient of the tracer particle evolves in time like the coordinate of a brownian particle in a gravitational field @xcite . for short times",
    "they indeed find an exponential form ( [ expo ] ) . at long times , they demonstrate from simulations that the probability density function crosses over to a gaussian shape .",
    "jan and sebastian formalise the diffusing diffusivity model in an elegant path integral approach , which they explictly solve in two spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "their results are consistent with those of ref .  @xcite .    here",
    "we introduce a simple yet powerful minimal model for diffusing diffusivities , based on the concept of subordination .",
    "based on a double langevin equation approach our model is fully analytical , providing an explicit solution for the probability density function in fourier space .",
    "the inversion is easily feasible numerically , and we demonstrate excellent agreement with simulations of the underlying stochastic equations .",
    "moreover , we provide the analytical expressions for the asymptotic behaviour at short and long times .",
    "the bivariate fokker - planck equation for this process and its connection to the subordination concept are established .",
    "finally , we show that in the short time limit our analytical results are fully consistent with the superstatistical approach .",
    "our approach has the distinct advantage that it is amenable to a large variety of different fluctuating diffusion scenarios .    in what follows we",
    "first formulate the coupled langevin equations for the diffusing diffusivity model .",
    "section 3 then introduces the subordination concept allowing us to derive the exact form of the subordinator as well as the fourier image of the probability density function . the brownian form of the msd",
    "is demonstrated and the short and long time limits derived .",
    "moreover , the connection to the superstatistical approach is made .",
    "the kurtosis quantifying the non - gaussian shape of the probability density function is derived . in section 4 the bivariate fokker - planck equation for the joint probability density function @xmath15",
    "is analysed , before drawing our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we start with the combined set of stochastic equations    @xmath16    here , expression ( [ lang1 ] ) designates the well - known overdamped langevin equation driven by white gaussian noise @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , we consider the diffusion coefficient @xmath18 to be a random function of time .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath18 is specified by equations ( [ lang2 ] ) and ( [ lang3 ] ) .",
    "note that the choice of expressing @xmath18 as the square of the auxiliary variable @xmath19 guarantees the positivity , avoiding the need to impose boundary conditions on the process @xmath18 .",

    "the stochastic equation ( [ lang3 ] ) contains a linear restoring term , corresponding to the motion of the process @xmath23 in a centred harmonic potential .",
    "the formal solution of this ornstein - uhlenbeck process reads @xmath24 the associated autocorrelation function is @xmath25 thus , for long times ( @xmath26 ) , we find the exponential decay @xmath27 of the autocorrelation , and thus the variance @xmath28    we note that the fokker - planck equation for this ornstein - uhlenbeck process reads @xmath29 for a @xmath30-shaped initial condition , the distribution @xmath31 remains gaussian at all times , and it converges to the equilibrium boltzmann form @xmath32 with the variance @xmath33 .",
    "subordination is an important concept in probability theory @xcite",
    ". simply put , a subordinator associates a random time increment with the number of steps the subordinated stochastic process . for instance , continuous time random walks with power - law distributions of waiting times can be described as a brownian motion in terms of the number of jumps of the process , while the random waiting times are introduced in terms of a lvy stable subordinator , as originally formulated by fogedby @xcite and developed as a stochastic representation of the fractional fokker - planck equation and generalised master equations for continuous time random walk models by friedrich and coworkers @xcite .    here",
    "we apply and extend the subordination concept to a new class of random diffusivity based stochastic processes .",
    "our results for our minimal model of diffusive diffusivities demonstrates that the subordination approach leads to a superstatistical solution at times shorter than typical diffusivity correlation times .    to start with",

    "in this section we derive the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the set of stochastic equations ( [ lang1 ] ) to ( [ lang3 ] ) of our diffusing diffusivity model .",
    "we will also establish the relation to the subordination approach of section [ sec_subord ] .",

    "the corresponding system of stochastic equations has the form    @xmath95    and thus the bivariate fokker - planck equation governing the probability density @xmath94 reads @xmath96 now we introduce an ansatz for the solution of equation ( [ fpe ] ) of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the gaussian probability density given by equation ( [ green ] ) . then , in accordance with equation ( [ marginal ] ) the marginal probability density @xmath34 can be written in the subordination form of equation ( [ subord ] ) , where @xmath99 is the marginal probability density function of the integrated square of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process whose laplace transform is given by equation ( [ subord_square ] ) .",

    "therefore we showed that the solution of the bivariate fokker - planck equation ( [ fpe ] ) can be presented in the form ( [ ansatz ] ) , and consequently the marginal probability density function @xmath34 can be written in the subordination form ( [ subord ] ) .",
    "the connection of the bivariate fokker - planck equation ( [ fpe ] ) for the langevin system ( [ lang1 ] ) to ( [ lang3 ] ) with the subordination approach represented by relations ( [ subo ] ) and ( [ subord ] ) is our fourth main result .",
    "an increasing number of systems are reported in which the mean squared displacement is linear in time , suggesting the brownian motion of the observed tracer particles . concurrently",
    "the ( displacement ) probability density function is pronouncedly non - gaussian . brownian but exponential dynamics was previously explained in a superstatistical approach by granick and coworkers @xcite .",
    "chubinsky and slater @xcite introduced the diffusing diffusivity model and studied it numerically , concluding the crossover from the exponential shape to a gaussian with effective diffusivity .",
    "jain and sebastian go further with the double langevin approach @xcite . here",
    "we introduced a consistent minimal model for a diffusing diffusivity .",
    "we explicitly obtain the fourier transform of the full probability density function , from which we obtain the analytical short and long time limits .",
    "this allows us to derive explicitly the long time gaussian shape of the probability density .",
    "moreover we demonstrate a full consistency of our minimal model with the superstatistical approach , as well as with the results of jain and sebastian ( appendix [ appb ] ) . finally , we phrase our model in terms of a subordination concept , endowing our model with an extremely flexible basis , such that a wide range of different statistics for the diffusivity can be included .",
    "we also obtained the bivariate fokker - planck equation for this diffusing diffusivity process and expressed its solution in terms of the subordination integral .",
    "excellent agreement with simulations is provided for the probability density function , the brownian scaling of the mean squared displacement , and the kurtosis of the probability density function .",
    "we are confident that this subordination integral formulation of the diffusing diffusivity model will prove useful for experimentalists observing such dynamics , as well as for theoreticians aiming at expanding this relatively simple model .",
    "possible generalisations may include diffusing diffusivity models with time dependent effective diffusivity @xcite or non - gaussian anomalous viscoelastic diffusion in crowded membranes @xcite , which contrasts gaussian anomalous viscoelastic diffusion in non - crowded membranes @xcite .",
    "for the case of anomalous diffusion we note that an exponential ( laplace ) distribution of the form @xmath104^{1/2})$ ] was recently observed for the motion of messenger rna molecules in living e.coli and s.cerevisiae cells @xcite .",

    "let us put the diffusing diffusivity approach into context with other popular models with distributed transport coefficients .",
    "typically these are constructed to describe anomalous diffusion processes .",
    "a by now classical model is scaled brownian motion , in which the diffusivity is a deterministic , power - law function of time @xcite . on a stochastic level",
    "scaled brownian motion appears naturally in granular gases @xcite , in which non - ideal collisions effect a decrease of the system s temperature ( kinetic energy ) .",
    "scaled brownian motion is non - ergodic and displays a massively delayed overdamping transition @xcite .",
    "heterogeneous diffusion processes employ a continuous , deterministic space dependence of the diffusivity and lead to non - ergodic and ageing dynamics @xcite . in contrast to these models",
    "random diffusivity approaches also have a considerably history .",
    "thus segregation in solids in the context of radiation was described by such an approach @xcite , and brownian motion in media with fluctuating friction coefficient , temperature fluctuations , or randomly interrupted diffusion were used to describe , for instance , randomly stratified media @xcite .",
    "a random diffusivity approach was elaborated to consider light scattering in a continuous medium with fluctuating dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "motivated by the comparison of diffusion processes assessed by different modern measurement techniques , the concept of _ microscopic single - particle diffusivity _ was developed @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the diffusivity varies randomly but is constant on patches of random sizes .",
    "such random patch model show non - ergodic subdiffusion due to the diffusivity effectively changing at random times with a heavy - tailed distribution .",
    "finally , we mention that a deterministic time dependence of the diffusivity was combined with a random diffusivity in @xcite .",

    "<S> a growing number of biological , soft , and active matter systems are observed to exhibit normal diffusive dynamics with a linear growth of the mean squared displacement , yet with a non - gaussian distribution of increments . </S>",
    "<S> based on the chubinsky - slater idea of a diffusing diffusivity we here establish and analyse a complete minimal model framework of diffusion processes with fluctuating diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate the equivalence of the diffusing diffusivity process in the short time limit with a superstatistical approach based on a distribution of diffusivities . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we establish a subordination picture of brownian but non - gaussian diffusion processes , that can be used for a wide class of diffusivity fluctuation statistics . </S>",
