    "the stability of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) at physiological temperature is due to the self - assembly of its base pairs : self - assembly within a same strand _ via _ base - stacking interactions between neighboring bases ; and self - assembly of both strands _ via _ hydrogen bonds between pairs of complementary bases .",
    "these interactions , however .",
    "are on the order of magnitude of a few @xmath0 ( thermal energy )  @xcite and thermal fluctuations can lead , even at physiological temperature , to local and transitory unzipping of the double strand ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite or the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "the cooperative opening of a sequence of consecutive base pairs leads to denaturation bubbles which are likely to play a role from a biological perspective , since they may participate in mechanisms such as replication , transcription or protein binding .",
    "for example , it has been proposed  @xcite that transcription start and regulatory sites could be related to dna regions which have a higher probability of promoting bubbles .",
    "indeed , the energy needed to break an adenine - thymine ( a - t ) base pair @xmath1 , connected by two hydrogen bonds , is smaller than the energy needed to break a guanine - cytosine ( g - c ) one @xmath2 ( 3 hydrogen bonds )  @xcite . at the same temperature , a - t rich sequences present _ a priori _ more bubbles than g - c rich ones , even though sequence effects on the occurrence of bubbles are more complex than a simple examination of local a - t base abundance  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sequence , the fraction of denaturation bubbles _ in vitro _ naturally depends on temperature , as well as on the ionic strength of the solution  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the melting temperature @xmath3 , above which bubbles proliferate and the two strands completely separate , depends on both sequence and ionic strength .",
    "another parameter that affects the melting temperature is the length of the double strand  @xcite .",
    "this is not a purely academic debate because short dna strands ( a few tens of base pairs ) are involved in dna chip experiments where the hybridization process is precisely affected by temperature in a way depending on strand length and sequence ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the intracellular unwinding of dna is due to active and enzymatic processes by imposing unwinding torsional stresses  @xcite , the thermally induced denaturation of purified dna in solution has led to an intensive study of dna thermal denaturation  @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic models have been proposed to account for the thermodynamical properties of denaturation bubbles in dna .",
    "the first models were ising - like two - state models , where the base pairs can be open or closed ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in the simple base - pair model ,",
    "the ising parameters are the base - pair chemical potential and the so - called cooperativity parameter , which accounts for the energetic cost of a domain wall .",
    "this type of one - dimensional ising model is exactly soluble for homopolymers and for random sequences  @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated effective ising models , including the 10 kinds of base - pair doublets , lead to better agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "poland and scheraga  @xcite , following the work of zimm  @xcite , included  loop entropy \" in these models , i.e. the entropic cost of closing large loops formed by destacked single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) in bubbles  @xcite .",
    "this poland - scheraga model is at the core of the dna melting simulator meltsim algorithm first developed by blake _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . the intra - loop and",
    "inter - loop self - avoidance corrects the loop statistics and refines the sharpness of the denaturation transition  @xcite . to get a denaturation transition in these models , an effective temperature dependent ising chemical potential",
    "must be inserted by hand .",
    "recently , peyrard _ et al . _ developed non - linear phonon models where the shape of the interaction potential between base pairs is more precisely taken into account ( see  @xcite and the review  @xcite ) . by inserting estimated microscopic parameters , they have shown that their model can both lead to a denaturation transition , analogous to interface unbinding , and be useful for studying bubble dynamics .",
    "the predicted transition temperature is , however , very sensitive to the model parameter values , and if physically reasonable values are used  @xcite , @xmath3 appears to be much too high and the transition width much too large .    more generally , the theoretical study of dna denaturation can in principle be tackled on a least four levels of investigation determined by the amount of detail included , going from ( 1 ) quantum _ ab initio _ approaches and ( 2 ) classical all atom molecular dynamical simulations  @xcite , through ( 3 ) effective mesoscopic approaches coupling chain conformational and base - pair degrees of freedom  @xcite , to ( 4 ) effective statistical models for base - pairs alone  ( @xcite and references therein ) . in theory , it is possible to move up one step in this hierarchy by integrating out the subset of the degrees of freedom that do not appear at the higher level , giving rise to en effective free energy at each level of description . our purpose here is to show , _ via _ a minimal model for dna homopolymers , that if one starts at the third level and integrates out the chain degrees of freedom , one arrives at a physically coherent level ( 4 ) explanation for the dna melting transition : a bending free energy driven denaturation transition emerges naturally due to the entropic lowering of the energetic barrier for bubble nucleation .",
    "working at level ( 3 ) also has the added advantage of allowing access to the statistics of the chain degrees of freedom ( effective persistence length , mean - square - radius , etc . ) , something that obviously is not possible at level ( 4 ) .",
    "to this end , we have recently proposed a model  @xcite , which considers not only the internal coordinates in terms of ising spin variables describing the open or closed states , but also external coordinates , the chain tangent vectors , which determine the chain configuration and depend sensitively on chain stiffness .",
    "indeed , ssdna is two orders of magnitude more flexible than dsdna at normal salt concentration .",
    "we have shown that this difference in bending rigidity provides a novel explanation for the bubble mechanism formation .",
    "further evidence for the importance of this bending heterogeneity include phenomena such as cyclization , loop formation , and packaging of dna into nucleosomes  @xcite ( where denaturation bubbles facilitate bending of the otherwise rigid polymer dna in structures where it coils up with curvature radii down to 10  nm , despite a persistence length of dsdna equal to 50  nm ) .",
    "our model incorporates precisely this dependence of the polymer bending rigidity on the state of neighboring base pairs .",
    "it is the discretized version of a continuous model  @xcite , and couples explicitly an ising model , describing the internal degrees of freedom ( open or closed ) , and a heisenberg or discrete worm like chain ( dwlc ) one , accounting for the rotational degrees of freedom between successive monomers of the dna chain .",
    "its originality lies in the fact that the internal 2-state and external bending degrees of freedom are treated on an equal footing and therefore the renormalized ising parameters obtained by integrating out the chain can be exactly calculated within the scope of the model .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath3 naturally emerges and , together with the transition width @xmath4 , are explicitly written as a function of the bending rigidities and strand length , which are experimentally known , and bare ising parameters .",
    "in addition , the effective ising properties ( fraction of broken bases and correlation length ) as well as the chain ones ( persistence length and mean square radius ) can be computed , allowing in principle direct comparison with experiments . an important feature of this effective ising model is that the end monomers see an effective chemical potential that is lower than the interior one ; this end - interior asymmetry leads in a natural way to a chain length dependence for @xmath3 , the transition width , and other statistical quantities .",
    "a similar model had been previously proposed by one of us in 2d  @xcite , but its application to the study of denaturation bubbles in dsdna was not made explicit . recently",
    ", a similar approach has been considered in the context of the dsdna stretching transition  @xcite .",
    "the addition in the energy functional of the term corresponding to the external force prevents an exact solution of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite and an approximate variational scheme had to be implemented .    beyond dsdna or dsrna",
    ", our coupled model can be used to describe the properties of any two - state biopolymer , as soon as the local bending rigidity depends on the local states .",
    "as already mentioned , the transition from b- to s - form of dsdna in force experiments has been investigated in this framework  @xcite . the helix - coil transition in poly - peptides",
    "can also be described by such a theory because the @xmath5-helix configuration is much more rigid than the random one  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is a detailed account of the results summarized in a letter  @xcite . in section  [ dsm ] , we present the coupled classical ising - heisenberg model , which , as we show here , can be used to describe dna thermal denaturation and write the partition function in terms of a transfer matrix , usual in one - dimensional statistical systems .",
    "we note in passing that the coupled ising - heisenberg model presented here displays a rich array of behavior and therefore may be of interest in other contexts , such 1d classical spin chains or 0d quantum rotators describing a diatomic molecule with internal states .    because the full transfer matrix method for the coupled model leads to relatively complex calculations ,",
    "we first show that the model can be reduced to two effective ising models , a path that provides a great deal of physical insight : indeed , these effective models allow the calculation of the free energy , as well as the ising and chain end - to - end tangent - tangent correlation functions in terms of an effective hamiltonian with temperature - dependent ising parameters . a detailed solution of the two effective models is provided in section  [ solising ] .",
    "section  [ corr ] is devoted to the calculation of the ising and chain correlation quantities , using the effective ising models , as well as a novel correlator mixing both ising and chain variables .",
    "the next sections , [ tm ] and  [ rg ] , present in detail the full transfer matrix approach , which leads to the complete calculation of chain correlations and end - to - end distance ; a visual interpretation of the expression for the 2-point correlation functions leads naturally to an analogy with a quantum diatomic molecule .",
    "our theory is compared to experimental denaturation profiles of synthetic dna in section  [ dna ] and finite - size effects , which are experimentally relevant , are thoroughly examined in section  [ finite : size ] .",
    "finally , our concluding remarks are given in section  [ cl ] , where we also summarize our principal theoretical results of greatest interest for interpreting experiments .",
    "the principal symbols used in this work are defined and catalogued in table  [ table1 ] at the end of the paper .",
    "we model dsdna as a discrete chain of @xmath6 monomers ( links ) , each monomer can be in one of two different states , u and b , which denote , respectively , unbroken and broken bonds .",
    "the local chain rigidity depends on the nearby link types . a denaturation bubble is thus formed by a consecutive sequence of b type monomers .",
    "the chain s conformational properties are determined by the set of @xmath6 unit link tangent vectors @xmath7 with @xmath8 . for simplicity ,",
    "the monomer length , @xmath9 , is taken to be the same for both u and b ( for modeling dna stretching transitions it is necessary to introduce different monomer lengths  @xcite ) .",
    "the position of the end of the @xmath10 link in the 3d embedding space is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an arbitrary starting point .",
    "the end - to - end vector is @xmath13 .",
    "the link states are denoted by the value of an ising variable @xmath14 ( u or b ) associated with each link .",
    "these ising variables allow us to model a system of thermally activated defects such as the broken bonds that proliferate on certain macromolecules like dna when the temperature is raised . in this case",
    "the temperature - dependent concentration of broken bonds is controlled by an appropriately defined chemical potential . because we are interested here in the new phenomena that arise due to the coupling between the internal ( ising ) and external ( chain conformational ) degrees of freedom , we will not attempt to take into account at the same time the self - avoidance of the chain .    after presenting the model",
    "we explain how to calculate the partition and correlation functions connected with both the internal and external degrees of freedom for the coupled model .",
    "once we have these quantities for the coupled ising - chain system , we will be able to compare the results for the coupled system with those for the uncoupled one .",
    "we will see that the coupling can strongly modify the results , namely the average properties of the system at a given temperature in terms of the average concentration of closed and open bonds , average mean square chain radius and 2-point correlation functions .",
