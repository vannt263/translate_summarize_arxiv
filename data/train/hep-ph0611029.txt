    "due to their high accuracy , data for single hadron inclusive production in high energy @xmath0 reactions have been used within the framework of the factorization theorem of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at leading twist and at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) to constrain fragmentation functions ( ffs ) for charge summed light charged hadrons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) in refs.@xcite .",
    "the benefits of such an extraction are twofold .",
    "first , a test of perturbative qcd is provided and consequently imposes a constraint on the strong coupling constant @xmath8 at the @xmath9 boson mass scale @xmath10 .",
    "second , since the universality principle of the factorization theorem implies that the ffs are independent of the initial state , ffs extracted in this way can be used to make predictions for other hadron production processes such as those arising from @xmath4 reactions in the current fragmentation region and from @xmath11 and @xmath12 reactions .",
    "tests of universality were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite by confronting predictions obtained from the kkp ff set @xcite with corresponding measurements of rapidity ( @xmath13 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath14 ) distributions for unidentified light charged hadron production in @xmath12 reactions at ua1 , ua2 and cdf , @xmath15 reactions at h1 and zeus , and @xmath16 reactions at opal . within the theoretical and experimental errors the description of all data sets was good . however , the predictions for the @xmath12 reactions have large theoretical errors arising from scale variations , and the experimental errors are largest at large @xmath14 where additional non - perturbative information such as higher twist is expected to be least important .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath16 reaction data suffer from similar problems , but in addition the predictions gain large errors from the rather badly constrained parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the photon .",
    "distributions in @xmath13 generally have even larger theoretical errors .",
    "more stringent tests of universality were performed in refs.@xcite through analysis of pseudorapidity and @xmath14 distributions from h1 for the process @xmath18 , and in ref .",
    "@xcite through analysis of @xmath14 distributions from zeus for the process @xmath19 , which did not require the use of photon pdfs ( except in the low @xmath2 region @xcite ) .",
    "the disagreement found with the zeus data was reduced in ref .",
    "@xcite through resummation of multiple parton radiation at low @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we confront predictions of normalized light charged hadron scaled momentum ( @xmath3 ) distributions with single hadron inclusive production measurements in deeply inelastic scattering at the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite experiments ( the more recent zeus data of ref .",
    "@xcite are unfortunately unavailable ) at high @xmath2 in the current fragmentation region , where the detected hadron originates from the fragmentation of a parton at high scale .",
    "these hadrons can be reliably distinguished from those in the target fragmentation region by working in the breit frame , where the struck quark , which subsequently fragments , moves in the opposite direction to the proton remnants , so that @xmath3 distributions in the current fragmentation region are closely related to @xmath3 distributions in any one of the two event hemispheres of @xmath0 reactions .",
    "consequently , comparison of predictions for @xmath4 reaction data using ffs constrained from @xmath0 reaction data allows for more direct tests of universality .",
    "since the data are normalized , uncertainties from the proton pdfs and their perturbative evolution are reduced , as well as the dependence on bjorken @xmath20 .",
    "the charge - squared weighted ffs are weighted equally in @xmath0 reactions .",
    "in particular , this implies that ffs for massless @xmath21 and @xmath22 quarks can not be separated if they are not separately tagged , so that , since no individually tagged light quark flavour data was used in the analyses of refs .  @xcite , additional theoretical constraints on the @xmath21 quark had to be imposed . however , calculation of hadron production processes from proton initiated reactions at facilities such as hera ( @xmath23 ) , the tevatron ( @xmath12 ) , rhic and the lhc ( @xmath24 ) , where the charge - squared weighted ffs for quarks of each flavour have an independent weighting provided by the pdfs , may demand some degree of knowledge of the individual quark ffs , particularly in the light quark sector .    in the determination of the akk ff set for light charged hadrons @xcite , a more phenomenological separation of the light quark flavour ffs was pursued using the individually quark flavour tagged probabilities measured by the opal collaboration @xcite .",
    "these probabilities were constrained by single and double hadron inclusive production measurements for which light quarks are favoured , together with the well justified theoretical assumptions of su(2 ) isospin invariance between @xmath25 and @xmath21 quarks for the quark compositions of @xmath5 , and the branching ratios of the @xmath9 boson into quark - antiquark pairs of each quark flavour from perturbative qcd .",
    "small @xmath3 subtleties in double hadron inclusive production are relatively unimportant since the data are in the range @xmath26 .",
    "such a separation should make little difference to the current knowledge of @xmath5 ffs , since the su(2 ) isospin relation was also used in the extraction of the kkp ff set to constrain the @xmath21 quark .",
    "thus , predictions for @xmath5 data should not depend too much on the choice of ff set .",
    "the same applies to unidentified light charged hadron data , albeit to a slightly less degree , since @xmath5 dominates the sample on account of its low mass .",
    "however , the anticipated strange quark suppression in @xmath6 production observed in the opal experiment gave more realistic @xmath6 production ffs for @xmath21 and @xmath22 quarks in the akk set than those in the kkp set , where the ff for @xmath22 was set equal to the ff for @xmath25 for simplicity .",
    "finally , the light quark separation of the akk ffs for @xmath7 production may also be significant , although it was limited by the large experimental uncertainties of the opal tagging probabilities .",
    "these expectations are found to some degree in the comparisons of theoretical predictions with @xmath24 initiated single hadron inclusive production data @xcite from the star collaboration . in ref .",
    "@xcite , both the akk and kkp ff sets lead to similar and good descriptions of the @xmath5 yield , while the theoretical prediction gives better agreement ( at scale @xmath27 ) with the measured @xmath7 production when the @xmath7 ffs are employed from the akk set than from the kkp set .",
    "the akk set for @xmath6 and @xmath28 @xcite also resulted in an improvement @xcite in the theoretical description of the @xmath28 production measurements of ref.@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the formalism behind our calculations in section [ tf ] .",
    "we define the observable we are studying , and give the form of the cross section in terms of the ffs to underline the similarities among , and differences between , single hadron inclusive production in @xmath0 and @xmath4 reactions .",
    "then we discuss the modification to the cross section when the detected hadron s mass is not negligible , since this effect is important at sufficiently small @xmath3 and low @xmath2 .",
    "section [ compdata ] contains our comparisons with the data , and we examine the uncertainties arising from the arbitrary choice of scale , of pdf set and of ff set , as well as the importance of gluon fragmentation and of the detected hadron mass effect .",
    "furthermore , although the corresponding data is absent , the contributions from the individual fragmenting parton and detected hadron species to the cross section are calculated to further determine differences and similarities of the ff sets . in section [ conc ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "finally , the appendix gives details on the cuts used in the experiments .",

    "consequently , in the absence of sufficiently precise data for @xmath4 reactions , @xmath67 ( or equivalently @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) tagging would therefore be valuable since together with @xmath0 reaction data it would provide some constraint on the separation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 quark fragmentation , by virtue of the difference between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "this contrasts with @xmath12 and @xmath24 reactions , where gluon fragmentation is very important because a gluon or quark from one ( anti)proton can probe a gluon from the other ( anti)proton directly and with a much stronger coupling .",
    "the production rate of the detected hadron falls as its mass @xmath74 increases due to the reduction in the size of the available phase space .",

    "the large deviation of the prediction for @xmath100 ( dotted line ) from the one for @xmath91 is caused by the vanishing of the @xmath68 quark ff below threshold .",
