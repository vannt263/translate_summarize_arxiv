    "if a binary mixture of fixed composition is brought into a coexistence state it will phase - separate into two pure phases , separated by an interface with a shape that minimizes the free energy of the system  @xcite .",
    "the phase with the smaller volume will typically organize itself into a compact shape , known as the equilibrium shape .",
    "if the surface tension ( excess free energy per unit interface area ) is isotropic , this equilibrium shape will be a sphere . if either of the co - existing phases is crystalline , the anisotropic surface tension will lead to an aspheric equilibrium crystal shape ( ecs ) .",
    "the ecs and the orientation dependence of the surface tension are intimately related .",
    "once the surface tension is known for all orientations , the so - called wulff construction  @xcite allows the generation of the ecs .",
    "the reverse is also possible ,",
    "i.e. , determining the surface tension as a function of orientation from the ecs ; this is a procedure followed in this manuscript .",
    "the ecs has been the subject of experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "one striking feature the ecs may show is a roughening transition : the disappearance of facets ( macroscopically flat surfaces ) under rising temperature . in practice equilibrium shapes",
    "are rarely seen and they are hard to produce experimentally , but this does not mean they are without practical importance . for example the presence or absence of facets in the ecs influences growth properties , such as the speed of growth and the growth mode , even though growth shapes may differ strongly from the ecs . in general , the determination of the orientation dependence of the surface tension is a tough problem .",
    "experimentally it is very difficult to measure , mainly due to equilibration problems .",
    "numerical studies suffer from the same equilibration problems , and in the most common simulation techniques each surface orientation requires a separate simulation .",
    "theoretical results only have been obtained for simplified models like the bcsos model  @xcite .    the prototypical model in which such properties are studied numerically , is the conserved - order - parameter ising model with nearest - neighbor interactions , in which the total magnetization is kept constant . in the two - dimensional ising model ,",
    "the ecs is a square at zero temperature , but at any finite temperature the ecs looses all flat faces .",
    "it gradually changes into a circle when the temperature is approaching the critical temperature . the behavior is richer in the three - dimensional ising model . at zero temperature ,",
    "the ecs is a cube . at finite temperatures below the roughening temperature @xmath2",
    ", the ecs still has macroscopically flat faces but the corners as well as the edges are rounded . above the roughening temperature",
    ", the ecs does no longer feature macroscopically flat faces .",
    "if the temperature is increased from the roughening temperature to the critical temperature , the ecs gradually approaches a sphere .",
    "an extension of the ising model is the potts model , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath3 in which @xmath4 is the coupling constant , @xmath5 denotes the kronecker delta function , and the summation runs over all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites , each having a spin with value @xmath6 .",
    "note that the two - state potts model is equivalent to the ising model .",
    "the topic of this manuscript is to study how the ecs and related properties such as the roughening temperature behave with increasing number of states .",
    "like in two dimensions the model undergoes a phase transition at a temperature we will refer to as the melting temperature @xmath7 . below this temperature",
    "the model has @xmath0 different phases , each of which is dominated by one of the @xmath0 possible spin values , whereas for temperatures above @xmath7 there is only a single phase in which on average all of the spin values are present in equal amounts .",
    "it is known that for @xmath8 the melting transition is of first order  @xcite , in contrast to the two - state ( ising ) case where the transition is continuous .",
    "it is therefore not clear _ a priori _ whether there is a roughening transition when @xmath9 , nor in how far the ecs should approach a sphere when @xmath10 approaches @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , one should expect the surface tension to approach a non - zero limit as the melting temperature is approached from below , whereas for continuous transitions it vanishes in this limit .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ se : ecs ] we outline the numerical procedure to efficiently determine the ecs and show the resulting shapes for all numbers of states for which accurate numerical estimates of the melting temperature have been reported : @xmath1 ( ising ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in section  [",
    "se : largeq ] we present some theoretical considerations on the behavior of the model for large values of @xmath0",
    ". section  [ se : tr ] covers the measurements on the location of the roughening transition . in section  [",
    "se : surftens ] we present the orientation - dependent surface tension as extracted from the data on the ecs .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results and an outlook to further research .",
    "equilibrium shapes can be determined numerically for the @xmath0-states potts model by forcing it into coexistence .",
    "this may be achieved by enforcing a constraint on the spin densities .",
    "the richest behavior is observed in case the maximum of @xmath13 constraints are enforced , but mostly the resulting configurations are still determined by the orientation dependence of the surface tension , and can thus be obtained indirectly from numerical simulations with a single constraint enforced .",
    "the constraint enforced in our simulations is the conservation of the density of state 1 , while the densities of all other states are allowed to fluctuate freely . to implement this , we combined a density - conserving cluster algorithm , described in a recent article  @xcite , with glauber dynamics  @xcite , constrained to never flip spins into or out of state 1 .",
    "we chose the ratio of cluster updates and glauber updates per site to be unity ( i.e. , a comparable amount of computational effort was spent to each ) .",
    "the run - times of the simulations varied between 400000 and 800000 monte",
    "carlo updates per site and we typically allowed the system to thermalize for 60000 to 100000 time steps .",
    "the lateral system size was 50 sites in all lattice directions , with periodic boundary conditions , and the fraction of conserved spins was typically @xmath14 . in order to directly obtain the ecs we repeatedly took `` snapshots '' of the evolving system , each time centering the cluster around the origin . taking the autocorrelation time into account , we typically obtained 2000 independent equilibrium snapshots from one simulation . at the end",
    "we calculated the time - averaged density profile of the conserved component .",
    "our results for the ecs were obtained from the 50% iso - density surface in this time - averaged density profile .    in figure",
    "[ shapes ] , we show the equilibrium crystal shapes for several temperatures , for the case of @xmath1 ( ising ) , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath12 states , respectively .",
    "these shapes are obtained from the 50% iso - density surface in the density profile , after full symmetrization , i.e. after we averaged over all 48 possible invariant mirror images of the cube .",
    "the simulation temperatures are chosen as fractions of the estimates for the melting temperatures reported in refs .",
    "@xcite ; these values are given in table  [ tatr ] .",
    "for large values of @xmath0 the thermal evolution of the ecs can be understood from the following arguments .",
    "first of all notice that at low temperatures the @xmath0 phases of the @xmath0-state potts model without conservation laws will be very close to the zero temperature phases in which all spins on the lattice have equal value . in @xmath18 dimensions",
    "the free energy per site @xmath19 of these states therefore satisfies @xmath20 the high temperature phase is completely dominated by the entropy resulting from the @xmath0 different occupation options for each site , with a resulting entropy per site of @xmath21 and free energy @xmath22 the melting temperature is obtained to a good approximation by equating these two expressions , with the result @xmath23 for large @xmath0 , with @xmath24 .",
    "note that for @xmath25 this is in agreement with the exact result  @xcite @xmath26 . for large @xmath0",
    "one sees that @xmath27 for temperatures below @xmath7",
    ". therefore local excitations , typically consisting of single overturned spins , will be extremely rare in the low temperature phases , as they require an energy far exceeding the gain in free energy due to the entropy increase .",
    "similarly the tendency to form clusters of equal spin in the high temperature phase is very weak , as the resulting gain of energy by far does not compensate the resulting loss of entropic free energy . as a result the melting transition for high @xmath0 will become very sharp .",
    "now we can also estimate the orientation dependence of the surface tension . in good approximation ,",
    "an interface of 001-orientation ( or symmetrically equivalent ) is just a flat interface between two pure states , with a free energy of @xmath4 ( one broken bond ) per unit area .",
    "similarly , by counting broken bonds , one finds that an interface of @xmath28-orientation ( here @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not necessarily integers ) has an energy per unit area of @xmath31 . for non - zero temperature",
    "there is an additional contribution from the entropy of the steps required to form such an interface . for not too large values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 this may be obtained by multiplying the step density needed to create a surface of orientation @xmath28 with the meandering entropy of such a step .",
    "the resulting expression is .",
    "@xmath32 } { \\sqrt{1+k^2+l^2}}.\\ ] ] this result is independent of the value of @xmath0 , especially it also holds for the ising model .",
    "excitations creating spins not belonging to the two phases that coexist at the interface are so rare that they may be neglected completely . for @xmath33 or @xmath34 the entropy becomes dominated by thermal step fluctuations , but this concerns an extremely small range of orientations only ( however , it does set the distance between facet edges ) .",
    "blte and hilhorst  @xcite give expressions for the free energy from which the low temperature ecs may be obtained for all orientations .",
    "the unimportance of all but the two coexisting phases implies that for large @xmath0 the 001-facets do not roughen , as @xmath7 is well below the roughening temperature of these facets in the ising model ( see section  [ se : tr ] ) .",
    "the equilibrium shape then remains nearly cubic for all temperatures up to @xmath7 .",
    "roughening transitions of crystal surfaces are characterized by the disappearance of macroscopically flat regions , or facets , in the ecs .",
    "facets existing at low temperatures often disappear when the temperature increases , at a characteristic temperature known as the roughening temperature @xmath2 of the specific facet orientation . at this temperature",
    "the inverse radius of curvature @xmath35 of the crystal surface at the center of the facet jumps from zero ( when a facet is present ) to a non - zero value . using renormalization - group calculations , jayaprakash _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the size of this jump satisfies the universal relationship @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the distance from the tangent plane at the facet to the center of mass of the crystal , and @xmath38 is the surface tension of the 001-facet at @xmath39 .",
    "the latter is not known exactly for any of the @xmath0-state potts models in three dimensions .",
    "an approximation consisting of the ground state value plus the first correction term in a low temperature expansion is @xmath40 it will turn out that this approximation suffices for our goal : even for the smallest @xmath0-values the contribution of the correction term at @xmath39 is already smaller than the estimated systematic error in the curvature measurements .",
    "if the center of mass of the ecs is placed at the origin , the centers of the facets that are present below the roughening temperature are located on the principal axes . to estimate the location of the roughening transition",
    ", we first measure the curvature at the six points where the ecs ( obtained as in the previous section ) cuts a principal axis , in the two principal directions tangential to the surface .",
    "the curvature was obtained by fitting a quadratic function @xmath41 ; the fitted result for @xmath42 is the normalized inverse radius of curvature .",
    "since we use a non - zero fitting range , the slope of the curve can not become infinite and consequently we do not observe a jump in curvature ; in fact we find quite smooth dependence of curvature on temperature , as a result of finite size , round - off and fluctuation effects .",
    "however , we made sure that our procedure to estimate @xmath2 is not very sensitive to this .",
    "notably our estimate of the roughening temperature for the ising model is close to previous estimates : adler reported @xmath43  @xcite , mon et al .",
    "reported @xmath44  @xcite , and holzer and wortis reported @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the resulting measurements of the normalized inverse curvature are plotted in figure  [ curves ] .",
    "the error bars indicate the statistical error ; additional simulations for some points indicate that the systematic errors arising from the effects of thermalization , cluster shape deformations , long lived thermal excitations , etc . , are larger . in the same plot , the curves described by eq .",
    "( [ rc ] ) are also plotted .",
    "the intersection points of these two curves are estimates of the location of the roughening transition .",
    "the resulting values for the roughening temperature can be found in table  [ tatr ] ; the error indications are our estimates of the statistical and systematic errors combined .    in the previous section we noted that for large @xmath0 there is no roughening transition .",
    "obviously @xmath46 is not large enough to observe this , but the increase of @xmath47 is very clear",
    ". it would be interesting to know the largest @xmath0-value for which a stable roughening transition does exist .",
    "the values of @xmath48 quoted in table  [ tatr ] combined with the estimate of @xmath7 of eq .",
    "( [ betaqlarge ] ) suggest a value between 20 and 40 . with the present method",
    "this would make simulations very slow , and it would also require an accurate measurement of the melting temperatures , since no literature values exist .    * roughening temperatures , @xmath0-state potts - model *    .[tatr ] inverse transition temperature , ratio of the roughening and transition temperatures and inverse roughening temperature of the @xmath0-states potts model .",
    "the references in the first column point to the sources we used for the data on the transition temperatures . for comparison we added the critical interaction parameter @xmath49 for the two dimensional potts model in the last column . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in general , the surface tension @xmath50 can be written as @xmath51 , where @xmath38 is the surface tension of an interface oriented in the @xmath52 , or symmetrically equivalent direction@xcite . in experiments with pb crystals in equilibrium with their vapor ,",
    "heyraud and mtois used the inverse wulff construction ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) to obtain the angular part of the surface tension @xmath53 as a function of orientation @xmath54 and the same method has been employed by surnev et al .",
    "here we use it to obtain the orientation dependence of the surface tension for each ecs as obtained in section [ se : ecs ] .",
    "the surface tension @xmath53 is proportional to the distance from the center of the cluster to the tangent plane perpendicular to @xmath54 , touching the iso - surface in the point @xmath55 . if the ecs is scaled such that the distance to the surface from the center of the shape along the lattice axes is unity ,",
    "then @xmath56 where @xmath55 is an element of the scaled iso - surface @xmath57 .",
    "thus , for every direction @xmath54 , we have to find the point @xmath55 in the iso - surface , for which the number @xmath58 is maximal .",
    "this procedure works in both two and three dimensions .    using ecs s obtained from fully symmetrized density profiles , we measured @xmath53 along the arc in the @xmath59-zone , which connects the @xmath52 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 directions",
    ". figure  [ wulff ] shows the results .",
    "7.5 cm 7.5 cm 7.5 cm 7.5 cm    these figures show that the angular dependence of the surface tension becomes nearly constant at increasing temperature , for all numbers of states @xmath0 considered here .",
    "thus , for @xmath62 the ecs approaches a sphere .",
    "for the ising model ( @xmath1 ) this was to be expected , since this model undergoes a continuous phase transition at the melting point .",
    "on the other hand , it is also clear that aspheric deviations become larger with increasing @xmath0 . as we saw in section  [ se : largeq ] the ecs becomes nearly cubic for large @xmath0 .",
    "obviously @xmath46 still should be considered a small @xmath0-value in this context .",
    "if the ecs is not faceted , the angular part of the surface tension will approach the point @xmath63 with zero slope .",
    "if however the ecs has @xmath52 facets , the approach to the point @xmath63 will occur with a non - zero slope , resulting in a cusp in the slope along the arc through this point  @xcite .",
    "looking for the temperature where these cusps first appear is an alternative way to measure the roughening temperature .",
    "we found this to be less accurate than the procedure described in section [ se : tr ] .",
    "the results were however consistent .",
    "we studied the potts model with @xmath1 , 3 , 4 , and 6 states , forced into coexistence by fixing the density of one state .",
    "the resulting ecs was studied as a function of temperature and number of states .",
    "we found that the roughening transition , which is well known for the ising model ( equivalent to the two - states potts model ) , persists for higher numbers of states , at least up to six states .",
    "the temperature @xmath2 at which this roughening transition occurs , measured as a fraction of the melting temperature , tends to increase with increasing number of states .    in the future , we want to study the more general and richer behavior of the ecs in case more than one quantity is conserved .",
    "for instance , in the three - state potts model close to its melting point , with the constraint @xmath64 , the ecs resembles the shape of two soap bubbles with a common interface ; this changes under variations of temperature and the ratio @xmath65 .",
