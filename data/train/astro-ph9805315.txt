    "twenty years ago denoyer ( 1979a , b ) found clear evidence for the interaction of the supernova remnant ic 443 with molecular gas , based on observations of disturbed co emission .",
    "ic 443 has become an especially rich target for molecular line observations , including h@xmath13 ( burton et al .",
    "1988 ; richter et al .",
    "1995b ) ; co and hco@xmath14 ( dickman et al . 1992",

    "; van dishoeck et al . 1993 ) .",
    "weaker evidence for interaction was found in co observations of w44 and w28 ( wootten 1977 , 1981 ) , which were earlier found to be sources of oh 1720 mhz line emission ( goss & robinson 1968 ) .",
    "oh 1720 mhz maser line emission has emerged as a signpost of molecular interaction with the detection of compact oh emission from 8 supernova remnants ( frail et al .",
    "1996 ) , including w44 , ic 443 , and 3c391 .",
    "these remnants typically have a radius @xmath15 pc .",
    "the interaction of supernova remnants with molecular clouds can plausibly occur because massive stars are born in such clouds and have a relatively short lifetime .",
    "stars with initial mass @xmath0 are expected to end their lives as core collapse supernovae .",
    "previous theoretical treatments of the interaction problem have concentrated on the interaction with very dense cloud material .",
    "shull ( 1980 ) considered an ambient medium with density @xmath16 @xmath4 and predicted strong ir ( infrared ) emission that decayed after 20 years .",
    "wheeler , mazurek , & sivaramakrishnan ( 1980 ) found that evolution in a medium with @xmath17 @xmath4 leads to a high ir luminosity for @xmath18 years , followed by a rapid drop .",
    "the remnant radius is @xmath19 pc during its bright phase",
    ". events of this kind have not been identified , but it is not clear what limits can be set from existing ir observations .",
    "the existing observations of remnant / cloud interactions require a different model .",
    "the model i explore here is the interaction of a remnant with a clumpy molecular cloud .",
    "observations of molecular clouds have shown them to be clumpy , with a filling factor for the dense molecular clumps of @xmath20 ( blitz 1993 ) .",
    "the interclump gas has a density of @xmath21 @xmath4 .",
    "a supernova is more likely to explode in the interclump gas than in a dense clump , especially when the effects of presupernova winds and photoionization and stellar motion are taken into account . in ",
    "2 , i consider the likely environment for a supernova in a molecular cloud , including the effects of presupernova winds and photoionization as well as the structure of the molecular cloud .",
    "the remnant expansion in a molecular cloud is treated in   3 , on the assumption that the evolution in the interclump region can be separated from the interaction with clumps .",
    "in   4 , i compare this model to observations of three well - observed remnants : w44 , ic 443 , and 3c391 .",
    "the model does appear to be compatible with the basic observations .",
    "nonthermal particles and their emission are treated in   5 .",
    "this topic is of special interest in view of the probable detection of supernova remnants in molecular clouds with the _ egret _ experiment on the _ cgro _ ( _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ) ( esposito et al .",
    "possible future work is briefly discussed in   6 .",
    "observational studies of molecular clouds have shown them to have dense molecular clumps embedded in a lower density interclump medium ( blitz 1993 ) .",
    "a good example is the study of the rosette cloud by williams , blitz , & stark ( 1995 ) , who show that the clumps have a density of 440 h atoms @xmath4 and a filling factor of 0.08 .",
    "the interclump medium has a density of 11 h atoms @xmath4 , so that the clumps comprise 3.5 times more mass than the interclump medium , but occupy a small fraction of the volume .",
    "the distribution of clump masses , @xmath22 , in clouds can be described by a power law , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of clouds with mass between @xmath22 and @xmath25 .",
    "the relevant mass range is @xmath26 , which corresponds to diameters of @xmath27 pc if clumps have a typical h@xmath13 density of @xmath28 @xmath4 .",
    "more generally , blitz ( 1993 ) notes some properties of typical gmc s ( giant molecular clouds ) : total mass @xmath29 , diameter @xmath30 pc , h@xmath13 density in clumps of @xmath28 @xmath4 , interclump gas density in the range @xmath21 h atoms @xmath4 , and clump filling factor of @xmath31 % .",
    "the clump mass spectrum can be described by @xmath32 with @xmath33 in the range @xmath34 .",
    "more recently , kramer et al . (",
    "1998 ) have also found power law distributions of clump mass with @xmath35 in 7 clouds ; the clump masses range from @xmath36 . with this mass spectrum ,",
    "most of the clouds are small , but most of the mass is in large clumps .",
    "the lower limit to the clump masses is set by observational constaints .",
    "blitz ( 1993 ) noted that the clump shapes vary from spherical to highly irregular .    an interclump pressure , @xmath37 k @xmath4 , is needed to confine the dense clumps and to support the cloud against gravitational collapse ( blitz 1993 ) .",
    "the thermal pressure in the interclump gas is clearly too small and magnetic fields are a plausible pressure source .",
    "studies of the polarization of the light from stars behind molecular clouds implies that the interclump magnetic field does have a relatively smooth structure ( heiles et al .",
    "1993 ) . setting @xmath38 equal to the above pressure yields @xmath39 g , where @xmath40 is the uniform field component and @xmath41 is @xmath42 in units of @xmath43 k @xmath4 .",
    "however , a uniform magnetic field would not provide support along the magnetic field and would not explain the large line widths observed in clouds .",
    "an analysis of the polarization and zeeman effect in the dark cloud l204 shows consistency with equal contributions to the pressure from a uniform field and a fluctuating , nonuniform component ( myers & goodman 1991 ; heiles et al .",
    "the uniform component is then @xmath44 g .",
    "the magnetic field strength deduced in l204 is consistent with this value .",
    "the molecular cloud can be influenced by stellar mass loss and photoionization by the progenitor star before the supernova .",
    "the effect of these processes can be to remove molecular gas from the vicinity of the central star . from the point of view of interpreting the observations of supernova remnants mentioned in ",
    "1 , it is important whether molecular clumps can survive within @xmath11 pc of the central star .",
    "mckee , van buren , & lazareff ( 1984 ) found that b0o4 stars could clear a region 28 pc in radius of clumps if the mean density was @xmath45 @xmath4 .",
    "small clumps are completely photoevaporated and large clumps move out by the `` rocket '' effect . if the scaling for the radius @xmath46 ( mckee et al . 1984 )",
    "can be extrapolated to the somewhat higher mean densities of interest here , a region @xmath47 pc is expected to become free of molecular clumps .",
    "the photoevaporation of clumps has been studied in greater detail by bertoldi & mckee ( 1990 ) , who found that the rocket effect is smaller than that in previous investigations . however , the rocket velocity @xmath48 is still sufficient to clear a region @xmath47 pc in size .",
    "the additional effect of stellar winds is to clear a wind bubble in the homogenized region for the stronger winds or to create a wind bubble within the hii region ( mckee et al .",
    "1984 ) .",
    "the situation changes for early b type stars , which have weaker photoionizing fluxes and stellar winds .",
    "these stars have sufficiently long lifetimes that their hii regions can come into pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium .",
    "i assume that the surrounding interclump medium exerts a pressure @xmath49 k @xmath4 and that the gas temperature in the hii region is @xmath50 k , so that the density in the ionized gas is @xmath51 h atoms @xmath4 . for the ionizing",
    "fluxes given in panagia ( 1973 ) , table 1 shows the radii of the ionized regions , @xmath52 , for o9b3 main sequence stars .",
    "the small sizes of the ionized regions for b1b3 stars is evident .",
    "the radii for the regions around the o9 and b0 stars appears to be smaller than those obtained by mckee et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ; this is presumably because of the higher surrounding pressure taken here .",
    "stellar winds are an additional effect on the circumstellar environment . the maximum size",
    ", @xmath53 , of the wind bubble is that at which the bubble comes into pressure equilibrium with its surroundings , or the wind energy production is about equal to the displaced energy : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the wind mass loss rate and velocity and @xmath57 is the main sequence age . for typical parameters ,",
    "the result for @xmath53 is @xmath58 the values of @xmath55 in table 1 are from de jager , nieuwenhuijzen , & van der hucht ( 1988 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath57 are estimated from the evolutionary tracks of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for a somewhat different set of stellar masses .",
    "i have taken @xmath59 , as appropriate for these stellar types , and @xmath60 k @xmath4 in order to obtain the values of @xmath53 shown in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the wind bubble is somewhat larger than the ionized region , although b1b3 stars do have bubble sizes that are smaller than those of the remnants of interest .",
    "mckee et al .",
    "( 1984 ) note that if the wind bubble begins to expand beyond the ionized region , matter will be photoevaporated from clumps and may mix with the hot gas inside the bubble .",
    "the higher density gas can have a cooling time that is shorter than the age , so that the assumption of energy conservation of the bubble gas made in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is not valid , and the bubble radius may be limited to a value close to that of the ionized region .    in the later stages of evolution , the star becomes a red supergiant and has a slow dense wind which can cool after passing through a termination shock . equating the wind ram pressure ( @xmath61 ) with the interclump pressure , @xmath60 k @xmath4 , yields an",
    "approximate stopping radius of @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the wind mass loss rate in units of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the wind velocity in units of @xmath66 .",
    "even if the immediate progenitor star does not modify its environment , it is quite possible that more massive stars form in association with the progenitor and that these stars affect the environment .",
    "the @xmath2 stars explode relatively late so that more massive companions do have an opportunity to change the environment . however , the lower mass molecular clouds ( mass @xmath67 ) can have one or no o stars ( williams & mckee 1997 ) .",
    "this discussion leads to the conclusion supernova remnants with radii @xmath15 pc can involve interaction with a quiescent molecular cloud , although they are a fraction of the type ii supernovae .",
    "the examination of remnants where cloud interaction appears to be taking place will then indicate whether this is occurring , or whether modification of the supernova surroundings by the progenitor star and its companions needs to be taken into account .",
    "a reference interclump density is @xmath68 h atoms @xmath4 .",
    "i assume that as a first approximation , the presence of the dense clumps can be neglected in the propagation of the supernova shock front .",
    "the evolution of a supernova remnant in a uniform medium has been frequently treated , so i primarily highlight some of the aspects that are important for the molecular cloud case .    in the first phase of evolution ,",
    "the supernova ejecta are decelerated by interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "the ejecta are expected to be mostly freely expanding until they have swept up their own mass , which occurs at a radius @xmath69 pc , where @xmath70 is the ejected mass in units of @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the interclump h density in units of 10 h atoms @xmath4 .",
    "this radius is sufficiently small that the effects of the progenitor star on its surroundings are likely to be important for this initial phase of evolution .",
    "however , once the shock front has propagated several pc , the flow in the interclump medium should tend toward the sedov blast wave solution .",
    "the remnant next enters a radiative phase ( cox 1972 ; chevalier 1974 ; cioffi , mckee , & bertschinger 1988 ) . for gas with solar metallicity ,",
    "cioffi et al . (",
    "1988 ) find that the time taken to cool to 0 temperature , i.e. shell formation , is @xmath73 years , where @xmath74 is the supernova energy in units of @xmath75 ergs .",
    "the effects of radiative losses actually become important at an earlier time and cioffi et al .",
    "suggest that the pressure - driven snowplow ( pds ) phase begins at at @xmath76 years , where @xmath77 is the base of the natural logarithm .",
    "the corresponding shock radius and velocity are @xmath78 pc and @xmath79 . for the further evolution of the remnant radius , cioffi et al .",
    "( 1988 ) advocate an offset power law in time .",
    "however , over the range of @xmath80 the value of @xmath81 is in the range @xmath82 so that a power law in time is an adequate representation .    for @xmath49 @xmath4 k and @xmath68 @xmath4 ,",
    "the isothermal sound speed in the cloud is @xmath83 . for @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ", the shock velocity drops to twice the isothermal sound speed at a radius of 25 pc .",
    "because the typical diameter of a cloud is 45 pc ( blitz 1993 ) , the remnant is more likely to break out of the cloud before it merges with the cloud .",
    "the expansion of the radiative shell can be treated independently of the shell structure , which depends on the radiative cooling and on contributions to the pressure .",
    "this is true provided that the shell thickness is small compared to its radius ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "bertschinger ( 1986 ) developed an analytical solution for the shell structure on the assumption of radiative cooling to a particular temperature and adiabatic evolution after that point ; magnetic effects were neglected .",
    "cioffi et al .",
    "( 1988 ) made the same assumption in their numerical calculations , allowing radiative cooling to @xmath87 k. on the other hand , chevalier ( 1974 ) and slavin & cox ( 1992 ) performed numerical calculations with magnetic support in the dense shell .",
    "the observations of molecular clouds point to the presence of a significant uniform magnetic field .",
    "i take the case of expansion in a uniform magnetic field and start with the expansion perpendicular to the magnetic field direction .",
    "if a uniform magnetic field gives a pressure of @xmath49 @xmath4 k , the field strength is @xmath88 g. the field is likely to have a significant nonuniform component , but a tangential field component @xmath89 g is plausible .",
    "the density at the point where the magnetic pressure becomes important can be expressed as @xmath90 @xmath4 , where @xmath91 is the shock velocity in units of 100 @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the ambient tangential field in units of @xmath94 g ( e.g. , draine & mckee 1993 ) .",
    "the immediate postshock temperature is @xmath95 k if the gas is fully ionized , so that the tangential field comes to dominate the pressure provided that the temperature drops below @xmath96 k ; the radiative cooling is certainly likely to take the temperature below this value and the cooling becomes more isochoric than isobaric as in the case of a lower magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field strength after the compression is @xmath97 g and the alfven velocity is substantial , @xmath98 .",
    "if we consider a ring of radius @xmath99 and thickness @xmath100 perpendicular to the field direction , flux conservation implies that the quantity @xmath101 is conserved .",
    "mass conservation implies @xmath102 is conserved , for spherical expansion .",
    "the result is @xmath103 .",
    "this is an approximation because the expansion is not exactly spherical .",
    "the method of bertschinger ( 1986 ) for the shell structure can be extended to the magnetic case of interest here .",
    "the equations of mass and momentum conservation for spherical flow are @xmath104 where @xmath105 and the magnetic pressure is taken to dominate in the dense shell .",
    "flux conservation can be written as @xmath106    i assume that the outer shock has a radius @xmath107 , so that the shock velocity is @xmath108 .",
    "as in bertschinger ( 1986 ) , the compression in the radiative , thermal pressure - dominated region is described by a parameter @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the ambient density and @xmath111 is the density at the base of the radiative region . for a case with no magnetic field and an isothermal shock front ( as in bertschinger 1986 ) , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the shock mach number . in the present case ,",
    "the compression is limited by the magnetic field and @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the alfven mach number .",

    "1 ) during the time that the shell thickness is small compared to the radius .",

    "2 .      the supernova remnant becomes radiative in the interclump medium at a relatively small radius ( @xmath51 pc ) and interaction of the cool shell with a molecular clump becomes a matter of interest .",
    "this is the phase of evolution that is most likely to be observed because it lasts longer than the early adiabatic phase , and the observations of remnants discussed in the next section imply that the remnants under consideration are in the radiative phase . in the initial interaction ,",
    "the radiative shell drives a dense slab into the clump , as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . here , i approximate the motion of the slab as one - dimensional . the slab is bounded by shock waves in the clump and in the radiative shell .",
    "the equations describing the evolution of the position @xmath146 , surface density @xmath147 , and velocity @xmath148 of the slab are @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the density and velocity in the radiative shell . provided the thickness of the radiative shell is sufficiently small , @xmath153 can be regarded as constant ( see   3.2 ) .",

    "a recent development has been the likely detection of a number of supernova remnants in energetic @xmath12-rays , including w44 , ic 443 , and w28 ( esposito et al .",
    "possible sources of the emission are bremsstrahlung and inverse compton radiation associated with energetic electrons and pion decays associated with energetic protons .",
    "these emission mechanisms have been extensively studied in the context of the supernova remnant emission ( de jager & mastichiadis 1997 ; sturner et al .",
    "1997 ; gaisser , protheroe , & stanev 1998 ) .",
    "although these studies have treated the emission mechanisms in detail , their treatments of the supernova remnant structure are more rudimentary .",
    "for example , sturner et al . (",
    "1997 ) present a model for ic 443 in which the interior density is constant at 4 times the ambient density of 10 @xmath4 and the magnetic field is constant at 4 times the ambient value of 5 @xmath9 g .",
    "they assume that particle acceleration terminates when a remnant enters the radiative phase , but have ic 443 as non - radiative at an age of 5,000 yrs . here , i examine the nonthermal component in the context of the supernova remnant models developed in the previous section .",
    "the nonthermal component is observed at the highest spatial resolution at radio wavelengths .",
    "a close correlation between the radio and optical structure has been found in ic 443 ( duin & van der laan 1975 ) and in w44 ( giacani et al .",
    "the optical structure in ic 443 and other radiative shock front regions is best explained as emission from a wavy sheet .",
    "the fact that the radio emission shows a similar structure implies that a major part of it is associated with a thin region near the radiative shock .",
    "duin & van der laan ( 1975 ) attribute the emission to the compressed ambient magnetic field and cosmic ray electrons .",
    "particle acceleration at the shock front can also be a factor ( e.g. , blandford & cowie 1982 ) .",
    "radiative shock fronts are also driven into the dense clump gas and the high pressure should result in a high magnetic field strength in the postshock region (   3.3 ) . however , the clumps do not appear to be significantly enhanced sources of radio synchrotron emission .",
    "figures 2 and 3 of claussen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that except for the sources",
    "oh d and oh e in w44 , there is little correlation between the compact oh masers and the radio continuum emission in w44 and ic 443 . in ic 443 , the small region of oh masers",
    "does match up with a co clump ( claussen et al .",
    "1997 ) , but the radio continuum emission shows little correlation with the co clumps ( dickman et al .",
    "the absence of strong emission is not surprising because the shock fronts into the clumps are not ionizing shock fronts . under these circumstances ,",
    "alfven waves are damped in the neutral gas and energetic particles may be able to escape from the shock region .",
    "the conclusion is that the radio emission is from the compressed regions behind the radiative shock fronts in the interclump gas .",
    "a possible problem with this source is free - free absorption by compressed gas in the cooling , recombining region .",
    "erickson & mahoney ( 1985 ) have pointed out the lack of free - free absorption in ic 443 down to @xmath304 mhz , which may be a problem in a radiative shock model . at @xmath305 mhz",
    ", absorption does appear to be present .",
    "i estimate the free - free optical depth from the intensity of @xmath306 emission expected from a radiative shock front . taking the @xmath306 intensity from raymond s ( 1979 ) shock models for a @xmath10 shock and the @xmath306 emissivity coefficient from osterbrock ( 1989 ) , i find the free - free depth at @xmath307 k to be @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the frequency in units of @xmath310 hz . for ic 443 ,",
    "the cooling region is just becoming optically thick at @xmath252 mhz , which is roughly compatible with the observations .",
    "the h@xmath227 intensity observed by fesen & kirshner ( 1980 ) is higher than that in the shock model by @xmath311 10 in some bright filaments , which can be attributed to the fact that bright filaments are probably shock fronts viewed edge - on .",
    "the observed radio flux from ic 443 , @xmath312 jy at 1 ghz ( erickson & mahoney 1985 ) , can be used to find the energy density of the relativistic electrons in the context of the radiative shell model .",
    "the emitting volume of the thin shell is @xmath313 , where @xmath314 . with @xmath259 pc ,",
    "the emitting volume is @xmath315 @xmath316 .",
    "i take @xmath317 g in the thin shell , so that the emitting electrons at 1 ghz have energies @xmath318 gev .",
    "the radio spectral index is observed to be @xmath319 ( erickson & mahoney 1985 ) , where @xmath8 is defined by flux @xmath273 ; this corresponds to an energy spectral index @xmath320 ( @xmath321 ) .",
    "the basic parameters given here for the radiative shell of ic 443 are close to those given by duin & van der laan ( 1975 ) , and the radio flux can again be attributed to the compression and acceleration of ambient cosmic ray electrons in the dense shell .",
    "blandford & cowie ( 1982 ) discussed particle acceleration in older remnants with radiative shock waves , like ic 443 .",
    "they noted that very efficient cosmic ray acceleration at the shock front can not be occurring , or the high compression in the radiative region of the shock front could not take place .",
    "however , in their model the ambient cosmic ray electrons are accelerated in the shock front by the first - order fermi mechanism , which produces a @xmath322 energy spectrum .",
    "this is significantly steeper than the spectral index observed in ic 443 .",
    "if the emitting electrons are compressed ambient cosmic rays , the spectral index may depend on that of the ambient cosmic rays . as a first approximation",
    ", i take the cosmic ray spectrum in the cloud to be the same as that in the galaxy .",
    "observations of molecular clouds with _ cgro _ indicate that the cosmic ray content of molecular clouds is similar to that in the rest of the interstellar medium ( digel et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "taking into account the compression in the radiative shock front , the initial preshock electron energy range covered by the 30 mhz  10 ghz observations of ic 443 is 50  900 mev .",
    "longair ( 1994 , p. 284 ) estimates @xmath323 over the energy range 10100 mev and @xmath324 over 100 mev  1 gev for ambient , interstellar cosmic ray electrons .    for shock acceleration in the test particle limit ( blandford & ostriker 1978 ) , an input spectrum with @xmath325 results in @xmath322 in the postshock region .",
    "if @xmath326 initially , the particle spectrum is preserved in the postshock region .",
    "the relatively flat ambient cosmic ray spectrum is thus preserved in the postshock region and can explain the flat radio synchrotron spectrum that is observed in ic 443 .",
    "this spectrum would be difficult to understand if electrons were injected at the shock front .",
    "longair ( 1994 ) attributes the flat spectrum of the ambient cosmic rays to coulomb losses in the interstellar medium , which he estimates as @xmath327 ev yr@xmath222 where @xmath328 in the gas density in @xmath4 .",
    "coulomb losses in the dense shell of the supernova remnant are also possible . for particle energy @xmath329 mev and @xmath330 @xmath4 ,",
    "the loss time is @xmath331 yr .",
    "this is longer than the estimated age of the remnant ( @xmath332 yr ) , but is suffiently close that coulomb losses in the shell could be a factor for some remnants .",
    "the electron particle spectrum required to produce the observed flux from ic 443 , given the above spectrum and volume , is @xmath333 in cgs units .",
    "on the assumption that the particle pitch angles are isotropized during the postshock compression , the individual particles gain energy as @xmath334 , where @xmath335 is the compression factor , and @xmath336 . from the theory of blandford & ostriker ( 1978 )",
    ", the shock acceleration of the ambient cosmic rays leads to an increase in @xmath337 by a factor of 14 .",
    "the combination of these factors implies that the electron spectrum ahead of the shock front is @xmath338 .",
    "this spectrum compares adequately with the spectrum @xmath339 given by longair ( 1994 ) for ambient cosmic ray electrons up to @xmath18 mev ; at 100 mev , the required spectral density is 3 times that provided by the ambient cosmic rays . in the present model ,",
    "the electron energy density in the dense shell is @xmath19 % of the magnetic energy density .",
    "i have neglected the structure of the radiative shell , but this should not significantly affect the results .",
    "the present model for the radio emission resembles that of blandford & cowie ( 1982 ) except for the difference in spectral index and in the overall picture .",
    "blandford & cowie take the emission to be from crushed interstellar clouds , whereas here it is from the radiative shell in the interclump medium of a molecular cloud",
    ".    further support for the molecular cloud model comes from polarization observations of the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "kundu & velusamy ( 1972 ) found that both ic 443 and w44 show an ordered field direction and that the polarization in w44 is up to 20% , which is unusually high for a supernova remnant .",
    "in the case of ic 443 , the magnetic field direction deduced from the synchrotron emission lines up with that deduced from interstellar polarization in the surrounding cloud .",
    "the emission is thus consistent with the compressed magnetic field coming from the interclump component of a molecular cloud with a significant uniform magnetic field ( see   2 ) .",
    "the relativistic electrons that give rise to synchrotron radiation can also give rise to bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the bremsstrahlung intensity for a power law electron spectrum is @xmath340 @xmath4 ergs@xmath222 s@xmath222 ( longair 1994 , p. 269 ) .",
    "if electrons of an energy @xmath341 can be considered to give synchrotron radiation at a frequency @xmath342 and bremsstrahlung radiation at energy @xmath341 , then the ratio of bremsstrahlung power to synchrotron power for those electrons is @xmath343 where the bremsstrahlung emission is at photon energy @xmath341 , the radio synchrotron emission is at frequency @xmath342 , and @xmath322 has been assumed .",
    "a similar calculation for @xmath320 gives @xmath344 for the ratio when the reference values are used .",
    "the critical frequency for synchrotron emission from an electron of energy @xmath341 is @xmath345 so for ic 443 , an electron radiating at 1 ghz has @xmath346 gev .",
    "the reference values for ic 443 , used in eq .",
    "( 33 ) , then give the ratio of @xmath12-ray power ( at 0.56 gev ) to radio synchrotron power ( at 1 ghz ) for the remnant . the observed value for the ratio is about 30 ( esposito et al . 1996",
    "; see fig .",
    "11 of sturner et al .",
    "the current model thus gives the correct ratio to order of magnitude , although the model ratio does fall short of the observed ratio .",
    "one possibility is that there is a contribution to the bremsstrahlung emission from the shocked molecular clump material ; the high density in this gas ( @xmath347 @xmath4 ) favors bremsstrahlung emission over synchrotron emission .",
    "sturner et al . (",
    "1997 ) also propose a bremsstrahlung model for the high energy @xmath12-ray emission from ic 443 , but in the context of a different supernova remnant model ( uniform @xmath348 @xmath4 and @xmath349 g inside the remnant ) .",
    "other possibilities for the high energy @xmath12-ray emission are inverse compton emission and pion decays triggered by the collisions of relativistic protons with thermal gas .",
    "the importance of inverse compton compared to bremsstrahlung depends on the ratio of the radiation energy density to the gas density .",
    "gaisser et al . (",
    "1998 ) have discussed the radiation energy density in ic 443 . for @xmath330 @xmath4 taken here , the inverse compton mechanism is not a factor .",
    "the spectrum expected for pion decay @xmath12-ray emission does not fit the observed @xmath12-ray spectrum ( esposito et al .",
    "1996 ; sturner et al . 1997 ; gaisser et al .",
    "1998 ) so that bremsstrahlung emission must be a significant contributor to the emission in the present model .",
    "pion decay emission may still make a contribution to the @xmath12-rays , but a detailed calculation of the emission is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the present model does give a definite scenario ( acceleration and compression of ambient cosmic rays ) that can be examined .",
    "the nonthermal emission from the other supernova remnants can be investigated from the same point of view .",
    "the radio spectral index of w44 is @xmath350 ( kovalenko , pynzar , & udaltsov 1994 ) , which can again be explained in the present model by the acceleration and compression of ambient cosmic ray electrons .",
    "because of the flat spectral index , de jager & mastichiadis ( 1997 ) suggest a model in which the electrons come from the pulsar associated with the remnant .",
    "the ability of the electrons to move into a shell with a tangential magnetic field is not clear . in the case of 3c391 , the spectral index is steeper , @xmath351 ( goss et al .",
    "one possibility is that this remnant has recently made the transition to being radiative in the interclump medium and there is an important contribution to the relativistic electrons from particles that have been injected into the shock acceleration process during the earlier phase .",
    "the main point here is not to present definitive models for the remnants , but to give a supernova remnant model that can be used in more detailed treatments of the various types of emission .",
    "the approximate results appear promising for more detailed calculations .",
    "the aim of this paper has been to show that observations of a number of luminous supernova remnants can be interpreted in terms of interaction with a clumpy molecular cloud .",
    "the remnants become radiative in the interclump medium and the radiative shells then interact with molecular clumps .",
    "the magnetically supported radiative shells can be observed as cool hi shells and by the radiative shock emission .",
    "because the extinction is frequently high to these remnants in dense regions , the study of infrared line emission can be especially fruitful .",
    "the [ oi ] 63@xmath9 m line has already been found to be a powerful probe of these remnants .",
    "a prediction of this model is that the high - energy @xmath12-ray emission detected from some of these remnants is from the radiative shell .",
    "this prediction can eventually be checked with experiments that have a higher spatial resolution than is currently possible , such as _ glast _ ( _ gamma - ray large area space telescope _ ) .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the expected emission spectrum for acceleration of ambient cosmic ray should also be carried out .",
    "the interaction of the radiative shell with molecular clumps can give a number of features observed from these remnants , such as higher pressures than those in the radiative shell and the acceleration of molecules to relatively high velocities .",
    "observations of molecular clouds have shown a great deal of small scale structure in the molecular material and this can be seen directly in h@xmath13 observations of the remnant ic 443 ( richter et al .",
    "there may also be instabilities associated with the interaction .",
    "numerical computations of the interaction of a radiative shell with a dense clump should be carried out to elucidate the hydrodynamic features of the interaction .",
    "these calculations will be helpful in the interpretation of detailed molecular shock wave observations .",
    "the hot interiors of the remnants are a source of x - ray emission .",
    "the observations show that the emission is close to isothermal , which suggests the action of heat conduction .",
    "however the evaporation of clumps does not appear to be a dominant process because of the small x - ray emitting mass and the fact that the radiative shells appear to be at the outer edges of the remnants .",
    "evolutionary calculations that include heat conduction are needed for a detailed comparison with these remnants .",
    "after this paper was submitted , the paper by shelton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) on a detailed model for w44 became available .",
    "shelton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) present a model that is similar to the one presented here in that w44 is found to be a radiative remnant in a medium with density @xmath5 @xmath4 , the synchrotron emission is from compressed ambient cosmic ray electrons ( although they do not include shock acceleration of these electrons ) , and the [ oi ] and h@xmath8 emission are from the radiative shock front .",
    "they go beyond the present work in showing how expansion into a medium with a density gradient can provide a detailed fit to the hi observations ( koo & heiles 1995 ) and in calculating the x - ray emission for a hydrodynamic model with heat conduction .",
    "the model is significantly more successful in fitting the observed x - ray emission than the non - conduction model of harrus et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , although the x - ray emission is still not as centrally peaked as is observed .",
    "a difference with the present model is that the oh maser emission is attributed to emission from the radiative shock front and shelton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find no compelling evidence for interaction with a molecular cloud .",
    "the point of view taken here that the oh masers are associated with shock fronts in molecular clumps is supported by the recent observations of frail & mitchell ( 1998 ) who find that there are co emitting clumps that are associated with the oh maser emission in w44 .",
    "massive stars are expected to frequently have sufficient photoionizing radiation and winds to sweep out a region @xmath47 pc in size around the stars .",
    "it is only the massive stars at the low mass end ( @xmath352 ) that may interact directly with a molecular cloud .",
    "although these are a minority of the remnants , they are bright because of the interaction with dense gas and so stand out in the observational sample .",
    "the further investigation of these objects can be expected to shed light on a number of physical processes , from molecular shock emission to the high - energy @xmath12-ray emission from cosmic rays .",
