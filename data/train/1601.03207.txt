    "[ 2 ] @xmath286  [ 3 ] : again [ 3 ] is equivalent to @xmath505 for each non - empty vertex induced subclutter @xmath119 of @xmath0 .",
    "as any vertex induced subclutter is obtained by consecutively deleting some vertices , we just need to show that if @xmath351 , then @xmath508 for a chordal clutter @xmath0 and vertex @xmath191 of @xmath0 .",
    "we prove this by induction on @xmath509 .",

    "let @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath510 , then @xmath511 . if @xmath512 , then @xmath513 and @xmath514 is a chordal clutter with a smaller number of circuits .",
    "hence the result follows from the induction hypothesis .",
    "it should be noted that if in [ ci and chordality][3 ] , we replace 3 with 2 or 1 , again the result clearly holds .",

    "but if we replace 2-cycle in [ 1 ] with 1-cycle or cf - cycle , then the obtained statement is not generally true .",
