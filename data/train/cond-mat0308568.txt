    "diluted magnetic semiconductors , such as ( ga , mn)as , are important materials combining ferromagnetic behavior with a sensitivity to doping characteristic for semiconductors .",
    "this leads to their interesting physical properties and makes possible their applications e.g. in spin - electronics @xcite .",
    "although ( ga , mn)as has been extensively studied in the last years , some aspects of the incorporation of mn into the crystal lattice still remain unclear .",
    "it was assumed that in the well defined samples mn simply substitutes for the host cation .",
    "only recently it was pointed out @xcite that the presence of interstitial mn may explain some peculiar properties of ( ga , mn)as such as the low doping efficiency of mn acceptors @xcite .",
    "the main reason for considering the mn atoms on the interstitial positions was that they act as double donors and partly compensate the mn acceptors in the substitutional positions .",
    "at the same time , channelling rutherford backscattering experiments proved that a large fraction of mn atoms indeed occupies the interstitial positions ( mn@xmath2 ) in the as - grown samples @xcite .",
    "a correlation between the removal of mn interstitials and increase of the conductivity , the curie temperature , and saturation magnetization has been found .",
    "in addition to the self - compensation effect , the interstitial mn atom also reduce the number of local moments that participate in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "this was explained by pairing of mn@xmath3 with the mn atoms in the substitutional positions ( mn@xmath4 ) due to their coulomb attraction @xcite . at the bonding distance , the antiferromagnetic superexchange within the pair",
    "is assumed to outweigh the hole mediated ferromagnetic exchange . as a result ,",
    "the moments of the paired mn atoms have opposite directions and the pair as a whole has no magnetic moment .",
    "the _ ab initio _ studies of the interstitial mn showed the differences in the electronic structure of the mn atom in the interstitial and substitutional positions @xcite and also a possible reaction path for the incorporation of mn into the gaas lattice @xcite .",
    "it was also found that the increase of the lattice constant of ga@xmath5mn@xmath6as with increasing content of mn is partly due to the presence of mn in the interstitial positions @xcite .",
    "recently , blinowski and kacman @xcite investigated the coupling of the local moment on the interstitial mn to the spin of the carriers in the valence band . using a simplified tight - binding model they showed that the local moment on mn atom in the tetrahedral position with four ga neighbors , t(ga@xmath0 ) , is effectively decoupled from the spin of the holes in the valence band .",
    "they claimed that the coupling is weak because , in addition to the reduced number of the holes , also the coupling constant @xmath1 is small for the interstitial mn in the t(ga@xmath0 ) position . as a result ,",
    "the local moment is not subject to the ferromagnetic coupling with the moments around it .",
    "this opens the way for the af exchange to be important in the mn@xmath2-mn@xmath7 pair , as anticipated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are , however , several open questions concerning the magnetic interactions of mn in the interstitial positions .",
    "first of all , the spin - polarized band structures @xcite did not show any indication of different values of @xmath1 for substitutional and interstitial mn , at least for the t(as@xmath0 ) positions . in addition , the mn@xmath2-mn@xmath7 pair as a whole is expected @xcite to have only a small magnetic moment , but the exchange coupling with mn@xmath7  being uncompensated by the contribution of mn@xmath2  should strongly polarize the holes .",
    "that is why we performed a more detailed study of the interstitial mn and its spin interactions .",
    "we use the density - functional , full - potential linearized augmented plane wave calculations ( fplapw @xcite ) to obtain the electronic structure of ( ga , mn)as with mn atoms in various crystallographic positions . the calculated total energies are used to compare different positions of the interstitial mn and to estimate the strength of the mn@xmath7-mn@xmath2 pair interactions .",
    "the splitting of the valence band for the majority- and minority - spin electrons is used to compare the corresponding values of the exchange parameters @xmath1 .",
    "we compare the total energies for three interstitial positions of mn in gaas .",
    "there are two inequivalent tetrahedral positions in the zinc - blende structure of gaas , t(as@xmath0 ) and t(ga@xmath0 ) .",
    "they are surrounded by four as and ga atoms , respectively .",
    "the ( unrelaxed ) distances of these nearest neighbors are equal to the length @xmath8 of the ga - as bond , i.e. to the mn - as distance for the substitutional mn@xmath7 .",
    "the local arrangement around the interstitial mn is , in contrast to mn@xmath7 , characterized by another six close neighbors at the distance @xmath9 . in the hexagonal position",
    ", the interstitial mn has three ga and three as atoms at the same distance @xmath10 , and no other close neighbors .",
    "we represent gaas with mn@xmath2 by hexagonal ga@xmath11as@xmath11mn supercells .",
    "the c - axis coincides with the body diagonal of the conventional cubic unit cell .",
    "the symmetry of the cell does not change if we shift the mn interstitial along the c - axis from t(as@xmath0 ) to hexagonal and t(ga@xmath0 ) positions .",
    "this makes possible to perform all calculations under the same conditions .",
    ".total energy , @xmath12 , and total spin , @xmath13 , of the unit cell of ga@xmath11as@xmath11mn with various interstitial positions of mn .",
    "ga@xmath14zn@xmath15as@xmath11mn samples are used to simulate p - type materials . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this effect is formally described by the kondo exchange interaction between the local spins @xmath16 at sites @xmath17 occupied by mn and the spin density @xmath18 due to the itinerant holes @xcite , @xmath19 the exchange parameter @xmath1 characterizes the strength of the coupling . within the mean - field theory , the kondo exchange interaction results in the splitting of the valence band edge @xmath20 .",
    "the splitting @xmath21 is proportional to the size @xmath22 of the local spins and to the concentration @xmath23 of magnetic ions , @xmath24 assuming spin @xmath25 for the holes , @xmath26 is the lattice constant .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ mfdev ] ) to determine the exchange parameter @xmath1 from our spin - polarized band structures .",
    "the results of the calculations for the unrelaxed geometries presented here and in ref .",
    "@xcite are summarized in table iii .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath1 are overestimated from the same reasons as discussed above in sect .",
    "being divided by a factor of two ( the reduction factor for the energy nominator ) , they approach the realistic values @xcite . in this work , however , we concentrate on the comparison of @xmath1 for different geometries .",
    "the overestimate of @xmath1 due to the reduced band gap is expected to be similar in all cases and not very important in this respect .        in fig .",
    "3 , we plot @xmath21 against @xmath23 to visualize the linear increase of the band splitting with the concentration of mn .",
    "the most noticeable result is that all points in fig .",
    "3 , obtained for substitutional mn as well for mn in the interstitial t(as@xmath0 ) and t(ga@xmath0 ) positions lie around the same line .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath1 does not depend much on the position of the mn atom in the lattice .",
    "this result is not very surprising in the case of the substitutional mn and t(as@xmath0 ) position . in either case ,",
    "mn is surrounded by four as atoms at the same distance @xmath8 and the same degree of the hybridization of the valence band states with mn d - states can be expected .    the results for the t(ga@xmath0 )",
    "position are not simple to interpret .",
    "the value of @xmath1 for both ga@xmath11mnas@xmath11 and ga@xmath27mnas@xmath27 is smaller than but comparable with the result for the substitutional mn@xmath7 site . assuming for simplicity that only the hybridization of the mn d - states with p - states of the nearest neighbors is relevant for the spin splitting @xmath21 , the values of @xmath1 simply reflect the orbital composition of the valence band .",
    "it is well known that the top of the valence band in gaas , as well as in other iii - v semiconductors , is composed of both anion and cation p - states , in the proportion approximately @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this means that the same proportion ( roughly 3:1 ) should be expected also for the exchange parameters @xmath1 parameters corresponding to mn atoms in substitutional and t(ga@xmath0 ) positions .",
    "the strong deviation of the actual density - functional results from this model expectation may indicate that the hybridization of the mn d - states with more distant neighbors has a remarkable influence on the magnetic interactions .",
    "the fact that the magnetic behavior of the interstitial mn is rather insensitive to its position in the crystal has two important implications concerning the mn@xmath7-mn@xmath2 pairs .",
    "first of all , the pair as a whole does not interact much with the spin of the holes because the effects due to mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath2 compensate one another . in this respect ,",
    "our _ ab initio _ results overcome the troubles of the simplified tight - binding models mentioned in the introduction .    in addition , the effective annihilation of mn@xmath7 due to pairing with mn@xmath2 is not restricted to the closest pairs with mn@xmath2 in the t(ga@xmath15mn ) position , but it works as long as the mn atoms are close one to another and the exchange coupling in the pair remains antiferromagnetic .",
    "we used the fplapw method to obtain total energies of supercells simulating various geometric and magnetic configurations of mn atoms in ( ga , mn)as . in absence of other defects ,",
    "the ground state of the mn interstitials is the tetrahedral t(as@xmath0 ) position .",
    "the energy of the t(ga@xmath0 ) position , however , is almost the same .",
    "the situation changes in the p - type material where the t(ga@xmath0 ) position has a lower energy .",
    "the hexagonal interstitial position has much higher energy and represents a barrier for diffusion of mn from one to another interstitial site .",
    "the barrier , and consequently also the mobility of the interstitial mn , depends on the doping .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath1 of mn interstitials with the holes in the valence band is , for both t(as@xmath0 ) and t(ga@xmath0 ) , close to the value of @xmath1 obtained for the substitutional mn .",
    "this is not consistent with the simplest tight - binding picture of mn d - states that hybridize only with the nearest neighbors . in this way ,",
    "our result indicate that the hybridization with more distant neighbors may be also important for the magnetic interactions .",
    "the mn interstitials are attracted to the substitutional mn and form stable and magnetically inactive pairs .",
    "the density - functional estimate for both binding energy of the pair and for the energy of the antiferromagnetic coupling is of order of 0.3 ev .",
    "this fits well with the present day notion of the interstitial mn in ( ga , mn)as .",
    "@xcite . in contrary to the general opinion , however , we found that the efficient pairing is not restricted to mn@xmath2 in the t(ga@xmath15mn ) position and we showed the importance of the close next - nearest neighbors for the properties of the interstitial mn .",
