    "characterizations of the critical behavior of model systems through experiments and simulations are essential to verify the validity of theoretical models of phase transitions .",
    "scattering techniques are invaluable for characterizing the staggered magnetization ( the order parameter ) , @xmath3 , the antiferromagnetic fluctuation correlation length , @xmath4 , and staggered susceptibility , @xmath5 , as a function of temperature in pure and dilute antiferromagnets , which prove to be ideal physical realizations of many model systems .",
    "neutron scattering has been particularly instrumental in studies of antiferromagnets@xcite , though magnetic x - ray scattering has also been employed to a limited extent@xcite . likewise ,",
    "pulsed heat and optical techniques@xcite have been essential in determining the critical behavior of the specific heat , @xmath6 .",
    "the ising model is the simplest of systems , with each spin having only two possible states , and becomes an exact model for the anisotropic antiferromagnets as the temperature @xmath7 approaches the transition temperature @xmath8 .",
    "three of the most fundamental phase transitions are the pure ising model , the random - exchange ising model ( reim ) and the random - field ising model ( rfim ) .",
    "the pure ising model has the exact onsager@xcite solution for dimension @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath10 only approximate renormalization solutions , simulations and expansions exist .",
    "antiferromagnets exist with strong anisotropy , such as @xmath11 for @xmath10 .",
    "this system exhibits universal ising static critical behavior close to the transition temperature@xcite .",
    "the random - exchange model system is realized when the magnetic ions are randomly substituted by diamagnetic ions in @xmath12 for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the percolation threshold for this body - centered tetragonal magnetic lattice if only the dominant next - nearest neighbor interaction@xcite is considered . below @xmath15",
    "no phase transition can occur for geometric connectivity reasons .",
    "the anisotropy increases as @xmath16 decreases@xcite . as a result of the high anisotropy for these systems measured using neutron scattering@xcite ,",
    "asymptotic ising critical behavior is well followed in the reduced temperature range @xmath17 , where @xmath8 is the transition temperature@xcite .",
    "various experimental techniques can be used to extract universal ising parameters associated with the asymptotic critical behaviors in antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "the universal parameters accessible through scattering techniques include the exponents and amplitude ratios associated with the asymptotic power law behaviors @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 refer to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is nonzero for @xmath22 only , @xmath25 and , for antiferromagnets with quenched randomness , the disconnected susceptibility @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "pulsed heat and optical techniques can be used to obtain the specific heat critical behavior , @xmath28 which becomes symmetric and logarithmic , @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "equations 1 - 6 represent the asymptotic behaviors exhibited for data with sufficiently small @xmath31 .",
    "the range of asymptotic ising behavior in anisotropic short - range interaction antiferromagnets , for example , is partly determined by the anisotropy strength .",
    "for example , whereas @xmath11 shows@xcite asymptotic behavior for @xmath32 , the less anisotropic isomorph @xmath33@xcite shows asymptotic behavior only for @xmath34 . if data are taken outside the asymptotic range of @xmath31 , but still within the critical region , fits to the power law expressions yield only effective exponents@xcite and effective amplitude ratios . in such cases , it may be more effective to use scaling function analyses , which include crossover to asymptotic critical behaviors , when some quantity such as the applied field , @xmath35 , can be varied .",
    "we will briefly discuss this with regard to specific heat analyses done principally using @xmath2 data .",
    "scaling functions are also of great utility in fitting scattering data when the line shapes are not well known . for example , at constant @xmath35 in the asymptotic region , we can use the fact that the scaling functions can depend only on @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the distance from the antiferromagnetic bragg scattering point , @xmath38 for @xmath11 , in reciprocal lattice units ( rlu ) and @xmath39 is the reciprocal correlation length for antiferromagnetic fluctuations . in this work , we will show how the general properties of the scaling functions can be utilized to advantage in the characterization of the random - exchange and random - field scattering data obtained@xcite using @xmath2 .",
    "however , the technique has more general utility ; it can be used in any case where theory does not provide adequate models of scattering functions but scaling is expected to hold .",
    "although we primarily focus here on the scaling behavior of the critical scattering of the @xmath10 dilute antiferromagnet , it is instructive to review briefly the success of scaling analyses in the study of the specific heat critical behavior in the same system . not only will this demonstrate the usefulness of the scaling approach , it will highlight the results for the specific heat behavior , which are complementary to the scattering results but show the largest discrepancy with simulation results for the rfim .",
    "this will be important in our later assessment of the agreement between simulations and experimental results .    in zero field ,",
    "the dilute anisotropic antiferromagnet is predicted to have a transition described by the random - exchange ising model .",
    "one of the most striking changes in the critical behavior induced by random quenched dilution is observed in the specific heat for @xmath10 . whereas the pure @xmath11 sample shows @xmath40 , in agreement with theory@xcite , the harris criterion imposes the constraint that @xmath41 upon dilution .",
    "indeed , the exponent has been found@xcite to be @xmath42 experimentally .",
    "monte carlo studies also yield a negative value@xcite . interestingly , with the application of a field , the rfim specific heat is again found to be divergent in experiments@xcite , with @xmath43 , as discussed below .",
    "one way to utilize scaling functions is to attempt to collapse the experimental data onto a scaling function of the appropriate scaling argument .",
    "the collapse will only work well if the critical parameters used in the data collapse are correct .",
    "the rfim scaling behavior of the free energy , for example , is expected to have the form@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the zero - field transition temperature , @xmath47 is a small mean - field ( mf ) parameter , @xmath48 is the zero - field specific heat exponent , and @xmath49 is the rfim crossover exponent . when a new phase transition occurs at @xmath50 , the asymptotic limit of the specific heat can be obtained@xcite from the free energy in the limit @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , this becomes @xmath55 which is symmetric above and below @xmath56 .",
    "note that the field dependence of the peak amplitude is dependent on @xmath57 . in the scaling plots ,",
    "both the shape and the field dependent amplitude must be correct for the data to collapse onto a single scaling function .",
    "the scaling behavior of the specific heat has been experimentally demonstrated for both @xmath9 , where no transition takes place@xcite , and @xmath10 , where a new transition occurs@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the critical parameters can be determined accurately by the quality of the data collapse onto a single scaling function .",
    "the most accurate measurements have been obtained using the optical linear birefringence technique which has been shown to faithfully represent the magnetic specific heat behavior@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the experimental data for the @xmath10 system @xmath2 , when divided by @xmath58 , collapse onto a single scaling function if @xmath42 and @xmath59 , the latter having been determined by measurements on @xmath60 with several different concentrations@xcite and predicted@xcite to be a few percent larger than the zero - field staggered susceptibility exponent measured@xcite to be @xmath61 .",
    "note that if the rfim specific heat exponent @xmath54 , as indicated by the asymptotic shape of the curve , the random - exchange exponent must have the value @xmath42 , which is consistent with the earlier value @xmath62 obtained@xcite by fitting the data from a lower magnetic concentration sample with @xmath63 to a power law .",
    "hence , both the shape and field - dependent amplitude of the critical peak are consistent with @xmath54 , i.e.  a symmetric , logarithmic divergence .",
    "further evidence that @xmath57 is close to zero is obtained from faraday rotation experiments under constant field or constant temperature .",
    "faraday measurements yield the critical behavior of the specific heat , but with a different field amplitude than the specific heat peaks . near the phase transition",
    "it was shown by kleemann , et al .",
    "@xcite , that @xmath64 which becomes , for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 which becomes , for @xmath65 , @xmath68 the field dependent amplitudes of logarithmic peaks have been measured with the results @xmath69 and @xmath70 . with the measured value @xmath71 , these two equations yield @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the values @xmath42 from the @xmath2 experiment@xcite and @xmath62 from the @xmath74 experiment@xcite .",
    "hence , the field dependent amplitudes as well as the peak shapes are all consistent with @xmath75 .",
    "a scaling analysis would similarly require @xmath76 in the case of faraday rotation for a good data collapse .",
    "the result @xmath76 from experiments contradicts the monte carlo result@xcite @xmath77 .",
    "we next turn to the scattering function , which should obey scaling properties close to @xmath56 . within the static approximation@xcite ,",
    "the intensity of the magnetic critical scattering from high quality single crystal magnetic systems is proportional to the fourier transform of the spin - spin correlation function @xmath78 $ ] convoluted with the instrumental resolution , where the @xmath79 brackets signify a thermal average and the @xmath80 @xmath81 $ ] brackets signify a configurational average .",
    "the spin - spin correlation can be expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83\\ ] ] is the staggered susceptibility and @xmath84\\ ] ] is the disconnected susceptibility . for line shapes obtained at one value of the field ,",
    "we expect a scaling function that only depends on the ratio @xmath36 of the two physically relevant inverse length scales . for @xmath85 , @xmath86 for pure , translationally invariant systems @xmath87 . for random systems , on the other hand , @xmath88 may have a @xmath37 dependent contribution . in particular , in rfim systems ,",
    "such a term is induced by the random field , giving@xcite for @xmath85 at constant @xmath35 , @xmath89 hence , @xmath90 involves two possibly independent scaling functions , @xmath91 and @xmath92 and two possibly independent exponents @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this makes the method of collapsing data onto scaling functions extremely difficult since the contributions to the data from the two scaling functions are not easily separable .    to fit the data we must , in principle , use data only in the range of small @xmath95 ( i.e. small @xmath31 ) and @xmath96 in order to be sure we are dealing with asymptotic behavior .",
    "in the study of @xmath11 , data were used in the range @xmath32 to obtain the most reliable exponents and amplitude ratios , since this was shown to be in the asymptotic range for pure ising behavior in specific heat critical behavior@xcite measurements . in the @xmath2 experiments",
    ", we used data for @xmath32 since this is the range for which the specific heat shows the rfim logarithmic behavior@xcite .",
    "however , we typically use a wide range of @xmath96 .",
    "the crossover at large @xmath96 is relatively unimportant since the critical scattering intensity becomes very small . on the other hand , including data at large @xmath96 helps to set the level of background scattering .",
    "many scattering critical behavior analyses are done using the simple mf lorentzian for @xmath85 , @xmath97 giving @xmath98 for @xmath27 , consistent with the fact that @xmath99 in mf . since the upper critical dimension , @xmath100 , above which the mf equations are correct , is four or greater , the lorentzian line shape can only be approximate for three dimensions .",
    "deviations from the mf lorentzian line shape should become evident as one approaches the transition temperature and are generally found to be much more important below the transition temperature .",
    "this has been discussed with respect to the pure @xmath10 ising antiferromagnet @xmath11@xcite . scattering data for @xmath11",
    "were analyzed using approximations to the line shapes by fisher and burford@xcite ( bf ) for @xmath101 , @xmath102 and by tarko and fisher@xcite ( tf ) for @xmath103 , @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are fixed to values determined from the numerical studies .",
    "the values are given in table i. the expressions have the correct scaling behavior in the limits @xmath111 and @xmath112 and serve as appropriate interpolation functions between those limits .",
    "we show the critical exponents and amplitude ratios obtained from fits of the data obtained for @xmath113 using these scaling forms in table i as well as theoretically determined universal critical parameters .",
    "the experimental and theoretical values serve to contrast those from similar analyses done on the diluted system @xmath2 to be discussed next .",
    "the corrections to mf are only significant for @xmath34 and are most significant for @xmath103 .",
    "since many @xmath10 studies do not probe critical behavior any closer than this to @xmath8 , the lorentzian line shape generally serves satisfactorily for extracting estimates of the critical exponents . obviously , more precise measurements that probe regions of smaller @xmath31 can yield much more accurate critical parameters , but only if a suitable line shape is used .",
    "data for the pure @xmath9 case of @xmath114 has been analyzed in a similar manner@xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath115 and an analysis using the mf lorentzian fails markedly below @xmath46 .",
    "the appropriate tf and fb equations , in contrast , yield critical behavior consistent with the @xmath9 ising model .",
    "the scattering function for the dilute antiferromagnet is predicted to have an additional term not present in the pure case@xcite that may affect experimentally determined to corrections to scaling and , possibly , measurements of the amplitude ratio for @xmath5 .",
    "the exponents are probably not influenced since this extra contribution vanishes as @xmath116 .",
    "a fit to a simple lorentzian seems to work reasonably well for data with @xmath34 in the very dilute antiferromagnet @xmath117 . for the random - exchange ising model@xcite , @xmath118 , which is similar to the value for the pure case .",
    "hence , it is reasonable that the lorentzian line shape works well in this reduced temperature range just as it does in the pure @xmath10 ising case . for data closer to @xmath8 , however , just as in the pure case , we would expect deviations from the mf lorentzian , particularly for @xmath119 . unlike the tarko - fisher case for the pure ising model ,",
    "no approximants have been worked out for the random - exchange model for use in data analyses beyond mf .",
    "one possible approach is to use the same tf and fb expressions developed for the pure case .",
    "this assumes that the line shapes for the pure and reim are very similar .",
    "such an approach was successfully employed to analyze the data for the dilute @xmath9 antiferromagnet@xcite .",
    "another strategy is to use the same forms , but to let the tf / fb parameters be free fitting parameters .",
    "such functions would satisfy scaling in the proper limits and would hopefully be very good interpolative functions between those limits .",
    "we will describe below results for @xmath2 obtained using the latter of these two methods .",
    "we next turn to the more difficult case of the random - field scattering in @xmath2 , which occurs for @xmath1 . in the case",
    "studied @xmath120 .",
    "we expect the scattering function for @xmath85 to be @xmath121 taking into consideration the instrumental resolution as well as the two separate scaling functions , there is little chance of using the data directly to determine the two independent scaling functions .",
    "hence , we must start with model functions and test their appropriateness .",
    "the first natural test functions to use in the data analysis are the mf scaling ones@xcite , @xmath122 where we might expect the amplitudes @xmath123 and @xmath124 to be temperature dependent , since @xmath125 and @xmath126 are not , in fact , zero .",
    "we did such an analysis previously@xcite and found reasonable fits at all temperatures in the sense that the line shapes yielded values of @xmath95 and @xmath127 .",
    "however , when an attempt was made to fit these values to power law behaviors , reasonable results were obtained above the transition but not below",
    ". the results above @xmath56 are @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "these values are consistent with results above @xmath56 , obtained@xcite for @xmath130 using a mf analysis . at these lower concentrations",
    ", equilibrium critical behavior is not obtained below @xmath56 , but the data analysis was done well above @xmath56 where equilibrium prevails .",
    "we note that the failure of the mf analysis below @xmath56 is very similar to the situation observed@xcite in the pure @xmath9 antiferromagnet @xmath114 .",
    "the mf equations fail in that case because @xmath9 is far from the upper critical dimension @xmath131 and @xmath115 in contrast with the pure @xmath10 case where @xmath132 .",
    "the tf expression developed for @xmath9 served nicely for the data analysis and agreement was found with theory .",
    "interestingly , the fb scaling function for @xmath101 is not very different from the mf one . for the @xmath10 rfim",
    ", the value of @xmath125 is predicted to be even larger , perhaps as large as @xmath133 .",
    "hence , it is not that surprising that the mf data analysis fails below @xmath56 in this case . to proceed",
    ", we must go beyond a simple mf line shape analysis .",
    "since there is not yet a theoretical line shape available beyond mf , we must try to use scaling properties to guide us .",
    "however , if there are two independent scaling functions , as in eq .",
    "24 , the task becomes formidable .",
    "fortunately , there are two approximations motivated by theoretical@xcite and simulation@xcite works .",
    "the first is that @xmath134 , a limiting case of the schwartz - soffer@xcite inequality @xmath135 .",
    "the second is that @xmath136 is a very good approximation .",
    "we adopt these two simplifications , making the scattering function for @xmath85 the more manageable expression @xmath137 it is not clear at this point how accurate these approximations are . however , it is not possible to proceed without them and they appear to be well justified .",
    "it is highly unlikely that experiments will be able to test the validity of the assumptions directly .",
    "only further theoretical progress can provide a better starting point for the data analysis .",
    "note that the mf expression in eq .",
    "24 is a special case of this for @xmath138 .",
    "we are still faced with the correction to instrumental resolution , however , which itself depends on the line shape we are trying to determine@xcite .",
    "hence , it is still hard to scale the data directly without an explicit functional form for @xmath91 . to simplify the procedure further , therefore ,",
    "we have adopted as our scaling functions the tf and fb scaling functions except that we allow all the parameters to vary .",
    "hence , we are assured of the proper scaling in the limiting cases of @xmath139 and @xmath140 and hopefully the interpolation between these limits will be adequate with the parameters determined from the fits of the data .",
    "unfortunately , the usual technique of fitting each scan separately , where a scan is made in @xmath37 at fixed @xmath7 , and then extracting the exponents from power law fits to the resulting @xmath95 and @xmath5 can not work well since there are now so many free parameters , including the various exponents , amplitudes and the tf / fb parameters .",
    "we can , however , fit all the data scans simultaneously , since the line shape parameters are all the same for every temperature for @xmath119 and @xmath141 and the critical exponents are the same for all @xmath7 .",
    "the new technique has the advantage over the more classic technique in that the line shape does not need to be known beforehand . in the rfim ,",
    "the line shape is both unknown and far from the mf prediction , so the classic method using the mf line shapes failed to yield the critical behavior parameters .",
    "our new procedure using the tf and fb line shapes with variable parameters and fitting all the data simultaneously , on the other hand , was successfully employed for the @xmath1 random - field ising behaviors in @xmath2 and yielded both the critical behavior parameters and the critical scattering line shapes .",
    "both the classic and new techniques worked well for the @xmath0 case in which the line shapes are nearly mean - field and much simpler than the rfim ones .",
    "this demonstrates the reliability of the new technique and we can apply it with some confidence to the rfim , where the more classical technique fails to yield results .",
    "adding to the difficulty of implementing scaling in the scattering line shape analysis is the necessity to account for significant instrumental resolution corrections .",
    "the instrumental resolution can be measured for a particular spectrometer configuration by measuring the width of the magnetic bragg scattering peak at low temperatures .",
    "the bragg scans in the transverse , longitudinal and vertical directions well below the transition temperature yield the response to scattering from the bragg peak .",
    "theoretically , the bragg peak is a delta function and in practice is much more narrow than the instrumental resolution in good quality crystals .",
    "since the scattering in these anisotropic crystals is well described within the static approximation , the scans in the three directions yield the widths along the three principal axes of the resolution ellipsoid .",
    "if we have a theoretical line shape , we can use the measured bragg scattering scans to numerically integrate the line shape which can then be compared directly with the scattering data .",
    "alternatively , other groups have used gaussian ( or with less accuracy triangular ) approximations to the bragg scans and then analytically integrated to obtain the resolution corrections . in this study",
    "we exclusively use the numerical integration technique . for resolution curves measured at uniform steps in @xmath37",
    ", we have for the intensity in transverse data scans , @xmath142 where the sums are over @xmath143 , @xmath47 , and @xmath144 and @xmath145 accounts for imperfect alignment in the transverse direction . for a well aligned crystal ,",
    "@xmath145 is usually much smaller than the resolution width in the transverse direction .",
    "misalignments along the vertical and longitudinal directions are generally inconsequential for a well aligned crystal since the resolutions are much courser in these directions than in the transverse one .",
    "@xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the approximately gaussian bragg line shapes measured at low @xmath7 using evenly spaced steps in @xmath37 .",
    "this is the technique explained@xcite in detail in the context of the study of @xmath11 .",
    "if a crystal has a small mosaic , this can also be approximately taken into account in the same manner .",
    "to fit the resolution - convoluted line shape to the scattering data , we use a nonlinear least squares fitting routine to determine the parameters of the theoretical line shape and critical exponents . note that with each iteration of the fitting program , the line shape must be reintegrated over the resolution ellipsoid since the amount of correction from the resolution convolution depends on the line shape and , hence , the fitted parameters .",
    "since the resolution correction in neutron scattering experiments is substantial and line shape dependent , it is very difficult to determine the line shape directly from the data .",
    "hence , in the absence of a theoretical model , we must choose a trial function that satisfies the correct scaling requirements and allows suitable flexibility in the fits of the data .",
    "our strategy is to use the tf and fb line shapes described above .    for the experiments we used two samples of @xmath2 .",
    "one is the same large sample used in specific heat experiments@xcite .",
    "it is somewhat irregular in shape and has a mass of 1.35 g. the magnetic concentration gradient limited the range of data unaffected by rounding to @xmath149 .",
    "the second is a slice cut from the large sample with its faces perpendicular to the magnetic concentration gradient .",
    "it is approximately one tenth the mass of the original sample .",
    "the smaller sample was used to obtain data closer to the transition with @xmath150 .",
    "the data from both samples were used simultaneously in the data fits with different instrumental resolution corrections appropriate to the two samples and the spectrometer configurations used to make measurements on them .",
    "neutron scattering measurements were made at the oak ridge national laboratory high flux isotope reactor using a two - axis spectrometer configuration .",
    "we used the ( 0 0 2 ) reflection of pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) at an energy of @xmath151 mev to monochromate the beam .",
    "we mainly employed two different collimation configurations .",
    "the lower resolution , primarily used for the large sample , is with 70 min of arc before the monochromator , 20 before the sample and 20 after the sample .",
    "primarily for the thin sample , we made scans with 10 min of arc before and after the sample .",
    "two pg filters were used to eliminate higher - order scattering .",
    "the carbon thermometry scale was calibrated to agree with recent specific heat results @xcite for the @xmath0 transition .",
    "the field dependence of the thermometry was also calibrated .",
    "all scans used in this report , other than those used for obtaining the resolution ellipsoid , are transverse ones about the ( 1  0  0 ) antiferromagnetic bragg point .",
    "we applied the techniques described above to the random - exchange behavior ( @xmath0 ) , where there is only one term in the scattering function for @xmath85 .",
    "we first did the fits using the mf line shapes imposed by setting @xmath152 and @xmath105 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 equal to zero .",
    "the results for the fitted critical parameters are essentially identical to the results from the conventional method of fitting each scan to obtain the temperature dependent correlation and susceptibility and subsequently fitting them to extract the exponents and amplitude ratios .",
    "the results are shown in table i. we include the expressions for the normalized @xmath155 in the table , which are most useful for relative comparisons between fits .",
    "the values are not close enough to unity to consider the fitting functions statistically perfect ones",
    ". very small systematic errors from the resolution corrections and the approximations in the line shapes can easily account for values of @xmath155 being somewhat larger than unity .",
    "the goodness of the fits are better judged from the scaling plots discussed below .",
    "the agreement between the two methods of fitting the data gives us some confidence in fitting the field data , for which the line shape is unknown , using the technique in which all data are simultaneously fit .",
    "we proceed beyond mf by doing the fits with the tf and bf parameters as free parameters .",
    "the fitting results are again shown in table ii .",
    "the range of data was restricted to the reduced temperature range @xmath156 and includes 2198 data .",
    "the results for the critical exponents and amplitudes are not very different from the previous result and the line shape is not very different from the mf one . when examining individual scans , we observe no systematic deviations of the data from the fit at any temperature for which data were included in the fit .",
    "we show representative scans in fig .  1 , including data above and below @xmath8",
    ". no systematic deviations of the data from the fits are evident , indicating that the line shapes work well for the data within the range of @xmath31 used in the fits . to demonstrate that the data are well described by the fitted scaling function",
    ", we subtract the scattering background from them , deconvolute them with the instrumental resolution , divide them by @xmath157 and plot them versus @xmath36 in fig .  2 .",
    "the data from the two samples are plotted separately , but the solid curves are identical in the two cases .",
    "the scatter of the data for the small sample simply reflects the smaller size and the resulting lower count rate .",
    "however , some of the data from the small sample are taken much closer to @xmath8 , since the rounding from the concentration gradient is less significant .",
    "the data close to @xmath8 are very important in the fits .",
    "the consistent results obtained using mf and scaling line shapes in the analyses give us confidence that the scaling technique may work well even in cases where the line shapes are very far from being mf , as in the rfim case we describe next .    for the rfim case , the procedure is identical to the random - exchange one above , except that the scattering function involves the more complicated expression in eq .  25 . in one fit",
    ", we restricted the data range to @xmath32 , with 2444 data , since this is the temperature range over which the asymptotic logarithmic specific heat behavior is observed@xcite . in a second fit , we further restricted the temperature range to @xmath158 , with 1000 data , to test whether crossover effects were still significant .",
    "the fitting results are shown in table iii .",
    "the two fits are rather consistent , suggesting that the results are close to the asymptotic ones . in fig .",
    "3 we show data and the corresponding fits for a few scans to show that there are no significant systematic deviations . after determining the line shape parameters and critical exponents , we used a procedure similar to that described above to demonstrate that the data collapse onto scaling functions for @xmath119 and @xmath141 .",
    "we subtracted the scattering background , deconvoluted the data with the instrumental resolutions , divided by @xmath159 and , for clarity , plotted the results versus @xmath160 instead of simply @xmath36 so that the data for @xmath161 and @xmath162 do not overlap .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in fig .",
    "the data from the large and small samples are shown separately .",
    "we have obtained from the scaling analysis not only the critical parameters but adequate approximations to the line shape scaling functions for both the @xmath10 random - exchange and random - field ising models .",
    "we already have the @xmath9 and @xmath10 pure line shapes from the tf and fb expressions .",
    "it is instructive to compare all of these to the mf lorentzian line shapes .",
    "the comparisons are shown in fig .  5 , where we have plotted scaling functions versus @xmath36 .",

    "more significant deviations from mf are apparent .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental results obtained using @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath10 experimental random - exchange scaling functions indicate that there is not much difference between the pure and random - exchange line shapes for @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , for the random - field case , the deviations from mf found in the experiments are very large for @xmath162 in comparison to the pure and random - exchange @xmath10 ising models . even in the case for @xmath161",
    "the deviations are large relative to the other @xmath10 models .",
    "the very large deviations for @xmath162 are consistent with the failure of the mf lorentzian line shape in producing values for @xmath95 and @xmath5 that obey power law behavior . for the pure @xmath9 ising model , shown as a reference for non - mf behavior , the results for @xmath162 are the largest of the examples shown , whereas the behavior for @xmath141 is not far from mf .",
    "we see from this comparison of the scaling functions , particularly for @xmath119 , that mf behavior is fairly well followed for the @xmath10 pure and random - exchange models , whereas for the random - field case , where the upper critical dimension has significantly increased to @xmath163 , the line shapes are very non - lorentzian .",
    "determining the line shape from the scattering data is difficult .",
    "we have achieved an approximate determination of the proper line shapes .",
    "once theoretical results give a more firm foundation for the trial function for the scattering line shape , we will be able to give a more concrete comparison of the experiments to theory and simulations .    in table",
    "iv we show the results of the critical exponents for the specific heat and neutron scattering rfim experiments compared with simulation results . for the pure @xmath10 ising model , the experimentally determined universal exponents and amplitude ratios agree very well with theoretical and simulation results .",
    "the experimental results from neutron scattering were obtained using the tf and fb line shapes .",
    "the specific heat was obtained using both pulsed heat and birefringence techniques and clearly can be considered to be exceedingly well characterized .",
    "for the reim , we again have excellent agreement between experiment and monte carlo simulations .",

    "this case can also be considered well characterized .",
    "the rfim case shows mixed results when the experimental exponents are compared with those from simulations .",
    "the scattering results for @xmath164 and @xmath93 are quite consistent with the simulation values .",
    "the exponent @xmath165 has not been reliably measured yet and its comparison with simulation results is very important .",
    "the most glaring inconsistency is between the simulation and experimental values of @xmath48 , where the experiments indicate a symmetric , logarithmic divergence and the simulations indicate a non - divergent peak .",
    "this inconsistency deserves further study .",
    "although we have achieved fits to the data obtained in equilibrium scattering experiments using @xmath2 , the asymptotic behavior is only observed very close to @xmath56 at @xmath166  t. our results may be somewhat influenced by the effects of crossover to random - exchange behavior .",
    "we hope in the future to do these experiments at much higher fields to ensure that the results we have obtained in this study are close to the asymptotic ones .",
    "in addition , by using apparatus capable of reaching much higher fields , we can study the scaling behavior of the scattering line shapes as a function of @xmath167 in a similar way to our treatment of the specific heat .",
