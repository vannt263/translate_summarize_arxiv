    "the accurate knowledge of the properties of static and rotating compact stars ( css ) are of utmost importance to probe the behaviour of the equation of state ( eos ) of superdense matter .",
    "even the accurate information on the maximum gravitational mass @xmath1 for the static cs and its radius @xmath8 with the canonical mass ( @xmath9 ) , not yet well known , would narrow down the choices for the plausible eoss to just a few .",
    "the newly measured cs mass 1.76@xmath10 of psr j0437 - 4715 @xcite is obtained by the precise determination of the orbital inclination angle , the highest measured mass for any known pulsar to date .",
    "recent observations of the thermal emission from the quiescent lmxb x7 in the globular cluster 47 tuc yield the value of r@xmath11 to be 14.5@xmath12 km @xcite .",
    "the binary pulsars psr j0737 - 3039a , b with masses of the individual star being @xmath13 and @xmath14 are plausible candidates for the measurement the moment of inertia due to the spin - orbit coupling effects @xcite .",
    "it is expected that a reasonably accurate value of @xmath2 can be deduced from the moment of inertia measurement of psr j0737 - 3039a @xcite .    rotating css discovered until recent past have periods of rotation close to one millisecond .",
    "the first millisecond pulsar psr b1937 + 214 rotating at the frequency @xmath15 was discovered in 1982 @xcite . in year 2006 , a more rapid pulsar psr j1748 - 2446ad rotating at @xmath16 hz was detected @xcite .",
    "such frequencies are too low to affect significantly the structure of css with @xmath17 @xcite , since , these css have the keplerian ( mass - shedding ) frequencies larger than 1000hz",
    ". very recent discovery of x - ray transient xte j1739 - 285 by kaaret et al @xcite suggests that it contains a cs rotating at 1122hz . following this discovery ,",
    "the structure of the cs rotating with 1122hz are studied using several eoss @xcite .",

    "@xmath20 is the maximum baryonic mass of the static cs and @xmath21 is the minimum mass for the cs rotating with 1122hz for a given eos .    in the present work we search for the possible correlations in some key properties of static css and the ones rotating with the highest observed frequency of 1122hz .",
    "the properties of these css are computed for a large set of eoss , which are constructed using variety of approaches with the chemical compositions ranging from nucleons to hyperons and quarks in @xmath0-equilibrium .",
