    "subtracting the drude components and the high energy interband transitions from @xmath14@xmath15(@xmath9 ) , we then get a clear picture of the absorption peaks and their splitting in fig .",

    "the splitting energies @xmath22 and @xmath23 are almost the same , hence those peaks should have a similar origin . the apparent spectral difference for nbse@xmath1 and cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 indicates cr intercalation is not a simple charge transfer process . detailed information about the band structure is required .",
    "we note that the spectral difference ( i.e. the splitting of the interband transitions ) at 100 k and 130 k in the near - infrared region is obscure .",
    "this is understandable as those features in r(@xmath9 ) are close to the reflectivity minimum and the overall peak strengths are rather weak . in addition , both t=100 k and 130k are very close to the fm transition temperature ( 115k ) , therefore fluctuation effect is also prone to influence the spectra near the critical temperature . on the other hand , in our overcoating technique for reflectance measurement ,",
    "the sample is not in exchange gas but in vacuum ( better than 3@xmath24 torr ) , the measurement becomes relatively surface sensitive in such high energy , a more detailed inspection of temperature variations in @xmath10 for the fm phase , which requires to keep the sample at low temperature for a long time , becomes impractical .",
    "however , the splitting indeed turns more apparent as the temperature goes down to 50 and 10 k from our current data , which confirms the connection between the splitting in the optical conductivity and the fm ordering .",

    "each nb is in trigonal prismatic coordination with six se neighbors , so the nb 4__d _ _ states are split into : a@xmath26 ( _ _ d__@xmath27 ) state , e@xmath2 doublet ( _ _ d__@xmath28 ; _ _ d__@xmath29 ) , and e@xmath2 doublet ( _ _ d__@xmath30 ; _ _ d__@xmath31 ) . far below the fermi energy , the total density of states are of se 4__p _ _ character .",
    "the tail of this se band hybridizes with nb ( a@xmath26 , e@xmath2 ) complex and extends above e@xmath6 .",
    "a high density of states at the fermi energy consists with the optical observation of a well - defined plasma edge in 2@xmath3-nbse@xmath1 .",
    "we note that the partially filled nb conduction band is frequently referred to as `` _",
    "_ d__@xmath27 '' band in the early studies .",
    "however , recent calculation on 2@xmath3-nbse@xmath1@xcite show that the half - filled conduction band has _ _ d__@xmath27 symmetry around the @xmath32 point of the brillouin zone , and ( _ _ d__@xmath29 , _ _",

    "similar result is reproduced in fig . 5 ( a ) , that both a@xmath26 ( _ _ d__@xmath27 ) and e@xmath2 ( _ _ d__@xmath29 , d@xmath28 ) contribute to the pdos of the half - filled conduction band .",
    "figure 5 ( c ) to ( e ) shows the pdos for cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 in the fm ground state .",
    "since cr is in a trigonally distorted crse@xmath34 octahedron,@xcite the cr 3__d _ _ bands are split into t@xmath35 ( which is further split into a@xmath26 and e@xmath2 ) and e@xmath2 states . in the spin up channel ,",
    "the cr e@xmath2 state is localized and fully occupied ; while the cr a@xmath26 state and e@xmath2 doublet have weak itinerant character , and strongly hybridize with nb conduction band in the range -0.5@xmath120.5 ev across e@xmath6 .",
    "all the spin down cr 3__d _ _ bands are unoccupied . from fig .",
    "5 ( g ) and ( h ) , one will find that cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 is metallic with a fermi level crossing in both spin directions .    comparing with 2@xmath3-nbse@xmath1 ,",
    "the half - filled nb conduction band is now almost filled up in cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 , with a large removal of dos at the fermi energy , leading to a marked reduction in the free carrier spectral weight .",
    "although there is a strong hybridization between cr t@xmath35 ( @xmath7 ) and e@xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) states near e@xmath6 , the occupied nb states in the spin down projection is almost unaffected after intercalation , besides a shift of the chemical potential .",
    "in comparison with the band structure calculations , we can identify the origin of the experimental interband transitions ( associated with the joint density of states ) at low _",
    "t_.    for nbse@xmath1 , the close - to - e@xmath6 interband transition from occupied se to unoccupied nb states is the origin of the first peak around 12000 @xmath8 in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) . while the second peak at 20000 @xmath8 is the nb",
    "_ d _ to _ d _ hopping from e@xmath6 to the lowest empty state .",
    "such _ d_-_d _ transition is not forbidden with the help of se 4__p _ _ hybridization .    for cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 ,",
    "all possible low - energy ( @xmath361.5 ev ) interband transitions in the fm ground state include cr - to - cr , nb - to - nb , and cr - to - nb ( also nb - to - cr ) transitions .",
    "note the pdos scales for fig .",
    "5 ( c)-(e ) are different that cr has apparently larger density of states than that of nb or se , so cr - cr and cr - nb transitions should dominate the low - energy interband optical peaks . as shown in fig .",
    "5 ( g ) , cr e@xmath2(@xmath7 ) bands have rather special dispersion : they are flat near the band bottom and top but dispersive elsewhere ( which can be better resolved along a - l - h - a ) , so it has a double - peak pdos .",
    "then the two peaks , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , in @xmath10 mainly come from the spin up cr a@xmath26@xmath37cr e@xmath2 transition , and the @xmath20 ( 1.04 ev ) and @xmath21 ( 1.30 ev ) peaks are mainly contributed by the occupied spin up nb ( a@xmath26 , e@xmath2)@xmath37cr e@xmath2 transition .",
    "other cr - cr or cr - nb transitions exceed the energy scope in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) , while the low energy se - nb transition in nbse@xmath1 shifts to higher energies because cr intercalation raises the chemical potential .",
    "the predicted interband contribution in @xmath10 from the lsda calculation are shown in fig . 5 ( f ) .",
    "the experimental data with the removal of the drude component are also presented for comparison . in general",
    ", the theoretical result qualitatively reproduces the experimental observation of a four - peak character in the low energy optical response .      since the curie - weiss pm state is a spin - disorder system , that the orientation and amplitude of neighboring spins would fluctuate with temperature",
    ", one can not calculate the pm band from first - principles .",
    "however , the band modification across the fm transition can be speculated from the changes in optical interband transitions .    as cr e@xmath2(@xmath7 ) is the common final state for the four interband transitions in the fm ground state , then the two - to - four splitting of the optical peaks should be caused by a splitting , or more generally , a band broadening , in this common e@xmath2 state .",
    "provided cr e@xmath2(@xmath7 ) turns narrower in the pm state , then the interband transitions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are indistinguishable .",
    "the band width for a correlated electronic system is related to the hopping integral between neighboring sites , then the long - range ordering of cr local moment favors a broader bandwidth from pm to fm state .",
    "the spin up cr a@xmath26 and e@xmath2 have partial itinerant character with a pdos `` tail '' at e@xmath6 ( fig . 5 ( c ) ) .",
    "therefore the lowering ( i.e. gain ) of the kinetic energy of carriers in the fm transition would lead to the conduction band broadening.@xcite here the phase transition does not apparently change the drude response in cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 , indicating the conducting carriers are mainly of nb 4__d _ _ character , thus are less affected by possible effective mass reduction when the cr - derived bands turn broadener in the fm phase .    as shown above , the interband peak splitting is a band broadening effect in cr e@xmath2 doublet , now further discussions on other possibilities are necessary .",
    "one possible cause for the band modification is a structure distortion , which splits the degenerated e@xmath2 into two separated states .",
    "here we should emphasize that the relaxed se position in our calculation indicates a trigonal distorted crse@xmath34 octahedra ( along the c - axis ) in the fm ground state , but it apparently does not change the degeneracy of the e@xmath2 doublet ( d@xmath31 ; d@xmath30 ) .",
    "in fact , the double - peak pdos for cr e@xmath2(@xmath7 ) is not two separated states , but due to special band dispersion , so the splitting of the optical peaks is not caused by possible structural distortion .",
    "another possible case is the exchange splitting .",
    "regardless of the detailed band structure for this specific material , the splitting in the interband transition for a ferromagnet is generally attributed to the exchange splitting : when magnetism is on the itinerant side , then the pm phase will have some set of absorption peaks , and in the fm phase each of them will split into two , reflecting the fact that the exchange splitting is not rigid . however , our band structure calculations rule out such a possibility . as shown in fig",
    "5 ( c ) , although the spin up cr a@xmath26 and e@xmath2 have a weak itinerant character , the cr 3__d _ _ bands are mainly localized , therefore the dominating magnetic mechanism for cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 is away from the itinerant side . in the curie - weiss pm state ,",
    "the cr 3__d _ _ local moments do not vanish . then the only close - to - e@xmath6 band which might experience spin polarization from the pm to fm state is the nb 4__d _ _ conduction band ( fig .",
    "5 ( d ) ) .",
    "however , one can not find any nb - related interband transitions which satisfy : 1 ) a 0.5@xmath120.7 ev and 1@xmath121.2 ev gap for both spin projections ; and 2 ) a 0.25 ev energy difference for the common hopping in different spin channels ( as a 2000 @xmath8 splitting from optical measurements ) .",
    "in fact , the magnetic moment for nb atom is less than 0.03@xmath40 ( while cr moment is 2.6@xmath40 ) from our calculation , hence the nb spin polarization is so weak that it can be neglected , so the splitting of the interband transitions is irrelevant to the exchange splitting",
    ".    here some complementary discussion on the pm band structure should also be added . in the curie - weiss",
    "paramagnetic state , there is no spin polarization for the energy band , then the optical response from different spin channels have equal contribution to @xmath10 .",
    "as shown above , we conclude that the `` spin up '' cr e@xmath2 turns narrower in the pm state . here the spin label was used to better describe this specific band when comparing with the fm case .",
    "one should keep in mind that the two spin channels are mixed in the pm state , reflecting the fluctuation of the local spins .",
    "however , such a band mixing will not bring new low - energy interband transitions .",
    "note @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( i=1,2 ) are all come from cr - related bands , which are mainly localized and has a large splitting in different spin projections in the fm ground state ( fig . 5 ( c ) ) ;",
    "furthermore , possible spin polarization in the fm state for the nb and se related bands are rather weak , then the band mixing in the pm state will not bring new peaks for the low frequency @xmath10 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the qualitative electronic structure around fermi level for cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 is not sensitive to the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath41 of cr site due to the strong cr - nb hybridization .",
    "we have tried a lsda+@xmath41 ( @xmath41=3.0 ev for cr site ) calculation , the low energy optical conductivity is not qualitatively changed ( except the @xmath17 and @xmath18 peaks are weaker compared to lsda ) .",
    "we report a combined optical spectroscopy study and first - principles calculations on 2@xmath3-type nbse@xmath1 and the ferromagnetic intercalated compound cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 .",
    "a weak mid - infrared suppression in r(@xmath9 ) of 2@xmath3-nbse@xmath1 testifies the existence of a cdw induced partial gap on the fermi surface . for cr@xmath0nbse@xmath1 , the appearance of new interband transitions and their remarkable _",
    "evolution are direct experimental evidence for the invalidity of the rigid - band model .",
    "the multi - peak feature in @xmath42(@xmath9 ) has been clearly extracted by a drude - lorentz fitting . based on the lsda calculation",
    ", we found that the four optical peaks in the fm phase are interband transitions involving both the intercalated cr 3__d _ _ and the host nb 4__d _ _ states .",
    "considering the temperature evolution for these optical interband transitions , we further conclude that their splitting from pm to fm phase is not an exchange splitting effect , but a dispersion modification ( broadening ) in the spin up cr @xmath43 doublet , which have partial itinerant character and strongly hybridize with nb 4__d _ _ states .",
    "such an evident band broadening in a rather close - to - e@xmath6 3__d _ _ state requires further experimental investigations , which might provide new insight into understanding the ferromagnetism induced band modification across the phase transition .",
