    "localization induced by disorder has been recently observed in ultracold bosonic gases in purely random potentials @xcite and in bichromatic optical lattices @xcite . in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , a bose - einstein condensate of interacting atoms is released from a trap into a speckle potential and the localization effects appear in the low density tails of the spatial distribution of atoms , where the interaction is negligible . in @xcite ,",
    "the interaction between atoms is suppressed from the very beginning by tuning the @xmath0-wave scattering length to zero by means of a feshbach resonance . in both cases ,",
    "the observations have been interpreted in terms of anderson localization @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of one - dimensional ( 1d ) bichromatic lattices is that they allow one to implement the aubry - andr model @xcite , also known as harper model @xcite , for particles in a quasi - periodic potential . in the case of noninteracting particles , this model predicts a sharp transition from diffusion to localization for a given value of the disorder strength . in ultracold gases ,",
    "thanks to the availability of feshbach resonances , the interaction between atoms can be changed almost at will , thus allowing for the investigation of the role played by interaction in the transition from diffusion to localization @xcite .",
    "the effects of interaction have been recently the subject of several theoretical investigations in the case of localization in purely random potentials @xcite and quasi - periodic potentials @xcite , but some results are still controversial .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the aubry - andr model has been recently implemented also in experiments with diffusion of light in photonic lattices @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to understand the interplay between diffusion and localization of an interacting bose - einstein condensate in a 1d bichromatic lattice .",
    "one of the main problems arises from the occurrence of two competing effects of the interaction : on the one hand it favours localization through the self - trapping mechanism @xcite , on the other hand it is expected to destroy the ( anderson ) localization induced by disorder . in order to shed light on these effects and",
    "make a bridge between theoretical results and feasible experiments , we study the following issues : i )  what happens when the two lattices , which are superimposed to create the bichromatic lattice , have commensurate wavelengths ( periodic system ) instead of incommensurate ( quasi - periodic system , as in the aubry - andr model ) ; ii ) what is the role of the initial shape of the condensate ; iii ) what is the role of self - trapping processes .",
    "all these issues have subtle implications in the experimental observability of the crossover between diffusion and localization in an interacting gas .",
    "our calculations show that , if the condensate initially occupies a single lattice site , the dynamics of the gas in the lattice is dominated by self - trapping in a wide range of parameters , even for weak interaction .",
    "conversely , if the diffusion starts from a condensate with gaussian shape , extended over several lattice sites , self - trapping is significantly suppressed and the destruction of localization by interaction is more easily observable .",
    "one - dimensional bichromatic lattices are realized in experiments with bose - einstein condensates by superimposing two optical lattices of different wavelengths , producing an external potential acting on the atoms in this form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the recoil energy and @xmath3 is the dimensionless lattice strength .",
    "one of the two lattices is used as the main periodic potential ( primary lattice ) fixing the bloch band structure of the single - particle states without disorder .",
    "it is usually strong enough ( @xmath4 ) to apply the tight - binding approximation , i.e. , the atoms occupy the sites of the primary lattice and can tunnel from one site to the other with a given tunneling rate @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the second lattice is weaker ( @xmath6 ) and introduces a  deterministic \" disorder , or quasi - disorder @xcite . for a noninteracting gas in such a potential , the evolution of the system is described by the aubry - andr model @xcite , which is obtained from the schrdinger equation by expanding the single - particle wavefunction @xmath7 over a set of wannier states , maximally localized at the minima of the primary lattice in the lowest bloch band , @xmath8 @xcite . in the presence of interactions between the atoms , one can instead start from the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite and use the same procedure in order to get a generalized aubry - andr model which includes an additional nonlinear term that represents the mean - field interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the primary lattice site index , @xmath12 is the ratio between the wavenumbers of the two lattices , @xmath13 is an arbitrary phase , @xmath14 is a complex variable whose modulus square gives the probability of finding a particle at the lattice site @xmath11 . in deriving the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) from the gp equation for a realistic three - dimensional condensate , we assume the condensate to be axially symmetric and elongated in the direction of the lattice , such that the transverse confinement is sufficiently strong to freeze out the radial dynamics and the longitudinal confinement sufficiently weak to be neglected . we have also chosen @xmath15 .",
    "the dimensionless parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the strength of the disorder and of the mean - field interaction , respectively , and are the key parameters of the present work .",
    "the equations of motion are generated by @xmath18 , yielding @xmath19 that can be considered as the gp equation on a discretized lattice .",

    "when @xmath39 ( noninteracting gas ) and @xmath40 is irrational ( quasi - periodic lattice ) , hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) coincides with the well - known aubry - andr model that has been widely studied in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "aubry and andr @xcite analytically proved that the system undergoes a transition from extended to localized states at @xmath38 .",
    "all states are extended for @xmath41 , critical for @xmath38 and exponentially localized for @xmath42 , with the same localization length @xmath43 .",
    "aubry and andr @xcite identified this exponential localization as the anderson localization in a quasi - periodic potential , analog to anderson localization in a purely random potential @xcite .    from the numerical viewpoint , the static spectrum of the aubry - andr hamiltonian can be calculated by solving the following eigenvalue problem @xmath44 and considering a sequence of rational numbers @xmath45 , that converges to an irrational @xmath40 as @xmath46 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the sequence of approximants @xmath45 can be found by successive truncations of the continued - fraction expansion of @xmath40 .",

    "the approximants are obtained by writing @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two consecutive terms of the fibonacci sequence ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 ) .",
    "the incommensurate case can thus be considered as the limit of a sequence of commensurate hamiltonians , whose eigenvalues @xmath53 and eigenfunctions @xmath54 can be labelled by the quasi - momentum @xmath55 and the band index @xmath56 , since the spatial periodicity of the system , with period @xmath57 , permits to use the bloch wave decomposition .",
    "one finds that , for sufficiently large @xmath58 and for @xmath42 , the eigenfunctions are indeed characterized by periodic replica of exponentially localized functions within each period of the potential , that in the limit @xmath46 tend to a single localized function @xcite .",
    "the localization transition at @xmath38 can be observed also in the dynamics ( quantum diffusion ) , by looking for example at the width of the wavepacket as a function of the time @xcite . in particular , in the quasi - periodic lattice , the asymptotic spreading of the wavepacket width @xmath35 can be parametrized as @xmath59 , and one finds three different regimes :    * @xmath41 : ballistic regime , @xmath60 * @xmath38 : sub - diffusive regime , @xmath61 * @xmath42 : localized regime , @xmath62 .",

    ", one can see that the asymptotic behaviour is not affected by the choice of the initial shape of the wavepacket .",
    "it is worth stressing that a truly quasi - periodic potential can not be realized in any realistic experiment with ultracold atoms , since the system is finite and the ratio of the frequencies of the two laser beams is a rational number .",
    "it is thus important to clarify to which extent the predictions of the aubry - andr model are relevant for the description of current experiments in bichromatic lattices . to this purpose",

    "the system is periodic , with wavelength @xmath57 , and the diffusion of an initially localized wavepacket is expected to be ballistic ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath64 one must recover the results of the aubry - andr model , with a critical behaviour for @xmath38 and localized states for @xmath65 .",
    "the approach to this limit in nontrivial and involves the characteristic time and length scales of the system .    in fig .",

    "the asymptotic behaviour ( @xmath75 ) is always ballistic .",
    "however , for a finite @xmath20 and for @xmath42 the central part of the density distribution ( within a width of order @xmath57 ) exhibits an exponential localization , independent of @xmath58 , and is almost indistinguishable from the one predicted for the incommensurate lattice .",

    "it is worth stressing , however , that these effects of the low density tails are expected to be hardly detectable in actual experiments , due to the finite resolution in the measurement of the density distribution .    given the typical timescale @xcite and optical resolution of the experiments with ultracold gases in optical lattices , our analysis confirms that the transition from diffusion to localization observed in ref .",
    "@xcite can correctly be interpreted in terms of the predictions of the aubry - andr model .",
    "in this section we consider the interacting case @xmath76 .",
    "we mainly focus on two effects of the interaction , namely the self - trapping phenomenon and the delocalization induced by the interaction in the regime @xmath42 .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , these two effects are competing and must be carefully analysed in order to correctly interpret the expansion of a wavepacket .",
    "self - trapping is a localization phenomenon , different from anderson localization , that occurs when the interaction is stronger than a critical value @xmath77 , even for a purely periodic system without disorder @xcite and double - well potentials @xcite .",
    "an intuitive understanding of the origin of the self - trapping in a lattice is based on energy conservation arguments @xcite .",
    "let us consider separately the contribution to the energy that comes from the kinetic and potential terms together and the contribution that comes from the interacting term , @xmath78 .",
    "if the gas is subject to a periodic potential in the tight - binding approximation and its dynamics is restricted to the lowest bloch band , as supposed in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , the term @xmath79 in the hamiltonian is upper bounded .",
    "let us call this upper bound @xmath80 . whenever the initial energy of the interacting system is larger than this upper bound , @xmath81",
    ", one can prove that the system can not reach a situation where @xmath82 , at any @xmath83 , without violating the energy conservation .",
    "this means that , under these conditions , part of the interaction energy must be trapped in the system in the form of a localized peak that does not spread . in other words , whenever @xmath81 an initially localized wavepacket can not spread to zero in the whole space .",
    "this argument , in general , does not provide a precise quantitative estimate of the critical value @xmath84 , but it gives a reasonable upper bound .",
    "self - trapping of particles in a 1d quasi - periodic potential for @xmath41 has been already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for the case of purely random potential see @xcite ) . here",
    "we provide a more systematic calculation of @xmath84 and we compare the diffusion from a single - site to the one from a gaussian wavepacket .",
    "a signature of the presence of self - trapping is a saturation of the participation number @xmath85 that , for @xmath86 , reaches an asymptotic finite value , due to the trapping mechanism occurring at the center of the wavepacket , while the width @xmath35 keeps increasing owing to the expanding tails @xcite .",
    "an example of self - trapping transition is shown in fig .",

    "the same figure shows also the difference in the density distributions at @xmath70 : the central peak is well visible in the self - trapped state and it is absent in the diffusive state , while the lateral , low density tails are similar .    by systematically looking at the numerical results for @xmath35 , @xmath85 , @xmath29 in the @xmath17 _ vs. _ @xmath16 plane , we obtain the diagram shown in fig .",

    "we show the results for the two limiting values @xmath90 and @xmath87 ; in particular , in region iii , we find that all states are self - trapped for @xmath90 while they are diffusive for @xmath87 .",
    "the semi - axis @xmath42 and @xmath39 corresponds to the regime of disorder induced localization for noninteracting particles .",
    "the phase dependence of @xmath84 for @xmath42 can be qualitatively explained by the energy conservation arguments already mentioned above . in particular , we numerically calculate the maximum energy , @xmath80 , in the lowest bloch band of the noninteracting single - particle spectrum and we compare this value to the initial energy of the interacting system , which is given by @xmath91 .",
    "the upper bound for the transition to self - trapping is then given by the condition @xmath92 , which implies @xmath93 where the plus and the minus signs holds for @xmath87 and @xmath90 , respectively .",

    "[ fig : self_trapping_2 ] .    fig .",
    "[ fig : self_trapping_2 ] shows that , in the case of diffusion from a single - site , the self - trapping mechanism plays a rather important and nontrivial role , leaving almost no space to the observability of the interplay between disorder and interaction .",
    "the region were this interplay might be observed , namely for @xmath42 and small @xmath17 , where one expects to see the destruction of localization due to interaction , it is also the region where the dependence on the phase @xmath13 is the largest .",
    "unfortunately , in typical experimental situations with bose - einstein condensates , the phase @xmath13 is not controllable .",
    "moreover , in the experiments the initial distribution of atoms in the lattice sites is more similar to a gaussian than a @xmath22-function .",
    "this suggests that , while the single - site diffusion is conceptually important and widely investigated from the theoretical viewpoint , the diffusion from a gaussian is also interesting and worth exploring .    by repeating the same calculation of @xmath84 as before , but starting from a gaussian wavepacket of width @xmath24 , we find two main results : i ) if @xmath24 is of the order of @xmath94 or more , the time evolution of the width , the participation number and the density distribution becomes almost independent of the phase @xmath13 for all values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; ii ) self - trapping is strongly suppressed , especially in the region @xmath42 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delocalization_beta ] for @xmath95 and an initial gaussian of width @xmath96 .",
    "as one can see , self - trapping does not occur even for values of the interaction parameters of the order of @xmath97 .",
    "this fact is important in view of the discussion about the delocalization induced by the interaction , which is the subject of the next section .     as a function of time for @xmath95 and two different values of the interaction strength , @xmath98 ( left column ) and @xmath99 ( right column ) . in the left plot",
    "we compare the time evolution for a single - site @xmath22-function ( red line ) and for gaussian wavepackets with different values of the initial width , @xmath100 ( green line ) , @xmath101 ( blue line ) , @xmath102 ( purple line ) , @xmath103 ( azure line ) while in the right plot we consider only gaussian wavepackets with @xmath104 ( green line ) , @xmath94 ( black line ) , @xmath101 ( blue line ) , @xmath102 ( purple line ) , @xmath103 ( azure line ) .",
    "the curves exhibit the same asymptotic slope , which is 0.23 ( left plot ) and 0.3 ( right plot ) . ]",
    "let us now investigate the interplay of interaction and localization in the diffusion of a gaussian wavepacket , in the regime where the noninteracting system is localized ( @xmath42 ) and for a choice of parameters that rules out self - trapping .",
    "in this case we find that , as the interaction is turned on , a wavepacket that was localized for @xmath39 starts to expand sub - diffusively .",
    "we observe an asymptotic growth of both the width @xmath35 and the participation number @xmath85 , according to the following laws : @xmath105 and @xmath106 with @xmath107 in the range @xmath108 .",
    "the same effect has previously been reported for single - site diffusion in a purely random systems @xcite . in the absence of self - trapping",
    "we find that the coefficients @xmath109 and @xmath110 are nearly equal , therefore in the following we will use @xmath111 .",
    "an example is shown in fig.[fig : delocalization_beta ] where one sees the effects of the interaction on the diffusion of an initial gaussian wavepacket with @xmath96 , and a disorder strength just above the localization transition , @xmath95 .",
    "the noninteracting case , which remains localized , is compared with three different values of the interaction parameter , @xmath112 , @xmath99 and @xmath113 . already for @xmath112",
    "there is an evident delocalization and this effect increases as @xmath17 is increased in the sense that @xmath114 becomes larger and the delocalization takes place earlier .",
    "a very similar behaviour is obtained also for the diffusion from a single - site , provided the phase @xmath13 and the interaction @xmath17 are chosen in such a way to avoid self trapping ( e.g. , in region iii of fig.[fig : self_trapping_2 ] with @xmath87 ) .",
    "when the disorder strength @xmath16 is increased the localization gets more robust , in the sense that the onset of sub - diffusive spreading takes place for later times and @xmath114 becomes smaller . for large @xmath16",
    "we reach a situation where the delocalization process is no longer observable within our simulation time .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : delocalization_lambda ] , where we compare the time evolution of a gaussian wavepacket for fixed @xmath17 and for increasing values of the disorder strength @xmath16 .",

    "in fact , one can see from this figure that there is no visible dependence of the asymptotic slope , @xmath114 , on the initial width .",
    "the role of inter - particle interaction in the destruction of anderson localization is rather nontrivial and is the subject of current investigations both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "here we have considered the case of the exponential localization of a wavepacket in a 1d quasi - periodic potential .",
    "our main goal was to fill the gap between what is predicted by the aubry - andr model for noninteracting particles in such a potential and what can be actually observed in realistic experiments with ultracold bosons in bichromatic optical lattices .",
    "as a first step in this direction , we have studied the diffusion of a noninteracting wavepackets in a commensurate ( periodic ) lattice and we have compared it with the case of an incommensurate ( quasi - periodic ) lattice .",
    "we have shown that the spatial periodicity of the commensurate lattice plays a key role in determining the type of approach to the quasi - periodic limit in a sequence of commensurate approximants .",

    "<S> conversely , if the diffusion starts from a gaussian wavepacket , self - trapping is significantly suppressed and the destruction of localization by interaction is more easily observable . </S>"
