    "silicene is a two dimensional crystal of silicon which has been studied theoretically @xcite and recently experimentally @xcite .",
    "the low energy electronic properties can be described by a dirac hamiltonian , like in graphene , but the electrons are massive due to a relative large spin - orbit coupling @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , silicene has a band gap @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote spin and valley , respectively ) which can be controlled by applying a perpendicular electric field @xmath4",
    "( @xmath5 is the interlattice distance of the buckled honeycomb structure ) to the silicene sheet ( see [ gapsili ] for a plot of the band gap ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that there is a quantum phase transition , from a topological insulator ( ti , @xmath6 ) to a band insulator ( bi , @xmath7 ) , at a charge neutrality point ( cnp ) @xmath8 , where there is a gap cancellation between the perpendicular electric field and the spin - orbit coupling , thus exhibiting a semimetal behavior .",
    "a 2d topological insulator is also known as a quantum spin hall state , and it was theoretically studied in @xcite and first discovered in hgte quantum wells in @xcite .",
    "the common characteristic of a ti - bi transition is a band inversion with a level crossing at some critical value of a control parameter ( electric field , quantum well thickness , etc ) . in this paper",
    "we find that electron - hole entropies of a quantum state ( in a phase - space representation ) also exhibit this crossing / inversion behavior at the cnp , thus providing a new characterization of the ti - bi quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .",
    "the study of phase space properties in quantum systems can be done by using the husimi function of a quantum state @xmath9 , which is defined as the squared overlap between a minimal uncertainty ( coherent ) state @xmath10 and @xmath9 , thus giving the probability of finding the quantum system in a coherent state .",
    "husimi quasiprobability distribution has been useful for a phase - space analysis of metal - insulator transition @xcite , for the study of quantum chaos in physics @xcite , and recently in the analysis of qpts in algebraic models @xcite .",
    "rnyi - wehrl entropies of the husimi function ( see section [ renyiwehrl ] for a definition ) have been proved to be a good marker for qpts of some paradigmatic models like : dicke model @xcite of atom - field interactions ( undergoing a qpt from normal to superradiant ) , vibron model @xcite for triatomic molecules ( undergoing a shape qpt from linear to bent ) and lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite used for example in nuclear physics and quantum optics .",
    "rnyi - wehrl entropy displays either an extreme , or an abrupt change , at the critical point and therefore provides a detector of qpts across the phase diagram of a critical system .    in this work",
    "we shall analyze the topological - band insulator transition in silicene by using these phase - space techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , in section [ hamilsec ] , we shall remind the low energy hamiltonian for silicene , its eigenvectors and eigenvalues . then , in section [ entropysec ] , we will define the husimi function in this model and the rnyi - wehrl entropies of the husimi function . in section [ marker ] we will show that the rnyi - wehrl entropy turns out to be a clear marker of topological - band insulator transitions in silicene . finally , some concluding remarks will be given in the last section .",
    "let us consider a monolayer silicene with external magnetic @xmath11 and electric @xmath12 fields applied perpendicular to the sheet .",
    "the effective low energy hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath3 corresponds to the inequivalent corners @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) of the brillouin zone , respectively , @xmath18 are the usual pauli matrices , @xmath19 m / s is the fermi velocity of the dirac fermions ( with up and down spin values being represented by @xmath20 , respectively ) and @xmath21 is the band gap induced by intrinsic spin - orbit interaction , which provides a mass to the dirac fermions . the spin - orbit energy gap induced by intrinsic spin - orbit coupling has been estimated ( using density functional theory and tight - binding calculations @xcite ) as @xmath22 mev , and we will consider @xmath23 mev along this paper .",

    "indeed , in figure [ wcortes ] we plot entropy for magnetic field @xmath85 ( thick lines ) and @xmath84 t ( thin lines ) and note that entropy slopes at @xmath107 decrease with @xmath11 but they have a common critical entropy . for electrons ( holes ) , minimum ( maximum ) entropies for a given landau level @xmath94 are attained at asymptotic values @xmath108 , and maximum ( minimum ) entropies are attained at @xmath109 .",
    "the minimum and maximum entropies turn out to depend only on @xmath110 as @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the usual gamma function .",
    "note that @xmath113 , as can also be seen in figure [ wcortes ] .",
    "for example , @xmath114 ( which means that the hamiltonian eigenstate @xmath115 is a coherent state of electrons for @xmath108 and a coherent state of holes for @xmath116 ) and @xmath117 ( which means that @xmath115 is a `` cat state '' of electrons for @xmath116 and a cat state of holes for @xmath108 ) . indeed ,",
    "as commented after , the minimum entropy of @xmath74 is attained for coherent states .",
    "the so - called `` cat states '' arise in many models undergoing a qpt ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and are a superposition of two coherent ( semiclassical ) states with negligible overlap , so that their entropy is twice the minimum entropy , that is , @xmath118 .",
    "in figure [ renyi1 ] we plot the case @xmath97 for higher magnetic fields ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 t in panel a ) and the combined entropy of electrons plus holes , @xmath100 ( in panel b ) , which exhibits a maximum of @xmath102 at the cnps . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the maximum entropy of the electron - hole compound is @xmath119 ( see figure [ renyi1 ] , panel b ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the maximum combined entropy for large @xmath94 is @xmath120 , which shows an increasing logarithmic behavior with @xmath110 .",
    "the existence of a maximum electron plus hole entropy means that the combined wave function spreads across the phase space , taking up a bigger volume ( it is more delocalized ) at the cnp . in figure [ renyi3 ]",
    "we also plot the combined renormalized entropy @xmath121 of particles plus holes for @xmath101 ( solid lines ) and @xmath122 ( dashed lines ) together .",
    "we see that entropy `` hats '' become flatter and flatter as @xmath94 increases .     renormalized rnyi - wehrl entropies of the electron - hole compound for a hamiltonian eigenstate @xmath123 as a function of the electric potential @xmath27 ( @xmath99 t ) for the landau levels @xmath101 ( solid lines ) and @xmath122 ( dashed lines ) , and valley @xmath15 .",
    "black and red curves correspond to spin @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "vertical blue lines indicate the cnps.,width=302 ]    the global behavior of the entropies @xmath124 , as a function of the electric field strength , exhibits some common features with the band inversion behavior for the @xmath43 landau level ( see fig .",
    "[ energias ] and comments at the end of section [ hamilsec ] ) .",
    "indeed , defining the renormalized entropy @xmath125 one can see that the quantities @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( for @xmath128 ) have the same sign in the bi phase ( @xmath7 ) , and different sign in the ti phase ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "see e.g. figure [ renyi1 ] for @xmath99 t ( thick lines ) .",
    "therefore , this `` entropy - inversion '' provides a clear characterization of each phase .    additionally , taking into account",
    "that @xmath124 measures the area occupied by the eigenstate @xmath129 in phase space , we can say that , in the bi phase , an spreading ( resp . localization ) effect can be observed in the electrons ( resp . holes ) for @xmath130 and in the holes ( resp .",
    "electrons ) for @xmath131 ; in the ti phase there is a spreading effect in the electrons with spin up and holes with spin down , and a localization in electrons with spin down and holes with spin up .",
    "we observe that the lower the magnetic field strength , the sharper these spreading and localization effects are .",
    "in this work we have shown that the husimi function is an appropriate tool to study topological - band insulator transitions in silicene and other gapped isoestrucural dirac materials with intrinsic spin - orbit coupling as germanene , stantene or pb .",
    "in particular , the rnyi - wehrl entropy of the husimi function of order two ( related to the inverse participation ratio ) has been used to analyze the ti to bi quantum phase transition , showing the critical points of this transition clearly as a crossing / inversion behavior of the electron and hole entropies at the charge neutrality point .",
    "critical and asymptotic values of electron - hole entropies only depend on the landau level @xmath94 , and not on any other physical quantities like : magnetic strength , fermi velocity , electron charge , etc .",
    "therefore , these entropic measures provide a universal characterization of the topological - band insulator qpt , which is shared with other two - dimensional crystals like ge , sn and pb .",
    "we want to emphasize that all the descriptions in terms of rnyi - wehrl entropies that we have presented in this work will be valid in ( isoestructural ) 2d gapped dirac materials with a strong intrinsic spin - orbit interaction .",
    "actually , all the characterizations studied here will apply to ge , sn and pb counterparts .",
    "in fact , all the figures will be valid by simply replacing the value of @xmath0 in each case : @xmath132 mev for germanene , @xmath133 mev for stanene , @xmath134 mev for pb @xcite . moreover , dirac equation ( and modifications )",
    "provides an effective model for a large family of topological insulators , and an entropic description like the one done in this letter could also sheed new light on the better understanding of topological phases in these physical systems .",
