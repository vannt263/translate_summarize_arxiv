    "ga@xmath0(se@xmath1te@xmath6)@xmath4 semiconductors belong to a class of iii - vi materials that exhibit a cubic zincblende crystal structure ( f43__m _ _ space group ) dominated by stoichiometric or `` structural '' vacancies .",
    "these structural defects arise due to the inherent valence mismatch between the anion and cation forcing 1/3 of the cation sites to be vacant .",
    "previous investigations have posited that the presence of such stoichiometric defects in these classes of materials can greatly influence their material properties .",
    "studies on the electrical properties of these class of materials show a rapid increase in charge carrier mobility as a function of temperature .",
    "for instance , a maximum hall mobility of 210 @xmath7/vs at @xmath8 for p - type in@xmath0te@xmath4 has been measured @xcite .",
    "similar behavior has been seen in p - type ga@xmath0se@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "diffraction and electron microscopy studies on ga@xmath0te@xmath4 have revealed an ordered - vacancy orthorhombic superlattice in addition to the nominal disordered zinc blend structure @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction studies on ga@xmath0se@xmath4 have shown the presence of a monoclinic phase with zigzag ordered vacancies @xcite",
    ". theoretical work on the lattice dynamics of ordered defect zincblende structures suggests that the presence of ordered vacancies does not strongly affect crystal lattice vibrational modes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the precise role that ordered structural vacancies have on material electrical properties remains uncertain .    from a purely structural perspective ,",
    "iii - vi defect zincblende semiconductors display anomalously high radiation stability .",
    "single crystal and polycrystalline specimens of in@xmath0te@xmath4 , ga@xmath0te@xmath4 , and ga@xmath0se@xmath4 were exposed to a flux of 1.2 mev @xmath9-quanta up to a dose of 3 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 , a flux of fast electrons ( with energies up 100 mev ) up to a dose of 3 @xmath10 10@xmath13 m@xmath12 , and a flux of mixed @xmath9-neutron radiation from stationary and pulsed nuclear reactors up to a dose of 10@xmath13 m@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "parameters such as charge carrier concentration , charge carrier mobility , and microhardness measured before and after irradiation show little or no change @xcite .",
    "such observations can be explained by the presence of structural vacancies which minimize frenkel pair production from incident radiation ( as opposed to elemental and iii - v cubic semiconductors with no fractional cation occupancies ) @xcite . as a result",
    ", these class of materials may be applicable for nuclear particle detection or for semiconductor devices operating in high radiation environments .",
    "the aim of this work is to evaluate the potential of defect zincblende iii - vi semiconductors for room - temperature @xmath9-ray spectroscopy applications and investigate the effects of their intrinsic microstructural material properties on device performance ( where the main requirement for semiconductor radiation detectors is large @xmath14@xmath15 values ) .",
    "ga@xmath0te@xmath4 is taken as a starting point , since it lacks the high to low temperature phase transitions observed in in@xmath0te@xmath4 and ga@xmath0se@xmath4 which can make large single crystal growth difficult @xcite .",
    "a band gap of 1.1 ev and an electron mobility of 28 @xmath7/vs at @xmath16 for ga@xmath0te@xmath4 have been reported @xcite .",
    "selenium is then alloyed to the binary compound to produce the ternary ga@xmath0(se@xmath1te@xmath6)@xmath4 system in an effort to engineer the band gap for room - temperature radiation detector applications and to study the effect of selenium addition on the material properties .",
    "this paper presents initial structure and defect investigations for this class of material .",
    "ga@xmath0(se@xmath1te@xmath6)@xmath4 compounds were synthesized using stoichiometric amounts of 8n gallium , 6n selenium , and 6n tellurium sealed in quartz crucibles ( 1.3 cm in diameter ) under vacuum ( 10@xmath17 to 10@xmath18 torr ) .",
    "the quartz crucible was placed on an incline ( to allow for good mixing ) in an alumina boat , and the boat was placed in a 20 cm horizontal tube furnace .",
    "figure 1__a _ _ shows a schematic of the setup in the furnace .",
    "a synthesis temperature of @xmath19 was used , where the measured profile showed a gradual rise in temperature going from the left to the right of the furnace .",
    "specifically , temperatures of @xmath20 at the left end , @xmath21 in the middle , and @xmath22 at the right end were measured .",
    "the stoichiometric amounts of gallium , selenium , and tellurium were allowed to react for 36 h , then the system was cooled directionally at a rate of @xmath23/min in an attempt to grow small single crystals .",
    "resulting ingots were composed of small single crystals mixed in a polycrystalline mass of the same composition .",
    "the single crystal were harvested ( figure 1__b _ _ ) and the polycrystalline mass was used as the charge for vertical bridgman growth ( figure 2__a _ _ ) . for the vertical growth , a quartz crucible ( 1.3 cm in diameter )",
    "was placed in the @xmath5@xmath24 region of the furnace , where it was then translated at a rate of 0.2 mm / h through a temperature gradient of @xmath25/cm .",
    "figure 2__b _ _ shows single crystal grains for a ga@xmath0(se@xmath26te@xmath27)@xmath4 specimen obtained from the growth .",
    "it is important to note that an immiscibility gap in the range of selenium fractions 0.5@xmath28__x__@xmath280.9 has been observed , thus limiting ga@xmath0(se@xmath1te@xmath6)@xmath4 to the tellurium rich condition .",

    "high resolution electron microscopy images of ga@xmath0te@xmath4 have shown the presence of vacancy planes along the [ 111 ] direction occurring periodically at 3.5 nm intervals@xcite .",
    "examining the two pairs of satellite peaks in the ga@xmath0(se@xmath31te@xmath32)@xmath4 diffraction pattern , the intensities of the peaks on opposites sides of the ( 111 ) bragg line are not commensurate with each other .",
    "this seems indicative of only short range ordering due to presence of a distortion possibly arising from the shared nature of the anion ( te / se ) site in the ternary ga@xmath0(se@xmath1te@xmath6)@xmath4 system .",

    "the specific details of carrying out such measurements have been previously reported @xcite .",
    "a @xmath11na source is used to inject positrons into the sample .",
    "lifetime measurements involve a coincidence setup of two baf@xmath0 detectors to measure the time difference between the 1.27 mev de - excitation gamma ray coming from the @xmath11na source , and the 511 kev gamma ray originating from positron annihilation in the sample .",
    "coincidence doppler broadening measurements observe the red / blue shifts of the annihilation photons using ge detectors ; with this information the electron momentum can then be probed via energy and momentum conservation .",
    "figure 4 shows the average positron lifetime ( computed by fitting a two component lifetime model to the experimental positron decay spectrum ) as a function of selenium atomic fraction for four ga@xmath0(se@xmath1te@xmath6)@xmath4 samples .",
    "positrons in all of the samples had an average lifetime of @xmath5350 to 400 ps , indicative of a strong presence of defects ( bulk annihilation lifetime for common semiconductors is on the order of @xmath5200 ps @xcite ) .",
    "this is also evinced by the observation that all of the samples had a dominant second lifetime component ( nominally associated with defects ) , with the exception of the sample with _ x _",
    "= 0.3 which had a fairly large 347 ps first lifetime component ( possibly related to a highly prominent defect ) .",

    "large intensities of low electron momenta ( 0 to @xmath50.03__m__@xmath36_c _ ) are observed ( _ _ m__@xmath36 is the electron rest mass and _ c _ is the speed of light ) ; after @xmath50.03__m__@xmath36_c _ electron momentum intensities drop .",
    "a similar trend is observed when the data are normalized relative to elemental gallium and selenium .",
    "such behavior suggests that positrons are not annihilating at single gallium , tellurium , or selenium vacancies , but at large open - volume defects such as vacancy clusters or voids where the overall electron density is low and low - momentum valence electrons dominate .",
