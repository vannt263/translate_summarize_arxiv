    "now , let us examine properties of @xmath201 at rational angles . at first , @xmath201 vanishes whenever side length of a square window is an integer multiple of @xmath188 , i.e. , @xmath202 .",
    "this arises because under this condition , the lengths of the square along the principal axes of the lattice are integers , and thus the number of lattice points inside the window does not change while translating the window . figure [ fig:1/100 graph ] clearly demonstrates that @xmath203 vanishes at every @xmath204 for an integer @xmath59 . secondly , @xmath201 grows like the window area , @xmath148 .",

    "correlated_. specifically , for a square window , a single line of lattice points near the boundary of the window can fall alternately in and out of the window as the window moves around the lattice with a fixed orientation ( see figure [ fig : illust_directspace](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "0.325    0.325    0.325    thus , the resulting number variance is proportional to the square of the window perimeter in large-@xmath2 limit , i.e. , @xmath211 roughly speaking , if the window surface ( perimeter if @xmath7 ) has higher curvature on average or is closer to the spherical ( circular ) shape , then density fluctuations on the window surface are less correlated so that the growth rate of the variance becomes slower , as shown in figure [ fig : nv_superdisk_new](b ) . essentially , such correlations of density fluctuations on the window surface can be demonstrated in the form of  resonance \" between @xmath144 and @xmath21 in the fourier space , as shown in figure [ fig : fourierspace interpretations ] ( a ) .",

    "<S> we conclude that the orientationally - averaged variance @xmath9 , instead of the conventional one using windows with a fixed orientation , can be used to resolve the window - shape dependence on the direct - space hyperuniformity condition . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a new direct - space hyperuniformity condition that is valid for any convex window . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis on the window orientations demonstrates an example of physical systems exhibiting commensurate - incommensurate transitions and is closely related to problems in number theory ( e.g. , diophantine approximation and gauss circle problem ) and discrepancy theory .    </S>",
