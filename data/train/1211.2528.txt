    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of a small long - range interacting system , in contact with a large long - range thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals the existence of striking anomalies in the energy flux between the bath and the system . in particular </S>",

    "<S> the system may get hotter also when its initial temperature is larger than the bath temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is explained quantitatively in the framework of the collisionless vlasov description of dynamics and shown to be universally valid whenever the vlasov picture applies , from cosmology to plasma physics .    in the recent past </S>",
    "<S> , several theoretical and experimental studies have been devoted to exploring dynamical and thermodynamic properties of long - range interacting systems ( lris s )  @xcite . in such systems </S>",
    "<S> , energy is not additive . </S>",
    "<S> this fact , together with a possible break of ergodicity , is at the origin of a large gallery of peculiar thermodynamic behaviors : the specific heat of lris s can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble  @xcite and temperature jumps may appear at microcanonical first - order phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these systems also display remarkable non - equilibrium dynamical features . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is well known that under particular conditions isolated lris s may get trapped in long - lasting quasi - stationary states ( qss s ) , whose lifetime diverges with system size  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , when performing the limit @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the number of particles ) , the system remains permanently confined in qss s  @xcite . as a consequence , for large long - range interacting systems , </S>",
    "<S> qss s are directly accessible through experiment  @xcite . + until today , the large majority of studies aimed at elucidating the fundamental properties of lris s have been carried out on isolated systems , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ under the assumption that the system properties are not influenced by the external environment . </S>",
    "<S> however , recognizing whether a non - equilibrium qss is stable to an external perturbation is of great importance  @xcite , both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view . </S>",
    "<S> a related fundamental problem concerns the mechanism through which a lris exchanges energy with the surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> these questions epitomize the main motivation of the present work . </S>",
    "<S> + the non - equilibrium dynamical properties of the lris s in contact with a thermal bath have been studied for the first time only recently  @xcite . as a possible realization of thermal bath </S>",
    "<S> , these authors considered a large hamiltonian system with nearest - neighbor interactions , coupled to a fraction of the spins in the system . </S>",
    "<S> they concluded that the coupling with the bath introduces a new time scale in the evolution of the system : the weaker the coupling strength , the longer the system remains trapped in a qss before relaxing to equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> + at variance with the above studies , we investigate here the dynamics of a lris in long - range contact with an additional large system trapped in a qss . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction scheme can be regarded as a more clear - sighted realization of a _ thermal bath _ for a lris , opening the way to applications in diverse fields such as cosmology and plasma physics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one may think of the collision - less mixing between plasmas , or the operation of magnetic fusion devices for energy production or the merging of globular clusters to a self - gravitating galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is also tempting to speculate that our simple scheme could be somehow relevant for the self - consistent interaction between dark ( the bath ) and baryonic ( the system ) matter in the universe ( see , _ </S>",

    "<S> the system displays non - gaussian velocity distributions and it takes values of @xmath6 different than those predicted by equilibrium thermodynamics  @xcite . + rigorous mathematical results  @xcite indicate that in the limit @xmath0 the discrete hmf dynamics reduces to the continuum vlasov equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the microscopic one - particle distribution function , @xmath10=-m_x[f]\\cos(\\theta)-m_y[f]\\sin(\\theta)$ ] , @xmath11=\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } f(\\theta , p , t)\\cos\\theta \\ , d\\theta \\ , dp$ ] and @xmath12=\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } f(\\theta , p , </S>",

    "<S> the vlasov equation defines the natural framework to address the puzzle of qss s emergence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , qss s are connected to the stable stationary solutions of the vlasov equation . </S>",
    "<S> this observation suggests a statistical mechanics approach , inspired by the seminal work of lynden - bell  @xcite , to characterize analytically the qss properties . </S>",
    "<S> lynden - bell s approach is based on the definition of a locally - averaged ( `` coarse - grained '' ) distribution , yielding an entropy functional defined from first - principle statistical - mechanics prescriptions . by constrained maximization of such an entropy , </S>",

    "<S> , the qsss can be equally interpreted as equilibrium configurations of the corresponding continuous description  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the qss thermal bath that we consider here corresponds to a magnetized equilibrium solution of the underlying vlasov equation  . </S>",
    "<S> + let @xmath14 be the normalized single - particle distribution that characterizes the qss bath . such a function is obtained as the stationary solution of the vlasov equation   corresponding to a water - bag initial distribution , @xmath15 $ ] for @xmath16 , p\\in[-\\delta p_{b},\\delta p_{b}]$ ] and zero elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> note that the initial magnetization of the bath @xmath17 and its energy density @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn implies that the initial water - bag profile is uniquely determined by @xmath17 and @xmath23 , in agreement with the lynden - bell theory  . </S>",
    "<S> + at this point , @xmath24 in our discussion , another hmf system with water - bag profile is injected and let evolve consistently with the bath . </S>",
    "<S> this system , @xmath25 in the following , is described in terms of its associated single - particle distribution @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the bath should be significantly larger than the system to which it is coupled . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished through the following normalization condition @xmath27 where @xmath28 sets the relative size of the two mutually interacting @xmath25 and @xmath29 hmf systems . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in tracking the time evolution of the distribution @xmath30 under the constraint  . from the physical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , we are reproducing the microcanonical dynamics of one isolated hmf system ( @xmath31 ) , composed of two sub - systems supposed as distinguishable : the larger subsystem ( the bath @xmath29 ) has already relaxed to its qss equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the system @xmath25 is initially confined in an out - of - equilibrium configuration of the water - bag type . to monitor the evolution of both subsystems , </S>",
    "<S> we follow the kinetic temperatures @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and the corresponding magnetizations @xmath34 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 and @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> . a typical time evolution of these observables , obtained by numerical integration of the vlasov equation  , is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] ( see also supplementary material ) . after a short transient </S>",
    "<S> , the system reaches a quasi - equilibrium state where the mean value of the kinetic temperature is _ different _ from the temperature of the bath . in other words , the bath and the systems </S>",
    "<S> do not thermalize . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the two magnetizations converge to different values . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we note that the specific values of temperature and magnetization attained by the system spotlight a non - trivial interaction with the bath . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are indeed substantially different from the values that the system would reach when evolved microcanonically from the same initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain equivalent results upon simulating the discrete @xmath1-body dynamics  . in this case , after a transient that gets progressively longer as the system size @xmath39 is increased , @xmath40 and @xmath41 tend to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , granularity causes thermalization , which is instead prevented in the continuum ( vlasov ) limit . </S>",
    "<S> we term _ canonical qss s _ the quasi - equilibrium configurations that the system explores when in long - range contact with a qss thermal bath in the zero energy - flux regime . +    in the continuum limit , when the system is trapped in a canonical qss , we find that the average energy flux between the bath and the system indeed vanishes , making the two subsystems by all means decoupled and thus preventing thermalization ( see supplementary material a for a more detailed analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that a zero - flux steady state is reached for @xmath42 in the non - collisional continuum limit , at variance with what is normally found in most collisional systems . </S>",
    "<S> + even more surprising is the behavior of the system during the `` violent relaxation '' stage towards the canonical qss , which is characterized by a net energy flux from the ( cold ) bath to the ( hot ) system . to better illustrate this observation , we plot @xmath43 and @xmath37 versus time in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] . note that @xmath37 is larger than @xmath43 at @xmath24 , the time of injection . </S>",
    "<S> as time progresses , the difference @xmath44 increases even further , resulting in an anomalous energy transfer from the bath to the system . in short , and counter - intuitively , </S>",
    "<S> the _ hot _ system gets _ </S>",
    "<S> hotter _ when placed in contact with a large long - range qss reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> this observation , although fighting intuition , does not violate any laws of physics , as the second law of thermodynamics is only expected to hold at thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> +    once the system has settled down in its canonical qss at zero average energy flux , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are found to be different from zero . in order to pinpoint the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a series of simulations for the same bath conditions as specified in the caption of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] , and varying the initial energy of the system @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> different energies lead to distinct canonical qss s , as it happens to isolated systems trapped in microcanonical qss s . at first glance , </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to speculate that canonical qss s might originate from a net balance of two opposing thermodynamic forces , presumably related to @xmath44 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the dynamical evolution of @xmath25 is _ not _ influenced by the temperature of the bath @xmath43 , at least for @xmath28 , but only responds to its magnetization @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , provided @xmath46 is kept fixed , @xmath43 can be set to an arbitrary value , without significantly altering the system dynamics . this is illustrated by the data collapse reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4 ] . + this striking observation is unintuitive as compared to the case of short - range systems . </S>",
    "<S> even more interestingly , it is by no means restricted to the hmf . in order to illustrate this fact </S>",
    "<S> , we note that in the vlasov limit the distribution functions @xmath47 @xmath48 obey to @xmath49\\frac{\\de f_{\\alpha}}{\\de p}=0 \\label{eq : sysbath - ev}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a generic mean - field potential ( the prime defining ordinary differentiation with respect to @xmath51 ) , defined as @xmath52= \\int f(\\theta',p',t)v(\\theta-\\theta ' ) \\ , d \\theta'dp',\\ ] ] @xmath53 being the two - body potential . </S>",
    "<S> since the system / bath relative size @xmath28 , we can treat it as a perturbative parameter , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> expanding eqs .   and </S>",
    "<S> keeping only terms that cause changes @xmath56 in the physical observables , we are led to the two following coupled equations @xmath57\\frac{\\de </S>",
    "<S> f_{\\alpha}}{\\de p}=0 \\qquad \\alpha = b , s.\\ ] ] the equation for the bath implies that this is frozen in its initial configuration , a stable equilibrium of the vlasov equation , @xmath58 at all times  . </S>",
    "<S> the equation for @xmath59 is the liouville equation for a distribution of uncoupled particles moving in an external potential , @xmath60 being constant . </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions are utterly general and should apply to any physical system whose density is governed by the vlasov equation . for the hmf model , thanks to its rotational invariance , one has with no loss of generality @xmath61 which is simply the liouville equation for a set of uncoupled pendula . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the leading - order evolution of @xmath59 depends _ only _ on @xmath62 and _ not _ on @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath62 sets the width of the resonance of the pendulum along @xmath63 , which scales as @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the temperature should be proportional to @xmath46 , as can be also appreciated by dividing eq .   in the stationary state by @xmath65 . +    consistently with the above scaling arguments , we plot in fig .  [ figure4 ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 as a function of the rescaled width of the initial water - bag @xmath67 , for different values of the bath magnetization and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the data refer to direct integration of the ( constrained ) vlasov equations   and of eqs .  . </S>",
    "<S> in all cases , the data collapse nicely on a single master curve , which confirms the validity of our reasoning . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical calculation of @xmath66 for @xmath68 yields @xmath69 , in excellent agreement with the result of direct integration of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( see supplementary material b and also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset further shows that @xmath1-body simulations agree with all results obtained in the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> + summarizing , we have proposed an implementation of long - range qss bath . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that a small system in _ true _ long - range contact with a large , long - range reservoir reaches a zero - flux steady state , that we term _ canonical _ quasi - stationary state . </S>",
    "<S> these are stationary states of the system - bath coupled vlasov equations , but quasi - stationary solutions of the associated @xmath1-body problem . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in the explored range of parameters , we find that hotter - than - bath systems become hotter in canonical qss s . in the contest of the hmf model , based on simple scaling arguments , we have unveiled how the system anomalously increases its temperature as the fraction of its particles trapped in the resonance set by the bath magnetization gain energy . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy gain is proportional to the value of @xmath46 and independent of the bath temperature at the leading order in @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we argue that the results illustrated in this paper should be general and extend beyond the hmf case - study , whenever the collision - less vlasov picture is a good description of the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results might open the unexpected possibility of extracting energy from a cold reservoir through long - range coupling . </S>",
