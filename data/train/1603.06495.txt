    "in recent years , topologically nontrivial properties of band theory in electronic systems have become the driving force in condensed matter physics @xcite . although electronic band theory has been studied over the past decades , the topological properties associated with it have only been appreciated recently .",
    "the haldane model @xcite was the first example of quantum anomalous hall effect ( zero magnetic field quantum hall effect ) in electronic systems that originates completely from the topology of the energy bands . for many decades ,",
    "this model was deemed as a toy model due to lack of experimental evidence .",
    "quite recently , the experimental realization of haldane model @xcite has been reported in ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically modulated optical honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "this observation has motivated numerous theoretical studies of the effects of interactions in the so - called haldane - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , topologically nontrivial energy bands occur frequently in ordered quantum spin magnets , however , their topological properties are rarely studied in quantum magnetism .",
    "the study of topological spin excitations ( magnons ) recently began with the work of katsura - nagaosa - lee @xcite on the kagome and pyrochlore heisenberg ferromagnets with a nearest - neighbour ( nn ) dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite .",
    "in addition to breaking the inversion symmetry of the lattice , the dm interaction plays the role of spin - orbit coupling as in electronic systems . as a result ,",
    "the bosons acquire a phase ( magnetic flux ) while hopping on the lattice and the system exhibits similar topological properties as in electronic systems .",
    "however , in bosonic systems there is no fermi energy or fermi level , and the idea of completely filled band does not apply . in this respect , the chern number characterizing the nontrivial topology of the energy bands is , in fact , independent of the statistical nature of the particles .",
    "it merely predicts counter - propagating edge state modes in the vicinity of the bulk gap as a result of the bulk - edge correspondence .",
    "this leads to magnon edge state modes in ordered quantum magnets .",
    "interestingly , the magnon edge state modes carry a transverse heat ( spin ) current upon the application of a longitudinal temperature gradient .",
    "as magnons are uncharged particles , there is no lorentz force , the dm interaction plays the role of a magnetic field by altering the propagation of the magnon in the system , thus leads to thermal hall effect dubbed _ magnon hall effect_. it was discovered experimentally by onose _",
    "et al_. , @xcite in the ferromagnetic insulator lu@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 with a 3d pyrochlore lattice structure .",
    "recently , thermal hall effect has been observed experimentally on the 2d kagome magnet cu(1 - 3 , bdc ) @xcite . besides , _ phonon hall effect _ had been observed previously @xcite in a completely different scenario .",
    "mathematically , _",
    "magnon hall effect _ is manifested as a result of the nontrivial topology of magnon bulk band encoded in the berry curvature @xmath3 , which acts a magnetic field , where @xmath4 is a vector potential .",
    "this result was derived by matsumoto and murakami @xcite and relates the transverse thermal conductivity @xmath5 directly to the berry curvature of the magnon bulk bands reminiscent of hall conductivity in electronic systems @xcite .",
    "it simply shows that the dm interaction can appear in any form provided the system exhibits a nontrivial topology in the magnon bulk bands .",
    "it was also shown that due to the boson population of the bands at high and low temperatures , thermal conductivity changes sign as function of temperature or magnetic field on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices @xcite .",
    "in addition , spin nernst and torque effects have been recently proposed theoretically in these systems @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg ferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice is known to exhibit dirac points in the magnon energy bands @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "we have proposed and studied a topological magnon insulator on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "we observed many distinctive features on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "firstly , the dm interaction appears as a next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) coupling transversing through the triangular plaquettes of the nnn sites on the honeycomb lattice as opposed to the kagome and pyrocholre lattices .",
    "it generates a spin chirality on the triangular plaquettes of the nnn sites given by @xmath6 on sublattice @xmath7 and @xmath8 on sublattice @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spin at site @xmath11 . in the spin wave bosonic representation ,",
    "the resulting hamiltonian @xcite is analogous to the haldane model in electronic systems @xcite , which is known to possess a nontrivial insulating phase .",
    "secondly , thermal hall conductivity @xmath12 does not change sign as a function of temperature or magnetic field and the low temperature dependence follows a @xmath13 law @xcite .",
    "recently , spin nernst effect has been studied in this system @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the topological properties of magnons are not different from those of hardcore boson systems .",
    "this is due to a one - to - one correspondence between bosonic systems and quantum magnetic systems .",
    "we study a haldane - like hardcore bosons on the honeycomb lattice , which possesses a superfluid phase and a mott phase .",
    "this model has a quantum monte carlo sign problem which hinders an explicit numerical simulation using this method .",
    "however , it can be studied by other available numerical schemes .",
    "we utilize the magnetic spin analogue of this model by mapping it to a quantum xy model with a dm interaction .",
    "this enables us to study the magnetic excitations ( magnons ) of the quantum system .",
    "we observe nontrivial topological properties of this model by studying the magnon energy bands , edge states , berry curvature , thermal and spin nernst conductivities of the corresponding quantum spin model of the hardcore bosons .",
    "the correspondence between hardcore bosons and quantum spin systems suggests that the associated hardcore boson model exhibits the same properties in the boson language , because its excitations have to be magnons as well .",
    "these results are important as they can be studied in cold atom experiments .",
    "in fact , the phase transitions between superfluid phase and mott phase have been reported experimentally in ultracold bosonic atom experiments in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible to realize magnon topological properties by using cold atoms trapped in honeycomb optical lattices as has been reported in fermionic systems @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the shortcoming of most topological bosonic models is that quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation is not applicable due to a deliberating sign problem . in this paper , we study one of these models in which qmc suffers a sign problem . for hardcore bosons on the honeycomb lattice without any topological effects ,",
    "qmc has been utilized effectively in the study of the ground state phase diagrams @xcite . in this system",
    "there is a u(1 ) invariance , hence the bosonic excitations ( magnons ) always exhibit a gapless ( goldstone ) mode at the @xmath14 points ( @xmath15 ) and the two magnon bands exhibit dirac points at the corners of the brillouin zone @xmath16 .",
    "such 2d systems with dirac nodes have no topological effects in the excitation spectrum .",
    "the topological properties of these systems have received no attention mostly for the reason mentioned above .",
    "fortunately , the hardcore boson hamiltonian has a one - to - one correspondence to a spin-@xmath0 quantum xxz or xy model @xcite .",
    "hence , the topological effects in this model can be studied in terms of the magnetic excitations of the quantum spin model . as in many electronic systems ,",
    "topological effects arise when a gap opens at @xmath17 .",
    "there are many different ways to open a gap at @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest way is to add a staggered on - site potential , as has been shown recently @xcite . in the magnetic spin language , this corresponds to a staggered magnetic field .",
    "an alternative way is to add a haldane - like imaginary hopping interaction along the nnn sites , this would correspond to a dm interaction in the spin language @xcite .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian of a gapped hardcore boson model on the honeycomb lattice can be written as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators respectively ; @xmath21 ; @xmath22 depending on the hopping directions of the bosons as shown in fig .",

    "however , topological effects should also arise in noninteracting hardcore bosons [ hardcore ] .",
    "in contrast to haldane model in fermionic systems @xcite , the hardcore bosons [ hardcore ] can be mapped to a spin-@xmath0 quantum spin system @xcite . in the spin language , eq .",
    "[ hardcore ] maps to @xmath33 where @xmath34 ; @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",

    "it is important to note that the spin hamiltonian [ hh1 ] is unfrustrated in all the parameter regimes .",

    "it is well - known that topologically nontrivial properties of magnon excitations such as magnon edge states , thermal hall effect , and spin nernst effect , can be understood entirely by semiclassical approximations @xcite .",
    "spin wave theory provides the simplest way to study the topological effects in ordered quantum magnetic systems . in this section",
    ", we apply this formalism to the present model .",
    "the mean field phase diagram provides the possible phases in the system . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the spins can be approximated as classical vectors parameterized by a unit vector : @xmath44 .",
    "there are two sublattices on the honeycomb lattice as shown in fig .",
    "the classical energy with @xmath45 ( coplanar spins ) is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of unit cells , @xmath48 is the critical field , and @xmath49 is the coordination number of the lattice . at the mean - field level , the dm interaction does not contribute to the classical energy .",
    "the filling factor is given by @xmath50 .",
    "in this model , there are only two possible phases  a canted ferromagnet or superfluid at small magnetic field and a fully polarized ferromagnet or mott phase , with the spins eqnarrayed along the @xmath51-axis at large magnetic field . in both ferromagnets @xmath52 . the filling factor for the mott phases are @xmath53 ( empty ) and @xmath54 ( full ) for @xmath55 respectively .",

    "<S> this paper presents a connection between the topological properties of hardcore bosons and that of magnons in quantum spin magnets . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize the haldane - like hardcore bosons on the honeycomb lattice as an example . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this system maps to a spin-@xmath0 quantum xy model with a next - nearest - neighbour dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the magnon excitations of the quantum spin model and compute the edge states , berry curvature , thermal and spin nernst conductivities . due to the mapping from spin variables to bosons , </S>",
    "<S> the hardcore bosons possess the same nontrivial topological properties as those in quantum spin system . </S>",
    "<S> these results are important in the study of magnetic excitations in quantum magnets and they are also useful for understanding the control of ultracold bosonic quantum gases in honeycomb optical lattices , which is experimentally accessible . </S>"
