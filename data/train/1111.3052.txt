    "vibrationally resolved electronic spectra ( _ e.g. _ one - photon absorption and emission spectra ) are within the born - oppenheimer framework usually interpreted in terms of franck - condon ( fc ) factors ( fcfs ) @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one can try to obtain the shape of the spectral profile for a fc - allowed transition from computed fcfs in frequency domain .",
    "however , the evaluation of fcfs for large molecular systems is challenging even within the harmonic approximation if one has to take duschinsky mode mixing ( rotation )  @xcite into account .",
    "this is because multi - variate hermite polynomials have then to be evaluated for each fc integral , rather than only uni - variate hermite polynomials as is the case for the comparatively simple parallel harmonic oscillator model .",
    "the computational task becomes more difficult as the molecular size and temperature increases because the number of fc integrals grows vastly . to describe fc - forbidden or weakly allowed transitions ,",
    "one has to go beyond the condon approximation and employ for instance a herzberg - teller ( ht ) expansion  @xcite of the electronic transition moment with respect to the normal coordinates . as a result ,",
    "the calculation of the vibronic spectrum for a non - condon process is even more difficult than for a fc - allowed transition because one has to evaluate many matrix elements of the non - condon operators which require for each ht integral in general the calculation of combinations of several fc integrals .",
    "the number of fc integrals and matrix elements of non - condon operators to be evaluated in a sum - over - states approach can be significantly reduced with the help of rigorous integral prescreening strategies  @xcite . however , this time - independent ( ti ) calculation of the spectral profile in frequency domain is still considerably more expensive than an alternative time - dependent ( td ) approach that exploits time - correlation functions ( tcfs ) ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but offers the ability to directly assign individual peaks in the spectrum . as we have outlined earlier  @xcite , a unified coherent state - based generating function ( csgf ) approach  @xcite can be used both for rigorous integral prescreening strategies and tcf calculations which combine the strengths of both approaches and complement each other favourably . even in the less demanding td approach , however , one usually has to invest significant computational time for often unnecessary spectral details .",
    "cumulants ( or moments ) of a distribution ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) can deliver highly useful information . from this one can either attempt to reconstruct the spectral shape or try to estimate the relevant spectral profile , which can be exploited in subsequent ti and td approaches  @xcite .",
    "cumulants of the vibronic spectrum can be obtained from the csgf directly without computing the total spectrum in frequency domain .",
    "this method was exploited already in ref .",
    "@xcite for fc - allowed transitions , and we report herein an extension of this method to incorporate non - condon transitions . as application , we present the profile of the @xmath1 transition of benzene , which is in the electric dipole approximation franck - condon forbidden , at various temperatures within the linear ht approximation and compare the cumulant expansion result with the tcf approach .",
    "the spectral profile ( @xmath2 ) can be expressed via the fourier transform ( ft ) of the tcf ( @xmath3 ) that depends on the time @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 , namely @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transition energy and @xmath8 the @xmath9 transition energy .",
    "the corresponding occupancy representation for the tcf can be obtained from fermi s golden rule , _ i.e. _ @xmath10 where we have assumed an electric dipole transition with the electronic transition dipole moment ( @xmath11 ) , which is a function of normal coordinates of the initial electronic state .",

    "the time - dependent part with the vibronic transition energy corresponds to a dirac delta distribution in frequency domain and accordingly this expression is usually evaluated in frequency domain , which is straightforward .",
    "the spatial representation of the tcf in closed form can be found by evaluating the following quantum mechanical traces @xmath21 the traces can be evaluated with any complete basis . in our work coherent states",

    "the vibronic spectral density function can be related to a probability density function ( pdf ) because the vibronic transition process follows a certain pdf .",

    "the tcf - fft curves still show vibrational structure and the ce - edgeworth curves ( solid lines ) look like nonlinear regression curves of the corresponding tcf - fft spectra .",

    "the two methods agree well and for higher orders still the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "one of the advantages of the numerical method is that one only needs to compute the tcf for the first few time steps .",
    "the analytical method usually meets a combinatorial problem in high order cumulant calculations due to the analytic derivatives of the inverse matrix .",
    "the second advantage is that it is easy to include linear and nonlinear non - condon effects .",
    "the third advantage is that one can incorporate general line shape functions which would not have well defined cumulants ( see the discussion on page 415 of ref .",

    "this can be rationalised as follows : because the duschinsky mode mixing between low and high frequency modes is small in the present case , the high frequency modes can not obtain thermal energy from the low frequency modes efficiently .",
    "thus the high frequency modes are almost thermally inactive , whereas the total intensity ( @xmath66 ) increases as temperature increases . in the mean energy calculation of the high frequency modes at finite temperatures",
    "the denominator ( total intensity ) increases because low frequency modes accept thermal energy while the numerator ( excitation of high frequency modes ) stays constant .",
    "therefore the mean excitation energies of high frequency modes are reduced at finite temperatures . if duschinsky rotation couples the low and high frequency modes significantly ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however , thermal energy can be transfered to the high frequency modes via the low frequency modes in the initial state , accordingly the mean excitation energies of high frequency modes can increase as temperature increases .",
    "we have discussed a cumulant expansion method for describing non - condon transitions and applied it to the prototypical one - photon electric dipole @xmath0 transition of benzene , which is fc forbidden but ht allowed in the linear ht approximation .",
    "the method is particularly powerful when one does not require all the details of the vibronic structures , but rather only quantities such as peak maximum , mean and variance of the spectral shape .",
    "this method is computationally much cheaper than the sum - over - states and time - correlation function approach .",
    "moreover , the information ( _ e.g. _ relevant energy window ) from the cumulant expansion method can be used in the calculation within the other two methods .",
    "herein we compared a numerical approach for the calculation of cumulants with the results from an analytical scheme .",
