    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) remain the most practical and well - exploited cosmological probe offering an immediate route to understanding ` dark energy '",
    ". measures of distant events are being used to distinguish between einstein s cosmological constant , @xmath2 , and a scalar field whose equation of state parameter @xmath3@xmath4 @xcite . yet despite remarkable observational progress , there is no satisfactory theory explaining a sn ia event .",
    "the mechanism by which a white dwarf accretes additional material is unclear as is the nature of the explosion itself @xcite .    to facilitate progress ,",
    "observers employ a variety of empirical correlations to reduce the intrinsic scatter of the sn ia hubble diagram .",
    "sne ia were initially considered a one or two parameter family with the light curve width and rest - frame color as the key variables .",
    "however improved data have revealed important correlations with the host galaxy .",
    "events are not only more common in star - forming hosts per unit stellar mass but their light curve properties differ from those seen in quiescent galaxies @xcite , an effect that has direct consequences for their use over large look - back times @xcite .",
    "these discoveries naturally raise the question of what further evolutionary changes might be present in the sn ia population .",
    "a long - standing concern has been the unknown effect of an _ evolving progenitor composition _ , both in terms of a possible redshift - dependent bias , and in producing an intrinsic dispersion that could limit the effectiveness of large future surveys .",
    "a keck study of high quality rest - frame near - uv sne ia spectra at intermediate redshift ( @xmath5 ) reveals a surprising diversity at short wavelengths where some models predict a sensitivity to metallicity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter e08 , see also foley et al .",
    "a large u - band dispersion had earlier been claimed in the local photometric survey of @xcite , although subsequent photometry has challenged the amount @xcite .",
    "although some models predict a uv dispersion might arise from variations in the progenitor composition @xcite , the magnitude of the effect seen by e08 exceeds that predicted for reasonable compositional differences .",
    "@xcite have shown a large fraction of the uv flux can be formed by reverse - fluorescence scattering which affects the dependence on composition .",
    "if the observed dispersion is found to arise from some evolutionary trend , it could bias future @xmath6 sne campaigns that typically sample from this wavelength region .",
    "* hereafter s09 ) compare mean sn ia spectra over a redshift path of @xmath7 and find no strong evolution , however , only three local uv spectra were available at the time , seriously limiting the comparison and giving no local measure of the uv dispersion .",
    "efforts to understand the uv behavior of sne ia have subsequently intensified .",
    "using the uv optical telescope on - board swift , @xcite and @xcite have confirmed the presence of a dispersion increase to shorter wavelengths in local sne ia .",
    "comparisons between local and intermediate redshift data remain confused and so the question remains as to whether some component of the significant diversity of uv spectra seen in distant sne ia is an evolutionary phenomenon or represents some as yet unexplained diversity in the sn ia mechanism .    as described in e08 ,",
    "spectroscopic studies offer a major advantage over photometric investigations as they eliminate uncertainties arising from k - corrections and , with adequate data , the mean and dispersion can be investigated in the context of known metallic features . following the successful repair of the uv - capable space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( @xmath8 ) during the 2009 servicing mission 4 , it has become possible to make significant progress in addressing the above questions . using a non - disruptive target of opportunity campaign",

    "one event ( sn 2009le ) has no ptf photometry and its phase was determined from the chase estimate @xcite which is consistent with our spectroscopic estimate . in our final analysis (",
    " 3 ) , this imprecision affects the discussion of two of our stis spectra ( 09dnl , 2009le ) .",
    "[ 0.75 ]    prior to hst cycle 13 , uv spectra were secured for 13 local sneia , but only 5 were studied close to maximum light and 2 of these were peculiar .",
    "those suitable from earlier work are listed in table  [ details ] and shown in figure  [ stis_spec ] . in cycle 13",
    "a too campaign began to increase the sample ( go 10182 , pi : filippenko ) but the failure of stis curtailed this program .",
    "remarkably , prior to our study , more was known about the pre - maximum and maximum light uv spectra of sneia at @xmath47 than at @xmath48 .",
    "our stis sample has now dramatically improved this situation .    in order to compare the mean uv spectra of local sneia and their dispersion with the sample discussed by e08",
    ", we must match the phase ( and ideally the stretch ) distributions of the two samples .",
    "such a matched comparison was not possible in s09 due to the paucity of the local data . to maximize the utility of the new hst data ,",
    "we adopt a phase range of @xmath49 to @xmath50d ( figure  [ program ] ) bounded by the earliest phase of the hst data ( @xmath49 ) and a @xmath50d phase limit similar to that applied in e08 to minimize phase evolution effects on the mean and dispersion .",
    "this criterion leads to 11 events from the hst+archival sample drawn from table  [ details ] and 16 events from e08 . ignoring the two events for which accurate stretches can not be determined , the mean values are @xmath51 and @xmath52 which are consistent within the errors .",
    "excluding the two supernovae for which reliable stretches are not available does not significantly affect our results in the following subsections .",
    "s09 presented a comparison of the mean uv spectra determined by e08 at @xmath5 , those secured using the acs grism by @xcite at @xmath53 , and three local spectra from archival data listed in table  [ details ] .",
    "examining the @xmath5 uv spectra , s09 found some decrease with redshift in the strength of intermediate mass element features ( si ii , ca ii , and mg ii ) , but it was argued this could arise in part due to the natural drift to luminous , larger stretch events expected at high redshift . below @xmath54 3600 ",
    "the mean local spectrum was highly uncertain .    to facilitate a proper comparison to s09",
    ", we construct our mean near - uv spectrum following the procedure discussed in e08 .",
    "briefly , the spectra are normalized to have the same flux through a box filter defined between rest - frame @xmath55  and the variation in the mean spectrum is estimated via bootstrap - resampling .",
    "use of other box filters , including the full wavelength range common to all spectra , does not significantly affect the results .",
    "figure  [ best ] shows the normalized mean spectrum and region containing @xmath56% of 100",
    "bootstrap - resampled mean spectra for both the low- and intermediate - redshift matched samples .",
    "although the low redshift sn ia mean spectrum closely resembles that at @xmath5 , as in s09 , we notice a marked decrease with increasing redshift in the depth of the si ii and ca ii blend near 3800  , mg ii near 4300  , and those of iron group elements below @xmath57 .",
    "the utility of the comparison is more advantageous than that conducted by s09 for wavelengths below 3500  since our new local sample is much larger than that used by s09 and the phase and stretch distributions are better matched .",
    "farther into the uv we note that the differences between the mean local and @xmath580.5 spectra become particularly significant .",
    "since the stretch distributions of the two samples are similar , this could be a genuine effect rather than one arising from samples biased to more luminous and bluer events @xcite .",
    "analysis of our eventual full sample will clarify this important point .",
    "[ 0.75 ]      e08 demonstrated a significant increase in the variance of their @xmath580.5 sne ia uv spectra for wavelengths below @xmath59 , both by comparing individual deviations of @xmath60 maximum light spectra from their mean in units of the dispersion @xmath61 , and via photometric colors measured directly from color - corrected keck spectra .",
    "for the first time , our low - redshift sample of uv sn ia spectra is large enough to perform a similar analysis .",
    "ideally one would color- correct the local spectra following the procedure discussed in e08 using the salt2 color law @xcite but this requires host- corrected multi - color data that must await late - time reference images in bands other than the ptf @xmath45-band .",
    "we experimented with estimating the host contamination in @xmath62 and @xmath63 from the contemporary data but concluded the uncertainties are too great at this time .",
    "accordingly , a comparison with data from e08 that is not color - corrected is more appropriate .",
    "it is important to note that the color correction e08 applied did not significantly change the uv scatter and its wavelength dependent trend .",
    "the key question we seek to address is whether the dispersion trend is generic to all sne ia , independent of redshift , or largely a feature _ of the intermediate redshift data only _ , possibly implying some evolutionary effect .",
    "figure  [ disp ] shows that the wavelength - dependent dispersion is indeed present in the local data , consistent with the photometric claims of @xcite and @xcite . in the region that contains 90% of the mean values from bootstrap resampling , the variation from one spectrum to another with respect to the mean increases below @xmath59  as in e08 .",
    "clearly several of the features which vary between the local and e08 samples discussed earlier contribute to the dispersion suggesting a compositional origin .",
    "even if we exclude the region dominated by strong features and consider the average dispersion from the mean spectrum in the regions uv : 2900 - 3500   and optical : 4100 - 5200   allowing for the spectrophotometric uncertainties , we find that the dispersion increases from the optical to the uv by a similar factor of @xmath642.3 in both the local and @xmath580.5 samples .",
    "there is marginal evidence that the uv scatter may be larger in the @xmath580.5 data than in the local sample , but the spectrophotometric uncertainties for the individual spectra are naturally larger .",
    "overall , we conclude that the uv spectral dispersion is most likely a feature of the sne ia population and not an evolutionary effect .",
    "our initial results clarify and quantify indications from earlier work .",
    "although the sn ia mean spectrum close to maximum light appears to have remained remarkably similar over the past 5 gyr , we find the decrease in the strength of the metallic features with increasing redshift noted by s09 also present in our more representative comparison .",
    "given that the mean stretches of the local and z@xmath640.5 samples are similar , this may represent the expected decrease in metallicity over this epoch .",
    "we can address this possibility in more detail with the completion of our survey .",
    "equally important is that we observe a strong wavelength dependent scatter in the rest - frame uv spectra of our local sample , as noted in e08 .",
    "independent of the calibration questions that have plagued recent photometric studies , the spectra demonstrate that the uv scatter is generic to sne ia over a wide range of cosmic time and is not likely an evolutionary effect .",
    "much of this behavior can be attributed to the varying absorption line strengths of intermediate mass elements occupying the uv wavelength region , supporting the notion that the uv scatter arises from compositional differences between events .",
    "in addition to strengthening these conclusions with a larger sample , it is now clear that further progress will follow more detailed multi - phase uv studies of selected local events .",
