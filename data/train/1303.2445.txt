    "[ sec : intro ]    this paper is devoted to the numerical simulation of the process of cellular spatial organization driven by chemotaxis . the effective mechanism by which individual cells undergo directed motion varies among organisms .",
    "here we are particularly interested in bacterial migration , characterized by the smallness of the cells , and their ability to move to several orders of magnitude in the attractant concentration .",
    "several models , depending on the level of description , have been developed mathematically for the collective motion of cells .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review on parabolic , hyperbolic and kinetic models and to @xcite for traveling waves drivn by growth and chemotaxis . among them the kinetic model introduced by othmer , dunbar and alt @xcite , describes a population of bacteria in motion ( for instance the _ e. coli _ ) in interactions with a chemoattractant concentration @xcite .",
    "these cells are so small that they are not able to measure any head - to - tail gradient of the chemical concentration , and to choose directly some preferred direction of motion towards high concentrated regions",
    ". therefore they develop an indirect strategy to select favorable regions , by detecting a sort of time derivative in the concentration along their pathways , and to react accordingly @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they undergo a jump process where free runs are followed by a reorientation phenomenon called tumble @xcite .",
    "for instance it is known that _",
    "e. coli _ increases the time spent in running along a favourable direction @xcite .",
    "this jump process can be described by two different informations .",
    "first cells switch the rotation of their flagella , from counter - clockwise , called free runs , to clockwise called reorientation or tumbling phase , and conversely .",
    "this decision is the result of a complex chain of reactions inside the cells , driven by the external concentration of the chemoattractant @xcite",
    ". then bacteria select a new direction , but they are unable to choose directly a favourable direction , so they randomly choose a new orientation . during",
    "the `` run '' phases a bacterium moves with a constant speed in a given direction while during a `` tumbling '' event it changes direction randomly .",
    "in the simple situation , c. s. patlak @xcite and e. f. keller & l. a. segel @xcite considered a density of cells which interacts with two chemical substances .",
    "the cells consume nutrients which drive the migration and excrete a chemoattractant that prevents the dispersion of the population . however , this approach is not always sufficiently precise to describe the evolution of bacteria movements .",
    "hence , this phenomenon of run and tumble can be modeled by a stochastic process called the velocity - jump process , and has been introduced by alt @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "a kinetic transport model to describe this velocity jump process consists to study the evolution of the bacterial population by the local density of cells @xmath0 located in position @xmath1 , at time @xmath2 and swimming in the direction @xmath3 .    here",
    "the set @xmath4 of all possible velocities is bounded and symmetric in general . in two dimensions ,",
    "the modulus of the speed is a constant @xmath5 , hence @xmath6 circle centred in @xmath7 with a radius @xmath8 .",
    "a kinetic transport model to describe this velocity - jump process has been introduced by w. alt  @xcite inspired by the boltzmann equation  @xcite where the tumbles appear as scattering events and all the fluxes are explicitly introduced  @xcite .",
    "we consider the boltzmann type equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the boltzmann type tumbling operator @xmath11 the contribution of the tumbles is introduced with a transition ( scattering ) kernel @xmath12 which stands for the change of velocity from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the division rate of the bacteria ( @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mean doubling time ) .",
    "this equation is indeed a variant of the boltzmann equation for gases , where collisions are delocalized via the secretion or consumption of chemical cues .    in ( [ kinetic : eq ] ) , the transition kernel @xmath18 also depends on the local concentration of chemoattractant @xmath19 and nutrient @xmath20 . to estimate the respective contributions on pulse speed of the biais of the run lengths and of preferential reorientation , it is possible to split this transition kernel @xmath21 in two contributions , one being the tumbling rate @xmath22 , and the other one the reorientation effect during tumbles @xmath23 : @xmath24 with the condition @xmath25 where the function @xmath26 accounts for the persistence of the trajectories . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case of the absence of such an angular persistence , hence the turning kernel @xmath21 is only proportional to the tumbling rate @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath26 is constant .    for the tumbling rate @xmath22",
    ", we assume that bacteria are sensitive to the temporal variations of attractant molecules via a logarithmic sensing mechanism  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the tumble frequency only depends on the local gradients of nutrient and attractant , both gradients having independent and additive contributions .",
    "this gives @xmath27    the nutrient and chemoattractant response functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are both positive and decreasing , expressing that cells are less likely to tumble ( thus perform longer runs ) when the external chemical signal increases .",
    "these functions are smooth and characterized by their characteristic time @xmath30 and @xmath31 and their tumble frequency @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    here , we have chosen the following analytical form that encompassed these characteristics : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mean tumbling frequency , and the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the modulation of tumble frequency .    in order to define completely the mathematical problem , suitable boundary conditions on @xmath36 should be applied .",
    "here we consider wall type boundary conditions , for which emerging particles have been reflected elastically at the wall .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath37 the smooth boundary @xmath36 is assumed to have a unit inward normal @xmath38 and for @xmath39 , we assume that at the solid boundary we have @xmath40,\\,\\,\\,\\mathbf{x}\\in\\partial\\omega,\\,\\,\\,\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{x})\\geq 0 , \\label{eq : bcingoing}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 = f(t,\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v}-2(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{x}))\\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{x})).\\ ] ] this boundary condition   guarantees the global conservation of mass  @xcite .",
    "the equations describing the behaviors of nutrients density @xmath42 and chemottractant @xmath43 are the same as in  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the degradation rate of the chemoattractant , its production rate and the consumption rate of the nutrient by the bacteria , whereas @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the molecular diffusion coefficients . finally , these equations are completed with homogeneous neumann boundary conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath50    the purpose of this work is to present a numerical scheme for ( [ kinetic : eq])-([eq : bc : parabolique ] ) and to investigate numerically the occurrence of cells aggregation , pattern formation or travelling waves when it takes place , and the convergence to equilibrium otherwise for different geometries .",
    "several numerical methods have already been developed to solve the patlak - keller - segel model for chemotaxis using finite element methods @xcite , finite volume methods @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "other models have also been investigated numerically @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that none of the above - mentioned numerical approaches have been studied for kinetic models ( [ kinetic : eq])-([eq : bc : parabolique ] ) . in the present paper",
    "we propose a numerical scheme for ( [ kinetic : eq])-([eq : bc : parabolique ] ) and investigate the influence of the geometry on the collective behavior of bacteria .",
    "we now briefly outline the contents of the paper . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the numerical approximation of ( [ kinetic : eq ] ) and ( [ ns : eq ] ) and describe the numerical approximation of the boundary  ,  ,  .",
    "two points are worth mentioning here .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves to the case of specular reflection which seems to be the most appropriate for the study of bacteria .",
    "one difficulty in the approximation of kinetic models for chemotaxis , is related to the fact that it can exhibits very different phenomena as finite time blow - up , cell aggregation , wave propagations . at the discrete level ,",
    "our approximation should also be able to describe a similar property .",
    "secondly , an important step is to discretize appropriately the effect of boundary .",
    "the final section is devoted to numerical simulations performed with the numerical scheme presented in section [ sec : scheme ] .",
    "we investigate numerically cells aggregation , convergence to equilibrium , and wave propagation in a bounded domain .",
    "we consider a computational domain @xmath51\\times[y_{\\min},y_{\\max}]\\times v$ ] , such that @xmath52\\times[y_{\\min},y_{\\max}]$ ] .",
    "the computational domain is covered by an uniform cartesian mesh @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 are defined by @xmath56 the mesh steps are respectively @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "let us denote @xmath60 an approximation of the distribution function @xmath61 .",
    "we introduce the following finite difference scheme @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 is a second - order approximation  @xcite of the transport operator @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is an approximation of the boltzmann type tumbling operator @xmath10 .",
    "we will now focus on searching the approximation @xmath66 .    by using the trapezoidal rule",
    ", we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an approximation of the transition kernel @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the nutrient density @xmath42 and the chemottractant @xmath43 are known at time @xmath69 .",
    "moreover with the hypothesis that @xmath26 is constant , the condition   implies that @xmath70 .",
    "thus it remains to search an approximation of the tumbling rate , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath71 .",
    "it is also equivalent to search the local gradients of nutrient @xmath72 and attractant @xmath73 .",
    "we study only the local gradients of nutrient @xmath72 , since the local gradient of attractant @xmath73 has the same expression as @xmath72 .",
    "we discretize the local gradient of nutrient as follows @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a discrete time derivative and will be given in the section  [ sec : discratisation : parabolique ] .",
    "moreover we use centred difference approximation for @xmath76 , which yields @xmath77 in summary , the discrete tumbling rate reads    @xmath78    finally we reduce the tumbling operator as follows @xmath79      the equations   for nutrient density @xmath42 and chemottractant @xmath43 are parabolic equations with source terms depending on the distribution function of density @xmath80 .",
    "we study again the discretization for nutrient density , since the one for chemottractant is similar .",
    "the euler implicit scheme is used for time integration .",
    "hence the scheme for nutrient density @xmath42 reads @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an approximation of time derivative as follows @xmath83 then we use a five points finite difference scheme to discretize @xmath84 @xmath85 finally , a trapezoidal rule is applied for the integration , _",
    "@xmath86      as we mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : model ] , an appropriate discretization of boundary condition is important to exhibit very different phenomena .",
    "therefore , we present respectively the numerical approximations for specular reflection boundary condition   and neumann boundary condition  .",
    "the specular reflection boundary condition in 2d reads as @xmath87(t,\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v})=f(t,\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v}'),\\ ] ] with @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the point at the boundary , @xmath90 is the interior normal at point @xmath1 .",
    "we note that this specular reflection is just like a mirror .",
    "for example , if we follows the characteristic of the flux @xmath91 , its reflected flow is corresponding to the velocity @xmath13 .",
    "we thus use a mirror procedure to construct @xmath80 at each ghost point .",
    "for instance from the ghost point @xmath92 , we can find an inward normal @xmath93 , which crosses the boundary at @xmath94 ( see figure  [ fig:2ddomain ] ) . for velocity @xmath14 ,",
    "its reflected velocity with respect to @xmath94 is @xmath95 .",
    "thus instead of computing @xmath80 at the ghost point @xmath92 , we compute @xmath80 at mirror point with respect to the boundary @xmath96 as follows @xmath97    spatially two - dimensional cartesian mesh .",
    "@xmath98 is interior point , @xmath99 is ghost point , @xmath100 is the point at the boundary , @xmath101 is the point for extrapolation , the dashed line is the boundary.,width=377 ]    the last step is to approximate @xmath102 using @xmath80 of interior domain . let us assume that the values of the distribution function @xmath80 on the grid points in @xmath103 are given .",
    "we first construct a stencil @xmath104 composed of grid points of @xmath103 for interpolation or extrapolation .",
    "for instance as it is shown in figure  [ fig:2ddomain ] , the inward normal @xmath93 intersects the grid lines @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 at points @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110",
    ". then we choose the three nearest points of the cross point @xmath111 , in each line , _ i.e. _ marked by a large circle . from these nine points , we can build a lagrange polynomial @xmath112 .",
    "therefore we evaluate the polynomial @xmath113 at @xmath114 , and obtain an approximation of @xmath80 at the mirror point .",
    "we distinguish two cases of mirror points .",
    "in the case that mirror point @xmath114 is surrounded by interior points , we interpolate @xmath80 at mirror point @xmath114 ; otherwise a weno type extrapolation can be used to prevent spurious oscillations , which will be detailed below .",
    "note that in some cases , we can not find a stencil of nine interior points .",
    "for instance when the interior domain has small acute angle sharp , the normal @xmath90 can not have three cross points @xmath111 in interior domain , or we can not have three nearest points of the cross point @xmath111 , in each line .",
    "in such a case , we alternatively use a first degree polynomial @xmath115 with a four points stencil or even a zero degree polynomial @xmath116 with an one point stencil .",
    "we can similarly construct the four points stencil or the one point stencil as above .",

    "moreover a slightly modified version of the method was given in  @xcite , such that the smoothness indicators are invariant with respect to the scaling of @xmath80 .",
    "we now describe this method in 2d case .",
    "the substencils @xmath117 for extrapolation are chosen around the inward normal @xmath90 such that we can construct lagrange polynomial of degree @xmath15 .",
    "for instance in figure  [ fig:2ddomain ] , the three substencils are respectively @xmath118 once the substencils @xmath119 are chosen , we could easily construct the lagrange polynomials in @xmath120 @xmath121 satisfying @xmath122 then the weno extrapolation has the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 are the nonlinear weights , which are chosen to be @xmath125 with @xmath126 where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath131 are the smoothness indicators determined by @xmath132 and for @xmath133 , either we take @xmath134 when @xmath135 , or we choose @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a multi - index and @xmath138\\times[y_p-\\delta y/2,y_p+\\delta y/2]$ ] and the point @xmath94 is given by @xmath139 .      in section  [",
    "sec : discratisation : parabolique ] , we have seen that discrete laplace operator   is the only non - locally in space term in  . in figure",
    "[ fig:2ddomain_parapolique ] , we illustrate an example of a discrete laplace operator near the boundary .",
    "we note that @xmath140 is not known , since @xmath141 is out of domain .",
    "to approximate @xmath42 at ghost point @xmath92 , we have to use the boundary condition  .",
    "in fact , if we denote @xmath142 , then the boundary condition   reads @xmath143 using a centered difference formula , it yields @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 is the mirror point of the ghost point @xmath92 with respect to the boundary .",
    "the previous equation is equivalent to @xmath147 therefore instead of computing @xmath42 at the ghost point @xmath92 , we extrapolate @xmath42 at the mirror point @xmath146 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:2ddomain_parapolique ] , a nine points stencil @xmath148 is found , thus we have @xmath149 where @xmath150 is weight of extrapolation calculated , for instance , by lagrange polynomial . finally by injecting   into",
    ", we complete the discretization .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the numerical scheme for the internal domain is disconnected to the numerical procedure for the treatment of the boundary .",
    "therefore the present method can be applied to any other numerical scheme .",

    "in this section , we present a large variety of tests in @xmath151 and one dimensional in velocity space showing the validation of mathematical model and the effectiveness of our numerical schemes . in test 1 , we consider cell aggregation to study only chemotactic motility  @xcite . in test 2 , we consider wave propagation formed by cells reorientation and the presence of nutrients in a disc . in test 3",
    ", we study the interaction of two traveling wave in a @xmath152 shape .",
    "then in test 4 , we consider again the traveling wave but in a more wide @xmath152 shape , which is similar like the effectiveness of centrifugal force .",
    "finally in test 5 we add the effect of cell division for long time behavior using new parameters .",
    "motile bacteria are able to interact with their environment by accumulating in regions of high concentrations of certain chemicals called attractants and avoiding others called repellents .",
    "cell division is not required to generate these multi - cellular structures because they form on a much shorter time scale than the cell - doubling time  @xcite .",
    "the process leading to formation of multi - cellular clusters can be qualitatively understood as follows : fluctuations in the local cell density produce local gradients of attractants .",
    "cells respond by moving up these concentration gradients thus amplifying the initial spatial non - uniformities in the cell distribution and forming multi - cellular clusters .",
