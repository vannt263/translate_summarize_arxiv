    "cosmic strings are one - dimensional topological defects  @xcite .",
    "they can be formed during symmetry breaking phase transitions in the early universe  @xcite , such as might arise if the gauge symmetry group of the standard model  ( sm ) is enlarged by additional @xmath0 factors at high energies  @xcite .",
    "such gauge factors appear naturally in many models of physics beyond the sm .",
    "a typical cosmic string network consists of horizon - length _",
    "long strings _ as well as smaller closed _",
    "string loops_. the long strings carry a net conserved topological charge and are stable , while closed string loops do not have a net charge and can decay away . in the present work we study the production of dark matter by the decays of cosmic string loops  @xcite .    the evolution of cosmic string networks in the early universe has been studied extensively .",
    "it is found that the long strings in the network stretch with the hubble expansion , as well as form closed string loops by the process of _ reconnection _ when they intersect themselves or each other .",
    "after an initial transient , these two processes balance out such that the string network reaches a _ scaling _ regime , in which the total energy density of the network makes up a small , constant fraction of the dominant matter or radiation energy density of the universe  @xcite .",
    "this string energy fraction is largely independent of the initial conditions , and is about @xmath7 relative to the critical density , where @xmath8 is newton s constant and @xmath9 is the string tension . in terms of the scale of spontaneous symmetry",
    "breaking @xmath10 from which the strings arise , the tension is on the order of ^2 .",
    "cosmic string scaling can be modified if the strings have significant interactions with the thermal background that lead to an effective frictional force on the strings .",
    "the importance of friction to the evolution of a string network depends on the pattern of symmetry breaking as well as the temperature of the surrounding plasma .",
    "a possible decay product of the string loops formed by a scaling cosmic string network is dark matter  ( dm )  @xcite .",
    "indirect evidence for cold dark matter has been obtained from a number of sources .",
    "together , they indicate a dark matter density of  @xcite _ dmh^2 = 0.11430.0034 this dark matter density can be explained by the existence of a new weakly - interacting stable particle with a mass on the order of the electroweak scale  ( wimp )  @xcite .",
    "such particles are common in extensions of the sm that stabilize the electroweak scale against quantum corrections such as supersymmetry  @xcite , universal extra dimensions  @xcite , and little higgs models with @xmath11-parity  @xcite .",
    "string loops can produce dm and other particles in a number of ways .",
    "for local cosmic strings , corresponding to the spontaneous breakdown of a gauge symmetry , the direct emission of particles by the strings is thought to be suppressed  @xcite .",
    "instead , loops lose most of their energy by oscillating and emitting gravitational radiation  @xcite . however , when the loop radius shrinks down to the order of the string width , it will self - annihilate into its constituent fields  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent decays of these states can produce dark matter .",
    "an even larger source of string annihilation and particle production by closed loops is the formation of _ cusps _  @xcite .",
    "these are points on a loop where the string segment folds back on itself and briefly approaches the speed of light  @xcite . in the vicinity of a cusp ,",
    "a small portion of the string will self - annihilate creating particles  @xcite . in many simple solutions for the motion of a string loop , a cusp",
    "is generally found to occur about once per loop oscillation period  @xcite .",
    "the amount of dark matter created by a cosmic string network depends on the initial size of the string loops that are formed by the network . while the evolution of the long horizon length strings is well understood , the details of loop formation are less clear . these details are closely related to the spectrum of small fluctuations on long strings .",
    "significant advances have been made recently in this direction , both in numerical simulations  @xcite , as well as in analytic models  ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work we will mostly adopt the results of refs .",
    "@xcite to characterize the initial loop size spectrum .    in the picture of loop formation ( in the scaling regime ) that emerges from refs .",
    "@xcite , fluctuations on long strings are created near the horizon scale @xmath12 , which is also the scale that characterizes the long string network in the scaling regime .",
    "after they are formed , these fluctuations grow less quickly than the horizon , and thereby shrink relative to the characteristic scale of the long string network .",
    "the fluctuation spectrum that emerges is a power law in the fluctuation size that increases going to smaller scales .",
    "this power law is eventually cut off well below the horizon by gravitational radiation damping , which erases very small fluctuations .",
    "the cut - off occurs when the fluctuation size falls below the gravitational radiation scale  @xcite l_gw = ( g)^1 + 2 t [ lgw ] where @xmath13 is a constant , @xmath14 is the cosmic time , and @xmath15 during radiation and @xmath16 during the matter era .",
    "the small fluctuation spectrum on long strings is therefore peaked near @xmath17 .",
    "this peak implies that @xmath17 sets the typical initial loop size @xmath18  @xcite , _",
    "both the number and the energy density of the loops formed are dominated by loops of this initial size . and at very early times , the gravitational damping length @xmath17 can fall below the width of the string , @xmath19 . in this case",
    ", we expect that small fluctuations are cut off at @xmath20 by direct particle emission as suggested in ref .",
    "] however , recent simulations ( and the analytic model of ref .",
    "@xcite ) also point toward a significant loop population near the horizon scale , with @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "we will therefore consider larger loops as well in our analysis .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to compute the dark matter density generated by a network of gauge theory cosmic strings in the scaling regime .",
    "we also calculate the dark matter generated when _ frictional _ interactions of the strings with the background plasma modify the evolution of the network .",
    "a necessary condition for the phenomenological viability of a cosmic string network is that the dark matter density it generates not exceed the observational bound .",
    "our results therefore provide a constraint on theories of new physics that lead to the formation of cosmic strings , such as models containing new @xmath0 gauge groups that arise frequently in superstring theory constructions and in models of grand unification  @xcite .",
    "our results also motivate certain classes of gauge extensions of the standard model that are able to generate the observed dark matter relic density by cosmic string loop decay . while we concentrate on the dark matter produced by a network of cosmic strings , our methods",
    "can also be applied to computing the densities of other cosmologically interesting particles arising from cosmic string loop decays , such as moduli and gravitinos .",
    "we find that for symmetry breaking scales @xmath10 larger than @xmath1 , the decays of cosmic string loops derived from a network of long cosmic strings that are scaling or dominated by friction can potentially generate ( more than ) enough cold dark matter to account for the observed relic density .",
    "the precise density depends on the typical initial loop size and the effective branching fraction of the loop decays into cold dark matter , in addition to @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 , for which the standard cosmic string signatures such as gravitational radiation and gravitational lensing are expected to be unobservably weak  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath10 is much smaller than @xmath1 , including those scales for which the massive @xmath2 gauge boson associated with the symmetry breaking could be visible at the lhc , the density of non - thermal dark matter produced by this mechanism is well below the observed value .",
    "thus , such models are not constrained by dark matter overproduction from scaling string loops .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ formula ]",
    "we derive a general formula for the production of dark matter by cosmic string loops . in section",
    "[ scaling ] , we apply this formula to compute the amount of dark matter produced by string loops in the scaling regime . in section  [ friction ]",
    "we extend our results to compute the dark matter density from cosmic string loops when friction plays an important role in the evolution of the string network .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusion ] is reserved for our conclusions .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us point out that the production of dark matter by the decays of cosmic string loops was considered previously for _ ordinary _ abelian higgs model cosmic strings in ref .",

    "@xcite , and for cosmic strings associated with aspects of superstring theory in refs .",

    "@xcite in a number of ways .",
    "most importantly , we focus on cusping as the primary source of particle production by cosmic strings .",
    "we also make use of the recent results on the size distribution of string loops when they are formed from refs .",
    "@xcite , and we consider the evolution of cosmic string networks both with and without friction . when friction is relevant , we extend ref .  @xcite by using the analytic model of ref .",

    ", the loop will eventually decay away completely at the time @xmath33 , defined implicitly by 0 = ( t_co;_i , t_i ) .",
    "while the loop is decaying , it will emit a fraction of its energy in the form of ( cold ) dark matter .",
    "we will write this fraction as @xmath34 .    to find the total rate of dark matter production by the collection of string loops , consider loops with initial size in the range @xmath29 formed in the time interval @xmath28 .",
    "there are @xmath35 such loops per unit volume initially .",

    "[ cuspalf ] we show the dark matter relic density due to cusping as a function of the initial loop size parameter @xmath50 , normalized to @xmath67 , with the other parameter values as described above .",
    "we normalize @xmath50 to @xmath67 because , in the absence of cusping , a loop is long - lived relative to the hubble time at formation ( @xmath68 ) provided @xmath69 , and short - lived otherwise . from this plot",
    ", we see that increasing the initial loop size @xmath50 well above @xmath67 increases the final dark matter density .",
    "the reason for this is that the integration over @xmath24 in eq .",
    "is dominated by the earliest times for which loops produced at @xmath24 decay after @xmath42 . since larger loops are longer - lived , loops contributing to the dark matter density can be formed at earlier times when the integrand of eq .",

    "loops then become short - lived only when @xmath72 .",

    "this occurs because cusping is the dominant energy loss mechanism around time @xmath42 for these loops .",
    "reducing @xmath53 thus further increases the lifetime of these long - lived loops which , as discussed above , enhances the final dark matter density . for larger values of @xmath10 ,",
    "gravitational radiation dominates at time @xmath42 , so that reducing @xmath53 only decreases the fraction of energy released as dark matter without significantly altering the loop lifetime .",
    "we have only computed here the contribution to the dark matter density from loops formed in the scaling regime .",
    "loops created in the string - forming phase transition at time @xmath40 and while the string network was evolving towards scaling will give an additional contribution to the dark matter density if they decay after @xmath42 .",
    "the approach of a string network to scaling depends on the details of the phase transition , and a study of this process is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , we can derive the condition for loops formed in the phase transition to decay before @xmath42 .",
    "we obtain p_c^-2/5()^3/5(710 ^ 3 ) .",
    "if this bound is satisfied and scaling is attained quickly after the network is formed at @xmath40 , loops formed in the scaling regime will give the dominant contribution to the dark matter density .",
    "this bound also indicates that our results are applicable to the phenomenologically interesting case of a @xmath0 gauge symmetry broken only slightly above the electroweak scale provided @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    before moving on ,",
    "let us mention two additional effects that we have not yet taken into account .",
    "the first is that we have treated the loops as having no net motion relative to the thermal background , even though it is found in refs .",
    "@xcite that small loops ( @xmath83 ) can be highly boosted .",
    "this boost does not alter the cusping power , although the expression for this power in eq .",
    "picks up a factor of @xmath84 ( for short - lived loops ) , where @xmath27 is the boost factor .",
    "the decay products will also be boosted .",
    "unless the loops are very tiny , however , this boost is not expected to greatly modify our results .    a second and potentially much larger effect that we have not yet included is that the decay products from a loop cusp can be very highly boosted , even if the loop is initially at rest .",
    "the size of this boost @xmath85 was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite to be = . on account of this boost",
    ", the cusp decay products including the dark matter might not thermalize immediately upon production .",
    "if not , they may thermalize at a later time , or even remain as hot dark matter .    to estimate the effect of this possibly very large boost , we adopt a simple picture of the cusp decay products as consisting of a _ bunch _ of light states ( including wimp dark matter ) moving together with a boost @xmath85 relative to the thermal background . in the rest frame of the bunch",
    "we assume very little relative motion , and that a fraction @xmath86 of the total bunch energy consists of dark matter particles of mass @xmath87 .",
    "the dark matter in the bunch will thermalize when @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the total plasma number density of light states and @xmath90 is the cross - section for the dark matter to scatter off the thermal background . to estimate the thermalization time , we take this cross - section to be = = . with this cross - section ,",
    "the dark matter decay products from a cusp on a small loop with @xmath91 formed at time @xmath42 will reach kinetic equilibrium nearly instantaneously after the cusp occurs when the symmetry breaking scale lies below @xmath80 . in this case , our previous estimates for the dark matter density remain valid .",
    "if the cusp decay products do not thermalize instantaneously , they may still thermalize at a later time @xmath92 as their momentum redshifts . to compute the final density of cold dark matter in this case ,",
    "it is only necessary to add a factor of @xmath93 to the integrand of eq .   and modify the limits of integration such that @xmath94 rather than @xmath95 . doing so , we find that the resulting dark matter density coincides with what we found previously ( without the boost ) up to an overall factor of order unity even when instantaneous thermalization does not occur .",
    "the additional redshift @xmath93 is cancelled nearly exactly by the delay in termalization , which allows loops contributing to the dark matter density to be formed at earlier times when the rate of loop production was larger .",
    "similar to before , we also find that the dominant contribution to the cold dark matter density comes from loop decay products that thermalize shortly after @xmath42 .",
    "the prospect of highly boosted decay products also raises several new issues .",
    "since a large fraction of the energy of the cusp typically goes into the kinetic energy of the decay products , the fraction of this energy that ends up as _ cold _ dark matter can be suppressed .",
    "if kinetic thermalization proceeds exclusively through elastic collisions , we would have @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the boost factor at the time of thermalization .",
    "the actual value of @xmath58 can be larger than this if inelastic collisions during thermalization generate additional dark matter particles , but in general we expect a significant suppression of @xmath58 relative to the non - boosted case . highly boosted loop decay products can also generate relics that have not thermalized by the present time ( or the time of matter - radiation equality ) .",
    "in general , the resulting densities of hot dark matter are suppressed by factors of @xmath7 and are safely small for lower values of the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "however , a reliable precise estimate is complicated by the fact that for extremely large boosts , the cusp decay products will navely have super - planckian momenta .",
    "a full analysis of this issue is beyond the scope of the present work .    in summary ,",
    "our results indicate that the density of wimp cold dark matter generated by string loops from cusping with @xmath98 in the scaling regime is safely below the observed value for @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) . for values of the symmetry - breaking scale",
    "larger than this , the string - induced dark matter density depends on the initial loop size .",
    "loops of initial size @xmath101 , motivated by the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , can create as much or more than the observed dark matter density for @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) if the branching fraction @xmath58 is on the order of unity .",
    "larger loops , with @xmath104 , can lead to a much greater dark matter density .",
    "if such large loops are typical , the branching fraction into dark matter @xmath58 must be significantly less than unity if the cosmic strings are to avoid overproducing dark matter .",
    "this is natural for large loops , whose cusps generate very highly boosted decay products , leading to much of the cusp energy being lost to kinetic energy that is transferred to the thermal bath rather than cold dark matter .",
    "let us also emphasize that for models with a new @xmath0 gauge symmetry broken only slightly above the electroweak scale , the cold dark matter produced by the corresponding cosmic string network in the scaling regime is negligibly small for both large and small initial loop sizes .",
    "the evolution of a cosmic string network can be modified if the strings have significant interactions with the thermal background . as we will discuss below",
    ", the relevance of these interactions to the string network depends on the details of the symmetry breaking from which the cosmic strings arise .",
    "such interactions , when present , tend to slow the motion of the strings by creating an effective frictional force on them  @xcite .",
    "this in turn changes the density and rate of growth of the network .",

    "the discussion above provides all the ingredients needed to evaluate the dark matter density created by a string network in the presence of friction using eq .  .",

    "such large values of @xmath10 imply a value of @xmath116 that is much smaller than the freeze - out time @xmath42 , so that all loops generated while friction is relevant decay away before @xmath42 . on the other hand , when @xmath10 lies below @xmath133 , the most important contribution to the dark matter comes from loops formed while friction dominates the network evolution , @xmath134 .    in the region",
    "@xmath135 most of the dark matter is produced by loops that are formed in the friction era , with @xmath136 . as a result ,",
    "the dark matter density is independent of the scaling value of @xmath50 for this range of @xmath10 .",
    "the largest contribution to the dark matter in this region comes from loops that are also long - lived , with @xmath137 .",
    "this enhances the amount of dark matter formed because , with the loop distribution function of eq .  , the integrand of the @xmath24 integral in eq .",
    "is a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath24 .",
    "increasing @xmath10 in this region leads to larger initial loop sizes that further extend the loop lifetime .",
    "however , the minimal value of @xmath24 for which loops decay after @xmath42 decreases more slowly with increasing @xmath10 than @xmath116 .",
    "the sharp transition near @xmath138 occurs when these two quantities become equal .",
    "when this happens , increasing @xmath10 further decreases the initial loop size ( see eq .  ) for the dominant dm loops , and these loops go quickly from being long - lived to being short - lived , with the dominant loops being formed near @xmath139 .",
    "the transition is more gradual when the exponent @xmath128 in eq .   is less than @xmath140 , which can be seen by comparing with the curve for @xmath141 .    for @xmath142 ,",
    "the initial loop size @xmath105 becomes small enough that the loops are short - lived , decaying away within a hubble time .",
    "thus , the majority of the dark matter produced for these smaller values of @xmath10 comes from loops formed near the freeze - out time , @xmath143 , with initial size close to @xmath144 .",
    "as @xmath10 decreases below @xmath145 , we find that a larger fraction of the energy of each loop is lost to cusping , thereby increasing the dark matter density .",
    "even so , the dark matter relic density generated by cosmic strings for @xmath146 is a negligibly small fraction of the observed value .",
    "we have investigated the cold dark matter density created by the decays of loops of gauge cosmic strings .",
    "dark matter is produced by string loops when they form cusps . at a cusp , a small portion of the string loop annihilates into its constituent fields , which can then cascade down to lighter states such as dark matter particles .",
    "our results provide constraints on extensions of the gauge symmetry group of the standard model that give rise to cosmic strings in the early universe .",
    "the string loops that give decay to dark matter are themselves created continually by the network of long , horizon - length strings .",
    "we have studied the amount of dark matter generated when this network is in the _ scaling _ regime , and when its evolution is dominated by frictional forces .",
    "both cases are physically relevant as the presence or absence of significant frictional interactions depends on the details of the symmetry breaking from which the strings originate",
    ".    the dark matter density generated by a string network in the scaling regime can potentially be enough to explain the observed relic density when the breaking vev @xmath10 exceeds @xmath1 .",
    "the amount of dark matter produced by this mechanism is greatest when the initial loop size approaches a significant fraction of the cosmological horizon , although much smaller initial loop sizes can also generate sizeable densities of dark matter .",
    "however , larger loops have cusp decay products that are highly boosted , and this can reduce the fraction of the loop energy that becomes cold dark matter . for values of @xmath10 below @xmath1 , the amount cold dark matter created by a scaling string network is always well below the observed value .",
    "string networks that are strongly influenced by frictional interactions can also generate a dark matter density that is equal to or greater than the observed value .",
    "this can occur if the symmetry breaking scale is greater than about @xmath147 .",
    "for very large values of the symmetry breaking scale , above about @xmath148 , frictional effects decouple well before the non - thermal dark matter is created ; the frictional interactions do not alter the resulting dark matter density .",
    "when the symmetry breaking scale is much below @xmath147 , the contributions to the dark matter density in the presence of friction are very small .",
    "this contrasts with and is less constraining than the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the effects of cusping on the decays of loops were not included in computing the dark matter density .",
    "we conclude from our investigation that the non - thermal cold dark matter relic density is safely below the observed value when the symmetry breaking scale is less than @xmath149 . for larger symmetry breaking scales ,",
    "the non - thermal dark matter density produced by decaying string loops can potentially be as large or larger than the observed value .",
    "thus , our results also put constraints on new gauge symmetries broken at very high scales based on the requirement that they do not overproduce dark matter .",
    "these constraints are model - dependent , in that they depend on the effective branching fraction of the decaying string loops into dark matter , but they can be more severe than the constraints from the more traditional cosmic string signatures such as gravitational radiation and gravitational lensing  @xcite . for gauge symmetries broken at lower scales that could be probed by the lhc , we find that the contribution to the dark matter density from their corresponding scaling string loops is negligibly small .",
