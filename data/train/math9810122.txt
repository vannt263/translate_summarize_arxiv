    "in @xcite are introduced _ polygon spaces _ , which are a family of symplectic manifolds often possessing many interesting circle actions . in the case of pentagons with distinct edge - lengths , they are actually ( symplectomorphic to ) toric varieties .",
    "so it is rather a surprise that the regular pentagon space , although _ diffeomorphic _ to the nearby nearly - regular pentagon spaces , admits no symplectic circle action at all .    in what follows",
    "we calculate the riemann - roch number of the regular pentagon space , @xmath1 , and its euler characteristic , @xmath2 . this will already be enough to show it is nt a toric variety . to prove the stronger statement we invoke results of karshon @xcite on arbitrary symplectic @xmath3-manifolds with circle actions .",
    "we remind the reader of the definition of pentagon spaces and why they are frequently symplectomorphic to toric varieties @xcite . in what follows",
    "our cohomology groups will always be with real coefficients .      given a list @xmath4 of positive real numbers , define the _ pentagon space _",
    "@xmath5 as the space of 5-step closed piecewise - linear paths in @xmath6 starting at the origin , with step - lengths @xmath7 , considered up to @xmath8-rotation .",
    "as such , it is a subquotient of the _ path space _ @xmath9 of 5-step paths in @xmath6 starting at the origin , not necessarily closing up nor quotiented by @xmath8 .",
    "regarding @xmath10 as a symplectic manifold with area @xmath11 , this construction can be interpreted as producing the pentagon space as a symplectic quotient of the path space by @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , the pentagon space is also symplectic when it is smooth ; this happens exactly if no two of the edges put together have the same total length as the other three put together .",
    "we define a _ nearly - regular _ pentagon space @xmath5 to be one in which the sum of any two edge - lengths @xmath12 is _ less _ than the sum of the other three .",
    "in particular these spaces are smooth , and of course include the regular pentagon space @xmath13 .",
    "as we will see below , any nearly - regular pentagon space is diffeomorphic to @xmath14 ; so when we now restrict attention to nearly - regular pentagon spaces , we can view this as studying different symplectic structures on the same manifold .",
    "take now the generic case that @xmath15 , @xmath16 .    in @xcite",
    "are defined the _ bending flows _ on such a polygon space .",
    "label the vertices a , b , c , d , e , and draw the diagonals ac and ad , breaking the pentagon into three triangles abc , acd , and ade .",
    "since these diagonals can not be zero length ( by the genericity assumption above ) , each one gives a circle action : break off the triangles abc and ade and reattach them rotated by independent angles . in fact these circle actions on this symplectic manifold are hamiltonian , with the hamiltonians given by the lengths of the diagonals @xmath17 .",
    "in @xcite we calculated the image of the map @xmath17 in @xmath18 ; in the nearly - regular case we always get a rectangle missing three corners .",
    "( see figure [ fig : momentpoly ] below . ) with this and delzant s reconstruction theorem it is immediate that the space is diffeomorphic to @xmath14 .",
    "in particular the @xmath2 vertices says that the euler characteristic is @xmath2 .",
    "actually one can do slightly better than this abstract diffeomorphism .",
    "fix @xmath19 .",
    "then for @xmath20 the edge - lengths of a nearly - regular pentagon space there is a canonical ( up to isotopy ) diffeomorphism @xmath21 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "call @xmath22 the ( well - defined ) class @xmath23 .",
    "any compact symplectic manifold @xmath24 has a canonical `` todd class '' @xmath25 , constructed by endowing the manifold with an auxiliary almost complex structure .",
    "( in fact pentagon spaces are actually complex @xcite . )",
    "the _ riemann - roch number _ @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 ) { { \\rm td\\,}}m$ ] and only depends on the cohomology class @xmath28 $ ] of the symplectic form .",
    "note that we have not assumed integrality of @xmath29 for this definition ; rather , this is a polynomial function on @xmath30 which merely happens to take on integral values at integral @xmath29 . in the case of pentagon spaces",
    "this exactly corresponds to the side - lengths being integral ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.6 , p. 304 ) .",
    "[ intrr ] as in the last section , fix @xmath31 the regular pentagon space , but change the symplectic form to @xmath32 , where @xmath5 is a toric , integral , nearly - regular pentagon space",
    ". then the riemann - roch number of @xmath33 is @xmath34    if @xmath31 is a toric manifold with moment map @xmath35 , @xmath29 integral , and some ( therefore every ) fixed point of @xmath31 maps to a lattice point in @xmath36 under @xmath37 , then the riemann - roch number of @xmath31 is equal to the number of lattice points in the image of @xmath37 @xcite .    in our case",
    "the moment map is @xmath38 .",
    "assume for convenience that @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( they may be switched if necessary without affecting the riemann - roch number ) .",
    "then by pick s theorem @xcite the number of lattice points in figure [ fig : momentpoly ] is the area plus one - half the number of lattice points on the boundary plus one .",
    "the area is @xmath41 and the boundary has @xmath42 lattice points .",
    "expanding and collecting terms we get the result ( which is , as it should be , symmetric in @xmath43 ) .",
    "[ 5gorr ] the formula from lemma [ intrr ] holds for any nearly - regular pentagon space ; in particular @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be any open cone in @xmath46 of dimension @xmath47 , i.e. an open subset closed under multiplication by positive reals .",
    "( for us , the relevant @xmath46 will be @xmath30 , and @xmath45 the space of classes of symplectic forms from nearly - regular pentagon spaces . )",
    "we first observe that a polynomial @xmath48 on @xmath46 is determined by its values on @xmath49 .",
    "proof : @xmath48 is dominated by its highest - order terms , @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath50 vanishes on @xmath49 , it vanishes on @xmath51 by homogeneity , therefore on all of @xmath45 by continuity , therefore everywhere by analyticity .",
    "next we find a basis of @xmath30 with which to apply this .",
    "recall that we constructed the pentagon space by reduction from the @xmath52-step path space @xmath53 by @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath54 is trivial ( recall we re using real coefficients ) , by kirwan s theorem the linear map from @xmath55 to @xmath30 is surjective . by dimension",
    "count it is an isomorphism ( the moment polytope lets us determine that @xmath56 is also @xmath52 ) .",
    "so the obvious basis of @xmath57  which is what we were using to write down the vectors @xmath4  gives us a basis for @xmath30 .",
    "since the riemann - roch number of @xmath24 is a polynomial function on @xmath30 , and has been determined on the subset of integral , positive , distinct @xmath4 in lemma [ intrr ] , the formula in lemma [ intrr ] in fact calculates the riemann - roch number for any nearly - regular pentagon space .",
    "it is worth mentioning a corollary : the symplectic volume ( which is always the leading term in the riemann - roch number ) of a nearly - regular pentagon space is @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 .",
    "so far we know its riemann - roch number is @xmath1 and its euler characteristic is @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that @xmath60 admits a hamiltonian action of a 2-torus @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the moment polytope in @xmath63 .",
    "as @xmath60 is an integral symplectic manifold , one may translate @xmath62 so that its vertices are lattice points . since @xmath60 s euler characteristic is @xmath2",
    ", @xmath62 has @xmath2 vertices , and thus at least @xmath2 lattice points .",
    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath64 , since the riemann - roch number of a toric manifold is the number of lattice points in its moment polytope .",
    "one may suppose that the minimum value of @xmath66 is @xmath67 . as @xmath60 is an integral symplectic manifold ,",
    "the critical values of @xmath66 are then integers ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.5 ) and its proof ) .",
    "observe that there are more than two critical values .",
    "otherwise , @xmath60 would be @xmath68 or an @xmath69-bundle over @xmath69 ( @xcite ) , neither of which fit with @xmath70 .",
    "also , at least one of the extremal level sets ( say the minimal one ) is not an isolated point .",
    "otherwise , @xmath66 would have only isolated critical points and then be a toric manifold by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) , which contradicts the lemma above .      1 .",
    "@xmath74 is the area of the sphere @xmath75 which is an integer since @xmath29 is integral .",
    "the slope of @xmath71 at @xmath67 is the euler class of the normal bundle of @xmath75 in @xmath60 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.12 ) ) .",
    "the slope of @xmath71 changes exactly at each critical value of @xmath66 and the graph of @xmath71 is concave ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmas 2.12 and 2.19 ) .",
    "[ last ] the number of integral points enclosed by the graph of @xmath71 is + @xmath64 .",
    "one checks that the only possible @xmath71 function must then satisfy @xmath76 therefore , the maximum level @xmath77 would be an isolated point .",
    "but the slope of @xmath71 at an extremal isolated point should be @xmath78 in absolute value ( ( * ? ? ?",
