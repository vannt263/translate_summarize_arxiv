    "the only source of cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) is the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) phase , which seems to be the origin of cp violation in nondiagonal processes @xcite , as suggested by the experimental data on @xmath6-@xmath16 mixing @xcite .",
    "several studies @xcite suggest , however , that the ckm phase has a rather marginal effect on cp - violating flavor - diagonal processes such as the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of elementary particles , which means that this class of properties may be highly sensitive to any new physics effects . while the static electromagnetic properties of the leptons have been long studied",
    "both theoretically and experimentally , those of the heaviest sm particles still require more attention .",
    "in particular , the cp - violating properties of the @xmath1 boson and the top quark are extremely suppressed in the sm ( the @xmath1 boson edm arises up to two loops and the top quark edm arises first at three loops ) , so their study may shed light on the origin of cp violation .",
    "it is thus worth analyzing alternative sources of cp violation that may manifest themselves via the static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 boson and the top quark .",
    "the fact that the on - shell @xmath17 vertex is gauge - independent has long motivated the study of its behavior under radiative corrections because this allows one to estimate the sensitivity of the yang - mills sector to any physics beyond the fermi scale .",
    "much theoretical work has gone into studying the cp - even static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 boson , but its experimental determination still awaits a higher experimental precision .",
    "as far as the cp - odd electromagnetic properties are concerned , they are by far more suppressed within the sm , thereby offering an ideal laboratory for searching for any new physics effects . by invoking lorentz and electromagnetic gauge invariance , regardless of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 conservation , the on - shell @xmath17 vertex can be characterized by five independent form factors @xcite .",
    "vanishes at any order of perturbation theory @xcite . ]",
    "three of these form factors are cp - even @xmath21 and two are cp - odd , @xmath22 . while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are already generated at the level of the classical action , @xmath25 first arises at the one - loop level .",
    "the anomalous contributions to @xmath24 and @xmath25 have been calculated in the sm @xcite and several of its extensions @xcite . as for the cp - odd form factors , they are naturally suppressed because they can only arise at the one - loop level or higher orders in any renormalizable theory . despite their suppression , the scrutiny of the cp - violating @xmath1 boson properties may provide relevant information for our knowledge of cp violation .",
    "the electric dipole and magnetic quadrupole moments can be generated at the one - loop level via the @xmath26 form factor in some extended models .",
    "since the presence of a trace involving the @xmath27 dirac matrix is necessary in order to generate a levi - civitta tensor , it is clear that these cp - violating moments can only be induced at the one - loop level via a fermionic loop .",
    "it has been shown that this class of effects can arise in theories including both left- and right - handed fermion currents with a complex phase @xcite .",
    "this possibility has already been explored within the context of left - right symmetric models @xcite , though the respective contribution was found highly suppressed due to the experimental constraints on the @xmath28 mixing .    as far as the static electromagnetic properties of the top quark are concerned",
    ", the forthcoming years will see a vigorous boost in the theoretical interest and experimental scrutiny of this particle s properties . specifically , the largest priority at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the study of the top quark fundamental properties , and further studies are planned at the next linear collider ( nlc ) via top quark pair production .",
    "interesting experimental and theoretical prospects are open due to the fact that the top quark has a mass of the order of the fermi scale , which poses the question whether it is just an ordinary quark or a composite particle .",
    "the top quark decays very quickly , mainly into a @xmath29 pair , before any hadronization takes place , which may allow one to examine its properties without the presence of any unwanted qcd effects , which invariably would swamp the processes involving the light quarks .",
    "this peculiarity opens the door to the scrutiny of the top quark electromagnetic properties , thereby allowing the possibility of detecting a nonvanishing cp - violating electric dipole moment ( edm ) .",
    "several studies have been devoted to analyze the electric or weak dipole form factors of the top quark and the so induced cp violation . along these lines",
    ", several studies on cp violation in @xmath30 production have been pursued in the context of hadron @xcite , @xmath31 @xcite , and @xmath32 @xcite colliders . despite its suppression in the sm ,",
    "the top quark edm can be significantly enhanced in a broad class of beyond - the - sm extensions .",
    "for instance , studies within the context of multi - higgs models @xcite have shown that the top quark edm may be several orders of magnitude larger than the sm prediction .",
    "since the study of the cp - odd static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 boson and the top quark may hint to the origin of cp violation , it is worth considering any possible sources of this class of effects . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the potential cp - violating effects of the most general dimension - four @xmath0 coupling , which involves both left- and right - handed components with a complex phase , on the cp - odd static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 boson and the top quark .",
    "the relevance of this coupling is evident from the fact that the top quark decays mainly into a @xmath29 pair .",
    "although there is a plenty of theoretical work that has considered its tree - level effects , it is also interesting to study its possible impact in one - loop processes . due to the large mass of the top quark , which is the only known quark with a mass of the order of the electroweak scale",
    ", it has been conjectured that it may induce new dynamics effects and even more play a special role in the mechanism of mass generation , which has attracted the interest on the study of any anomalous contributions to its couplings to other sm particles .",
    "even more , the copious production of top quark events expected at the lhc will allow us to study more carefully the top quark properties and examine possible new physics effects induced by this particle .",
    "very interestingly , this class of new physics effects would arise at the electroweak scale , in contrast with other type of new physics efffects that are expected to arise at heavier energy scales .",
    "the role that the @xmath0 coupling might play in a scenario in which the mass is not generated via the higgs mechanism has been examined by several authors @xcite through diverse phenomenological studies @xcite .",
    "instead of considering a specific model , we will adopt a model - independent approach by considering the @xmath0 anomalous contributions in the context of an electroweak chiral lagrangian ( ewcl ) @xcite in which the @xmath33 symmetry is nonlinearly realized as it is assumed that the higgs boson is very heavy or does not exist at all .",
    "we can think of this scenario as the one in which the ewcl parametrizes unknown physics that is not dictated by the higgs mechanism .",
    "several authors have already studied this vertex in this context , and diverse scenarios have been taken into account to obtain limits on the left- and right - handed couplings @xcite . along these lines , some top quark production mechanisms have been considered @xcite . in particular ,",
    "some hadronic processes have been used to impose limits on the cp - violating phases associated with the general left- and right - handed structure of the @xmath0 coupling @xcite .",
    "these results will be used below to estimate the values of the @xmath1 electric dipole and magnetic quadrupole moments .",
    "thus , the main aim of this work is using the most recent bounds on the anomalous terms of the @xmath0 vertex to predict the effects of this coupling on the static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 boson and the top quark .",
    "this approach is in accordance with the spirit of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "this paper has been organized as follows .",
    "the most general structure of the @xmath0 vertex is introduced in the context of the ewcl in sec .",
    "ii , whereas the respective contribution to the cp - violating static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 boson and the top quark are calculated in sec .",
    "section iv is devoted to analyze our results , and the conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "if the higgs mechanism is not realized in nature , whatever is the true mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , it would open unexpected avenues for new physics effects .",
    "in particular , new sources of cp violation might show up .",
    "the unknown new physics can be parametrized using the effective lagrangian technique in which the electroweak symmetry is nonlinearly realized .",
    "the resultant lagrangian is known as the ewcl . in this approach ,",
    "the higgs doublet is replaced by a dimensionless matrix field that transforms nonlinearly under the @xmath33 group @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are goldstone bosons , @xmath37 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath38 is the fermi scale . under the @xmath33 group , @xmath39 transform as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the parameters of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 groups , respectively . from these expressions , it is easy to see that the goldstone bosons fields transform nonlinearly under the electroweak group . in this scheme ,",
    "the gauge fields are defined in the following way @xmath46    to define the most general expression for the charged current , it is necessary to introduce some bosonic and fermionic lorentz structures .",

    "<S> in the framework of the electroweak chiral lagrangian , the one - loop induced effects of the anomalous @xmath0 coupling , which includes both left- and right - handed complex components , on the static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 boson and the @xmath2 quark are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the attention is focused mainly on the cp - violating electromagnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the @xmath0 anomalous coupling can induce both cp - violating moments of the @xmath1 boson , namely , its electric dipole ( @xmath3 ) and magnetic quadrupole ( @xmath4 ) moments . as far as the @xmath2 quark is concerned , a potentially large electric dipole moment @xmath5 can arise due to the anomalous @xmath0 coupling . the most recent bounds on the left- and right - handed parameters from @xmath6 meson physics lead to the following estimates @xmath7 e@xmath8 cm and @xmath9 e@xmath8 @xmath10 , which are @xmath11 and @xmath12 orders of magnitude larger than the standard model ( sm ) predictions , whereas @xmath13 may be as large as @xmath14 e@xmath8 cm , which is about @xmath15 orders of magnitude larger than its sm counterpart . </S>"
