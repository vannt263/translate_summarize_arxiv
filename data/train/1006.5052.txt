    "linear @xmath8 vs @xmath10 behavior is distinctly different from an haf @xcite or a hubbard model @xcite with @xmath234 and finite @xmath162 that exceeds @xmath235 of the @xmath153 maximum .",
    "linear @xmath8 following an onset has been observed @xcite in several alkali - tcnq salts up to @xmath236 , the limit of their thermal stability . in our opinion ,",
    "such @xmath8 in regular arrays are signatures of bow phases with @xmath237 in hubbard - type models as well as in @xmath36 .",
    "there are several reasons for considering 1:1 alkali - tcnq salts as possible bow systems .",
    "the strongest case @xcite is for rb - tcnq(ii ) : its @xmath238 structure has regular stacks of @xmath239 at inversion centers , negligible @xmath8 us to @xmath240 and infrared spectra that indicate broken electronic inversion symmetry .",
    "hubbard - type models have long been used for the magnetic , optical and electrical properties of quasi-1d organic ion - radical crystals @xcite .",
    "the singly occupied mos of @xmath239 form a half - filled band",
    ". the bow phase of hubbard - type models is narrow , close to the cdw transition .",
    "1:1 alkali - tcnq crystals are close @xcite to the cdw transition based on their electrostatic ( madelung ) energy and the electronic structure of @xmath239 .",
    "the spin susceptibility of @xmath36 is encouraging for a bow interpretation .",
    "more quantitative modeling will require values for @xmath13 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and other microscopic parameters .",
    "+ in summary , we have characterized the bow phase of the linear spin-1/2 chain @xmath36 with frustrated first and second neighbor exchange .",
    "we exploited the exact gs at @xmath220 for finite @xmath31 to obtain the bow amplitude @xmath224 , the magnetic gap @xmath4 , the spectrum of low - energy excitations , and topological spin solitons between bows with opposite phases .",
    "the spin chain makes possible a detailed examination of a bow phase . while quantitative results are limited to @xmath36 , the consequences of broken inversion symmetry , gs degeneracy and finite @xmath4 hold for bow phases in general .",
    "the spin susceptibility of @xmath36 is consistent with the unusual @xmath8 of alkali - tcnq salts with regular stacks and provides additional support for the hypothesis @xcite that these salts are physical realizations of bow phases .",
