    "after the observation of top quark with mass much heavier than the rest of the standard model(sm ) fermions and gauge bosons , special attention to its couplings with gauge bosons has been drawn .",
    "since the coupling @xmath1 is responsible for all top quark decays , it plays crucial role to help understand the nature of electroweak theory and `` new physics '' beyond .",
    "therefore it is important to study @xmath1 vertex and measure the coupling parameters with high precision .",
    "single top quark production processes provide unique possibility to search for this vertex due to their direct proportionality to the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "deviations from the sm expectation in @xmath1 vertex would be a possible signal for the new physics beyond sm .",
    "several collider experiment potentials have been examined to search for these coupling parameters through single top production .",
    "single top cross section for the process @xmath5 has been discussed below and above @xmath6 threshold @xcite and for the process @xmath7 at cern @xmath8 collider lep2 @xcite and linear @xmath8 collider(lc ) @xcite energies .",
    "investigations for @xmath1 vertex have been done at @xmath9 mode of lc @xcite , fermilab @xmath10 collider tevatron and cern @xmath11 collider lhc @xcite .    additional option of linear @xmath8 collider would be an @xmath0 collider when lc is constructed on the same base as the proton ring .",
    "linear collider design tesla at desy is the one that can be converted into tesla+herap @xmath0 collider @xcite .",
    "similar option would be considered for clic+lhc at cern .",
    "estimations about the main parameters of these collider modes are shown in table [ tab1 ] for two different design values of linear electron beam energies .    in this paper , the potential of future high energy ep colliders to investigate anomalous @xmath1 couplings will be discussed .",
    "in the model independent effective lagrangian approach @xcite there are seven anomalous cp conserving operators of dimension six which contribute @xmath1 vertex @xcite .",
    "this effective lagrangian contains four independent couplings whose explicit forms are given in ref .",

    "the ( v+a ) coupling @xmath16 is severely bounded by the cleo @xmath17 data @xcite at a level such that it will be out of reach at expected future colliders .",

    "the two subprocesses have a region of overlap when @xmath36 in the w - gluon fusion is nearly collinear ( close to on shell ) so that @xmath37 quark interacting with w boson is the same as the initial @xmath37 sea quark in the first subprocess @xmath27 . in order to take care of this double counting",

    "the expected number of events in the i - th bin which is used in statistical error has been calculated considering the leptonic channel of w boson as the signal @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the overall efficiency and @xmath75 is the integrated luminosity .",

    "only one of the couplings is assumed to deviate from the sm at a time . with integrated luminosities in table [ tab5 ]",
    "the potential sensitivities of tesla+herap to both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are about @xmath76 ( @xmath77 with 10% systematic ) in the case of higher energy option @xmath49 tev which improve the results obtained at tevatron @xcite . for possible clic+lhc energies from table [ tab6 ] , sensitivities to @xmath3 and @xmath4",

    "systematic uncertainties from @xmath15 , @xmath32 , parton distribution functions , qcd scales , luminosity measurement are also important for accurate results . however , at this stage it is difficult to give a realistic estimate of systematics .",
    "therefore , combined systematic errors of 0.05 and 0.10 are taken into account and @xmath80 overall efficiency is assumed . for more precise results ,",
