    "the acceleration of the universe , as confirmed by various cosmological observations such as ia type supernovae , cmb , wmap , etc . has been the greatest cosmological discovery over the last 50 years @xcite . in the background of the classical newton s theory of gravitation",
    ", this seemed to be quite an unusual and unexpected phenomenon .",
    "the reason behind this can be attributed to the fact that the classical theory does not give us any idea regarding the repulsive nature of gravity which is quite evident from the accelerated expansion of the universe . as a possible explanation to the phenomenon , scientists resorted to a mysterious negative pressure component named the dark energy . instead of competition from other counterparts such as the theory of modified gravity ,",
    "dark energy has gained popularity of the last decade .",
    "nevertheless , dark energy and modified gravity theory complements each other as is evident from literature @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that almost two - thirds of the total energy of the universe is contributed by this mysterious form of energy .",
    "the rest of the portion is occupied by dark matter with a little contribution from baryonic matter @xcite .    in the quest of a quantum gravity theory ,",
    "fischler and suskind @xcite proposed the holographic principle . in accordance with the holographic principle",
    "the the dark energy in the context of quantum gravity is known as the holographic dark energy ( hde ) .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an enlargement relationship between the infra - red ( ir ) and ultraviolet cut - offs .",
    "the relationship is basically due to the limitation set by the formation of a black hole , which establishes an upper limit for the vacuum energy , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hde density related to the uv cut - off , @xmath4 is the ir cut - off and @xmath5 is the reduced planck mass . over the years various dark energy that have been developed which remain plagued with different cosmological problems .",
    "the notable ones being the cosmic coincidence problem , fine tuning problem , etc .",
    "it must be noted that hde may provide simultaneous natural solutions to both dark energy and cosmological problems @xcite .",
    "precisely , it gives excellent solutions to the coincidence problem @xcite and the phantom crossing @xcite .",
    "the novel feature of the model is that it has reasonable agreement with the astrophysical data of cmb , sneia and galaxy redshift surveys @xcite . as",
    "a result scientists have been inclined to extend the idea of hde dark energy via various prescriptions .",
    "extensions using different cut - offs is done in the ref .",
    "@xcite and various entropy corrections have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the holographic scale denoted by @xmath4 has a direct relation with the future event horizon @xcite , the conformal age of the universe @xcite or the ricci scalar of the universe @xcite .",
    "the model taking into account the conformal age of the universe is widely known as new agegraphic dark energy ( nade ) model in literature .",
    "recently an extension to this idea has been introduced by the name of @xmath6 type hde @xcite , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the parameters associated with the chosen ir cut - off given by , @xmath9    if we consider the consistency of a hde model with a conformal - like age of the universe as the scale @xmath4 with the past inflationary phase , perhaps the direct physical motivation of proposing such characteristic scales for the @xmath10-type holographic dark energy model is still obscure . in spite of such theoretical difficulty the model",
    "has some significant advantages that propelled its survival .",
    "the model generalizes the theory with noteworthy improvements . moreover the parameters @xmath10 opens up space to fit observational data in the background of a sound theoretical framework .",
    "it is seen that various cosmological scenarios can be achieved by giving some specific values to @xmath10 .",
    "the transition of the equation of state ( eos ) across the phantom divide can easily be achieved for some particular values of @xmath10 even without the introduction of any interaction between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "similarly for suitable values of @xmath10 , all the agegraphic - like dark energy models can be recovered . for age - like holographic models , when @xmath11 it seems that dark energy behaves as the dominant ingredient in the early epochs of the universe .",
    "this implies the unification of dark energy with dark matter .",
    "but we need to introduce some mechanism that can differentiate dark energy from the dark matter state in the early epoch and help us to identify the dominating nature of dark energy in the late universe , which will ultimately drive the acceleration of the universe .",
    "an appropriate interaction between dark energy and dark matter serves the purpose .",
    "the stability of the model in the dark energy dominated era has already been confirmed . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is seen that , best - fit analysis with observational data indicates that this model with @xmath12 and small @xmath7 is more favoured and physically more viable .    from literature , we know that a suitable alternative to the concept of dark energy in justifying the late cosmic acceleration lies in the modification of the theory of gravity , i.e , modifying the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "a popular way is to use an analytic function @xmath13 in place of @xmath14 in the action , where @xmath14 is the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "the modification basically deals with the geometry of space - time and is responsible for varying its curvature . in this connection",
    "it must be noted that @xmath15 kind of theories could successfully generate inflationary scenario for the early universe @xcite .",
    "since the curvature @xmath14 decreases as the universe evolves , any inverse power of @xmath14 in the expression of @xmath1 will generate a late time accelerating universe .",
    "detailed description of @xmath1 theories can be widely found in literature @xcite .",
    "although most of the works in literature deal with the present day acceleration , yet recently some works can be found where the authors have considered the smooth transition from decelerated to an accelerated regime @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been a challenge to realize both the early time inflation and the late time acceleration from the standard @xmath1 gravity models .",
    "however in this regard some light has been thrown in ref .",
    "recently reconstruction scheme has been a very interesting topic of study in cosmology .",
    "reconstruction scheme has been studied using @xmath1 gravity on many occasions by different authors @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have discussed a reconstruction scheme of @xmath16 gravity with @xmath17-type and entropy corrected @xmath10-type hde models .",
    "motivated by this , we set to develop a reconstruction scheme between @xmath1 gravity and two types of hde models , namely the @xmath10-type hde model and entropy corrected @xmath10-type hde ( echde ) model in this assignment .    the einstein field equations in the frw model in the background of @xmath1 gravity are discussed in section @xmath18 .",

    "here we speculate that the late cosmic acceleration plays a big role in destabilizing the evolution of the universe , which is expected from general notion of dynamics . in fig.6 , for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , we see that the model exhibits a perfectly stable nature . from the above discussion",
