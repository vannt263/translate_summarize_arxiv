    "are recovered accurately and as a result we do not think that the failure of the model to decribe the full 2d shape of @xmath10 is a serious pitfall for future redshift space analyses .",
    "our results point to necessary adjustments needed in the model , such as including non - linear damping terms for example . whether the velocity power spectrum can be extracted using more complicated modelling of the 2d power spectrum , and how well it can be measured ,",
    "is left for future analysis .",
    "the second , two - part , question is which observable , @xmath10 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 etc .",
    "shows the largest difference between an @xmath0 and a gr cosmology and is the simple redshift space distortion model accurate enough to allow us to measure these differences .",

    ", we find that redshift space distortions in modified gravity models have an impact on the clustering of dark matter on large and small scales to a level which may be distinguished from general relativity .",
    "current redshift space distortion models , which are valid on quasi linear scales , are accurate enough to extract the non linear matter @xmath159 in real space from the measured 2d redshift space power spectrum on large scales , allowing us to constrain @xmath0 modified gravity .",
    "the large difference between the predicted velocity @xmath159 in the @xmath0 and gr cosmology make this a very promising observable with which to test gr provided that this can be accurately extracted from the redshift space power spectrum . for certain @xmath0 parameter values , e.g. @xmath231 ,",
    "the impact of modified gravity on both the matter and velocity fields is not significant and any deviations from gr are restricted to small scales . in a follow up paper we will examine the redshift space distortions in the clustering of halos in these modified gravity models on nonlinear scales .",
