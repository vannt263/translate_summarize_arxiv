    "it is important to ensure a relatively large minigap @xmath20 separating the majorana states from charged excitations .",

    "we study the influence of size effects on the appearance of the majorana states in a ring made of the chiral superconductor .",
    "it was noted that in finite samples of size @xmath23 there generally is present there is a _ pair _ of `` nearly ''",

    ". however these states are no longer topologically protected and naively one would expect that the degeneracy is removed with small splitting energy @xmath24@xcite due to tunneling from the core to the surface of the sample . for systems of small size @xmath25 the situation might be different . in particular it is not clear whether the splitting always occurs at all and how it depends of the sample geometry .    to investigate the survival of majorana states we calculate exactly the spectrum of excitations in the chiral superconducting ring with internal and external radii @xmath0 , @xmath1 of order @xmath2 trapping a unit flux @xmath26 ( see fig.1 ) within the bogoliubov - degennes approach .",
    "a surprising finding is that although the splitting is generally of order of the bulk energy gap @xmath13 , there exists a pair of _ precisely _ zero energy states for special relation @xmath27 for any integer @xmath28 .",

    "it should be determined self consistently , however , for a sufficiently thin homogeneous disk we initially take @xmath39 .",
    "this is justified in the bulk since the sample size is of order of @xmath2 .",
    "although the andreev s bound states are typically inhomogeneous , the effect of their inhomogeneity on the order parameter is still smaller than that of the continuum states even for small sizes shapiro11 .",
    "we will later investigate the stability of the solutions with respect to variations to @xmath37 .",
    "the equations possess the rotational and the electron - hole symmetries and eigenstates can be found in a form :    @xmath40    for any angular momentum @xmath41 and momentum along the field @xmath42 , there are radial excitation levels . in a dimensionless form eq.(bdgeqs ) is written as @xmath43with the dimensionless energy @xmath44 . here",
