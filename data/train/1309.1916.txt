    "coherent manipulation of quantum systems with time - dependent fields is a major goal in different areas , including atomic , molecular , and optical physics , as well as in semiconductor - based devices @xcite , with applications in metrology , interferometry , and quantum information processing . in all these areas , control schemes for fast state transitions",

    "a time - dependent electric field can in principle be generated on the nanoscale by local electrodes and , thus , provides individual access and efficient manipulation for each spin @xcite . by contrast , oscillating magnetic fields are not easy to generate and manipulate locally .    beyond the single dot , two - electron double quantum dots ( dqds )",

    "<S> inverse engineering of electric fields has been recently proposed to achieve fast and robust spin control in a single - electron quantum dot with spin - orbit coupling . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we design , by inverse engineering based on lewis - riesenfeld invariants , time - dependent electric fields to realize fast transitions in the selected singlet - triplet subspace of a two - electron double quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> we apply two - mode driving schemes , directly employing the lewis - riesenfeld phases , to minimize the electric field necessary to design flexible protocols and perform spin manipulation on the chosen timescale . </S>"
