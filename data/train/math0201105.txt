    "in other words , @xmath6 for some @xmath7 with @xmath8 .    in the formula above , @xmath4 line , and @xmath5 line will be called the diagonal , and the subdiagonal , respectively , and the positions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be referred to as the top at @xmath11 and the bottom at @xmath12 , thinking of the table of coefficients in which the powers of @xmath3 increase from left to right , and the powers of @xmath13 increase from top to bottom . these terms will be applied to khovanov s cohomology groups as well .",
    "we follow the convention of defining @xmath14 to be the signature of the sum of the seifert matrix of @xmath0 and its transpose , which is the negative of the signature in @xcite .    for the sign of a crossing ,",
    "we follow the convention indicated below , which is opposite to what is used in @xcite , so that @xmath15 and @xmath16 for an oriented diagram @xmath17 are the number of negative crossings and positive crossings , respectively .",
    "we follow the notations and terminologies defined in @xcite .",
    "consult @xcite for undefined terminologies and notations .",
    "let @xmath17 be a link diagram , which is a regular projection of a link together with the information of relative height at each double point . for brevity of the statements to follow ,",
    "let s think of the diagram on @xmath19 rather than @xmath20 .",
    "the regions of @xmath19 divided by @xmath17 can be colored black and white in checkerboard fashion .    at each crossing",
    ", a coloring of the nearby regions falls into one of the two following patterns .",
    "@xmath21    if @xmath17 is alternating , then adjacent crossings have the same coloring pattern .",
    "@xmath22    thus , in a coloring of a non - split alternating diagram @xmath17 , only one of the pattern a or b appears for every crossing .",

    "the trace of each crossing lies in a white region .",
    "now , our claim is :    [ prop : goodd ] for a reduced non - split alternating diagram @xmath17 , the components of @xmath24 bound non - overlapping black disks in the coloring of it .",
    "each black disk corresponds to each of the black regions in the coloring of @xmath17 .",
