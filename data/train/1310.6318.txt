    "there has been rapid progress in understanding the accretion processes in astrophysics during the past three decades .",
    "today we know that the accretion disks exist in many astrophysical systems such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and in close x - ray binary systems ( xbs ) where the accretion disk surrounds a black hole .",
    "many theoretical models have been proposed .",
    "one of them is the standard accretion disk model presented by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the disk is assumed to be geometrically thin ( @xmath10 ) , optically thick in the vertical direction and the accreting matter moves with nearly keplerian velocity .",
    "this model explains most of the observational features of x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei in a highly convincing manner .",
    "however , standard disk models can not reproduce high energy emissions , such as x - ray and gamma rays spectrum .",
    "one of the most important processes that is not considered in the standard accretion disk model is advective cooling . in this model",
    ", the accreting matter cools so efficiently that all of the energy released through viscosity can be locally radiated .",
    "however , there exist distinct branches of steady disk solutions in which this assumption is violated . in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( hereafter riaf ) ,",
    "the energy released via viscosity is stored as entropy and transported inward with accretion .",
    "so the flow becomes very hot and produces high energy emissions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "in the case of low mass accretion rate , @xmath11 , it is expected to have optically thin advection dominated accretion flow ( adafs / riaf ) with insufficient cooling ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1995a , 1995b ; @xcite ) .",
    "the adafs were adopted to the low / hard state of black hole binaries and low - luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , such as the supermassive black hole in the center of our galactic ( sgr @xmath12 .",
    "if the accretion rate is mildly low @xmath13 , the disk is in the shakura & sunyaev standard state ( ssd ) , that the disk is geometrically thin and optically thick .",
    "the ssd model can be applied to the high / soft state of black hole binaries and even for luminous agns .",
    "moreover if the mass accretion rate is very high @xmath14 , the disk is categorized as a super critical state ( slim disk ) , that the disk is optically and geometrically thick . this bright branch may be applied to the very high state of black hole binaries and super eddington sources .",
    "the adafs models have captured great attention and rapid progress has been made in this field .",
    "an extensive discussion on advection dominated accretion disk began by @xcite , 1995a , 1995b .",
    "they solved the disk structure along @xmath2 direction using self - similar method in radial direction .",
    "moreover , several numerical simulations ( hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical ) have been performed to study the structure of adafs ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this model have been used to interpret the spectra of black hole x - ray binaries in their quiescent or low / hard state as an alternative to the @xcite ( sle ) solutions .",
    "since adafs have large radial velocities , accreting matter carries the thermal energy into the black hole .",
    "thus , the advective energy transport will act against thermal instability .",
    "it caused adafs have been widely used for explaining the observations of galactic black hole candidates ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , the spectral transition of cyg x-1 ( @xcite ) and multi - wavelength spectral properties of sgr @xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "many adaf - like models have been proposed including outflows , convection , etc . in this regard , the luminous hot accretion flow",
    "( lhaf ) model by @xcite is a development of adaf to higher accretion rates .",
    "moreover , the convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ) model ( @xcite , @xcite ) proposes that accretion flows are convectively unstable .",
    "in addition the adiabatic inflow - outflow solution ( adios ) model is an additional development that is suggested by @xcite , 2004 . but",
    "recently @xcite simulations have shown that the convection model is not a complete model to explain outflow .",
    "it has been observationally verified that some of the angular momentum is dissipated outwards in an accretion disk by outflows in the form of wind or jets , from such systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these outflows , which characteristically cause the loss of angular momentum , mass and thermal energy , are classified as winds or jets based on their collimation . however , this classification is not exactly clear because of some observed systems both types of outflows ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these kinds of outflows are seen in all sorts of objects from microquasars , ysos , agns etc .",
    ", which is a good indication of the range of scales involved in this phenomena .",
    "the cause of these outflows is the accretion mechanism itself , so it is imperative to understand this mechanism particularly at earlier stages when most of matter is accreted by a central object",
    ".    it is found that the rate of the mass loss is proportional to the disk size and mass of the central object possibly by a power - law dependence ( @xcite ) . from the first star formation models which considered the accretion flow without wind , it was found that mass accretion is constant @xmath16 , as the collapse proceeds inside - out at local sound speeds .",
    "however as a result of outflows , the accretion rate varies with radius as a power - law , with the power - law index of an order of unity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , 2013 ; @xcite ) . in the earlier phases of star formation",
    ", accretion rate is very high ( @xmath17 ) and the mass loss in the system is in the form of winds , with the mass loss rate being @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "what exactly drives these winds is still not very clear .",
    "the emission mechanism of disk winds relies on a variety of physical phenomena such as the effects of magnetic fields , electric fields generated by the relative separation between ions and electrons , electron - positron pairs production and their coupling with the radiation field in the disk winds , etc .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "adafs solutions predict a high temperature for accretion material .",
    "consequently the gas is ionized which will be affected by the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field therefore plays an important role in the dynamics of accretion flows and probably in creating of outflow , wind or jet .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; 2008 ; 2010 ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have tried to solve the magnetohydrodynamics equations of magnetized adafs analytically .",
    "they showed that the presence of a magnetic field and its associated resistivity can considerably change the picture with regard to accretion flows .",
    "as it was mentioned , narayan & yi used self- similar method in radial direction and solved the disk structure along @xmath2 direction . the self - similar approach adopted by narayan & yi 1995",
    "is only partially supported by numerical simulations , i.e. , there exist a new class of accretion flow , which is hot and optically thin and it is advection - dominated . on the other hand ,",
    "their shortcoming is also obvious , i.e. the lack of an outflow .",
    "thus , it is not consistent with the new developments in hot accretion flow theory .",
    "also recent theoretical work ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) and numerical simulations ( stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; stone & pringle 2001 , de villiers , hawley , krolik & hirose 2005 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2011 , yuan et al .",
    "2012a , 2012b ) indicates that outflow is commonly observed to be associated with the hot accretion flow .",
    "more importantly , there are compelling observational evidences for the existence of outflow in hot accretion systems , e.g. our galactic center and ngc 3115 ( see xie & yuan 2012 for a short summary ) .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations indicate that @xmath19 is non - zero ( see stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2011 ; yuan , bu & wu 2012 ) . besides",
    ", numerical calculations indicate that , it is very difficult to find an outflow solution with @xmath20 ( narayan & yi 1995 ) , whereas with nonzero @xmath19 outflow can be found ( e.g. xue & wang 2004 ) and @xmath21 will be positive .",
    "recently @xcite have solved a set of hydrodynamical equations for accretion disks in the spherical coordinates ( @xmath22 ) and obtained the explicit structure along the @xmath23 direction .",
    "they assumed @xmath24 and used a self - similar treatment that leads to an accretion - outflow solution for adafs . the adafs solutions with wind",
    "were reported previously by @xcite , 2010 , @xcite where the effects of wind and outflow are achieved by adding relevant terms in mhd equations .",
    "it means that outflow will appear by a power - law assumption in mhd equations .",
    "@xcite solutions show that when we assume @xmath25 by adopting proper boundary condition self - similar solution it will lead to constant inflow - outflow behavior . in this manuscript we will try to develop @xcite solutions by adding a toroidal magnetic field and its correspond resistivity using self - similar method .",
    "recent numerical simulations support that the mass accretion rate , radial velocity and density can be well approximated as power - laws ( see , e.g. stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; yuan , bu & wu 2012 ) .",
    "all of these power - law profiles are consistent with the self - similar methodology adopted in our work .",
    "although , the existence of a self - similar solution in no way guarantees that this solution is relevant to real accretion flows ( particularly near to boundaries ) , it is nevertheless likely to provide a good indication of how realistic flows will behave .",
    "the structure of this paper organized as follow . in section 2 , we describe basic equations and give a self - similar solution in redial direction corresponding to adafs model .",
    "boundary conditions are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we show the numerical results and discuss the variation and the physical meaning of each parameter from equatorial plane to the surface of the disk .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "in this section we derive the basic equations of optically thin advection dominated accretion flows under magnetohydrodynamics approximation and in a non - relativistic regime .",
    "we neglect the effect of self - gravity in our model .",
    "the magnetic field is considered with toroidal configurations and in addition to relativistic effects being ignored , we have used newtonian gravity .",
    "the disk is supposed to be turbulent and possess an effective turbulent viscosity .",
    "@xmath26-prescription for viscosity was adopted .",
    "we have assumed that the energy generated due to viscosity and magnetic resistivity is balanced by a combination of radiative and advective cooling .",
    "thus , the resistive mhd equation are involved in continuity equation , equation of motion , energy equation and induction equation that can be respectively written as follows : @xmath27 = q_{+ } - q_{-}\\equiv q_{adv }   \\label{energy_main}\\\\      \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}}{\\partial t } = \\mathbf{\\nabla}\\times \\big ( \\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{b } - \\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\eta \\mathbf{j } \\big ) \\label{induction_main}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in the above mhd equations , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mass density , velocity vector , gravitational potential , pressure , magnetic field , current density , and the tensor of viscous stress , respectively . here , @xmath35 .",
    "we adopt spherical coordinate @xmath0 to solve these equation .",
    "we consider the newtonian potential , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the gravitational constant , @xmath38 is the central object mass and @xmath39 is the spherical radial coordinate . in our calculation , we use only the @xmath40-component of the viscous stress tensor , which is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the kinematic viscosity coefficient and will be defined later . in the energy equation",
    ", @xmath43 is the internal energy that can be expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ratio of specific heats and is considered as a constant input parameter . on the right hand site of energy equation",
    "we have @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the advection transfer of energy , @xmath48 shows the energy loss through radiative cooling and @xmath49 represent the dissipation rate of heating due to viscosity and resistivity , @xmath50 , which can be defined as @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the magnetic diffusivity parameter .",
    "@xmath54 is the hitting rate due to the resistance of fluid against the motion of charges . in other words",
    ", @xmath54 is the joule hitting or resistivity hitting , that is equal to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the electric field in the co - moving frame .",
    "we consider that @xmath42 and @xmath53 have the same units and for both of them use the general case @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the magnetic pressure , @xmath59 is the keplerian angular speed and also @xmath60 and @xmath61 are positive constants less than 1 .",
    "thus , the right hand side of energy equation will be @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the advection parameter which is defined by @xcite .",
    "although , this parameter varies with radius @xmath39 , and depends on the heating and cooling processes , we consider it as a constant here .",
    "we fix @xmath65 all over this manuscript . for simplicity",
    ", the flow is assumed to be steady and axisymmetic @xmath66 .",
    "we also consider toroidal component of magnetic field , @xmath67 .",
    "most of the simulations in accretion disks show the toroidal component for magnetic field is enhanced because of rotating disk .",
    "we can say utilizing the toroidal component is a right choice in the physics of accretion processes .",

    "in fact , these partial differential equations are converted into ordinary differential equations by using the assumption of radial self - similarity .",
    "although it must be investigated if there are any critical points or not .",
    "self - similar method is one of the most useful and powerful techniques for solving differential equations . by this method",
    ", we can solve a set of coupled differential equations analytically or semi - analytically .",
    "the disk equations reduce from partial to ordinary differential equations under the assumption of radial self - similarity , which implies that all quantities are described by power - laws in the spherical radius @xmath39 for a fixed inclination angle .",
    "this assumption is widely used in the literature of black hole accretion disks ( see narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 , akizuki & fukue 2006 , kato et al .",
    "the self - similar scaling for density and velocities has a very good agreement with recent numerical simulations of accretion disk ( stone , pringle & begelman 1999 , de villiers et al 2005 , beckwith et al .",
    "2008 , yuan et al 2012 ) .",
    "generally self - similar solutions are divided into two chief categories : temporal self - similar answers and spacial self- similar answers . because the equations of the system depend on time",
    ", we can search for answers that describe the temporal change of physical quantities in a way that the change of each quantity at any instant of time is similar to the others .",
    "but the second type is the spatially self - similar solutions which are used in this paper .",
    "essentially the spatially self - similar solutions are described the behavior of physical quantities in a manner that at any distance from the center of the system , the difference with the other points are only in a constant factor . as a result ,",
    "these answers have power functions of positions usually .",
    "so we solve a set of equations which depend on @xmath74 .",
    "thus our self - similar solutions must be in the form of @xmath74 .",
    "physical quantities are assumed as unknown powers of @xmath74 .",

    "also there must be a @xmath3 at a particular point where the radial velocity is equal to zero @xmath5 and after this bending point , the inflow material is deflected to outflow .",
    "hence we can define the inflow region , where the inflow of the matter is directed toward the central mass and has a negative value , @xmath117 and the outflow region where radial velocity has a positive value , @xmath118 . according to @xcite and @xcite",
    "the mass inflow and outflow rates can be written as @xmath119\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] based on the above equation , mass density is function of @xmath39 and only when @xmath120 the mass density becomes independent of radius .",
    "also , if the outflow rate equals the inflow rate of material at a certain radius , the second law of thermodynamics is violated ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the role of magnetic field parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and also @xmath121 , @xmath26 and @xmath45 parameters on the vertical structure of accretion disks and basic dynamical quantities of our model .",
    "as previously mentioned , we have a positive value for the radial velocity of accretion material , @xmath83 .",
    "in fact this positive value indicates that the fluid is moving away from the central massive accretor and this phenomenon will escalate with the decrease of @xmath2 and also moves towards the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "indeed , due to the very low density around vertical axis , @xmath122 , numerical errors will appear and we have to finish our calculation at this angle .",
    "therefore , this point is considered as the surface of the accretion disk . in other words , as is expressed in previous works ( @xcite ) , according to the sign of the radial velocity , three different regions are distinguished in an accretion disk .",
    "one is the predominate region which is called the inflow region and starts from midplane and continues to where the radial velocity equals zero ( @xmath5 ) . here",
    "@xmath3 indicates the angle at which the radial velocity is zero .",
    "actually in the interval @xmath123 the accretion flow moves towards the massive accretor .",
    "for this reason it is called the inflow region and it is obvious that accretion rate will be negative there .",
    "the next area that has been located just after the inflow region and continues to the surface of the disk is called the outflow region . in this area ,",
    "the value of the radial velocity is positive meaning that the accretion flow is moving away from the central accretor .",
    "this region is not very wide and as it is anticipated by calculation of mass accretion rate in this area , this rate is less than unity and this does not violate the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "also a large fraction of accretion flow at a certain radius inclines towards the massive accretor and does not escape from the disk by wind or outflow ( see @xcite ; @xcite for more details ) .",
    "finally , the third region is called the wind region ; a very narrow area which is located between the surface of the disk and the vertical axis and we do not have many information about this area because the self - similar solution has some drawback .        figure .  [ vrs ] , shows the role of magnetic field parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , viscosity parameter @xmath26 and density index @xmath121 on the radial velocity of the accretion flow along @xmath2 direction .",
    "other fixed parameters are mentioned at the top of each panel . in the top left panel , the radial velocity along @xmath2 direction",
    "is seen with different values of @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath8 demonstrates the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure in the equatorial plane . according to the fig .",
    "[ vrs ] , @xmath8 does not have any effect on the inflow region and it only changes the outflow value",
    ". it is seen that if the magnetic pressure is increased , the area of the outflow region is decreased ( the small value of @xmath8 shows high value for magnetic pressure ) .",
    "this implies that toroidal component of magnetic field prevents material from the surface of disk .",

    "the top right panel of this figure shows the role of different values of @xmath9 on radial velocity along @xmath2 direction . as shown in this panel , unlike the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure in midplane , the magnetic diffusivity parameter , @xmath9 , increases in the outflow region . actually , radial velocity will be more positive in this region , but there is not any special effect on the thickness and inflow region",
    ". the bottom left panel contains different values of viscosity parameter , @xmath26 .",

    "the bottom right panel is plotted for different values of density index , @xmath121 .",
    "the anticipated value of @xmath121 is smaller than unity ( yuan et al . 2012 ( i , ii ) ) .",
    "this panel shows an increase in the outflow region and thickness by increasing density parameter which is in full agreement with previously studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have improved the results of the previous works by considering the toroidal component of magnetic field .",
    "therefore , these results are very closer to reality .    in fig .",

    "the equatorial plane is zero , i.e. @xmath130 . also the variations of the second component of velocity vector is nonzero , @xmath131 . as a result of this symmetry ,",
    "the fluid is just directed to the central object in midplane and then by moving towards the vertical axis we can see that the direction of material becomes inverse and is inclined towards the surface of the disk .",
    "this is because the radial velocity of accretion flow is positive which has been considered in previous works ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an important issue is sup - keplerian velocity .",
    "in fact all three components of velocity in all angles have smaller values than keplerian .",

    "the interesting and new behavior are related to magnetic pressure variations based on @xmath2 . as shown in this panel magnetic pressure increases as the angle decreases by motion toward surface of disk . actually by taking this symmetry assumption on the equatorial plane of the disk and the positive sign for second derivation of magnetic field at this point , @xmath132",
    ", it is due to the fact that the minimum value for magnetic field is in the equatorial plane , meaning that an increase of field as @xmath2 falling down is not far from reality . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic field on the disk surface is an important parameter for determining the behavior and structure of the disk .",

    "[ variables_beta0 ] shows the effect of various values of magnetic field parameter @xmath8 on the profiles of the physical variables . as it is stated before",
    ", @xmath8 is the ratio of gas to the magnetic pressure in the midplane of the disk .",

    "also the thickness of the disk will decrease too .",
    "moreover according to middle profiles of figure .",
    "[ variables_beta0 ] it is predicted that the mass density and gas pressure decrease along @xmath2 direction toward surface of the disk .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic pressure enhance and become strong near surface of the disk by increasing of @xmath8 .",
    "the identical behavior is shown in profile of @xmath88 in the below row of figure .",
    "[ variables_beta0 ] .",
    "moreover when we move toward surface the variation of magnetic field will reduce .",

    "[ variables_eta0 ] is dedicated to variations of the magnetic field and also ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure . by looking at these figures",
    "we can conclude that @xmath9 parameter does not have any shift on inflow region also it change the outflow area . as a result due to the symmetry considered in equatorial plane previously mentioned we can see an increase in the magnetic field from equatorial plane to the disk surface .",
    "the variation of magnetic field will increase by increasing @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , a decrease in the quantity @xmath113 can be seen by decreasing angle which reflects the fact that while moving towards the disk gas pressure is reduced and magnetic pressure will increase and the result of this process of reducing in the value of @xmath113 will be in motion to vertical axis .",

    "the initial value of radial velocity at the equatorial plane reduces with @xmath45 and actually it will be much more negative than before which represents the inflow region will be increases . moreover",
    "this parameter will make the @xmath84 component of velocity negative and also will have a significant reduction in the rotational speed of the accretion flows . according to the diagram the magnetic pressure and the magnetic field",
    "are observed these quantities with increasing parameter @xmath45 will be increases in the moving disk surface increases .",
    "the panels of variations of field and the ratio of pressures will decreases as @xmath45 decreases .    on principle this value must be smaller than the unity in order to not violate the second law of thermodynamics . figure .",

    "fixed parameters corresponding to each of the graphs are listed at the top of each ones .",
    "the top left panel shows the ratio of outflow accretion over inflow accretion depending on different values of @xmath146 between @xmath148 .",
    "as previously mentioned if @xmath8 decreases it shows the strong effect of magnetic field at the start point i.e. , in the equatorial plate . then according this panel",
    "it can be argued reduce the magnetic field is increased , the proportion . also this rate is smaller than unit which expresses most of the material increases toward to accretor and only a fraction of that moves out of disk ,",
    "finally out be a form of wind and jet . in the top right panel the ratio of accretion rates to @xmath149 is also shown . a very interesting point in this diagram",
    "is that the @xmath9 parameter only increases at outflow boundary and does not have a significant effect on inflow .",
    "now from this information it can be inferred that increasing the value of @xmath146 in the interval between @xmath150 has been dramatic and the interval @xmath151 behavior of charts are fixed .",
    "the bottom left panel also shows the behavior of mass accretion rates to variation of viscosity parameter , @xmath26 .",
    "we also considered the interval @xmath152 for @xmath26 , because it is in adaptation with observations .",
    "we see a double behavior of viscosity parameter .",
    "in fact , at first we see the proportion of outflow ratio to inflow ratio . around the @xmath153 this increasing trend",
    "has stopped and the @xmath154 interval reduction in the diagram will be done . as a result",
    "we will see the peak of the figure near @xmath153 .",
    "this effect has also been seen by @xcite paper about adafs , figure 17 , and for more information you can be refer to this article .",
    "finally , the bottom right of figure .",
    "[ figmdot ] shows the behavior of ratio mass accretion rates to variation of mass density power - law index , @xmath121 .",
    "this can be understood by referring to previous figures because we are seeing an increase in the ratio of outflow rate to inflow rate along @xmath121 , then mass density parameter , @xmath121 , will be increase the outflow boundary that is in perfect harmony by fig [ variables_beta0 ] . according to the last simulation works , we have considered smaller range than previous one , i.e. , @xmath155 .",
    "this increasing trend has also been observed in figure 17 of @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this manuscript is verifying the structure of advection dominated accretion flows @xmath156 along the @xmath23 direction when bathed in a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the results have shown that the vertical structure of the disks is significantly affected by the magnetic field and its correspond resistivity . by the self - similar solution along radial direction , the proper boundary conditions and reflection symmetry in equatorial plane of the disk , we have constructed the structure of the disk along the @xmath23 direction explicitly .",
    "we have shown that only by assuming @xmath157 the solutions represent a inflow - outflow behavior which is not reported in the pervious adafs investigations .",
    "this assumption improved @xcite solution to interpret the existence of outflow in the hot accreting systems .",
    "our disk consists of three different regions : 1- predominate region which is called the inflow region .",
    "it start up from midplane to where the radial velocity is equal zero , @xmath5 and contains the largest portion of mass .",
    "2- an outflow region which located just after the inflow region and will continue to the surface of the disk in which the matter starts escaping the central accretor in the @xmath158-direction .",
    "3- the third region , called wind region .",
    "this region contains the material blowing out from the boundary of the outflow region . an area with very low wide and",
    "since the self - similar solution has some drawback , we do not have many information about it .",
    "compared to the nonmagnetic field solution @xcite , the existence of magnetic field and it s resistivity in our case , can produce more advective energy .",
    "also , the b - field configuration can affect the energy transportation along accretion disks .",
    "in this paper we used two parameters @xmath145 , @xmath146 in order to study the effect of magnetic field on the vertical structure of the disk .",
    "our results shown that the magnetic pressure will increase if @xmath23 changes moving towards the surface of disc . also if we increase the @xmath145 parameter ( which represents the ratio of gas pressure to field pressure at @xmath159 ) it will enhance the rate of magnetic pressure growth ( figure 3 ) .",
    "moreover , it was demonstrated that the disc s half width declines as @xmath145 increases ( figure 3 ) .    in a real accretion disk ,",
    "there are several important processes other than viscosity and resistivity which they are also expected to have influenced on the dynamical structure of the disks such as radiation pressure , photon trapping and any types of instabilities .",
    "it is immediately clear that the changes in the boundary conditions affect the structure of the solutions and also it should be emphasized that we obtained this solution in a steady state regime .",
    "thus , the mere existence of a self - similar solution in no way guarantees that the solution is relevant to real accretion flows . given these facts ,",
    "the treatments in the paper are very simplified , however sufficiently general to describe many disk / outflow systems .",
    "although we have made some simplifications in order to treat the problem analytically , the presented self - similar solutions shown that the input parameters can really change the typical behavior of the physical quantities of adaf disks .",
    "besides , numerical simulations support that the mass accretion rate , radial velocity and density can be well approximated as power - laws ( see , e.g. stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; yuan , bu & wu 2012 ) .",
    "all these power - law profiles justify the self - similar methodology adopted in our work . although these self - similar solutions are too simple to make any comparison with observations , however , we think that one may relax the self - similarity assumptions and solve the equations of the model numerically . this kind of similarity solution could greatly facilitate testing and interpretation of the results .",
