    "@xmath4 is a set of @xmath2 dots in a square grid , with the property that the lines joining distinct pairs of dots are all different in length or slope .",
    "for instance , the dots depicted in the following array form a @xmath5 : @xmath6 if we pick a position on the square grid to be the origin , we may think of the dots in a @xmath4 as a set @xmath7 of vectors in @xmath8 .",
    "the condition that the dots form a @xmath4 is then the same as the condition that the _ difference vectors _ @xmath9 with @xmath10 are all distinct .",
    "so we may think of the dots in the example above as the set @xmath11 of vectors ; it is easy to verify that the six difference vectors are all different in this case .",
    "many special classes of distinct difference configurations have been studied previously : these include @xmath12 sequences over @xmath13 and golomb rulers in the one - dimensional case , and costas arrays , golomb rectangles and sonar sequences in the two - dimensional case .",
    "see  @xcite for a summary of these configurations .",
    "this paper is concerned with the _ @xmath1-hop properties _ of distinct difference configurations .",
    "before we explain this , we first need to discuss an application to key predistribution in grid - based wireless sensor networks due to blackburn , etzion , martin and paterson @xcite that motivates our work .",
    "a _ wireless sensor network _ is a large collection of small sensor nodes that are equipped with wireless communication capability .",
    "sensor nodes have limited communication range and thus data transmitted over the network is typically passed from node to node in a series of _ hops _ in order to reach its end destination .",
    "such networks can be employed for a wide range of applications @xcite , whether scientific , commercial , humanitarian or military .",
    "the data being transmitted over the wireless medium is frequently valuable or sensitive ; hence , there is a need for cryptographic techniques to provide data integrity , confidentiality and authentication .",
    "on deployment , the sensor nodes aim to form a secure and connected network .",
    "in other words , we desire a significant proportion of nodes within communication range to share cryptographic keys .",
    "the nodes size limits their computational power and battery capacity , so it is assumed that the sensor nodes are unable to use public key cryptography to establish shared keys .",
    "so symmetric cryptographic keys are preloaded onto each node before deployment : methods for deciding which keys are assigned to a node are known as key predistribution schemes ( see  @xcite for surveys of this subject ) .",
    "the sensor nodes are assumed to be highly vulnerable to compromise , so a single key should not be given to too many nodes .",
    "a balancing constraint is that each node can only store a limited number of keys .",
    "the aim is to design an efficient and secure key predistribution scheme so that a sensor node can establish secure wireless links with many of its neighbours : it is important to establish as many short secure links in the network as possible , since the nodes capacity to relay information is very limited .",
    "key predistribution schemes for wireless sensor networks generally assume that the precise location of nodes is not known before deployment , hence schemes such as @xcite aim to provide reasonable levels of `` average '' connectivity across the entire network .",
    "however in many applications the location of sensor nodes can be determined prior to deployment . in such cases",
    "this knowledge can be used to improve the efficiency of the underlying key predistribution scheme .",
    "one such scenario is that of networks consisting of a large number of sensor nodes arranged in a square grid .",
    "grid - based networks can arise in many applications , including soil moisture sensing @xcite , monitoring conditions in an orchard @xcite , and measuring the efficiency of water use during irrigation @xcite .      in  @xcite a key predistribution scheme for a grid - based network was proposed and analysed .",
    "this scheme was shown to be significantly more efficient than using general approaches such as that of @xcite .",
    "we now discuss this scheme in more detail .    although the number of sensor nodes is evidently finite in practice , it is convenient to model the physical location of the nodes by the set of points of @xmath0 .",
    "the scheme in @xcite employs a distinct difference configuration to create a key predistribution scheme in the following way .",
    "[ bempscheme ] let @xmath14 be a distinct difference configuration .",
    "allocate keys to nodes as follows :    * label each node with its position in @xmath0 . * for every ` shift ' @xmath15 , generate a key @xmath16 and assign @xmath16 to the nodes labelled by @xmath17 , for @xmath18 .",
    "more informally , we can think of the scheme as covering @xmath8 with all possible translations of the dots in @xmath19 .",
    "we generate one key per translation , and assign that key to all dots in the corresponding translation of @xmath19 . distributing keys in this manner ensures that each node stores @xmath2 keys and each key is shared by @xmath2 nodes .",
    "in addition , the distinct difference property of the configuration implies that any pair of nodes shares at most one key , since the vector representing the difference in two nodes positions can occur at most once as a difference vector of @xmath19 .",
    "this leads to an efficient distribution of keys , since for a fixed number of stored keys the number of distinct pairs of nodes that share a key is maximised .    as an example , consider the distinct difference configuration given at the start of this introduction .",
    "if we use this configuration for key distribution in scheme  [ bempscheme ] , each node stores three keys .",
    "figure  [ costasex ] illustrates this key distribution : each square in the grid represents a node , and each symbol contained in a square represents a key possessed by that node .",
    "the central square stores keys marked by the letters @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; two further nodes share each of these keys , which are marked in bold .",
    "letters in standard type represent keys used to connect the central node to one of its neighbours via a two - hop path , other keys are marked in grey . note that we have only illustrated some of the keys",
    "; the pattern of key sharing extends in a similar manner throughout the entire network .",
    "see  @xcite for a comparison of how scheme  [ bempscheme ] outperforms related key predistribution schemes in the literature .",

    "a number of distinct difference configurations with good two - hop coverage were found by computer search . however no concrete construction techniques were provided . in this paper",
    "we provide an exposition of the two - hop coverage case , as well as consider the generalisation to @xmath1-hop coverage .",

    "[ sec : max ] we study configurations where @xmath44 is as large as possible , and show a connection between such configurations and @xmath47 sequences ( a well studied concept in combinatorial number theory ) .",
    "we determine the maximum value of the @xmath1-hop coverage @xmath44 where @xmath19 is a @xmath4 ( or a @xmath35 ) , and show that @xmath19 achieves this level of @xmath1-hop coverage if and only if @xmath19 is a @xmath48 sequence . if we restrict @xmath19 to be a @xmath34 for some small integer @xmath33 , we might no longer be able to achieve this maximum value of @xmath44 : we provide bounds on the smallest value of @xmath33 for which there exists a configuration @xmath19 which is a @xmath34 with @xmath44 maximal .",

    "finally , in subsection  [ sec : min ] , we provide a lower bound on @xmath44 and characterise those configurations that meet this lower bound .    using a distinct difference configuration with maximal @xmath1-hop coverage ensures that as many users as possible are connected by @xmath1-hop paths .",
    "however , in many applications these paths are used to establish keys which are later used for direct communication between the two end nodes : thus we are only interested in @xmath1-hop paths whose start and end nodes are within communication range . for these applications , rather than optimising the total number of pairs of users connected by @xmath1-hop paths we wish to optimise coverage in a locally defined region : we say that a @xmath4 or @xmath35 achieves _",
    "complete @xmath1-hop coverage with respect to a region @xmath27 and point @xmath49 _ if every point in @xmath27 can be reached by a two - hop path from  @xmath50 .",
    "this means that every node @xmath51 can communicate via a @xmath1-hop path with the nodes in the region corresponding to a shift of @xmath27 that moves @xmath50 to @xmath51 , giving scheme  [ bempscheme ] good local connectivity . in section  [ sec : complete - two - hop ] we give a construction for a @xmath4 that achieves complete two - hop coverage with respect to the centre of a @xmath52 rectangle when @xmath53 is prime .",

    "a hexagonal distinct difference configuration can be used in scheme  [ bempscheme ] for sensors arranged in a hexagonal grid , provided that shifts @xmath59 are used : as in the square grid , every node is assigned @xmath2 keys and the distinct difference property implies that any pair of nodes has at most one key in common .",

    "<S> a distinct difference configuration is a set of points in @xmath0 with the property that the vectors ( _ difference vectors _ ) connecting any two of the points are all distinct . many specific examples of these configurations have been previously studied : the class of distinct difference configurations includes both costas arrays and sonar sequences , for example .    motivated by an application of these structures in key predistribution for wireless sensor networks , we define the @xmath1-hop coverage of a distinct difference configuration to be the number of distinct vectors that can be expressed as the sum of @xmath1 or fewer difference vectors . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important parameter when distinct difference configurations are used in the wireless sensor application , as this parameter describes the density of nodes that can be reached by a short secure path in the network . </S>",
    "<S> we provide upper and lower bounds for the @xmath1-hop coverage of a distinct difference configuration with @xmath2 points , and exploit a connection with @xmath3 sequences to construct configurations with maximal @xmath1-hop coverage . </S>",
    "<S> we also construct distinct difference configurations that enable all small vectors to be expressed as the sum of two of the difference vectors of the configuration , an important task for local secure connectivity in the application .    </S>",
