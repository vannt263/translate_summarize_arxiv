    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) is the scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the hot plasma bound to massive clusters of galaxies .",
    "this scattering results in a spectral distortion of the cmb , observable at wavelengths from the radio to the sub - mm . at frequencies lower than @xmath5ghz ,",
    "the sze is observed as a decrement in the temperature of the cmb towards massive clusters of galaxies . because the sze surface brightness of distant clusters is independent of redshift , radio surveys have the potential to be a particularly powerful method of locating distant galaxy clusters . in low density universes",
    ", clusters are presently not evolving rapidly and should exist relatively unchanged to high redshift .",
    "the ability of cluster number counts , especially at high redshift , to distinguish between different cosmological models has been extensively discussed ; for example see barbosa ( 1998 ) .",
    "significant detections of the sze have been obtained for dozens of x - ray and optically selected clusters ( see @xcite for a review ) . historically , the sensitivity and sky coverage of radio surveys have not been sufficient to allow the detection of unknown clusters through their sz signal .",
    "however , recent advances in detector technology and observing strategy have placed the goal of using the sze to search for distant unknown clusters within reach .",
    "recently , two groups working with sensitive interferometers have claimed the detection of significant small angular scale decrements in the cmb which are not in the direction of known clusters of galaxies .",
    "these detections , if they were due to very distant clusters , would be of profound cosmological significance ( @xcite ) . the lack of supporting evidence for low redshift clusters in the direction of the claimed decrements , and the difficulty of reconciling very high redshift clusters with favored cosmological models , have prompted several authors to propose alternative explanations for the decrements ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have observed fields containing each of the claimed decrements with the bima interferometer , configured with sensitive @xmath2ghz receivers , in an attempt to confirm the detections . in this work ,",
    "we review the previous observations of these fields and explore the constraints that the bima results place on the explanation of the observed decrements being due to the sze in distant clusters .",
    "the ryle telescope has been used by jones ( 1997 ) to image the surroundings of a number of radio quiet quasars at a frequency of @xmath0ghz .",
    "the deepest of these images was towards the @xmath6 quasar pair pc 1643 + 4631a , b .",
    "the cleaned map , containing baselines from @xmath7 , had a _",
    "rms _ noise of @xmath8jy in a @xmath9 beam and was used to search for point sources .",
    "three point sources with flux densities of @xmath10jy , @xmath11jy , and @xmath12jy were detected and cleaned from the visibility data .",
    "when only baselines shorter than @xmath13 were included , the east - west configuration of the ryle telescope , produced a north - south elongated beam @xmath14 .",
    "they find an essentially unresolved decrement in the resulting map of @xmath15jy centered at @xmath16 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the authors interpret their signal as being due to the sze in a massive cluster of galaxies .",
    "modeling the emission by a spherical king model , @xmath17 with @xmath18 , they find a minimum value for the central temperature decrement of @xmath19k , with a corresponding angular core radius of @xmath20 .",
    "the rosat pspc is sensitive to x - rays in the energy range @xmath21kev , and is therefore well suited to the study of high redshift clusters .",
    "one of the last observations of the rosat pspc was used to search for the x - ray radiation that would be expected from a massive cluster capable of producing the pc1643 + 4631 cmb decrement ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total time of exposure was @xmath22ks . within a @xmath23 circular aperture around the reported position of the central decrement",
    ", there were only 13 counts compared to expected background of 15 .",
    "this result was used to place a limit on the bolometric flux , @xmath24 at @xmath25 confidence . with these results , kneissl , sunyaev , & white ( 1997 ) established a conservative lower limit on the redshift of any isothermal object with temperature between @xmath26 and @xmath27kev and capable of producing the observed sze decrement , of @xmath28 .",
    "open models of the universe with @xmath29 predict only one cluster on the entire sky with redshift @xmath30 and mass @xmath31 .",
    "the field for the radio observations was originally selected by jones ( 1997 ) due to the presence of two radio quiet quasars",
    "pc1643 + 4631a , b with redshifts @xmath32 separated by @xmath33 .",
    "it was suggested by saunders ( 1997 ) that , despite the difference in redshift , the two quasars might be gravitationally lensed images of the same object . if correct , this system would be the largest separation lensed multiple image yet discovered .",
    "the x - ray results place any candidate for producing the sze signal at too high a redshift to produce such lensing and another closer lensing mass of @xmath34 would be necessary .",
    "the field of pc1643 + 4631 has been extensively searched for an excess of faint galaxies which might be expected to be associated with a distant cluster . using the lack of excess galaxies , saunders ( 1997 ) constrained the redshift of any cluster to be @xmath35 .",
    "this limit was revised downward somewhat by cotter ( 1998b ) , who used simulations to show that a cluster at redshift @xmath36 would be difficult to locate in the pc1643 + 4631 field .",
    "deep uvr imaging is an efficient means to find @xmath37 galaxies .",
    "multicolor imaging has been used to place limits on the surface density number of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath38 in the direction of pc1643 + 4631 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these papers claim a @xmath39 excess of galaxies over the number expected from the work of steidel ( 1998 ) although , as they point out , the number of objects leading to this result is small .",
    "ferreras ( 1998 ) have imaged the region surrounding pc1643 + 4631a in the uvr bands .",
    "the corner of their @xmath40 frame includes the position of the reported decrement .",
    "they find that the lyman - break galaxies are homogeneously distributed across the frame , and do not clump near the reported position of the decrement .",
    "this result is reproduced by haynes ( 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , they find an anticorrelation between the position of lyman - break galaxies and the p1643 + 4631 decrement , although the small number of galaxies makes the significance questionable . given the magnitude limits of the observations , the authors claim it would be unlikely that galaxies at redshift @xmath41 could be detected .",
    "they go on to propose that the dearth of galaxies in the direction of the pc1643 + 4631 decrement is consistent with the lensing signature of a massive cluster at @xmath42 .",
    "however , the x - ray results place any cluster capable of producing the claimed decrement at a redshift of @xmath43 , at which point it would be incapable of producing the supposed lensing . therefore",
    ", we conclude that there is no optical evidence for a massive galaxy cluster in the direction of pc1643 + 4631a , b .",
    "we observed pc1643 + 4631 with our cm - wave receivers mounted on 9 of the @xmath44 m telescopes of the ( berkeley illinois maryland association ) bima array .",
    "this system has been used to obtain high signal to noise images of the sze toward more than @xmath45 clusters , and for more than 20 clusters if we include observations with the same receivers mounted on the ovro millimeter - array ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the primary beam at our observing frequency of @xmath2ghz is @xmath46 fwhm . to achieve high brightness sensitivity ,",
    "seven telescopes were arranged in a compact non - redundant configuration contained within a triangular region roughly 18 m on a side . to improve discrimination against point sources ,",
    "the remaining two telescopes were placed at stations @xmath47 m east and @xmath48 m north from the center of the compact array .",
    "the primary beam and the range of projected baselines ( @xmath49 to @xmath50 ) are well matched to the @xmath0ghz ryle telescope observations ( @xcite ) .",

    ", we performed three deep observations each centered on one of the three point sources reported in jones ( 1997 ) .",
    "the coverage was not uniform , but for each of the three observations the array produced a naturally weighted beam @xmath78 and a map _ rms _ of @xmath79 .",
    "simultaneously fitting to all the ovro and bima @xmath70-@xmath71 , we detect three significant point sources in the field .",
    "the fluxes of the sources are all @xmath80jy and their positions agree well with those of the three sources found in the ryle observations . in holzapfel ( 1999 )",
    "we give a detailed description of the procedure for measuring the point sources and list the positions and fluxes of the three significant sources .",
    "the point source model is important for the anisotropy analysis presented in that work , but as we will show here , has little effect on the cluster emission constraints .",
    "the combination of the ovro and bima data do not reproduce the claimed decrement . to quantify this result",
    ", we fit the @xmath70-@xmath71 data to the cluster emission model proposed by jones ( 1997 ) to describe the ryle data . fixing the position and shape parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath81 ) of the spherical king model",
    ", we fit for the central decrement . after subtracting the three detected point sources",
    ", we find a best fit central decrement @xmath82k .",
    "this result is clearly inconsistent with the minimal model used to fit to the ryle data of @xmath83k .    because of the different spatial scales of the cluster and point sources , the combination of the ovro and bima data are able to simultaneously determine the positions and fluxes of the point sources while constraining the cluster emission model .",
    "we have repeated the fit for the central decrement while allowing the positions and fluxes of the three sources to simultaneously vary .",
    "the point source fluxes and positions are virtually unchanged from the previously determined values and the central decrement is found to be @xmath84k .",
    "in fact , removing the known point sources has no significant effect on the results ; repeating the model fit without subtracting any point sources , we find @xmath85k .",
    "therefore , the results we present are essentially independent of the point source model that we use . over the broad range of point source models we have considered ,",

    "is it possible that weak cluster emission well matched to the ryle beam could escape detection with bima ? to answer this question quantitatively ,",
    "we have used the bima data to constrain highly elliptical cluster models which would be well matched to the ryle beam . fixing the axial ratio to 2.0 and the major axis core radius to @xmath96 , we find @xmath97k . if we assume that @xmath83k , the bima data are inconsistent with this model for emission at greater than @xmath98 .",
    "we conclude that elongated emission can not account for the discrepancy between the ryle and bima results .",

    "<S> we report observations in the direction of these claimed sources with the berkeley illinois maryland association ( bima ) interferometer operating at @xmath2ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for sze emission in the direction of either of the claimed sources . in the case of pc1643 </S>",
    "<S> + 4631 , the bima data are inconsistent with the cluster emission model proposed by jones ( 1997 ) at greater than @xmath3 confidence . </S>",
    "<S> together with published x - ray and optical searches , these results make a compelling case against the existence of a massive cluster in the direction of pc1643 + 4631 . because of the different scales to which the vla and bima instruments are sensitive , the bima observations are not as constraining for the vla1312 + 4237 source . </S>",
    "<S> the bima data are inconsistent with the cluster model proposed by richards ( 1997 ) at @xmath4 confidence .    </S>"
