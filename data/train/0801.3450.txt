    "the recent measurements of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) made it clear that the current state of the universe is very close to a critical density and that the primordial density perturbations that seeded large - scale structure in the universe are nearly scale - invariant and gaussian , which is consistent with the inflationary paradigm .",
    "inflation is often implemented in models with a single or multiple scalar fields  @xcite , which undergo a slow - roll period allowing an early accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "furthermore , the universe seems to exhibit an interesting symmetry with regard to the accelerated expansion , namely , it underwent inflation at early epochs and is believed to be accelerating at present .",
    "the current acceleration of the universe is supported by observations of high redshift type ia supernovae  @xcite and , more indirectly , by observations of the cmb and galaxy clustering  @xcite . within the framework of general relativity",
    ", cosmic acceleration should be sourced by an energy - momentum tensor which has a large negative pressure ( dark energy )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to comply with the logical consistency and observations , the standard model should be valid somewhere between inflation at early epochs and quintessence at late times .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether one can build a model to join these two ends without disturbing the thermal history of the universe .",
    "attempts have been made to unify both these concepts using models with a single scalar field  @xcite , i.e. , in which a single scalar field plays the role of the inflaton and quintessence - the so - called quintessential inflation .    on the other hand , in recent years",
    "there has been increasing interest in the cosmological implications of a certain class of braneworld scenarios where the friedmann equation is modified at very high energies . in particular , in the randall - sundrum type ii ( rsii ) model  @xcite the square of the hubble parameter , @xmath8 , acquires a term quadratic in the energy density , allowing slow - roll inflation to occur for potentials that would be too steep to support inflation in the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology  @xcite . indeed , in a cosmological scenario in which the metric projected onto the brane is a spatially flat frw model , the friedmann equation in four dimensions reads ( after setting the 4d cosmological constant to zero and assuming that inflation rapidly makes any dark radiation term negligible )  @xcite @xmath9~. \\label{eq : friedmann}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the 4d reduced planck mass and @xmath11 in a universe dominated by a single minimally coupled homogeneous scalar field .",
    "the brane tension @xmath12 relates the 4d and 5d planck masses through the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the 5d planck mass .",
    "we notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : friedmann ] ) reduces to the usual friedmann equation at sufficiently low energies , , while at very high energies @xmath15 . in this scenario , all matter fields",
    "are confined to the brane and , hence , inflation is driven by a 4d scalar field trapped on the brane with the usual equation of motion @xmath16 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the scalar field @xmath1 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : friedmann ] ) and ( [ eq : kg ] ) it becomes clear that the presence of the additional term @xmath17 increases the damping experienced by the scalar field as it rolls down its potential .",
    "it has been shown that , in the rsii braneworld context , quintessential inflation can occur for a sum of exponentials or cosh potentials  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the modified exponential potential ( hereafter we adopt natural units , @xmath18 , unless stated otherwise ) @xmath19 \\label{eq : albrecht}\\ ] ] also leads to a successful quintessential inflation model .    in the context of quintessence",
    ", this potential was first analyzed by albrecht and skordis ( as )  @xcite .",
    "afterward , it has been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite . regarding its motivation , it is worth noticing that exponential potentials naturally appear in 4d field theories coming from string / m - theory  @xcite , where the scalar field @xmath1 is typically identified with the dilaton field .",
    "as far as the origin of the polynomial factor is concerned , it can be associated with a nontrivial khler term in an effective 4d supergravity theory  @xcite .",
    "the scalar @xmath1 could also be associated with a modulus ( radion ) field in curled extra dimensions  @xcite , which need not be universally coupled to matter / gauge fields and , therefore , is not subject to quantum corrections  @xcite .",
    "the tracking properties of the as potential are similar to the pure exponential , namely , it allows sufficient radiation domination during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , followed by matter domination .",
    "nevertheless , due to the presence of the polynomial factor , the field evolves to quintessence dominance near the present epoch .",
    "one should notice that , in order to the transition to happen near the present , the parameter @xmath20 must be suitably chosen .",
    "in other words , this model does not explain the so - called coincidence problem .",
    "however , the model displays an interesting feature : it can lead to both permanent and transient acceleration regimes .",
    "permanent acceleration occurs for @xmath21 , when the field is trapped in the local minimum of the potential .",
    "transient vacuum domination arises in two ways  @xcite : when @xmath21 and the @xmath1 field arrives at the minimum of the potential with enough kinetic energy to roll over the barrier and resumes descending the potential where @xmath22 , or for @xmath23 , when the potential loses its local minimum .    in the models mentioned above , inflation takes place when the pure exponential potential dominates the potential .",
    "the exit from inflation takes place naturally when the slow - roll conditions are violated because the high - energy brane corrections become unimportant .",
    "moreover , these models belong to the category of nonoscillating models in which the standard reheating mechanism does not work . in this case",
    ", one can employ an alternative mechanism of reheating via gravitational particle production  @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism is faced with difficulties associated with excessive production of gravity waves .",
    "indeed , the reheating mechanism based upon this process is extremely inefficient .",
    "the energy density of the produced radiation is typically one part in @xmath24  @xcite to the scalar field energy density at the end of inflation . as a result , these models have a prolonged kinetic regime during which the amplitude of primordial gravity waves is enhanced and the nucleosynthesis constraints are violated  @xcite .",
    "these problems can be circumvented if one invokes an alternative method of reheating , namely , the so - called instant preheating  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is quite efficient and robust , and is well suited to nonoscillating models  @xcite .",
    "the larger reheating temperature in this model results in a smaller amplitude of relic gravity waves which is consistent with the bbn bounds  @xcite .",
    "the exponential potential @xmath25 with @xmath26 has traditionally played an important role within the inflationary framework since , in the absence of matter , it gives rise to power - law inflation @xmath27 , provided @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath29 the potential becomes too steep to sustain inflation and for larger values @xmath30 the field enters a kinetic regime during which the field energy density @xmath31 .",
    "thus , within the standard general relativity framework , steep potentials are not capable of sustaining inflation . however , in the rsii scenario , the increased damping of the scalar field when @xmath32 leads to a decrease in the value of the slow - roll parameters and inflation becomes possible even for large values of @xmath6 .",
    "the cosmological dynamics with a steep exponential potential in the presence of a background ( radiation / matter ) admits a scaling solution as the attractor of the system .",
    "the attractor is characterized by the tracking behavior of the field energy density @xmath33 . during the tracking regime ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath33 to the background energy density @xmath34 is held fixed , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the equation - of - state parameter for the background ( @xmath37 for matter and radiation , respectively ) .",
    "the field energy density in the post inflationary regime would keep tracking the background being subdominant such that it does not interfere with the thermal history of the universe .",
    "nevertheless , the polynomial factor in the as potential will allow the scalar field to dominate near the present time , for a suitable choice of the parameters . if one takes into account the nucleosynthesis constraint @xmath38  @xcite , coming from the primordial abundances of @xmath39he and d , eq .",
    "( [ track ] ) would require @xmath40 .",
    "we notice however that this bound can be slightly relaxed if the scalar field has not yet entered the tracking regime during bbn ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : quintessence ] ) .",
    "let us first review the slow - roll inflation driven by an exponential potential in the high - energy regime of the rsii braneworld .",
    "these results will be important to determine the initial conditions for the solution of the evolution equations at later times .",
    "the number of @xmath41-folds during the inflationary period is given by  @xcite @xmath42 d{\\phi}~,\\label{eq : nfolds}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 corresponds to the field value at the end of inflation .",
    "braneworld effects at high energies increase the hubble rate by a factor @xmath44 , yielding more inflation between any two values of @xmath1 for a given potential . as @xmath45 during inflation , one gets @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the potential evaluated at @xmath48 @xmath41-folds from the end of inflation .",
    "the prediction for the inflationary variables typically depends on the number of @xmath41-folds of inflation occurring after the observable universe leaves the horizon , @xmath49 .",
    "the calculation of this quantity requires a model of the entire history of the universe  @xcite and , as we shall see later , it can be determined once we set the reheating mechanism after inflation .",
    "inflation ends when the slow - roll conditions are violated , because the brane high - energy corrections become unimportant .",
