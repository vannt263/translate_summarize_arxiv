    "<S> within the phenomenological ginzburg - landau theory we investigate the phase diagram of a thin superconducting film with ferromagnetic nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> we study the oscillatory dependence of the critical temperature on an external magnetic field similar to the little - parks effect and formation of multiquantum vortex structures . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of a superconducting state is studied both analytically and numerically .    little - parks effect @xcite , i.e. oscillations of the critical temperature @xmath0 of multiply  connected superconducting samples in an applied magnetic field @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> is one of the striking phenomenon demonstrating coherent nature of superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> such oscillatory behaviour of @xmath2 is not a distinctive feature of a superconducting thin  </S>",
    "<S> wall cylinder and can be observed also in superconductors with columnar defects and holes ( see references @xcite ) and mesoscopic simply  </S>",
    "<S> connected samples of the size of several coherence lengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the oscillations of @xmath0 with a change in the external magnetic flux are caused by the transitions between the states with different vorticities ( winding numbers ) characterizing the circulation of the phase of the order parameter . for a system with cylindrical symmetry </S>",
    "<S> the vorticity parameter just coincides with the angular momentum of the cooper pair wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the states with a certain angular momentum @xmath3 can be considered as @xmath3-quanta vortices . </S>",
    "<S> experimental and theoretical investigations of these exotic vortex structures ( multiquanta vortices and vortex molecules ) in mesoscopic superconductors have attracted a great deal of attention . </S>",
    "<S> as we change an external homogeneous magnetic field multiquanta vortices and vortex molecules can transform one into another via first or second order phase transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we focus on another possibility to create multiquantum vortex states : nucleation of superconducting order parameter in a hybrid system consisting of a thin superconducting film and an array of magnetic nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the interest to such structures is stimulated by their large potential for applications ( e.g. , as switches or systems with a controlled artificial pinning ) . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the depinning critical current density @xmath4 has been observed experimentally for superconducting films with arrays of submicron magnetic dots @xcite , antidots @xcite , and for superconductor  ferromagnet ( s / f ) bilayers with domain structure in ferromagnetic films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the matching effects observed for magnetic and transport characteristics were explained in terms of commensurability between the flux lattice and the lattice of magnetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> vortex structures and pinning in the s / f systems at rather low magnetic fields ( in the london approximation ) have been analysed in papers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> provided the thickness of a superconducting film is rather small as compared with the coherence length , the critical temperature of the superconducting transition as well as the structure of superconducting nuclei should be determined by a two  dimensional distribution of a magnetic field component @xmath5 ( perpendicular to the superconducting film plane ) induced by the ferromagnetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the highest critical temperature corresponds to the nuclei which appear near the lines of zeros of @xmath6 due to the mechanism analogous to the one responsible for the surface superconductivity ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite ) and domain wall superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> provided these lines of zeros have the shape of closed loops , the winding number of a superconducting nucleus will be determined by the magnetic flux through the loop . </S>",
    "<S> thus , changing this flux ( e.g. , increasing an external @xmath1 field applied along the @xmath7 axis ) we can control the winding number . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase transitions between the multiquantum states with different @xmath3 can cause the oscillations of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such oscillatory behaviour has been , in fact , observed in reference @xcite for a nb film with an array of gdco particles . </S>",
    "<S> note that a change in a slope of the phase transition curve @xmath2 ( which is probably a signature of the transition discussed above ) has been also found in reference @xcite for a pb film with copd particles . provided the dimensions of the sample in the @xmath8 plane are compared with the coherence length , we can expect a rather complicated picture which is influenced both by the sample edges and by the distribution of an inhomogeneous magnetic field . for a model step - like profile of the magnetic field the resulting phase transitions between different types of exotic vortex states in a mesoscopic disc have been studied numerically in reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between the boundary effects and magnetic field inhomogeneity influences also the formation of multiquantum vortex states around a finite size magnetic dot embedded in a large area superconducting film @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions between different multiquantum vortex states with a change in magnetic field and magnetic dot parameters were studied in references @xcite for certain temperature values . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are closely related to the ones observed in mesoscopic and multiply - connected samples , and consequently , we can expect that the oscillations of @xmath2 ( analysed below ) should also be a common feature of multiply - connected superconductors and thin - film systems with magnetic dots .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we do not consider the magnetic phase transitions in the mixed state for @xmath9 and focus on the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath2 in a large area superconducting film caused only by the quantization associated with the characteristics of the inhomogeneous magnetic field produced by ferromagnetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect the influence of the edge and proximity effects in the s / f system and consider a nanoparticle only as a source of a small - scale magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> our further consideration is based on the linearized ginzburg - landau model : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the order parameter , @xmath12 is the vector potential , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath15 is the coherence length , and @xmath16 is the critical temperature of the bulk superconductor at @xmath17 . for the sake of simplicity we neglect the interference effects between the superconducting nuclei appearing near different nanoparticles ( i.e. assume the interparticle distance to be rather large as compared with the superconducting nucleus size ) and consider a single magnetic particle with a fixed magnetic moment chosen perpendicular to the film plane @xmath18 . for a rather thin film ( of the thickness less than the coherence length ) we can neglect the influence of the field components @xmath19 in the film plane and consider an axially symmetrical two  dimensional problem ( [ gl - eq ] ) in the field @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath7component of the field induced by the ferromagnetic particle and @xmath22 is a cylindrical coordinate system . choosing the gauge @xmath23 one can find the solution of the equation ( [ gl - eq ] ) in the form @xmath24 , where @xmath3 is the vorticity , and @xmath25 for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath27 should be determined from the equation : @xmath28g_m   = \\frac{1}{\\xi^2(t)}g_m \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath29 is the total flux through the circle of radius @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest eigenvalue @xmath31 of the schrdinger - like equation ( [ schr ] ) defines the critical temperature @xmath0 of the phase transition into a superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> obviously , for rather small fields @xmath1 the superconducting order parameter can nucleate either far from the magnetic particle ( @xmath32 ) where the critical temperature @xmath33 is defined by the homogeneous field @xmath34 or in the region close to the circle of the radius @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath0 is controlled by the slope of @xmath37 at @xmath38 and by the flux through the area of the radius @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> in the first case we obtain @xmath39 . for the second case we can analyse the behaviour of @xmath2 assuming that the characteristic length scale @xmath40 of the order parameter nucleus is much less than the characteristic scale of the magnetic field distribution . within such local approximation ( similar to the one used in reference @xcite for the description of domain wall superconductivity ) we can expand the flux in powers of the distance from @xmath35 : @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> this local approximation is valid under the following conditions : @xmath42    introducing a new coordinate @xmath43 we obtain the dimensionless equation @xmath44 where the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by the expressions : @xmath47{\\frac{\\phi_0}{\\pi \\left|b_{\\rm z}^\\prime(r_0)\\right| } } \\ ,   \\quad   q = -\\left(\\frac{\\phi(r_0)}{\\phi_0}+m\\right )   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\phi_0}{\\pi r_0 ^ 3 b_{\\rm z}^\\prime(r_0 ) } } \\ .\\ ] ]    we obtain @xmath48 when @xmath49 , and @xmath50 when @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal value of @xmath52 is @xmath53 at @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the final expression for the critical temperature reads :    @xmath55{\\frac{\\phi_0}{\\pi r_0 ^ 3 b_{\\rm z}^\\prime(r_0)}}\\right )   + o\\left(\\frac{\\ell^2}{r_0 ^ 2}\\right )   \\right ] \\ .\\ ] ]    the superconducting nuclei are localized near the ferromagnetic particle at a distance @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the states with different energetically favorable winding numbers @xmath3 correspond to the multiquantum vortex structures very similar to the ones observed in a mesoscopic disc . </S>",
    "<S> as we change an external field @xmath1 , we change the flux @xmath56 and , thus , change the energetically favorable vorticity number and position of the nucleus .    to investigate the details of the oscillatory behaviour discussed above we consider a particular case of a small ferromagnetic particle which can be described as a point magnetic dipole with a magnetic moment @xmath57 placed at a height @xmath58 over the superconducting film . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding expressions for the field and the vector potential are : @xmath59    introducing @xmath60 and a dimensionless coordinate @xmath61 we obtain the equation ( [ schr ] ) in the form : @xmath62   + \\frac{m}{\\rho}\\right)^2 f_m =   \\frac{h^2}{\\xi_0 ^ 2}\\left(1-\\frac{t_{\\rm c}}{t_{\\rm c0}}\\right)f_{m } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the dimensionless flux through the area with the positive field @xmath21 and @xmath64 . in the limit of small fields @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> the nucleation of superconductivity occurs at large distances @xmath66 and critical temperatures for different winding numbers @xmath3 are very close . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this limit the critical temperature is equal to @xmath33 and is not sensitive to the presence of the dipole . </S>",
    "<S> below this temperature we obtain a lattice of singly quantized vortices ( with the concentration determined by @xmath1 ) which is surely disturbed under the dipole . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the behaviour of @xmath67 in this low field regime should modify provided we take account of a finite distance between the magnetic particles . for large absolute values </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 ( much larger than the maximum field induced by the dipole ) we obtain the following asymptotical behaviour of @xmath0 : @xmath69 for negative @xmath1 and @xmath70 for positive @xmath1 values ( here @xmath71 is the minimum of the dipole field ) . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity nucleates near the minima of the total field @xmath72 and , thus , is localized near the dipole . in the intermediate field region ( @xmath73 ) </S>",
    "<S> we should expect the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath0 discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> the number of oscillations is controlled by the parameter @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out the numerical calculations of equation ( [ numer ] ) for the various @xmath74 values . </S>",
    "<S> for the numerical analysis of the localized states of equation ( [ numer ] ) we approximated it on a equidistant grid and obtained the eigenfunctions @xmath75 and eigenvalues by the diagonalization method of the tridiagonal difference scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these calculations as well as the analytical dependence of @xmath0 given by the expression ( [ ana ] ) are shown in figure [ fig1ab ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we observed a remarkable asymmetry of the phase transition curve ( @xmath76 ) which is caused by the difference in the distributions of positive and negative parts of the dipole field @xmath21 : the maximum positive field ( @xmath77 ) is much larger than the absolute value of the minimum negative field ( @xmath78 ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 oscillations appear to be most pronounced for negative @xmath1 which compensate the positive part of the dipole field . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath79 ( for a ferromagnetic particle with dimensions @xmath80 and magnetization @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 we obtain @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the characteristic scales of @xmath0 oscillations @xmath85 , @xmath86 for a nb film with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath0 can be observable , e.g. , in magnetoresistance measurements of thin superconducting films with arrays of ferromagnetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting nuclei localized near the particles should result in the partial decrease in the resistance below the oscillating @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as we decrease the temperature below @xmath2 the supeconducting order parameter around a single particle becomes a mixture of angular harmonics with different @xmath3 values and we can expect the appearance the phase transitions similar to the ones discussed in papers @xcite . with the further decrease in temperature the whole film becomes superconducting and resistivity turns to zero .    </S>",
