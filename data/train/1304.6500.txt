    "the latter guarantees monotonic convergence independent of the specific choice of optimization functional , type of interaction between system and external control , and equations of motion . in the quantum control literature ,",

    "a first modification of a monotonically convergent algorithm to account for a non - linear interaction with the control assumes the cost to be quadratic in the field and decomposes the control into @xmath0 components for a nonlinearity of order @xmath0  @xcite .",
