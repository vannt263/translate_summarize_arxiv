    "using the language of non - relativistic quantum field theory , the csl model is formulated in terms of a stochastic differential equation in the fock space associated with the system @xcite .",

    "the model is characterized by two parameters : @xmath14 , which sets the strength of the collapse process , and @xmath15 , which determines the threshold above which spatial superpositions are suppressed .",
    "the choice of the numerical values for these parameters is of course ultimately dictated by the agreement with the experimental data ; the originally proposed values are @xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "-3cm*(a ) * +     the mass density operators @xmath18 in eq.([eq : sdecsl ] ) induce a collapse of the wavefunction @xmath19 around the common eigenvectors of the position operators of the particles composing the system @xcite .",
    "hence , the asymptotic wavefunction is sharply localized around defined positions , excluding possible spatial superpositions .",
    "the collapse rate for a microscopic system is given by @xmath20 .",
    "such a small value guarantees that the spatial localization due to the noise field can be safely neglected if a microscopic system is taken into account .",
    "now instead , consider a macroscopic rigid body in a superposition of two states distant more than @xmath15 .",
    "its center of mass collapses with an effective rate @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of constituents of the body contained in a volume @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes how many such volumes are held in the macroscopic body .",
    "this relation clearly shows the amplification mechanism , which is at the basis of every collapse model .",
    "the localization induced by the noise field grows with the size of the system , so that the center of mass of any macroscopic object behaves , for all practical purposes , according to classical mechanics .",
    "the peculiar property of the csl model is the quadratic dependence of the rate @xmath25 on the number of constituents , which is a direct consequence of the action of the noise field on identical particles @xcite .",
    "the main features of the csl model are summarized in fig.[fig:1 ] , where we represent the time evolution of the position probability distribution of one particle , which is initially in a superposition of two gaussian states .",
    "the wavefunction is subjected continuously to the action of the noise , which suppresses the superposition between the two gaussians , leading to a gaussian state localized around one of the two initial peaks , in a time scale fixed by the collapse rate , see fig.[fig:1 ] * ( a ) * and * ( b)*. the diffusive nature of the dynamics in the csl model is clearly illustrated by the time - evolution of the position variance , see fig.[fig:1 ] * ( c)*.    a relevant drawback of the original csl model , as well as of most collapse models , is that the average kinetic energy of the quantum system diverges on the long time scale .",
    "the model predicts that the energy of a particle with mass @xmath26 increases linearly in time with a rate @xmath27 as will become clear by the following analysis , the reason for such an energy increase is precisely due to the absence of dissipation within the model .",
    "the noise acts like an infinite temperature background , steadily increasing the energy of the system .",
    "now that we have clarified the problem of the csl model we want to work out , as well as the features that must be preserved , we are in the position to formulate a new , dissipative csl model . as for the original model , the most compact way to do so , is to define a proper stochastic differential equation .",
    "specifically , we consider the following non - linear stochastic differential equation : @xmath28 { \\mathrm{d}}w_t({\\bf y } ) \\right . \\\\ & & \\left.- \\frac{\\gamma}{2 m^2_0 } \\int { \\mathrm{d}}{\\bf y }   [ [ \\hat{\\mathbb{l}}^{\\dag}({\\bf y})\\hat{\\mathbb{l}}({\\bf y})+r^2_t({\\bf y})-2r_t({\\bf y})\\hat{\\mathbb{l}}({\\bf y } ) ] { \\mathrm{d}}t \\right ] { \\vert \\varphi_t \\rangle } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 the inclusion of dissipation calls for the introduction of a new parameter , @xmath32 , with the dimension of a velocity . crucially , this parameter is related to the temperature of the noise field , as it will be shown later ( see eq.([eq : t ] ) ) , where the numerical choice of @xmath32 will be also discussed .",
    "the structure of the stochastic differential equation ( [ eq : sdecsld ] ) generalizes that of eq.([eq : sdecsl ] ) to the case of non self - adjoint operators @xcite . indeed , for @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 , one recovers the original csl model .",
    "the physical meaning of the operator @xmath35 in eq.([eq : ly ] ) is better understood by taking into account also its momentum representation .",
    "one has @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the creation and annihilation operator of a particle of the type @xmath2 with momentum @xmath39 . by eqs.([eq : ly ] ) and ( [ eq : lymom ] ) , we see that the action of the collapse noise can be compared to that of an external potential which depends not only on the position , but also on momentum of the system , thus inducing dissipation . in particular , since the exchanged momentum @xmath40 in the spatial direction @xmath41 has a gaussian distribution peaked around @xmath42 , the action of the noise will suppress high momenta , so that the mean kinetic energy of the system , as well as the mean momentum , is subject to relaxation .",
    "this is explicitly shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : era ] .",
    "indeed , contrary to any external field , the collapse noise induces an anti - hermitian coupling with matter , which is necessary in order to induce localization .",
    "in addition , the introduction of dissipation also leads to an hermitian contribution to the coupling , see sec . [",
    "sec : haa ] .      in order to study the solutions and properties of eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) , it is often convenient to deal with an equivalent linear stochastic differential equation @xcite . here , we briefly sketch the standard procedure which provides the linear stochastic differential equation associated with the non - linear one in the form given by eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) . for a complete treatment ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "consider a non - linear stochastic differential equation as eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) . recall that @xmath43 denotes an ensemble of independent wiener processes defined on a common probability space @xmath44",
    "let @xmath45 be the ensemble of processes given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 has been defined after eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) .",
    "now , by means of the girsanov theorem one can define a new probability @xmath48 on @xmath49 such that @xmath50 is an ensemble of wiener processes under @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can define a random vector @xmath51 such that @xmath52 where @xmath19 satisfies eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) , while @xmath53 satisfies @xcite @xmath54 { \\vert { \\psi}_t \\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the linear stochastic differential equation associated with the dissipative csl model .      in this paragraph , we show that eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) can be written in a way such that the coupling between the classical collapse noise and quantum matter is made explicit .",
    "in particular , the introduction of dissipation within the csl model leads to an hermitian contribution to the coupling of the collapse noise with quantum matter , in addition to a contribution in the usual ( for collapse models ) anti - hermitian form @xcite .",
    "it is here convenient to use the stratonovich formalism @xcite and to consider the decomposition of @xmath35 into its hermitian and anti - hermitian part , @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 self - adjoint operators .",
    "thus , the non - linear stochastic equation given by eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) leads to @xmath58 { \\vert \\varphi_t \\rangle},\\label{eq : eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the white - noise field , which can be formally written as @xmath60 and satisfies the relations @xmath61 = 0 \\qquad \\mathbb{e}[w({\\bf x},t ) w({\\bf y},t ' ) ] = \\delta({\\bf x } - { \\bf y})\\delta(t - t'),\\ ] ] @xmath62 being the stochastic average under the reference probability @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , @xmath64 is an hermitian contribution coming from the passage to the stratonovich formalism and reads @xmath65 on the other hand , @xmath66 includes the non - linear contributions preserving the norm of the state vector and is given by @xmath67   -   \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}{m_0 } \\int { \\mathrm{d}}{\\bf y } \\langle\\hat{\\mathbb{l}}^{(a)}({\\bf y})\\rangle_t w({\\bf y},t ) ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] compare with eq.(7.43 ) in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eq ] ) describes the coupling between the classical field @xmath59 and quantum matter .",
    "now , since @xmath35 is not a self - adjoint operator such a coupling has an hermitian , as well as an anti - hermitian contribution .",
    "note that in the original csl model the collapse noise is coupled with matter only via an anti - hermitian term @xcite . to be explicit , eq.([eq : lymom ] ) implies @xmath68 and thus @xmath69 and @xmath70 of course , @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the energy behavior of a system subjected to the collapse noise in our extended model .",
    "we deal with the master equation implied by the stochastic differential equation given by eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) . after presenting the equation in a second - quantization formalism ,",
    "we describe the corresponding operators in the case of a fixed number of particles . in particular , by focusing on the one - particle case ,",
    "we show explicitly the exponential relaxation of the energy to a finite value .",
    "the non - linear , as well as the linear , stochastic differential equation fully fixes the collapse model we are defining here .",
    "however , one is often interested in the predictions of the model related with the statistical mean of some physical quantity , @xmath73,\\ ] ] where , as usual , @xmath19 is the stochastic state of the system satisfying eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) .",
    "for this reason , it can be convenient to deal directly with the evolution of the average state @xmath74,\\ ] ] so that one recovers the usual relation @xmath75 by using the it calculus , it is easy to see that eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) implies the following master equation : @xmath76 +    \\frac{\\gamma}{m^2_0 } \\int { \\mathrm{d}}{\\bf y }   \\left[\\hat{\\mathbb{l}}({\\bf y})\\hat{\\rho}(t)\\hat{\\mathbb{l}}^{\\dag}({\\bf y } ) \\right . \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\left .",
    "- \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{\\hat{\\mathbb{l}}^{\\dag}({\\bf y } ) \\hat{\\mathbb{l}}({\\bf y } ) , \\label{eq : mecsldiss }   \\hat{\\rho}(t)\\right\\ } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a lindblad master equation @xcite , indicating that we are in the presence of a time - homogeneous markovian dynamics .",
    "the lindblad operators are the same operators as those appearing in the stochastic differential equation defining the model , see eq.([eq : ly ] ) or eq.([eq : lymom ] ) .",
    "the expressions of the lindblad operators @xmath35 restricted to a sector of the fock space with a fixed number of particles is easily obtained as follows .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that we have @xmath77 particles of the same type and mass @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding restriction of @xmath35 reads @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are , respectively , the position and momentum operator of the @xmath81-th particle and @xmath82 is the constant given by eq.([eq : kj ] ) with @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , consider the hilbert space @xmath84 and the corresponding fock space @xmath85 , where @xmath86 denotes the symmetric or antisymmetric part of the tensor product @xmath87 , @xmath77 times .",
    "now consider the operator on @xmath88 given by @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a single - particle operator on @xmath84 , with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , position and momentum operators on @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the restriction of @xmath93 on the @xmath77-particle sector of the fock space reads @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 being the position and momentum operator of the @xmath81-th particle .",
    "the relation between eq.([eq : c ] ) and eq.([eq : un ] ) is indeed the same as that between eq.([eq : lymom ] ) and eq.([eq : lybb ] ) .",
    "if we further restrict to the case of a single free particle with mass @xmath26 , we end up with the following master equation for the one - particle average state @xmath97 @xmath98 +   \\frac{\\gamma m^2}{(2 \\pi \\hbar)^3 m^2_0 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left ( \\int   { \\mathrm{d}}{\\bf { q } } \\ , e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } { \\bf { q } } \\cdot \\hat{{\\bf x } } }   l({\\bf q } , \\hat{\\bf p } ) \\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}(t )   l({\\bf q } , \\hat{\\bf p})e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar } { \\bf { q } } \\cdot \\hat{{\\bf x}}}\\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left .",

    "the master equation for the system s statistical operator provides us with the evolution equation of the mean kinetic energy of the one - particle system , @xmath100 exploiting the translation covariance of eq.([eq : mecsldiss2 ] ) @xcite one gets @xmath101 this equation is solved by @xmath102 with relaxation rate @xmath103 and asymptotic kinetic energy @xmath104 as expected , now we do have dissipation . the mean energy of the system can decrease as a consequence of the action of the noise .",
    "moreover , even if the energy grows , there is an upper threshold value above which it can not increase .",
    "the long - time energy divergence is now avoided @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the result we wanted and the most natural way to interpret it is to say that the collapse noise has a finite temperature toward which the system thermalizes @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath105 corresponds to a noise temperature @xmath106 where we used eq.([eq : kj ] ) and @xmath107 is the boltzmann constant . the original csl model is recovered in the limit @xmath108 : the noise acts like an infinite temperature background , which explains the energy divergence .    the temperature of the noise in eq.([eq : t ] )",
    "does not depend on the mass of the system , which is a very important feature of our model .",
    "in addition , the state of the system actually equilibrates to the canonical gibbs state , see appendix [ sec : adc ] .",
    "these hallmarks of the evolution induced by eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) depend substantially on the choice of the operators @xmath109 in eq.([eq : ly ] ) .",
    "it is an open question to identify the entire class of operators satisfying these natural requests . in appendix",
    "[ sec : adc ] , we take into account a physically motivated alternative to the choice made in eq.([eq : ly ] ) , showing how the relaxation dynamics of the resulting collapse model is very similar to that presented here and , in particular , the noise temperature is still given by eq.([eq : t ] ) .",
    "the exponential relaxation of the energy @xmath110 in eq.([eq : ht ] ) is the same as that in the dissipative ghirardi - rimini - weber ( grw ) model recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , since , as for the case without dissipation , the extended grw and csl models share the same one - particle master equation .",
    "if we think that the collapse model fixed by eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) describes in a phenomenological way the action of a real physical field filling space , it is now clear how the principle of energy conservation can be reestablished .",
    "the energy gained or lost by the system can be ascribed to an energy exchange with the noise field , as the latter can be influenced back by the presence of the system .",
    "an explicit characterization of this process requires an underlying theory , which has to guarantee the classical nature of the noise field , with its own ( non - quantum ) equations of motion , in order to provide a proper objective collapse of the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can already say that a collapse noise with typical cosmological features would correspond to a low - temperature noise @xcite , at most of the order of few kelvins . by eq.([eq : t ] ) , we see that the noise temperature @xmath111 is in one - to - one correspondence with the new parameter @xmath32 . for instance , @xmath112 ( i.e. @xmath113 for a nucleon ) gives @xmath114 .",
    "hence , more than the specific value of the noise temperature , the important thing is that even in the presence of a low - temperature noise the resulting collapse model can be introduced in a consistent way ; see also the discussion in the next section .",
    "it is worth noting that it is not always possible to properly modify a given collapse model to include dissipation via the action of a low - temperature noise . in @xcite",
    "we discuss how such a modification is not feasible for the disi - penrose model  @xcite , in which gravity is involved to provide a phenomenological description of the wavefunction collapse .    in our model , every system with a temperature higher than about @xmath115",
    "is cooled by the action of the collapse noise .",
    "thus , we are led to reject the bounds on the collapse rate @xmath1 relying on a balance between the system s heating due to the action of the noise in the original csl model and the cooling due to , e.g. , the universe expansion or the energy radiation .",
    "this is the case for the heating of the protons constituting the intergalactic medium or for the energy accumulation in interstellar dust grains @xcite .",
    "note how , in particular , the heating of the igm provides the second strongest bound to date on the localization rate @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "even more , we expect that cosmological data will put strong bounds on the dissipation parameter @xmath82 ( equivalently , on @xmath32 ) .",
    "the modified long - time behavior of the energy predicted by our model will have to be compared with the constraints coming from such data .",
    "some preliminary results have been obtained for the non - dissipative csl model @xcite .",
    "dissipative effects are expected to play an important role also in the experimental investigation of collapse models via optomechanical systems @xcite , where proper signatures could be visible in the density noise spectrum of the mechanical oscillator , or via the spontaneous photon emission from electrically charged particles @xcite , as the latter is registered over a period of several years . in both situations , we expect that dedicated experiments should allow to restrict the possible values of @xmath82 ; of course , also in relation with the other parameters of the model .",
    "as recalled in sec . [ sec : tcm ] , any proper collapse model is characterized by the amplification mechanism . the localizing action of the collapse noise has to increase with size of the system , which guarantees a consistent description of microscopic and macroscopic systems within a unique theoretical framework . here",
    ", we show that the amplification mechanism holds in our extended model , at least as long as one deals with a macroscopic rigid body .",
    "the description of more complex systems , where the internal dynamics becomes involved , calls for a more detailed specification of the system s evolution @xcite .",
    "we stress that the following considerations are valid also in the case of a low temperature noise .",
    "as anticipated , even for a noise temperature @xmath114 we have effective localization and amplification mechanisms , so that the noise actually induces a classical behavior of the center of mass of macroscopic objects .",
    "finally , the different role of the momentum - dependent localization operators of our model in , respectively , the energy relaxation and the wave - function localization is clarified by comparing the time scales of the two phenomena .",
    "consider a macroscopic object made up of @xmath77 particles of equal mass @xmath26 .",
    "one can neglect the contributions due to the electrons and consider the mass of the proton @xmath116 equal to the mass of the neutron @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , we deal with a rigid body , which allows us to decouple the evolution of the center of mass from that of the relative coordinates  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath119 be the position operator of the center of mass , while the relative coordinates @xmath120 , @xmath121 , are fixed by @xmath122 , for a suitable matrix with elements @xmath123 .",
    "we neglect the possible rotations of the system : this greatly simplifies the description , without affecting the physical meaning of the results @xcite . by virtue of the rigid - body approximation ,",
    "the relative coordinates are fixed and the center - of - mass momentum @xmath124 is simply proportional to each individual momentum @xmath125 , according to @xmath126 , for each @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , consider a total hamiltonian @xmath127 , given by the sum of two terms associated with , respectively , the center of mass and the relative degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the state of center of mass @xmath128 satisfies a stochastic differential equation with the same form as eq.([eq : sdecsld ] ) , where @xmath5 is replaced by @xmath129 and @xmath35 is replaced by [ compare with eq.([eq : lybb ] ) ] @xmath130 @xmath124 being the center - of - mass momentum operator and we introduced the function @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the fixed @xmath2-th relative coordinate of the rigid body .",
    "the factor @xmath133 conveys the influence of the internal structure on the evolution of the center of mass and it is due to the indistinguishability of particles : it is also present in the original csl model @xcite , but not in the grw models @xcite .",
    "this factor determines the specific features of the amplification mechanism within the csl model .",
    "hence , we are interested in the action of the operator @xmath134 on a generic state @xmath135 of the center of mass and , in particular , we focus on the changes ( if any ) in the localization process due to dissipation . using the notation@xmath136 and @xmath137",
    ", we have the ( non - normalized ) wave function @xmath138 now , we use the continuum limit , so that @xmath139 @xmath140 being the macroscopic density of particles , and we obtain @xmath141 since @xmath142 one gets @xmath143 we now assume that this macroscopic density @xmath144 does not vary significantly on the length - scale fixed by @xmath145 , so that the exponential in eq.([eq : expv ] ) varies as a function of @xmath146 much faster than the other terms within the integral @xcite .",
    "thus , we can make the substitution @xmath147 in eq.([eq : expv ] ) , getting @xmath148 this clearly shows how the effects on the localization process due to the presence of the momentum operator in @xmath134 can be safely neglected , thus guarantying the convergence toward well localized states .",
    "the localization of the wavefunction , as , e.g. , represented in fig.[fig:1 ] , is basically not modified by the introduction of dissipation in the model .",
    "one can draw the same conclusion by dealing with the master equation of the average state , and , in addition , one recovers eq.([eq : g ] ) as an effective characterization of the scaling of the localization strength with the size of the system .",

    "in particular , if we consider a rigid body with constant density @xmath152 , we get @xcite @xmath153 with @xmath154 the number of particles of the body when its center of mass is in the position @xmath155 that are outside the volume occupied by the body when its center of mass is in @xmath156 . indeed ,",

    "the localization rate , which is vey small for microscopic systems increases with the size of the system proportionally to the square of the number of particles , which is a direct signature of the action of the noise on indistinguishable particles .",
    "the comparison between the dissipation rate @xmath158 and the localization rate @xmath25 , see eq.([eq : g ] ) , shows how the two phenomena occur on different time scales : while the center of mass of a macroscopic system will be quickly localized by the action of the noise , dissipation can possibly play a role on the system s evolution only on the long time scale .",
    "we take into account the evolution of the center - of - mass energy of a macroscopic rigid body with @xmath77 nucleons , @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the total mass .",
    "if we repeat the calculations performed in sects.[sec : eef ] , the master equation  ( [ eq : mecsldisscm ] ) , at first order in @xmath82 , leads to an exponential relaxation of the energy with rate @xmath161 where we considered a spherical object with radius radius @xmath64 and constant density and we made the following approximation @xcite @xmath162 the dissipation rate @xmath158 in eq.([eq : chi ] ) is much smaller than the corresponding localization rate , which , according to eq.([eq : g ] ) , is given by @xmath163 the ratio between the two rates in the case @xmath164 is @xmath165 if we consider a reference density @xmath166 , one has @xmath167)^3 $ ] , since @xmath168 of matter contains approximately an avogadro s number of nucleons .",

    "similarly , if @xmath173 , implying @xmath174 , we get @xmath175 , so that dissipation can still be neglected , while in this case @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , one could wonder how this analysis changes if we choose a different one - particle localization rate @xmath1 .",

    "for @xmath173 , we end up with @xmath180 , so that dissipation can play a role on the secular evolution of the system . however , also in this case the effect of dissipation on the localization of the wavefunction is completely negligible .",
    "localization occurs on a much shorter time scale than dissipation , @xmath181 , and then the influence of the dissipative terms in eq.([eq : expv ] ) can be neglected to study localization , even if it can subsequently play a role in the long - time behavior of the system .",
    "the main purpose of collapse models is to provide a unified framework for the description of microscopic and macroscopic systems , thus avoiding an ad - hoc dividing line within the theory , as well as yielding a dynamical explanation for the collapse of the wavefunction .",
    "the results of this paper point out that this program can be followed taking into account basic physically - motivated demands .    we have included dissipation in the csl model , which is up to now the most refined collapse model",
    ". this allowed us to remove the divergence of the energy on the long time scale affecting the original csl model .",
    "this divergence traces back to an infinite temperature of the collapse noise , which is of course an unrealistic feature of the model .",
    "the inclusion of dissipation brings along a new parameter , which is strictly related with the finite temperature of the noise .",
    "significantly , even in the presence of a low - temperature noise the localization and the amplification mechanism are effective , so that the unified description of microscopic and macroscopic systems is still guaranteed .",
    "a realistic description of the wavefunction collapse can be further developed , for example by also including a non - white noise @xcite within the model .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that the specific features of the collapse noise can be fixed only through a first - principle underlying theory , which can clarify the physical origin of the noise @xcite .",
    "the development of such an underlying theory is one of the main goals of the research on collapse models and , more in general , on the theories going beyond quantum mechanics .",
    "the authors acknowledge financial support by the eu project nanoquestfit , infn , fra-2014 by the university of trieste and cost ( mp1006 ) .",
    "they also thank m. bahrami , l. disi , s. donadi , l. ferialdi , and b. vacchini for many useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss an alternative and physically motivated choice for the operators @xmath35 , which differs from that made in eq.([eq : ly ] ) ( or , equivalently , in eq.([eq : lymom ] ) ) .",
    "we will see how this different choice does not affect significantly the features of the relaxation dynamics we are interested in .",
    "we also argue that in both cases the system s state equilibrates to the stationary solution in the gibbs form .",
    "let us consider the following operators : @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes the modulus of @xmath184 .",
    "indeed , such operators still reduce to those of the original csl model @xcite in the limit @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath185 . the difference with respect to the operators in eq.([eq : lymom ] ) is that now the action of the noise no longer damps the momentum of the system in an isotropic way , but it tends to suppress the momentum of a particle in the state @xmath186 mainly in the direction @xmath187",
    ". a significant motivation for collapse operators as in eq.([eq : lymom2 ] ) would be their correspondence with the operators used to describe the collisional decoherence in the presence of dissipation .",
    "in particular , let us consider for simplicity the one - particle case .",
    "then , the stochastic differential equation ( [ eq : sdecsld ] ) , along with the operators in eq.([eq : lymom2 ] ) , provides us with a master equation for the average one - particle state @xmath97 given by eq.([eq : mecsldiss2 ] ) , where @xmath188 is now @xmath189 this master equation is the same as that describing the collisional dynamics of a test particle interacting with a low - density gas in the weak coupling regime @xcite , once we make a proper identification of the coefficients in the two models .",
    "in particular , the new parameter @xmath32 corresponds to the most probable velocity @xmath190 of the gas particles , which have mass @xmath191 and a maxwell - boltzmann momentum distribution , see @xcite for more details .    by eqs.([eq :",
    "mecsldiss2 ] ) and ( [ eq : lqp2 ] ) , we directly have that the mean kinetic energy of the system evolves according to @xmath192 which involves the forth order momentum of the momentum operator and hence does not yield a closed equation for the mean kinetic energy .",
    "however , at first order in @xmath82 this equation is exactly the same as eq.([eq : hht ] ) , so that one recovers an exponential relaxation to a finite asymptotic energy which corresponds to the noise temperature in eq.([eq : t ] ) .",
    "even more , this expression of the noise temperature is proved exactly by studying the relaxation to the equilibrium of the system s state . by direct substitution",
    ", one can easily see that the canonical gibbs distribution @xmath193 is a stationary solution of eq.([eq : mecsldiss2 ] ) , with @xmath188 as in eq.([eq : lqp2 ] ) , if @xmath194 is the inverse temperature corresponding to eq.([eq : t ] ) .",
    "relying on the theorems by spohn @xcite , we conclude that this stationary solution is unique and , for any initial condition , the state @xmath195 converges to it .",
    "hence , the temperature in eq.([eq : t ] ) is the temperature toward which the system thermalizes and is thus identified as the noise temperature .",
    "the theorems by spohn apply when the set of lindblad operators @xmath196 of a given lindblad generator are such that only the multiples of the identity commute with all the elements of @xmath197 and that if @xmath198 is contained in @xmath197 , then also @xmath199 is so .",
    "indeed , these two conditions are satisfied by set of lindblad operators in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mecsldiss2 ] ) and ( [ eq : lqp2 ] ) . to be precise ,",
    "the theorems by sphon hold in the finite dimensional case , so that , to put the above discussion on a firm mathematical ground , one should confine the whole system in a finite volume ( which would also allow to take @xmath200 as a proper quantum state ) and include a cut - off on the momenta .",
    "in addition , once the uniqueness of the stationary state is guaranteed , the convergence to it for any initial condition can be alternatively proved by exploiting the contractivity of the relative entropy under completely positive and trace preserving maps @xcite .",
    "the same results can be applied to our dissipative csl model , i.e. , if @xmath188 is given by eq.([eq : lqp ] ) . beside providing a further proof of the relation in eq.([eq : t ] ) , this shows that our model predicts a convergence of the average one - particle state of the system to the stationary solution in the canonical form .                                                                                                      by replacing @xmath201 with @xmath202 in the argument of the wave function @xmath203 ,",
    "one obtains a shift of the order of @xmath204 , for a macroscopic particle made up of @xmath205 nucleons and a noise temperature of the order of @xmath115 ."
