    "in the regular minimal model program , one naturally encounters non-@xmath0-gorenstein varieties ",
    "i.e. , varieties where no multiple of the canonical divisor @xmath1 is @xmath0-cartier  as targets of small contractions .",
    "since the entire minimal model program is built on intersections with @xmath1 , there is the need to introduce flips .",
    "however , this created major historical roadblocks . until recently , it was not known",
    "that flips existed .",
    "moreover , at the moment we only know that a specific sequence of flips terminates , and it is still conjectured that every sequence of flips terminates .",
    "one of the main motivations for defining a minimal model program without flips is that such program would potentially avoid the issue of termination .",
    "the first necessary tool to build such program is a good notion of positivity on non-@xmath0-factorial singularities , and this was done in @xcite .",
    "the second tool are a cone and a contraction theorem , and these are the main results of this paper .",
    "we also outline an algorithm for a minimal model program without flips , whose outcome is the same as the regular mmp , i.e. , models with @xmath0-factorial singularities and fibers of contractions that are log fano .",
    "the key idea is that , instead of performing flips , we continue performing contractions and take a @xmath0-factorialization as last step ",
    "i.e. , a small , projective birational morphism whose source has @xmath0-factorial singularities .",
    "the next step is to prove termination of such program .",
    "i will discuss by the end of the introduction some of the issues .",
    "moreover , the models we obtain are a priori different from the ones we obtain with the usual mmp , so it is also essential to understand what is the relation between these new models and the usual ones .",
    "finally , we point out that several of the tools of this paper ( e.g. , the existence of @xmath0-factorializations ) are a consequence of @xcite .",
    "thus this program is in no way alternative to the usual one , but it ought to be considered more as a parallel one .    to describe a program , we need to articulate the largest class of singularities where the program is expected to work , and",
    "show that we do not leave such class under contractions .",
    "our program works on _ log terminal singularities _ , in the sense of @xcite , over an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath2 .",
    "this is essentially the same class as klt ; indeed , @xmath3 has log terminal singularities if and only if there exists a divisor @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is a klt pair . in section , we prove some generalizations of well known results . in some cases , the techniques used are the usual ones , but for some results , e.g. proposition [ prop : contr still lt ] , we use the full power of positivity for reflexive sheaves .    in section , after introducing a notion of numerically trivial weil divisors , we define the _ weil nron - severi space @xmath6 _ ( definition [ df : nsw ] ) which is the vector space of weil divisors , modulo the numerically trivial weil divisors .",
    "one of the first things we prove is the finiteness of this space :    let @xmath3 be a projective normal variety , defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath2 , with log terminal singularities .",
    "the space @xmath6 is finite dimensional and naturally contains the regular nron - severi space as a subspace .    since we are working with weil divisors , it is more natural to work with pushforwards than with pullbacks . in section",
    "we prove a rather technical result , upon which most of our work relies .",
    "although fairly natural from the point of view of positivity , the complications lie in the fact that we are working with weil divisors .",

    "finally , we relate our notion of numerical triviality with the one of fulton , @xcite .    in section",
    "we define the weil nef cone @xmath13 ( definition [ df : nefcone ] ) and the cone of weil curves @xmath14 , definition [ df : necone ] .",
    "the former is naturally defined as the cone generated by the classes of nef weil divisors in @xmath6 , while the latter is defined by duality .",
    "thus , the elements of @xmath14 are `` virtual '' curves .",

    "@xmath26 has log terminal singularities and @xmath27 .",
    "the trade - off of working with weil divisors is that we only obtain rational maps , which are not always morphisms .",
    "this is not a big sacrifice , since also the regular mmp uses rational maps . however , since the cone @xmath14 naturally surjects onto the usual cone of curves @xmath28 , corollary [ cor : new > ne ] , we obtain more maps . this is another reason why such program is worth exploring . by having more maps",
    ", we have a deeper understanding of the structure of the varieties .",
    "for example , from the point of view of mori contractions , all fano cones are alike ( a cone has picard number @xmath29 , so the only possible fano contraction is the map to a point ) .",
    "the weil cone of curves has a richer structure , as example [ ex : cone2 ] shows .    in section ,",
    "we propose a minimal model program without flips .",
    "what is still missing is precisely termination .",
    "we have a good understanding of how the cones change under small maps ; the main obstacle is that we do not know in general what happens when the maps are not small . in some sense , the same tools that handle flipping contractions do not work so easily when the contraction is not a flipping one .",
    "in particular , we would need a result like theorem [ thm:1.2 ] above for general birational projective morphisms ( with connected fibers ) .",
    "future hope is that we can obtain termination by studying the interplay of the two spaces , @xmath30 and @xmath6 .",
    "we point out that , since the outputs that we obtain are a priori different from the ones obtained by the usual mmp , remark [ rk : models ] , there is no immediate relation between the termination of our program and the usual termination .",
