    "recently two orbitally excited narrow @xmath1 mesons were reported to be observed by the cdf collaboration with masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "the heavy - light mesons can be categorized according to the total angular momentum of the light degree of freedom @xmath16 . combining @xmath16 with the spin of the heavy quark yields a doublet of heavy - light meson states @xmath17 . for @xmath18-wave ground - states with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , two states of negative parity form the @xmath21 doublet @xmath22 . for @xmath0-wave excited states with @xmath19 or @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , four states of positive parity form the @xmath18 doublet @xmath25 and the @xmath26 doublet @xmath27 .",
    "the two observed excited @xmath1 states above are considered as members of the @xmath26 doublet in the @xmath28 system @xcite .",
    "the four @xmath0-wave excited @xmath28 states are often referred to as @xmath2 .",
    "if kinematically allowed , they are expected to decay into @xmath29 , @xmath30 or both .",
    "the @xmath18 doublet of @xmath28 system , ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , are supposed to be broad because they decay through an @xmath18-wave transition while the @xmath26 doublet , ( @xmath14 , @xmath12 ) , are narrow because they decay through a @xmath33-wave transition @xcite .",
    "this is the case of @xmath14 and @xmath12 because their masses lie above the thresholds of @xmath29 and @xmath30 and they can decay dominantly through these strong channels as is expected .",

    "in fact , they are speculated to lie below the thresholds of @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the channels @xmath34 will be kinematically blocked and the isospin violating strong decays and electromagnetic decays will be their dominant decay modes .",

    "the qcd sum rule method @xcite , in combination with hqet , has been widely used to explore the properties and decays of heavy - light mesons and has been proved to be a powerful theoretical apparatus for studying heavy hadrons . in the past twenty years , study of semileptonic decay of the ground - state @xmath36 and @xmath1 mesons by this method and quark models has been extensively explored @xcite . in our previous works",

    "it can be easily extended to the case of the semileptonic decays of excited @xmath36 and @xmath1 mesons . to date , no work about the semileptonic decays of @xmath2 has been done with the same method .",

    "we now turn to the numerical evaluation of these sum rules and their phenomenological implications .",
    "the input parameters are as follows .",
    "the mass of the initial and final heavy mesons are @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 @xcite , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 @xcite . for the qcd parameters entering the theoretical expressions ,",
    "we take the standard values : @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the mass of the strange quark is @xmath161 .",
    "in addition , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the cutoff parameter is chosen as @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "let s evaluate the sum rule for @xmath56 numerically first . as we can see in eq.([rule1 ] ) , two decay constants ( @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) and two bounding energies ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) appear on the left - hand side as input parameters . in order to obtain information of isgur - wise function @xmath56 with less systematic uncertainty",
    ", we can remove these parameters by dividing the three - point sum rules with the square roots of relevant two - point sum rules , as many authors did @xcite .",
    "this can not only reduce the number of input parameters but also improve stabilities of the three - point sum rules .",
    "the two - point qcd sum rules we need here are @xcite @xmath169 after the division has been done , we obtain an expression for the @xmath56 as a function of the borel parameter @xmath26 and the continuum thresholds @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "imposing usual criteria for the upper and lower bounds of the borel parameter , we found they have a common sum rule  window \" : @xmath173 , which overlaps with those of the two - point sum rules ( [ conrule1 ] ) and ( [ conrule2 ] ) .",
    "notice that the borel parameter in the sum rule for three - point correlator is twice the borel parameter in the sum rules for the two - point correlators . in the evaluation we have taken @xmath174 @xcite and @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "the regions of these continuum thresholds are fixed by analyzing the corresponding two - point sum rules .",
    "following discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite , the upper limit @xmath170 for @xmath137 in the region @xmath176\\omega_{0}\\leqslant\\omega_{c1}\\leqslant\\frac{1}{2}(\\omega_{0}+\\omega_{2})$ ] is reasonable .",
    "so we can fix @xmath177 in the region @xmath178 .",
    "the results are showed in fig . 1 , in which we fix @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "we would like to address that @xmath181 and @xmath32 are still missing in experiments .",
    "their masses were theoretically estimated through various methods which gave quite different values @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios given in table [ table4 ] are calculated on the assumption that @xmath181 and @xmath32 lie below the thresholds of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "if this assumption is not true , @xmath181 and @xmath32 can decay through these modes and they both own a width of hundreds of mev .",
    "then the branching ratios of the semileptonic decays in table [ table4 ] should be 3 orders of magnitude lower . the present precision of the experimental measurement of the branching ratio of the @xmath1 mesons has reached up to @xmath182 @xcite . as we can see from table [ table2 ] and table [ table4 ] ,",
    "our numerical results indicate that the decay widths of these semileptonic modes are tiny and therefore exclude the possibility of finding them in experiments .",
    "the decays @xmath73 may be expected to be measured in the future lhcb experiment .",
    "if the experimental results agree with our prediction , it can be supportive to the ordinary @xmath183 meson explanation for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in summary",
    ", we have performed a study of the semileptonic decays of @xmath2 mesons into low lying charmed - strange mesons within the framework of hqet .",
    "two states out of the four @xmath0-wave excited @xmath1 mesons , @xmath14 and @xmath12 , have been recently measured by cdf and d0 collaborations while the other two , @xmath181 and @xmath32 , are still missing .",
    "we employ qcd sum rules to estimate the leading - order universal form factors describing the transitions of these @xmath2 states into low lying @xmath5 mesons , including @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9",
    ". the predicted branching ratios of these processes are prohibitively tiny .",
    "it is worth noting that the isgur - wise function @xmath79 which parameterizes the hadronic matrix element of the weak current between the @xmath18 doublet of @xmath28 system and the same doublet of @xmath35 system approximately satisfies the normalization condition , @xmath184 , which is implied by the heavy quark flavor symmetry at the leading order of the heavy quark expansion .",
    "although the branching ratios we predicted are very small , some of them are expected to be possibly observed in the forthcoming lhcb experiment .",
    "a measurement of these processes can provide some information on the structure of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons .",
