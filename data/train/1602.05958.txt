    "quantum metrology  @xcite is one of the most active research areas in quantum information science .",
    "the possibility to exploit quantum resources to boost the estimation of unknown parameters encoded in quantum states or channels is appealing for a variety of practical tasks , from gravitational wave detection  @xcite to frequency standards  @xcite and clock synchronization  @xcite . in the specific framework of continuous - variable systems  @xcite , parameter estimation typically involves the statistical inference of the phase  @xcite or loss  @xcite accumulated by a bosonic mode propagating through a gaussian channel .",
    "for this task , gaussian and non - gaussian resources have been extensively studied .    while the minimization of the estimation error over all quantum strategies is crucial to show the ultimate precision achievable by quantum mechanics , it is also important to study practical applications to realistic scenarios , where the access to quantum resources may be limited and the presence of decoherence may even destroy the quantum advantage shown for the noiseless models . this is an important gap to fill for bosonic systems , where previous studies on loss estimation were devoted to finding the optimal error scaling reachable by squeezing , entanglement or other highly non - classical features in decoherence - free scenarios  @xcite with only preliminary analysis on the effects of thermal decoherence  @xcite",
    ".    here we extend the state - of - the - art on bosonic loss estimation in two ways .",
    "first of all , we consider the practical use of correlated - thermal sources which can be easily engineered by using a beam splitter . these sources are generally designed to be asymmetric so that only a few mean photons are irradiated through the unknown lossy channel , while the majority of them are deviated onto an ancillary channel .",
    "thanks to this asymmetric splitting , the lossy channel is ` non - invasively ' probed with low energy , while enough correlations are created with the ancillary photons to improve the final detection .",
    "this practical scheme is relevant in various realistic scenarios .",
    "for instance , this is the simplest strategy to improve the optical setups of photometers and spectrophotometers currently employed in experimental biology .",
    "these instruments use thermal lamps at optical or uv wavelengths to measure the concentration of bacteria , cells , or nucleic acids ( dna / rna ) in fragile biological samples via an estimation of the transmissivity  @xcite . our interferometric design would introduce correlations and",
    "greatly improve their performance .",
    "other important scenarios are the far infrared and microwave regimes where quantum features are hard to generate . by contrast , correlated - thermal sources can be easily generated in these cases , and could be adopted ( in the long run ) to advance applications such as protein terahertz spectroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging .",
    "similar implications could also be envisaged at very high - frequencies , where quasi - monochromatic x - ray beams can now be generated by small - scale all - laser - driven compton sources with good  spatial - temporal coherence  @xcite .",
    "these thermal beams could be manipulated by x - ray beam splitters based on laue - bragg diffraction  @xcite or other x - ray interferometry  @xcite .    besides the focus on cheap correlated - thermal sources , the second novelty of our work is to provide the first study of loss estimation assuming a general model of gaussian decoherence , which includes additional loss , thermal effects and even the possibility of environmental correlations .",
    "thanks to this general model , we can potentially account for many effects , including detector inefficiencies , thermal background ( which is non - trivial at the microwave regime ) and also the presence of non - markovian dynamics in the environment .",
    "in such a general scenario , we fix the benchmark to be the performance of coherent states : the generation of minimum uncertainty states can be regarded as the minimal requirement for a single - mode source to be considered ` quantum ' . while the direct use of single - mode thermal sources is clearly sub - optimal ,",
    "we show that the coherent - state benchmark can easily be achieved by two - mode thermal sources which are asymmetric and correlated .",
    "surprisingly , these sources are even able to largely outperform the coherent - state benchmark when ( separable ) correlations are present in the environment .",
    "let us start with a detailed description of the correlated - thermal source ( see also fig .  [ basicpic ] ) .",
    "we consider two single - mode thermal states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with mean numbers of photons equal to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . these are chosen to satisfy @xmath4 and we may specifically consider @xmath5 .",
    "the two thermal states are combined with a generally unbalanced beam splitter , with transmissivity @xmath6 .",
    "the three parameters of the source ( @xmath7 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are chosen in such a way that the mean number of photons transmitted on mode @xmath8 , equal to @xmath9 , is fixed to some low value ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) , while no energetic constraint is imposed for mode @xmath11 .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the most interesting situation is when the source is highly asymmetric .",
    "this means that we take @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in such a way that @xmath14 is kept small , while mode @xmath11 is very energetic with @xmath15 photons transmitted .",
    "locally , the reduced state @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is a faint ( bright ) thermal state , but globally the state @xmath18 is highly correlated .",
    "one can check that the quadrature operators associated with the two modes ( @xmath19,@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) have covariances @xmath23 , whose absolute value is @xmath24 .     which is correlated and generally asymmetric .",
    "this is prepared using a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath6 , which mixes a bright thermal state ( with photon number @xmath2 ) with a faint thermal state ( with photon number @xmath25 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the three parameters of the source ( @xmath7 , @xmath26 and @xmath3 ) are chosen in such a way that the mean number of photons @xmath27 on mode @xmath8 is fixed to some low value , while the energy of mode @xmath11 is not constrained .",
    "on the right , the input thermal source and an optimal output measurement are employed  for estimating the unknown transmissivity @xmath28 of the red box ( lossy channel ) .",
    "this is done in the presence of gaussian decoherence , modelled by two beam splitters with transmissivity @xmath29 and injecting thermal noise with variance @xmath30 .",
    "the environmental thermal modes @xmath31 and @xmath32 may be uncorrelated or correlated.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the generated thermal source @xmath33 is then used to probe a lossy channel @xmath34 with unknown transmissivity @xmath35 $ ] on mode @xmath8 . in a realistic scenario , this is affected by decoherence , here modelled by a generally - joint gaussian channel @xmath36 affecting both modes @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "this can be represented by two beam splitters with transmissivity @xmath29 mixing @xmath8 and @xmath11 with ancillary modes , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , coming from the environment .",
    "these ancillas inject thermal noise @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the mean number of photons of the bath .",
    "furthermore , the two environmental ancillas may also be correlated , which means that their quadrature operators , i.e. , @xmath39,@xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , have non - zero covariance , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "thus , the output gaussian state is given by @xmath45 .    at the output a joint quantum measurement @xmath46",
    "is performed on modes @xmath8 and @xmath11 whose outcome provides an estimate of @xmath28 . in the basic formulation of quantum metrology ,",
    "this process is assumed to be performed many times , so that a large number @xmath47 of input states @xmath48 are prepared and their outputs @xmath49 are subject to a collective quantum measurement @xmath50 , whose output is classically processed into an unbiased estimator @xmath51 of @xmath28 . for large @xmath52 , the resulting error - variance @xmath53 satisfies the quantum cramer - rao ( qcr ) bound @xmath54   ^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath55 is the quantum fisher information ( qfi )  @xcite .",
    "the qfi can be expressed as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the quantum fidelity between the two gaussian states @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which can be computed using the general formula of ref .",
    "it is important to note that the qcr bound can always be achieved , asymptotically , by an optimal measurement @xmath60@xcite .    in the following",
    "we show the performances achievable by our correlated - thermal sources under various assumptions for the gaussian decoherence model , starting from the simple case of a pure - loss environment , to including thermal noise and , finally , noise - correlations .",
    "these performances are compared with the use of a single - mode thermal source and , most importantly , with a coherent - state benchmark .",
    "the latter can easily be evaluated .",
    "considering the scenario at the right of fig .",
    "[ basicpic ] , but neglecting mode @xmath11 and considering an input coherent state @xmath61 with @xmath62 on mode @xmath8 , we derive the benchmark  @xcite@xmath63 in this formula , we can see how the error - scaling @xmath64 , typical of the standard quantum limit , is moderated by the factor @xmath65 taking into account of gaussian decoherence .",
    "let us start with the simplest decoherence model , which only considers additional damping on top of the unknown lossy channel under estimation .",
    "in other words , we consider the two beam splitters with @xmath66 in a zero temperature bath ( @xmath67 ) and without noise correlations ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is the most typical situation at the optical regime , where thermal background is negligible .",
    "such a pure - loss decoherence may be found in many scenarios .",
    "for instance , it may be the effect of detector inefficiencies , beam spreading , or the use of fiber components .",
    "in other cases , it may due to the typical configuration of an optical instrument .",
    "for example , in a photometer , the measure of a concentration within a sample ( via its optical transmission ) is typically performed with respect to a blank sample whose intrinsic transmissivity is known and fixed .",
    "let us estimate the transmissivity parameter @xmath28  by constraining the mean number of photons in the signal mode @xmath8 , e.g. , @xmath10 , and assuming additional ( known ) loss in modes @xmath8 and @xmath11 , e.g. , quantified by @xmath69 .",
    "we then construct correlated - thermal sources combining a strongly attenuated thermal state @xmath70 ( approximately the vacuum state )  and a thermal state with @xmath71 , where the parameter @xmath7  of the beam splitter is variable and completely describes the source .",
    "the corresponding qfi @xmath72 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ pic1 ] , where the performances of these sources are compared with that of the single - mode thermal state ( achievable by setting @xmath73 ) and that of the coherent state probes , according to eq .",
    "( [ bench ] ) with @xmath74 .     versus transmissivity @xmath28 for probes irradiating @xmath10 signal photons .",
    "we plot the performances of the correlated - thermal source for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( solid red lines ) ; larger @xmath78 indicates better precision .",
    "these are compared with  the single - mode thermal state ( dotted blue line ) and the coherent - state benchmark ( dashed blue line , which coincides with the solid red line for @xmath79 ) .",
    "here we consider @xmath69 , @xmath67 ( zero temperature bath ) , and @xmath80 ( corresponding to no correlations in the environment).,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ pic1 ] , the correlated - thermal source is optimal in the most asymmetric configurations , where the beam splitter is highly unbalanced ( e.g. , @xmath79 ) so that strong correlations are generated between the signal mode @xmath8 and the ancillary mode @xmath11 , while keeping the signal energy low at @xmath10 photons .",
    "the coherent - state benchmark is easily approached already with reasonable asymmetries ( e.g. , @xmath81 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the performance achievable by coherent photons on mode @xmath8 can also be achieved by employing an equivalent number of thermal photons ( as long as they are suitably correlated with the ancillary mode @xmath11 ) .",
    "note that highly - asymmetric beam splitters are typical in x - ray interferometry . a hard x - ray beam at @xmath82kev ( suitable for medical applications , such as mammography )",
    "can be split by silicon crystals via laue ",
    "bragg diffraction . for crystals of sufficient depth @xmath83 m",
    ", the diffraction efficiency ( reflectivity of the beam splitter ) can reach values of @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "we now include the presence of thermal noise in the decoherence process . besides various technical imperfections ( e.g. , stray photons emitted by the source ) ,",
    "this noise may come from a natural thermal background which is non - negligible at far infrared and microwave wavelengths . as an example , consider the frequency of @xmath84 thz . at room temperature ( @xmath85 k )",
    "there will be @xmath86  mean thermal photons entering the interferometric setup ( via the input ports @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the two beam splitters of fig .",

    ", we have @xmath88 .",
    "we then consider high loss ( @xmath89 ) and signals with @xmath90 photons . as we can see from fig .",

    "here we consider @xmath89 , @xmath92 ( room temperature at @xmath84 thz ) , and @xmath80 ( corresponding to no correlations in the environment).,scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "we finally consider noise correlations in the gaussian environment . there may be situations , e.g. , on a small scale , where two bosonic modes experience exactly the same fluctuations . in these ` non - markovian ' environments , we find that our correlated - thermal sources can even beat the coherent - state benchmark .",
    "more specifically , we consider noise - correlations of the type @xmath93 , which are maximal but still separable ( i.e. , the state of the environmental ancillas @xmath31 and @xmath32 is not entangled ) .",
    "these specific environmental correlations constructively combine with those of the input two - mode thermal source in a way as to reduce the net effect of decoherence .",
    "consider @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( e.g. , corresponding to @xmath85 ghz at room temperature ) .",
    "we shall assume we have correlated - thermal sources with @xmath96 ( e.g. , via a cryogenic preparation ) , variable @xmath7 , and irradiating @xmath97 photons on mode @xmath8 . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ pic3 ] , all choices of sources beat the coherent - state benchmark . in particular ,",
    "the best solution is the fully - symmetric thermal source with @xmath75 , which is the most effective at counterbalancing the specific symmetric noise of the environment .",
    "we can easily extend this analysis to considering an environment with asymmetric thermal noise , in which case the best performance is achieved by asymmetric thermal sources  @xcite .",
    "we can also check that the coherent benchmark is not beaten if the environmental correlations are of the positive type  @xmath98 , therefore not sustaining those negative  @xmath99  of the input correlated state  @xcite .     versus transmissivity @xmath28 for probes irradiating @xmath97 signal photons .",

    "we have shown that thermal sources can be engineered in such a way that their correlations may non - trivially improve the performance of loss estimation in practical setups of quantum metrology considering various scenarios of gaussian decoherence .",
    "correlated - thermal sources with strong energetic asymmetry are able to approach the performance of coherent state probes in markovian models of gaussian decoherence , where the bosonic modes are affected by independent and identical noise fluctuations . in the presence of correlated noise in the environment , as typical of non - markovian dynamics",
    ", we have shown that the correlated - thermal sources can even beat the coherent state benchmark , a feature which may be achieved by correctly combining the types of correlations created in the source with those present in the environment .    according to our investigations ,",
    "the behavior represented in the previous numerical examples is generic as long as the mean number of photons on mode @xmath8 is reasonably low , and the preparation of the correlated - thermal source involves a faint thermal state with sufficiently low thermal number @xmath103 ( ideally , this should be the vacuum state ) .",
    "one may argue that the correlations employed in our sources still have a quantum component , e.g. , as quantified by quantum discord  @xcite ( which is exactly computable for these types of gaussian states  @xcite ) . in this respect ,",
    "we notice that discord may be considered as the cheapest non - classical feature to be generated in a bipartite source . indeed , in our case",
    ", it just corresponds to the ability of combining thermal states at a beam splitter , which just requires sufficient spatial - temporal coherence in the bosonic modes .",
    "clearly , this is much less demanding than the ability to generate minimum uncertainty states or even squeezing .",
    "further work will include the analysis of loss estimation with a finite number of signals , and the explicit design of simple detection strategies able to approach the theoretical performance of the quantum cramer - rao bound .",
    "it would also be very interesting to analyze the explicit performance of correlated - thermal sources for practical tasks of quantum hypothesis testing  @xcite , such as the quantum reading of optical memories  @xcite and the quantum illumination of targets  @xcite .",
