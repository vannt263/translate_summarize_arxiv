    "conduction electrons moving in a ferromagnet interact with the magnetization through the exchange interaction .",
    "if the exchange field is strong and slowly varying in space and time , the electron spin will adiabatically follow the direction of the magnetization",
    ". we may then consider electrons with spins up and down along the magnetization direction as two distinct species of particles , and for convenience call them spin up / down electrons .",
    "as is well known , a spin up / down electron wave packet acquires a berry phase@xcite that influences their orbital motion . in effect , the electrons experience a lorentz force due to  fictitious \" electromagnetic fields which are local functions of the magnetization.@xcite    in this fictitious electrodynamics , spin up / down electrons have opposite charges and different conductivities .",
    "their motion and associated currents interact with the magnetization through what is commonly called current - driven spin - transfer torques .",
    "we call this interplay between spin currents and magnetization _ spin magnetohydrodynamics _ , in analogy to the classical theory of magnetohydrodynamics,@xcite where the magnetic fields couple to electric currents in conducting fluids , and the currents in turn generate magnetic fields . in our spin magnetohydrodynamics ,",
    "the maxwell s equations for the magnetic field are replaced by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation for the magnetization . in this paper , we neglect full dynamics of the real electromagnetic fields , focusing on the spin - related phenomena .",
    "the electron spin follows the magnetization direction perfectly only in the limit of an infinitely large exchange field . in reality",
    ", there will be some misalignment and associated spin relaxation .",
    "this is usually described phenomenologically as a dissipative spin torque with a coefficient @xmath0 in the landau - lifshitz equation.@xcite in a one - dimensional ring geometry , we will derive the complete set of coupled spin - magnetohydrodynamical equations , starting from the semi - phenomenological dynamical equations for nonequilibrium currents and magnetization .",
    "we recast the reactive spin torque mediated by the berry phase in this thermodynamic context . in our theory",
    ", we take an alternative view that the @xmath0 term arises from a correction to the berry - phase electromotive force ( emf ) in the equation of motion for the charge current , with the appropriate dissipative spin torque established by the onsager reciprocity .",
    "this physics is presently vigorously studied ( experimentally as well as theoretically ) in the contexts of current - driven magnetic excitations and domain - wall motion@xcite and the reciprocal spin accumulations and voltages generated by the fictitious gauge fields.@xcite since the mesoscopic regime ( mainly dealing with variants of magnetic spin valves , tunnel junctions , and magnetic multilayers ) is at present well explored,@xcite we will limit our attention here to the case of continuous magnetic systems .",
    "since the underlying physics is rich and complex in the most general setting , we will limit our discussion to a simple setting , which we believe captures all the essential ingredients of the spin magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "consider a uniform current in a ferromagnetic ring , assuming for simplicity incompressible electric flows ( the continuity equation prohibits current inhomogeneities for an incompressible electron fluid ) .",
    "the electric current is then the only dynamical variable describing the electron fluid .",
