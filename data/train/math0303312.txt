    "the set @xmath6 of non - crossing partitions of @xmath7 has been studied as an important example of a lattice , at least since the work of kreweras @xcite .",

    ", we will use in this paper the notation @xmath9 ( instead of just @xmath6 ) .    in work related to combinatorial aspects of non - commutative probability , biane @xcite",
    ", @xcite noticed that it is advantageous to embed @xmath9 into the group @xmath10 of permutations of @xmath7 ; we thus arrive to talk about the the set of disc non - crossing _ permutations , _",
    "@xmath11 . while @xmath11 is `` almost the same thing '' as @xmath12 it is nevertheless worth being considered , because it has a non - trivial equivalent characterization in terms of a `` geodesic condition '' in the cayley graph of @xmath10 ( cf . the review of this done in section 2.10 below ) .",
    "in this paper we study the set @xmath0 of permutations of @xmath13 which are non - crossing in an annulus with @xmath2 points marked on its external circle and @xmath3 points marked on its internal circle .",
    "the first thing to clarify is what is the formal algebraic definition of @xmath0 .",
    "this has to be an analogue for the fact that a permutation @xmath14 of @xmath7 is in @xmath11 precisely when every cycle of @xmath14 is `` standard '' ( in a natural sense ) , and when @xmath14 does not display the crossing pattern `` @xmath15 '' with @xmath16 ( cf . the review done in sections 2.42.8 ) .",
    "it turns out that in the annular framework there are three possible crossing patterns , rather than just one  see the conditions ( ac-1 ) , ( ac-2 ) , ( ac-3 ) in definition 3.5 .",
    "we define a permutation @xmath14 of @xmath5 to be in @xmath0 when every cycle of @xmath14 is `` standard '' in the appropriate annular sense , and when @xmath14 does not display any of these crossing patterns . by starting from this definition",
    ", we then prove that @xmath0 can also be described via an annular counterpart of biane s geodesic condition ; this is done in the theorem 6.1 of the paper . on the way towards that",
    ", we observe that at the algebraic level there exists a nice connection between @xmath0 and the set of disc non - crossing permutations @xmath17 .",
    "namely : @xmath0 is the saturation of @xmath17 under conjugation with the permutations @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; cf .",
    "theorem 5.1 .",
    "it is well - known that disc non - crossing partitions ( or permutations ) play a role in describing the asymptotics for moments in several important examples of random matrices .",
    "the annular non - crossing permutations turn out to play a similar role in the description of the second order asymptotics for these matrices .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon on a family of complex wishart matrices ( a family @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are @xmath23 random matrices with independent complex gaussian entries ) ; this is done in the section 7 of the paper . at the end of the section 7 we comment on how the same phenomenon also appears in connection to gaussian hermitian random matrices",
    "; this example is not so illustrative for the purposes of the present paper , as it involves only the special case of complete matchings ( permutations @xmath14 such that every orbit of @xmath14 has exactly two elements ) , rather than dealing with general permutations .    in view of the analogy with the disc case",
    ", we can not omit a discussion of the concept of annular non - crossing partition .",
    "this is done in the section 4 of the paper .",
    "we define a partition @xmath24 of @xmath5 to be annular non - crossing if there exists @xmath25 such that @xmath24 is the orbit partition of @xmath14 .",
    "the set @xmath4 of partitions of @xmath5 which is obtained in this way coincides with the one studied by king @xcite ( the difference between the approaches taken here and in @xcite is that our definition of @xmath4 is algebraic , while king s is phrased in topological terms  cf .",
    "remark 4.3.2 ) .",
    "we point out that the natural surjection from @xmath0 onto @xmath4 is not one - to - one , and we identify precisely the kind of pathology which causes this to happen .    since ( unlike what we had in the disc case ) @xmath0 and @xmath4",
    "can not be identified to each other , one has has to choose which kind of object ( partitions or permutations ? ) should play the primary role in the development of the annular non - crossing theory . in the support of our choice for permutations we can bring the following two arguments :    \\(a ) the complementation map introduced by kreweras in the disc case has a very nice counterpart at the level of permutations ( a bijection from @xmath0 to itself  see remark 6.7 ) .",
    "but when trying to define the kreweras complementation as a map on @xmath4 , one finds ( as noticed already in @xcite ) that the map is not defined everywhere , and is not a bijection on the part of @xmath4 where it is defined . this fact is directly related to the lack of injectivity of the natural map from @xmath0 to @xmath4 .",
    "\\(b ) the second order asymptotics for random matrices found in section 7 involve summations naturally indexed by @xmath0 ( cf . equation ( 7.5 ) in theorem 7.5 ) ; these could be turned into summations over @xmath4 only by introducing some artificial weights .    in the section 8 of the paper",
    "we briefly discuss some possible generalizations of our results from the framework of the annulus to the more general one of a multi - annulus .",
    "then in the final section 9 we see how the formulas for the joint moments of a wishart family extend to the multi - annular framework . as an application ,",
    "we observe how a phenomenon of asymptotic gaussianity for traces of words made with independent wishart matrices can be obtained via some fairly straightforward combinatorial arguments ( cf .",
    "corollary 9.4 ) .",
    "as pointed to us by vaughan jones , the combinatorics of annular non - crossing permutations developped in this paper has striking resemblances with the combinatorics of `` tangles '' , objects appearing in jones theory of planar algebras ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this coincidence suggests that the second - order asymptotics of random matrices could perhaps be of use in constructions of von neumann subfactors ( but at the present moment there is no precise idea on how to substantiate such a possibility ) .",
