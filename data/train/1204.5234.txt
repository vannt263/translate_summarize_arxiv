    "outflows appear to be a common phenomenon in quasars . on small scale ,",
    "mass loss due to outflows is an important component in the overall structure of quasars ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "recently , outflows have been regarded as one of the main components in the unification of various subclasses of quasars ( richards et al .",
    "2011 ) . on large scales ,",
    "outflows are considered to be able to clear out inter - stellar medium ( ism ; silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; di matteo et al . 2005 ) and enrich the inter - galactic medium ( igm ; friaca & terlevich 1998 ) , and consequently affect the star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "quasar outflows are important for our understanding of the co - evolution of galaxies and their central black holes",
    ".    there exist , in quasar spectra , prominent features associated with outflows , e.g. broad absorption lines ( bals ) and blueshifted broad emission lines ( bels ) . studies on the two different features reveal quite similar dependencies of outflow properties on some fundamental quantities .",
    "bal quasars with larger outflow velocity tend to have higher eddington ratio and weaker intrinsic x - ray relative to uv ( ganguly et al . 2007 ; fan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "and the fraction of bal quasars also increases with eddington ratio ( ganguly et al .",
    "2007 ; zhang et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the blueshift of civbels is more strongly correlated with the eddington ratio than the bal properties ( wang et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter wang11 ) and also depend on the shape of the ionizing continuum ( leighly & moore 2004 ; richards et al .",
    "furthermore , the blueshift is apparently stronger in radio - quiet quasars than in radio - loud ones ( marziani et al .",
    "these observational results provide strong support for the scenario that the outflow is directly related to the accretion process and driven by radiation pressure .",
    "is the launch of outflows affected by other factors , in particular the environment where quasars reside in ? in this letter , we uncover a strong correlation between the outflow strength and the quasar metallicity .",
    "this correlation is actually not unexpected considering that high metallicity can increase the acceleration of outflows .",
    "one good example with strong outflows and enriched metallicity is the ultraluminous infrared quasar q1321@xmath0058 ( wang et al . 2009 ) .",
    "since metals are produced by star formation process , this correlation strongly suggests that star formation in galaxies can affect the evolution of the central black holes .",
    "the connection between galaxies and black holes might be more intimate and complex than previous expectation .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section [ secsam ]",
    "we show the sample selection and present composite spectra as a function of the blueshift and asymmetry index ( bai ) of the civline , which has been shown to be a good indicator of the strength of quasar outflows ( wang11 ) .",
    "we also measure the line flux from the composites . in section [ sec_bmc ]",
    "we present strong correlations of various line flux ratios with bai .",
    "these results provide strong evidence to support that outflow strength increases with the metallicity .",
    "finally , we summarize the results and discuss their implications in section [ secsum ] .",
    "we select quasars in the redshift range @xmath1 from the fifth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; schneider et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the redshift range is chosen in such a way that the civ  line falls in the wavelength coverage of the sdss spectrograph . to ensure reliable measurements of emission line parameters , we select objects with median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n)@xmath27 per pixel in the civ  ( 1450 - 1700 ) spectral region . we discard bal quasars as cataloged by scaringi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , since bals would significantly modify the civ  line profile .",
    "12844 quasars meet these criteria .",
    "the sdss spectra are transformed to the rest frame using the improved redshifts for sdss quasars as computed by hewett & wild ( 2010 , hereafter hw10 ) .    to measure the civ  line",
    ", we first fit the local continuum with a power - law in two wavelength windows near 1450  and 1695 . after subtracting the continuum",
    ", we fit the residual spectrum around civ  with two gaussians .",
    "since the red wing of civ  is contaminated by heii , only the spectral region of 1450 - 1580  is considered in fitting the civ  line .",
    "the fitting results for most of the objects are reasonable according to our visual inspection . however",
    ", a small fraction of objects can not be well fitted by our automated procedure . to minimize the number of outliers",
    ", we eliminate objects with unacceptable fitting , i.e. @xmath3d.o.f@xmath4 .",
    "this restriction leads to a final working sample of 11268 quasars .",
    "following wang11 , we use the blueshift and asymmetry index to measure the deviation of the civ  line from an unshifted and symmetric profile .",
    "bai is defined as the flux ratio of the blue part to the total profile , where the blue part is the part of civ  line at wavelengths short of 1549.06 , the rest - frame wavelength of the civ  doublets .",
    "the bai estimation may be affected by the accuracy of the redshifts which we use to transform the observed spectra to the rest frame . to reduce the possible uncertainty of bai thus introduced , we adopt the redshifts provided by hw10 , which were derived by cross correlating observed spectra with a carefully - constructed template .",
    "it has been demonstrated by wang11 that the redshifts of hw10 do not introduce any significant bias in measuring bai .",
    ".continuum windows and number of gaussians [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with increased s / n , composite spectra are useful for studying weak lines and the overall properties of quasars by averaging out object - to - object variations ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter vb01 ; nagao et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter n06 ) .",
    "since we are interested in the relative intensities of bels , the composites are constructed using the arithmetic mean method .",
    "we first divide the quasar sample into five equally - sized subsamples according to their bai . for each quasar",
    ", we use the hw10 redshift to deredshift the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is then normalized at 1450 , rebinned into the same wavelength bins . in figure",
    "[ fig_cs ] , we show the composite spectra covering the wavelength range from 1000 to 3000 . in our sample , bai is weakly correlated with redshift and luminosity , so the number of quasars in each wavelength bin as a function of wavelength is similar for different composites ( figure [ fig_num ] ) .",
    "at least 220 and 940 spectra are combined in the bins of the composites near 1000  and 3000 , respectively .",
    "this enables detections of weak features in the composite spectra at high statistical significance . following vb01 and laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we locate and identify most of significant line features in the composites .    as civ  bai increases , other high ionization lines , such as heii",
    ", nv  and ovi , also significantly shift towards shorter wavelength .",
    "especially , the blue wing of these lines are prominently enhanced as bai increases , suggesting that bai is a good indicator of outflow strength . while , in our composites , low ionization lines , such as oi , ciii ]  and mgii , do nt exhibit apparent shift with respect to the rest frame .",
    "it is consistent with previous findings ( marziani et al .",
    "1996 ; richards et al . 2002 ; shen et al .",
    "these results support that there is no significant bias in hw10 redshifts and bai .",
    "we then measure the fluxes of the metal lines ( or line complex ) listed in tab .",
    "[ tab_fit ] from the composites .",
    "generally , we first fit the continuum with a power - law in two continuum windows . after subtracting the continuum",
    ", we fit the residual line spectrum with multi - gaussians model .",
    "the central wavelengths of the continuum windows and the number of gaussians for each line are listed in table [ tab_fit ] .",
    "note that we only use the spectral region of 1450 - 1580  to fit the civ  line , as shown in section [ sec_ss ] .",
    "we do nt measure nv , siii , cii ]  and mgii  ( also labelled in figure [ fig_cs ] ) , because these lines are severely blended with either strong ly@xmath5  or strong feiibump . due to the uncertainty in the origin of the 1600  bump ( see n06 ) , it is hard to determine the line profile of heii .",
    "we do nt investigate heii  and oiii ]  too .",
    "the errors of the line fluxes shown in figure [ fig_lr ] are propagated from the uncertainties of the composites .",
    "each composite is built from more than 2000 quasars , the flux errors are therefore very small .",
    "the errors include none from the uncertainties in continuum estimate , which is difficult to quantify . however , the continuum placement is important for weak line estimates . in the spectral region of 1690 - 2030 ,",
    "several weak lines are mildly blended . to decompose these lines , we select spectral regions near 1695  and 2030 , where the emission line contribution to the total flux appears to be small , as continuum windows .",
    "we mask the region of 1760 - 1800 , where feii  emission is prominent , then simultaneously fit the niv , niii ] , siii@xmath0[neiii ]  and ciii]@xmath0siiii ]  lines .",
    "figure [ fig_cs ] shows an example for the spectral decomposition .",
    "our best - fit model reproduces the composite .",
    "oi@xmath0siii  in small bai composites appears to lie on the red wing of the strong line complex ly@xmath5@xmath0nv , we therefore adopt local continuums around the line as continuum windows ( see table [ tab_fit ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the high continuum around oi@xmath0siii  at small bai might be partly contributed by the broad profile of oi@xmath0siii .",
    "if this is the case , the oi@xmath0siii  intensity at small bai is underestimated and more detailed decomposition is required to study its dependence on bai .",
    "the line fluxes as a function of bai are shown in the left panel of figure [ fig_lr ] .",
    "one can see the line intensities are correlated with bai , and there seems to exist opposite trends between strong and weak lines .",
    "strong lines ( civ , ovi@xmath0ly@xmath6 , ciii]@xmath0siiii ]  and siiv@xmath0oiv ] ) either decrease or remain constant with the increase of bai , while weak lines ( the other lines shown in figure [ fig_lr ] ) are dramatically enhanced at large bai .",
    "the opposite trends also appears to exist in the lines , which are not measured : the strong line mgii  and the weak lines siii , siiii ]  and cii ]  ( see figure [ fig_cs ] and wang11 ) .",
    "it is well known that line equivalent widths decrease with quasar luminosity , known as the baldwin effect ( baldwin 1977 ; dietrich et al . 2002 ) .",
    "if bai was correlated with luminosity , one would expect that line intensities are correlated with bai .",
    "we compute the median luminosity of each subsample , and find that quasars in the largest - bai subsample are , on average , only 45% more luminous than those in the smallest - bai subsample . apparently , bai is weakly related to luminosity and baldwin effect is not important for the trends reported in this paper .",
    "we then show the line ratios of other ions to civ  as a function of bai in the right panel of figure [ fig_lr ] .",
    "all line ratios , except ovi@xmath0ly@xmath6/civ , positively correlate with bai with a high statistical significance . among these ratios , siiv@xmath0oiv]/civ , aliii / civ , cii / civ  and ciii]@xmath0siiii]/civ  have been demonstrated , by the photoionization model , to significantly increase with increasing metallicity ( e.g. n06 ) .",
    "this means that there exists strong correlation between bai and metallicity .",
    "the intensities of the strong metal lines depend weakly on metallicity because of the thermostat effect introduced by the strong cooling lines ( korista et al .",
    "1998 ; ferland 1999 ) . in metal - rich gas , civ  and ovily@xmath6  is severely affected by ly@xmath5  forest ,",
    "its intrinsic intensity should be much higher than the measured value .",
    "] , the most important coolants , even tend to decrease with increasing metallicity because their relative importance as coolants decreases . while , the weak lines can prominently increase with metallicity because the number density of corresponding ions increases and the thermostat effect for them is trivial .",
    "therefore , the metallicity - bai correlation can well explain the trends of the line intensities shown in the left panel of figure [ fig_lr ] .",
    "we note that metallicity can not be the only factor affecting line emission , other factors , such as the ionizing continuum and the overall properties of belr gas , also play an important role .",
    "considerable efforts had been devoted to developing line ratios , such as nv / civ  and siiv@xmath0oiv]/civ , as metal abundance diagnostics ( hamann et al . 2002 ; n06 ) . here ,",
    "we adopt siiv@xmath0oiv]/civ  as a metallicity indicator . two theoretical line ratio - metallicity relationships , calculated by photoionization models using two types of ionizing continuums , are adopted ( n06 , table 10 ) . as shown in figure [ fig_mbai ] , the correlation between the inferred metallicity and bai is weakly dependent on the ionizing continuum .",
    "when bai increases from 0.49 to 0.76 , the metallicity remarkably increases from 1.7 to 6.9@xmath7 .",
    "we use this indicator rather than that involving nv  because siiv@xmath0oiv ]  is a well isolated feature and the origin of the nv  line might be complex ( wang et al .",
    "the theoretical calculation in n06 shows that cii / civ , aliii / civ  and ciii]@xmath0siiii]/civ  are also correlated with metallicity . for comparison",
    ", we also show the metallicities inferred from ciii]@xmath0siiii]/civ  and aliii / civ  as a function of bai in figure [ fig_mbai ]",
    ". the measured ratios of cii  to civ  for the two smallest - bai subsamples are less than the theoretical ratios at 0.2@xmath7 , which is the lowest metallicity adopted in the theoretical calculation , so we do nt calculate the ` ciimetalliciy ' .",
    "one can see that the ` aliii  metallicity ' is in good agreement with the ` siiv@xmath0oiv ]  metalliciy ' , implying that the aliii  measurement is reliable .",
    "the ` ciii]@xmath0siiii ]  metallicity ' also increases with bai , although it is apparently lower than the ` siiv@xmath0oiv ]  metalliciy ' .",
    "n06 also found that ` cii  and ciii]@xmath0siiii ]  metallicities ' are much lower than ` aliii  and siiv@xmath0oiv ]  metallicities ' .",
    "cii  and ciii]@xmath0siiii ]  are emitted by gas with different ionization degree or gas density from civ .",
    "this indicates that cii / civ  and ciii]@xmath0siiii]/civare sensitive to the belr properties adopted by photoionization model , such as the density and spatial distributions of belr clouds ( see n06 for more details ) .",
    "in contrast , siiv@xmath0oiv]/civis less sensitive to the variation in the belr structure , and thus is a more robust metallicity indicator .",
    "we measure various line fluxes and the blueshift and asymmetry index ( bai ) of the civline from composite quasar spectra built from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "most of investigated line - flux ratios increase significantly with bai . based on phototionization models , we interpret these dependencies in terms of stronger outflow in higher gas metallicity environment .",
    "this correlation can also account for the positive trends for weak lines and negative trends for strong lines , which are observed in the composites .",
    "we then use the flux ratio of siiv@xmath0oiv ]  to civ  as abundance diagnostics and find that metallicity increases more than 3 times as bai increases from 0.49 to 0.76 .",
    "we recall that a remarkably similar correlation has been well established in radiation - driven stellar wind ( massey 2003 ) .",
    "high metallicity leads to large gas opacity , thus large absorption and acceleration .",
    "recent studies on quasar outflows also favor the paradigm of radiative acceleration ( wang11 ) .",
    "so the metallicity - outflow correlation can be naturally understood in terms of the metallicity - acceleration relationship .",
    "another possibility is that starburst in the galactic center can produce abundant metals and drive the gases to fuel the black hole ( wang et al .",
    "because outflows are boosted at high accretion rates , the bai@xmath8metallicity relationship can also be produced .",
    "the two mechanisms may both work .",
    "although it is difficult to disentangle the predominant physical mechanism from the current data , the first mechanism is apparently more direct .",
    "whichever mechanism dominates , star formation occurred in the host galaxies , which produces metals , has an important impact on the driving of quasar outflow .",
    "the quasar metallicity may dramatically affect the host galaxy properties via feedback .",
    "on one hand , outflows from the quasar could exert enough force on the ism to remove some of the material from the galaxy , consequently inhibiting the growth of the galaxy .",
    "this process would be more effective at higher metallicity according to our results .",
    "on the other hand , metal - rich outflows and ejected ism may chemically enrich the igm as the belr metallicity is much higher than the solar value ( hamann et al .",
    "the enrichment makes the radiative cooling of the igm more efficient , and further enhances star formation in galaxies and the growth of their central black holes , in contrast to the momentum feedback process that blows away the ism .",
    "the enrichment rate is proportional to both the mass loss rate of outflows and metallicity , and therefore increases with metallicity in a manner stronger than a linear relationship .",
    "this feedback process is particularly important at high redshifts because 1 ) the intense star formation at high redshifts may form a substantially metal - rich environment in the galactic nuclei ; 2 ) at high redshifts , igm is very metal poor and its cooling is less effective .",
