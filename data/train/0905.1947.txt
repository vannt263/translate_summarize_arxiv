    "understanding the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies from their integrated spectrophotometries is one of the overarching goals of modern astronomy and astrophysics . over the last two decades",
    ", we have learned that massive elliptical galaxies have enhanced @xmath0-element abundances , such as mg , compared to the sun ( worthey et al .",
    "1994 ; worthey 1998 ; lee & worthey 2005 ) . according to @xmath4cdm cosmology",
    ", it is usually suggested that star formation was most intense at the deep potentials inhabited by massive ellipticals .",
    "their intense star formation skewed the chemical abundance pattern toward the yields from massive core - collapse supernovae .",
    "central to this line of investigation , the lick / ids spectral indices have been widely used to derive the mean age and metallicity of stellar systems such as star clusters and galaxies .",
    "it is therefore essential to validate the simple stellar population ( ssp ; single age and single metallicity ) models by comparing conclusions derived from theoretical integrated lick spectral indices with results obtained from resolved stellar population studies .",
    "the most suitable nearby sample is arguably the milky way globular clusters ( mwgcs ) .",
    "they are generally old , span a broad range of metallicity , and show some @xmath0-element enhancement .",
    "there have been many efforts in the literature to understand the integrated spectroscopic properties of mwgcs ( e.g. , burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; gibson et al . 1999 ; vazdekis et al . 2001 ; lee , yoon , & lee 2000 ; schiavon et al .",
    "2002 ; thomas et al . 2003 ; lee & worthey 2005 ) .",
    "although there is mounting evidence that the mwgcs are perhaps not an ideal representatives of ssps ( e.g. , piotto 2009 ; yi 2009 ) , they are still very useful targets for the purpose of testing ssp models .    in order to compute the theoretical integrated lick / ids",
    "spectral indices from ssp models for the broad range of age and metallicity , three components are generally used .",
    "they are ( 1 ) stellar isochrones and/or evolutionary tracks , ( 2 ) stellar spectra , and ( 3 ) empirically derived lick spectral index fitting functions .",
    "the fitting functions of @xcite , h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , h@xmath7 . there are different sets of fitting functions in the literature ( e.g. , schiavon 2007 ) . ] have been built upon the lick stellar library that basically follows the galactic chemical enrichment histories throughout the broad metallicity coverage . in a nutshell , stars on the metal - poor side ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 @xmath9 1.0 )",

    "milky way globular clusters are known for their different degree of @xmath0-element enhancement from scaled - solar chemical abundances ( e.g. , pritzl , venn , & irwin 2005 ) . thus it is important to self - consistently include these abundances patterns at every stage of ssp model construction .",

    "( 2009 ) high resolution synthetic spectra .",
    "we describe how we generate reasonable hb morphologies in section 2.2 .",
    "the standard @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) was employed for calculating the relative number of stars along the isochrones .",
    "the variation of imf is , however , investigated and depicted in section 2.3 .",
    "the investigated ages are 8 , 11 , and 14 gyr and the metallicities cover @xmath12 [ fe / h ] @xmath13 with [ @xmath0/fe ] = 0.0 and + 0.4 .",
    "we defer the detailed studies on the effects of multiple populations ( piotto 2009 ) , he - enhancement ( yi 2009 ) , cnona chemical inhomogeneity ( pietrinferni et al . 2009 ) , blue stragglers ( cenarro et al . 2008 ) , and binary stars in gcs to future work .      in this study",
    ", we are illuminating the differences between scaled - solar and + 0.4 dex @xmath0-element enhancement at fixed [ fe / h ] in the ssp models by varying ( 1 ) isochrones alone , ( 2 ) synthetic spectra alone , and ( 3 ) both isochrones and spectra .",
    "the stellar evolution models that we employ were described by @xcite and we refer the reader to that paper for complete details .",
    "we have used their stellar evolution models at [ fe / h ] = @xmath92.5 , @xmath92.0 , @xmath91.5 , @xmath91.0 , @xmath90.5 , and 0 with [ @xmath0/fe ] = 0.0 and + 0.4 and ages from 8 to 14 gyr .",
    "these are complemented by a self - consistent set of he - burning tracks that extend from the zero - age hb ( zahb ) to the onset of thermal pulsations on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . in the models",
    ", @xmath0-enhancement refers to enhancements in the @xmath0-capture elements o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , and ti by the same amount as specified in [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "the models assume that the initial he mass fraction follows @xmath14 = 0.245 + 1.54@xmath15 , where @xmath14 = 0.245 is the primordial he abundance from big bang nucleosynthesis ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and the required initial he abundance of the calibrated solar model is @xmath14 = 0.274 .",
    "it must be emphasized that our @xmath0-enhanced stellar models in this work are set at fixed [ fe / h ] , rather than fixed metal mass fraction @xmath15 , so the @xmath0-elements add additional metals and make the isochrones cooler in general . in this",
    "setting , the temperature differences are more significant on the metal - rich side than on the metal - poor as illustrated in figure 1 .",

    "the left panel shows the @xmath0-element enhancement at [ fe / h ] = @xmath92.0 , while the right panel displays that at [ fe / h ] = 0.0 .",
    "investigations into the effects of individual elements on stellar spectra , with the intent of applying the results to galaxy spectra , include such works as @xcite and @xcite , who gauged the effects of ten individual elements on the lick system of 25 pseudo - equivalent width indices introduced by @xcite and @xcite . in order to investigate the effects of @xmath0-element enhancement on the lick / ids indices at solar and super - solar metallicity , lee & worthey ( 2005 ) employed the updated response functions by @xcite , which expanded the earlier work of tripicco & bell ( 1995 ) regarding the sensitivity of each lick spectral indices as the abundances of individual chemical elements are varied .",
    "the newly compiled synthetic spectra that we employ in this study were described in @xcite and we refer the reader to that paper for details . as noted in lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the synthetic spectra are not very accurate in absolute predictions ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) hence we employ a differential approach in which the fitting functions of @xcite and @xcite are used as the zero point , and delta - index information as a function of element ratio is incorporated via measuring the synthetic spectral library .",
    "this procedure is similar to that of previous investigations ( e.g. , @xcite ) but more sophisticated since an entire grid of delta - index information was used as opposed to 2 or 3 synthetic stars at solar abundance as in previous works .",
    "the lick stellar library generally follows the galactic chemical enrichment , i.e. , [ @xmath0/fe ] = + 0.4 for [ fe / h ] @xmath8 @xmath91.0 , [ @xmath0/fe ] = + 0.2 for [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.5 , and [ @xmath0/fe ] = 0.0 for [ fe / h ] = 0.0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to _ compensate for this intrinsic abundance trend rooted in the stellar library _ , we have employed the synthetic spectra of [ @xmath0/fe ] = @xmath90.4 for [ fe / h ] @xmath8 @xmath91.0 , that of [ @xmath0/fe ] = @xmath90.2 for [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.5 , and that of [ @xmath0/fe ] = 0.0 for [ fe / h ] = 0.0 for our _ solar - scaled _ ssp models . then for our _ 0.4 dex @xmath0-enhanced _ ssp models , we have used the synthetic spectra of [ @xmath0/fe ] = 0.0 for [ fe / h ] @xmath8 @xmath91.0 , that of [ @xmath0/fe ] = + 0.2 for [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.5 , and that of [ @xmath0/fe ] = + 0.4 for [ fe / h ] = 0.0 .",
    "following our earlier work ( lee et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 , 2004 ; lee & worthey 2005 ) , we fully account for the detailed systematic variation of hb morphology with age and metallicity . in lee",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) and lee et el .",
    "( 2002 ) , we basically followed the reimers massloss formula which led to a variation in massloss with age and metallicity . in this work ,",
    "we have instead employed the dotter ( 2008 ) mass loss scheme to represent the mwgc hb morphologies .",
    "we have adopted a massloss of 0.16 @xmath16 for [ fe / h ] = @xmath91.5 , @xmath91.0 , @xmath90.5 , and 0.0 ; 0.08 @xmath16 for [ fe / h ] = @xmath92.0 ; and 0.015 @xmath16 for [ fe / h ] = @xmath92.5 from figure 3 of dotter ( 2008 ) .",
    "0.02 @xmath16 is used for the mass dispersion .",
    "it is important to recognize that dotter ( 2008 ) was focused on a set of similarly old age gcs in that paper so that there was no claim of an age dependence on mass loss .",
    "nevertheless , this trend should be fine so long as it is applied to old gcs . examples of hb morphologies in the h - r diagram are shown in figure 1 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath92.0 ( left panel ) and 0.0 ( right panel ) for 11 gyr .",
    "the small squares are hb stars for the solar - scaled models , while the crosses are the + 0.4 dex @xmath0-enhanced models .",
    "similar to the isochrones , the @xmath0-enhanced hb stars at fixed [ fe / h ] are also generally cooler than their solar - scaled counterparts .",
    "the number of hb stars are estimated from the number for stars that evolved off the rgb using the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "we find that our @xmath17-parameter values ( i.e. , the number of hb stars over the number of rgb stars at the zero - age hb stars ) are similar to salaris et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . besides the number of hb stars",
    ", there are several parameters that can vary the hb morphologies at given age and metallicity such as different mass dispersion , different he , different mass - loss .",
    "observationally , indeed , there are variations of hb morphologies at given [ fe / h ] within the gc population .",
    "we assign , however , a single hb morphology at a given age and metallicity by delegating a mass dispersion , and a mass - loss as described above .",
    "the purpose of this study is not to investigate the detailed match between our ssp models and the observations of every single gc , but rather to examine the overall match for the entire range of metallicity .      for the calculation of the relative number of stars along the isochrones , we have adopted the standard @xcite power - law imf , where the number of stars ( @xmath18 ) in mass interval ( @xmath19 ) is described by @xmath20 with @xmath21",
    "= 2.35 in this study . however , we have also investigated the variation of imf as depicted in the below .",
    "the above simple power - law imf with @xmath21 = 2.35 has been varied with exponents of @xmath21 = 3.35 ( dwarf star - dominant = bottom - heavy imf ) and 1.35 ( giant star - dominant = top - heavy imf ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath21 = 3.35 case decreases the rgb number density down to 20% , and the @xmath21 = 1.35 case increases the rgb number density up to 375% , relative to that of the standard salpeter imf with @xmath21 = 2.35 .",
    "as the hb star number density scales with the rgb stars , it is seen in the bottom right panels of figures 2 @xmath9 12 that the hb effect becomes significantly more important for the top - heavy imf .",
    "having depicted the theoretical aspects of generating the scaled - solar and @xmath0-enhanced lick spectral indices in @xmath11 2 , we now present the results of our ssp models .",
    "the effects due to @xmath0-element enhancement in the isochrones and spectra , hb stars , and imf variation on several lick indices are illuminated in figures 2 @xmath9 12 .",
    "the figures are organized as follows : in the top left panel , the differences between scaled - solar and @xmath0-enhanced models ( both isochrones and spectra are enhanced ) without hb stars ( aa - wohb @xmath9 ss - wohb ) are displayed .",

    "figures 13 @xmath9 16 display [ fe / h ] vs. lick index plots in order to take advantage of independent measurements of [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] from individual stars in the milky way gcs .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values were taken from table 1 of s05 .",
    "our simple stellar population models with reasonable hb morphologies are shown for several lick indices as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the blue lines are solar - scaled models with hb stars ( ss - whb ) , while the pink lines are + 0.4 dex @xmath0-enhanced models ( aa - whb ; both isochrones and spectra are enhanced ) . ages of our models are noted next to the @xmath0-enhanced models : filled circles are for 8 gyr , open squares are for 11 gyr , and filled squares are for 14 gyr , respectively .",
    "the ssp models were computed at [ fe / h ] = @xmath92.5 , @xmath92.0 , @xmath91.5 , @xmath91.0 , @xmath90.5 , and 0.0 and are connected by straight lines in the figures .",
    "we describe how our ssp model lick indices of mg @xmath1 and ca4227 , balmer lines , and fe lines are compare with observations of milky way gcs in sections 4.1 , 4.2 , and 4.3 , respectively .",
    "comparisons of our model _ metal line indices _ with milky way gcs are of great importance .",
    "this is because age estimation using the diagnostic diagram of a metal line index vs. a balmer line index could be misleading unless the calibrations of model _ metal line indices _ are carefully considered .",
    "we remind readers again , however , that the purpose of this study is not investigating the detailed match between models and the observations for every individual gc , but rather to look into the overall match for the entire range of [ fe / h ] because of the caveats ( i.e. , no blue stragglers , binaries , multiple populations , cnona considerations , etc ) of our models as delineated in section 2 .      from the left panel of figure 13",
    ", it is seen that the overall match between mwgcs and our 0.4 dex @xmath0-enhanced ssp models is good .",
    "although it seems that the metal - poor gcs ( [ fe / h ] @xmath24 @xmath91.0 ) indicate [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath10 0.2 - 0.3 dex , it is again not an aim of this study to investigate the every individual milky way gc s location on our model grids .",
    "there is mounting evidence that not every @xmath0-element is equally enhanced in mwgcs and not every mwgc is of the similar amount of @xmath0-element enhancement ( e.g. , gratton , sneden , & carretta 2004 ; pritzl , venn , & irwin 2005 ) .",
    "our models represent the case when all the @xmath0 elements are equally enhanced by 0.4 dex .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have noted that mg @xmath1 is primarily sensitive to mg alone and other elements do not much affect it so that [ @xmath0/fe ] = 0.4 dex should be equivalent to [ mg / fe ] = 0.4 for mg @xmath1 .    from the right panel of figure 13 , it is indicated that [ @xmath0/fe ] ( [ ca / fe ] ) @xmath10 + 0.2 would reproduce the observations better . as pritzl et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed , it may be true that ca is less enhanced compared to mg in the stars of mwgcs .",
    "pipino et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recently suggest that the observed under - abundance of ca with respect to mg could be attributed to the different contributions from supernovae type ia and supernovae type ii to the nucleosynthesis of these two elements .",
    "the two most metal - rich milky way gcs in figure 13 are ngc 6553 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.20 ) and ngc 6528 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.10 ) .",
    "it seems that both of them indicate a lower amount of @xmath0-enhancement compared to their metal - poor counterparts . for ngc 6553 ,",
    "cohen et al . ( 1999 ) and alves - brito et al . (",
    "2006 ) report [ ca / fe ] = + 0.06 and + 0.05 , respectively . for ngc 6528 ,",
    "carretta et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and zoccali et al .",
    "( 2004 ) report [ mg / fe ] = @xmath90.04 and @xmath90.06 , respectively .",
    "balmer lines are widely used as an age indicator because of their superb temperature sensitivity in stars , tracing the temperature of the main - sequence turnoff better than many other indices .",
    "however , @xcite and earlier works @xcite found that they are also abundance sensitive to some degree . the horizontal - branch effect on h@xmath23",
    "was also investigated by lee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    figures 14 and 15 are similar to figures 1 and 2 of lee & worthey ( 2005 ) , but here we see the combination of isochrone and spectral effects of 0.4 dex @xmath0-element ( o , mg , si , s , ca , ti ) enhancement after the correction of the stellar library s intrinsic abundance patterns . from the top right panels of figures 4 @xmath9 8 , we have learned that blue hb stars significantly affect the balmer lines ( h@xmath23 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 ) for the old stellar populations on the metal - poor side .",
    "it is clear from figures 14 and 15 that the hb effect indeed improves the agreement between our models and observations .",
    "it is useful to note here that most milky way gcs have ages between @xmath1011 - 14 gyr ( e.g. , salaris & weiss 2002 ) .",
    "figure 14 shows that the overall match is rather good although that the observations are a little bit weaker than the models , particularly those for @xmath91.0 @xmath24 [ fe / h ] @xmath24 @xmath90.6 .",
    "we can see @xcite for a more detailed discussion , but a few words about outliers might be useful .",
    "the biggest outlier is ngc 6544 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath91.38 ; red open square ) in figure 14 , that shows significantly weaker h@xmath23 compared to other mwgcs with similar metallicity ( although only much slightly weaker at h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 in figure 15 ) .",
    "according to harris ( 1996 ; 2003 updated version ) mwgc compilation , ngc 6544 has considerably large reddening than other gcs in the s05 sample , e(b@xmath9v ) = 0.73 .",
    "moreover , figure 1 of hazen ( 1993 ) shows that there is a rather bright foreground star within 2 from the center of ngc 6544 .",
    "several mwgcs with @xmath91.0 @xmath24 [ fe / h ] @xmath24 @xmath90.6 also show some mismatches against models . among the other clusters in the sample ,",
    "it is interesting to find that ngc 6388 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.68 ; blue open circle ) and ngc 6441 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.65 ; green open circle ) , which have unusually sizable population of blue hb stars for their metallicities ( rich et al .",
    "1997 ) , have stronger h@xmath23 features than 47 tuc ( ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.70 ; red open circle ) , which has a purely red hb .    for two most metal - rich mwgcs in the sample ,",
    "a significant population of blue stragglers is seen in ngc 6553 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.20 ) ( beaulieu et al .",
    "2001 ; zoccali et al . 2001 ) and in ngc 6528 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.10 ) ( brown et al . 2005 ) .",
    "they may explain rather strong h@xmath23 from ngc 6553 and ngc 6528 compared to those h@xmath23-weak mwgcs with @xmath91.0 @xmath24 [ fe / h ] @xmath24 @xmath90.6 .",
    "the overall agreement between the @xmath0-enhanced ssp models of h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 lick indices and the mwgcs in figure 15 are much better than what we found for h@xmath23 , as shown in figure 14 . however , it is the case that the @xmath0-enhanced models differ less from the scaled - solar models for h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 than they did for h@xmath23 .",
    "ngc 6544 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath91.38 ; red open square ) is still an outlier but not to the great extent that it is for h@xmath23 . as with h@xmath23 , ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 , with sizable population of blue hb stars ,",
    "show relatively stronger h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 within a small metallicity range ( again , these two and 47 tuc are marked with different colored circles for comparison ) , particularly at h@xmath2 .",
    "the top and middle panels of figures 5 @xmath9 8 illuminated that the isochrone and spectral effects of @xmath0-element enhancement on h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 go in the opposite direction and their effects are cancelled out on the metal - poor side , exposing mostly the hb effect alone . among four h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 indices ,",
    "h@xmath26 has the broadest dynamic range ( @xmath108    difference between ngc 7078 with [ fe / h ] = @xmath92.45 and ngc 6528 with [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.10 ) . the bottom panels of figure 15 display that h@xmath27 and h@xmath29 are very similar to h@xmath26 and h@xmath28 in the upper panels , except for a narrower dynamic range .      in figure 16 , we see that the overall match between lick iron indices and the mwgcs is generally good although not superb in fe5270 particularly around [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath91.0 .",
    "one of the culprits , is perhaps , the spectral effect of ca as we described in section 3.3 .",
    "isochrone effects from individual element need to be investigated because @xmath0-enhanced isochrone effects become significant near [ fe / h ] = @xmath91.0 .",
    "dotter et al .",
    "( 2007a ) investigated individual elemental effects on the isochrones only at the solar metalicity .",
    "the dynamic range of fe5406 , which is claimed to be the least sensitive to every element except iron among lick iron indices ( lee et al .",
    "2009 ; percival et al . 2009 ) , is only slightly smaller ( @xmath101.6  ) compared to that of fe5270 ( @xmath102.4  ) and fe5335 ( @xmath102.0  ) .    despite the use of high - resolution spectra of individual stars , the discrepancy of [ fe / h ]",
    "estimation can be quite large among different studies even though their internal uncertainties are often fairly small .",
    "for example , barbuy et al . ( 1999 ) found ngc 6553 to have [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.55 while carretta et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found [ fe / h]=@xmath90.06 . to demonstrate the effect of changing the [ fe / h ] scale we present figure 17 , which is the same as figure 16 , but the [ fe / h ] values of mwgcs are from harris ( 1996 ) compilation instead of table 1 of s05 .",
    "compared to figure 16 , the matches are not very favorable especially at @xmath91.0 @xmath24 [ fe / h ] @xmath24 @xmath90.5 .    in figure 18 , we compare [ fe / h ] values in table 1 of s05 with several different [ fe / h ] compilations available in the literature .",
    "they are harris ( 1996 ; 2003 version ) , zinn & west ( 1984 ) , carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) , and kraft & ivans ( 2003 ) .",

    "29 mwgcs are shown here . by comparing these two",
    ", we notice that the harris 2003 compilation generally follows the zw84 [ fe / h ] .",

    "it seems that there are about 0.18 dex estimation of ngc 6388 by carretta et al .",

    "furthermore , we have investigated the effect of imf variation on the lick indices .",
    "it is realized that , among the @xmath0 elements , mg significantly influences the spectral effects on balmer and iron line indices . from the comparison of our models of mg @xmath1 and ca4227 with the schiavon et al .",

    "moreover , we note that our ssp model lick iron indices comply with the kraft & ivans ( 2003 ) [ fe / h ] based upon marcs models .",
    "balmer lines , particularly h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 , of mwgcs are also well reproduced by our @xmath0-enhanced models not only because of the combination of isochrone and spectral effects but also because of our reasonable hb treatment .",

    "<S> we present simple stellar population ( ssp ) models with scaled - solar and @xmath0-element enhanced abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the ssp models are based on the dartmouth stellar evolution database , our library of synthetic stellar spectra , and a detailed systematic variation of horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphology with age and metallicity . in order to test the relative importance of a variety of ssp model ingredients , we compare our ssp models with integrated spectra of 41 milky way globular clusters ( mwgcs ) from schiavon et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2005 ) . using the mg @xmath1 and ca4227 indices </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that mg and ca are enhanced by about + 0.4 and + 0.2 dex , respectively , in agreement with results from high resolution spectra of individual stars in mwgcs . </S>",
    "<S> balmer lines , particularly h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 , of mwgcs are reproduced by our @xmath0-enhanced ssp models not only because of the combination of isochrone and spectral effects but also because of our reasonable hb treatment . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is shown that the mg abundance significantly influences balmer and iron line indices . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the investigation of power - law initial mass function ( imf ) variations suggests that an imf much shallower than salpeter is unrealistic because the balmer lines are too strong on the metal - poor side to be compatible with observations . </S>"
