    "during the past four decades , starting from the pioneering works on calculations of one - electron self - energy @xcite and vacuum polarization @xcite corrections , considerable progress has been achieved in the theoretical understanding of the calculations of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) corrections to all orders in @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath3 is the nuclear charge number . to date , state - of - the - art qed calculations include all corrections up to the second order in @xmath1 , for review see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "high - precision experiments to measure the binding and transition energies in highly charged ions @xcite are sensitive to the second - order qed corrections .",
    "they confirm theoretical predictions to a high accuracy , and thereby provide a unique opportunity for tests of qed in the strong coulomb field .    among rigorous qed calculations of the energy levels of highly charged ions , see @xcite and references",
    "therein , a particular place is occupied with the works where the ionization energies are investigated .",
    "the ionization energies allow one to relate masses of ions with different number of electrons , and hence are of great interest for the tasks of mass spectrometry @xcite .",
    "up to date , the high - precision _ ab initio _ qed calculations of the ionization energies have been performed for hydrogen @xcite , helium @xcite , and lithium @xcite isoelectronic sequences .",
    "there are many nonrelativistic and relativistic calculations of the ground - state energies of berylliumlike ions in the literature @xcite .",
    "some of these works somehow include the radiative and nuclear recoil corrections . as a rule , only the first - order qed effects are included , the many - electron qed effects are treated with the use of one - electron approximations or semiempirical methods .",
    "the necessity of a more rigorous qed treatment to improve the theoretical accuracy has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have calculated the ground - state binding energies for the even-@xmath3 berylliumlike ions in the range @xmath4 .",
    "we have also evaluated the ionization energies for these ions by subtracting the binding energies of corresponding li - like ions taken from the literature .",
    "the main goal of the present investigation is to calculate the ground - state ionization potentials for these ions directly and self - consistently including the qed corrections up to the second order in @xmath1 and the electron - correlation effects to all orders in @xmath5 .",
    "we also extend these calculations to all other ions along the beryllium isoelectronic sequence with nuclear charge @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the procedure of calculation of the ionization energies is described in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] . in sec .",

    "section [ sec:3 ] is reserved for a brief summary .",
    "the relativistic units ( @xmath6 ) and the heaviside charge unit ( @xmath7 ) are used throughout the paper .",
    "the furry picture is the standard starting point for investigation of the properties of heavy few - electron ions within qed . in this picture interaction of electrons with the coulomb field of the nucleus @xmath8",
    "is taken into account to all orders in @xmath2 from the very beginning : @xmath9 \\psi_n ( \\bm{r } ) = \\varepsilon_n \\psi_n ( \\bm{r } ) .",

    "is the two - time green function ( ttgf ) method @xcite .",
    "naturally , such an approach works well when the interelectronic interaction is small in comparison with the binding energies of all electrons of the system . otherwise , the convergence of the perturbation series is often slow .",
    "it is possible to accelerate the convergence of the perturbation theory by transition to the extended furry picture .",
    "this implies the replacement of the nuclear potential in eq .",
    "( [ direq ] ) with an effective potential : @xmath10 the local screening potential @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ effpot ] ) models the screening of the nuclear potential by the other electrons partly accounting for the interelectronic interaction in the zeroth - order hamiltonian .",
    "the interaction with the potential @xmath12 is to be accounted for perturbatively to avoid the double counting of the screening effects .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of the @xmath13 state energy starting from the pure coulomb field as the zeroth order approximation is difficult , because of the quasidegeneracy with the @xmath14 state . the application of some screening potentials can remove this degeneracy and simplify calculations significantly .",
    "the extended furry picture was successfully employed in qed calculations of the energy levels @xcite , the hyperfine splitting @xcite , and the @xmath15-factor @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply four different types of the screening potential .",
    "all these potentials are spherically symmetric by construction .",
    "our first and simplest choice is the core - hartree ( ch ) potential induced by the @xmath16 closed shell .",
    "it can be obtained from the radial charge density of two @xmath17 electrons : @xmath18 , \\qquad   \\int_0^\\infty \\rho_{\\rm ch}(r ) dr = 2 ,     \\label{chdens } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are large and small radial components of the dirac wave function .",
    "three other types of the screening potential were constructed for both three - electron ( @xmath21 ) and four - electron ( @xmath22 ) configurations , so that the total number of the screening potentials employed is equal to seven . in what follows we label these potentials with the indices 3 and 4 , depending on the electronic configuration used .",
    "the first type of the screening potential generated for both configurations is the local dirac - fock ( ldf ) potential @xcite .",
    "this potential is constructed by inversion of the radial dirac equation with the radial wave functions obtained in the dirac - fock approximation .",
    "two other screening potentials arise from the density - functional theory . in terms of the total radial charge density @xmath23 of all electrons in the configuration",
    "the kohn - sham ( ks ) potential reads as follows : @xmath24 , \\qquad \\int_0^\\infty \\rho_{t}(r ) dr = n ,     \\label{ksdens } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 or 4 depending on the electron configuration .",
    "we introduce the latter correction @xcite to improve the asymptotic behavior of the ks potentials at large @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the last type of the screening potential generated for @xmath21 and @xmath22 configurations is the perdew - zunger ( pz ) potential @xcite . summarizing the description of the screening potentials used in the present work it is worth noting that they have different asymptotic behavior .",
    "the potentials @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 behave like @xmath31 at large distances @xmath32 ,",
    "whereas the potentials @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 behave like @xmath36 . in other words , if we set @xmath37 for the ldf , ks and pz potentials , and @xmath38 for the ch potential , then all screening potentials behave like @xmath39 . in this case",
    "@xmath40 has the meaning of the total charge of the screening cloud .",
    "the calculation of the ionization potentials of berylliumlike ions in the present work follows in general the scheme which was used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the evaluation of the binding energies",
    ". nevertheless , there are some modifications in the calculation procedure .",
    "below , we briefly discuss the main stages of the calculations .",
    "the evaluation of the ionization potentials can be conveniently divided into several steps . at first stage",
    "it is necessary to solve eq .",
    "( [ direq ] ) for the state under consideration with an effective potential ( [ effpot ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the bound - state qed calculations one needs to have a quasicomplete basis set of the dirac equation solutions for representation of the dirac - coulomb green function @xmath41 the set of one - electron wave functions was evaluated employing the dual kinetic balance ( dkb ) method @xcite with the basis functions constructed from the b - splines @xcite .",
    "the application of the screening potentials allows one to partly take into account the interaction between electrons .",
    "we have to consider the remaining interelectronic interaction by perturbation theory . in fig .",
    "[ fig : int ] the corresponding set of first- and second - order feynman diagrams is depicted .",
    "the double line represents the electron propagator in the effective potential .",
    "the circle with a cross corresponds to the screening potential counterterm .",
    "the ionization energy of the @xmath42 electron can be obtained by subtracting the binding energy of the li - like ion from the binding energy of the be - like ion .",
    "diagrams containing only the interaction between the @xmath17 electrons contribute to both binding energies and cancel each other in the difference .",
    "for this reason , here and further throughout the paper we deal only with those diagrams , where one or two of the incoming ( outgoing ) electron lines correspond to the @xmath42 electrons .",
    "the calculation formulas for the diagrams ( a)-(d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : int ] can be found , e.g. , in refs .  @xcite . as it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , only a minor modification of the standard procedures is necessary to perform the calculation of the @xmath43 interaction .",
    "the formulas for the corrections corresponding to the diagrams ( e)-(g ) can be easily obtained with the use of the ttgf method : @xmath44    \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left ( v_{aa } - v_{bb } \\right ) i'_{baab}(\\varepsilon_b - \\varepsilon_a)\\bigg\\ } ,    \\label{contr_g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the photon propagator , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "next , we have to take into account the interelectronic - interaction corrections of the third and higher orders .",
    "we have evaluated these contributions within the breit approximation . at first",
    ", we have calculated the binding energies of the @xmath54 and @xmath22 states solving the dirac - coulomb - breit equation by means of the configuration - interaction dirac - fock - sturm method ( ci - dfs ) @xcite .",
    "then , the contributions of third and higher orders to these binding energies , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , were extracted from the total ci - dfs energies using the numerical procedure described , e.g. , in refs .",
    "finally , we took the difference @xmath57 to obtain the desired contribution @xmath58 to the ionization potential of the @xmath42 electron . to estimate the accuracy of our numerical procedure we have compared the first- and second - order interelectronic - interaction contributions to the ionization potential , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , calculated within ci - dfs method with analogous quantities evaluated with the use of our code for the qed calculations .",
    "for this reason the diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d)-(g ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : int ] have been evaluated in the coulomb gauge neglecting the contribution of the negative - energy continuum and energy dependence of the interelectronic - interaction operator .",
    "we have found a very good agreement between those two independent approaches for all types of the screening potentials .     the interelectronic - interaction diagrams .",
    "the double line denotes the electron propagator in the effective potential ( [ effpot ] ) .",
    "the wavy line corresponds to the photon propagator .",
    "the symbol @xmath61 represents the local screening potential counterterm.,width=453 ]    next , one should consider the contribution of the radiative corrections .",
    "figure [ fig : se ] displays all relevant first- and second - order qed diagrams with the exception of one - electron two - loop graphs , which we will discuss below .",
    "the diagrams from the first line are known as the self - energy ( se ) diagrams , while the diagrams in the second line are referred to as the vacuum polarization ( vp ) diagrams .",
    "the formal expressions for these contributions can be easily obtained within the ttgf method , they are presented , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the formal expressions suffer from ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the way for cancellation of the divergences in the se diagrams is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the present work we follow the renormalization scheme described there .",
    "the vp contributions are conveniently divided into the uehling and wichmann - kroll parts . the renormalized expression for the uehling potential",
    "is well known : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the nuclear charge density , normalized to unity . to account for the screening effect on the uehling potential in the diagrams ( f ) ,",
    "( i)-(j ) , one should replace @xmath64 by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the charge density of the electron screening cloud , normalized to unity .",
    "in order to calculate the contribution of the counterterm diagram ( h ) one has to replace @xmath64 by @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ uepot ] ) .",
    "the renormalized uehling operator which corresponds to the diagram ( g ) has the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the energy of the transmitted photon .",
    "the wichmann - kroll contribution was calculated for the diagrams ( f ) , ( i ) and ( j ) using the expression : @xmath70 \\ } , \\label{wkpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the radial components of the partial contributions to the free- and bound - electron green function .",
    "it turns out that calculation of eq .",
    "( [ wkpot ] ) using the spectral decomposition ( [ greenf ] ) with the b - spline finite basis set is rather problematic .",
    "therefore , we have evaluated the radial green functions for all screening potentials numerically , solving a corresponding system of differential equations .",
    "the wichmann - kroll contribution to the diagram ( g ) is relatively small @xcite and has been neglected , together with the related contribution to the diagram ( h ) .",

    "the notations are the same as in fig . [",
