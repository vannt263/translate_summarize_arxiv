    "this work is based on our previous paper  @xcite where we set the general dynamical - system formalism for accretion of perfect fluids onto static spherically symmetric black holes .",
    "we keep using the same notation for the thermodynamic functions of the fluid and the hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "so , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the baryon number density , specific enthalpy ( enthalpy per particle ) , energy density , specific entropy , pressure , temperature , and four - velocity vector , respectively . in a locally inertial frame ,",
    "the three - dimensional speed of sound @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 .",
    "when the entropy @xmath4 is constant , which is the case for accretion of perfect fluids onto static spherically symmetric black holes , this reduces to @xmath10 .",
    "the aim of this short work is two - fold : ( 1 ) generalize the dynamical - system formalism for accretion of perfect fluids to metrics of the form @xmath11 this will allow us to generalize the properties of the accreting fluid intended for future use .",
    "( 2 ) obtain new interesting solutions not discussed so far in the scientistic literature .    in  , ( @xmath12 )",
    "are any functions of the radial coordinate @xmath13 assumed to be well - defined and positive - definite in the regions where the killing vector @xmath14 is timelike and their ratio @xmath15 is positive - definite on the horizons too .",
    "for the metric   to describe a black hole solution , the equations @xmath16 and @xmath17 should have the same set of solutions with same multiplicities . in our applications",
    "we restrict ourselves to the cases where the global structure of the spacetime is well - determined by ( @xmath12 ) . to keep the analysis general",
    ", we do not assume asymptotic flatness of the metric as we intend to apply it to the de sitter and anti - de sitter - like black holes .",
    "this metric form generalizes the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite ; in ref .  @xcite we restricted ourselves to the case @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to show that equations  ( 5 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 24 ) , ( 25 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite generalize respectively to @xmath20 where ( @xmath21 ) are constants of motion , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the three - velocity of a fluid element as measured by a locally static observer .",
    "the second line in   expresses the law of particle conservation , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the constant of motion @xmath26 [ @xmath14 is a timelike killing vector ] .",
    "this constant is the inertial - equivalent generalization of the energy conservation equation @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath28 in   can be written as @xmath29 where  0 \" denotes any reference point ( @xmath30 ) from the phase portrait ; this could be a cp , if there is any , spatial infinity ( @xmath31 ) , or any other reference point .",
    "we can thus write @xmath32 the equation of state ( eos ) of the fluid may be given in the form @xmath33 or equivalently in the form @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that ( @xmath35 ) , the specific enthalpy , and the three - dimensional speed of sound satisfy @xmath36 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath1 .    equations   and   imply that the specific enthalpy @xmath2 depends explicitly on ( @xmath37 ) only .",
    "there is no explicit dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "as we shall see in the next subsection , this implies that the hamiltonian @xmath0 , which defines the dynamical system , will also depend explicitly on ( @xmath37 ) only .",
    "this fact will have consequences on the location of the critical points ( cp s ) .",
    "if the fluid had further properties , say , being isothermal or polytropic , @xmath2 and @xmath0 can be expressed explicitly in terms of ( @xmath39 ) , as this is done in the following section .",
    "horizons @xmath40 are defined by @xmath41 and @xmath42 or simply by @xmath42 since the equations @xmath41 and @xmath42 are assumed to have the same set of solutions with same multiplicities .",
    "the zeros of @xmath42 determine the regions in three - space where the fluid flow takes place : these are the regions where @xmath14 is timelike .    note that the case @xmath43 , corresponding either to @xmath44   ( no fluid ) or to @xmath45   and any @xmath1 ( no flow ) , is not interesting .",
    "so , we assume @xmath46 . as the fluid approaches , or emanates from , any horizon ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 approaches 0 .",
    "three cases emerge from  :    1 .",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath1 may converge or diverge there ( @xmath47 ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath1 diverges there .",
    "the fluid cumulates near the horizon resulting in a divergent pressure which repulses the fluid backwards  @xcite ; 3 .",
    "@xmath51 assumes any value between 0 and 1 there .",
    "this yields a divergent @xmath1 as @xmath47 . since @xmath52 there is no reason that the fluid cumulates near the horizon : the flow continues until all fluid particles have crossed the horizon .",
    "we rule out this case for it is not physical .",
    "this conclusion , due to the law of particle conservation , is general and it does not depend on the fluid characteristics .    since a non - perfect simple fluid ( containing a single particle species ) also obeys the law of particle conservation  , these conclusions remain valid for real fluids too .",
    "if the fluid had a uniform pressure , that is , if the fluid were not subject to acceleration , the specific enthalpy @xmath2 reduces to the particle mass @xmath53 and the first equation in   reduces to @xmath54 along the fluidlines .",
    "this is the well know energy conservation law which stems from the fact that the fluid flow is in this case geodesic . now ,",
    "if the pressure throughout the fluid is not uniform , acceleration develops through the fluid and the fluid flow becomes non - geodesic ; the energy conservation equation @xmath55 , which is no longer valid , generalizes to its relativistic equivalent  @xcite @xmath56 as expressed in the first equation in  .",
    "let the hamiltonian @xmath0 of the dynamical system be proportional to @xmath57  , which is a constant of motion .",
    "substituting the first equation in   into the first equation in   yields @xmath58    with @xmath0 given by  , the dynamical system reads @xmath59 ( here the dot denotes the @xmath60 derivative where @xmath60 is the time variable of the hamiltonian dynamical system ) . in   it",
    "is understood that @xmath13 is kept constant when performing the partial differentiation with respect to @xmath61 in @xmath62 and that @xmath61 is kept constant when performing the partial differentiation with respect to @xmath13 in @xmath63 .",
    "the critical points ( cps ) of the dynamical system are the points ( @xmath64 ) where the rhs s in   are zero .",

    "the first equation states that at a cp the three - velocity of the fluid equals the speed of sound .",
    "the second equation determines @xmath80 once the eos , @xmath33 or @xmath34  , is known .    from the set of equations   we see that the metric function @xmath38 does not enter explicitly in the determination of the cp s ; however , it does that implicitly via the successive dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 , of @xmath1 on @xmath61 , and of @xmath61 on @xmath81 .    other sets of cps , solutions to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , may exist too .",
