    "the spin @xmath0 kondo model describes a localized magnetic moment interacting with an electron gas , via an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling.@xcite despite a long history , and even an exact solution , it has not yet surrendered all its secrets .",
    "it is well established that the ground state is a spin singlet in which the impurity spin is quenched by the electron gas , and the spatial region where the electron gas is correlated with the impurity is referred to as the kondo screening cloud.@xcite even for an isotropic system , its precise spatial profile is not known analytically , except asymptotically,@xcite and it is only in the past few years that it has been calculated numerically.@xcite despite wide - ranging proposals,@xcite it has eluded direct measurement , partly because of the difficulty in measuring spin correlations .    in the isotropic case ,",
    "the screening cloud is characterized by the ground state correlation function @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the impurity spin operator , and @xmath3 is the electron spin density at @xmath4 .",
    "when the kondo temperature is much lower than the fermi energy , the screening cloud can be decomposed into a forward scattering contribution @xmath5 and a backscattering contribution @xmath6 , so that @xmath7 , where the two functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 vary slowly on the scale of the fermi wavelength @xmath8 . in the scaling regime and for spin - isotropic kondo exchange ,",
    "the profile of the screening cloud displays a universal line shape,@xcite which is dependent on the value of kondo coupling @xmath9 only through an emergent length @xmath10 that is inversely proportional to the kondo temperature.@xcite to be specific , if @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , are correlation functions corresponding to different values @xmath9 and @xmath14 of the kondo coupling , and @xmath10 and @xmath15 are the corresponding kondo lengths , then @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .    recently , we have realized that it may be possible to measure the longitudinal forward scattering ( @xmath18 ) component of the screening cloud ( a precise definition is given below ) in a chain of tunnel - coupled superconducting islands.@xcite it turns out that the hamiltonian describing the charge and phase degrees of freedom in this system is equivalent to the _ spin - anisotropic _ kondo model in one dimension,@xcite described by two coupling constants : the @xmath19-components of the impurity and electron spins couple with a strength @xmath20 , while the components perpendicular to the @xmath19-axis couple with a different strength @xmath21 .",
    "a detailed study of the screening cloud in the anisotropic kondo model has to our knowledge not been performed before , and is therefore timely .    in the anisotropic case ,",
    "there are four correlation functions of interest , namely @xmath22 , that measures the correlation between @xmath19-components of the impurity and electron spins ( both in the forward @xmath23 and backward @xmath24 scattering channels ) , and @xmath25 , that measures correlations between components perpendicular to the @xmath19 axis ( in each channel ) .",
    "clearly , an anisotropic kondo interaction , characterized by two coupling constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 , will affect the universal scaling picture non - trivially .",
    "the universal scaling of the isotropic model has been confirmed using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , a popular method to study the kondo model.@xcite however , there is still room to improve the accuracy of existing results .",
    "for instance , it is predicted analytically  @xcite that backscattering dominates forward scattering inside the screening cloud .",
    "this produces oscillations from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic correlations between the impurity and the electron gas , on the scale of half the fermi wavelength .",
    "the first numerical calculation of the universal scaling functions were reported in ref .  .",
    "however , the predominance of the backscattering component over the forward scattering component inside the cloud was not resolved .",
    "this was probably due to the fact that results were obtained at relatively large kondo temperatures , so that there was not a sufficient separation of scales between the size @xmath10 of the cloud , and the short distance ultraviolet cut - off scale . in a more recent work,@xcite the nrg method of ref .",
    "was refined , and the alternation of ferro- and antiferromagnetic correlations inside the cloud clearly be seen .",
    "however , results were only presented for distances up to @xmath26 fermi wavelengths from the impurity . at these scales ,",
    "the correlation functions show non - universal modulations .    in this article , we perform numerical calculations that are sufficiently accurate to investigate the universal scaling behavior in regimes ranging from isotropic to strongly anisotropic kondo couplings . at the same time",
    ", we can clearly resolve the predominace of the backscattering component over the forward scattering component inside the cloud .",
    "in precise terms , we investigate the the following questions : let @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath13 , be correlation functions at distinct values @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "under which conditions are there constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that @xmath34 , for all @xmath17 , and what are the line shapes of these universal scaling curves ?",
    "our general numerical findings show that scaling is typically obeyed for fixed values of @xmath20 . in other words , correlators at the same @xmath20 but different @xmath21 can be scaled onto each other .",
    "this statement holds as long as @xmath35 ( in dimensionless units of the inverse density of states ) , while for transverse couplings of order one , the kondo temperature becomes comparable to the fermi energy , and universality is lost . for @xmath36 , we find that the line shapes of the cloud correlation functions acquire a @xmath20-dependence that can not be scaled away . however , as @xmath20 approaches @xmath21 , the @xmath20 dependence rapidly becomes very weak .",
    "one thus find a sizable region of parameter space , located around the strict spin - isotropic line @xmath37 , in which the universal curves have little discernible @xmath20 dependence . in this region , correlators calculated at @xmath38 _ and _ @xmath39 can to a very good approximation",
    "be scaled onto the unique universal curve of the isotropic model .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with poor man s scaling arguments  @xcite at small @xmath21 , as we will explain in detail .",
    "our work also elaborates on a different but related topic , that was raised very recently by lukyanov _",
    "_ in ref . , where the overlap between two kondo wave functions with different kondo couplings was computed analytically using integrability techniques , and numerically with the density matrix renormalization group .",
    "we complement these interesting results , by providing a simpler ( approximate ) analytical expression for the kondo overlaps in the spin - anisotropic limit .",
    "we also show that our numerical method reproduces the full analytical result , as it should .",
    "regarding methodology , our approach combines both analytics and numerically exact calculations . in the case of strong spin - anisotropy , @xmath40",
    ", we provide asymptotically exact formulas , that were not discussed in previous literature , for the fermionic kondo cloud . for a general choice of parameters",
    ", we employ a recent approach using a coherent state expansion of the wave function , @xcite that has not yet been applied to the computation of purely fermionic observables that pertain to the kondo model .",
    "this method relies on a variational ansatz , formulated in the language of the spin - boson model , which describes a two - level system coupled to a multi - mode ohmic bosonic bath.@xcite this spin - boson model is known to be equivalent to the anisotropic kondo model,@xcite with bosonization providing an exact mapping between the two.@xcite we exploit this mapping to apply the coherent - state expansion to the kondo model .",
    "in addition , the flexible structure of the ansatz allows one to add progressively more contributions to it , so that the method converges rapidly to the exact ground state with arbitrary accuracy .    historically , the systematic coherent state expansion proposed by bera _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite builds on seminal works of emery and luther,@xcite and of silbey and harris,@xcite in the language of the spin - boson model , and on independent works by anderson,@xcite and bergmann and zhang@xcite in the language of the kondo model .",
    "the approach of emery and luther , silbey and harris , and anderson corresponds to the lowest order approximation , involving a single coherent state , and provides _ quantitatively _ accurate results only in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "bergmann and zhang took a step in the direction of a two coherent - state ansatz by adding an extra term to the lowest order approximation , but constrained its form sub - optimally compared to the full solution with two coherent states .",
    "we stress that this type of approach differs from the well - known method pioneered by yosida,@xcite that takes as starting point a state in which a single electron binds into a singlet with the impurity , while the rest of the fermi sea is unaffected .",
    "the wave function of the bound electron is chosen to maximize the binding energy .",
    "the relationship between the yosida approximation and the single - coherent state ansatz is reminiscent of the relationship in superconductivity between the single cooper pair on top of a fermi sea on the one hand , and the full bcs wave function on the other .",
    "yosida s approach gives qualitatively correct results , but even when the effect of additional particle - hole excitations are included,@xcite it can not yield arbitrarily accurate results for the correlations inside the kondo screening cloud .    in this article",
    ", we also contribute an important innovation to the coherent - state expansion methodology . in previous implementations ,",
    "the bosonic bath was limited to a finite number of modes , because the number of variational parameters in the ansatz scaled linearly with the number of bath modes . here",
    ", we first partially solve the variational problem analytically , so that the number of remaining variational parameters that have to be determined numerically is independent of the number of bath oscillators .",
    "this allows us to take the thermodynamic limit before we optimize the energy numerically , and probe arbitrarily large distances . in the kondo language",
    ", this means that we work directly with an infinite conductor .    with nrg ,",
    "probing large length scales comes at the cost of losing information about shorter lengths scales . in order to maintain good spatial resolution ,",
    "one has to introduce a fictitious impurity at the position where correlators are evaluated .",
    "each position considered then requires the solution of a given two - channel kondo impurity problem , so that a high - resolution computation of the kondo cloud with nrg is quite expensive numerically .",
    "our method remarkably deals with all length scales on an equal footing , so that the kondo cloud can be calculated in a single step , once the many - body ground state is known .",
    "the coherent state expansion thus nicely complements the existing tools for studying the kondo model .",

    "in this section we write down the two related models that we study , and make explicit the deep connection between them .",
    "the first hamiltonian is the anisotropic spin-@xmath0 kondo model in one dimension , that describes a spin-1/2 impurity coupled to a fermi sea .",
    "the fermi sea does not necessarily represent electrons confined to one dimension .",
    "if the electron gas is higher dimensional , but the impurity is a point - like scatterer , it only interacts with electronic @xmath42-waves .",
    "such @xmath42-waves in the electron gas can then be described by a one - dimensional kondo hamiltonian , where the spatial coordinate is the radial distance from the impurity .",
    "the second hamiltonian is the ohmic spin - boson model , that appears in many area of physics , from superconducting nano - circuits to biological systems . below an ultraviolet energy scale set by the fermi energy ,",
    "the two models are equivalent.@xcite the full mapping is reviewed in appendix [ appmap ] .",

    "we denote these operators with tildes , because we will denote the useful slow modes ( defined below ) without tildes .",
    "we assume @xmath50 , so that there are both left and right - movers at the fermi energy .",

    "we have defined slow modes @xmath56 and a similar relation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 is the ultraviolet cut - off energy .",
    "operators without over - bars are associated with even - parity single particle wave functions , so that @xmath60 creates an electron in the state @xmath61 $ ] . in @xmath62 dimensions ,",
    "an equivalent role is played by @xmath42-waves . for negative @xmath4",

    "because @xmath63 and @xmath65 create electrons localized to the same physical regions in space , we refer to ( [ h2 ] ) as the unfolded representation .",
    "operators with over - bars are associated with odd - parity single particle wave functions , so that @xmath66 creates an electron in the state @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "since the even and odd modes decouple , and only the even modes couple to the impurity , we focus on electrons in even orbitals and drop the @xmath68 terms in @xmath69 .    in the process of linearizing the spectrum ( integrating out fast modes ) , the bare couplings @xmath52 and @xmath53 are renormalized to new values @xmath20 and @xmath21 , that depend on the ultraviolet scale @xmath59 .",
    "note however that su(2 ) symmetry , if present , is preserved under renormalization .",
    "thus , if @xmath70 ( isotropic limit ) , then @xmath71 .    in this work",
    ", we will make extensive use of the well - known fact , reviewed in appendix [ appmap ] , that the kondo hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) can be mapped onto an ohmic spin - boson model : @xmath72 here @xmath73 are bosonic operators such that @xmath74=0 $ ] and @xmath75=\\delta_{q , q'}$ ] , while @xmath76 and @xmath77 are pauli matrices .",
    "these pseudo - spin operators are not the physical angular momentum operators of the kondo impurity , but are related to them .",
    "the parameters of the spin - boson model are related to those of the kondo model by @xmath78",
    "having defined the system we investigate , we now write down the observables that we will study .",
    "we are interested here in ground state correlation functions between the impurity spin and the electron spin density at a distance @xmath4 from the impurity , which we refer to collectively as the kondo screening cloud ( or cloud for short).@xcite we give equivalent expressions for the cloud correlators as ground state expectation values in both the fermionic and the bosonic pictures . in appendix [ appcloud ]",
    "the bosonic expressions are derived starting from the fermionic expressions .    in the fermionic picture , the cloud correlation functions is defined as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the @xmath81 component of the impurity spin operator , and @xmath82_{\\sigma\\sigma ' } \\tilde \\psi_{\\sigma'}(x)\\ ] ] is the @xmath83 component of the electron spin density at @xmath4 .",

    "the former is the result of scattering events that change the electron momentum by an amount that is small compared to @xmath89 , while the latter results from scattering between the fermi points at @xmath90 .",

    "the regime of physical significance is @xmath92 where the behavior of the cloud is insensitive to ultraviolet details of the model .",
    "none the less , we delay taking the @xmath98 limit until the end of the calculation , reasoning that it is of some interest to see how a particular cut - off scheme regularizes ultraviolet singularities .",
    "we presented expressions for a one - dimensional cloud .",
    "however , the generalization to a higher dimensional electron gas is trivial , assuming a point impurity that therefore only scatters @xmath42-waves.@xcite in this case , one interprets the coordinate @xmath4 as a radial distance and divides the one - dimensional correlator by the area of a spherical shell of radius @xmath4 .",
    "one also reverses the sign of the @xmath87 components , because the radial part of the higher dimensional problem is defined on the half - line , with a @xmath99 phase shift between left- and right movers .    to make further progress in the computation of the cloud observables",
    ", we need an accurate approximation for the ground state of the spin - boson model .",
    "that is the topic of the next section .",
    "we will use here a systematic coherent - state decomposition  @xcite of the many - body ground state of the ohmic spin - boson model . physically , coherent states appear as natural degrees of freedom , because , in the absence of spin - tunneling @xmath100 , the two spin configurations are associated with a displacement of the bath modes from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",

    "the single coherent - state ansatz ( usually dubbed the silbey - harris state ) includes the effect of tunneling by promoting @xmath108 to a variational parameter and taking as trial state the linear combination @xmath109 .",
    "this results readily in the simple expression @xmath110 with the self - consistency condition @xmath111 .",
    "this trial wavefunction provides an excellent approximation to the true ground state provided the shifted equilibrium positions @xmath112 of most oscillators are not too far apart , _",

    "the overlap @xmath114 , with @xmath108 determined variationally , becomes exponentially small , and this strongly underestimates the tunneling energy @xmath115 .",
    "the coherent - state expansion addresses this issue by extending the silbey - harris form to a more general linear superposition of coherent states : @xmath116 with the set of displacement @xmath117 parametrizing a family of silbey - harris states : @xmath118 \\left|0\\right>. \\label{family}\\ ] ] here @xmath119 is the maximal number of allowed coherent states in the decomposition  ( [ superpose ] ) , and sets the level of approximation . the displacements @xmath120 and coefficients @xmath121",
    "are determined by minimizing @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a lagrange multiplier that is used to enforce normalization .",
    "these parameters are generically found to be real in the ground state .",
    "the coherent - state expansion already dramatically improves the estimate for the tunneling energy @xmath124 for @xmath125 , by allowing for cross - terms @xmath126 , in which the displacements @xmath117 and @xmath127 are anti - correlated at low @xmath128 .",
    "such cross - terms are therefore not exponentially small in @xmath113 , and allow a sizable energy gain compared to the silbey - harris approximation .",
    "it is important to note that an arbitrary state of the spin - boson hamiltonian can be written as an infinite but _ discrete _ sum of the form ( [ superpose ] ) , at least if the bosonic bath contains a finite number of modes .",
    "this follows from a theorem , proved by cahill,@xcite that for a single bosonic mode , countable sets @xmath129 of ( real ) coherent states exist , that form a complete basis . for a finite number of bosonic modes , a general state can therefore be approximated to any required accuracy , by making @xmath119 sufficiently large .",
    "it is in this sense that the coherent state expansion is numerically exact , provided in practice that good convergence to the true many - body ground state occurs .",
    "previous investigations  @xcite , as well as the extensive comparisons made in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] , demonstrate indeed that the expansion  ( [ superpose ] ) rapidly approaches the exact ground state of the spin - boson model as @xmath119 is increased to moderate values , also for an infinite bath .",
    "in previous implementations of the coherent expansion  ( [ superpose]-[family ] ) , the bosonic bath was restricted to a large but finite number @xmath130 of modes , and each of the @xmath131 displacements @xmath117 was treated as an independent variational parameter . in this work ,",
    "we want to calculate the kondo screening cloud , which requires a high spatial resolution from short to possibly exponentially large distances , so that a huge number of bath modes needs to be included .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have an implementation of the method in which the number of variational parameters does not depend on the number of included modes .",
    "such an implementation would also allow for computations for a continuous spectral density ( thermodynamic limit ) , which numerical techniques like nrg are not able to perform . in this section ,",

    "furthermore , it turns out that @xmath415 is no longer @xmath113-independent beyond @xmath416 ( as shown by our numerical simulations below ) .    the two pertinent facts to emerge from this discussion are the following .",
    "firstly , whereas the magnitudes of the longitudinal and transverse components of the cloud have to be rescaled by different inverse lengths @xmath325 and @xmath417 , the coordinate @xmath4 is always rescaled by @xmath239 . in other words ,",
    "the longitudinal and transverse clouds have different characteristic magnitudes @xmath325 and @xmath417 , but the same characteristic size @xmath239 .",
    "secondly , the universal scaling curves depend in general on @xmath113 .",
    "thus , as expected from poor man s scaling , clouds at the same @xmath20 but different @xmath21 have the same shape , whereas clouds at different @xmath20 in general have different shapes .    the differences in scaling behavior between the small @xmath113 and isotropic clouds are thrown into sharp relief when one considers the small @xmath4 asymptotic form of the cloud correlators . at @xmath418 , the small @xmath113 results ( [ uncomps1 ] ) and ( [ uncomps2 ] ) lead to asymptotic behavior : @xmath419 the @xmath420 component diverges much more slowly in the @xmath421 limit than is the case at isotropic couplings ( @xmath422 vs. @xmath423 ) , whereas the @xmath424 component diverges more rapidly than in the isotropic case ( @xmath425 vs. @xmath426 ) .",
    "thus , the alternation between ferro- and antiferromagnetic correlations close to the impurity is enhanced in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this is not surprising , as small @xmath113 implies @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore we see that the small @xmath4 asymptotic behavior of the transverse cloud is explicitly @xmath113-dependent , displaying power - law behavior with an exponent @xmath427 , implying a divergence as @xmath428 that is closer to @xmath235 , than to @xmath363 .",
    "the next obvious question is how the small @xmath113 scaling picture evolves as @xmath113 increases . in order to investigate this , we calculated the cloud correlators at the points in parameter space shown in figure  [ fa1 ] .",
    "the most obvious feature of the data , is that the cloud becomes more and more isotropic as @xmath113 increases .",

    ", we plot the ratio @xmath435 as a function of @xmath381 ( figure [ figratio ] ) .",
    "we do so for the data collected at @xmath356 and for @xmath275 . in both cases we see that @xmath435 reaches a plateau that is within 10% of unity .",
    "this is the same degree of isotropy as we obtain on the isotropic line itself . in both cases ,",
    "the plateau is reached at a distance that is a small fraction of the kondo length @xmath238 . in other words",
