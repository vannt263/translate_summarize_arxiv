    "the literature on pygmy or soft dipole resonances  @xcite of medium - mass and heavy nuclei has proliferated in the past two decades .",
    "the interest in such modes was triggered by possible relations of their properties with the symmetry energy of nuclear matter , neutron skins , and consequences of much astrophysical interest . arguably , the meaning of such relations is compromised , when the very definition and existence of pygmy modes remains under debate . nonetheless , it is widely accepted and can be safely considered a given , that non - negligible e1 strength",
    "is observed below particle threshold in many nuclei and that this strength can not be explained ( solely ) as from the low - energy tail of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) . in the following",
    "we will refer to this phenomenon merely as _ low - energy dipole _ ( led ) strength , to avoid the term  pygmy \" , which may mean different things to different readers .",
    "led strength seems to be more significant in more - neutron rich nuclei . merely the non - negligible amount of strength measured and the observation that it often appears in the form of at least one fragmented but resonant - like peak , especially in heavier nuclei , begs the question whether some kind of collective vibrational mode is at play",
    "this is an interesting question for two reasons : ( a ) a collective mode would be of interest in itself and it is intuitive to expect that its properties are related to basic properties of matter or of finite quantum systems ; ( b ) if no special collective transition is at play , then the observed strength must be largely from single - particle transitions , roughly unperturbed and losing only part of their strength to the giant dipole resonance ; such a scenario has already been demonstrated a long time ago  @xcite . in such a case , it seems more constructive to focus the discussion on the shell structure of neutron - rich nuclei , no less an interesting issue .    when considering nuclei as finite - size collections of two types of nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) , quite a few normal dipole modes can be conceived .",
    "one of them is the oscillation of neutron matter against proton matter , associated with the gdr .",
    "another is the oscillation of a layer of outer nucleons against an inert core . among such core - layer modes ,",
    "an isoscalar ( is ) version involving protons and neutrons on a roughly equal footing has only recently attracted attention  @xcite .",
    "the core - layer mode most widely studied is the one whereby an outer layer of ( mostly ) neutrons oscillates against an ( approximately ) isospin - saturated core   in a neutron - rich nucleus .",
    "the existence of such a mode was postulated a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "early microscopic studies predicted the existence of precisely such modes already in stable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the monotonic increase of led strength with neutron excess predicted by such studies and an approximately linear correlation with quantities like the neutron skin and the neutron separation energy seemed to point to a simple resolution to the problem of what the origin and significance of led ( also called pygmy ) strength could be , namely the neutron skin mode ( which _ also _ came to be known as  pygmy \" ) .",
    "however , accumulating experimental data could not be reconciled with such studies in a satisfactory way .",
    "although demonstrations have been attempted , establishing a clear and model - independent correlation of the above mode s centroid energy and strength with the asymmetry or neutron skin of the nucleus has not been possible so far .",
    "that all quantities vary monotonically within a model is not correlation enough .",
    "the attempts are hindered in part by the different energy intervals in which dipole strength is measured or calculated in different nuclei and studies . for such purposes , more promising appears to be the dipole polarizability  @xcite , largely because this quantity is less sensitive to the cutoff imposed on its calculation .",
    "the following open issues deserve particular attention : ( a ) the led strength is often overestimated by microscopic calculations predicting neutron - skin modes , the explanation being that not all strength could be measured ; a characteristic example is offered by relativistic models which claim to predict correctly the threshold dipole strength of unstable sn isotopes , but overestimate the led stength of stable ones ( below threshold ) by a factor of 2 or more  @xcite .",
    "( b ) theoretical studies predict a decrease of the centroid energy of led strength with increasing neutron number , in disagreement with measured strength  @xcite .",
    "( c ) from all the e1 transitions detected via photon scattering , only the lower - energy ones are visible in alpha scattering , i.e. , by an is probe  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the higher - energy transitions belong to the tail of the isovector gdr , while the lower - energy ones are due to a neutron - skin oscillation .",
    "however , to establish experimentally such a tail extending from the gdr region to below threshold in a roughly smooth way remains a difficult task .",
    "we note that studies of the is coherence of the low - energy mode revealed the important role of both proton and neutron configurations  @xcite , leading to destructive coherence in the e1 channel . in this work",
    "we address the above open issues by studying the tin isotopic chain , where quite some data already exist  @xcite and new measurements on exotic species are planned or underway .",
    "therefore , the scope of our methods can be assessed and validated using existing data and we are able to proceed to predictions which could be tested in the near future .",
    "if our predictions are not borne by experiment , our results will help initiate necessary improvements in broadly used theoretical methods ; if they are borne by experiment , they will signify important progress in our understanding of led strength .",
    "we note that a variety of theoretical studies exist already of the dipole response function of sn isotopes  @xcite .",
    "they include semiclassical approaches , the relativistic and non - relativistic random - phase approximation , and extended methods including phonon coupling , while many of them focus only on @xmath2sn .",
    "generally speaking , non - relativistic models tend to interpret the low - energy e1 strength as coming from unperturbed single - particle states , to a large extent , while relativistic models tend to predict a collective neutron - skin mode below or just above particle threshold .",

    "the qrpa transition strengths obtained with the corrected operators ( [ eq : e1_is_mod ] ) and ( [ eq : e1_iv_mod ] ) are the same as with the uncorrected forms , except of course for the spurious state .",

    "we will make use of the single - neutron unit @xmath47    in the present study we use the gogny d1s interaction  @xcite , as well as a unitarily transformed argonne v18 interaction supplemented with a phenomenological density - dependent two - body term  @xcite .",

    "the theoretical trends are more uniform than the experimental ones , but the overal quantitative comparison of the summed strength up to 27  mev is very satisfactory .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ucom(srg)@xmath51 interaction predicts much more strength above 27  mev than the gogny interaction .",

    "we also note the interesting result that the large enhancement factor corresponding to our quasi - realistic interaction does not entail disagreement with measured cross sections in the energy region of the gdr , but rather enhancement of strength at higher energies compared to other models .    the low - energy strength and how it compares with data will be discussed throughout sec .",

    "the area of a disk or circle is propotional to the strength .",

    "the gdr appears fragmented into at least two structures .",
    "the disks at high energy , above 25  mev , correspond to the high - lying compression mode .",
    "apart from these structures , we notice that the low - energy spectrum in the is channel is dominated , in all isotopes , by a strong is - led transition at about 10  mev .",
    "this result is in obvious qualitative agreement with the skyrme - qrpa results of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the neutron - rich isotopes",
    "this transition appears to carry also considerable e1 strength .",
    "important differences between the two interactions can be pointed out : for the gogny d1s interaction , the energy and is strength of the strong is - led state drops rather smoothly as the neutron number increases .",
    "beyond @xmath59 the changes appear to accelerate . for the ucom(srg)@xmath51",
    "the energy reaches a minimum at @xmath60 and then rises again up to @xmath61 .",

    "upwards the is - led states carry apparently more e1 strength than in the case of gogny d1s .    in all cases , considerable ( by comparison ) and",
    "fragmented e1 strength appears between the major is - led state and the gdr . as in our similar study of ca isotopes  @xcite",
    ", we note the rich structure of the response in the whole energy region up to the gdr .    many of the differences we observe between fig .",
    "[ fig : response](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : response](b ) at low energies are manifestations of the different shell structure predicted by the two interactions .",
    "the neutron single - particle energies , defined as the eigenvalues of the single - particle hamiltonian , are quite relevant . using the gogny d1s interaction ,",
    "we obtain a well defined energy gap of about 6  mev between the intruder , valence state @xmath63 and the lowest neutron @xmath64 state , namely @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath2sn is a closed - shell nucleus , while @xmath66sn has @xmath67 , its last bound neutron state , doubly occupied .",
    "by contrast , with the ucom(srg)@xmath51 interaction we obtain much weaker spin - orbit splittings , and as a result , @xmath63 lies almost midway between the @xmath68 and the @xmath64 shells , and in fact closer to the latter .",
    "due to this behavior , @xmath2sn is not a proper closed - shell nucleus , while pairing collapses mid - shell for @xmath69sn and @xmath70sn , namely the isotopes for which kinks are observed in the evolution of the lowest eigenenergies in fig .",
    "[ fig : response](b ) .",
    "another result obtained with the ucom(srg)@xmath51 interaction , is that the entire @xmath64 shell is unbound or very weakly bound ( the same holds for @xmath63 up to @xmath71 ) .",
    "thus the dramatic shift of strengths to lower energies for @xmath72 signifies the activation of barely bound hole states .",
    "shell defects such as the above have been discussed before  @xcite , but , as seen also in sec .",
    "[ subsec : gdr ] , they do not spoil the description of very collective phenomena like electric giant resonances  @xcite .",
    "we will proceed to a few more comparisons between the two interactions and with data in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fds ] , until quantitative arguments speak against the use of the above interaction in ( q)rpa studies of low - energy dipole response .    in the following",
    "we will focus on excitation energies up to about 15  mev .",
    "we expect the excitation energies to be overestimated by qrpa in this region , due to the lack of explicit long - range correlations and coupling to complex configurations and surface vibrations , as inferred from a variety of studies on different nuclei ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the overestimation of excitation energies can be avoided already at the mean field level by considering the nucleon effective mass @xmath73 approximately equal to the bare nucleon mass @xmath74 .",
    "however , the in - medium effective mass resulting self - consistently from the present interactions is very low ( @xmath75 for gogny d1s ) . as a result ,",
    "the density of single - particle states close to the fermi level is too low , the lowest @xmath76 energies in hfb are too high , on average , in comparison to phenomenological woods - saxon energies used , e.g. , in @xcite , and the associated dipole strength appears too high by about 3 mev . as a rule of thumb , we will therefore consider all energies overestimated by about 3  mev in the following , as we did in ref .",
    "such a value is consistent also with the energetic discrepancies between ( q)rpa results and data observed in other studies ( e.g. , ref .",
    "of course , the closer we move to the gdr region , the more obsolete such a shift should be considered .",
    "to a good approximation , though , our discussion of results up to 15  mev excitation energies should be relevant for an actual energy region up to , roughly , 12  mev .",
    "this should be kept in mind in what follows .",
    "another relevant observation is that the particle continuum and resonant particle states are not treated exactly in configuration - space rpa .",
    "it may be owing to this deficiency that , for example , the particle threshold of the stable isotopes , defined as the binding energy of the @xmath77 neutron state , is found at around @xmath78  mev with the gogny force , but the first unperturbed @xmath79 @xmath76 transition to an unbound state , i.e. , effectively the hfb particle threshold in this channel , appears well above 10  mev .",
    "first , we look at the properties of the first and strong is - led state . in fig .  [",
    "fig : propsisled ]    we plot , as a function of mass number @xmath23 and for both interactions , the energy , is strength and e1 strength of this state . as already observed , these properties vary rather smoothly in the case of the gogny interaction .",
    "one reason for the less smooth behaviour in the case of the ucom(srg)@xmath51 interaction is that there is more than one strong states , while we only plot the properties of the first one . aside from this , we observe that the energy and is strength is rather similar with both interactions . for @xmath80sn ,",
    "is strength has been observed in @xmath81 experiments shared between two fragmented structures at about 5.5 and 6.5  mev  @xcite .",
    "our calculations predict a strong is state at about 8.5 - 9  mev and given the above - mentioned energetic shift , are in concordance with the experimental findings .",
    "it is worth noting that the amount of is strength of the first is - led state is similar with both interactions and the values are large , corresponding to a percentage of , at the very least , @xmath82 , and reaching up to about @xmath83 in the more neutron - rich species , of the total calculated energy - weighted sum of is strength .",
    "this finding corroborates the collective character of this state .",
    "the is strength has not been extracted from data for any of the sn isotopes , therefore we can not compare the calculated is strength with data .",
    "however , is strength of similar magnitude and at the same energy region has been observed in other nuclei  @xcite .",
    "before we turn to the e1 strength , it is instructive to inspect the representative transition densities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trden ] .    , scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in the @xmath84 isotope @xmath85sn the is - led state corresponds to the isospin - forbidden e1 transition studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in other isotopes",
    "the transition densities retain a similar character , namely that of the oscillation of an outer layer of nucleons versus an inner core . in general ,",
    "both protons and neutrons participate in the outer layer . beyond a certain neutron number the neutrons",
    "dominate the outer layer and one may speak , at least in a loose sense , of an oscillation of a neutron skin against a core .",
    "it depends on the model at what neutron number and how smoothly the transition to such a neutron - skin mode takes place . for the gogny d1s interaction , this transition happens very smoothly between the shell closures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with protons always participating in the outer layer . beyond @xmath1",
    "an abrupt transition takes place to a rather pure neutron - skin mode , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trden](a ) for @xmath66sn . at this point",
    "the loosely bound neutron hole states of the @xmath64 shell become active .",
    "the neutron transition densities become more extended . in the case of the ucom(srg)@xmath51 interaction , an abrupt transition from a",
    "very is mode ( same transition densities for protons and neutrons ) to a neutron - dominated mode takes place beyond @xmath86 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trden ] . the transition densities change quite smoothly beyond that neutron number towards being more neutron dominated . beyond @xmath1",
    "the highest neutron hole states are no longer bound .",
    "the above differences are reflected on the e1 strengths of the is - led , also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : propsisled ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the minimum is not reached for the @xmath84 isotope , but a heavier one . in @xmath85sn protons",
    "slightly dominate in the outer layer , this asymmetry being from the coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "we also observe an increase of led strength beyond @xmath2sn , in agreement with studies based on skyrme functionals  @xcite .    the total e1 strength below 9  mev has been measured in @xmath87sn  @xcite , @xmath55sn  @xcite and @xmath80sn  @xcite and it was found to add up to 0.174 , 0.204 and 0.345  @xmath88@xmath89 , respectively .",
    "we notice that the first is - led alone , as calculated with the ucom(srg)@xmath51 interaction , carries almost 10 times this strength .",
    "this result , namely that within qrpa the ucom(srg)@xmath51 interaction overestimates the low - energy e1 strength , is consistent with the findings of refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "it provides useful guidance to further improvements of the currently very simple prescription used to determine the phenomenological three - body force .    as in the case of the stable ca isotopes  @xcite",
    ", our present results suggest that the first is - led state is a universal phenomenon , not particular to @xmath84 nuclei . in the case of @xmath90 nuclei ,",
    "such a state has been produced also by some qrpa and semi - classical calculations based on skyrme interactions  @xcite , but is missing in other models , both relativistic and non - relativistic . generating dipole collectivity at low energies may have to do with the implementation of the ( q)rpa including , as has been speculated before  @xcite , the consistent treatment of the residual spin - orbit force .",
    "this is an interesting puzzle that warrants further attention in the future .    in what follows",
    "we will restrict our discussion to the gogny d1s interaction , which consistently appears in good agreement with the data .",
    "we now take a closer look at how our results with the qrpa and the gogny d1s force compare with existing data at low energies , to validate the model further . summed e1 strength up to almost 9 mev has been measured in nuclear resonance fluoresence ( nrf ) experiments for @xmath87sn  @xcite , @xmath55sn and @xmath80sn  @xcite .",
    "for the unstable isotopes @xmath91sn and @xmath2sn the amount of strength was measured , with large errorbars , between the particle threshold and the gdr  @xcite .    as already emphasized , one must take an energetic shift into account when comparing qrpa results with data at low energies , approximately equal to 3  mev .",
    "once must also keep in mind that fragmentation from effects beyond qrpa may shift a small amount of strength beyond the energy region in which we make comparisons .",
    "we also note that the strength of individual qrpa states is sensitive to the ingredients of each calculation , precisely because it is very small . finally , the nrf measurements were less precise towards the particle threshold and some e1 strength possibly went undetected .",
    "for all these reasons , deviations are to be expected .    in fig",
    "[ fig : sume1exp ] we display the summed e1 strength as calculated within qrpa in various energy regions :    for the lowest , is - led state only ; for all states up to 10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 , or 15  mev ; and for states between 12 and 15  mev . the value of a single - neutron unit as defined by eq.([eq : bsn ] )",
    "is also shown  .",
    "we observe that the strength measured below threshold ( @xmath92sn ) is compatible with the strength of the is - led or even , in light of the above discussion , the strength calculated up to about 11 - 12 mev .",
    "we find that also the strength measured above threshold ( @xmath93sn , detected at approximately @xmath94  mev ) is compatible with our calculations ( @xmath95  mev ) .",
    "this result is very gratifying and lends great confidence to the interpretations and predictions that will follow next .",
    "an important conclusion that follows from our results is that the strong enhancement of e1 strength measured in the exotic isotopes is not due to their large neutron excess , as postulated in refs .",
    "@xcite , but simply due to the energy region accessed , compared to the stable species .",
    "in fact , we predict that the e1 strength below threshold should be comparable in all sn isotopes with @xmath4 , with much of it coming from states other than the is - led mode",
    ". moreover , the summed is dipole strength below threshold should amount to a few per cent of the is ewsr for _ all _ sn isotopes with @xmath3 ( generally increasing with @xmath96 up to @xmath97 ) .",
    "last but not least , according to our results a significant amount of e1 strength is expected around threshold and still below the gdr region for all isotopes .",
    "regardless of the mechanism that gives rise to this strength , to which we will return in secs .",
    "[ subsec : split ] and [ subsec : coll ] , its existence alone could be highly consequential for nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "our predictions for the exhaustion of the classical trk sum rule and the total energy - weighted is sum rule ( is - ewsr ) in the even @xmath98sn isotopes , based on the gogny d1s interaction , are as follows : below threshold no more than , approximately , 1% of the trk sum ( much less than this value for @xmath85sn ) and approximately @xmath99 of the is - ewsr is exhausted ; below 12  mev ( 15  mev calculated energy ) , in all cases with even @xmath100 , a few percent ( typically @xmath101 ) of the trk _ and _ the is - ewsr is exhausted .",
    "the trk percentage below 12  mev would not necessarily vary smoothly with @xmath23 .",
    "the centroid energy of e1 strength below threshold has been reported  @xcite for @xmath102sn as equal to 8.0(1 ) ,  8.2(1 ) ,  8.6(2 ) , respectively , i.e. , rising with @xmath23 .",
    "our calculated centroids up to 12  mev are , respectively , 10.03 ,  10.02 ,  9.98  mev .",
    "the energy seems to drop very slowly with @xmath23 , in agreement with other theoretical calculations and in disagreement with the data as discussed in  @xcite . given ( a ) the small amounts of strength involved , ( b ) the fact that these amounts are spread over several states , ( c ) that higher - order configurations will result in a redistribution of these small amounts over many more states influencing in unknown ways the centroid ( even if the total strength does not change much ) and of course d ) the unavoidable arbitrariness of the energy cutoff which we have introduced , we are unable to reach a solid conclusion , but we do find likely that a correct description of the centroid energy systematics below threshold is beyond the capacities of ( q)rpa .      the isospin structure of led strength that comes out of our calculations is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : isosplit ] , for four representative isotopes .",
    "we see once again that most of the is strength is carried by the first state , but e1 strength appears throughout the low - energy region up to a couple of mev above the experimentally accessed region in @xmath92sn ( states shown with thin gray lines , above roughly @xmath103  mev in qrpa ) .",
    "our result is manifestly in line with the observation of isospin splitting of the led strength in @xmath80sn and other heavy nuclei  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : isosplit ] we also indicate the value of the single - neutron unit in each nucleus , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsn ] ) , keeping in mind that a single - proton unit is @xmath104 times that of a neutron unit .",
    "we observe that most transitions are consistent with single - particle states , leaving no strong grounds for expecting collectivity in this channel .",
    "we will return to this subtle issue in sec .",
    "[ subsec : coll ] .",
    "the splitting of the spectrum into different bunches of states is further demonstrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : isosplit ] .    some of the states in fig .  [",
    "fig : dwba]a demonstrate a diffraction minimum , reminiscent of that in the is - led of @xmath84 nuclei as well as @xmath107ca .",
    "interestingly , the first is - led state of @xmath55sn does not . in order to further investigate the kinship of the strong is - led modes in various nuclei , a dedicated study of the transverse form factors , accessible in transverse electron scattering , appears worthwhile in future .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : dwba]b it becomes clear that qrpa generates a bunch of eigenstates with similar form factors , non - negligible is strength and in close proximity energetically ( around 13  mev ) .",
    "in fact , we find that between 12 mev and the gdr approximately @xmath83 of the is ewsr is exhausted .",
    "this value is clearly lower than the strength detected above threshold in ref .",
    "@xcite , but roughly in agreement with another non - relativistic study  @xcite .      our attempt to assess the collectivity of e1 strength closer to threshold ( in the region of 11 - 15  mev in our calculations ) with the help of single - neutron particle states was inconclusive .",
    "the bunching of states discussed above may be indicative of a collective mode , fragmented through the landau mechanism .",
    "a conclusive analysis of the coherence of dipole states is difficult , because the treatment of the center - of - mass motion introduces subtle ambiguities .",
    "indeed , let us begin with the assumption that a transition is 100% of single - particle ( or @xmath76 ) character .",
    "this transition entails a finite transition matrix element of the displacement operator .",
    "this must be compensated by the recoil of the rest of the nucleus , or at the very least another single - particle excitation of opposite displacement .",
    "therefore our assumption was wrong and more than one configurations must contribute to any ( q)rpa wavefunction always .",
    "of course , if an eigenstate received a large percentage of its norm from a single configuration , we could not argue against its single - particle character .",
    "interestingly , we found that hardly any eigenstate is made up by more than @xmath108 by one configuration .",
    "the majority of eigenstates receive contributions from most @xmath109 @xmath76 configurations .",
    "regarding the coherence of an excited state in the e1 channel , it makes a difference whether one considers the bare nucleon charges , in which case neutron states do not contribute to the e1 strength _",
    "at all _ , or whether one considers the usual effective charges .",
    "we stress that the total e1 strength of any given ( q)rpa state ( except the spurious one ) is not affected by the choice of effective charges , but the individual contribution of each single - particle configuration strongly is .",
    "an alternative way of diagnosing collectivity in qrpa is to compare the qrpa strength function with the unperturbed one .",
    "we performed this exercise in the case of @xmath55sn and show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : vres ] , for both the is and e1 strength function .",
    "we started with the unperturbed spectrum and obtained results for various fractions @xmath110 of the residual interaction , ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 , in which case the full qrpa result is obtained .",
    "in the is channel , the collectivity of the first eigenstate is clearly demonstrated .",
    "this state collects more and more is strength from higher - lying states , as @xmath110 increases , while its energy ends up well below the unperturbed spectrum . regarding the e1 strength function",
    ", we can clearly see that , as @xmath110 increases , this energy region is depleted of its strength , which appears to be attracted more and more by the higher - lying gdr .",
    "a relatively small amount remains when @xmath111 .",
    "this result implies that , rather than being part of the gdr , the e1 strength in this energy region consists of the remainders of dipole strength that failed to join the gdr , as first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and in other non - relativistic studies of various nuclei  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , together these states carry a non - negligible amount of strength and , as already discussed , could be excited strongly by other operators involving momentum transfer .",
    "we have checked that similar results are obtained for @xmath2sn .",
    "to summarize , the relatively low is and e1 strength carried by the individual states close to and above particle threshold speak against their collective character , but the energetic proximity of states with similar form factors supports a collective scenario . clearly , data other than @xmath112 strength should become available before we can reach a consensus as to what determines the dipole response in this scarcely explored energy region .",
    "in this work we have studied the low - energy dipole strength distribution along the sn isotopic chain in both the is and iv electric channels , with the help of the self - consistent qrpa with finite - range interactions .",
    "we have used two types of interaction : the gogny d1s force and a quasi - realistic interaction consisting of the unitarily transformed argonne v18 interaction at the two - body level plus a phenomenological three - body contact term . we compared our results with existing data .",
    "as in previous applications , we have found that the quasi - realistic interaction overestimates the led strength .",
    "our results with the gogny interaction are very well compatible with existing data , except that the centroid energy of e1 strength below threshold is predicted to drop with neutron number .",
    "this discrepancy is attributed to the limitations of qrpa in describing precisely the fragmentation of strength .    on the basis of our calculations with the gogny d1s interaction",
    "we have tackled open issues regarding the properties of led strength , including its collectivity and its so - called isospin splitting , and we have made testable predictions .",
    "in particular , we found that from @xmath0 and up to the @xmath1 shell closure ( @xmath2sn ) the lowest - energy part of the is - led spectrum is dominated by a collective transition whose properties vary smoothly with neutron number and which can not be interpreted as a neutron - skin oscillation .",
    "for the neutron - rich species this state contributes to the e1 strength below particle threshold , but much more e1 strength is carried by other , weak but numerous transitions around or above threshold .",
    "we found that strong structural changes in the spectrum take effect beyond @xmath1 , namely increased led strength and lower excitation energies .",
    "we therefore predict that ( a ) the summed is strength below particle threshold shall be of the same order of magnitude for @xmath3 , ( b ) the summed e1 strength up to approximately 12  mev shall be similar for @xmath3  mev , while ( c ) the summed e1 strength below threshold shall be of the same order of magnitude for @xmath4 and much weaker for the lighter , more - symmetric isotopes .",
    "our results are in general agreement with other non - relativistic studies  @xcite . however , in some studies no collective is mode is predicted  .",
    "the discrepancy seemingly has to do with the rpa implementation and not with the interaction used .",
    "finally , we observe a possibly radical disagreement with relativistic rpa models , in that the latter overestimate the strength below threshold in stable isotopes and predict a collective , neutron - skin excitation at threshold in the unstable isotopes , but no resonance at lower energies  @xcite .",
    "experiments in preparation or under analysis will be able to substantially constrain theoretical interpretations of led strength as well as corroborate or refute the universality of the low - energy is collective state  @xcite predicted in this work along the sn isotopic chain .",
