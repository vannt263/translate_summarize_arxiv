    "excitonic energy spectrum of molecular aggregates experiences essential transformation due to the presence of high - frequency intramolecular vibrations . as a result , coupling between electronic excitations and intramolecular vibrations known as vibronic coupling turn to be responsible for a host of spectroscopically - observed phenomena .",
    "the vibronic effects have been investigated intensively by different theoretical methods since the foundation of molecular ( frenkel ) exciton theory @xcite . along with the advance of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques , some new insights related to coupling between electronic degrees of freedom of molecular aggregates and intramolecular vibrations",
    "were observed in third - order spectroscopic signals , for example , in two - dimensional ( 2d ) coherent spectra demonstrating vibrational wave - packet motion , long - lived coherences , vibrational anisotropy beats , polaron formation , etc.@xcite .",
    "probably the most extensively discussed issue lately is the impact of discrete vibrational resonances on the electronic coherences and _ vice versa . _",
    "these coherences are observed in the 2d electronic spectroscopy , but its possible role in energy transfer is currently under discussion @xcite .",
    "range and diversity of molecular systems , where vibronic coupling is very significant , appears to be extremely wide .",
    "historically , molecular crystals were the first systems where the vibronic coupling was considered and the theoretical basis of the spectral characterization was developed by analyzing their stationary spectra @xcite .",
    "further development of the theoretical approach was addressed to studies of vibronic excitations in h and j aggregates and in molecular films @xcite .",
    "strong coupling to discrete intramolecular high - frequency modes of the @xmath0 stretch vibration at around @xmath1 together with the strong electrostatic interaction between the molecules are the most evident properties of the j - aggregates .",
    "coupling to discrete low - frequency intramolecular modes ( 160  @xmath2 , for example@xcite ) has also been considered .",
    "significant vibronic features are prevalent in spectra of aggregated and strongly - coupled molecular dimeric dyes , the formation of which is usually the first step towards the large - scale molecular aggregation @xcite .    photosynthetic pigment  protein ( p  p ) complexes could be considered as yet another class of molecular systems , where weak vibronic coupling ( however , only recently observed ) was found to be important @xcite . since pigment molecules within p ",
    "p formations are weakly - coupled and the surrounding protein framework is ready to dissipate any vibrational motion of the pigments , the domination of electronic coupling over vibronic effects is commonly assumed .",
    "therefore , long - lasting oscillations in coherent 2d spectra were initially explained by purely excitonic coherences @xcite .",
    "recently , vibronic components and mixing of both , electronic and vibronic , ingredients have been reported @xcite .",
    "if we were to represent the above - mentioned systems as points on a schematic two - dimensional phase space , where the axes indicate vibrational frequency and electronic resonance interaction , the most of it would be covered as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:(a)-experimentally - and ] .",
    "we can make a classification of the points scattered over the plot by considering the possible time - resolved experiment with ultra - short laser pulses of typical bandwidth of @xmath3 @xmath2 . in the top ",
    "left corner of the figure we then have the weakly - coupled systems with high - frequency vibrations . in this case",
    "the experiment would resolve a few peaks of the vibronic progression at most and the splittings due to electronic coupling would be overlapping .",
    "the mixed case where electronic resonance interactions and vibronic progression would be resolvable along with strong quantum - mechanical mixing of both types of transitions , is present in the top - right part of the scheme .",
    "the laser spectrum would cover only a few peaks in this case . on the bottom ",
    "left corner we have the mixed systems again , but the laser pulse spectrum could cover all peaks . and , finally , on the bottom ",
    "right corner we have the case where the full vibrational progression could be observed in the experiment and the electronic splitting would be well - resolved .",

    "p complexes with high and low - frequency vibrations ( * d1 * and * d3 * ) , the j - aggregate ( * d2 * ) and a molecular dye ( * d4 * ) .",
    "therefore , the conclusions drawn from the results of model systems are general in terms of its application to different molecular aggregates .",
    "various models of a molecule coupled to continuum of bath vibrations were developed within the framework of the perturbative system  bath interaction expansion@xcite .",
    "the bath is then described by the spectral density function , which represents auto - correlations of the electronic _ site _ energy fluctuations due to the environment .",
    "the most popular model assumes the brownian particle - like vibrational motion of the molecule in a solvent @xcite .",
    "this model is usually enough to obtain proper spectral lineshapes in simulations of systems with no expressed high - frequency vibrations at fixed temperature . for systems with well - resolved high - frequency modes of vibrations",
    "the spectral density approach is applied by including a @xmath7-shaped or finite - bandwidth peak into the bath spectral density function .",
    "the @xmath7-peak does give ever - lasting coherent beats in the coherent 2d spectra@xcite , while in case of finite - width peak decay of oscillations is obtained due to pure dephasing @xcite .",
    "however , this method has two deficiencies .",
    "firstly , it neglects the effects caused by quantum - mechanical mixing of the vibronic levels of different molecules when the vibronic splitting is comparable to the intermolecular excitonic coupling .",
    "secondly , it does not include vibrational relaxation as the vibrations are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at fixed temperature",
    ". these could be important effects when the coupling to vibrations is strong .",
    "there have been several studies of nonlinear coherent spectra of molecular dimers with exciton  vibronic mixing included @xcite .",

    "the hamiltonian of an aggregate of realistic molecules involves three components : electronic states , vibrational structure for each electronic state and the coulomb coupling between all electronic and vibronic levels .",

    "increasing coupling produces the excitonic splitting which can be seen as the red shift of the lowest energy state and appearance of two ladder - type progressions .",
    "however , the interaction of vibronic and electronic states induces repulsion of the energy levels , which is mostly evident where the ladders experience crossing , i.e. in the vicinity of the so - called avoided crossing regions @xcite .",

    "the information about the phase of oscillations provides additional information about the ongoing processes .",
    "therefore , fitting the experimental data by means of the simulated fourier maps would lead to unambiguous conclusions .",

    "quantum mechanical description of _ electronic _ excitation treats the rigid constituent molecule s skeleton as the potential energy surface for electrons .",
    "the resulting electron density dynamics after photo - excitation can be approximated by the oscillatory electric dipole moment .",
    "thus , the coupling between the molecules produces the discrete energy levels in the single excited manifold of the _ electronic _ aggregate . in a similar way ,",
    "if intramolecular vibrations are considered in an isolated molecule , the harmonic / anharmonic oscillator model for the electronic ground and excited states can be applied .",
    "this also results in discrete spectrum of _ vibrational _ levels .",
    "these two pictures merge due to the intermolecular coupling and the electronic and vibrational subsystems mix up .",
    "it is then natural to try to quantify , how much of electronic or vibrational character is inherited in the composite system .",
    "however , this often leads to many ambiguities , for example , in linear spectra of j - aggregates@xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts to unambiguously distinguish between vibrational , vibronic and excitonic coherences visible as oscillations in 2d spectra . however , the question of how to do that is proper only if mixing in the system is low .",
    "as it was shown here , two conditions for low mixing can be distinguished : ( i ) the coupling between vibrational and electronic subsystem has to be weak ( small huang",
    " rhys factor ) ; ( ii ) the system must not be in a vicinity of exciton  vibronic resonance , represented by the avoided crossing region in the energy spectrum .",
    "these conditions are best met for high - frequency intramolecular vibrations in weakly - coupled p ",
    "p complexes and low - frequency vibrations in strongly - coupled aggregates , the * d1 * and * d2 * models , respectively .    in the case of substantial mixing of the coherences of electronic and vibrational character , the information about the transition composition can be evaluated from coherent oscillations in some cases .",
    "it is most obvious in the * d2 * model representing the case of the j - aggregate , when the electronic system is strongly coupled to low - frequency vibration ( second row in fig .",
    "[ fig : osci - d1_d2]b ) . despite the strong",
    "mixing the fourier map for the electronic frequency ( @xmath164 ) contains diagonal - symmetric features , similar to those present in the weak mixing case . in the *",
    "d4 * model , which stands as an equivalent of the strongly - coupled dimeric dye , the mixture of coherences for @xmath174 and @xmath153 can also be disentangled ( @xmath114 , fig .",
    "[ fig : osci - d3_d4]b ) .",
    "firstly , the fourier map at @xmath174 contains diagonal - symmetric peaks , which would suggest , that this particular coherence is rather electronic . secondly , there are features in the map at @xmath153 separated by @xmath1 and @xmath175 as well as the peak on the diagonal exhibiting high - frequency oscillations .",
    "the later fact as well as the obviously stronger oscillations below the diagonal shows that the origin of the @xmath1 oscillation is rather vibrational .",
    "the similar analysis can be applied to the * d4 * model with @xmath115 , where the mere evidence of vibrational content is the diagonal oscillating peak in the @xmath153 map .",
    "one can not discriminate between coherences of dominating electronic or vibrational character in weakly - interacting photosynthetic complexes , coupled to low - frequency vibrations .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the * d3 * model in both cases of weak and strong electron  phonon coupling ( first and second rows in fig .",
    "[ fig : osci - d3_d4 ] , respectively ) .",
    "the coherences in the system are highly mixed and no typical patterns , which were present in the fourier maps of the other systems , are found here . the fourier map in case of strong coupling to vibrations",
    "is composed of many contributions , evolving in the ground and excited states ( the second row in fig .",
    "[ fig : osci - d3_d4 ] ) , thus , indicating complete state character mixing .",
    "hence , the _ electronic _ or _ vibrational _ transitions are properly qualified , while _ vibronic _ and _ how - much - vibronic _ is a vague concept and should be avoided .",
    "instead one should treat such coherences as simply mixed , which is completely a proper concept in quantum mechanics .",
    "the fact that some coherences are less visible in the fourier maps is to high degree related to their lifetimes .",
    "obviously , oscillations which decay fast will be vaguely captured by the fourier transform or even will not be present in the maps at all .",
    "let us now concentrate on the maximum of the fourier amplitude dependence on frequency , @xmath148 , in case of @xmath114 , presented by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : maximum - amplitudes - of ] .",
    "the widths of the peaks are given by the lifetime of the corresponding oscillations .",
    "the lifetime of the vibrational ground state coherence depends only on the overlap of vibrational frequency and bath spectral density .",
    "it can be deduced from eqs .   and .",
    "for example , the lifetime of @xmath177 coherence @xmath178 is @xmath179  ps for @xmath126 and the width of the corresponding peak in the @xmath148 dependence is @xmath180 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maximum - amplitudes - of]a and d ) .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath119 coherence is @xmath181  fs , thus , the corresponding peak in @xmath148 is very broad and , therefore , hardly distinguishable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maximum - amplitudes - of]b and c ) .",
    "this effect essentially depends on the spectral density function ( including the shape and the amplitude ) and its value at the corresponding vibrational frequency @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of coherences in the excited state manifold are not that trivial .",
    "on one hand , transfer rates relating electronic states of purely electronic aggregates depend on the absolute value of the bath spectral density at the corresponding frequency . additionally , they depend on extend of delocalization of a particular state . on the other hand ,",
    "transfer rates between vibronic states of a single molecule are the same as of the ground state vibrational states . in our case , these two pictures are merged and the lifetimes of mixed coherences can not be expressed in simple terms .",
    "it has been shown , that the lifetimes of vibronic coherences increase significantly , if the electronic transitions are close to vibrational frequencies even if the huang  rhys factor is small ( @xmath182 ) @xcite .",
    "this is evident in the @xmath148 dependencies , as well : the lifetime of the @xmath183 oscillation in the * d1 * model is smaller than the corresponding lifetime of the frequency oscillation in the * d4 * model by factor of @xmath184 while the lifetimes of the @xmath156 coherences are identical .",
    "if compared , @xmath185 oscillations in the * d2 * model decay at least @xmath186 times faster than the @xmath183 oscillations in the * d4 * model .    if the huang ",
    "rhys factors are large ( @xmath187 ) , low - frequency vibrational coherences in the ground state decay faster than in the case of weak coupling to vibrations discussed above ( see dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : maximum - amplitudes - of ] ) .",
    "this is due to the lower value of the reorganization energy , which is @xmath188 for @xmath115 ( cf .",
    "@xmath189 for @xmath114 ) .",
    "stronger interaction with vibrations induces more mixing in the system .",
    "therefore , we can see long - lived coherences of @xmath190 in the * d2 * model .",
    "we can thus conclude that the electronic coherences effectively borrow some lifetime from the vibrational coherences due to the quantum mechanical mixing .",
    "the mixing and borrowing of the dipole strength in excitonic systems is a well - known phenomenon , however the lifetime borrowing is poorly discussed .",
    "energetic disorder is yet another important parameter for the coherent state evolution .",
    "it was shown for molecular dimer with vibrations , that in the case of substantial energy disorder , coherences of prevailing vibrational / vibronic character will dominate over those of rather electronic character @xcite . from the discussion above",
    "it follows that this effect will be more significant for rather pure systems : weakly - coupled p ",
    "p complexes with high - frequency vibrations and j - aggregates ( * d1 * and * d2 * models , respectively ) . in both cases",
    "vibrational coherences will dominate in the fourier maps , while the electronic coherences will dephase fast because of combined influence of the energetic disorder and the lifetime of the state . in the mixed systems ( * d3 * and * d4 * ) the result will be more complicated .",
    "the reason behind is that the mixing occurs when resonances match , i.e. at the exciton - vibronic resonance .",
    "disorder will make the matching less significant for most of ensemble members show less mixing .",
    "hence , the electronic and vibronic character for a disordered ensemble is better defined and should be better identified in experiments .",
    "in this paper , theory of molecular aggregate with intramolecular vibrations for coherent spectroscopy was presented .",
    "it accounts for incoherent and coherent effects caused by excitonic coupling and exciton ",
    "vibronic interaction .",
    "the molecular dimer model is used for simulation purposes of typical systems in a wide range of parameters to reflect pigment ",
    "protein complexes , j - aggregates or dimeric molecular dyes .    regarding the question of distinguishing the electronic , vibronic or vibrational coherences ,",
    "we conclude that the question itself is fully defined and proper only if the character of states is pure ( electronic or vibrational ) .",
    "we have shown that such a separation is indeed possible for systems , where the resonant coupling and vibrational frequency is off - resonant , i.e. the system is away from the so - called exciton ",
    "vibronic resonance .",
    "the analysis of oscillations in mixed systems is of qualitative significance and allows us to to tell if the specified oscillation is of the mixed origin .",
    "the frequencies of transitions , involved in the mixture can be resolved .",
    "the positions of oscillating features must be taken into careful consideration when analyzing experimental data .",
    "there are spectral regions of mixed systems , where oscillations exceptionally due to coherences in the ground or excited states can be found , thus providing more information about system composition .",
    "for example , the property that features in the fourier maps are asymmetric with respect to the diagonal is the signature that the corresponding state is mixed .",
    "lifetime of excitonic coherences is mostly determined by the coupling to discrete modes of intramolecular vibrations .",
    "these modes , on their own , are coupled to the continuum of low - frequency bath fluctuations , represented by the spectral density .",
    "thus , the overlap of the spectral density function and frequencies of intramolecular vibrations as well as the form of spectral density function directly influences the lifetime of electronic coherences .",
    "singly - excited eigenstates are obtained by unitary transformation , and we get the same symmetry properties as for    @xmath191    here the first sum is over different chromophores , the second and third sum is over the vibrational levels of the whole aggregate and finally the sum over @xmath98 is over the different vibrational modes ( which is identical to the number of sites since each site has one vibrational coordinate ) .",
