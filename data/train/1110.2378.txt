    "high - energy heavy - ion collisions show a vary rapid transition from a quantum mechanical initial state to a thermalized state known as a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this poses a fundamental , conceptual theory problem , namely how the necessary production of entropy can be reconciled with the t - invariance of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "one could argue in analogy to the situation in the einstein - rosen - podolsky paradox that all produced particles stay in a highly entangled state which only collapses when a measurement is performed and that entropy production occurs only in that moment .",
    "nevertheless , a hydrodynamic description of the quark - gluon plasma seems to be possible long before any measurement takes place .",
    "the resolution of this apparent contradictionis of interest for a wide spectrum of physical phenomena , e.  g. , reheating of the early universe after the end of the presumed period of inflationary growth , when the universe transitioned from an exponentially inflated vacuum bubble to the hot cosmos we observe today .",
    "another example is the gravitational collapse of matter into a black hole , which behaves as if it were a thermal object . in this review",
    "we will focus on the thermalization of strongly interacting matter after the collision of two relativistic heavy nuclei , thereby forming a quark - gluon plasma , a process which has the immense advantage that it can be studied in great detail in laboratory experiments .",
    "for example it is known that the quark gluon matter in a heavy - ion collision behaves like a nearly ideal thermal fluid already after @xmath0 fm/@xmath1 .",
    "justifying the use of thermodynamics in the context of quantum field theory is an extremely difficult task in any case , even for phenomena described by quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , where the quantum field theory is under excellent control .",
    "for qcd the situation is even more difficult due to the strong coupling dynamics , which permits analytical calculations only in very much constrained situations . to illustrate the extent of the problem let us note that even in quantum mechanics the problem of thermalization is far from being settled .",
    "a nice example is a recent study@xcite , where a finite one - dimensional quantum system was shown to thermalize only when the so called `` eigenstate thermalization hypothesis '' ( eth@xcite ) is satisfied .",
    "rigol@xcite stresses that quantum and classical thermal states have very different natures .",
    "eth claims that each eigenstate of the hamiltonian is related to a thermal state which is reached by the `` de - phasing '' of the coherent components of the quantum state .    while we do not want to discuss the merits of this specific concept in more detail",
    ", it serves as an example illustrating the fact that the de - phasing or decoherence of a quantum state constitutes one way ( if not _ the _ way ) to generate entropy .",
    "generated entropy generally is proportional to the number of lost bits of information .",
    "consequently phases carry an important part of the information contained in a quantum state , their loss generates a significant amount of entropy .",
    "a general mechanism for losing information about the state of a quantum system is the entanglement of its wave function with that of its environment .",
    "this mechanism obviously does not apply to an isolated system .",
    "the conservation of the von neumann entropy for an isolated system implies that any information encoded in its quantum state is never lost , at least in principle .",
    "however , the information may become encoded in observables of such complexity or requiring such a degree of experimental precision that its retrieval is impractical .",
    "a standard approach to describe this effective loss of information in an isolated system is _ coarse graining_. by averaging over finite regions of phase space , information is lost , and thus entropy is produced .",
    "often , coarse graining is discussed in connection with measurements performed on a system . however , in section 2 we will discuss how even in the absence of physical measurements the uncertainty principle implies a natural , measurement independent coarse graining .",
    "it thus implies effective entropy production for nonlinear , time - reversal invariant systems , in which individual trajectories approach all points in some region of phase space , while all ensembles of trajectories respect liouville s theorem , i.e. occupy a constant phase space volume .",
    "this argument also applies to the information residing in the phases between the different components of a quantum system , which are smeared by coarse graining .",
    "thus decoherence or de - phasing plays a crucial role for the discussion of thermalization and entropy production , which naturally leads to the question whether decoherence alone is sufficient to reach thermalization .",
    "this is not the case , because decoherence may lead to systems with statistical features , which have energy and momentum distributions that are far from equilibrium .",
    "heavy - ion collisions provide a good example for such systems .",
    "after decoherence of the initial parton distributions in the colliding nuclei one is left with some sort of quark - gluon matter that can , for most part , be treated statistically and semi - classically . the natural question is whether the equations of fluid dynamics can be applied to describe the subsequent evolution of this matter .",
    "fluid dynamics is an effective theory for the time evolution of the expectation value of the components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 , which encodes the dynamics of the system in terms of macroscopic quantities : energy density , pressure , collective flow velocity , and the equation of state .",
    "its applicability requires that spatial and temporal gradients of these quantities are small , and that the deviations of the microscopic statistical state of the system from local thermal equilibrium are small and can be represented by viscous ( gradient ) corrections describing anisotropies of the stress tensor .",
    "the early - time energy momentum tensor for heavy - ion collisions ( colliding along the @xmath3 axis ) obtained by solving the classical yang - mills equations of motion has the approximate form@xcite @xmath4 with negative longitudinal pressure , which makes it unsuitable for hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "the negative longitudinal pressure is an expression of the fact that gauss law does not permit all components of the gauge field to decohere , because they are not independent of the field generating color charges . in this case",
    ", secondary gluon production depletes the remaining coherent longitudinal fields and eventually generates positive longitudinal pressure",
    ". only then can the system establish acceptable initial conditions for the following hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "the particle production process and the interaction among the produced particles therefore must be included in the description of the thermalization process .",
    "a natural question to ask in this situation is , how quickly the components of the stress tensor develop a sufficient degree of isotropy in the locally co - moving frame for a hydrodynamical description to be valid , and how this _ isotropization time _",
    ", @xmath5 , compares to the _ decoherence time _ ,",
    "note that isotropization is a less stringent requirement than thermal equilibration . in principle",
    ", an isotropic stress tensor could be generated by an isotropic , yet strongly non - thermal gluon distribution .",
    "indeed , if one considers a dilute ensemble of de - phased particles , which is described by the boltzmann equation , in a state near thermal equilibrium , its relaxation to equilibrium is governed by an infinite set of relaxation times and their associated modes .",
    "because of the local conservation of energy and momentum , the viscous modes are usually those which survive at late times , and thus entropy growth at late time is usually controlled by the viscosities and the thermal conductivity .",
    "but this does not have to be the case when the system is far off equilibrium , where unstable , exponentially growing modes may exist that do not permit a linearized description .",
    "such processes can somtimes be interpreted as run - away ( stimulated ) particle production .",
    "while particle production is usually not interpreted as decoherence , it may in fact be related to it .",
    "for example , bremsstrahlung can be understood as decoherence of the coherent , quasi - real weizscker - williams fields associated with any fast moving charge .",
    "while such radiation does not result in exponential growth in qed in the vacuum , it can do so in the presence of strong fields ( e.g.  in a free electron laser ) or in the nonlinear dynamics of an electromagnetic plasma or a quark - gluon plasma far off equilibrium .",
    "the interpretation of how entropy is generated in such processes may then depend on the theoretical and conceptual framework in which the processes that lead to thermalization are described .",
    "the question of whether , how , and how fast a highly excited state of qcd matter equilibrates thermally is thus a multi - faceted one , and we certainly do not profess to fully understand all relevant points of view .",
    "below , we will outline and discuss those we are aware of , without claiming completeness . a general framework for",
    "the study of thermalization processes starts from the observation that thermal equilibrium corresponds to the state of highest entropy .",
    "our approach thus focuses on the rate at which entropy is produced in the system .",
    "as already mentioned , the von neumann entropy of an isolated quantum system never increases , because the time evolution of an isolated quantum state is unitary .",
    "however , when we speak of the thermalization of an isolated system , we mean that its state `` looks '' thermal to most practically feasible experiments that measure a select number of observables . owing to the lack of complete observation we replace the microscopic , possibly pure quantum state of the system by a density matrix that traces over all unmeasured observables . by this coarse graining procedure",
    "we assign an entropy to the system , which can grow as a function of time if the microscopic structure of the quantum state gets hidden in more and more complex , and hence practically unobservable , degrees of freedom .",
    "the coarse grained , apparent entropy is then a measure of the complexity of the microscopic state of the system .",
    "the generic time evolution of the coarse grained entropy for a dynamical system with ergodic properties is sketched in fig.[fig : as1 ] . at very early times ,",
    "the behavior is extremely sensitive to details of the initial state and will depend on the initial phase correlations and the occupation probabilities of the various eigenmodes of the system . if all modes are randomly occupied the length of this period can be estimated@xcite to be of order @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of independent modes .",
    "the period of approximately linear rise of the coarse grained entropy is governed by the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents of the system in the classical limit , the so - called kolmogorov - sina ( ks ) entropy growth rate . the rise starts when the amplitude of the unstable modes has outgrown the average mode occupation , and it terminates when the coarse grained entropy approaches the equilibrium entropy . while the rate of growth of the entropy is an intrinsic property of the system , the total duration of the quasi - linear period depends on the specific nature of the initial state .",
    "finally , the last phase is governed by the relaxation times of small deviations from equilibrium .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the quark - gluon plasma created in a relativistic heavy ion collision is commonly described by relativistic viscous hydrodynamics , which is well suited to describe the last , asymptotic phase sketched in fig.[fig : as1 ] . obviously , the question , when the transition from the microscopic description to the hydrodynamical one should be taken , has no unique answer but has to be decided on the basis of heuristic and practical considerations . in principle , the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic simulation will depend on which moment is chosen as the starting time .",
    "however , if hydrodynamics applies at all , the late time results of the simulation will depend only little on when exactly the transition from a microscopic description to hydrodynamics is made . according to our discussion ,",
    "the only constraint is that this time should be chosen close to the end of the phase of linear entropy growth .",
    "in fact , the situation is even more involved . in practice",
    ", the information about the supposedly thermal character of the final state is obtained from single - particle observables , including emitted particle yields , spectra , and angular distributions , as well as of selected two - particle correlation functions , such as balance functions .",
    "these observables are all of hadronic nature ; thus , one also has to take into account the entropy production which occurs during hadronization , as well as that caused by interactions in the expanding hadron gas before freeze - out .",
    "these final one - particle or limited two - particle observables trace over a very large number of degrees of freedom and thus imply a highly coarse grained description in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "however , we are not so much interested in this late state as in the question when the transition to a hydrodynamical description is justified early in the reaction . for this question , a coarse grained entropy definition that is dictated by the exigencies of final - state measurements ,",
    "long after the collision is over , makes little sense , because a thus defined entropy may have very little relevance for the dynamics governing the time evolution of the system .",
    "this suggests that it may be useful to study entropy growth under a _",
    "minimal _ amount of coarse graining ( as imposed by the uncertainty principle , see below ) and to use this approach to estimate the rate at which the coarse grained entropy approaches its thermal equilibrium value .",
    "the different conceptual approaches to the thermalization problem are to some extent complementary .",
    "obviously , when the system truly equilibrates , all approaches will indicate thermalization .",
    "however , isotropy of its macroscopic properties alone is a poor measure of thermal equilibrium of a quantum system , nor does the growth of the coarse grained entropy ensure that the system approaches local isotropy .",
    "a fluid dynamical description with a thermal equation of state requires both . in this review ,",
    "we focus on the progress of our understanding of how and when the apparent entropy in the final state of a relativistic heavy ion collision is generated by the internal dynamics of the highly excited qcd matter .",
    "however , we caution the reader that , while substantial progress has been made over the last years , we are still far from having a complete answer to the problem of thermalization .",
    "as already mentioned , much of our information on the behavior and properties of hot qcd matter is derived from measurements of the particle yields and spectra in the final state of relativistic heavy ion collisions and their interpretation in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic concepts . at the energies available at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "one of the most relevant quantities is the azimuthal quadrupole anisotropy of the collective flow , usually called _",
    "elliptic flow _ and denoted as @xmath9 .",
    "an excellent agreement of hydrodynamical calculations of the flow anisotropy of the matter produced in the nuclear collisions with the elliptic flow measurements requires the assumption of a rapid thermal equilibration of the matter on a time scale of the order of 1 fm / c .",
    "an important problem in the description of relativistic heavy ion reactions is thus to understand how the produced matter equilibrates so quickly , _",
    "i.e. _ , when and how entropy is created in the reaction . in principle , one can distinguish five different stages of entropy production :    1 .",
    "decoherence of the initial nuclear wave functions ; 2 .",
    "thermalization of the partonic plasma ( `` glasma '' ) ; 3 .",
    "dissipation due to shear viscosity in the hydrodynamical expansion ; 4 .",
    "hadronization accompanied by large bulk viscosity ; 5 .",
    "viscous hadronic freeze - out .",
    "indicate the entropy per unit rapidity reached at the end of various collision stages based on experimental data and model estimates.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    our present incomplete knowledge about the contribution of these different stages to the final entropy is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bm1 ] . before we discuss these stages in turn",
    ", we note that the final entropy per unit rapidity @xmath10 is one of the best known quantities in relativistic heavy ion physics . in the case of au+au collisions at rhic",
    "the entropy distribution @xmath10 at particle freeze - out can be determined from an analysis of the final hadron spectra in combination with the information on the source radius derived from identical particle ( hbt ) correlations.@xcite   the slightly extrapolated result for the 6% most central au+au collisions at @xmath11 gev is @xmath12 at midrapidity.@xcite  alternatively , the final entropy can be deduced from the measured hadron abundances , combined with the calculated entropy per particle for a hadron gas in chemical equilibrium at @xmath13 mev , @xmath14 , which yields the result@xcite  @xmath15 .",
    "the 10 percent difference between these values can be attributed to the entropy production during the hadronic freeze - out and reflects the entropy production due to the decay of excited hadronic resonance states as well as the contribution from the substantial shear viscosity of a thermal hadron gas.@xcite      entropy production by decoherence dominates the very first stage of a heavy ion collision .",
    "the loss of coherence is measured by the decay of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath16 describing the system .",
    "a practical way of investigating this process is to calculate the decay rate of the quantity @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the time scale of the decoherence of the initial nuclear wave function has been studied by this method in the color glass condensate model ( cgc).@xcite  in this model , the initial nuclear gluon distributions are coherent over a wide range of longitudinal momenta @xmath18 ( in the beam direction ) due to the high degree of lorentz contraction of the fast moving nuclei . the elementary process driving the decay of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix is the fusion of one gluon from each nucleus , which removes gluons from the initial - state wave functions . the relevant time scale in this process",
    "is set by the saturation scale @xmath19 of the nuclear gluon distribution .",
    "@xmath19 is a measure of the average transverse momentum of gluons in a fast moving nucleus .",
    "gluons with transverse momentum @xmath20 gev can be thought of as components of a quasi - classical gauge field .",
    "a careful analysis yields the result that the characteristic decoherence time is @xmath21 , where @xmath1 denotes a calculable constant close to unity.@xcite  while this result is expected on dimensional grounds , the fact that @xmath22 is important because it shows that decoherence occurs over a time of less than 0.2 fm / c .    here",
    "we do not want to present the complete chain of arguments leading to this result , but only provide a few details showing how the cgc model enters into the calculation .",
    "we study perturbative gluon interactions between the gluons in a nucleus at rest ( nucleus 1 ) and a fast moving one ( nucleus 2 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix describing nucleus 1 reads @xcite @xmath23 the cgc model enters by specifying the correlator @xmath24 between gauge fields in nucleus 2 as @xmath25 where @xmath26",
    "this form implies decoherence in transverse momentum but coherence in longitudinal momentum . for the gluon field correlator in nucleus 1 ( at rest ) one makes a simple gaussian ansatz @xmath27 it turns out that a finite result is only obtained if the following running of the qcd coupling constant is used@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the infrared cutoff of the cgc , which cancels in the ratio @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this ratio then turns out to be inversely proportional to the life - time of the system , and one can define @xmath6 as the time after which this ratio has dropped by a factor @xmath30 .",

    "the time evolution of the coarse grained entropy should therefore be approximately given by the following expression : @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes an energy band of width @xmath101 and @xmath102 as time progresses , @xmath101 continues to shrink , until it is eventually smaller than any spacing between energy eigenvalues of the system .",

    "the relationship @xmath148 implies that the entropy can only depend on the area of the common surface separating @xmath140 from @xmath141 , which we call @xmath149 .",

    "entanglement entropy thus contains by construction the holographic principle , making it one of the primary objects of interest for the thermodynamic properties of event horizons .",
    "the entanglement entropy was first quantitatively studied for a three - dimensional quantum field theory by srednicki , who found that the value of the entropy depends quadratically on the ultraviolet momentum cut - off of the field theory.@xcite  the concept trivially generalizes to spatial dimensions other than @xmath152 .",
    "the one - dimensional case has been extensively studied for conformal field theories.@xcite   in that case , the entanglement entropy of an interval of length @xmath153 in the vacuum state of the field theory is given , up to a possible constant , by the general formula@xcite @xmath154 where @xmath1 denotes the central charge of the conformal field theory and @xmath131 is the short - distance cut - off .",
    "for this simple case , the analogue to the apparent conflict in three dimensions between the volume dependence of thermal entropy and surface dependence of entanglement entropy can be resolved as follows . when the field is not in its vacuum state but in thermal equilibrium at @xmath155 , then @xmath146 measures not only the entanglement entropy with the surroundings of domain @xmath140 , but also the thermal entropy contained in @xmath140 .",
    "as expected , the thermal contribution is proportional to the volume of @xmath140 ( in one dimension simply the length @xmath153 of the interval ) .",

    "when the original vacuum state is perturbed by a quantum quench , the entanglement entropy increases with time and eventually reaches the thermal value . in the limit of a near critical one - dimensional conformal field theory on an interval of length @xmath153 one finds@xcite @xmath160 where @xmath63 is the so - called extrapolation length .",
    "the final entropy corresponds to the temperature @xmath161 remarkably , the entanglement entropy reaches its equilibrium value after a finite time @xmath162 , which implies that the entangled information travels away from the center of the interval at the speed of light .",
    "the concept of entanglement entropy has an important application to black holes . in the theoretical investigation of the properties of black holes",
    "it was realized early on that thermodynamic consistency requires black holes to have some form of entropy , which was suggested by bekenstein@xcite  to be proportional to its surface @xmath163 . the relation @xmath164 , which holds when some object falls into the black hole , requires black holes to have a nonzero temperature , e.  g.   @xmath165 for a schwarzschild black hole , which is exactly the hawking temperature . that the latter is of quantum origin ( notwithstanding the fact that some of its properties can be derived from thermodynamics ) underlines the fact that entropy can not be formulated consistently in a classical theory , as usually discussed in connection with the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "equating statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy implies that the number of quantum states must be proportional to @xmath166 .",
    "this relation implies that all information contained in a black hole is encoded in the area of its horizon , which is a special case of the holographic principle.@xcite   the latter states that the number of degrees of freedom @xmath8 , understood as the number of independent quantum states describing a region @xmath140 of space - time is bounded by the area @xmath167 of its boundary.@xcite   many detailed investigations suggest that this definition may , indeed , avoid all apparent paradoxes of information flow across an event horizon that have been constructed over the years .    for our discussion ,",
    "two aspects are worth highlighting :    * the surface entropy of a horizon can be identified , up to a constant factor , with the _ entanglement entropy_. * there exists a fundamental difference between a static black hole and a dynamically created and evaporating one , as the entanglement entropy ( which is often identified with the von neumann entropy ) can remain zero for the latter .",
    "thus the unitarity of the boundary gauge field theory might find its counterpart in in the unitarity of the black hole formation and evaporation process , see e.  g.  takayanagi and ugajin.@xcite    there is a growing consensus that the formation and evaporation of a black hole is a unitary process , at least in asymptotically flat or ads space - times.@xcite this implies that the von neumann entropy stays constant throughout the process and information about the initial state can , in principle , be recovered from careful measurements of correlations within the hawking radiation.@xcite the apparent ( bekenstein ) entropy assigned to a black hole is an expression of the inability of a classical observer to distinguish between the many micro - states of the true quantum geometry . in the `` fuzzball '' picture@xcite  of the black hole ,",
    "the horizon encloses the region in which the average micro - state deviates strongly from the classical geometry .",
    "the finite size of the fuzzball is set by the uncertainty relation , which dictates that a micro - state carrying enough energy to represent the mass of the black hole will , in general , be spread out in space .",
    "one can easily imagine that a phase space smearing of a micro - state , similar to the husimi transform of the wigner function , would map the the pure state of the quantum geometry into the entropy carrying , quasi - thermal geometry of a classical black hole .",
    "the bekenstein entropy would then have to be understood as the coarse grained entropy for a transitory black hole created by gravitational collapse as well as the entanglement entropy of an eternal black hole .",
    "takayanagi and ugajin@xcite  have argued that under certain circumstances the entanglement entropy of a transient black hole can remain zero .",
    "this could happen , e.g. , if the forming and decaying black hole is microscopic so that it decays into a small number of excitations whose detailed phase relationship can be observed .",
    "they construct a toy model in which `` black hole '' formation is a periodic process , which obviously does not entail entropy growth .",
    "this is a special case of the general observation that the concept of entropy for a finite system only makes sense on time scales much shorter than the poincar recurrence time .",
    "while this is practically true for most systems with many degrees of freedom , it does not apply to microscopic systems , and it may not apply to simplified systems that have been constructed to be mathematically tractable .",
    "we also note that the von neumann entropy of an eternal black hole may be non - zero .",
    "the fundamental difference between a stationary and a transitory black hole with respect to their entanglement entropy is illustrated in fig.[fig : entangle_1 ] . before the black hole",
    "is formed , @xmath140 and @xmath141 cover the full quantum system @xmath142 .",
    "thus entanglement entropy can be defined as the minimal surface between @xmath140 and @xmath141 . if a black hole develops inside of @xmath141 this minimal surface does not change at all ( case @xmath168 ) . as",
    "the process is unitary , @xmath141 undergoes some non - trivial internal reordering of states , but this does not affect the surface between @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",

    "the field theory can be considered as `` living '' on the asymptotic boundary of the ads@xmath176 space - time ; the ads@xmath176 space - time is therefore usually referred to as the `` bulk '' .",

    "empty anti - desitter space corresponds to the vacuum state of the field theory .",
    "thermalization of the theory is thus dual to the process of black hole formation in the bulk .",
    "the energy deposition occurring in a heavy ion collision corresponds to the injection of energy in the outer regions of the bulk , which then falls by gravitational attraction and eventually forms a black hole , providing a holographic description of the process of thermalization in the gauge theory .    in recent years",
    "it has been understood that ads / cft duality makes it possible to obtain rigorous predictions for strongly coupled gauge theories at high temperature which seem to agree with phenomenological results deduced from high - energy heavy - ion collision data.@xcite   however , it is important to keep in mind that qcd is not a strongly coupled theory in the high temperature limit , where it becomes approximately conformal .",
    "on the other hand , in the temperature range of practical interest ( @xmath183 500 mev ) where thermal qcd is a strongly coupled theory , it is far from being conformally invariant .",

    "the problem of thermalization of highly excited states in quantum chromodynamics and gravity has been intensively studied during the past decade . in qcd , the interest was driven by the experimental results from relativistic heavy ion collisions , which indicated that a thermal quark - gluon plasma is formed on an extremely short time scale of order 1 fm/@xmath1 . in gravity theories ,",
    "the main motivation was the desire to resolve the information paradox associated with black hole formation . in both situations",
    ", the question can be phrased in terms of the growth rate of an appropriately defined entropy . while the von neumann entropy of a closed system does not change with time in any quantum theory due to the unitarity of the time evolution , other measures of entropy , which take into account",
    "the principal or practical inability of an observer to measure all details of a system , can grow with time and eventually approach the thermal equilibrium value .    in this review , we covered several different definitions of such a coarse grained entropy with broad applicability : husimi s phase - space smearing of the wigner distribution , de - phasing of the quantum state underlying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis , and entanglement entropy applied to holographic duals of the quantum system .",
    "we showed that de - phasing and husimi smearing result in the same entropy growth rate in the case of a single unstable mode , which was equal to the ks entropy describing the growth rate of the coarse grained entropy in the classical limit .",
    "this observation motivated a numerical study of the entropy growth rate of the non - abelian su(2 ) gauge theory , reviewed in section  [ subsect : su2 ] , which confirmed the rapid thermalization observed in the experiments .",
    "the concept of entanglement entropy and its holographic equivalent enables rigorous calculations of the approach to thermalization in the strongly coupled conformal supersymmetric gauge theory . in this approach ,",
    "the process of thermalization is dual to the formation of a black hole , linking the study of thermalization in the @xmath213dimensional gauge theory to the study of black hole formation in @xmath214dimensional supergravity .",
    "the concept of entanglement entropy for a bounded region of space parallels that of the husimi smeared entropy ( the wehrl entropy ) , because it accounts for the position uncertainty of field modes with a given momentum .",
    "the two concepts differ in that the entanglement entropy only accounts for the uncertainty relation smearing of field modes near the boundary , while the wehrl entropy implements the uncertainty smearing of all field modes .",
    "the holographic duality also provides compelling evidence for the view that the formation and subsequent evaporation of a black hole must be a unitary process in a quantum theory of gravity , which does not result in an increase of the von neumann entropy , but is accompanied by a maximal increase in an appropriately defined coarse grained entropy .    notwithstanding these significant theoretical advances ,",
    "there remain many unresolved questions .",
    "how exactly are the different notions of coarse grained entropy connected ?",
    "when does black hole formation and decay result in an increase in the coarse grained entropy , and when does it represent a practically reversible process as in the toy model constructed by takayanagi and ugajin?@xcite  how do the same concepts apply to the cosmic big bang ?",
