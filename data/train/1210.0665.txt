    "one of the most fascinating perspectives offered by nanomechanical devices is the creation of entanglement in systems exhibiting macroscopic length scales .",
    "the quest for observing such genuine quantum effects in macroscopic physical systems is not only motivated by fundamental considerations , relating to long - standing questions of the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "but in fact , several applications for quantum technologies are readily conceivable : mechanical systems may be used in quantum metrology and high - precision measurement , and possibly even in quantum interfaces for architectures of quantum information processing . indeed , only within the last few years , the experimental study of nanoelectromechanical @xcite and optomechanical @xcite systems close to the quantum regime has seen significant successes , one of the latest experimental achievements constituting the cooling of a nanomechanical resonator to close to its ground state @xcite . still , the benchmark of achieving entanglement , from which a number of exciting developments would follow , has not quite been reached yet , neither in the nanoelectromechanical nor in the optomechanical setting .    on the theoretical side , to devise feasible proposals for entanglement generation in nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) has been a goal for many years . in the pioneering work of ref .  , a route towards entanglement in nems was proposed making use of a global nonadiabatic change of the interaction strength in a one - dimensional chain of nanomechanical oscillators .",
    "most recent proposals focus rather on optomechanical settings . here , the generation of entanglement between a movable mirror and a cavity @xcite or with another mirror @xcite ( mediated by cavity modes ) has been studied .",
    "other proposals consider entanglement with a collective spin ensemble of an atomic medium @xcite or a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "the aim is in any of these proposals to detect the generation of macroscopic entanglement ( as is already routinely experimentally observed in quantum optical systems of atoms and photons or collective spin ensembles ) ; still , for technological reasons , it remains a challenging task .",
    "our aim is to generate entanglement between two spatially separated nanomechanical oscillators via open systems dynamics moderated by a shared bath . on an abstract level ,",
    "several such settings have been studied so far , mainly considering couplings to bosonic baths @xcite . to uplift such suggestions to feasible schemes , however , one has to acknowledge the obstacle that in order to achieve entanglement , bath coherence times have to be long . additionally , even more crucial challenges have to be overcome : in spatially separated tunneling processes , only very little which - path information may be acquired , if entanglement is not to be largely destructed .",
    "this is a generic fundamental issue in all systems separated on macroscopic length scales and coupled by true multimode quantum baths ( which is in sharp contrast with optical setups , where , say , several atoms can easily couple to the same optical field mode of a cavity ) .",
    "we solve this problem by suggesting an entirely new mechanism for entanglement generation between nanoelectromechanical oscillators : we resort to an andreev entangler setup which is characterized by the manifest absence of which - path information in a certain parameter regime , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2oscsetups](b ) .",
    "this is reached by using a dynamical instance of a coulomb blockage and employing the protection against uncorrelated quasiparticle tunneling offered by the superconducting gap . for a split cooper pair",
    ", the electrons are found to tunnel separately into different leads . due to electron - phonon coupling , this process of cooper - pair tunneling effectively generates robust entanglement between the bosonic mechanical modes .",
    "hence , our proposal only relies on the coherence of a superconducting condensate , exhibiting much longer coherence lengths than normal metal systems .",
    "we quantify this entanglement as it evolves in time under markovian @xcite and non - markovian @xcite dynamics .",
    "it has increasingly become clear in recent years that dissipation is not necessarily always detrimental for the generation of entanglement or coherent dynamics @xcite .",
    "for such an idea to work for tunneling processes in the condensed - matter context , the above mentioned challenges have to be overcome , however . in this work",

    "section  [ sec : four ] is devoted to the heart of our article , setup ( b ) , which introduces a new mechanism , relying on the physics of an andreev entangler to generate entanglement between the two nanomechanical oscillators via correlated fermion tunneling .",

    "for simplicity , we later assume two identical oscillators , i.e. , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , but this assumption is not crucial for the generation of entanglement in our setup .",
    "the coupling between the system and the bath is defined by @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig:2oscsetups ] depicts two settings , setup ( a )  which may be seen as a paradigmatic setup coupling two modes via a shared fermionic bath  and setup ( b ) , which constitutes the andreev entangler setup in the focus of this work .",
    "our goal is to investigate the time evolution of entanglement between two nanomechanical oscillators . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the two most used entanglement measures , the entanglement of formation @xmath11 @xcite as well as the ( logarithmic ) negativity @xmath12 @xcite ; both are equipped with an operational interpretation .",

    "the system - bath coupling is meditated via the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath25 where for small oscillation amplitudes we approximate the tunneling matrix elements as being linear in the oscillator displacement , and for the sake of simplicity assume all tunneling amplitudes ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) to be real and take the coupling to be symmetric .",

    "( [ eqn : nemsent8 ] ) , we also neglect the momentum dependence of the tunneling amplitudes . therefore ,",
    "which - path information is effectively discarded at the hamiltonian level , meaning that after the tunneling from the left reservoir to the right one , there is no information included in the model on the oscillator that was involved in the tunneling process . for a setup of finite size  like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2oscsetups]a  this is a rather strong approximation since the geometry , especially the fact that the right reservoir is of mesoscopic size , is not taken into account at all .",
    "this strong assumption is however weakened when we introduce setup ( b ) below . in order to include non - markovian effects of the fermionic reservoirs properly",

    "( [ eqn : supm6 ] ) will come from the energies close to the fermi level of each lead .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to the regime of low applied bias voltages ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this is just a simplification in order to keep the number of parameters in the problem as low as possible . with these assumptions ,",
    "the energy - dependent spectral function can be approximated as @xmath49 physically , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : supm7 ] ) implies that an electron with energy @xmath28 in the left lead can tunnel into states of the right lead with energy @xmath29 , broadened by @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "let us briefly interpret the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath30 . on the one hand , the limit @xmath50 corresponds to a resonant tunneling process with narrow densities of states in the leads .",
    "on the other hand , the so - called wide - band limit is reached in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "this limit results in an energy - independent density of states in the leads .",
    "thus , in that latter case , any electron from the left lead can tunnel into the right lead . in nature",
    ", a realistic form of the density of states depends on the details and can in many situations not be described by our model with a single parameter @xmath52 .",
    "however , this model nicely allows us to extrapolate between two extreme cases .",
    "therefore , we can better understand qualitative aspects of the role of the density of states in the leads for the generation of entanglement .    with the spectral function in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : supm7 ] ) , the time - dependent kernels @xmath53 and @xmath54 can now be calculated analytically , but the resulting expressions are too lengthy to be stated here .",
    "we now investigate the system s dynamics , where we take , for simplicity , the idealized vacuum state as an initial state , which is a gaussian state .",
    "we first discuss the case of zero electronic temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comf3 ] we show the logarithmic negativity for @xmath55 and its dependence on @xmath30 for setup ( a ) .",
    "we clearly see that the initially separable state becomes entangled right after the interactions have been suddenly switched on .",
    "this effect of the sudden quench leading to a nonequilibrium situation is similar to the nonadiabatic change of the interaction strength in ref .  , but here mediated via a shared bath .",
    "experimentally , the switching in this tunneling setup can be achieved by gates controlling the tunnel coupling via a resonance .",
    "physically this means that the rise time of the gates has to be shorter than @xmath56 , the timescale of the oscillators .",
    "typical rise times of electronic gates can be as short as @xmath57 @xcite . for an oscillator with a resonance frequency of @xmath58 ( which can in principle be brought into its ground state at low temperatures ) these rise times are sufficient to accomplish the sudden switching . in its subsequent evolution ,",
    "the entanglement oscillates in time , before it slowly decays .",
    "we further find that low bias voltages show an increased logarithmic negativity compared to high bias voltages .",
    "a significant challenge in the idealized setup ( a ) is the assumption of long coherence times of the reservoirs . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we now introduce an alternative realization based on a superconducting reservoir in the center and two independent normal - metal reservoirs which nonetheless is capable of generating entanglement .",
    "this realization , setup ( b ) , is of an andreev entangler type .    in its original sense ,",
    "an andreev entangler @xcite relies on the splitting of a cooper pair which is a spin singlet .",
    "there , the split cooper pair stemming from an @xmath59-wave superconductor can coherently tunnel via two different quantum dots into different leads . throughout this process , the spin singlet is preserved and therefore the andreev entangler is capable of generating nonlocal spin - entangled electrons .    in our context of nems , we use only charge properties of the split cooper pair as a mediator for an effective coupling between the oscillators .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2oscsetups](b ) what such an andreev entangler setup could look like .",
    "a superconducting island ( orange ) serves as a source of cooper pairs which can tunnel onto two different ( conducting ) nanomechanical oscillators .",
    "the process where the cooper pair is split and one electron tunnels to the lower oscillator and the other one tunnels to the upper oscillator gives rise to an effective coupling between them .",
    "the major improvements of setup ( b ) over setup ( a ) are ( i ) the right common reservoir of setup ( a ) is now cut into two halves ; the resulting two normal - metal leads are entirely _ independent _",
    "( i.e. , we circumvent the assumption of macroscopic coherence in the metallic reservoirs ) ; ( ii ) both normal - metal leads see the same tunneling processes ( therefore their independence does not result in which - path information ) @xcite ; ( iii ) phase coherence lengths of superconductors are typically much longer than of normal metals [ this allows for a larger ( than pointlike ) spatial extent of the center reservoir ] . processes where one cooper pair tunnels to the upper / lower lead are not taken into account since they do not lead to any entanglement , but rather to a background tunneling current .",
    "such processes are also energetically not favorable due to interaction effects in the leads and/or tunneling via a dot with a finite charging energy @xcite .",
    "another possibility to favor the mentioned tunneling process is to couple the superconductor to two luttinger liquid leads @xcite . in nems",
    "this could be achieved by modeling the oscillators as one - dimensional nanowires or carbon nanotubes .",
    "we briefly want to mention that all the ingredients needed for setup ( b ) have already been separately realized in recent experiments . in the last years",
    ", there have been successful experimental realizations of a cooper - pair splitter @xcite where in one of the experiments carbon nanotubes were already implemented as the medium to favor the tunneling of a split cooper pair .",
    "suspended carbon nanotubes have also been achieved by different experimental groups worldwide . in particular , they have been studied in the context of the franck - condon blockade where a mechanical mode of the suspended nanotube couples to the electron occupation number of a quantum dot that forms on the carbon nanotube @xcite .",
    "putting these two ingredients together would already allow for a first experimental test of our proposed andreev entangler for nanoelectromechanical oscillators .      in the case of setup ( b )",
    ", the bath consists of three independent reservoirs , two normal - metal leads , and a central superconducting region .",
    "the bath hamiltonian becomes @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "we conclude that it is possible to significantly entangle two nanomechanical resonators which are coupled to three independent reservoirs within an andreev entangler setup , following non - markovian open system dynamics in nonequilibrium .",
    "next , we discuss the influence of finite temperature on the entanglement .",
    "a non - zero temperature will render the generation of entanglement more challenging , but the scheme is rather robust with respect to such thermal effects .",
    "a finite electronic temperature can be included by taking a finite value for the inverse temperature @xmath85 in the fermi distribution function .",
    "more importantly , the effects of the non - zero temperature of the substrate to which the oscillators are clamped can be included by means of additional terms to the master equation .",
    "this coupling can be modelled by a caldeira - leggett - type coupling @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , where each nanomechanical oscillator couples to an independent phononic heat bath ( described by the position operator @xmath88 ) .",
    "the couplings @xmath89 define the spectral function or density in the continuum limit . this problem can be solved exactly @xcite . however , to an extraordinarily good approximation , a very weak coupling of this form can be captured by a markovian master equation . for low mechanical quality factors ,",
    "deviations from ohmic spectral densities and non - markovian effects may become relevant ; yet , this is not the limit we are interested in here , but rather the limit of large mechanical quality factors and weak damping .",
    "we can hence well approximate the dynamics by appending the following terms to the master equation : @xmath90 [ a_n \\rho_s(t )   a_n^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\ { a_n^\\dagger   a_n,\\rho_s(t)\\right\\ } ] { \\nonumber}\\\\      & + \\gamma_{{\\textrm}{bos } } \\sum_{n=1,2 } \\bar n(\\beta_{{\\textrm}{bos } } )     [ a_n^\\dagger   \\rho_s(t )   a_n   - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\{a_n   a_n^\\dagger,\\rho_s(t)\\right\\ } ] { \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some @xmath91 reflecting the coupling strength , where @xmath92 and for simplicity @xmath93 .",

    "both are entanglement monotones , which means that they satisfy the conditions a meaningful measure of entanglement should satisfy .",
    "the logarithmic negativity is defined for states @xmath133 as @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the partial transpose of the state with respect to one part of the system .",
    "the trace - norm @xmath136 is defined as @xmath137 for operators @xmath138 .",
    "the entanglement of formation in turn is the convex hull of the reduced entropy function .",
    "that is to say , it is given by the infimum over all pure - state decompositions @xmath139 where @xmath34 is the von - neumann entropy of the reduced state of one part .",
    "for gaussian bipartite states of two modes , as they are encountered in several instances of the main text , there is a simple way to compute both of these quantities . if @xmath140 is the covariance matrix of the state @xmath141 , the covariance matrix of @xmath135 is given by @xmath142 , where @xmath143 .",
    "the trace norm of the partial transpose can readily be computed from the symplectic eigenvalues @xmath144 of @xmath145 , @xmath146 being the smaller one . in this way , one arrives at the expression @xmath147 the form obtained is specifically simple for symmetric gaussian states with covariance matrices of the form @xmath148 with real entries @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , as they are encountered in particular in setup ( a ) of the main text . then @xmath151 at the same time , the more directly detectable so - called epr uncertainty , for states with vanishing first moments defined as @xmath152 is found to be the same expression , @xmath153 this basic insight can be used in order to tackle the challenging issue of detection , when the epr uncertainty can be detected by means of two phase - sensitive joint measurements of the two oscillators .",
    "it turns out that for gaussian states with that high degree of symmetry , the entanglement of formation is again given by the same quantity , up to a rescaling : one finds that @xcite @xmath154 here the convex and monotone decreasing function @xmath155 is defined as @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "so for such symmetric gaussian states , the epr uncertainty is the only relevant quantity determining both the ( logarithmic ) negativity and the entanglement of formation . for any of the encountered states in setup ( b )",
    ", the negativity can still be computed .",
    "in the idealized markovian regime of setup ( b ) at zero temperature , the liouvillian governing the dynamics will decompose into a direct sum of terms reflecting different excitation numbers , and the single lindblad operator @xmath103 can be written as @xmath158 if initially a finite number of excitations is present , the time - evolved state will only occupy a certain finite subspace as well . what is more , for",
    "large classes of initial states , the value of any entanglement monotone can readily be given , without having to compute the actual expression .",
    "for example , for the initial state @xmath159 in the absence of decoherence reflecting a finite temperature , states at later times will be of the form @xmath160 with suitable real time - dependent prefactors @xmath161 and @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "the two subspaces corresponding to the two terms can be locally distinguished .",
    "what is more , the state in the second term @xmath164 is maximally entangled . from the monotonicity property of the negativity and its convexity",
    ", one can therefore conclude that @xmath165 must be true , and hence @xmath166 similarly , in this situation @xmath167 .",
    "the initial preparation of @xmath159 is in its own right challenging , needless to say .",
    "still , other initial states are also conceivable , while still arriving at entangled states .",
    "what is more , simple lower bounds for the degree entanglement can be identified from blocks of a certain excitation number only .",
    "for example , within the section of exactly two excitations , one finds in the decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ deco ] ) the expression @xmath168 consider , e.g. , the situation of one mode being prepared in a thermal state of excitation number @xmath169 , the other in the ground state @xmath170 . the expected excitation number @xmath171 defines @xmath172 according to @xmath173 writing the state @xmath174 again as direct sum @xmath175 one immediately finds that for the above initial condition and within the subspace of two excitations , one has for @xmath176 @xmath177 an operator that has a single eigenvalue smaller than @xmath178 taking the value @xmath179 .",
    "hence , as a simple lower bound , one finds @xmath180 one can similarly also proceed for the entanglement of formation .",
    "this shows that also for initial states different from pure states , entanglement is created in the setting when the markovian description is largely valid . for the non - markovian description of setup ( b ) and any formulation that includes temperature , one still obtains efficiently computable expressions for the negativity .",
