    "the hole - doped cuprates have been intensively investigated because of the relatively high superconducting transition temperature and a rich phase diagram .",
    "however , the question of what causes the loss of electrical resistance in these materials is still one of the major unsolved problems in physics .",
    "we have argued that the main reason for this situation is that researchers are confused about some fundamental ideas of modern physics , for example , what is the ` hole ' ? as emphasized by hirsch @xcite , using the language of ` holes ' rather than ` electrons ' in fact obscures the essential physics since these electrons are the ones that ` undress ' and carry the supercurrent ( as electrons , not as holes ) in the superconducting state .    in our scenario model @xcite ,",
    "a hole is a real - space ` quasiparticle ' which is composed of some well - known electrons and ions . for the hole - doped cuprates ,",
    "a localized hole - pair is a cluster of two electrons ( a localized cooper pair ) , four @xmath17 and four @xmath18 inside the cu - o plane , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . according to the classical electromagnetic theory",
    ", it is very easy to prove that the direct and strong electron - electron repulsion can be entirely excluded if two electrons are aligned in @xmath16-direction [ fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) ] or @xmath19-direction [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] within each copper - oxide unit with the cooper - pair size @xmath20 ( when @xmath21 ) .",
    "more importantly , we have shown analytically and numerically that the nearest - neighbor electron-@xmath17 repulsive interactions play the key role of the ` pairing glue ' for the real - space localized cooper pair .",
    "the simply picture of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] could yield a pairing and superconducting scenario that has the potential to resolve the pseudogap and the high-@xmath6 superconducting puzzles in the hole - doped cuprates . in our series of studies",
    ", we will show that the ` hole ' pictures ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) are considered to be the most basic structural units of the hole - doped cuprates , which can further self - assemble into some superconducting electron states and non - superconducting pseudogap and checkerboard phases .",
    "all the related physical properties , such as vortex lattices , meissner effect , london penetration depth , hall effect , @xmath14-wave symmetry , checkerboard patterns , magic doping fractions , fermi pocket ( or fermi arc ) , two pseudogap behavior and rotational symmetry breaking , can be perfectly interpreted by our framework .",
    "the question remains open as to why is the superconductivity suppressed in the cuprates at the magic doping levels ? in our opinion , the suppression of superconductivity is caused by a electronic structure phase transition from a superconducting state to a localized state .",
    "it is most likely that the charge carries are pinned via coulomb interaction with their associated ions . from the perspective of symmetry breaking , the electrons in the localized state must have a higher symmetry than that of the superconducting state .",
    "two high symmetry non - superconducting wigner crystals of localized cooper pair of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are suggested and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    figs . [ fig2](a ) and ( b ) represent the tetragonal phase , where the @xmath22 checkerboard pattern can form in all doped planes [ see fig . [",
    "fig3](a ) ] .",
    "if one of @xmath9 planes in the layered superconductor are doped , thus the corresponding doping level is given by @xmath23    for the case of the octahedral phase of figs .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and ( d ) , the checkerboard shows @xmath24 structure in each doped plane [ see fig .",

    "it is easy to obtain the doping level for this phase as follows @xmath25    evidently , such commensurate stripes are unmovable and should be insulating . note from fig . [ fig2 ] that when @xmath26 , the tetragonal and octahedral phases will transit into the more stable cubic and regular octahedral phases , respectively . in the following section",
    "we will show that the perfect cubic and regular octahedral phases can be found in @xmath27 at @xmath01/8 and 1/16 , respectively .",
    "fig . [ fig3 ] shows the purely electronic description of the @xmath2 checkerboard in hole - doped @xmath28 plane , where the structural relationship between the localized hole pair ( the geometry of a cluster of two electrons , four @xmath17 and four @xmath18 ) and the localized cooper pair is clearly illustrated . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we proved analytically that the localized cooper pair is a pure nearest - neighbor confinement effect of the four nearest - neighbor @xmath17 , as indicated in fig .",
    "moreover , it has been evidently shown that a localized cooper pair is stable only when the two electrons aligned in @xmath16- or @xmath19-directions , supporting the @xmath14-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "the nearest - neighbor character of the pairing mechanism implies that the localized cooper pairs ( pseudogap ) are likely to survive in insulating or nonmetallic materials , as was reported recently by stewart @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is now well accepted that the 1/8 anomaly is always accompanied by the appearance of the @xmath2 checkerboard in the hole - doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "in fact , equations ( [ x_nsc1 ] ) and ( [ x_nsc2 ] ) imply the existence of some sort of connection between the magic doping fractions and the checkerboard patterns . according to equation ( [ x_nsc1 ] ) , when all @xmath28 planes are doped @xmath29 ) , the @xmath2 checkerboard pattern of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] may be obtained in the corresponding cuprate sample at * @xmath30*. as it is well known that the cubic phase is more stable than the tetragonal phase , thus we define the following ratio of the lattice constants @xmath31 which can be used to estimate qualitatively the stability of the checkerboard phase of different superconductors . for the three typical cuprates [ @xmath32 ( @xmath33 : @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 : @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath40 : @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) ] with the 1/8 anomaly , it is easy to get @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "obviously , these results indicate that a ` perfect ' cubic structure of the localized cooper pairs can naturally form in @xmath40 ( but not in @xmath33 and @xmath37 ) at @xmath46 , as a result , the @xmath2 checkerboard phase in @xmath40 is much more stable than that in @xmath33 and@xmath37 samples .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath2 checkerboard pattern is better detected in @xmath40 superconductor @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is immediately seen that in our framework the magic doping fractions are closely correlated with the local checkerboard patterns .",
    "based on equations ( [ x_nsc1 ] ) and ( [ x_nsc2 ] ) , one can obtain all the relevant magic doping fractions for hole - doped cuprate superconductors with the full - doped @xmath28 planes ( @xmath48 ) , as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "as we all know , the @xmath6 of hole - doped cuprates has a dome - like shape as a function of hole concentration ranged from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , under this restriction , only seven ` magic numbers ' ( @xmath01/18 , 1/16 , 2/25 , 1/9 , 1/8 , 2/9 and 1/4 ) are possible in the cuprate family",
    ". clearly , our conclusions are different from those drawn from other theories which suggest an infinite number of magic doping fractions in the superconductors @xcite .    for the tetragonal phases of @xmath01/18 , 2/25 , 1/8 and 2/9",
    ", the * @xmath1 , @xmath3 , * @xmath2 and * @xmath4 * checkerboard patterns can be easily determined from fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and equation ( [ x_nsc1 ] ) , respectively . while for the octahedral phases of @xmath01/16 , 1/9 and 1/4 , the experimental results of checkerboard structures must be @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , which are different from those proposed by fig .",
    "this is nothing to be surprised about as the checkerboard structures of the individual @xmath28 can still be described by fig .",
    "[ fig2]c . to illustrate this more explicitly ,",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath01/16 which has been experimentally confirmed to show the @xmath2 checkerboard in the lsco sample @xcite .",
    "according to our theory , the localized cooper pairs in a single doped @xmath28 plane of cuprates exhibit the @xmath51 checkerboard pattern at @xmath01/16 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in the octahedral phase ,",
    "the doped @xmath28 planes of the cuprate may be divided into ` odd doped cuo plane ' and ` even doped cuo planes ' and there is a displacement between them @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) , as indicated in fig .",
    "it can be seen clearly from the figure that though a single @xmath28 shows the @xmath51 pattern at @xmath01/16 , the results of stm experiment on this sample may still reveal the global @xmath2 structure @xcite .",
    "our results support the experimental observation that the suppression of @xmath6 and the existence of @xmath2 order in cuprates around @xmath01/8 @xcite and 1/16 @xcite . and the abnormal suppression of the superconductivity at @xmath01/9 @xcite and",
    "1/18 @xcite has also been confirmed by many researchers . in 2005 ,",
    "komiya et al .",
    "@xcite reported hole - doping dependence of the in - plane resistivity in @xmath37 samples , they find a tendency towards charge ordering at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "one may find that the results of their experiments are rough to some extent , more sophisticated experiments may reveal that the peaks of 0.06 and 0.09 are in fact double degenerate . according to our theory , the 0.06 peak corresponds to two adjacent magic doping fractions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while the 0.09 peak may be contributed by @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , in our framework , the number of 3/16 is not the magic number in cuprates .",
    "let us pay attention to the experimental results of fig .",
    "2b in komiya et al .",
    "paper @xcite , which clearly show a stronger peak around @xmath62 ( apparently different from the suggested @xmath63 ) consistent with our prediction of @xmath64 . for the largest magic number @xmath65 , the corresponding non - superconducting @xmath5 checkerboard phase is more unstable because of a much stronger pair - pair interaction inside the superconductor .",
    "consequently , the suppression of @xmath6 at @xmath01/4 can only be observed at a much lower temperature .",
    "it is worth noting that all the available experimental data of the * * ` magic numbers ' are included in our theory .",
    "however , for exactly the same question , two researcher groups @xcite have derived two totally different expressions indicating ` infinite magic numbers ' in the @xmath7-type superconductors , while at the same time some typically ` magic numbers ' ( such as 1/9 and 1/18 ) have been excluded from their expressions .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to argue that they may also be on the wrong track .",
    "broken symmetries have been detected in many hole - doped high - temperature superconductors when they undergo a phase transition @xcite .",
    "the nature of the broken symmetry in the non - superconducting pseudogap phase is a central problem in the effort to understand the pseudogap in the high-@xmath6 copper oxide superconductors .",
    "recently , it has been experimentally confirmed that the breaking of 90-rotational symmetry may occur within every @xmath28 unit cell in underdoped @xmath66 , which can be regarded as the best support for the model of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the localized hole pairs ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) are the intra - unit - cell states of the pseudogap phase with an intrinsically broken of the four - fold rotational symmetry within single @xmath28 unit cell",
    ". this apparent broken symmetry may be the key to understand the pseudogap phase of copper - oxide superconductors @xcite .",
    "similar to the liquid crystals , the significant ultra short - range anisotropic orientational structure of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] may eventually lead to the long - range orientational order in the superconductors , as shown in fig .",
    "since we assume @xmath67 , the macroscopic four - fold rotational symmetry of the checkerboard patterns of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are broken .",
    "in addition , it is not difficult to find from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that the polarized cooper pairs ( or localized hole pairs ) can self - organize into some minimum - energy quasi - one - dimensional peierls chains . for the special case of @xmath68 , the localized cooper pairs form some periodic orders ( quasi - two - dimensional vortex lattices ) of the most compact peierls chains which we considered as the superconducting ground states @xcite . by applying an external field on the superconductor along @xmath19-direction ,",
    "there is a charge ordering phase transition from the most compact peierls chains ( the superconducting ground state ) to the periodic chains ( the superconducting excited state ) with the minimum electron - electron distance @xmath69 .",
    "we have shown for the first time the intrinsic relation between the magic doping fractions and checkerboard patterns in hole - doped cuprates .",
    "it has been proved theoretically that there exist merely seven magic doping fractions numbers ( @xmath01/18 , 1/16 , 2/25 , 1/9 , 1/8 , 2/9 and 1/4 ) in the superconductors , which are completely different from those of quantum field theory , suggesting the existence of an infinite magic doping fractions in the systems . in our view , the phenomenon of the completely destruction of superconductivity is a macro - reflection of the localization of all the micro paired electrons in the superconductor .",
    "physically , the pinning of a huge amount of electrons must always accompanied by the appearance of a high symmetry localized electronic state which is characterized by a definite and periodic checkerboard pattern . for the seven magic doped samples ,",
    "all of the checkerboard structures have been uniquely determined in this study .",
    "our theoretical framework supports the new finding of the symmetries broken within one copper - oxide unit in the superconductors .",
