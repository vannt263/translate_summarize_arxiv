    "over the last 15 yr the ever increasing pace at which new , more sensitive detectors and larger telescope apertures have come online has spurred a fast and furious race to detect the most distant galaxies in the universe .",
    "emission features from hii regions ( such as ly@xmath6 ) , have been a useful tool for detecting star - forming galaxies at 3 @xmath7 6 ( corresponding to rest - frame optical wavelengths ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , at higher redshifts , corresponding to the first several hundred million years since the big bang , more and more matter was locked up in neutral hydrogen . at these early epochs the neutral intergalactic medium attenuates significant amounts of light from galaxies , including ly@xmath6 , making detection of these systems more difficult .",
    "if ly@xmath6 is significantly diminished then one must rely on the detection of a continuum break to select candidate galaxies . detecting galaxies at these redshifts places constraints on the epoch of re - ionization , thought to be at z@xmath86 @xcite .",
    "detecting and measuring the properties of these galaxies is critical to understand what caused the epoch of re - ionization .",
    "+ detecting and measuring the properties of high-@xmath0  galaxies is not easy . at rest - frame @xmath9 @xmath101216  the flux from high redshift galaxies can be completely vanquished due to the ly@xmath6  forest absorption and when observed in a filter corresponding to this wavelength the galaxy `` drops out . '' at @xmath9 @xmath8 1216  the flux is not attenuated and can be detected .",
    "such breaks become more pronounced with redshift , for example at @xmath11 5.7 a break corresponds to @xmath12 3.4 mag in color ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detection at @xmath11 8 is further complicated by the fact that the lyman regime is redshifted into near - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath9 @xmath8 1 @xmath13 ) where bright atmospheric telluric skylines and strong telluric absorption features force ground - based observations to use specific and restrictive atmospheric windows . _ large hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ based spectroscopic surveys such as grapes and pears @xcite have demonstrated the power of low resolution spectroscopy to identify high redshift sources @xcite . however , until similar large - scale programs are implemented in the near - ir using the wfc3/_hst _ or _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ , the next best method for detecting the most distant galaxies relies on using near - ir photometry obtained with _ hst_. + recently , the race to find the earliest galaxies has relied more and more on the use of the near - infrared wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) detector ( 1 @xmath10 @xmath9 @xmath10 1.6 @xmath13 ) on the _ hst _ , and in particular , broad - band imaging . detecting possible 1216  breaks with _ hst _",

    "without the direct detection of spectroscopic lines , redshift confirmations must rely on spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting .",
    "+ one of the first tools used to derive photometric redshifts was the sed fitting code hyperz which simply maximizes the likelihood by brute - force using a grid of sed templates @xcite . as noted in @xcite : `` both the _ z_@xmath15 and the sed",

    "@xcite claimed the detection of a strong balmer break between _ h - band _ and the _ spitzer _ irac1 ( 3.6 @xmath13 ) bands . simply selecting the best - fit reduced @xmath2@xmath3  model led the authors to conclude that the object was a massive early - type galaxy @xmath20 , a stark contrast to the types of systems that should exist at this epoch .",
    "their results raised serious questions regarding the viability of the @xmath21-cdm paradigm of building bigger galaxies from smaller building blocks .",

    "similarly , @xcite claimed the discovery of a lyman break galaxy at @xmath26 from nicmos/_hst _ imaging ( based on a _",

    "+ any sed fitting effort is further complicated by the assumption that model galaxy spectra constructed from our knowledge of how stars evolve in the local universe is equally applicable to the earliest epochs .",
    "one should also be cognizant of the fact that the rest - frame wavelength range sampled by a fixed set of photometric filters will span a narrower range with increasing redshift .",

    "strong statistical priors exist for only a handful of lensed galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent work from @xcite furthermore shows that there exists a population of low redshift galaxies with strong emission lines that can mimic the color - selection criteria used to select @xmath33  galaxies .",
    "the relative lack of information about high redshift galaxy candidates , as well as the low s / n of the observations produce a situation where using sound statistical methods is particularly important when trying to determine the redshifts of these objects .",
    "+ the latest claims of @xmath34 galaxies based on @xmath2@xmath3 minimization sed fitting have been presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using deep wfc3/ir images of the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) .",
    "the results from @xcite are particularly interesting since this project adds additional data ( go 12498 ; pi : ellis , hudf12 ) to the hudf09 field ( go 11563 ; pi : illingworth ) in the f105w and f160w filters as well as new observations with the f140w filter .",
    "this filter spans a wavelength range inaccessible from the ground .",
    "all but one of the sources listed in @xcite and none of the sources listed in @xcite were confirmed to be at @xmath35 using these new deeper data .",
    "the new near - infrared measurements from the hudf12 are the deepest observations available to date and for the foreseeable future . when combined with ancillary data from the hduf09 , these data allow one to construct spectral energy distributions of these sources spanning from observed _ b_-band ( acs _ f435w _ ) to irac1 and irac2 channels ( 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath13 , respectively ) .",
    "the 13 objects listed in @xcite show large red colors consistent with strong spectral breaks . while followup spectroscopic observations have only been attempted on one of the targets , udfy-38135539 @xcite and",
    "will be discussed later , the objects have all been fit using what is now considered the `` standard method '' of minimized @xmath36   sed fitting , yielding redshifts of 8 @xmath10 z @xmath10 12 . given the limitations of this method , and the numerous examples of what later turned out to be incorrect redshift identifications , we are motivated to apply more robust bayesian techniques to better constrain the physical parameters of galaxies observed using broad band filters .",
    "central to this effort is the need to derive realistic estimates of the uncertainties for each derived parameter .",
    "thus , using the sources and fluxes , including advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , wfc3 and irac , provided in @xcite , and reference therein , for 13 candidate high-@xmath0",

    "for the purpose of this paper we define low redshift to be @xmath37  and high redshift to be @xmath38 .",
    "further , we treat equally all 13 objects listed in @xcite as potential high redshift candidates to be tested with .",
    "we are not implying that  is the only viable method to perform this type of analysis .",
    "mcmc is a well established approach to this type of problem .",
    "the marginal s / n of current high redshift candidates observations warrant more robust techniques than the common @xmath36 minimization technique and the reliance on a single `` best fit '' model provided by hyper - derived sed fitting software .",
    "nominally , the `` standard method '' of minimized @xmath36  sed fitting works by matching photometric fluxes to a pre - selected grid of model templates until the residuals between model and data are minimized . however , the choice of input models , the number of parameters ( and whether any are constrained ) , parameter degeneracy and if the models sufficiently sample the entire range of the physical parameter space all affect the outcome of the fit .",
    "any and all of these issues can produce `` best - fit '' solutions that are unphysical ( i.e. a very old object in a young universe as in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "once the number of model parameters to be fit exceeds three it becomes computationally inefficient to fit parameter grid seds , more so for errors because each parameter must be refit following a pure monte carlo approach ( e.g. each parameter requires several thousand additional iterations ) .",
    "all of the most recent _ hst _ based high-@xmath0  candidate objects have relied on some modified implementation of the hyperz photometric code , or similar @xmath36  sed minimization techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while hyperz has proven to be capable for accurately constraining low-@xmath0  photometric redshifts for large numbers of sources in deep , often crowded fields later confirmed with spectroscopic followup , it was designed to estimate the _ most likely _ photometric redshift , not produce credible intervals .",
    "its treatment of the probability density functions ( pdfs ) is inadequate .",
    "based on the hyperz users manual and j .- m . miralles ( 2013 , private communication ) it minimizes over the extra dimensions ( @xmath39 ) instead of marginalizing over them , therefore the pdf returned by hyperz is given by : @xmath40    this approach does not account for the _ volume _ of the parameter space probed resulting in unreliable confidence intervals , particularly in the case of additional maxima .",
    "while such a distribution may be somewhat useful , the credible intervals produced by hyperz should not be trusted ( j .- m .",
    "miralles 2013 , private communication ) .",
    "+ in contrast , mcmc , and our implementation of it , , is a method which randomly samples the entire parameter space but does not probe the multidimensional region uniformly .",
    "the posterior probability distribution function can be constructed by simply creating a histogram of the values of a given parameter in the mcmc chain from values taken after it converges ( see section 2 in * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "just as in @xcite we quote both the 95@xmath14 and 68@xmath14 credible regions here ( see section 2.1 of @xcite for a discussion of 95@xmath14 versus 68@xmath14 credible regions , which we take to be the 95@xmath14 and 68@xmath14 highest posterior density , or hpd , regions , respectively ) . while computationally more expensive ( yet more efficient ) , our current implementation of the mcmc sed fitting code , , has three main features : + 1 . it does not depend on a pre - defined input model parameter grid and allows for a computationally efficient exploration of the input parameter space .",

    "the parameters investigated include : stellar mass ; a broad range of extinction values ( @xmath42 ) ; metallicity ( @xmath43 ) ; and stellar population ages ( limited only by the age of the universe at a given redshift ) .",
    "we adopted flat priors for these parameters .",
    "we choose flat priors as these most closely match those used by @xcite , but we allowed for larger values of extinction . using a flat prior for the redshift is a conservative choice because it does not predispose the likelihood towards low or high redshifts .",
    "a redshift prior heavily biased towards higher redshift would further reduce the likelihood of these sources to be low redshift interlopers .",
    "the application of these models has also been tested with and without the effects of nebular continuum and emission lines ( as parameterized by the escape fraction parameter ) .",
    "details regarding the application of continuum nebular emission and emission lines to  can be found in section 2.2 of @xcite .",
    "in addition to using single stellar population models ( ssp ) , the bc03 models were also tested using an exponentially decaying star formation history ( sfh ) model ( parameterized by @xmath44 ) .",
    "we use these stellar populations because we are confident that  handles them properly and we have extensively tested them .",
    "they also match the stellar population models used by @xcite and we would like to be able to compare the results of applying an mcmc approach without increasing the complexity of the comparison with previous results .",
    "we note that some ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have advocated the use of a rising exponential star formation rate which would be useful to include in future analyses of these objects .",

    "ironically , udf12 - 3954 - 6284 was detected in only one wfc3 broad band filter and is one of the three objects with the strongest probabilities of being at high redshift .",
    "+ the second object with follow - up spectroscopic observations is udfy-38135539 , all of which were obtained with ground - based instruments . it was first observed with sinfoni on the vlt ( integration time of 14.8 hr ) , centered on the _ j_-band ( 1.1 - 1.4 @xmath13 ) resulting in a reported 6@xmath57 detection of ly@xmath6 , placing the galaxy at z @xmath19 8.555 @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations using x - shooter ( 0.3 - 2.5 @xmath13 ) on the vlt and moircs ( 0.9 - 1.78 @xmath13 ) on subaru ( 5 hr and 11 hr integration times , respectively ) , have disputed this claim based on non - detections of ly@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "they further noted that the _ f105w _ wfc3 photometry is inconsistent with both the line flux claimed by @xcite and the redshift from @xcite . if the redshift were correct , then the _ f105w _",
    "flux should be detected at 15@xmath57 .",
    "the discrepancy between predicted f105w fluxes from sed - fitting ( assuming high-@xmath0  and a real line detection ) and the actual measured f105w fluxes raises some concern regarding the true nature of this object .",
    "+ using  we find that there are two populations of low-@xmath0  galaxies which fit the available data as well as the high-@xmath0  solutions .",
    "the first are low - moderate dusty systems at @xmath65 , the second are significantly dustier objects ( up to _",
    "a_@xmath66 @xmath19 4 ) at @xmath67 .",
    "distinguishing between these low-@xmath0  solutions requires significantly more sensitive / deeper acs and irac observations ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) than are currently available ( note : these would also serve to reject or improve the likelihood of high-@xmath0  redshifts as well ) .",
    "deeper irac observations , should any be undertaken in the remaining time of the _ spitzer _ warm mission , must contend with reaching source confusion limits as well as the higher background noise from operating in `` warm mode . ''",
    "contrary to common wisdom and the conclusions reached by other high-@xmath0  studies , deeper observations blue - ward ( e.g _ f850lp _ or _ f814w _ ) of the presumptive break _",
    "be extremely useful .",
    "( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can seek sources that are brightened by lensing due to foreground galaxy clusters to get more flux from high-@xmath0  sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , only a limited volume can be probed using this method .",
    "+ unfortunately , deeper observations in the optical bands using acs are not likely considering the prohibitive observing times that would be required .",
    "slitless spectroscopic observations using wfc3 with the g141 grism would provide an excellent method of rejecting or supporting the claims of high redshifts .",
    "however , this requires multiple position angles to avoid contamination from other objects or observational artifacts in the field as well as observations significantly deeper than those attempted to date @xcite .",
    "the g141 wfc3 grism observations would have the sensitivity to detect the emission lines potentially responsible for the observed photometric breaks .",
    "for example , in the case of object udf12 - 3954 - 6284 , an emission line with a flux as low as @xmath68  could be solely responsible for a 29.3 mag detection in the f160w filter .",
    "such a faint line would require upward of forty - two orbits to be _ significantly _ detected . in the absence of deeper hst or irac observations",
    ", observers will have to await the launch of _",
    "we estimate that 10ks observations at @xmath69 m using nircam with the _ jwst _ would be deep enough to confirm that the observed photometric breaks are strong enough to be 1216  breaks .",
    "until such observations are made , the nature as well as the volume density of very high redshift candidates are likely to remain uncertain unless significantly deeper acs or wfc3 observations are taken . at the very least",
    ", our analysis suggests that the uncertainties of current estimates of the volume density of these objects should be adjusted to account for the possibility that nearly one in four of these objects is not a high redshift galaxy .",

    "<S> in the absence of spectra , the technique of fitting model galaxy template spectra to observed photometric fluxes has become the workhorse method for determining the redshifts and other properties for high-@xmath0  galaxy candidates . in this paper , we present an analysis of the most recent and possibly most distant galaxies ( @xmath18  12 ) discovered in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) using a more robust method of redshift estimation based on markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) fitting , in contrast to the `` best fit '' models obtained using simpler @xmath2@xmath3  minimization techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of mcmc fitting is the ability to accurately estimate the probability density function of the redshift , for each object as well as any input model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to derive accurate credible intervals by properly marginalizing over all other input model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our method to 13 recently identified sources in the hudf and show that , despite claims based on @xmath2@xmath3 minimization , none of these sources can be securely ruled out as low redshift interlopers ( @xmath44 ) due to the low signal - to - noise of currently available observations . </S>",
