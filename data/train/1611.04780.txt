    "in the field of superconductivity , symmetry of the cooper - pair wavefunction in spin- , time- , and orbital - spaces has attracted much attention for the past few decades . within the framework of superconductivity theory developed by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs),@xcite it is established that a cooper pair is formed by two electrons with momentums @xmath5 and @xmath6 near the fermi surface . due to the fermi - dirac statistics ,",
    "the cooper - pair wavefunction must have sign change in the exchange of the two electrons . in the spin space",
    ", cooper pair can be classified into either singlet or triplet type . as for the orbital part of the pair wavefunction ,",
    "when we focus on the symmetry with respect to the exchange of two momentums @xmath5 and @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 , one can define the parity of the cooper pair .",
    "for the conventional bcs superconductors like al , pb and nb , in the presence of the translational symmetry ( @xmath8 ) and together with the space- , time - inversion and spin - rotational symmetries , the cooper pairs are in the singlet even - frequency even - parity state , in consistent with the fermi - dirac statistics . here , even / odd frequency refers to the situation that the pair wavefunction is even / odd with respect to the exchange of time coordinates .    in 1974 , berezinskii considered the possibility of the triplet even - frequency pairing with even parity in the observed phase of @xmath9he.@xcite after that , the possibilities of the cooper pair with other symmetries are extensively studied , and from the symmetry analysis,@xcite cooper pairs can be classified into ( i ) singlet even - frequency ( se ) with even parity ; ( ii ) singlet odd - frequency ( so ) with odd parity ; ( iii ) triplet odd - frequency ( to ) with even parity ; ( iv ) triplet even - frequency ( te ) with odd parity . specifically , after the proposal by berezinskii , to pairing has been discussed in a wide variety of theoretical models with spin - rotational and time - inversion asymmetries,@xcite e.g. , kondo model,@xcite hubbard model@xcite and heavy fermion system.@xcite meanwhile , several proposals about the so pairing have also been reported in the inhomogeneous systems with space- and time - inversion asymmetries by introducing effective @xmath1-wave electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction.@xcite in the presence of the odd - frequency pairings , by considering the retardation effect of the electron interaction , odd - frequency gaps or odd - frequency order parameters are theoretically suggested.@xcite however , up till now , odd - frequency bulk superconductor has not yet been realized experimentally .",
    "moreover , it is now commonly believed that the pairing in superfluid @xmath9he is in the te type.@xcite recently , much effort has been focused on the superconductivity in material sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11 due to the generally recognized similarity to that in @xmath9he.@xcite the pairing and order parameter in superconducting sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11 are theoretically suggested@xcite and primarily confirmed from recent experiments@xcite to be the @xmath1-wave te type .",
    "furthermore , it is reported very recently that the te pairing and order parameter can also be realized in the non - centrosymmetric superconductor@xcite with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) existing in nature,@xcite whose experimental confirmations are still in progress .",
    "although it is not easy so far to realize odd - frequency superconductivity and/or triplet one in the uniform bulk system , it is more promising to induce these pairings in the inhomogeneous systems with lower symmetry .",
    "specifically , in the last decade , the proximity effect has been studied intensively in multilayered structures consisting of superconductors and non - superconducting systems and it is well known that the superconducting correlation can penetrate into the normal region . in superconductor - ferromagnet structure , with the time - inversion and spin - rotational asymmetries , it is well established that the to pairing is induced in ferromagnet.@xcite moreover , it was predicted that with the inhomogeneous ferromagnet , the induced to pairing can diffuse into the ferromagnet with the longer diffusion length than that of the se one.@xcite nevertheless , with the conventional @xmath0-wave e - e interaction , the to gap ( i.e. , the to order parameter ) is zero .",
    "similar to the magnetization , the soc can also break the spin - rotational symmetry .",
    "together , with the broken space - inversion symmetry by the soc , the te pairing is expected to be induced,@xcite which was first pointed out by gorkov and rashba in @xmath0-wave superconductor with the soc induced by the absorption of ion.@xcite then , a great deal of efforts have been devoted to the multilayered structures consisting of superconductors and spin - orbit - coupled non - superconducting systems as a natural extension.@xcite the induced te pairing is further proved to possess parallel spin projection to the effective magnetic field due to the soc.@xcite however , even in the presence of the te pairing , with the momentum - independent @xmath0-wave e - e interaction , no te gap ( te order parameter ) is realized .",
    "nevertheless , de gennes pointed out that in the non - superconducting material proximity to superconductor , the pairing penetrating from superconductor experiences the many - body interaction,@xcite and hence order parameter can be induced even with a repulsive effective e - e interaction . following the work by de gennes,@xcite it is reported by yu and wu very recently that the te order parameter is induced in the spin - orbit coupled quantum well ( qw ) in proximity to @xmath0-wave superconductor.@xcite specifically , with the induced te pairing in qw by the soc , they showed that from the self - energy of the e - e coulomb interaction , the te order parameter can be induced .    except for the multilayered structures ,",
    "the study of the mixed types of cooper pairs in superconductors with vortex structure , where the translational symmetry is broken , has a long history.@xcite it is known that due to the translational asymmetry , the so pairing is induced near the vortex core.@xcite moreover , except for the extrinsic breakdown of the translational symmetry by vortex , there exists a high - magnetic - field phase in the superconductor , referred as fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase,@xcite where the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken by inducing a finite center - of - mass ( cm ) momentum @xmath12 of the cooper pair . in the fflo phase , the zeeman energy leads to different fermi surfaces for spin - up and -down electrons , and then by inducing a finite cm momentum of the cooper pair , the pairing region between the spin - up and -down electrons near the fermi surfaces can be maximized , leading to the free energy minimized .",
    "consequently , there exist pairing electrons and unpairing ones in the fflo phase .",
    "furthermore , with translational and spin - rotational asymmetries by the magnetic field , all four types of pairings are expected to be induced.@xcite nevertheless , with the conventional symmetric @xmath0-wave e - e interaction , only the se order parameter exists in the fflo phase .",
    "it is natural to consider the possibility to induce and manipulate all four types of order parameters , which may lead to rich physics especially for the quasiparticles .",
    "furthermore , besides the fflo phase , the translational symmetry can also be broken by the supercurrent in superconductors , which also leads to the cm momentum of cooper pair , as revealed both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite in recent works .",
    "multilayered structures consisting of non - superconducting systems and @xmath0-wave superconductors in fflo phase or with a supercurrent hence naturally come to our attention .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the order parameters containing all four types of symmetry , i.e. , the se , so , te and to , can be realized in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) of the spin - orbit - coupled insb ( 110 ) qw@xcite in proximity to @xmath0-wave superconductors in fflo phase or with a supercurrent .",
    "specifically , the se order parameter can be induced in qw through the proximity effect .",
    "we show that there exist unpairing regions in the momentum space , where the proximity - induced se order parameter vanishes .",
    "it is further revealed that the unpairing regions arise from the fflo - phase - like blocking in qw . with this proximity - induced se order parameter , so ( te ) pairing is induced due to the broken translational ( spin - rotational ) symmetry by the cm momentum of cooper pair ( soc ) . with the translational and spin - rorational asymmetries , the to pairing can also be induced .",
    "then , we show that from the self - energy due to the e - e coulomb interaction with the dynamical screening,@xcite the corresponding order parameters can be induced and the proximity - induced se order parameter is also renormalized .",
    "particularly , we reveal that the odd - frequency order parameters are induced due to the retardation effect of the coulomb interaction from the dynamic screening in 2deg , where the plasmon effect is important .",
    "in addition , the induced triplet order parameters are shown to possess parallel spin projections to the effective magnetic field due to the soc , similar to the previous works.@xcite    differing from the vanishing proximity - induced se order parameter in the unpairing regions , it is found that through the renormalization due to the e - e coulomb interaction , the se , so , te and to ones in qw all have small strengths in the unpairing regions . moreover , in the pairing regions , rich behaviors of the order parameters containing all four types of symmetry are revealed .",
    "specifically , the se order parameter @xmath13 exhibits an @xmath0-wave behavior in the momentum space , while the induced so ( te ) one @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) shows a @xmath1-wave character .",
    "particularly , with the broken translational symmetry by the cm momentum of cooper pair , the @xmath1-wave character of the induced so order parameter shows anisotropy with respect to the direction of the cm momentum .",
    "this is very different from the te one , which is determined by the soc and hence is independent on the direction of cm momentum .",
    "as for the induced to order parameter @xmath16 , the unconventional @xmath2-wave character in the momentum space is revealed and particularly , when the cm momentum is along the @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] directions , the @xmath3-wave and @xmath4-wave characters can be obtained , respectively .",
    "this anisotropy of the to order parameter is further proved to arise from the unique soc structure in insb ( 110 ) qw .",
    "the specific behaviors of the order parameters containing all four types of symmetry are summarized in table  [ torder ] .",
    "furthermore , we show that at proper density , the se order parameter can be efficiently suppressed through the renormalization from the repulsive e - e coulomb interaction , as revealed in the previous work,@xcite and the induced so , te and to order parameters can be detected and distinguished experimentally .",

    "<S> we show that all the singlet even - frequency , singlet odd - frequency , triplet even - frequency and triplet odd - frequency pairings , and together with the corresponding order parameters ( gaps ) can be realized in insb ( 110 ) spin - orbit - coupled quantum well in proximity to @xmath0-wave superconductor in fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov phase or with a supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> it is revealed that with the singlet even - frequency order parameter induced by the proximity effect , triplet even - frequency pairing is induced due to the broken spin - rotational symmetry by the spin - orbit coupling . since the translational symmetry is broken by the center - of - mass momentum of cooper pair in the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov phase or with a supercurrent , the singlet odd - frequency pairing can be induced . with the translational and spin - rotational asymmetries , </S>",
    "<S> the triplet odd - frequency pairing is also realized . </S>",
    "<S> then , we show that the corresponding order parameters can be obtained from the self - energy of the electron - electron coulomb interaction with the dynamic screening . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet and the induced triplet even - frequency order parameters are found to exhibit the conventional @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave characters in the momentum space , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> whereas for the induced odd - frequency order parameters in quantum well , the singlet and triplet ones show the @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave characters , respectively . moreover , the @xmath1-wave character of the singlet odd - frequency order parameter exhibits anisotropy with respect to the direction of the center - of - mass momentum . while for the triplet one </S>",
    "<S> , we find that @xmath3-wave and @xmath4-wave characters can be obtained with respect to the direction of the center - of - mass momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at proper density , the singlet even - frequency order parameter is suppressed and the induced singlet odd - frequency , triplet even - frequency and triplet odd - frequency ones can be detected experimentally . </S>"
