    "this paper is concerned with the study of two integrable quantum spin chains . by integrable",
    "we mean that the chains are exactly solvable in the non - diffractive @xcite yang - baxter sense @xcite , with infinitely many conserved quantities and an underlying bethe ansatz solution .",
    "the two particular models are variants of the spin-1 and spin-@xmath1 chains based on the family of integrable su(@xmath4 ) permutator models @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional classical lattice model counterparts are the @xmath5 models @xcite , aka the perk - schultz model @xcite in a special case .    over the past few decades considerable effort",
    "has been invested in the analysis of exactly solved models in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance here is the calculation of the temperature - dependent properties @xcite .",
    "this began with the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) approach @xcite and has most recently evolved into the exact high temperature expansion ( hte ) method @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients of the hte method are the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) @xcite and the t - system @xcite , from which one derives nonlinear integral equations which can be solved in an exact perturbative fashion . to date this approach has been applied to the heisenberg model @xcite , the @xmath6 models @xcite , the higher spin heisenberg model @xcite and to integrable quantum spin ladders @xcite . in particular , it has been demonstrated that integrable models can be used to study real ladder compounds @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the tba method was seen to be most convenient for predicting critical fields @xcite of relevance to the quantum phase transitions in ladder compounds .",
    "on the other hand , the hte method gave the temperature - dependent free energy , from which physical properties such as the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat were derived .",
    "excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental results for the strong coupling ladder compounds has been found @xcite .    here",
    "we apply the tba and hte methods to calculate the thermal and magnetic properties of spin-1 and spin-@xmath1 chains .",
    "low - dimensional spin systems continue to reveal rich and novel quantum magnetic effects , such as fractional magnetization plateaux @xcite and spin - peierls transitions @xcite .",
    "the effects of inter- and intra - chain interactions , single - ion anisotropy , biquadratic exchange interactions and the magnetic field all provide competing contributions in the low - temperature physics . as",
    "an example consider the spin-@xmath7 heisenberg chain @xcite : if @xmath8 is odd , the next - nearest - neighbour exchange interaction and anisotropy may drive the chain into either a non - magnetic singlet ground state ( spin - peierls transition ) @xcite or a magnetic gapped ground state @xcite .",
    "conversely , if @xmath8 is even the haldane gap may be closed in the presence of additional biquadratic terms or in - plane anisotropy . in general ,",
    "the haldane phase exists only in @xmath8 even heisenberg chains with antiferromagnetic coupling , no gap appears in ferromagnetic heisenberg chains .",
    "accordingly one expects a rich quantum phase diagram to emerge for low - dimensional spin chains .",
    "more specifically , the intra- and inter - chain exchange interactions may result in either a valence - bond - solid haldane phase or a dimerized phase @xcite , whereas large single - ion anisotropy may trigger a field - induced gapped phase @xcite significantly different from the standard haldane phase .",
    "the spin-1 heisenberg chain has been extensively studied in the context of haldane gapped materials @xcite .",
    "recently an anomaly in the susceptibility has been observed in the spin-1 compounds livge@xmath9o@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "such new materials have drawn attention from both theorists and experimentalists @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg spin-1 chain with additional biquadratic interaction has also been studied with regard to the haldane phase @xcite . in particular , the susceptibility of livge@xmath9o@xmath10 can be quantitatively explained with the spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic chain @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a field - theoretic approach to the heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chain with single - ion anisotropy was suggested by tsvelik @xcite .",
    "his theoretical predictions are in good agreement with experimental results for the compound ni(c@xmath9h@xmath11n@xmath9)no@xmath9clo@xmath12 .",
    "the haldane gapped phase is observed in some one - dimensional materials exhibiting a weak single - ion anisotropy @xmath13 , such that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the nearest - neighbour exchange interaction . however , a large anisotropy ( @xmath16 ) can also produce a gapped phase @xcite , which is significantly different from the haldane phase found in weakly anisotropic compounds . in this latter case ,",
    "the haldane nondegenerate ground state is a valence - bond solid state @xcite in which a single valence bond connects each neighbouring pair to form a singlet .",
    "an expected excitation from the valence - bond solid state arises from a configuration in which a nonmagnetic state @xmath17 at site @xmath18 is substituted for a state with @xmath19 . in this way",
    "a total spin-1 excitation creates an energy referred to as the energy gap .",
    "however , bond alternation may lead to a dimerized ground state in which double valence bonds form two singlets between pairs of neighboring spins . by breaking one dimer with a nonmagnetic state at site @xmath18",
    ", a total spin-1 excitation is also separated .    on the other hand ,",
    "the field - induced gapped phase in the spin-1 chain is caused by trivalent orbital splitting , i.e. , the singlet and doublet orbitals are separated by a crystal - field splitting .",
    "the singlet can occupy all states such that the ground state lies in the nondegenerate gapped phase .",
    "the lowest excitation arises as the doublet becomes involved in the ground state .",
    "this gapped phase is observed in some nickel salts with large zero - field splitting , such as nisncl@xmath20h@xmath9o @xcite , [ ni(c@xmath21h@xmath21no)@xmath10](clo@xmath12)@xmath9 @xcite and ni(no@xmath23)@xmath24h@xmath9o @xcite .",

    "ni(c@xmath26h@xmath11n@xmath9)@xmath9ni(cn)@xmath12@xmath27h@xmath9o ( abbreviated nbyc ) @xcite ,    have also been identified as effective heisenberg magnetic chains .",
    "this class of compounds exhibits a nondegenerate ground state which can be separated from the lowest excitation .",
    "theoretical studies of these compounds have relied on a molecular field approximation via the van vleck equation @xcite .",
    "to first order van vleck approximation the exchange interaction is neglected and an effective crystalline field is incorporated to fit the experimental data .",
    "not surprisingly these approximations cause some discrepancies in fitting the data .",
    "although there has been some theoretical interpretation , the nature of the quantum phase transitions as well as the general microscopic hamiltonian remains to be fully clarified for these compounds .",
    "in this paper we consider integrable one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 models with large planar single - ion anisotropy .",
    "we find that for the integrable spin-@xmath0 chain the non - magnetic singlet and the magnetic doublet states can be separated from the lowest magnon excitation by an energy gap .",
    "a large single - ion anisotropy together with in - plane anisotropy may trigger a non - magnetic mid - plateau , leading to a  ferrimagnetic - antiferromagnetic \" phase transition .",
    "significantly , a different type of gapped phase compared to the standard haldane phase is found .",
    "we examine some real spin-@xmath0 compounds via tba and hte .",
    "excellent agreement between our theoretical predictions and the experimental results for spin-@xmath0 compounds such as nickel salts and magnetic chains ( nenc , nbyc and ndpk ) is found .",
    "our results show that the strong single - ion anisotropy , which is induced by an orbital splitting , can dominate the behaviour of these compounds .    for the integrable spin-@xmath1 chain the magnetic gapped ground state can be separated from the lowest magnon excitation , in contrast to the non - magnetic haldane gapped phase in the spin-@xmath0 chain .",
    "a magnetization plateau at @xmath28 originates at zero magnetic field .",
    "moreover , an appropriately chosen value of the anisotropy can open a one third magnetization plateau reminiscent of the mixed spin-(1,@xmath29 ) ladder model @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we introduce the integrable su(3 ) spin-@xmath0 chain and briefly review its exact solution .",
    "then in we discuss the ground state properties via the tba . in",
    "we derive the high temperature magnetic properties via the hte method .",
    "we then discuss the application of the tba and the hte methods to real spin-@xmath0 materials with single - ion and in - plane anisotropies in .",
    "in particular , we examine the thermal and magnetic properties of the nickel salt nisncl@xmath20h@xmath9o ( ) and the magnetic chains nenc ( ) , nbyc ( ) and ndpk ( ) by comparing our tba and hte results with the experimental data for the specific heat , magnetic susceptibiliy and magnetization , where available . in",
    "we apply the same approach to the su(4 ) case in the context of the integrable spin-@xmath1 chain .",
    "concluding remarks are given in .",
    "initially , the haldane gap was identified in some quasi one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 materials @xcite described by the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath30 in a parallel external magnetic field @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 denotes the spin-@xmath0 operator at site @xmath18 and @xmath33 is the number of sites .",
    "the constants @xmath15 and @xmath13 denote the exchange spin - spin coupling strength and single - ion anisotropy , respectively .",
    "the bohr magneton is denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the lande factor . for the compound nenp @xcite",
    "the energy gap @xmath36 between the ground state and the first excited state is of magnitude @xmath37 k with the coupling constants @xmath38 k and @xmath39 . while for the compound nino @xcite , @xmath40 k with @xmath41 k and @xmath42 .",
    "the above hamiltonian has been recognized as a good model for haldane - like compounds and has thus found widespread interest in the theoretical community @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it does not appear to be integrable .",
    "however , if the spin - spin interaction term is changed , the model is integrable , and thus amenable to exact calculations using the sophisticated and well developed machinery of integrable models .",
    "we shall see below that under favourable conditions the modified hamiltonian exhibits similar physical behaviour .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath43 which only differs from the heisenberg hamiltonian in the additional biquadratic interaction term .-",
    "invariant spin-1 hamiltonians , each involving biquadratic interactions @xcite . only the model considered here , with two - body interactions based on the permutation operator , appears to allow the desired chemical potential terms .",
    "] we discuss the on - site chemical potential terms @xmath44 in detail further below .",
    "leaving aside @xmath44 , the model is the integrable @xmath2 spin-@xmath0 chain , which is well understood @xcite .",
    "it belongs to a family of solvable models with lie algebra @xmath6 symmetry , which are generalized multi - state vertex models @xcite .",
    "the spin-1 chain was originally considered by uimin @xcite in 1970 and later in the context of multi - state permutation operators by sutherland @xcite . a key ingredient is the identity @xcite p_i , j = _",
    "i_j + ( _ i_j)^2 -*i*_i_j , [ eq : permutationidentity ] where @xmath45 is the identity operator .",
    "we are thus considering the model = j _",
    "i=1^l p_i , i+1 + h _ [ eq : eq : ham1 ] acting on @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a three - dimensional vector space and @xmath48 is the permutation operator , acting trivially on all sites , except sites @xmath18 and @xmath49 , where p_i , i+1 = .",
    "we take the spin - spin exchange interaction @xmath15 to be antiferromagnetic ( @xmath50 ) .    a crucial point in the following tba and",
    "hte analysis is the observation that the form of the permutation operator is not dependent on which basis spans @xmath47 .",
    "accordingly we always choose a local basis which diagonalizes the chemical potential terms .",
    "the chemical potentials characterize physical on - site interaction terms in the model hamiltonian . fortunately there is freedom to adjust them without losing integrability .",
    "to simplify the bethe ansatz , we apply periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , we identify @xmath51 and @xmath52 . following the standard approach this model",
    "can be solved by the nested bethe ansatz @xcite , which gives the energy eigenvalues [ page : betheansatz1 ] @xmath53 in terms of bethe roots of flavour / colour @xmath54 .",
    "only the bethe roots of first flavour @xmath55appear in the energy expression .",
    "the roots are determined by solutions to the bethe equations @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    in eq .",

    "we do not specify the basis here , rather we are free to choose the _ order _ of the basis and we will exploit this in the tba analysis of the ground state , as done in the tba analysis of the integrable ladder models @xcite .",
    "we choose the chemical potential terms which most closely model the physics of the compounds as used in the literature .",
    "the most general chemical potential terms exhibited in the real compounds are of the form @xmath72 the first term in each equation describes the effect of an external magnetic field @xmath31 , which can be applied either parallel or perpendicular to the quantization axis given by the sample geometry .",
    "the in - plane anisotropy and planar anisotropy effects may be detected in magnetic properties of a single crystal .",
    "actually , we can transform the transverse external magnetic field @xmath73 in to the @xmath74 direction via the following equivalent chemical potentials @xmath75 therefore , the magnetic field perpendicular to the quantized axis provides a way to examine thermodynamic properties for the powdered samples via the chemical potentials .",
    "we will assume that @xmath76 and interpret it as a planar / single - ion anisotropy modelling the effect of crystal - field splitting .",
    "the third contribution describes an in - plane anisotropy effect which breaks the @xmath77 symmetry .",
    "we consider only the case @xmath78 .",
    "although we do not need to consider the ( complicated ) eigenbasis of the chemical potential terms or in performing the algebraic bethe ansatz and applying the hte method , the eigenbasis for different chemical potentials is helpful in analyzing the ground state properties of the hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenbasis could for instance be presented as linear combinations of the spin projection onto the @xmath74-axis eigenstates @xmath79 $ ] where the coefficients are dependent on @xmath31 , @xmath13 and @xmath80 .",
    "the eigenbasis for the hamiltonian with different chemical potentials will be given in the following tba analysis .",
    "the eigenvalues of the chemical potentials are given by @xmath81 for and , respectively .",
    "note that we can adjust the chemical potential terms to model the physics of a specific compound without losing integrability , but we have no freedom in changing the spin - spin exchange interaction fixed by the permutation identity . in this way",
    ", the integrable @xmath2 chain may describe some real compounds having either a spin - spin interaction close to the permutation interaction or exhibiting a strong single - ion anisotropy which effectively dominates the intrachain exchange interaction in the ground state .",
    "fortunately , compounds are known where the relative strength @xmath82 or @xmath83 are very small .",
    "thus the planar and in - plane anisotropies tend to dominate the physics .",
    "a large @xmath13 anisotropy may trigger a gapped phase where the singlet occupies the whole ground state .",
    "in such a phase , the bethe reference state becomes the true physical ground state , with bethe numbers @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the bethe equations equal to zero .",
    "the lowest excitation arises from a configuration in which the doublet is involved in the ground state .",
    "this excitation gives the energy gap , which can be caculated either from the energy in terms of the bethe equations or from the tba equations .",
    "we shall see that both the magnetic field and the in - plane anisotropy decrease the energy gap .",
    "we consider the thermodynamic limit in which the bethe equations have different types of solutions .",
    "the real roots , called magnons , form the ground state .",
    "pairs of complex conjugated roots form bound states of two magnons .",
    "there are many kinds of bound states .",

    "we give them below for different configurations , i.e. , we will permute the basis order to enable the simplest analysis of different regions in the parameter space @xmath93 .",
    "we define the so - called _ dressed energies _ @xmath94 via @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "they play the role of excitation energies , measured from the fermi energy level for each flavour and satisfy fermi statistics . in the limit @xmath97 , only the negative part of the dressed energies , @xmath98 , contributes to the ground state energy .",
    "thus the tba equations reduce to two coupled nonlinear integral equations @xmath99 the solution of these equations provides a clear physical picture of the ground state properties .     with the origin ( @xmath100 ) at the minima .",

    "the assignment @xmath104 $ ] with @xmath105 naturally depends on the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath80 , which change the energy level of the chemical potentials ( as , e.g. , in ) .",
    "the driving terms @xmath107 are then positive or negative in defined regions @xcite allowing for a simple determination of critical fields and gaps .",
    "the band fillings are controlled by these driving terms . in the absence of symmetry - breaking potentials",
    "all bands are completely filled , i.e. , their fermi bundaries are their value at infinity , with @xmath108 .",
    "in this part of the tba analysis we discuss the most general hamiltonian with both anisotropies , @xmath76 and @xmath109 , with an external parallel magnetic field @xmath31 . in later sections",
    "we specialize to cases without in - plane anisotropy to model certain physical compounds .",
    "the perpendicular magnetic field term with eigenvalues - can be treated in the same manner .",
    "but the in - plane and planar anisotropies play different roles under perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields .    starting with hamiltonian without chemical potentials , i.e. with @xmath110 , where the model has @xmath2 symmetry with the fundamental basis @xmath62= \\st[\\!\\!+\\!\\!1]$ ] , @xmath63= \\st[0]$ ] and @xmath64=\\st[\\!\\!-\\!\\!1]$ ] .",
