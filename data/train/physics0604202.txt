    "spontaneous motion of droplets on solid substrate driven by chemical reactions that influence wetting properties has been observed in a number of experiments @xcite .",
    "more recently , a reversible setup allowing for restoration of substrate properties and thereby making permanent motion possible has been realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "spontaneous motion has been observed also in processes of surface freezing and melting @xcite",
    ". the cause of chemically driven motion is deposition of a poorly wettable material on the substrate or , alternatively , dissolution of an adsorbed wettable layer beneath the droplet . as a result",
    ", the droplet tends to migrate to the area with more favorable wetting properties outside its footprint .",
    "the direction of motion , originally chosen at random , is sustained because the area left behind is either permanently left nonwettable or takes time being restored .",
    "chemically driven motion is of interest both in microfluidics applications and as a possible mechanism for the formation of surface patterns .    the theoretical model of chemically driven droplet motion presented recently @xcite combined hydrodynamic equations in lubrication approximation with a linear reaction - diffusion equation for adsorbed species . the model included a precursor layer that served to resolve the contact line singularity",
    "the model equations were solved numerically , mapping the regimes of motion and its dependence on various parameters of the problem .",
    "the results showed , in particular , that droplets become immobile when diffusion and substrate modification are sufficiently fast .",
    "the computations were , however , restricted to moderate ratios of the bulk droplet size to the precursor layer thickness , since numerical routines are all but impossible to implement for realistic very large ratios .    in this communication",
    ", i present an analytical solution of the problem combining an integral solution of the reaction - diffusion equation for a steadily propagating droplet @xcite with velocity computation using the solvability condition of perturbed hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the hydrodynamic problem is considered in section  [ s0 ] .",
    "the approach , based on the lubrication approximation , is the same as in the theory of creeping motion of droplets under the action of externally imposed gradients .",
    "the perturbation approach to the problem of motion driven by surface inhomogeneities was pioneered by greenspan @xcite who had , however , to rely on a phenomenological relation for the motion of the contact line .",
    "brochard @xcite derived droplet translation velocity using integral balances between various driving forces and viscous dissipation .",
    "the latter poses a special problem in view of the notorious contact line singularity , which can be resolved either by introducing a slip length @xcite or by allowing for an ultrathin precursor layer @xcite .",
    "the latter approach has been applied to derive integral conditions for a droplet driven either by an external field ( gravity ) or changes in the precursor thickness due to droplet interactions @xcite .",
    "the result , applied later also to 2d droplets driven by a difference of advancing and receding contact angles , turned out to give even better approximation than more elaborate theory using a precise solution of lubrication equations to compute the shape of the bulk droplet @xcite .",
    "the integral condition for droplet motion will be derived in section  [ s1 ] in a more formal way as a solvability condition of perturbation equations , using an eigenfunction of the adjoint problem introduced earlier for a 2d problem @xcite .",
    "the contact line singularity will be resolved , however , in a more traditional way through introducing a slip length , and the solvability condition will be re - derived for this model .",
    "both approaches to eliminating the singularity are indistinguishable on a macroscopic level , leading to a model - dependent logarithmic factor @xcite , and therefore the result does not need to rest on the existence of a macroscopic precursor or depend on a precise way the hydrodynamic equations have to be modified in the immediate vicinity of the substrate .    in sections  [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] ,",
    "i shall concentrate on the reversible setup of refs .",
    "the basic approach is described in section  [ s0 ] , followed by the velocity computation for a single steadily propagating droplet both in fast ( section  [ s31 ] ) and slow ( section  [ s34 ] ) diffusion limits and in a general case ( section  [ s36 ] ) .",
    "the principal result obtained in the fast diffusion ( slow velocity ) limit is the existence of a supercritical traveling bifurcation analogous to a similar transition in activator - inhibitor systems @xcite .",
    "i further investigate droplet interactions on either side of this transition , resulting in relaxation to a regular stationary pattern sustained by long - range repulsion ( section  [ s42 ] ) or scattering of mobile droplets ( section  [ s41 ] ) .",
