    "proton - proton elastic scattering was measured by the totem experiment at the cern large hadron collider at @xmath0 = 7 tev in dedicated runs  @xcite . to detect leading protons scattered at angles as small as 1@xmath1rad",
    ", silicon sensors are placed in movable beam - pipe insertions , so - called `` roman pots '' ( rp ) , located symmetrically on either side of the lhc intersection point ip5 at distances up to @xmath2 m from it .",
    "each rp station is composed of two units separated by a distance of about @xmath3 m .",
    "a unit consists of 3 rps , two approaching the outgoing beam vertically and one horizontally , allowing for a partial overlap between horizontal and vertical detectors and the alignment precision of 10 @xmath1 m .",
    "scattered protons are detected in the roman pots after having moved through a segment of the lhc lattice containing 29 magnets per beam . the trajectory of protons with transverse positions superscript indicates the lhc interaction point 5 ] @xmath4 and angles @xmath5 at ip5 are described with a linear formula @xmath6 where @xmath7 with nominal beam momentum @xmath8 and momentum loss @xmath9 .",
    "the transport matrix @xmath10 is defined by the optical functions @xmath11 the _ magnification _ @xmath12 and the _ effective length _",
    "@xmath13 are functions of the _ betatron amplitude _ @xmath14 and the relative _ phase advance _ @xmath15 and are particularly important for the proton kinematics reconstruction .",
    "the coupling coefficients @xmath16 are close to 0 and the vertex contributions are canceled due to the anti - symmetry of the scattering angles .",
    "therefore , the kinematics of elastically scattered protons at ip5 can be reconstructed from equation  ( [ proton_trajectories ] ) as : @xmath17 where  rp \" defines the measurement location .",
    "as the values of the reconstructed angles are directly inversely proportional to the optical functions , the accuracy of optics defines the systematic errors of the final physics results .",
    "the proton transport matrix @xmath18 over a distance of @xmath19 is defined by the machine settings @xmath20 .",
    "it is calculated with the mad - x @xcite code for each group of runs with identical optics based on several data sources .",
    "the magnet currents are retrieved from timber @xcite and are converted to strengths with lsa @xcite , which implements the conversion curves measured by fidel @xcite .",
    "the wise database @xcite contains the measured imperfections ( field harmonics , magnet displacements and rotations ) .",
    "however , the lattice is subject to additional @xmath21 _ imperfections _ , not measured well enough so far , which alter the transport matrix by @xmath22 : @xmath23 the 510% precision of @xmath24 beating measurement does not allow to estimate @xmath22 with the accuracy required by the totem physics program .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath25 can be evaluated from the tolerances of the lhc imperfections of which the most important are :    * strength conversion error @xmath26 * beam momentum offset @xmath27 .",
    "their impact on optical functions is presented in table @xmath28 .",
    "it is clearly visible that the imperfections of the inner triplet ( the mqxa and mqxb magnets ) are of high influence on the transport matrix while the optics is less sensitive to the quadrupoles mqy and mqml .",
    "other imperfections are of lower significance :    * magnet rotations @xmath29 mrad * beam harmonics @xmath30 * power converter errors @xmath31 * magnet positions @xmath32 m .    generally , as can be seen in table  [ lysensitivity ] , for large @xmath33 optics the magnitude of @xmath22 is sufficiently small from the viewpoint of data analysis and therefore @xmath22 does not need to be precisely estimated . however , the low @xmath33 optics sensitivity to the machine imperfections is significant and can not be neglected .",
    "fortunately , in this case @xmath22 can be determined precisely enough from the proton tracks in the roman pots .",

    "totem proposed a novel approach to optics estimation .",
    "first of all , the method allows to asses the optical functions errors from machine tolerances .",
