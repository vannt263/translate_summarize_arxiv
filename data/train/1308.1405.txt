    ".    given the potential importance of the anisotropy in the observed properties of laes , it is useful to investigate emission with systems of analytic setups incorporating prescriptions of anisotropy .",
    "such an investigation can guide our analyses of emission from simulated galaxies and help our understanding of the role of anisotropy in shaping the emission from laes . in this paper , we perform such a study .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in   [",
    "sec : model ] , we describe how we build models of neutral hydrogen clouds with spatial or kinematic anisotropy for radiative transfer calculation",
    ". then we present the results of anisotropies in the escaping emission from these models in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : summary ] we summarize our investigation and discuss the implications on studying emission from star - forming galaxies .",
    "to investigate the effect of anisotropic density and velocity distribution on the emission , we construct three simple models of spherical neutral hydrogen gas clouds .",
    "the first two models intend to investigate the effects of anisotropy induced by density and velocity separately .",
    "the third one is motivated by galactic wind and mimics an outflow confined in a cone .",
    "for all the three models , the temperature of the neutral hydrogen atoms in each cloud is fixed at @xmath1  k. the emitting source is assumed to be a point source located at the cloud center .",
    "we emphasize that while our models may capture different aspects of the gas distribution around galaxies , by no means they are realistic .",
    "the purpose of the study is to investigate the effects from the anisotropy in the two main quantities that affects radiative transfer , i.e. , density and velocity . instead of more sophisticated models with various couplings between density and velocity ,",
    "we intentionally separate them and build simple models to see the effect from each component .",
    "the first model we consider is a `` density gradient '' case . in this model",
    ", there is no bulk motion of the gas in the cloud and the anisotropic optical depth distribution is purely a result of the anisotropy in the density distribution .",
    "specifically , we introduce a density gradient along the @xmath2 direction on top of an otherwise uniform cloud .",
    "the neutral hydrogen number density @xmath3 of the cloud is parameterized as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean number density in the cloud , @xmath6 is the cloud radius , and @xmath7 is a parameter denoting the magnitude of the density gradient .",
    "the column density from the cloud center follows a dipole distribution @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the angle with respect to the @xmath10 direction ( i.e. , the polar angle ) .",
    "the optical depth of photons depends not only on the density distribution but also on the velocity distribution .",
    "photons of the same frequency appear to have different frequency shifts in the restframe of atoms for atoms with different velocities in the lab frame ( i.e. , the doppler effect ) , which leads to different probability of interacting with the atoms ( i.e. , different scattering cross - section ) .",
    "therefore , for the second model , we consider a `` velocity gradient '' case , where the difference in optical depth along different directions is purely a result of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution . with a uniform density cloud that can undergo uniform hubble - like expansion / contraction",
    ", we introduce a velocity gradient along the @xmath2 direction , @xmath11 the first term on the right - hand side is the uniform hubble - like motion , and the second term represents the modification from the velocity gradient , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the unit vectors along @xmath14 and the @xmath10 directions , respectively . the quantity @xmath15 is the hubble velocity at the edge of the cloud and @xmath16 denotes the magnitude of the velocity gradient .",
    "a positive ( negative ) value of @xmath16 means that an additional outflow ( inflow ) field is added on both the @xmath10 and @xmath17 sides of the cloud .    finally , motivated by galactic wind",
    ", we consider a case named `` bipolar wind '' . for a cloud of uniform density",
    ", we set up a hubble - like velocity field within a limited solid angle , @xmath18 that is , the `` wind '' has a half open angle of @xmath19 around the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the model shares some similarity with the `` velocity gradient '' model .",
    "the differences are that here the velocity gradient is imposed along the radial direction ( not @xmath2 direction ) and the velocity field is confined to a cone .",
    "the geometry is similar to the model in @xcite .",
    "our models can be regarded as simplistic models of star - forming galaxies emitting photons with the cloud representing the cgm and igm environments . with the above models , we consider three cases of mean optical depth .",
    "this can be put in terms of a characteristic column density , @xmath20 .",
    "the three cases have @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , ranging from limit systems to damped systems .    for each setup , we perform the radiative transfer calculation of photons using a monte carlo code @xcite .",
    "photons are initially launched isotropically from the cloud center , with frequency following a gaussian profile centered at the rest - frame line - center frequency with the width determined by the temperature of the gas . for each run",
    ", we use @xmath24@xmath25 photons to obtain good statistics on fluxes and spectra .",
    "photons are collected once they reach the surface of the cloud .",
    "we define the angle @xmath26 as the polar angle of the escaped photon with respect to @xmath10 axis as seen by a distant observer . since this angle is the most observationally relevant one ( and since all three models are axial symmetric about the @xmath2 axis )",
    ", we focus our study on the emission properties as a function of @xmath26 . for describing the cloud configuration ( e.g. , density and velocity distribution ) , we use @xmath9 for the polar angle in the cloud s local frame , i.e. , the angle between a given radial direction and the @xmath10 axis .",
    "given the three types of models , different magnitudes of the density / velocity gradient , and different column densities , there are a large number of radiative transfer runs we perform . to obtain a basic picture of the anisotropic emission ,",
    "we start with the `` density gradient '' case with @xmath27 and introduce our analyses in flux and spectra .",
    "we then present the `` velocity gradient '' case with @xmath27 and the `` bipolar wind '' case .",
    "finally we discuss the general features in the anisotropic emission based on all the runs .",
    "we first study the anisotropic flux seen by distant observers .",
    "the flux at a polar angle @xmath26 is proportional to the number of photons @xmath29 in a narrow angular bin @xmath30 divided by the corresponding area @xmath31 for observers at distance @xmath32 . in what follows",
    ", we will normalize this flux to the isotropic flux @xmath33 .",
    "the normalized flux is then @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "it can also be put as the fractional photon count @xmath36 divided by the fractional area @xmath37 around the given polar angle .",
    "it satisfies the normalization condition @xmath38 .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : surfaceflux ] shows the angular dependence of the flux and the dependence on the magnitude of the density gradient ( with @xmath39 being the uniform sphere case ) .",
    "resonant scatterings of photons off neutral hydrogen atoms enable them to probe the optical depths along all directions , and they tend to preferentially make their way out along the path of least resistance . from our setup of the `` density gradient ''",
    "case ( equation  [ eqn : dengrad ] ) , the density decreases toward the @xmath10 direction . for photons at the cloud center ,",
    "the scattering optical depth is lowest ( highest ) along the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) direction .",
    "it can be clearly seen from the figure that photons favor escape along the @xmath40 direction and dislike escape along the @xmath41 direction .",
    "the ratio of fluxes at @xmath40 and at @xmath41 increases as we increase the density gradient , reaching a factor of about 2.5 for @xmath42 .    to quantify the anisotropy in the full range of the polar angle @xmath26 , we decompose the flux @xmath43 into its multipole components , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath46-th order legendre polynomial . the coefficient @xmath47 is solved from the orthogonality of the legendre polynomials , @xmath48 where @xmath49 corresponds to the direction of the @xmath50-th photon ( @xmath511 , 2 , ... ,",
    "@xmath52 ) .",
    "the rightmost expression reduces the integral to a simple sum over all photons .",
    "it is derived by making use of equation  [ eqn : f ] in the limit of infinitesimally small @xmath53 bin , and in such a limit , @xmath29 is either 1 or 0 .",
    "the monopole coefficient @xmath54 of @xmath43 is unity by definition .",
    "the density gradient introduces a dipole component in the density distribution ( and thus the initial optical depth distribution seen from the center ) .",
    "a corresponding dipole component in the flux shows up ( right panel of figure  [ fig : surfaceflux ] ) .",
    "however , since photons encounter a large number of scatterings and continually change their travel directions and frequencies before emerging at the surface , their final distribution does not follow the initial optical depth distribution . as a result ,",
    "higher multipole components emerge , and their relative contribution increases as the density gradient increases .",
    "because of the anisotropy , the observed flux depends on the viewing angle ( or observed direction ) .",
    "observers along different directions would infer different luminosities of the source ( assuming isotropic emission at the source ) .",
    "equivalently , for a given observer , observations of similar clouds at random orientations would give the distribution of the observed ( apparent ) luminosity .",
    "in figure  [ fig : ew ] , we show the distribution of the ratio of apparent luminosity @xmath55 to intrinsic luminosity @xmath56 as a function of density gradient magnitude .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 is calculated in the same way as @xmath43 in equation  [ eqn : f ] .",
    "the apparent luminosity is connected to the equivalent width ( ew ) of emission .",
    "if we neglect other contributions to ew , like dust effect on the continuum and emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observed emission being only a fraction of the total emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath57 is proportional to the ew",
    ". therefore , the anisotropic emission provides a mechanism for the distribution of ew .    to be specific and for the convenience of the comparison , here we neglect other contributions and assume that the intrinsic ew is 100 , corresponding to a stellar population with salpeter initial stellar mass function ( imf ) and 1/20 solar metallicity with age above 100myr @xcite .",
    "the top axis in each panel marks the resultant ew=@xmath58 .",
    "note that the @xmath57 ( ew ) distribution is computed based on the flux distribution shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : surfaceflux ] . to reduce the effect of noise in the flux distribution",
    ", we use the multipole expansion of the distribution up to to @xmath59 to derive the @xmath57 ( ew ) distribution shown in figure  [ fig : ew ] .    in the left panel of figure",
    "[ fig : ew ] , the original ew distributions from different runs are shown .",
    "if the cloud is uniform ( @xmath39 ) , the ew does not depend on viewing angle and we always have the intrinsic one ( i.e. , the distribution is just a dirac @xmath60 function ) . as the cloud becomes anisotropic , the viewing angle dependent emission makes the ew distribution extended .",
    "the distribution is skewed , with a higher amplitude at lower ew .",
    "the skewness increases as the anisotropy becomes stronger ( as a result of the larger density gradient ) , and at @xmath42 the distribution shows a prominent tail towards high ew values .",
    "interestingly , such a shape of the ew distribution is similar to the observed ones for laes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model ew distribution has sharp edges ( corresponding to the boundary of @xmath40 and @xmath61 ) , which are not seen in real observations . to make a better comparison , we need to take into account the uncertainties in measuring the ew in observation . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : ew ] , each distribution is smoothed with a gaussian kernel with standard deviation of 10 , roughly the size of the measurement errors in ew from observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the skewness seen in the left panel remains after smoothing , and for strong anisotropic cases , the ew distribution mimics those seen in observation .    besides the viewing angle dependent flux or apparent luminosity , the spectra",
    "are also affected by the system anisotropy . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] ,",
    "the normalized spectra observed from observers located on the @xmath10 ( @xmath40 or @xmath62 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath41 or @xmath63 ) directions for the @xmath64 case are compared .",
    "the spectra for the isotropic case ( @xmath39 ) is shown for reference .",
    "the bottom axis shows the frequency offset in units the doppler frequency @xmath65 , which corresponds to the frequency offset of a line - center photon ( with frequency @xmath66 ) seen by an atom moving with the most probable thermal velocity @xmath67 .",
    "the top axis marks the offset in velocity units . to escape a static medium ,",
    "photons need to shift either to the blue or red wing , where the optical depth is small .",
    "this results in a characteristic double - peak profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which applies to the spectra plotted here .",
    "the two opposite directions in the left panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] correspond to the directions of minimum and maximum column density . in general , photons that escape from a direction with a lower column density diffuse",
    "less in frequency space . as a consequence ,",
    "the separation of the two peaks is smaller and the width of each peak is narrower . in the right panel , the spectra in the @xmath40 direction",
    "are compared for the @xmath68 and @xmath64 cases .",
    "the @xmath64 case has the lower line - of - sight column density , which has narrower peaks with a closer separation .",
    "the spectra do not differ substantially from the uniform case ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the reason is that the column density modulation on top of the uniform case is only a factor of @xmath69 . even for the @xmath42 case ,",
    "the modulation is only a factor of three . because of the resonant scattering",
    ", photons can be thought to probe the optical depths in all the directions before escaping along the final direction .",
    "this also reduces the difference in the effective column densities experienced by photons escaping along different directions , leading to only small differences in the spectra .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : lspec ] shows the viewing angle dependence of two spectral features , the peak offset @xmath70 with respect to the restframe line center and the line width characterized by the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath71 . in order to reduce the effect of noise",
    ", a gaussian fit around the peak in each spectrum is made to determine the peak offset .",
    "both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are computed in ten bins of the viewing angle , with the bottom - left and upper - right points corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "we only show the case from the peak in the red side of the spectra  in reality , the blue peak likely becomes insignificant because of the scattering in the igm with hubble flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath39 case is shown to give a sense of the noise in our calculation of these quantities from the spectra .",
    "there is a clear correlation between @xmath70 and @xmath71  as photons diffuse more in the frequency space , the spectrum as a whole shifts further away from the initial line center and at the same time it becomes more broadened .",
    "since both the apparent luminosity and spectral features depend on viewing angle , there must exist correlations between them . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : lspec ] , we see that both the peak offset and width are anti - correlated with the luminosity ( or ew ) .",
    "this makes perfect sense  along a direction of easier escape , emission has a higher flux ( thus larger @xmath57 or ew ) , while photons diffuse less in frequency space ( thus smaller peak offset and width ) .    as a whole",
    ", the resonant scatterings experienced by photons constantly change their propagation directions .",
    "this enables the photons to probe optical depths along all directions , and they tend to escape from the directions with low optical depth . for the `` density gradient '' case , the anisotropic distribution in the column density of the cloud translates to anisotropic emission , i.e. , viewing angle dependent emission properties , such as the apparent luminosity , spectral peak offset , and peak width .",
    "the viewing angle dependent flux leads to a spread in ew , suggesting an interesting mechanism to produce the observed ew distribution .",
    "the emission properties are correlated as a result of the viewing angle dependence . in directions of lower resistance , photons tend to have higher flux and less diffusion in frequency space .",
    "following the detailed discussions of the `` density gradient '' case , we now turn to another anisotropic case by adding a velocity gradient to an otherwise static uniform sphere ( @xmath75 in equation  [ eqn : vgrad ] ) .",
    "the velocity gradient leads to anisotropy in the initial optical depth , and we expect the emission to depend on viewing angle as well . as an example , we present the results for the @xmath74 case .",
    "figure  [ fig : vel_obsflux ] shows the viewing angle dependence of the flux measured by distant observers ( left ) and the multipole decomposition ( right ) . the way we add the velocity gradient",
    "can be thought as hubble - like expansion in the @xmath76 directions and no expansion in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 directions . in the plot , @xmath16 ( taking the values of 50 , 100 , and 200 @xmath79 )",
    "is the radial velocity at the edge of the cloud along @xmath76 directions . for such expansion velocities ,",
    "the initial photons launched at the center are effectively at a single frequency ( the restframe line - center frequency ) . in the restframe of the atoms in the expanding cloud",
    ", these initial photons appear to be redshifted off the line center , with a frequency shift proportional to the radial velocity . with our setup ,",
    "the optical depth seen by the initial photons appears low towards the @xmath40 and @xmath61 directions ( poles ) and high towards the @xmath80 directions ( equator ) .",
    "therefore , unlike the `` density gradient '' case , here we have a quadrupole - like distribution of the initial optical depth .",
    "given such a distribution of optical depth , it is expected that photons prefer to escape towards the poles rather than the equator , as seen in the left panel of figure  [ fig : vel_obsflux ] .",
    "the ratio of the maximum to minimum fluxes increases from about two for @xmath81 to about four for @xmath82 .",
    "a strong quadrupole component in the angular distribution of flux emerges ( right panel of figure  [ fig : vel_obsflux ] ) , which increases as @xmath16 increases .",
    "unlike the `` density gradient '' case , there is no dipole component from the symmetry of the system .",
    "nevertheless , the density and velocity gradient cases share the same effect on emission ",
    "anisotropy in the initial optical depth leads to anisotropy in the flux .",
    "similar to the `` density gradient '' case , the anisotropic emission leads to a skewed distribution of apparent luminosity ( @xmath57 or ew ) with a tail of high values ( see figure  [ fig : vel_ew ] , left for the original distributions and right for the ones smoothed with a gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 10 ) . for @xmath16=100@xmath83 and 200@xmath83 ,",
    "the shape of the smoothed distribution looks similar to the observed ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : vel_spec ] shows the spectra of photons escaping from the directions of the pole and equator as a function of the velocity gradient ( parameterized by the velocity @xmath16 at the edge of the cloud ) . while the spectra in the `` velocity gradient '' case still have two peaks , they are no longer symmetric about the initial line center ( figure  [ fig : vel_spec ] ) .",
    "blue photons would be redshifted close to the line center in the restframe of hydrogen atoms in an expanding cloud and be strongly scattered .",
    "that is , photons tend to shift redward for an easy escape from the cloud .",
    "overall , the blue peak is suppressed compared to the red peak .",
    "the generic features of the spectra can be understood following the interpretations in e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , by accounting for the anistropy .",
    "since both the density and velocity affect the frequency diffusion in the `` velocity gradient '' case , the relatively tight correlation between the peak position and peak fwhm seen in the `` density gradient '' case becomes weaker ( left panel of figure  [ fig : vel_lspec ] ) .",
    "so does the correlation between apparent luminosity @xmath57 ( or ew ) and fwhm ( lower points in the right panel ) .",
    "however , the tight anti - correlation between @xmath57 ( ew ) and peak position @xmath70 persists ( big symbols in the right panel ) .",
    "this anti - correlation appears to be much stronger than that in the `` density gradient '' case ( figure  [ fig : lspec ] ) .    to summarize , for `` velocity gradient '' induced optical depth anisotropy , emission again displays the corresponding anisotropy in flux and spectral features .",
    "the apparent luminosity or ew distribution closely resembles the observed ones . as an extension",
    ", we also study systems with `` velocity gradient '' in one direction imposed on top of an isotropic hubble - like expansion , and the relation between ew and @xmath70 is similar to the `` velocity gradient '' cases shown here .",
    "the results for the extended cases will be presented in ",
    "[ sec : general ] .      before discussing general properties of anisotropic emission",
    ", we briefly present the results on the flux anisotropy for the `` bipolar wind '' case . in this case",
    ", the uniform cloud has a hubble - like expansion within a cone defined by @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) . and remains static outside of the cone .",
    "that is , half of the cloud gas is expanding .",
    "the expansion velocity at the edge of the cloud is set to be 200@xmath83 .",
    "this specific setup is motivated by the bipolar outflow from galaxies .",
    "we perform runs for three column densities : @xmath87 , @xmath22 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the optical depth is determined by both the column density and velocity . for initial photons with frequency @xmath89 ,",
    "the radial optical depth is @xmath90 dr \\nonumber\\\\       & = & nr \\int_0 ^ 1 \\sigma\\left[\\nu_i(1-s\\delta v / c)\\right ] ds,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the scattering cross - section .",
    "the equation applies to the regions both with and without outflow ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "since all the three runs have the same velocity fields , from the above equation we see that the above three runs have the same fractional anisotropy in the initial optical depth and they differ in the overall optical depth scale ( which is set by the column density ) .",
    "the `` bipolar wind '' case shares some similarities with the `` velocity gradient '' case ; the main differences are that its velocity field is radially oriented ( rather than only in @xmath76 direction ) and is only within a limited region ( rather than the whole cloud ) . as a consequence , the results on the flux anisotropy , apparent luminosity distribution , and anisotropic spectral properties are also similar to the `` velocity gradient '' case . for brevity ,",
    "we only present the flux anisotropy here and have other properties incorporated into the summary of the general results (   [ sec : general ] ) .    given the system setup",
    ", the anisotropy in the emission ( figure  [ fig : bi_obsflux ] ) mainly has a quadrupole component . as the column density increases , photons experience more scatterings and more changes in travel directions .",
    "the anisotropy in the initial optical depth is therefore becomes less important , and as a consequence the anisotropy in flux becomes weaker .      with the three cases discussed in the previous subsections , we turn to present the general results and make an attempt to further connect to observations .",
    "a few more model runs are included here .",
    "we extend the `` velocity gradient '' case by imposing a velocity gradient along the @xmath2 direction on top of a spherical cloud with hubble - like expansion ( see equation  [ eqn : vgrad ] ) .",
    "the hubble - like expansion has a velocity @xmath95 at the edge of the cloud and we impose different velocity gradients with the parameter @xmath16 ranging from -100 to 100@xmath83 with a step size 50@xmath83 .",
    "we also perform runs with different column densities ( @xmath87 , @xmath22 , and @xmath96 ) for the `` density gradient '' case and the `` velocity gradient '' case and its extension . in total , the results of 32 runs from all the cases are presented here .",
    "overall , we find system anisotropy leads to anisotropies in emission .",
    "the observed luminosity depends on the viewing angle .",
    "since higher luminosities are likely observed along directions of easier escape , we expect the luminosity to show a correlation with the optical depth of the same direction .",
    "however , we do not expect the correlation to be tight .",
    "photons probe the optical depth in all directions in a convoluted way , since their scattering with the neutral hydrogen atoms causes their positions , directions , and frequencies to continually change .",
    "furthermore , for observed / apparent luminosity , the absolute value of optical depth is not a good indicator . as an example , consider the uniform sphere case .",
    "for the same intrinsic luminosity , spheres of different column density ( optical depth ) have the same observed luminosity , since all photons escape .",
    "correction to the initial spectra is not the right way to do the radiative transfer , where @xmath97 is the frequency dependent optical depth along the line - of - sight direction .",
    "this is demonstrated and emphasized in @xcite . ]",
    "a better quantity that connects to luminosity could be the relative optical depth among all directions .    in figure",

    "@xmath99 is the initial line - center optical depth for photons and @xmath100 is the average over all directions . or equivalently we can define the fractional excess @xmath101 in the initial line - center optical depth .",
    "the three curves are shown in the form of @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 to guide the eye .",
    "clearly there exists an overall correlation between apparent luminosity ( or ew ) and the relative line - center optical depth .",
    "the plot serves as a nice summary of the anisotropic emission from all the models considered in this paper .",
    "it depicts the idea that photons prefer to escape along the direction of least resistance .",
    "the resonant scatterings allow photons to probe optical depth along different directions , and the key quantity that determines the final anisotropic distribution of emission is the relative optical depth , not the absolute one .    as a result of the anisotropy ,",
    "the observed luminosity from a set of randomly oriented clouds will spread out around the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : ews ] summarizes the distributions of the apparent luminosity ( ew ) by showing the result from a few selected models .",
    "the apparent luminosity / ew distribution is largely determined by the anisotropy ( in the initial optical depth ) of the system . for a fixed anisotropy factor ( e.g. , density or velocity gradient )",
    ", a cloud with higher column density has a lower degree of anisotropy in the initial optical depth distribution .",
    "this translates to smaller spread in the apparent luminosity / ew distribution ( e.g. , comparing the @xmath105 cases with those of @xmath106 ) .",
    "the anisotropy leads to a skewed ew distribution with a tail toward higher values .",
    "it becomes more skewed with higher degrees of flux anisotropy ( i.e. , lower column density ) . for the high column density `` bipolar wind '' case , a low amplitude bump is seen at higher ew values . for this model , the superposition of the ew distributions from systems with different column densities ( more abundant for lower column density ) can produce a distribution with an extended tail .",
    "the skewed ew distribution looks similar to the observed ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implies that anisotrpic emission provides one mechanism to contribute to the ew distribution .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : ew_vpeak ] summarizes the relation between ew ( or the apparent luminosity @xmath57 ) and the shift in the ( red ) peak of the line .",
    "the points are clearly grouped according to the column density ( triangles , squares , and circles for @xmath87 , @xmath22 , and @xmath88 , respectively ) , with larger peak shift at higher column density . for the sequence at a fixed column density , the spread in the ew distribution results from the dependence on the viewing angle .",
    "the size of the symbols indicates the magnitude of the anisotropy of the system , with larger symbols for higher anisotropy .    for the `` density gradient '' case ( black points ) ,",
    "the anti - correlation between ew and @xmath70 is stronger at higher column density , but overall the anti - correlation is weak .",
    "the offset in the peak position is largely determined by the column density . at fixed column density",
    ", a cloud with a low anisotropy in the initial optical depth ( indicated by smaller symbols ) has a smaller spread in the apparent luminosity / ew distribution viewed from different directions , which is expected .    for the `` velocity gradient '' case ( magenta points ) ,",
    "a similar trend of increasing strength of ew-@xmath70 anti - correlation with increasing column density is found , but the anti - correlation is much stronger than the `` density gradient '' case . at fixed velocity gradient",
    ", a higher column density means a lower degree of system anisotropy , and therefore we see a smaller spread . at fixed column density , a smaller velocity gradient ( indicated by smaller symbols )",
    "also means a lower degree of system anisotropy , leading to smaller spread in ew .",
    "the extended `` velocity gradient '' case ( red points ) closely follows the above results , with filled ( open ) symbols for imposing positive ( negative ) velocity gradients .",
    "similar results are also found for the `` bipolar wind '' case ( blue symbols ) .",
    "as a whole , for the runs we have performed , the line peak offset is mainly driven by the column density , with larger offset from systems of higher column density .",
    "the overall trend seen in the left panel of figure  [ fig : ew_vpeak ] from all the cases we consider is that the spread in ew distribution decreases with increasing line peak offset .",
    "interestingly the above trend appears to be consistent with recent observations . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : ew_vpeak ] , we reproduce the data points compiled and analyzed by @xcite for laes , blobs ( labs ) , and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "the ew can be measured from the line luminosity and continuum with narrow - band and broad - band photometry . to determine the peak offset ,",
    "the systemic redshifts of the galaxies are measured from nebular emission lines such h@xmath107 .",
    "even though @xcite cast their result as an anti - correlation between ew and @xmath70 , the plot suggests a smaller ew spread towards larger peak offset .",
    "we emphasize that we do not intend to fit the observation here , since our models are simplistic .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging to see that both the ranges of ew and @xmath70 and their relation fall into the ballpark of the observational results .",
    "it suggests that the key element in our simple models ( i.e. , emission from anisotropic systems ) could play an important role in shaping the emission in real systems .",
    "more realistic models ( e.g. , those based on galaxy formation simulations ) are necessary for a better understanding and comparison with the observation .    to study the ew@xmath70 relation observationally , the quantity @xmath70 is the more difficult one to measure .",
    "the reason is that a line indicating the systemic redshift of the galaxy is needed .",
    "examples of such lines are h@xmath107 and [ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which shift to infrared for high redshift galaxies . it would be interesting to see whether there are other possible ways that can inform us about @xmath70 , without the knowledge of the systemic redshift . based on our results ,",
    "we see a general correlation between @xmath70 and the fwhm @xmath71 , mainly driven by the column density .",
    "the degree of correlation varies from case to case , which leads to a large scatter among cases with different anisotropy setups .",
    "we investigate whether other spectral features of the line can help to reduce the scatter .",
    "besides line peak offset and the fwhm of the line , another obvious property of the line is its asymmetry . both from observation and from our model , the red peak of the line",
    "is usually asymmetric , having a red tail .",
    "we therefore can introduce an asymmetry parameter .",
    "it can be defined by comparing the line fluxes or widths blueward and redward of the line peak ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we define it as three times the ratio of the widths at half maximum at the blue and red sides of the peak , @xmath108 . by introducing this parameter",
    ", we find a relatively tight correlation between @xmath70 and @xmath109 ( see figure  [ fig : vv ] ) , probably with the low @xmath70 part of the `` bipolar wind '' model causing the largest scatter .",
    "note that both @xmath71 and @xmath110 can be inferred from the spectra .",
    "observationally , @xcite show a possible trend of increasing line asymmetry with increasing peak offset",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the correlation seen in our study holds for realistic models and whether observations support it .",
    "note that for a fair comparison with observations , the spectral resolution needs to be taken into account .",
    "its effect is to smooth the line and increase both the fwhm and the asymmetry parameter , which would cause a slope change for the correlation in figure  [ fig : vv ] . in any case ,",
    "a correlation of similar type to ours or with similar spirit is worth pursuing",
    ". it can not only provide a way to determine the peak offset without knowing the systemic redshift , but also serve as a relation to test theoretical models of environments of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we perform a theoretical investigation of the effect of anisotropy in neutral hydrogen systems on the observed properties of emission . the motivation of the work is to help understand the relation between the gas environment around star - forming galaxies and emission properties and yield insights on using the latter to probe the former .",
    "we find that the anisotropy in the spatial and kinematic distributions of neutral hydrogen can play an important role in shaping the observed emission properties from star - forming galaxies .",
    "we consider simple configurations of neutral hydrogen systems of spherical clouds with a central point source of emission .",
    "we set up system anisotropy induced by different factors .",
    "the term `` system anisotropy '' refers to the anisotropy in the initial optical depth of photons .",
    "since the scattering optical depth of photons depends on both density and velocity , we basically explore anisotropies induced by two types of causes .",
    "the first type is density - caused and a `` density gradient '' is applied to the cloud along one direction .",
    "the second type is velocity - caused .",
    "for the `` velocity gradient '' case , we apply a velocity gradient along one direction to the otherwise static cloud .",
    "its extension , the `` expansion plus velocity gradient '' case , has an additional , isotropic hubble - like expansion .",
    "the `` bipolar wind '' case , which has a spatially separated outflowing region , also belongs to this velocity - caused category .",
    "for each case , we set up systems of different column densities and of different degrees of anisotropy .",
    "we perform monte carlo radiative transfer calculations to obtain the emission escaping from the clouds and study the anisotropy in flux and spectral features .",
    "owing to the resonant scatterings with neutral hydrogen atoms , a photon takes a random walk in a cloud , with its traveling direction and frequency constantly changing .",
    "such a random walk enables the photon to explore the optical depths along different directions .",
    "it tends to escape along the directions of low resistance .",
    "an initial anisotropy in scattering optical depth therefore translates to the anisotropy in the escaping emission .",
    "it is not surprising that a dipole ( quadrupole ) component in flux ( or apparent luminosity ) is found for a dipole ( quadrupole ) component in the system optical depth anisotropy . roughly speaking ,",
    "the flux in a direction is determined by the optical depth along that direction _ relative _ to those along other directions , or by the fractional excess of the initial optical depth .    for an ensemble of the same systems with random orientations ,",
    "the anisotropic emission gives rise to a non - trivial distribution in the observed / apparent luminosity or the ew .",
    "the general ew distributions from our models are found to be skewed with a tail towards high ew values .",
    "such distributions , especially the ones from the `` density gradient '' and `` velocity gradient '' cases , resemble the observed ones for laes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed ew distribution is likely a superposition of systems of a variety of environments . given the generic features seen in our models , a superposition of ew distributions from models with different types of anisotropy , different degrees of anisotropy , and different column densities will still keep the skewed shape and resemble the observed distributions .",
    "even though our models are idealized and hardly realistic , our results suggest that the viewing angle dependent emission caused by system anisotropy can be an important factor in contributing to the ew distribution of laes .",
    "spectra are also subjected to the anisotropic effect .",
    "noticeably for a given system , the offset of the line peak depends on the viewing angle .",
    "photons escaping from the directions of low optical depths typically have a spectrum with a smaller peak offset from the line center .",
    "the overall scale of the offset depends strongly on the mean column density of the cloud .",
    "the viewing angle dependence of both the apparent luminosity ( ew ) and peak offset cause an anti - correlation between the two quantities for a given cloud  along the direction that is easy to escape , we have a higher flux ( apparent luminosity ) and photons diffuse less in frequency space .",
    "we note that the peak offset is not necessarily a feature specific to the anisotropic systems we study , and it can also occur in isotropic systems . in such systems ,",
    "the peak offset increases with increasing system column density or optical depth .",
    "however , for isotropic clouds with a given intrinsic luminosity @xmath56 , the apparent luminosity @xmath111 , which is independent of the column density .",
    "therefore , the anti - correlation between peak offset and luminosity ( ew ) we find in the anisotropic systems can not be naturally produced by the isotropic systems , unless with the effect of dust invoked or with a contrived scenario of putting more luminous sources in systems of lower column densities .    for a fixed magnitude of the anisotropy factor ( e.g. , density or velocity gradient ) ,",
    "the system anisotropy becomes weaker at higher column density . from the viewing angle dependence of luminosity or ew at fixed column density and the dependence of the peak offset on column density",
    ", we find that at larger peak offset the spread in the apparent luminosity or ew is reduced .",
    "interestingly this generic feature between ew and peak offset in the model anisotropic emission is seen in the observational data in @xcite , suggesting that anisotropic emission can be at work in real emitting systems .",
    "based on our simple models , we also find a correlation between the line peak offset and line shape ( i.e. , some combination of the fwhm and asymmetry of the line ) .",
    "an observational test of this correlation could help us understand radiative transfer in real systems by comparing model predictions and observations .",
    "conversely , a similar kind of relation between peak offset and spectral shape established from observation , if possible , would provide opportunities for us to learn about the density / velocity structures or , more generally , the environment around emitting systems that shapes the emission properties . additionally , this type of correlation has the potential use of determining the systemic redshift of galaxies with the emission line alone .",
    "our investigation based on analytic models suggests that anisotropies in the spatial and kinematic distributions of neutral hydrogen in the cgm and igm can be an important ingredient in determining the properties of observed emission .",
    "while we try to build models that capture some features in the cgm and igm around star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , density inhomogeneity and outflow ) , they are simplistic and by no means realistic .",
    "a further study along this path is to apply similar analyses to galaxies in high resolution cosmological galaxy formation simulations .",
    "if the relations found in this paper turn out to exist for simulated galaxies , we expect the scatter to be large given the more complex environment around galaxies .",
    "in fact , some of the features found in our study are broadly similar to those from studies of individual simulated galaxies . for example",
    ", the viewing angle dependent flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , correlation of flux with the initial optical depth ( e.g. , figure 11 in @xcite ) , and the relation between peak shift and flux ( e.g. , figure 9 in @xcite ) . compared to the results from our simple models , the viewing angle dependent flux in the above study",
    "does show much larger spread , an expected consequence of the more complex density and velocity distribution of the gas around galaxies .",
    "one can certainly extend our simple models to more complicated models , with more realistic geometry and coupling between density and velocity , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "indeed , models with various setups start to be studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given what we have learned from the simple models , a complementary route is to continue the investigation with high - resolution simulated galaxies . a large ensemble of high - resolution simulated galaxies are necessary for a statistical study , and we reserve such an investigation for future work .",
    "from the results and analyses we present in this paper , we expect that a more detailed study with simulated galaxies will greatly advance our understanding of the interactions between emission and cgm / igm and of galaxy formation through the cgm / igm environment probed by emission .",
