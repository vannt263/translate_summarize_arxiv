    "in quantum mechanics , the correlation of physical observables can obey some constraints expressed in terms of inequalities .",
    "for example , the correlations of position and momentum of a particle provide the lower bound for the product of the uncertainties of these two quantities as given by the schrdinger  robertson uncertainty relation  @xcite .",
    "for discrete variables like spins , the quantum correlations for entangled states , e.g. , of two qubits , also provide some inequalities known as cirelson s bound  @xcite @xmath0 , which differs for similar chsh ",
    "bell bound 2  @xcite associated with classical correlations typical for separable states of two qubits .    in principle",
    ", the existence of bounds of this kind can be checked experimentally .",
    "the violation of bell s inequalities , that is the violation of the bound of bell s number 2 , was indeed proved experimentally ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "statistical characteristics as means , dispersions , correlations for quantum observables can easily be formulated in the probability representation of quantum mechanics ( see , recent review  @xcite ) . this representation for spins",
    "was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the quantum states in the probability representation are described by fair measurable probability distributions ( called tomograms ) , which contain complete information on density operators of the states . in view of the possibility to use the standard formulae of classical probability theory in the probability representation for quantum - mechanical calculations with tomograms",
    ", there might exist some advantages to better understand the role of quantum correlations and of the corresponding quantum bounds for separable and entangled states , if one uses the tomographic - probability approach .",
    "our goal in this paper is to investigate the existence of nonclassical correlations in selected two - qutrits states through bell s number @xmath1 using the tomographic approach .",
    "quantum states are usually described in the canonical quantum picture by vectors in a complex hilbert space or by density operators , describing pure and mixed states respectively . together with the usual schrdinger and heisenberg picture there",
    "exist another possible picture of quantum mechanics called tomographic picture @xcite , where a quantum state is described by a quantity called _ tomogram_. by definition a tomogram is a positive measurable probability distribution function of random variables .",
    "it has been shown that all the physical properties of a quantum system in a given state can be studied in terms of its associated tomogram , which then contains the same amount of information as the density matrix of the state . +",
    "although the approach based on tomograms and the one based on density matrices are equivalent , it is worth noting two main conceptual differences between these two methods : first of all in the tomographic picture one works only with classical probability distribution related to relative frequencies of measures .",
    "another difference lies in the fact that the construction of a tomogram requires additional information about some selected observables in a given experimental setup .",
    "+ in the tomographic approach the observables are no longer described by operators : they are now associated with functions .",
    "the quantization scheme is then based on a star product of functions @xcite . +",
    "this probability representation of quantum mechanics provides us with a useful way for analyzing the existence of non local correlations in quantum states of qudits by the use of the so called _ qubit portrait _ @xcite .",
    "this method belongs to the class of entanglement - detecting methods based on linear maps .",
    "a qubit portrait is indeed a linear map defined in the tomographic description of quantum states .",
    "such a map constructs a fictious qubit - state associated with the starting qudit - state .",
    "this construction is needed because bell s inequality are defined only for systems described by dichotomic variables .",
    "+ in the following chapters this method will be applied to check bell s inequalities in two classes of quantum states .",
    "we know from bell s theorem  @xcite that the existence of nonclassical correlations is given by a violation of the inequality @xmath2 using the qubit - portrait method it has been shown @xcite that the bell s number for the maximally entangled state of two qutrits @xmath3 can take values greater than 2 , for example being @xmath4 .",
    "in this letter we aim at extending such a result by applying the tomographic method to the following two classes of entangled states @xmath5 where the real parameters vary in the ranges @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] .      in order to apply the tomographic method to a quantum state , first of all we need to specify the associated density matrix . for our state , this matrix , expressed in the standard basis @xmath9 , is denoted by @xmath10 and has the following explicit form : + @xmath11 to obtain the tomogram associated with @xmath10  @xcite , we must evaluate the nine diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath12 expressing the density operator @xmath10 after a generic rotation of the cartesian reference frame , paramatrized in terms of euler angles .",
    "to this end we start by reminding that the matrix rotating the density operator of a single qutrit may be cast in the form + @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denote the three euler angles @xcite . hence the rotation matrix to be used to rotate",
    "our two - qutrits state @xmath10 is @xmath17 where the pedix 1 ( 2 ) refers to the qutrit @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "evaluating all the nine diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath20 one obtains the following nine - component probability vector @xmath21 called tomogram of the state @xmath10 .",
    "we notice that @xmath22 is independent on @xmath16 due to the specific form of @xmath10 .",
    "+ to characterize a state through this tomogram amounts at describing it using the density - matrix formalism .",
    "nevertheless , if we want to check the bell s inequality , it is easier to start from the tomogram of the state since it allows a systematic construction of a new representation mimising a qubit tomogram called qubit portrait  @xcite . in practice starting from our nine - component probability vector @xmath22",
    "we define the following new four - component tomogram @xmath23 where in accordance with @xcite we put @xmath24 @xmath25 represents the tomogram of a quantum state of a fictious two - qubit system .",
    "this mapping procedure qutrit @xmath26 qubit provides the way to construct the bell s number of our original state @xmath10 .",
    "+ from an experimental point of view to check the bell s number of a two qubit system we must fix for each qubit in a generic way two orientations of our measuring apparatus . in this way we perform two measurements for each qubit .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) the orientations of the apparatus corresponding to the measurements performed on qubit 1 ( 2 ) . to construct the expression of @xmath1 for our state @xmath10",
    "it is useful to introduce the @xmath31 matrix @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a @xmath34 column vector obtained from the vector @xmath25 by formally assigning to the angle variables @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 the generic but fixed values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the bell s number of our original state @xmath10 can then be expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the polarization matrix defined as @xmath46 it is worthnoting that @xmath1 is a function of the eight angles @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 so that we can look for a violation of bell s inequality by maximizing @xmath1 with respect to such eight parameters .",
    "the result of such a maximization is still a function of the state parameter @xmath55 . due to the mathematical difficulties of such a procedure",
    ", we have to resort to a numerical maximization .",
    "the function of @xmath55 obtained in this way is shown in fig .  1",
    ".     state , where @xmath55 is on the abscissa the numerical maximization , which gives the bell s number , is on the ordinate . ]",
    "+ it is obvious that the bell s inequality is violated in the whole range of variability of the parameter @xmath55 .",
    "hence in our state nonclassical correlations are present no matter which value we give to the phase parameter .",
    "next , we investigate the existence of nonclassical correlations in the two - parameter normalized state @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "we follow the same method used in the previous paragraph immediately representing @xmath59 as follows :    @xmath60     + once again we have to rotate this density matrix exploiting @xmath61 and then taking the diagonal elements of this rotated matrix @xmath62 in order to construct the tomogram @xmath63 of our state @xmath64 . proceeding as in the previous section , we consider a qubit - portrait of our qutrit state in the same way as we did for the @xmath8 state . using equations  ( 10 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath65 proceeding with the method exposed above , after a numerical maximization on the set @xmath66 , we obtain a function of two parameters @xmath55 and @xmath67 .    once again an analytical approach is quite complicated and hence after a numerical treatment we plot this function of both parameters getting the surface presented in fig .  2 .",
    "state plotted against the two parameters @xmath55 and @xmath67 . ]",
    "+ the most striking feature of this figure is the presence of domains in the @xmath68-plane where a sudden change in the value of bell s number occurs .",
    "in particular , we notice the existence of a domain around the point @xmath69 where the bell s number goes down to a value around 2 . in order to see this behaviour in more detail we report in fig.3 the bell s number of our state against @xmath67 keeping @xmath55 fixed at @xmath70 .",
    "state plotted against the parameter @xmath67 when @xmath55 is fixed at the value @xmath71 . ]     + this graph clearly shows the existence of domains in which the bell s number of our state crosses the critical value 2 .",
    "for example keeping @xmath67 and @xmath55 fixed at values @xmath72 it is possible to proceed with an exact maximization of the bell s number which gives the result @xmath73 .",
    "this means that the state satisfies the bell s inequality in that point .",
    "this anomalous behaviour may be due to many effects .",
    "first of all , it could just be an effect of our numerical approach to the problem or it could mean that our choice of the qubit portrait is no longer correct in this domain of the parameter space , and we should test the value of bell s number for every other possible qubit portraits .",
    "however , any other choice in our qubit portrait we tested gives a similar result .",
    "if this behaviour is not due to numerical maximization problems or to unfortunate choices of qubit maps , this could mean that our state undergoes a transition from the condition in which nonclassical correlations are present to a condition in which the only correlations present in the state are of a classical kind .",
    "if this is the case then there exists a critical value of the parameter @xmath67 at which this transition takes place .",
    "it is of interest to observe that the time - dependent state @xmath74 is such to span progressively and periodically all the states in the class @xmath75 \\}$ ] . as a consequence it evolves from the initial condition @xmath76 in such a way that when @xmath77 the bell s number is less than 2 . to exploit the properties exhibited by @xmath78",
    "thus one might wonder whether an hamiltonian @xmath79 exists such that @xmath80 satisfies the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath81 to this end consider the hamiltonian @xmath82.\\ ] ] when the coupling constant @xmath83 has the form @xmath84 and @xmath85 is an arbitrarily assigned energy .",

    "+ it is not difficult to convince oneself that starting from ( 19 ) other examples of hamiltonians such that @xmath91 satisfies eq . (",
    "18 ) may be constructed .",
    "+   + recently a new method has been proposed to investigate the presence of quantum correlations in a given quantum state  @xcite .",
    "this approach suggests to use the non - negative quantity @xmath92 to characterize the existence of nonclassical correlations in the state of a quantum bipartite system . here",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath1 are meant to be the two subsystems , @xmath94 is the quantum mutual information and @xmath95 is the maximum classical mutual information over all possible choices of local measurements .",
    "the interesting property is that the function @xmath96 vanishes only for states wherein the only correlations are classical .",
    "nevertheless , from a practical point of view , the maximization involved in the evaluation of @xmath95 is often quite complicated . indeed ,",
    "classical mutual information @xmath97 , depending strongly on the choice of measurement strategies , should be maximized over every possible povm .",
    "one route toward the resolution of this problem is to confine to projective measures only ; this , in turn , allows the evaluation of the quantity @xmath98 which is meant to surrogate @xmath96 .",
    "since , indeed , the set of projective measures is just a subset of all povm , we must have @xmath99 whether @xmath100 may help to extract definitive replies on the existence of quantum correlations in a bipartite system in a given quantum state is still an open problem .",
    "we note indeed that when the function @xmath100 is positive , we are not able , in general , to give a definitive answer on the presence of quantum correlations since , in this case , we do not know anything about the positivity of @xmath96 .",
    "only when @xmath100 vanishes , we can state with certainty that @xmath101 which , in turn , means the existence of only classical correlations .",
    "when applied to the @xmath56 state we get @xmath100 depending only on @xmath67 and this result is shown in fig .  4 .",
    "since the class @xmath8 coincides with @xmath102 , we immediately see that @xmath100 in this latter case assumes a constant and positive value deducible from fig.4 .     for the @xmath56 state plotted against the parameter @xmath67 . ]",
    "+ hence we see that , for the two - parameter state we are considering , the @xmath100 function can not reproduce the result we obtained with our tomographic method when the parameter @xmath67 crosses its critical value around 0.9 . in the case we are considering ,",
    "the method reported in @xcite is not able to give any useful answer concerning the presence of quantum correlations .    on the contrary ,",
    "the tomographic method we applied is a more powerful tool of analysis for the state we studied .",
    "indeed , the tomographic approach allows us to give definitive replies about the existence of quantum correlations in a wide range of the parameter domain where the bell s number is greater than @xmath103 .",
    "we have examined a class of one - parameter two qutrits state using the tomographic approach showing without any doubt the existence of non - classical correlations in all the domain of the parameter .",
    "+ we have also studied a class of two - parameter states of two qutrits finding almost everywhere in the domain of the two parameters non - classical correlations .",
    "we find in this class also examples of states which might be compatible with the bell s inequalities .",
    "this fact suggests the possibility of a passage from states exibiting non - classical correlations to states dominated by classical correlations only at the transition point @xmath104 when @xmath67 is varied and @xmath55 is kept at its value @xmath105 .",
    "+ in view of such a property we have demonstrated that the sub - class @xmath75 \\}$ ] may be dynamically generated and the relevant time dependent hamiltonian accomplishing this target is explicitly given .",
    "+ the comparison with another available method  @xcite for studying nonclassical correlations of two - qutrit system shows that the tomographic approach provides a tool to detect some peculiarities of the correlations which are not detected by using mutual information of bipartite system .",
