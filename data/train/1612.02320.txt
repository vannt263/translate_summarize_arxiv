    "massive mimo @xcite is an emerging wireless communication technique that promises substantial gains in both spectral and energy efficiency compared to traditional cellular systems .",
    "one feature of mami is its robustness to hardware imperfections @xcite , which implies that using mami will result in improved cost and energy efficiency .",
    "this fact has inspired a flurry of research activity focusing on diverse aspects of hardware impairments in mami and specific signaling and signal processing design tailored with the effects of the impairments in mind - all with the common goal of further improving the efficiency of the system .",
    "a significant body of this research aims at analyzing and fine - tuning mami - based systems using adcs with low resolution @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the motivation for such investigations is well - established : the power consumption of adcs grows at least linearly with sampling rate @xcite and will prove to be a power consumption bottleneck in systems with very large bandwidths .",
    "therefore , there is a huge interest in reducing the power consumption of adcs by reducing the bit resolution as much as possible .",
    "however , it is not perfectly clear whether choosing adcs with extremely low resolutions will be beneficial from energy efficiency point of view , and analyses of this problem appear scarce . only some very recent results @xcite , @xcite seem to indicate that very low bit resolutions are not optimal in energy efficiency sense .",
    "the analysis in this contribution aims at providing an insight in how the overall energy efficiency of a mami system - specifically , mami uplink - behaves when the adc resolution is changed .",
    "the total power consumption of mami base station is parameterized , so that the analysis covers a wide variety of system architectures - from very economical to very power - hungry . also , the adc power consumption model that is used attempts to reflect the functional dependencies that are found in actual adc designs and as such aims to be close to hardware design reality .",
    "energy efficiency of a base station ( bs ) receiver in the uplink of a mami system is defined as @xmath0 , \\label{eq : energy_efficiency}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 $ ] being the uplink sumrate and @xmath2 $ ] total power consumption of the mami bs ( adcs together with all other receiver blocks , analog and digital ) .",
    "dependencies of sumrate and power consumption on adc bit resolution @xmath3 need to be resolved separately . to this end",
    ", we first turn to finding an appropriate model for the impact of adcs on system performance .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     power consumption of the blocks excluding adcs , denoted by @xmath4 , is normalized by @xmath5 - power consumption of adcs across all rf chains at an arbitrary bit resolution @xmath6",
    ". total power consumption of the bs in the uplink can therefore be expressed as @xmath7 where the quantity @xmath8 is referred to as the _ architecture factor_. introduction of the architecture factor helps tie together the power consumption of the adcs and remaining receiver blocks : moreover , it allows for a parameterized analysis that covers a wide range of system architectures .",
    "the aim of this contribution was to provide an initial overview of the energy efficiency trends as various system parameters change . to provide this initial insight ,",
    "system performance simulations have been performed across a wide variety of system parameters .    alongside primary system parameter @xmath3 ,",
    "several other important system parameters have been considered , namely @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and preprocessing @xmath13 ( defined with large - scale fading normalized to the level of thermal noise ) . in order to reduce the dimensionality of the analysis ,",
    "two auxiliary system parameters have been introduced , namely _ spatial loading _ ( @xmath14 ) and _ temporal loading _ ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in addition to all the assumptions on system setup listed before , it was assumed that perfect power control was performed in the uplink ( so all @xmath16 ) . in all the analyses , reference bit resolution @xmath17 was set to 2 .",
    "for the first set of results , @xmath18 and @xmath19 were swept together with @xmath3 .",
    "additionally , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_snr_sweep ] .",
    "optimal energy efficiency points are denoted by the circular marker .",
    "results indicate that , as power consumption of adcs becomes comparable to power consumption of all the other blocks , from energy efficiency point of view it is beneficial to use lower bit resolution . however , in practical system designs it is reasonable to expect that adc power consumption is only a small fraction of the total power consumption when adc resolution is low .    just to provide an illustrative example ,",
    "bs power model presented in @xcite was used with the parameters listed above ( additionally , system bandwidth was assumed to be 20 mhz ) and yielded @xmath24 . on the other hand , at @xmath25 , using a correction factor @xmath26 , the adc power consumption model described above gave @xmath27 , resulting in @xmath28 . while this is by no means a definite power number , it serves to illustrate what are reasonable orders of magnitude for @xmath18 .",
    "some other interesting insights can be drawn from this result , for example : system using mrc proves to be quite insensitive to changes in @xmath19 and @xmath3 , indicating that an overwhelmingly dominant impairment is the interuser interference and that playing with adc resolutions will not yield a considerable impact on the energy efficiency ; if zf is used , the dynamics are much more pronounced and show that by going from a system design with a large @xmath19 and large @xmath18 ( `` wasteful '' system ) to a system where @xmath19 and @xmath18 are low ( a more `` economical '' system ) allows for choosing adcs with smaller resolutions .",
    "nevertheless , all systems with a `` reasonable '' @xmath18 ( say 10 - @xmath29 ) should use adcs with resolutions in the range 4 - 10 bits .    in order to focus more on what are the improvements and degradations of energy efficiency",
    "when using different adc resolutions , we turn to a different analysis where spatial load @xmath14 and @xmath9 are swept together with @xmath3 , and additionally @xmath30 , @xmath22 $ ] with @xmath21 and @xmath31 , results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial_loading_m_sweep ] .",
    "what these results show is that going from optimal adc resolution to a very low one can incur a substantial degradation of the energy efficiency ( for zf processing and with assumed values of system parameters , up to 5.5 times ) .",
    "this is due to sumrate being degraded while the overwhelming power consumption of other blocks `` drowns '' the coincident savings in power consumption of the adcs .",
    "another interesting observation is that , in the zf case , increasing the number of antennas can help recover the energy efficiency lost by going to lower bit resolutions .    finally , we take a look at the interplay between the channel estimation length and @xmath3 in the context of energy efficiency .",
    "we analyze a system with @xmath23 $ ] , while varying @xmath3 , @xmath19 and training length .",
    "architecture parameter @xmath18 is again fixed to @xmath32 .",
    "what is plotted is the normalized training length @xmath33 that maximizes the energy efficiency , results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : training_length_sweep ] .",
    "main takeouts from here are that zf is much more sensitive to quantization noise during training ; even in the case of high temporal loading ( indicating fast fading ) , when there is little room to spare for channel estimation , it is beneficial to train the system longer than minimum required time in order to compensate for the effects of quantization . the effect becomes more pronounced as the fading becomes slower and channel estimation is not so costly in terms of time . on the other hand ,",
    "we see that the system using mrc is so overwhelmed by interuser interference that additional training does little to improve the energy efficiency .",
    "a parameterized analysis of energy efficiency in the uplink of a mami system with varying adc bit resolutions at the base station has been performed .",
    "system setup and models have been chosen with the aim of being close to practical system implementations .",
    "initial results ( obtained by simulations ) indicate that using adcs with very low bit resolutions is not an optimal approach from energy effiency point of view , except for highly specific system architectures . instead",
    ", for a wide variety of systems , adcs with intermediate bit resolutions ( 4 - 10 bits ) are shown to maximize system energy efficiency .",
    "additionally , it was also shown that systems using mrc uplink processing are quite insensitive to the changes in adc bit resolution , due to interuser interference being the prime source of impairments in such systems .",
    "on the other hand , systems using zf processing ( in addition to showing overall superiority in terms of energy efficiency compared to mrc - based systems ) are shown to be rather sensitive to changes in bit resolution .",
