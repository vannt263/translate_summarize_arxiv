    "the existence of a very first generation of objects , namely population iii , has been originally postulated by the presence of a noticeable amount of heavy elements in population ii stars ( see , e.g. , carr , bond , & arnett 1984 and references therein ) and has recently gained increasing importance owing to the discovery of intergalactic metals in the ly@xmath10 forest ( cowie et al . 1995 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) . in those respects , population iii objects need to be such massive stars that they can produce metals at the end of their evolution .",
    "recent theoretical analyses on the evolution of metal - free stars predict that the fate of the massive metal - free stars can be classified as follows ( e.g. , heger , woosley , & waters 2000 ; chiosi 2000 ; see also portinari , chiosi , & bressan 1998 for the effects of mass loss . ) : ( 1 ) a star with a mass of @xmath11 collapses completely to a black hole ( bh ) without ejecting any heavy elements ( bond , carr & arnett 1984 ) .",
    "( 2 ) a star of @xmath12 is partly or completely disrupted by electron - positron pair instability .",
    "for @xmath13 , the core completely disrupts , and the whole core involving heavy elements is injected in the intergalactic medium . if it is an extremely energetic event ( a hypernova ) , it might lead to a gamma ray burst ( grb ) .",
    "( 3 ) a star of @xmath14 probably collapses into a black hole .",
    "( 4 ) a star of @xmath15 results in a type ii supernova .",
    "population iii stars are related to various issues that are currently the object of considerable attention .",
    "the luminous population iii stars could cause the reionization of the universe at redshifts @xmath16 ( couchman & rees 1986 ; fukugita & kawasaki 1994 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; miralda - escud & rees 1998 ; gnedin 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , moderately massive bhs as the end products of massive stars might coagulate into a super - massive bh , evolving to primordial agns ( larson 2000 ) .",
    "the accreting super - massive bhs may be more responsible for cosmic reionization ( tegmark & silk 1994 ; sasaki & umemura 1996 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; valageas & silk 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , population iii stars may play an important role in the early evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , tegmark , silk , & blanchard 1994 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ) or the early formation of massive bhs of @xmath17 ( umemura , loeb , & turner 1993 ) .",
    "they may be responsible for the observed abundance patterns of extremely metal - deficient stars ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ; audouze & silk 1995 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) . finally ,",
    "if a significant number of machos are ancient white dwarfs ( mndez & minniti 2000 ) , they may stem from low - mass population iii stars ( carr 1994 ; larson 1998 ; rees 1999 ) . in the light of all of such possible significant consequences , the initial mass function ( imf ) of population iii stars is an issue of undoubted importance .",
    "many authors have studied the collapse of primordial clouds to estimate the masses of population iii stars ( e.g. , matsuda , sato , & takeda 1969 ; yoneyama 1972 ; hutchins 1976 ; silk 1977 , 1983 ; carlberg 1981 ; palla , salpeter , & stahler 1983 ; yoshii & saio 1986 ; nishi et al .",
    "these studies have emphasized the importance of radiative cooling by h@xmath3 molecules because the primordial gas is deficient in heavy elements , which are the most efficient coolants in present - day star formation . in the first collapsed objects",
    ", baryonic gas is heated to temperatures above @xmath18 k during the contraction .",
    "this enhances the h@xmath3 formation rate and causes the h@xmath3 abundance to rise from its initial value of @xmath19 to a quasi - equilibrium value of @xmath20 ( e.g. , palla et al .",
    "1983 ; lepp & shull 1984 ; haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "thus , h@xmath3 molecules cool the gas to a temperature of @xmath21 k. as a result , the jeans mass descends to a stellar mass and population iii stars can form in this way through fragmentation of the first collapsed objects .",
    "although many elaborate analyses have been made , the estimated masses of population iii stars have not been well converged .",
    "several authors have suggested that population iii stars were low mass , whereas others have suggested that they were massive or very massive .",
    "this discrepancy seems to come from most studies being restricted to highly simplified models such as homogeneous , pressureless , and/or spherical collapses .    in the bottom - up scenarios like cold dark",
    "matter ( cdm ) models , the first collapsed pregalactic objects should form at redshifts of @xmath22 and have masses of @xmath23 ( tegmark et al .",
    "because of the asymptotic scale - invariance of the cdm density fluctuations , pregalactic clouds with this mass range could undergo a run - away collapse , forming cores of @xmath24 ( abel et al . 1998 ; abel , norman , & bryan 2000 ) , or form mini - pancakes , fragmenting into pieces of @xmath25 ( bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 ) . in these calculations ,",
    "one of the common features is the formation of a filamentary structure .",
    "filamentary clouds are gravitationally unstable and likely to fragment into dense clumps .",
    "such dense clumps are expected to evolve into population iii stars .",
    "the physics of the fragmentation of filamentary primordial clouds has been studied analytically ( uehara et al .",
    "1996 ) or by a one - dimensional numerical simulation ( nakamura & umemura 1999 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "these studies suggest that the minimum mass of population iii stars is of the order of @xmath5",
    ". however , the physical processes are still unclear to determine whether population iii stars can be far above @xmath5 or be eventually reduced to a few @xmath5 .",
    "thus , as a further step following paper i , we here perform two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "attention is focused on elucidating the physical process of the fragmentation of primordial gas filaments to assess the mass of population iii stars .    in paper",
    "i , we pursued the radial contraction of primordial filaments and showed that the filaments continue to contract quasi - statically , the temperatures staying nearly constant at @xmath26 k. when the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath3 lines , the radial contraction essentially stops . applying a linear stability analysis ,",
    "the fragmentation was expected to take place at that stage and the minimum masses of population iii stars were estimated as a few @xmath5 .",
    "thus , population iii stars were anticipated to be low - mass deficient compared to the present - day stars . in this paper",
    ", we pursue the fragmentation processes of the filaments by means of two - dimensional axisymmetric simulations .",
    "the present model is an improved version of paper i. the numerical model and method are described in  2 .",
    "numerical results are given in  3 and  4 .",
    "we show that filaments with low initial density can fragment into dense clumps before the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath3 lines .",
    "then , the masses of the clumps could be much more massive than a few @xmath5 .",
    "however , relatively dense filaments result in clumps of a few @xmath5 .",
    "hence , in  5 , it is predicted that the initial mass function of population iii stars is likely to be bimodal . in  6 ,",
    "we discuss some implications for the first metal enrichment and baryonic dark matter .",
    "to pursue the collapse and fragmentation of filamentary primordial clouds , we employ a two - dimensional hydrodynamical scheme .",
    "we assume that the system is axisymmetric and that the medium consists of ideal gas . the adiabatic index , @xmath27 , is taken to be 5/3 for monatomic gas and 7/5 for diatomic gas .",
    "we deal with the following 9 species : e , h , h@xmath28 , h@xmath29 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath30 , he , he@xmath28 , and he@xmath31 .",
    "the mass fraction of he is taken to be 0.24 of the total mass .",
    "the basic equations are then described as @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    + \\rho \\mbox{\\boldmath$v$ } \\cdot \\nabla \\psi + \\lambda _ { \\rm net}=0 \\ , ,    \\label{eq : basic3}\\ ] ] @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass density , @xmath40 is the number density , @xmath41 is the velocity , @xmath42 is the gas pressure , @xmath43 is the gravitational potential , @xmath44 is the energy per unit volume , @xmath45 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the symbol @xmath47 denotes the net energy - loss rate per unit volume .",
    "the values with subscript @xmath48 denote those of the @xmath48-th species .",
    "the number density of the @xmath48-th species , @xmath49 , is obtained by solving the following time - dependent rate equations , @xmath50 where the reaction rate coefficients , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are given in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the relative abundances of hydrogen species are given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "we take into account the following thermal processes by h atoms and h@xmath3 molecules : ( 1 ) h cooling by recombination , collisional ionization , and collisional excitation ( cen 1992 ) , ( 2 ) h@xmath3 line cooling by rotational and vibrational transitions ( see below ) , ( 3 ) cooling by h@xmath3 collisional dissociation ( shapiro & kang 1987 ) , and ( 4 ) heating by h@xmath3 formation ( susa , uehara , & nishi 1996 ) . in paper",
    "i , for the h@xmath3 formation heating , we only took into account the contributions by two - body reactions ( shapiro & kang 1987 ) . in this paper , we include the contributions by three - body reactions , which play an important role in temperature evolution after the density reaches @xmath55 @xmath1 ( see  3 ) .",
    "other thermal processes are negligible because the gas temperatures did not exceed 10@xmath56 k in the models calculated in this paper .",
    "as shown by many authors , h@xmath3 line cooling is most efficient in primordial gas .",
    "therefore , careful evaluation of the h@xmath3 line cooling rate is necessary .",
    "we thus compute the h@xmath3 line cooling rate as follows .",
    "first , the level populations at the rotational and vibrational excitations are determined by using a recursion formula ( hutchins 1976 ; palla et al .",
    "for the collisional deexcitation rates , we consider both h - h@xmath3 and h@xmath3-h@xmath3 collisions using the analytical fits of hollenbach & mckee ( 1979 ) and galli & palla ( 1998 ) .",
    "the 21 rotational and 3 vibrational levels are taken into account .",
    "next , a photon escape probability method is applied for each transition ( castor 1970 ; goldreich & kwan 1974 ) .",
    "finally , the line cooling rate is computed as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the h@xmath3 level population at level @xmath48 , @xmath59 is the einstein a - coefficient , and @xmath60 is the energy difference between levels @xmath48 and @xmath61 .",
    "the photon escape probability @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the optical depth at the transition @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the radius of the cloud surface , @xmath68 is the absorption coefficient of the transition @xmath66 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the einstein b - coefficients , and @xmath71 is the thermal doppler width of the transition line @xmath66 .",
    "our cooling function almost coincides with that of galli & palla ( 1998 ) as long as the cloud is optically thin to the h@xmath3 lines .",
    "however , once the cloud becomes opaque to the cooling radiation , our cooling rate significantly deviates from that of galli & palla ( 1998 ) .      in bottom - up scenarios such as cdm models ,",
    "the first collapsed objects at @xmath72 are expected to have masses of @xmath73 . in these clouds ,",
    "the gas is heated above @xmath74 k by shock .",
    "therefore , just after the shock formation , the cooling timescale is likely to be shorter than the free - fall one .",
    "then , the gas is cooled by the h@xmath3 cooling down to the temperature at which the cooling timescale is comparable to the free - fall one ( e.g. , haiman et al . 1996 ; yoneyama 1972 ) .",
    "the resultant gas temperature is estimated to be @xmath75 k , depending weakly on the gas density and the h@xmath3 fraction .",
    "recent numerical simulations have shown that such clouds tend to fragment into filaments that collapse toward the major axes ( e.g. , bromm et al .",
    "1999 ; tsuribe 2000 ) .",
    "the collapsing filaments are expected to fragment into denser clumps where population iii stars will form .",
    "a model of such a filamentary cloud is described below .",
    "the model of a filamentary cloud is basically the same as that presented in paper i. we consider an infinitely long cylindrical gas cloud that is collapsing in the radial direction .",
    "the initial temperature and relative abundances are assumed to be spatially constant . at the initial state ,",
    "the relative abundances of h@xmath29 , h@xmath30 , he@xmath28 , and he@xmath31 are set to zero for simplicity .",
    "we do not consider the effect of dark matter because after virialization of the parent system , the local density of baryonic gas is likely to become higher than the background dark matter density owing to radiative cooling ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1992a , 1992b ; umemura 1993 ) .",
    "the density is assumed to be uniform along the cylinder axis and its radial distribution is expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the effective radius , @xmath78 is the central mass density , @xmath79 is the initial gas temperature , @xmath80 is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath81 is the ratio of the gravitational force to the pressure force . when @xmath82 , the density distribution coincides with that of an isothermal filament in equilibrium ( stodkiewicz 1963 ) . in this paper , we restrict the parameter @xmath81 to @xmath83 since we are interested in the evolution of collapsing clouds .",
    "the radial infall velocity is given by @xmath84 which has a qualitatively similar distribution to that of a self - similar solution of a collapsing filament ( see figure 6 of paper i ) . here , @xmath85 is constant and is set to an initial sound speed ( @xmath86 ) for all the models calculated in this paper .",
    "we also calculated the evolution of the models with different velocity distributions , e.g. , @xmath87 and confirmed that the numerical results are not sensitive to the assumed velocity profiles as long as @xmath88 .",
    "this is because even if the initial cloud is static , the radial contraction is immediately accelerated owing to the h@xmath3 cooling .    for the above model ,",
    "the mass per unit length ( line mass ) is given by @xmath89 note that the line mass of the equilibrium ( @xmath82 ) filament depends only on the temperature .",
    "when the filamentary cloud forms through the gravitational fragmentation of a parent sheetlike cloud , its line mass is expected to be nearly twice that of the equilibrium cloud ( see  2.2 of paper i ) .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath90 for typical models .",
    "this model is then specified by the five parameters : @xmath91 , @xmath79 , @xmath81 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the abundances of @xmath92 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are determined by the conservation of mass and charge .",
    "the initial density of the filament depends sensitively on the properties of the parent cloud such as the mass , collapse redshift , and spin parameter ( see the appendix ) .",
    "thus , we take a wide range of the initial density , @xmath96 @xmath1 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath1 .",
    "previous numerical simulations ( e.g. , haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 ; abel et al .",
    "1998 ; bromm et al .",
    "1999 ) have shown that the temperatures and h@xmath3 relative abundances reach @xmath99 k and @xmath100 , respectively , when the first collapsed objects with masses of @xmath101 are virialized .",
    "thus , the initial temperatures and h@xmath3 abundances are set to @xmath102 k and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the electron abundance is set to @xmath103 for all models .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , the numerical results do not depend sensitively upon @xmath92 as far as @xmath104 , because free electrons can quickly recombine to a level of @xmath105 in the course of the collapse .      the initial model of the computation",
    "is constructed by imposing linear density fluctuations on the model filament described in the above subsection .",
    "the power spectrum of the density fluctuations is assumed to be a power law distribution of @xmath106 on a wavenumber space , where @xmath46 is the wavenumber of the density fluctuation in the @xmath107-direction and @xmath108 is the power index .",
    "the phase of the fluctuations has a random distribution in the range of 0 to @xmath109 . in this paper , the power index @xmath108 is taken to be @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and 0 .",
    "( note that @xmath112 provides scale - invariant fluctuations in the present geometry . )",
    "the amplitude is specified by @xmath113^{1/2}$ ] at @xmath114 .",
    "the simulations were done in the range of @xmath115 .",
    "table [ tab : model ] summarizes the initial parameters of the numerical models calculated in this paper .      the hydrodynamic equations ( [ eq : basic1 ] ) through ( [ eq : basic7 ] ) are solved numerically using a second - order upwind scheme based on the method by nobuta & hanawa ( 1999 ) .",
    "see nobuta & hanawa ( 1999 ) for more details and the test of the code .",
    "the rate equations ( [ eq : basic8 ] ) are solved numerically with the lsodar ( livemore solver for ordinary differential equations with automatic method switching for stiff and non - stiff problems ) coded by l. petzold and a. hindmarsh .",
    "the computations are performed on a cylindrical domain ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) with a fixed boundary condition at @xmath118 and periodic boundary conditions at @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath120 are the maximum @xmath122- and @xmath107-coordinates on the computational domain , respectively .",
    "uniform grids are employed for all runs . in all the models we take @xmath121 to be more than three times the effective radius @xmath123 .",
    "the effect of the fixed boundary is very small .",
    "this is because the density is much lower near the outer boundary ( @xmath124 ) than at the center , i.e. , @xmath125 for all runs .",
    "in fact , we have calculated the cases with larger @xmath121 and have confirmed that the numerical results are not affected .",
    "before examining the fragmentation processes of filamentary clouds , we pursue the evolution of the filamentary clouds with no density fluctuations , i.e. , their radial contraction .",
    "these calculations are the extension of paper i. ( in paper i , we explored the evolution of the filaments in the initial density range of @xmath126 @xmath1 @xmath127 @xmath1 . in this paper , we extend the initial density range to @xmath96 @xmath1 @xmath128 @xmath1 . ) in the following we focus on the evolution of physical quantities on the @xmath107-axis .",
    "see paper i for more details , e.g. , the radial distributions of the physical quantities .",
    "as shown below , the evolution of the filaments can be classified into two types , depending mainly on the initial density .      as a typical example of low - density filaments",
    ", we show the evolution of model a1a which has the initial parameters of @xmath129 @xmath1 , @xmath130 k , and @xmath131 .",
    "the electron and h@xmath3 number fractions are initially set to @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "figure 1a shows the evolution of the temperature and the h@xmath3 number fraction as a function of the central density .",
    "the central density monotonously increases with time .",
    "therefore , the abscissa corresponds to the evolution time . for comparison",
    ", we pursued the evolution of model a1a in which the three - body reactions are not taken into account .",
    "the evolutional paths are shown by dotted lines in figure 1 .",
    "figure 1b shows the evolution of three characteristic timescales as a function of the central density .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dashed - dotted lines denote the contraction time , the cooling time , and the fragmentation time , respectively .",
    "the dotted lines denote the evolution of the temperature and contraction time for the model without the three - body reactions .",
    "the contraction and cooling times are defined as @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "the fragmentation time is defined to be the inverse of the growth rate of the fastest - growing linear perturbation , @xmath136 ( eq . [ 38 ] of nakamura , hanawa , & nakano 1993 ) .",
    "it should be noted that a filament does not undergo fragmentation in one - dimensional calculations , therefore @xmath137 should be regarded as a measure of the free - fall time .    during the contraction",
    ", the temperature stays nearly constant at @xmath138 k because of the h@xmath3 line cooling .",
    "the h@xmath3 number fraction also stays nearly constant at @xmath139 until the density reaches @xmath140 @xmath1 .",
    "after that , the three - body reactions for the h@xmath3 formation become dominant .",
    "accordingly , the h@xmath3 number fraction steeply rises around @xmath141 @xmath1 and almost all the hydrogen atoms become into h@xmath3 molecules by the stage at which the density reaches @xmath142 @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , for the model without the three - body reactions , the h@xmath3 number fraction stays nearly constant at @xmath139 and the contraction stops at the stage at which the density reaches @xmath143 @xmath1 .",
    "the heating rate by h@xmath3 formation also becomes appreciable when the three - body reactions become dominant .",
    "therefore , the temperature rises slowly after the density reaches @xmath144 @xmath1 .",
    "note that the h@xmath3 line cooling rate is always the most efficient during the contraction .    during the contraction , the contraction time nearly coincides with the cooling time until the central density reaches @xmath145 @xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that the cloud collapses in a cooling time .",
    "after the central density reaches @xmath146 @xmath1 , the contraction proceeds quasi - statically because the contraction time becomes longer than the fragmentation time . in other words , if there are fluctuations , the cloud is expected to become unstable to fragmentation after the density reaches @xmath146 @xmath1 .",
    "such evolution is explained as follows .",
    "a density of @xmath146 @xmath1 is almost comparable to a critical density of h@xmath3 , @xmath147 @xmath1 , beyond which lte populations are achieved for the rotational levels of hydrogen molecules .",
    "if the density is less than @xmath148 , then the h@xmath3 line cooling rate is nearly proportional to the square of the density , @xmath149 , and the cooling time is thus inversely proportional to the density , @xmath150 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the density is greater than @xmath148 , then the h@xmath3 line cooling rate is nearly proportional to the density , @xmath151 and accordingly the cooling time is independent of the density .",
    "therefore , after the density reaches @xmath148 , the cooling time becomes longer than the fragmentation time ( @xmath152 ) when the temperature is nearly constant .",
    "( in fact , the cooling time is almost constant during @xmath146 @xmath153 @xmath1 . )",
    "after the central density reaches @xmath154 @xmath1 , the h@xmath3 abundance steeply increases due to the three - body reactions and the radial contraction thus accelerates again owing to the enhanced h@xmath3 line cooling .",
    "( in contrast , for the model without three - body reactions , the radial contraction stops when the central density reaches @xmath155 @xmath1 because of less effective h@xmath3 cooling . ) when the central density reaches @xmath156 @xmath1 , the cloud becomes optically thick to almost all the h@xmath3 lines which significantly contribute to the total cooling rate .",
    "consequently , the contraction essentially stops at that stage .",
    "such evolution is also related to the dynamical stability of self - gravitating clouds .",
    "assuming the polytropic relation of the equation of state ( @xmath157 ) , a hydrostatic cylindrical cloud is stable to radial contraction when @xmath158 . in the present model ,",
    "the temperature is nearly constant during the contraction . in other words ,",
    "the cloud is in a marginally stable state .",
    "thus , once the h@xmath3 line cooling becomes less effective , the radial contraction easily stops .",
    "this is essentially different from that of a spherical cloud .",
    "a spherical polytropic gas cloud can continue to collapse as long as @xmath159 even if the cooling rate becomes less effective ( see  4.1 and omukai & nishi 1998 ) .      as a typical example of dense filaments",
    ", we show the evolution of model c6a which has the initial parameters of @xmath160 @xmath1 , @xmath130 k , and @xmath161 .",
    "the electron and h@xmath3 number fractions are initially set to @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "figures 2a and 2b are the same as those of figures 1a and 1b , respectively , but for model c6a .",
    "the evolution is qualitatively similar to that of model a1a , although the temperatures are about two times higher during the contraction .",
    "since the h@xmath3 formation rates by the three - body reactions are inversely proportional to the temperature , the three - body reactions become more effective at the later stages than for model a1a ( @xmath162 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the contraction time does not become longer than the fragmentation time until the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath3 lines ( @xmath163 @xmath1 ) .",
    "in other words , the contraction proceeds dynamically .",
    "this is due to the effective cooling by the three - body reactions .",
    "therefore , the fragmentation is not expected to take place until the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath3 lines ( @xmath164 @xmath1 ) .",
    "note that , in the model without the three - body reactions , the contraction time becomes longer than the fragmentation time after the central density reaches @xmath165 @xmath1 , and the contraction stops when the central density reaches @xmath166 @xmath1 , i.e. , before the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath3 lines .",
    "we pursued the evolution for the other model parameters tabulated in table [ tab : model ] .",
    "we found that the evolution of all the models falls into either of the two types described above , depending mainly on the initial density .",
    "when the initial density is lower than @xmath167 @xmath1 , the contraction time becomes longer than the fragmentation time before the three - body reactions become effective ( @xmath168 @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the contraction time does not exceed the fragmentation time until the density becomes greater than @xmath148 , beyond which lte populations are achieved for the rotational levels of h@xmath3 molecules . on the other hand ,",
    "when the initial density is greater than @xmath169 @xmath1 and @xmath170 , the contraction proceeds dynamically until the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath3 lines ( @xmath171 @xmath1 ) .",
    "for all the models , the radial contraction essentially stops at the stage at which the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath3 lines which significantly contribute to the total cooling rate .    from the numerical results of the one - dimensional simulations , the filament is likely to fragment into pieces during the stages at which the central density is greater than @xmath172 @xmath1 ( @xmath173 ) and is less than @xmath174 @xmath1 because the radial contraction is appreciably decelerated .",
    "when the filament has an initial density lower than @xmath175 @xmath1 , the fragmentation is expected to take place by the stages at which the three - body reactions become effective . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> the collapse and fragmentation of filamentary primordial gas clouds are explored using one - dimensional and two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with the nonequilibrium processes of hydrogen molecule formation . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud evolution is computed from the initial central density @xmath0 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations show that depending upon the initial density , there are two occasions for the fragmentation of primordial filaments . if a filament has relatively low initial density such as @xmath2 @xmath1 , the radial contraction is slow due to less effective h@xmath3 cooling and appreciably decelerates at densities higher than a critical density , where lte populations are achieved for the rotational levels of h@xmath3 molecules and the cooling timescale becomes accordingly longer than the free - fall timescale . </S>",
    "<S> this filament tends to fragment into dense clumps before the central density reaches @xmath4 @xmath1 , where h@xmath3 cooling by three - body reactions is effective and the fragment mass is more massive than some tens @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if a filament is initially as dense as @xmath6 @xmath1 , the more effective h@xmath3 cooling with the help of three - body reactions allows the filament to contract up to @xmath7 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> after the density reaches @xmath7 @xmath1 , the filament becomes optically thick to h@xmath3 lines and the radial contraction subsequently almost stops . at this final hydrostatic stage </S>",
    "<S> , the fragment mass is lowered down to @xmath8 because of the high density of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the fragment mass upon the initial density could be translated into the dependence on the local amplitude of random gaussian density fields or the epoch of the collapse of a parent cloud . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is predicted that the initial mass function of population iii stars is likely to be bimodal with peaks of @xmath9 and @xmath8 , where the relative heights could be a function of the collapse epoch . </S>",
    "<S> implications for the metal enrichment by population iii stars at high redshifts and baryonic dark matter are briefly discussed . </S>"
