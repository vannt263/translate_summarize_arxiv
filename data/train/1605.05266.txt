    "the problem of inverting the laplacian is one of the fundamental classical problems in mathematical analysis .",
    "the basic existence question is : when can we recover a function of @xmath13 variables , @xmath14 from its laplacian , @xmath15 ?",
    "the related regularity question is : given that @xmath5 belongs to a certain function space , is it true that @xmath10 also belongs to that same function space ?",
    "there are numerous situations when both the existence and regularity question can be answered affirmatively . for the regularity question , when the function space is @xmath16 for @xmath17 or @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the answer is generally yes . one notable `` borderline '' case which is troublesome for the regularity question is when the function space is @xmath20 .    more formally , given @xmath21 with compact support , consider the problem of finding @xmath2 such that @xmath22 classical results give us that any @xmath2 solving this equation must belong to @xmath23 for every @xmath24 ( see for example the book of gilbarg and trudinger @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath25 , the space of functions of bounded mean - oscillation . however , @xmath1 need not belong to @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 may be unbounded near jump discontinuities of @xmath27 , though only logarithmically so .",
    "this problem is very much related to the unboundedness of singular integrals on @xmath28 indeed , using the newtonian potential , we can write @xmath29 one can then deduce properties of @xmath10 from differentiating the integral in the proper way .",
    "it can then be seen that @xmath10 is a matrix of singular integrals applied to @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the standard riesz transforms on @xmath34 @xmath35 where the integral is understood in the sense of the principal value .",
    "the problem of getting @xmath20 bounds on @xmath10 from @xmath20 bounds on @xmath5 then is equivalent to studying the boundedness of the riesz transforms @xmath36 and @xmath37 on @xmath20 .      while it would seem that one should just avoid @xmath20 when inverting the laplacian , many problems in the study of non - linear partial differential equations force us to work with @xmath20",
    "this tension has begotten many interesting so - called borderline inequalities where authors try to quantify losses incurred by working with @xmath28 a good example of this are the stream of brezis - gallouet - wainger , moser - trudinger , and bourgain - brezis inequalities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "though many of those inequalities deal with the lack of critical sobolev embeddings into @xmath20 , some of them also deal with the problem of deriving estimates on @xmath10 from estimates on @xmath5 .",
    "for example , brezis and gallouet proved that given that @xmath38 and @xmath39 on @xmath40 for @xmath41 a smooth and bounded domain ,    @xmath42 for some universal constant @xmath43    the use of this inequality is to be able to assert that while @xmath10 can not be bounded point - wise by the maximum of @xmath44 alone , one could do this with a logarithmic loss .",
    "such inequalities play a crucial role in global well - posedness proofs in various contexts in the study of evolution equations .      in certain situations ,",
    "@xmath10 may belong to @xmath20 even if @xmath45 has jump discontinuities .",
    "this , however , depends upon the geometry of the jump discontinuities of @xmath46 for example , if @xmath45 is the characteristic function of a set with smooth boundary , it can be shown that @xmath47 one does this by observing that if @xmath45 is characteristic function of a set @xmath12 with smooth boundary , then @xmath2 is smooth in the direction tangential to the boundary .",
    "looking at the case when @xmath48 , the upper half plane , is quite revealing .",
    "in fact , an improvement on the brezis - gallouet inequality can actually be proven in this context @xcite . in the besov space @xmath49 which controls any number of riesz transforms of @xmath10 in @xmath20 , whereas anisotropic regularity only allows one to control riesz transforms of the form @xmath50 with @xmath51 . ]",
    "this can be done by direct analysis of the green s function for the laplacian as is done in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this can not be done , however , when @xmath5 is the characteristic function of a set which has a corner because there are numerous examples where @xmath5 is the characteristic function of a set which is smooth away from a single corner and for which @xmath10 is unbounded near the corner .      up to now ,",
    "we have seen two ways to propagate @xmath20 bounds on @xmath10 from bounds on @xmath5 .",
    "both cases require that @xmath5 enjoy some extra regularity ( be it isotropic or anisotropic ) .",
    "there still remains the question : is there a way to control @xmath52 _ just _ by @xmath53 in this short note , we give one case where this can , effectively , be done .",
    "in fact , we prove that if @xmath5 is invariant under rotation by @xmath3 for some @xmath4 , then , @xmath54 as @xmath55 _ without _ any further regularity assumptions on @xmath2 .",
    "is invariant under rotation by @xmath3 only in a neighborhood of @xmath56 . ]",
    "the following two examples of piece - wise constant functions @xmath27 illustrate the importance of the symmetry assumption :     with @xmath27 the piecewise constant function on the right , then @xmath57 .",
    "however , if @xmath58 with @xmath27 the piecewise constant function on the left , then @xmath59 near @xmath60.,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]   with @xmath27 the piecewise constant function on the right , then @xmath57 . however , if @xmath58 with @xmath27 the piecewise constant function on the left , then @xmath59 near @xmath60.,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]    these two examples illustrate the following simple fact : corner - like discontinuities in @xmath5 may lead to @xmath10 being unbounded , but only in certain geometric configurations . in other situations , where more symmetries are present near the corner , @xmath1 will remain bounded .",
    "we now discuss one particular example of a non - linear evolution equation where information about inverting the laplacian on @xmath20 is very important .",
    "recall the 2d incompressible euler equations in a smooth bounded domain @xmath41 : @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath2 is the unique solution of : @xmath63 @xmath64 it is clear that smooth enough solutions of - satisfy : @xmath65 for all @xmath66 and all @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , smooth solutions satisfy an _ a - priori _ @xmath20 estimate .",
    "the yudovich theory ( @xcite ) allows us to construct unique global solutions to - for given @xmath68 .",
    "this is due to the fact that an @xmath20 estimate on @xmath69 automatically implies a quasi - lipschitz estimate on @xmath70 which , in turn , allows us to control the lagrangian flow - map associated to @xmath71 this is all discussed in detail in @xcite so we do not repeat it here .",
    "the @xmath20 estimate on @xmath69 also allows us to construct a unique global smooth solution to - from smooth initial data .",
    "however , due to the fact that the @xmath20 estimate on @xmath69 only implies a quasi - lipschitz bound on @xmath70 ( or using the borderline inequality of subsection 1.1 ) , one can prove that smooth solutions of - satisfy a double exponential type bound :    @xmath72 for some universal constant @xmath43    the reason that this double exponential growth might be possible is precisely because a bound on @xmath69 in @xmath20 does not imply a @xmath73 bound on @xmath74 . hence having a good understanding on when @xmath20 bounds on @xmath69",
    "imply a @xmath73 bound on @xmath74 is very important to understand the mechanisms which lead to double exponential growth of @xmath75 .",
    "improving on this double - exponential estimate in general seems to be a great challenge .",
    "in fact , when the 2d euler equations are studied on smooth bounded domains which are symmetric with respect to some line in @xmath76 , the double exponential bound is known to be optimal in full generality @xcite,@xcite , though the growth is only known to be possible on the boundary .",
    "in fact , the constructions in @xcite and @xcite rely on proving that for certain initial data ( satisfying a suitable symmetry condition ) @xmath77 , @xmath78 which is precluded under our symmetry condition .",
    "it is possible that the idea of this paper could be used to preclude double - exponential growth of @xmath79 away from the boundary .",
    "this seems somewhat related to the work of itoh , miura , and yoneda @xcite .      in the second section of this note",
    ", we discuss some important examples which will help to build intuition about the sorts of issues one faces when inverting the laplacian on @xmath28 in the third section we state and prove the main lemma . in the fourth section",
    "we discuss various direct extensions . in sections 5 and 6",
    "we study the problem of solving @xmath80 when @xmath12 is a bounded lipschitz domain .",
    "in this section we discuss several types of examples which illustrate the difficulty of inverting the laplacian on @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath81 be a harmonic polynomial on @xmath76 which is homogeneous of degree 2 .",
    "in fact , there are only two possibilities for @xmath81 ( up to scaling ) : @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "note that neither of these are invariant under rotation by @xmath84 ( they are , in fact , `` odd '' ) .",
    "let @xmath85 be a smooth function which is identically 1 in @xmath86 and identically @xmath56 outside of @xmath87 .",
    "now define @xmath88 observe that @xmath89 is smooth away from @xmath90 and that on @xmath86 , @xmath91 since @xmath81 is homogenous of degree 2 , @xmath92 . on the other hand , clearly @xmath93 and @xmath94 near @xmath60 .",

    "we note here that this example can be found in the paper of bahouri and chemin @xcite .",
    "we also mention here a short estimate in one dimension which illustrates the use of symmetry conditions .",

    "of course this corollary is implied by the fefferman - stein decomposition ; however , the proof of this corollary via the preceeding lemmas is much more elementary and proceeds simply by decomposing @xmath127 into its odd and even parts and then noticing that the hilbert transform is an isometry and maps odd functions to even functions .",
    "the first lemma is by definition of the bmo norm and using that @xmath128 is odd .",
    "the second lemma can be seen as follows : note that @xmath129 for all @xmath130 since @xmath127 is odd and using the definition of bmo .",
    "let @xmath131 .",
    "we have that @xmath132 so @xmath133 but @xmath134 for all @xmath135 which implies that @xmath136 in particular , @xmath137",
    "in this section we give the statement of the main lemma and its proof .",
    "let @xmath138 .",
    "assume that for all @xmath139 , @xmath140    let @xmath141 solve @xmath142    then , @xmath6    assume that @xmath143 .",

    "let @xmath2 be the unique solution of @xmath146 @xmath147 then , @xmath148 for some universal constant @xmath149 .",
    "we have proven the lemma here in full detail for the case when @xmath150 enjoys four - fold symmetry .",
    "the general case of @xmath151 fold symmetry for @xmath152 is handled in section 4 .",
    "note that it need not be assumed that @xmath150 satisfies the symmetry condition in all of @xmath76 , just in a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "this says that if @xmath150 is symmetric in a neighborhood of any of its jump discontinuities , the corresponding @xmath2 will satisfy the bounds in the lemma .",
    "the proof we give is based on the green s function for the laplacian .",
    "it is possible that other proofs could be given that might give some insight into how this result could be extended to more general linear elliptic equations .",
    "extending this result to , say , divergence - form elliptic equations with bounded measurable coefficients ( under some symmetry assumption ) might be possible .",
    "this result can be seen as dual to the `` key lemma '' of kiselev and sverak in @xcite .",
    "standard considerations about harmonic functions allow us to assume that @xmath150 actually has compact support . using the green s function for the dirichlet problem on @xmath76",
    "we see : @xmath153 by using the symmetries of @xmath150 , we get : @xmath154 now we simplify the kernel : @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 now , @xmath159 @xmath160 moreover , @xmath161 @xmath162 so combining the above terms we get the following kernel : @xmath163    let s focus on the lowest order terms in @xmath164 .",
    "we see that the first order terms are : @xmath165 the third order terms are : @xmath166 @xmath167 the fifth order terms are : @xmath168 the seventh order term is : @xmath169 hence we get that the kernel simplifies to : @xmath170 next , our goal is to show : @xmath171 for some universal constant @xmath172 .",
    "this will imply the lemma .",
    "this can actually be done easily by scaling .",
    "indeed , changing variables in the integral @xmath173 we see that becomes : @xmath174    for fixed @xmath164 , this integral is bounded by a universal constant @xmath172 .",
    "this is because we may split the integral into an integral in the region where @xmath175 , where there are singularities in the denominator , and an integral in the region @xmath176 where there are no singularities in the denominator .",
    "the @xmath176 piece is clearly bounded since the integrand is like @xmath177 for @xmath176 .",
    "the @xmath175 case is bounded because the singularities are far from each other so we may restrict to only one of them at a time , say @xmath178 in this case the numerator is actually 0 hence the singularity becomes like @xmath179 which is integrable in two dimensions with a bound independent of @xmath164 .",
    "the cases when @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 are similar .    to clarify this point further",
    ", we can take the simple case of @xmath183 in this case , the integral in question becomes : @xmath184 which is controlled by a constant multiple of : @xmath185 @xmath186 @xmath187 it is clear that all these quantities are finite as explained above .",
    "in this section we discuss a few extensions of lemma 3.1 .",
    "let @xmath188 .",
    "assume that @xmath150 is @xmath189fold symmetric , for some @xmath190 , @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath191 solve @xmath192 then , @xmath193    note that the lemma is false in the case @xmath194 via the counterexamples in section 2 .    as before , @xmath195",
    "since @xmath150 is @xmath189symmetric , @xmath196    _ claim : _",
    "@xmath197 for some universal constant @xmath172 .",
    "_ proof of the claim : _    let s first see why this fails when @xmath194 .",
    "this is because we get : @xmath198 now we scale in @xmath199 and we see : @xmath200 the problem is that for @xmath201 very large ( up to @xmath202 ) there is a large contribution from the integral which is of size @xmath203 since the integrand is only like @xmath204 which is not integrable in two dimensions for @xmath201 large .",
    "hence , to show the boundedness for higher symmetries we will need to focus on cancellations for the highest order terms in @xmath205 .    for @xmath4 we see :    @xmath206 where we denote by @xmath207 the rotation matrix which rotates vectors in @xmath76 counterclockwise by @xmath3 .",
    "remember that we are only concerned with the highest order terms in @xmath205 ( which are the lowest order terms in @xmath164 ) .",
    "we get that the highest order terms in @xmath205 of @xmath208 are : @xmath209 note that @xmath210 hence , @xmath211 now we use a simple lemma .",
    "for @xmath212 let @xmath207 be the linear transformation on @xmath76 which rotates vectors counterclockwise by @xmath213 then , for any @xmath214 , @xmath215    assuming this lemma is true , we then see that the highest order terms in @xmath205 disappear .",
    "one can then follow the proof of lemma 3.1 to conclude .",
    "we leave the details to the interested reader .",
    "[ proof of lemma 4.3 ]    first , by scaling it suffices to assume that @xmath216 .",
    "furthermore , since rotation matrices on @xmath76 commute , it suffices to assume that @xmath217 .",
    "the lemma then comes down to proving the following three identities : @xmath218 @xmath219 and @xmath220 these are equivalent to the three identities : @xmath221 @xmath222 and @xmath223 respectively . here",
    "is where the difference between @xmath194 and @xmath4 becomes manifest .",
    "these identities can be checked using formulas for geometric sums .",
    "a natural question which could be asked is : _",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath150 are as in lemma 4.1 and @xmath224 is @xmath10 necessarily bounded ? _",
    "while it might seem that this is true , counterexamples can be constructed rather simply . however , if we give a natural constraint on the growth of @xmath225 near @xmath56 , then @xmath10 is necessarily bounded .",
    "let @xmath226 assume that @xmath150 is @xmath227-fold symmetric near @xmath56 for some @xmath4 and @xmath228 let @xmath2 be an @xmath229 solution of : @xmath230 on @xmath231 then , @xmath232    the assumptions of the lemma are sharp in the sense that there are , for each @xmath233 , counterexamples with @xmath234 near 0 .    by rotation invariance it suffices to prove that @xmath235 is bounded independent of @xmath164 . by assumption , the following must hold if @xmath236 @xmath237 in particular , if @xmath238 is much smaller than @xmath199 , we can replace one of the powers of @xmath238 in the singularity by @xmath199 and be essentially in the same scenario as lemma 4.1 . in the case",
    "when @xmath239 the symmetry can be used to gain enough powers of @xmath199 in the numerator to , again , remove the singularity .",
    "we will now construct a counterexample to lemma 4.4 when the growth assumption on @xmath225 near 0 is removed .",
    "there exists @xmath2 which is 4-fold symmetric and smooth away from 0 for which @xmath98 but @xmath240 .",

    "in this section we prove that if we solve @xmath11 with @xmath12 a bounded lipschitz domain whose boundary is @xmath252 away from finitely many corners and which is symmetric around the corners , then @xmath1 is uniformly bounded . before proving this",

    "one way to do this is to say that locally ( near the corner ) @xmath12 just consists of two straight lines which form a corner . taking this definition of a corner",
    "actually makes the result too restrictive since it will boil down to a situation like the one in figure 1 on the right",
    ". we will call a corner formed by the intersection of finitely many lines of different slope a polygonal corner .",
    "we will say that @xmath12 has a corner at a point if @xmath253 consists of @xmath252 curves which intersect at that point with different slopes .",

    "we only give a basic sketch of the proof since the issue of domains with corners will be taken up in much greater detail in a later work .",
    "let @xmath12 be a set which has a corner at @xmath90 and for which @xmath253 is @xmath252 away from @xmath90 .",
    "it is clear ( using @xcite ) that @xmath1 is locally bounded away from @xmath90 so we only need to show that @xmath1 is bounded in a neighborhood of @xmath90 .",
    "the proof will proceed by `` cutting out '' the corners .",
    "since the problem is rotational invariant , we can assume that the line @xmath258 bisects the corner .",
    "call the angle at the corner @xmath259 .",
    "since the boundary of @xmath12 near the corner just consists of @xmath252 curves which intersect at the corner , @xmath12 can be written as a union of two pieces : one which is a polygonal corner in a small neighborhood of @xmath90 and one an error term .",
    "the area of the error region intersected with any small ball of radius @xmath260 centered at @xmath90 is on the order of @xmath261 .",
    "the part of @xmath10 coming from the error term can easily be shown to be bounded .",
    "this then reduces the problem to proving boundedness for the case of a symmetric polygonal corner .",
    "this is a computation which is in the appendix .",
    "more specifically , it suffices to consider the boundedness of the following integral independent of @xmath164 : @xmath262 with @xmath85 some @xmath252 function with @xmath263 , @xmath264 for some constant @xmath265 which relates to the angle @xmath266 .",
    "hence we can break this integral into : @xmath267 the first integral representing the polygonal corner and the second representing the error since @xmath268 the boundedness of the first term is a computation which is similar to the one in section 4 and we leave its details for the appendix . the error term ( which is also done in @xcite )",
    "can be controlled using the ideas in proposition 1 of @xcite , for example .",
