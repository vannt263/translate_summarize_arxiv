    "information theory fundamentally deals with the problem of reproducing at one point , either exactly or approximately , a message selected at another point . the mathematical model for classical information theory",
    "was founded in a seminal paper by claude shannon in the year @xmath2 @xcite . in the last few decades ,",
    "application of quantum theory to information processing tasks has lead to several discoveries @xcite and their synthesis has given birth to the epoch of quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "suitable use of resources from quantum theory can outperform their classical counterparts in several information theoretic , communication , and computational tasks and some of these proposals have already been implemented by the present day quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "the advantage of quantum mechanical systems over classical systems may be ascribed to the fact that the state of a quantum system is given by a unit vector in some complex vector space .",
    "however , some information processing tasks in quantum theory are restricted .",
    "for example , the holevo s theorem @xcite puts a restriction on the amount of classical information that can be extracted from a quantum state ( _ accessible information _ ) .",
    "more recently , a remarkable theorem due frenkel and weiner @xcite shows that the classical information storage in a @xmath0-level quantum system can not be more than the corresponding @xmath0-state classical system . despite of such restrictions ,",
    "a quantum system can give advantage in a suitably designed communication task known as _ random access codes _",
    "these were initially introduced by weisner by the name of conjugate coding @xcite , and was later rediscovered in @xcite by ambainis _",
    "_ as pointed out in @xcite , the possibility of encoding infinite amount of classical information in a single quantum state ( a vector in a complex hilbert space ) and the freedom to perform different non - commutative measurements for extracting the encoded information render quantum random access codes ( qracs ) advantageous .",
    "qracs establish that bennett s first law of quantum information , i.e. ,  @xmath3 qubit @xmath4 bit \" @xcite ( here @xmath5 reads as  @xmath6 can do the job of @xmath7 \" ) is actually strict , i.e. , as a communication resource @xmath3 qubit outperforms @xmath3 bit in rac tasks .",
    "recently , tavakoli _ et al .",
    "_ have studied racs with high - level symbols that use @xmath0-level classical and quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that high - level quantum systems provide significant advantage in the average performances of the rac tasks over their classical counterparts @xcite . in other words , generalized version of bennett s first law ,",
    "that  @xmath3 qudit @xmath4 dit \" is also strict , i.e. , in a @xmath0-level rac quantum system outperforms its classical counterpart .    here , we ask whether a @xmath1-level quantum system can outperform a @xmath0-level classical system in some communication task , where @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "we show that for high - level racs there exist quantum codes that use relatively lower - level quantum systems for encoding to give better average success probability compared to the best classical codes that use high - level classical systems for encoding .",
    "this establishes an advantage of lower level quantum systems as communication resources over a higher level classical system .",
    "it is important to note that the quantum supremacy established by our protocol is stronger than that established in the existing qrac protocols . in other words",
    ", we can say that in certain communication tasks @xmath3 qu-@xmath1-dit @xmath9 @xmath0-dit with @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we briefly review racs in section-[sec2 ] ; in section-[sec3 ] , we discuss the high - level racs ; in section-[sec4 ] , we present our protocol for implementing high - level racs with lower - level quantum systems , and finally give our conclusions in section-[sec5 ] .",
    "random access codes ( racs ) are a class of communication tasks involving two separated parties , ( say ) alice and bob .",
    "alice is given an @xmath10-bit string @xmath11 chosen uniformly at random from the set @xmath12 .",
    "the other party , bob is given a number @xmath13 , chosen uniformly at random .",
    "bob s task is to correctly guess the @xmath14 bit of alice .",
    "alice can help bob in guessing the bit by sending some information about her string .",
    "however , the amount of information that alice can send to bob is restricted to @xmath3-cbit .",
    "we denote such a rac by the symbol @xmath15 $ ] , meaning that @xmath10 bits are encoded into @xmath3 bit and @xmath16 denotes the merit of the success of recovering initial bits which can be either ` average success probability ' ( @xmath17 ) or ` worst case success probability ' ( @xmath18 ) . in the quantum version of rac",
    ", alice can encode her @xmath10-bit string into a two level quantum system , i.e. , a qubit .",
    "one can also define a more general version of rac denoted by @xmath19 $ ] ( with @xmath20 ) , which is defined analogous to the @xmath15 $ ] racs @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we consider racs with @xmath21 .    for the simplest @xmath22 rac ,",
    "the worst case classical success probability is @xmath23 and the corresponding optimal classical average success probability is @xmath24 .",
    "here we use the upper - index @xmath25 to denote the classical case .",
    "if alice sends one of the bit in her string ( either first or second bit ) , bob can guess that bit correctly but he has to guess the other bit randomly .",
    "this naive protocol gives the aforementioned optimal classical success probability ( both worst and average ) , and moreover one can show that no other classical protocol can do better @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the authors in @xcite have shown that for such a classical rac non - trivial quantum protocols exist which is described as the following : alice can encode her string @xmath26 into the state @xmath27 of a two - level quantum system using the following encoding scheme : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are pauli operators and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 @xmath32 being the ` up ' eigenstate of pauli-@xmath33 ( pauli-@xmath6 ) operator . to decode the first bit , bob , after receiving the encoded particle from alice , performs a @xmath34 measurement ( i.e performs measurement in computational basis @xmath35 ) on it and guesses the bit value to be @xmath36 @xmath37 upon obtaining the ` up ' ( ` down ' ) outcome . for the second bit , bob performs @xmath38 measurement and similarily guesses the outcome . for this encoding - decoding scheme ,",
    "the worst case success probability is @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that the average success probability is the same as that of the worst case , thus @xmath40 .",
    "later , chuang ( as mentioned in @xcite ) generalized this protocol to a @xmath41 qrac , while hayashi _",
    "@xcite proved that no quantum @xmath42 rac exists for @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "however , it has been shown that @xmath42 qrac is possible for any @xmath45 with @xmath46 provided that shared randomness is accessible to both parties @xcite .    at this point",
    "we would like to mention that qracs have been originally studied in the context of quantum finite automata @xcite .",
    "they also have applications in quantum communication complexity @xcite , in particular for network coding @xcite and locally decodable codes @xcite .",
    "qracs have also been applied to the quantum state learning problem @xcite . in recent times",
    ", this study also finds applications in semi - device - independent random number expansion @xcite as well as semi - device - independent key distribution @xcite . also , the study of qracs and it s variant , namely _",
    "parity oblivious _",
    "racs has foundational implications @xcite , in particular they have been studied for operational depiction of preparation contextuality of mixed quantum states .",
    "recently tavakoli _ et al . _",
    "have studied high - level racs in ref.@xcite .",
    "alice receives an @xmath10-dit string @xmath47 , uniformly at random , where a @xmath48 i.e @xmath49 takes values from an alphabet set @xmath50 .",
    "she then encodes her string @xmath51 into a classical @xmath0-level system ( or a quantum @xmath0-level system ) , which she can send to bob in any state she wishes .",
    "bob receives a number @xmath13 chosen uniformly at random and his task is to recover the @xmath14 dit , i.e. , @xmath52 of alice s string .",
    "such a task is denoted by @xmath53 $ ] rac . as conjectured in @xcite and later proved in @xcite , the maximum average success probability for classical racs",
    "is achieved by the ` majority - encoding identity - decoding ' protocol .",
    "a closed analytical formula for the classical average success probability in this task is hard to derive for general values of parameters @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , for @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] cases , the analytic expressions can be obtained for the maximum success probabilities , that read @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the authors in @xcite have also constructed non - trivial quantum protocols for @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] cases .",
    "the @xmath54 $ ] quantum protocol is a generalized version of the @xmath58 $ ] protocol already discussed in the previous section .",
    "we describe the protocol here for completeness : consider the computational basis @xmath59 , in the hilbert space @xmath60 and also consider the fourier basis @xmath61 , with @xmath62 being the @xmath63 root of unity , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "consider the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "alice encodes her strings in the following manner : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , with @xmath69 being the normalization constant . for decoding",
    "the first dit @xmath70 bob performs a measurement in the computational basis @xmath71 and guesses the value as @xmath72 when the projector @xmath73 clicks in the measurement .",
    "similarly , for the second dit , he performs a measurement in the fourier basis @xmath74 and guess the dit value according to the measurement outcome .",
    "this protocol gives average success probability @xmath75 which is strictly greater than the corresponding optimal classical success probability @xmath76 for all @xmath0 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the optimal advantage of the qrac over the rac measured by the ratio of the success probabilities is observed for @xmath77 .",
    "we consider the @xmath54 $ ] rac task , but alice has access to a @xmath1-dimensional quantum system to encode her classical message where the dimension @xmath1 of the quantum system is strictly less than @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate whether with a limited dimensional quantum system alice and bob can construct non - trivial quantum codes for the task .",
    "it turns out that the following qrac protocol has this interesting feature .",
    "vs @xmath0 .",
    "the plot ( red dots ) gives the _ dimensional advantage _ @xmath78 of the quantum system used for encoding as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath0 for which a restricted quantum encoding is advantageous over the best classical @xmath0-rac is @xmath77 .",
    "this advantage in general increases with increasing @xmath0 although remains flat in some range of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath79 for @xmath80 and then increases to @xmath81 for @xmath82 , etc.,width=321,height=245 ]    _ alice s encoding _ : alice encodes her string @xmath83 as follows : @xmath84 with @xmath85 being the normalized state considered in eq.([hrac ] ) , and @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the operators as defined in the previous section , and @xmath88 is the identity operator . _",
    "bob s decoding _ : to decode the first dit bob performs measurement in the computational basis @xmath89 and on obtaining outcome @xmath90 he guesses the value as @xmath72 , but when he obtains the outcome @xmath91 he guesses an answer from the set @xmath92 uniformly at random . to guess the value of the second dit , he performs a measurement in the fourier basis @xmath93 and uses the same strategy as before to make a guess .",
    "the average success probability of this quantum protocol turns out to be : @xmath94,\\ ] ] where we call @xmath78 a _ dimensional advantage _ since it gives the extent to which one can lower the dimension of the quantum system used for encoding and still get advantage over the best classical protocol . for any classical",
    "@xmath54 $ ] rac the optimal average success probability is @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , in order to do better , our quantum protocol must satisfy @xmath95 condition-(4 ) implies that our quantum protocol gives advantage for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the greatest integer less then or equal to @xmath99 .",
    "this means that the smallest value of @xmath1 that yields an advantage is restricted . for small values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the allowed value of @xmath1 is exactly @xmath100 , as dictated by condition-(4 ) ( see fig.1 ) . as @xmath0 increases ,",
    "the allowed values of @xmath1 become @xmath100 and @xmath101 and so on .",
    "therefore , one can not arbitrarily choose any lower @xmath1 dimensional quantum system to supersede the optimal classical @xmath0-rac protocol .",
    "in fact , there exists a minimum value of @xmath1 , encoding below which would be bad , since it would yield a success probability lower than that of the optimal classical @xmath0-rac .",
    "fig.1 illustrates how the dimensional advantage @xmath78 grows with @xmath0 .",
    "note that for @xmath102 we get no dimensional advantage ( in fig.1 , @xmath103 corresponds to this case ) .",
    "in conclusion , our protocol demonstrates the supremacy of a lower - dimensional quantum system over it s higher - dimensional classical counterpart , a consequence of the existence of superposition of states and non - commutative measurements in quantum theory .",
    "our result is slightly stronger than the earlier results on racs which prove the advantage of using a quantum system over a classical system of the same dimension @xcite . in general , the study of qracs is important as there exist communication scenarios where the use of quantum resources proves to be of no advantage over their classical counterparts , a result of holevo s theorem @xcite , a general version of which has been proved more recently by frenkel and weiner @xcite . while these theorems address the question of encoding and decoding a random variable ,",
    "racs are concerned with decoding randomly chosen parts of such an encoded random variable .",
    "finally , we would like to state that proving the optimality of high - level racs using a limited dimensional quantum system remains an open problem and needs further investigation .",
