    "such singularities are not present in the spacelike renormalization scale invariant quantities @xmath6 , as a consequence of the basic principles of quantum field theories @xcite such as locality , unitarity and microcausality",
    ". if such quantities are to be evaluated as functions of the running coupling @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 ) , then the coupling @xmath9 should not have such ( landau ) singularities .",
    "thus @xmath2 should be an analytic ( holomorphic ) function of @xmath4 in the entire complex plane , with the exception of the negative semiaxis @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 ) .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath2 is indirectly supported by calculations using functional methods @xcite and lattice calculations @xcite .",

    "numerical evidence is presented for the large-@xmath27 adler function , which is a spacelike renormalization scale invariant quantity whose expansion is known to all orders . finally , i argue that the obtained conclusions are applicable also to the timelike observables , because they can be represented as integral transformations of the aforementioned spacelike quantities . a more detailed consideration of these topics has been presented in ref .",

    "we can see the following : in all three ir finite frameworks , ( a ) the naive power series gives highly divergent behavior ; ( b ) the series in logarithmic derivatives stabilizes to a degree at intermediate orders @xmath167-@xmath168 and then starts to oscillate increasingly when @xmath99 increases further ; which is outside the range presented in figs .",

    "( [ repl ] ) ] surprisingly well as @xmath99 increases , there is no trace of possible divergent behavior at high @xmath99 ( i checked this up to @xmath169 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the ( @xmath0-like ) pqcd , all three methods give consistently divergent behavior with increasing @xmath99 , this being mainly the consequence of the vicinity of the landau singularities when @xmath170 .",
    "one reason for the failure of the power series ( in all cases ) and of the series in logarithmic derivatives ( in pqcd already at low @xmath99 ; in ir finite framework at high @xmath171 ) is the renormalon growth of the coefficients @xmath172 .",
    "the dpa - related method ( [ dbg ] ) , on the other hand , appears to deal with the renormalon growth of the coefficients very well , and the only problem for that method are the landau singularities which , in the frameworks with holomorphic ( analytic ) and ir finite @xmath2 are nonexistent .",
    "even more , this dpa - related method , which is based on the truncated series in logarithmic derivatives , is completely renormalization scale independent , i.e. , in figs .",
    "[ lbvsmu ] it would be represented by exactly horizontal lines .",
    "the timelike observables @xmath173 , such as cross sections and decay widths , can be related with spacelike observables @xmath174 , via integral transformations .",
    "often the integral transformations between @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the same or similar as between the @xmath175 ratio @xmath176 and the adler function @xmath177 @xmath178 where in the last integral the integration contour is in the complex @xmath179-plane encircling the singularities of the integrand ; for example , on the circle of radius @xmath180 in the counterclockwise direction ( and not cutting the negavive semiaxis ) .",
    "the basic idea for evaluations of such timelike quantities in the qcd frameworks with analytic and ir finite @xmath2 is that first the spacelike quantity @xmath181 is evaluated ( with @xmath179 on the mentioned circle ) , with aforementioned method of truncated series in logarithmic derivatives , or the dpa - related method ( [ dbg ] ) ; then the contour integral ( [ fttf ] ) is applied on this quantity .",
    "theoretical approaches such as dyson - schwinger equations and other functional methods , most of the analytic ( holomorphic ) qcd models , as well as lattice calculations , suggest that the qcd running coupling @xmath2 ( @xmath182 ) is finite in the ir limit @xmath12 . here , it was argued that in such frameworks the evaluation of the renormalization scale invariant spacelike qcd quantities @xmath6 , at low @xmath183 , should not be performed as a naive truncated power series , but rather as a truncated series in logarithmic derivatives , cf .",
    "( [ dmantrir])-([tananir ] ) .",
    "the reason for this lies in the fact that the powers do not take into account correctly the nonperturbative ( nonanalytic in @xmath9 ) terms , and this is reflected in the increasingly strong renormalization scale dependence when the number of power terms increases .",
    "the logarithmic derivatives , on the other hand , take into account the nonperturbative terms in a systematic way , and the scale dependence of such truncated series does not increase due to such terms ( which are under control in this case ) but only due to the renormalon growth of the coefficients .",
    "further , in such frameworks , the evaluation method of eq .",
    "( [ dbg ] ) , which is based on the truncated series in logarithmic derivatives and can be regarded as a generalization of the diagonal pad method , gives results which are exactly renormalization scale independent and show very good convergence properties as the number of terms increases .",
    "numerical evidence for all these arguments was presented for the leading-@xmath27 ( lb ) adler function @xmath184 , which is a renormalization scale invariant quantity in all such frameworks .",
    "it is , however , realistic to assume that such qcd frameworks , with finite @xmath2 when @xmath12 , do not give us all the nonperturbative effects in the `` perturbative '' leading - twist term , and that other nonperturbative contributions should be added , either via higher - twist terms of ope @xcite , or by directly including such contributions in the specific considered observables @xcite ( see also : @xcite ) .",
    "if applying ope in qcd with holomorphic and ir finite coupling @xmath2 , it is preferable that @xmath2 differs very little from the underlying ( @xmath0-like ) perturbative coupling @xmath15 at high @xmath16 , in order to maintain the itep school interpretation @xcite of the ope higher - twist terms as being exclusively of the ir origin . in ref",
