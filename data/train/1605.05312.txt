    ", we use the terms  hopping \" and  hybridization \" to describe the transition between the atomic or molecular orbitals and bloch states , respectively .",
    "the individual chain is invariant under mirror reflection with respect to planes perpendicular to the chain @xmath23 .",
    "note that there are two inequivalent types of planes which can not be connected with the lattice vector : ones crossing the sites ( plane 1 ) and ones crossing between the sites ( plane 2 ) ( see fig .  [ fig:1d - chain]b ) .",
    "when @xmath17 , plane 1 for the one chain and plane 2 for the other chain coincide with each other and therefore the total hamiltonian retains the global mirror symmetry @xmath23 ( fig .",

    "the last line forces @xmath28 to be zero .",
    "thus , the inter - chain hybridization between the @xmath16 bloch states are prohibited when @xmath17 .",
    "the key factors in the proof are the following : ( i ) there are two types of mirror planes which can not be connected with the lattice vector , ( ii ) the @xmath16 state is the eigenstate of the mirror reflection , whose eigenvalue depends on the planes , and ( iii ) when @xmath17 , the common mirror planes correspond to plane 1 and plane 2 for the first and second chains , respectively .",

    "we thus introduced a concept of saim @xmath67 for the respective nets and established its relation to interlayer hybridization of the bloch states , which can be summarized as follows .",

    "when an identical layer is stacked side by side , a theorem on interlayer hybridization is derived .",

    "frequently , we find multilayer structures where the neighboring layers are not exactly identical but related with each other by some symmetry operation @xmath110 ; namely , inversion , reflection , etc .. extending the present theory to such cases is in principle possible if the corresponding symmetry operation does not change the shape of the two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "for example , three - dimensional hexagonal boron nitride consists of two kinds of bn layers which are the inverse of the others .",
    "although the atomic configurations are different for the two adjacent layers , their brillouin zones are common .",
    "we here address an extension to such systems to enhance the applicability of the present theory .",

    "the in - plane shift @xmath37 is defined with these nets .",
    "next , we see if @xmath92 is transformed by @xmath110 by either of the following : @xmath112 in the former case , the character of @xmath113 for the first and second layers are the same , whereas in the latter @xmath113 for the second layer is complex conjugate of the first since they are related by @xmath114 , with @xmath115 being the time reversal .",
    "equation ( [ eq : summary - singleband ] ) is obviously applicable if either of the following is satisfied : ( i ) @xmath116 is transformed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition1 ] ) , or ( ii ) @xmath116 is transformed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition2 ] ) _ and _ @xmath113 is a real representation of @xmath29 . otherwise , whether the interlayer hybridization is zero or nonzero depends on the specific character of @xmath113 . in summary ,",
    "the extension is achieved with only two additional steps for the cell - periodic part : ( a ) redefine the in - plane shift between the layers based on the positions of the orbital and ( b ) examine if it is real representation of @xmath29 .",
    "when we apply the present results to realistic models based on the crystal structure of the material , step ( b ) above requires a burdensome calculation to specify the character of @xmath117 . to facilitate efficient applications ,",
    "we here exemplify situations where eq .",

    "when a number of identical or symmetry - related layers are stacked so that the shape of their corresponding two - dimensional brilouin zones are the same , the total hamiltonian remains block - diagonalized with respect to the crystal wavenumber defined for the original layers . by arranging the interlayer shift vectors , desired combinations of hybridizations among the layers",

    "the hybridization amplitudes among @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 can then be nonzero , respectively . in summary ,",
    "the band dispersion in @xmath125 direction tends to be much flatter through @xmath126 than through other @xmath0 points because of the canceled interlayer hybridizations .      in the above discussions",

    "are possible even for @xmath92 , if their orbital characters are different .",

    "this point is elaborated in appendix  [ sec : multi - etc ] .",
    "finally , the following rule is established : in general multilayer systems , the bloch states at @xmath116 for each layer are well protected from interlayer hybridizations only if their energy eigenvalues are nondegenerate and well separated from other states .",
    "we below demonstrate that this seemingly naive rule of thumb indeed applies to a wide range of multilayer systems .",
    "in the previous section , we have presented a theory relating the interlayer hybridization of the bloch states and the in - plane shift between adjacent layers based on a general modeling of layered materials .",
    "the significant consequence is that whether the hybridization is canceled or not can be discussed only by examining the relative geometry of adjacent layers . we next show that our theory indeed applies to real materials .",

    "this characteristic is especially utilizable for van der waals - coupled multilayer materials because they can adopt various stacking patterns thanks to the weak interlayer binding . in particular , when the valence - band top and/or conduction - band bottom are located at any of @xmath201 in the monolayer form , one can demonstrate stacking - dependent characteristics of electronic states with low - energy probes .",
    "it is expected to be often the case because @xmath201 includes some of the high - symmetry special points , where the band extrema are located .",
    "in fact , some of the authors have shown that the dimensionality of the excitons in mos@xmath136 is controlled by the stacking geometry through the reflectivity measurement  @xcite .    for more general three - dimensional crystals , however , it is difficult to observe the low - dimensional bloch states .",
    "such states usually emerge in the middle of the valence / conduction bands because the flat @xmath0-point path usually does not pass through the special points of the _ three - dimensional _ brillouin zone . in order to observe such high energy states , heavy doping or a wavenumber- and energy - resolved electronic probe",
    "is necessary .",
    "still , we believe that our maps of bifp are useful for electronic materials search and design because of their general applicability . with a broad range of candidate materials , it could be possible to find appropriate ones where we can detect the low - dimensional bloch states .",
    "in fact , in lih , the energy of the flat band in the @xmath188@xmath142 path is near the fermi energy , where we could inject holes with chemical or field - effect doping .",
    "a general remark on the development of tight - binding models for layered materials is derived from our theory .",
    "when one theoretically studies a layered system , only a small number of inter - site hopping matrix elements are usually retained in the model , particularly for those between the sites of different layers .",
    "however , when the layers are shifted from each other , such modeling will suffer from underestimation of interlayer transfer of electrons in the states within the saim , unless the hopping terms between  unshifted \" layers are included .",
    "take for example the case of the graphite with the bernal or rhombohedral stackings ( sec .",
    "[ sec : graphite ] ) .",
    "if only the hopping matrix elements up to the nearest - neighbor layers are retained in the modeling , the electrons in the @xmath134-point states never propagate across the whole layers ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : graphite - sum ] ) . to avoid such too idealized situations , the inter - site hopping between the second - nearest neighbor layers ( @xmath202 in the partoens - peeters modeling  @xcite ) is needed for the both stackings .      in this work ,",
    "we have addressed only the interlayer transitions of electrons induced by the intrinsic hamiltonian .",
    "the important fact is that the interlayer transitions concerning electronic states in the saim is subject to the stacking geometry .",
    "this is also extended to more general interlayer transitions via external perturbations such as incident light .",
    "the only difference is that the operator does not always transform according to the identity representation as does the hamiltonian .",
    "reconsideration of optical absorption spectra for few - layer graphene  @xcite from the present viewpoint could give a new insight .",
    "also , an extension to phononic systems is possible considering that the displacement vector of the phonon mode obeys the bloch theorem . by expanding the total born - oppenheimer energy with respect to the mode displacement vectors for the isolated layers",
    ", we can derive the rule for which second derivatives become zero .",
    "our maps for the saim and bifp are useful when one considers such extensions .",
    "we have addressed the bloch - phase interference on the electronic motion in layered crystals and presented a general theory on the interlayer hybridizations in view of the stacking geometry .",
    "the key result is the development of the saim in the two - dimensional bz , displaying which bloch states are prevented from the interlayer hybridization depending on the stacking shift .",
    "we have demonstrated that our theory is useful for studying the electronic states in multilayer systems with applications to bn , graphite , and tmd .",
    "also , we have shown that the prevention of the interlayer hybridization is robust even in general three - dimensional crystals and it induces strongly anisotropic electronic bands where effects of some inter - site hopping amplitudes are canceled .",
    "the theory is based on the classification of the periodic lattice structure and therefore in principle applicable to every material with periodic structure , which gives us a simple view on understanding and controlling the electronic states .",
    "this work was supported by mext element strategy initiative to form core research center in japan and jsps kakenhi grant number 15k20940 ( r. a. ) from japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) .",

    "<S> every electronic one - body wavefunction of the eigenstate in the periodic system is factorized into the cell - periodic function and plane wave . </S>",
    "<S> we address effects of the latter factor on the hybridization between the states , which is in principle dependent only on the lattice structure . </S>",
    "<S> a particular focus is on layered material , where the bloch states for the isolated layers are characterized by the two - dimensional crystal wavenumber @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we establish a concept of stacking - adapted interference manifold ( saim ) for the two - dimensional brillouin zone : when any identical layers are stacked with a parallel shift , the interlayer hybridization is always suppressed for a certain set of @xmath0 vectors determined only by the stacking geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the usefulness of this concept with first - principles calculations for boron nitride , transition - metal dichalcogenide and graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply the interference manifold to general three - dimensional crystals to derive special k - point paths , along which the bloch - phase interference strongly suppresses the band dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a complete set of the maps of such @xmath0 for all the nets and bravais lattices , building a basis for understanding the electronic dynamics in periodic structures . </S>"
