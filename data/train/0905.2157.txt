    "it had been known for a long time @xcite that other `` exotic '' spin orderings with a vanishing expectation value of the spin density are theoretically possible , but only recently such orders have been observed in numerical studies of realistic models @xcite .",
    "one prominent example of unconventional order parameter is the spin current ( the so - called vector chirality @xcite , or @xmath5-type nematic @xcite order parameter ) . in a spin chain",
    ", the vector chirality operator @xmath6 can be defined as a vector product of two adjacent spins : @xmath7 where @xmath8 labels the lattice sites along the chain .",
    "obviously , the vector chiral order is nonzero in a state which has a classical helical magnetic order , and the projection of @xmath9 onto the helix axis distinguishes between the left and right spirals . for low - dimensional magnets , such unconventional order parameters may become dominating , since quantum fluctuations have a tendency to destroy the usual magnetic order .",
    "a state with vector chiral order may be viewed as the result of phase fluctuations destroying the helical order , but still keeping the preferred sense of rotation contained in a classical spiral @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath9 as the spin current can be understood from the equation of motion , which for a hamiltonian of the form @xmath10 reads @xmath11 .",
    "one can show that in the ground state the net spin current should be zero , which for the above hamiltonian translates into the condition @xmath12 .",
    "spin current states have been relatively well studied for anisotropic frustrated chains @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that a strong external magnetic field can be used as a control parameter to drive the spin current in isotropic frustrated spin chains .",
    "the interest to this topic is further boosted by the fact that there are currently several quasi - one - dimensional magnetic materials that are intensely studied as possible candidates for manifestation of unconventional orders , particularly @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , and @xmath15-@xmath16 ( @xmath17-@xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "we have previously studied @xcite the spin current correlations in frustrated chains with the spin @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and have shown that the behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath19 chains was very different .",

    "the goal of the present paper is to answer this question . for that purpose ,",
    "we numerically study the spin current in isotropic spin-@xmath0 zigzag chains with the spin up to @xmath20 .",

    "the use of @xmath86 symmetry allows one to reduce substantially the number of states @xmath88 which is necessary to describe the system : essentially , one treats the multiplet of states of the same total spin as a single representative state .",
    "a slight disadvantage is that the non - abelian method allows to compute only reduced matrix elements ( in the sense of the wigner - eckart theorem ) .",
    "since the spin current is a vector , the available correlator that is easily available is the rotationally invariant scalar product @xmath89 , which is a mixture of the longitudinal and transversal spin current correlations .",
