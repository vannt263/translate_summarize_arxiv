    "in the recent past , rapid interest has been developed in the discipline of quantum information @xcite that has led to the creation of quantum game theory [ 2 - 5 ] . during last few years",
    ", tremendous efforts have been made towards the development of quantum game theory [ 6 - 12 ] . in this connection",
    ", much work has been devoted to convert the classical games into quantum domain such as prisoners dilemma game [ 13 - 15 ] and many other games [ 16 - 20 ] involving two and three players . quantum games with @xmath0 payoff matrices and larger have have been discussed by wang et al . [ 21 ] .",
    "recently , sousa et al .",
    "[ 22 ] have proposed that quantum games can be used to control the access of processes to the cpu in a quantum computer .",
    "more recently , iqbal and abbott [ 23 ] have reported that quantum games can directly be constructed from a system of bell s inequalities using arthur fine s analysis .    in quantum information processing ,",
    "the major problem is to faithfully transmit unknown quantum states through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "when quantum information is sent through a channel , the carriers of the information interact with the channel and get entangled with its many degrees of freedom .",
    "this gives rise to the phenomenon of decoherence on the state space of the information carriers .",
    "in real - world applications , the decoherence effects caused by the external environment are inevitable . quantum channels [ 1 ] provide a natural theoretical framework for the study of decoherence in noisy quantum communication systems .",
    "quantum games in the presence of decoherence have been discussed in the recent past by various authors [ 5 , 24 - 26 ] .",
    "recently , decoherence and correlated noise ( memory ) effects have been analyzed in different quantum games [ 8 , 20 , 27 ] .",
    "quantum error correction [ 28 - 29 ] and entanglement purifications [ 30].can be employed to avoid the problem of decoherence .    in this paper , we study the effect of quantum noise in a 2-player 3-strategy entangled quantum game ( @xmath5 game ) .",
    "we consider different noisy channels parameterized by a quantum noise parameter @xmath6 such that @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the lower and upper limits of quantum noise parameter represent the fully coherent and fully decohered systems , respectively .",
    "it is seen that for maximum value of quantum noise parameter the game behaves as a noiseless game .",
    "the depolarizing channel influences the game s payoff more heavily as compared to the amplitude damping channel . the payoff function for amplitude damping channel , is symmetrical with its minimum at @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the phase damping channel does not influence the game .",
    "the rock , scissors and paper game is a game for two players typically played using the players hands .",
    "it is a simple two - player , three - strategy game , the children s choosing game rock ( @xmath1 ) , scissors ( @xmath2 ) and paper ( @xmath3 )  denoted by @xmath5 , in which rock beats scissors , scissors beats paper , and paper beats rock @xmath9 . the classical payoff matrix for this game is given in table 1 . since @xmath5 game is a zero - sum game , therefore it has no pure strategy nash equilibrium .",
    "however , the mixed strategy nash equilibrium produces zero expected payoff for the classical game .",
    "quantum analog of the @xmath5 game was formulated by iqbal et al .",
    "[ 12 ] and michael et al .",
    "[ 31 ] . in the quantum version of this game ,",
    "the strategies @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are represented by three matrices ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 equation 9 ref . [ 31 ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 is the unitary matrix which is used to transform the initial qutrit state of the game .",
    "we assume that initially alice and bob share a maximally entangled two qutrit state of the form    @xmath14    we can define the strategies of the players by the unitary operator @xmath15 of the form [ 31 ] @xmath16\\]]where @xmath17 @xmath18 and the choice of @xmath19 and @xmath20 define a player s mixed strategy in a @xmath0 game , just as the choice of @xmath21 does in the @xmath22 game [ 3 ] .",
    "the interaction between the system and its environment introduces the decoherence to the system , which is a process of the undesired correlation between the system and the environment when the system evolves .",
    "the evolution of a state of a quantum system in a noisy environment can be described by the super - operator @xmath23 in the kraus operator representation [ 1 ] as    @xmath24    where the kraus operators @xmath25 satisfy the following completeness relation    @xmath26    we have constructed the kraus operators for the game from the single qutrit kraus operators ( as given in equations ( 6 - 9 ) below ) by taking their tensor product over all @xmath27 combination of @xmath28 indices    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the number of kraus operators for a single qutrit channel .",

    "we obtain a single curve for all the three channels ( the phase damping channel curve in figures 2 and 3 ) .",
