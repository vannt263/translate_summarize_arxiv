    "+ observations of sne iin published to date ( see e.g. , @xcite ) have allowed researchers to probe the immediate environment of these explosions and point towards significant diversity among various sne  iin .",
    "the high mass  loss rates calculated from the observations of various sne  iin ( e.g. , @xcite ) have prompted several authors to assign luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) in several cases as immediate progenitors of sne  iin .",
    "lbvs , as defined by @xcite , are some of the most luminous stars , with episodic and violent mass  loss events with mass  loss rates @xmath10 yr@xmath7 .",
    "classic examples of lbvs are eta carinae and p  cygni .",
    "the direct detection of the extremely luminous progenitor of sn  2005gl @xcite also supports this possibility .",
    "however , in stellar evolutionary models , the lbv phase follows a blue giant star state @xcite , most likely with mass loss driven by the bi ",
    "stability jump @xcite , and it is then followed by a h  poor wn star ( nitrogen rich wolf ",
    "rayet ) . in this scenario",
    "the lbv star loses its h envelope , becomes a wolf ",
    "rayet star and then explodes as a sn .",
    "thus , lbvs have been placed as a post ",
    "main sequence , but not a final pre  sn phase @xcite , although see @xcite for recent modeling suggesting that some stars could indeed end their lives during this phase .",
    "+ there have been a number of cases where transients have originally been defined as sne  iin , but a link to a definitive sn event ( i.e. the terminal stage of a star s life ) is questionable .",
    "such events have been defined as sn `` impostors '' @xcite which are believed to be luminous non  terminal eruptions of massive stars instead of sne .",
    "there are multiple cases of such events e.g. , the on  going transient sn  2009ip ( @xcite ) .",
    "sn  impostors are generally claimed to be lbv transients with peak luminosities lower than sne ( @xmath11 ) , such as sn  1997bs ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) , sn  2000ch ( @xmath13 ; @xcite ) , sn  2002 kg ( @xmath14 ; @xcite ) , sn  2007sv ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) , sn 2008s ( @xmath16 ; @xcite , and 2008 ngc 300-ot ( @xmath17 ; a@xcite ( see also the compilation paper by @xcite ) .",
    "however , unambiguous evidence that all transients classified as `` impostors '' are actually non  terminal events is lacking .",
    "indeed for the first transient identified as a sn  impostor , sn  1997bs , it has been claimed that no surviving star is present @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that the scenario where the surviving star is obscured by dust created in the eruption is excluded . + given that sn  impostors and sne  iin show similar spectroscopic features , such as the presence of narrow emission lines ( in particular lines ) , the differentiation based solely on spectral analysis is rendered difficult , and constraining the nature of their progenitors ( e.g. , zams mass ) has been problematic .",
    "indeed , the detection of narrow emission lines is merely evidence for high density material close to the sn and it appears that this high density csm can be produced by a number of different progenitor scenarios .",
    "indeed , it has even been observed in sne  ia ( e.g. , sn  2002ic @xcite , sn  2011kx @xcite ) . +",
    "while observations of individual sne iin have been used to argue for lbv progenitors or lbv transients , statistical investigations of their environments within host galaxies have pointed to lower mass progenitors . @xcite and @xcite found a low correlation between sne  iin and host  galaxy regions .",
    "it was found that sne  iin show a similar degree of association with star formation ( sf ) as sne  iip , which are thought to arise from stars at the lower end of the cc sne scale ; with masses between 816 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "therefore , these results suggest that a significant fraction of sne  iin arise from relatively low mass progenitors .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given that the lbv phase is thought to be associated only with very massive stars ( @xmath18 3080 @xmath4 ) .",
    "contrary to the above , we note that recent results suggest that a significant fraction of sne  iin could arise from electron capture sne @xcite with agb progenitor stars ( @xcite ) . also , @xcite argue that lbv stars are the product of binary kicks , due to their isolated environments .",
    "+ in this paper we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the transient sn  2011a , originally classified as a sn  iin @xcite . given the properties of the transient we discuss its characteristics in comparison to other sn  iin and sn  impostors with the aim of defining the nature of the transient and constraining its properties . due to the fact that it is unclear whether sn  2011a was a true sn , we refer to it as `` transient '' throughout the paper .",

    "it is therefore difficult to differentiate between a sn  iin or sn  impostor origin for this transient using solely its @xmath63 .",
    "+      as expected for an interacting transient , the spectral sequence presented in fig .",
    "3 is dominated by relatively narrow h@xmath1 emission",
    ". however , there is significant evolution with time , as will now be discussed .      the spectrum with the highest resolution taken close to discovery ( + 2.4 days ) ,",
    "is dominated by balmer lines , most prominently h@xmath1 and h@xmath66 in emission , with a characteristic width of @xmath182400 km s@xmath7 measured using the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) . in what follows",
    "we will refer to these lines as `` broad '' , although the reader should keep in mind that these velocities are much lower than what is observed in most sne ii ( @xmath67 @xmath68 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "we observe also many narrow ( @xmath18 5001000 km s@xmath7 ) p  cygni profiles attributed to @xmath69 , the near  infrared triplet @xmath70 , and many lines .",
    "after @xmath18 day 50 , h@xmath1 emission is still present but h@xmath66 is significantly weaker . we see a similar evolution of the lines which are present during the first few days , but disappear from day 56.8 onwards .",
    "the triplet is not clearly seen in spectra between days 56.8 and 85.9 due to noisy data but is still visible on the + 98.5 day spectrum , and possibly 144.7 days after discovery .",
    "+    to understand sne  iin , it is common practice to analyse the h@xmath1 line profile and its evolution .",
    "this is shown in fig .  5 where we see considerable temporal variations .",
    "indeed , from discovery to 56.8 days later , our spectra are characterised by prominent `` broad '' emission ( @xmath67 @xmath71 km s@xmath7 )",
    ". then between 56.8 days and 85.9 days post discovery , a narrow low  velocity ( 6001100 km s@xmath7 ) p  cygni absorption appears .",
    "after day 85.9 we see again a `` broad '' emission with no signs of the p  cygni profile .",
    "again , we emphasize the absence in the spectra at all epochs of any kind of high velocity components ( @xmath72 km s@xmath7 ) characteristic of sn ejecta . +    in fig .  6 we show the h@xmath1 line evolution splitting it into epochs with and without p  cygni profiles .",
    "cygni component is seen in spectra obtained on days + 56.8 , + 64.0 , + 70.0 , and + 80.9 .",
    "the blueshifted absorption velocity has values between 575 km s@xmath7 to 1060 km s@xmath7 .",
    "it is unlikely that these low  velocity p  cygni profiles can be attributed to the ejecta , which is expected to have velocities of several thousand km s@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we argue that this p  cygni component is related to a pre - sn wind . the wind velocity is consistent with an lbv progenitor ( 100  1000 km s@xmath7 @xcite ) ; but too high for red supergiants ( 20  40 km s@xmath7 ; @xcite ) and possibly too low for wolf  rayet stars ( 1000  5000 km s@xmath7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our first spectra , taken 2.0 days and 2.4 days after discovery , show many strong features with p",
    " cygni profiles . the velocity measured with respect to the emission from the multiplet @xmath73 lines in the + 2.4 day spectrum is between 430 - 460 km s@xmath7 , arguing for a csm rather than ejecta origin .",
    "we also note that these velocities have the same order of magnitude as those derived from the h@xmath1 p  cygni component .",
    "the same is seen in the red part with the calcium triplet @xmath70 . indeed in the + 2.4 day spectrum we measured low velocity with respect to the emission ( @xmath18 @xmath74 km s@xmath7 ) , again supporting the hypothesis of csm origin and",
    "consistent with the velocities derived from the lines .",
    "looking at the continuum we can also estimate the temperature through a blackbody fit .",
    "the temperature evolution shows a rapid decline from @xmath75 9000 k in the + 2.0 days spectrum to @xmath75 5000 k in the + 56.8 days spectrum and to @xmath75 3300 k at the later epochs .",
    "as seen in the type iin sn  1994w @xcite , we observe a strong absorption near the d doublet wavelength ( @xmath51 ) which becomes stronger with time and has low velocity .",
    "this is shown in fig .  7 , where the evolution of this feature is presented .",
    "the equivalent width and velocity of the line profile were calculated for each epoch . because the majority of our spectra were taken in low resolution",
    ", the sodium doublet is unresolved , hence , we will refer to this feature as absorption at the wavelength of d , due to the fact that the d can be blended with the @xmath76 line ( we also note the possible presence of at the wavelength @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the 2.4 days spectrum ) .",
    "therefore the total blended doublet is measured as a single line . in fig .",
    "8 we present both the equivalent width and velocity evolution and see that the absorption becomes stronger with time .",
    "indeed the equivalent width is initially equal to @xmath18 3     and increases to 10     after the first 70.0 days . at the same time , the feature profile evolves . in the first two spectra ,",
    "only an absorption line is observed while , between days 56.8 and 110.3 a p  cygni profile appears .",
    "the velocities are measured from the d center , 5892     with respect to the emission are shown in table 4 .",
    "8 also shows the average d equivalent widths from ism for all the _ carnegie supernova project _",
    "( csp ; @xcite ) sne  ii ( as used in @xcite ) .",
    "we measure the equivalent width for each sn regardless of the epoch and we averaged these values .",
    "this is again further evidence of a csm origin for this line : the strength is much higher than seen in any other sne  ii from the csp database .",
    "even if the low resolution spectra prevent us to be sure that the measured absorption close to d position is only due to d and not blending with other lines , the absorption strength is unprecedented .",

    "indeed the broad component velocity was estimated to 2000 km s@xmath7 ( 1971 km s@xmath7 for sn  2011a ) , an intermediate component velocity of 600800 km s@xmath7 ( 467 km s@xmath7 for sn  2011a ) and a narrow component velocity of 120150 km s@xmath7 ( 107 km s@xmath7 for sn  2011a ) . in their paper",
    ", they conclude that the transient sn  2007sv is most likely a sn  impostor , based mainly on its absolute magnitude .",
    "note that the absolute magnitude derived for this transient is @xmath18  2 mag fainter than sn  2011a",
    ". +    note that from the gaussian decomposition of the highest resolution spectrum we can calculate the progenitor mass  loss rate using the following formula @xcite :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the efficiency of the conversion of mechanical energy into optical energy in the shock wave ( we adopt as @xcite , @xmath80= 0.1 ) .",
    "@xmath81 is the mass loss rate , @xmath82 is the unshocked wind velocity derived as described above and @xmath83 is the shock velocity .",
    "the shock velocity was taken as the fhwm of the intermediate width component .",
    "the absolute @xmath84 was then obtained by integrating over the intermediate width feature and taking account of the distance to the sn .",
    "we used the same luminosity distance used above , i.e , 36.70 mpc .",
    "we found @xmath81 = 0.038 m@xmath85 yr@xmath7 with a wind velocity of 110 km s@xmath7 and a shock velocity about 470 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this mass loss rate is consistent with values found by @xcite and is too high for any class of massive stars other than lbvs in the eruptive phase @xcite .",
    "sn  2011a shows a number of interesting properties . in order to understand the nature of the transient , we compare in this section our object with other interacting transients .",
    "we discuss the transient in comparison to other events which possibly show similarities .",
    "however , in any case where similarities exist , we show that there are other features which confirm the uniqueness of sn  2011a .",
    "+        as stated in the introduction , the sn  iin group is very heterogeneous , in terms of luminosity , light curve shape and spectral evolution .",
    "based on @xcite who proposed to differentiate sne  iin according to their photometric and spectroscopic characteristics , @xcite identify a subclass of sne  iin in which they included sn  2009kn @xcite , sn  1994w @xcite and sn 2005cl @xcite . to see",
    "if sn  2011a shares common properties with these sne and belongs to this subclass , we compare the light curves and spectra ( see section 4.2.2 ) .",
    "we also include comparison with sn  1998s @xcite a well studied sn  iin , sn  2005kj @xcite which , similarly to sn  2011a shows evidence of low velocity absorption at d wavelengths , sn  1997bs @xcite classified as sn  impostor ( note that we compare in more detail sn  2011a and sn  1997bs in the section 4.1.2 . ) , and sn  2007sv , also recently classified as an sn  impostor @xcite .",
    "these comparisons are shown in fig .",
    "10 , where the @xmath30band light curves are plotted .",
    "note that we do not present the sn  1994w light curve due to the lack of data and because it is very similar to sn  2009kn @xcite . as we can see in fig .",
    "10 sn  2009kn is brighter than sn  2011a with @xmath63 @xmath86 @xmath3717.5/@xmath3718 and the sn  2009kn light curve does not show a double plateau like sn  2011a . indeed , after an initially declining plateau phase with a slope equal to 0.018 mag day@xmath7 , we see a quick fall around 0.08 mag day@xmath7 followed by a slow decline phase with a slope of @xmath18 1 mag 100  days@xmath7 .",
    "however , the photometry of sn  2009kn does not cover the first few tens of days from the assumed explosion date . as can be seen in fig .",
    "10 , sn  2011a is photometrically very different that the other sne  iin .",
    "none of the other selected sne  iin show a double plateau and they are all @xmath3 2 mag brighter than sn  2011a .",
    "also we remark that sn  2011a is @xmath18 2 mag brighter than the sn  impostors .",
    "10 allows us to conclude that sn  2011a is a very rare event which does not share any similarities in the light curve with other sn  1994w  like sne  iin . an important additional point to note is the origin of the two sne  iin ; sn  1994w and sn  2009kn used to compare sn  2011a to other sne  iin .",
    "indeed the origin is not so clear , for example @xcite argued that maybe sn  1994w was not a sn , but rather the result of two interacting shells of material related to lbv  like eruptions .",
    "also , in the case of sn  2009kn @xcite a non  sn origin could not be completely excluded , but also found the observations to be consistent with an electron capture sn .",
    "we note that later an argument will be presented that constrains the epoch of the photometry of sn  2011a to be @xmath18 50 days later than shown in fig .  10",
    ". however , the main conclusions remain valid : sn  2011a has a luminosity between the two classes of interacting transients , sne  iin and sn impostors ; this event shows a rare double plateau .     +    in fig .",
    "11 we present the optical colours of sn  2011a together with the colour evolution of sn  2009kn , one sn  1994w  like , and the well - studied sn  1998s .",
    "we do not present the sn  1994w and sn 2005cl colours due to the lack of data .",
    "all magnitudes were corrected for milky way extinction .",
    "taking the discovery date as the explosion date , the colour evolution of sn  2011a looks fairly similar to sn  1998s .",
    "indeed , the @xmath42 colour becomes redder in sn  1998s between days 0 and 60 .",
    "however , in @xmath43 , sn  1998s does not show an initial plateau as sn  2011a .",
    "+    the colour evolution of sn  2009kn looks similar to sn  2011a in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , but shifted by @xmath18 50 days .",
    "this could be explained by the lack of precision in the explosion date for sn  2011a .",
    "if we shift our epochs by 50 days ( motivated by the spectral analysis in section 4.2.1 ) , the colour evolution in @xmath42 and @xmath43 is very similar to sn  2009kn . indeed for @xmath43 ,",
    "sn  2009kn shows a small plateau during @xmath18 50 days and then an increase from 0.3 to 0.7 mag .",
    "it is more difficult to compare the behavior of the @xmath44 colour , due to their larger errors , however we can see the same trend : for sn  2011a , @xmath44 increases from @xmath87 to @xmath88 mag in 100 days , and for sn  2009kn , @xmath44 increases from @xmath89 to @xmath90 mag in the same temporal windows .",
    "the colours between sn  2011a and sn  2009kn are very similar , but shifted by 50 days which could be consistent with the hypothesis proposed in section 4.2.1 , namely , that the explosion date is not close to the discovery date but more consistent with 50 days earlier .",
    "the light curve comparison between sn  2011a and sn  1997bs ( which was classified as a sn  impostor by @xcite ) shows similarities .",
    "the light curves of both objects in @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 bands are shown in fig .",
    "for the sn  1997bs explosion date , we choose 1997 april 15th ( ut discovery date ) , which should be valid because an image taken on 1997 april 10th does not show anything at the location of the sn . during the first 15 days of evolution in @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands both objects exhibit a plateau .",
    "after this first plateau the two transients show a second plateau but the drop between the two is much larger for sn  1997bs : @xmath18 0.5 mag for sn  2011a and @xmath18 1 mag for sn  1997bs in @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 bands have also some similarities .",
    "note , while the light curve evolution displayed in fig .",
    "12 appears very similar , this may be coincidental given the uncertainty of the sn  2011a explosion date .",
    "however , the important observation is the similar double plateau features in both light curves , which may be evidence for the same underlying mechanism ; namely interaction with two separate csm shells .",
    "the optical colours of sn  2011a compared with sn  1997bs are presented in fig .",
    "13 . from the @xmath42 colour",
    "we can compare the colours near maximum .",
    "for sn  2011a we find @xmath18 0.25 mag whereas for sn  1997bs @xcite found 0.67 mag , adding a host extinction for 1997bs .",
    "additionally we can compare the colour evolution .",
    "in the @xmath43 colour , the evolution looks similar during the first 30 days . for sn  1997bs ,",
    "a plateau at 0.3 mag during 30 days is seen and then a reddening as for sn  2011a .",
    "but in sn  2011a the plateau lasts 50 days . despite the noise",
    ", @xmath42 colour exhibits the same trend with a plateau during 20 days and then a reddening .",
    "again , in @xmath44 , sn  2011a and the sn  impostor show the same evolution with a reddening during the first 40 days .",
    "although the data are noisy the shape of the reddening is pretty similar .",
    "finally , note that the sn  impostor nature of sn  1997bs is not entirely clear as there is some evidence that the progenitor did not survive to the explosion @xcite .",
    "hence , while sn  2011a shows similarities to sn  1997bs , this is not concluding proof that the former was an imposter event .",
    "one diagnostic to discriminate between sne and sn  impostors is the amount of synthesized @xmath92 . for low mass core ",
    "collapse sne ( sne  iip ) one expects to find a @xmath91ni mass around 0.0016 ",
    "0.26 @xmath4 @xcite whereas for non  terminal explosions we do not except any @xmath91ni production because only the outer layers of the star are ejected . for very massive ccsne produced by progenitors with initial masses between 30  100 @xmath4 , @xmath91ni masses between 2.3  6.6 @xmath4 have been predicted @xcite , and masses between 0.07  0.6 @xmath4 have been estimated for progenitor masses between 16  46 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we can obtain a @xmath91ni mass estimate using the formula from @xcite and the last @xmath30band magnitude ( epoch 97.6 days ) .",
    "this value should be taken as an upper limit of the @xmath91ni mass because the spectrum at this epoch does not indicate that the emission is being solely powered by radioactivity . indeed in this spectrum narrow",
    "lines are still present due to interaction .",
    "+    as stated previously the explosion date is not well constrained and could be 50 days before discovery .",
    "therefore the @xmath91ni mass is calculated assuming the explosion date as the discovery date and also using an explosion date 50 days before discovery .",
    "we find 0.01 ",
    "0.015 @xmath4 without extinction and 0.03  0.05 @xmath4 with extinction . in both cases",
    "the upper value is using an explosion date 50 days before discovery .",
    "these values are consistent with @xcite and lower than @xcite . indeed hamuy ( 2003 ) found for sne  ii values between 0.0016  0.26 @xmath4 and mazzali et al .",
    "values between 0.07  0.6 @xmath4 .",
    "if we apply this same approach to sn  1997bs , we find a @xmath91ni of 0.003 @xmath4 based on the @xmath30band magnitude measured 63.5 days after discovery . in conclusion",
    "it is very difficult to set significant constraints on the nature of sn  2011a based on these uncertain @xmath91ni mass estimates .",
    "unfortunately , the explosion date of sn  2011a is not well determined by pre  explosion images .",
    "a fit to the early time spectrum with a blackbody function yields a high temperature ( @xmath18 10000 k ) , thus suggesting that the observations possibly began soon after explosion .",
    "however , given the interacting nature of sn  2011a , it is unclear how valid such a constraint is .",
    "to better estimate this parameter , we compare sn  2011a with two other sne with well  constrained explosion times .",
    "+    firstly , sn  1994w @xcite , for which @xcite estimated from its @xmath31band data a precise explosion date of 1994 july @xmath93 . in fig .",
    "14 we compare our spectrum taken 2.0 days after discovery with a sn  1994w spectrum taken 57 days after explosion .",
    "as we can see , the spectra are remarkably similar .",
    "a blue continuum characterizes both spectra and the slope / shape are nearly identical .",
    "also , both sne show strong multiplet @xmath73 lines with low velocity ( @xmath18 hundreds km s@xmath7 ) p  cygni profiles ( fig .  14 , top right ) .",
    "we also distinguish in the blue part of the spectrum a strong absorption attributed to caii @xmath69 .",
    "sn  2011a shows two noticeable differences from sn  1994w : ( 1 ) the near - infrared triplet is more prominent than in sn  1994w and ( 2 ) sn  1994w shows a narrow p ",
    "cygni absorption on top of the broad of h@xmath1 component whereas in sn  2011a this feature is not seen and only appears in the spectrum taken + 56.8 days after discovery . +    secondly , in fig .",
    "15 we compare our + 2.0 day spectrum with the sn  1997bs spectrum taken on 1997 april 16th ( day + 1 after discovery ) to search for similarities as seen in their light curves .",
    "given that the non  detection was very close to discovery , the explosion date is well constrained for sn  1997bs .",
    "the continua look very similar when we apply a total reddening of @xmath94 = 0.24 mag to sn  1997bs ( @xcite estimated this total color excess at 0.21 mag ) and null for sn  2011a .",
    "we choose this colour excess value to match the two continua .",
    "the spectra show some differences , most notably the lack of narrow p ",
    "cygni lines in sn  1997bs .",
    "in contrast , their h@xmath1 emission profiles are virtually identical .",
    "note also that if these spectra were taken at similar epochs then this would imply that the host  galaxy extinction for sn  2011a is less than that of sn  1997bs . for sn",
    "1997bs @xcite derived an total extinction @xmath59 @xmath18 0.65 mag .",
    "this value is close to that found for sn  2011a in section 3.1.3 but not significantly lower .",
    "+ thanks to these comparisons and the fact that our spectrum taken 2.0 days after discovery has a good match with the sn  1994w spectrum taken 57 days past explosion , it is possible that sn  2011a maybe exploded @xmath18 50 days before discovery .",
    "indeed in both spectra we can see the presence of the same elements with identical line profile , such as the multiplet @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that the physical conditions for both spectra were similar and assuming that the evolution is not so different , the epochs are likely similar .",
    "this explosion date would then make the colour curve between sn  2009kn and sn  2011a consistent ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "while the light curves are very similar between sn  2011a and sn  1997bs these are most likely related to csm shells , and therefore any explosion date estimation is less reliable ; the explosion date estimation from spectral comparisons is likely to be more valid .",
    "d absorption can have three origins .",
    "from the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the line of sight , the circumstellar material ejected by the progenitor ionized by the radiation from the sn and recombined over the following several days to weeks , or from the sn ejecta .",
    "the main distinguishing feature between these three components is the velocity .",
    "if the absorption is due to the ism , the velocity will be very low , @xmath18 2  15 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if the component comes from the csm , the velocity will be higher ( few hundred km s@xmath7 as for sn  2011a ) and depends on the progenitor .",
    "finally , the component from a sn ejecta would have the highest values of a few thousand km s@xmath7 .",
    "though the majority of spectra are low resolution and prevent us to resolve the d absorption line , we believe that the absorption close to the d wavelength position is mostly due to d. even if some lines like @xmath95 can be blended with the d , the absorption strength and velocity are very rare . indeed others sne have shown similar remarkable increase of d absorption , such as sn 1998a and sn  2009e @xcite , but @xcite measured for sn  2009e the d velocity and found a value of @xmath18 30005000 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the absorption line is due the sn ejecta , whereas the velocities measured for d absorption in sn  2011a never gets higher than 1100 km s@xmath7 , inconsistent with an ejecta origin , but consistent with a csm origin interpretation .",
    "+    in the literature we found a small number of cases of csm d in sne  iin . indeed for sn",
    "2009kn @xcite , sn  1994w @xcite , sn  1997bs @xcite , and sn  2005kj @xcite , the velocity is low as for sn  2011a , less than 1100 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the increase of d absorption , according to @xcite , is a result of the increasing ionization fraction .",
    "+      most sn  impostors candidates in the literature have no surviving star at the location of the transient which could contradict the nature of the transient , i.e. , a non  terminal eruptions of massive stars .",
    "however , a simple reason could explain this .",
    "the dust formed in a dense shell ejected by the star will obscures the sn  impostor .",
    "the presence of dust can be deduced by different ways .",
    "first , by the presence of an infrared excess due to the thermal emission from dust condensed in the ejecta or from heated pre  existing dust .",
    "unfortunately we do not have useful infrared data for this transient .",
    "secondly , looking at the emission lines .",
    "if the spectral feature profiles show a blueshift , this can be attributed to the fact that the red side of the ejecta is blocked by the new dust ( @xcite , but see @xcite and @xcite for an alternative explanation ) .",
    "this effect is maybe seen in our transient . indeed in fig .  5 where the h@xmath1 emission line evolution is shown ,",
    "we can see for the spectrum + 111.8 days that the red side is weaker compared to the blue part .",
    "this characteristic is not clearly observed after and before this epoch especially due to the appearance of a p  cygni profile .",
    "+    the estimated black body temperature at late times ( 3300k ) is also possibly indicative of dust formation .",
    "this is because this temperature appears to be too low for the spectra to be dominated by strong balmer emission lines .",
    "this low temperature could be due to dust formation which reddens the object .",
    "multi - band photometry fitting seems to favor an extincted black body but it is difficult to put strong constraints on the black body temperature and extinction due to the small wavelength baseline and because our transient is mainly powered by interaction which implies that using a black body fitting could be not realistic .",
    "any increase in reddening could also related to the observed increase in d. however we note that the increase in the latter is more likely due to csm effects .",
    "analysing the h@xmath96 emission line evolution with time together with the light curve allows us to constrain csm properties .",
    "the sn  2011a light curve shows a double plateau .",
    "the presence of this rare double plateau leads us to speculate that the csm is composed of two shells ejected by the pre sn wind . during @xmath18 15 days",
    "there is an initial plateau which corresponds to the interaction between the sn blast wave and the first shell",
    ". when the ejecta reaches the edge of the first shell the light curve drops .",
    "if we assume that the blast wave speed is constant and taking the value found in section 3.2.4 , @xmath18 2000 km s@xmath7 , we find a lower limit width of the first shell of @xmath97 cm .",
    "it is a lower limit due to the fact the beginning of this shell is not well constrained ( because of the uncertainty in the explosion date ) .",
    "then , there is another weaker plateau which lasts @xmath18 15 days in the @xmath30 band .",
    "again , assuming that the ejecta velocity is constant with time , we find the width for the second shell , @xmath98 cm . a cartoon showing the csm and the velocities of the different components is presented in fig .",
    ". this scenario would be similar to that proposed by @xcite for sn  1994w .",
    "+    this photometric analysis seems be also consistent with the spectral evolution . in fig .",
    "5 we see that the h@xmath1 profile changes with time , from the very broad component at early epochs during the first plateau phase ( spectra + 2.0 , + 2.4 , and + 14.9 days ) , to a narrower broad component , accompanied with low velocity h@xmath1 absorption ( + 56.8 , + 64 , + 70 , + 80.9 , + 85.9 days ) during and after the second plateau .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of sn  2011a , initially classified as a sn  iin based on the presence of a narrow h@xmath1 emission in the spectrum .",
    "while the exact nature of the transient remains unclear , sn  2011a shows a number of interesting and unusual properties :    1 .",
    "double plateau in light curve likely due to csm composed of two shells .",
    "low luminosity , @xmath3715.10@xmath99 @xmath63 @xmath3 @xmath3715.72 ( depending on assumed host  galaxy extinction , 0 or 0.62 mag in @xmath30band ) .",
    "3 .    low p ",
    "cygni h@xmath1 velocity @xmath100 km s@xmath7 .",
    "low velocity absorption close to d @xmath101 km s@xmath7 .",
    "5 .    variable absorption close to d increasing in strength , from 3 to 10   in equivalent width .",
    "given the photometric and spectroscopic properties we have derived for sn  2011a ; most importantly its low luminosity and low ejecta velocity together with their comparison to other interacting transients , we believe that sn  2011a is most likely an sn  impostor event . however , we also note that our analysis has demonstrated the difficulty in determining whether interacting transients are true terminal events or indeed sn  impostors .",
    "the reader also must keep in mind that the characteristics used to separate the two events are in general arbitrary and hence detailed studies of future events are needed to further elucidate this issue .",

    "<S> this evolution is also accompanied by a change of line profile ; when the absorption becomes stronger , a p  cygni profile appears . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss sn  2011a in the context of interacting sne  iin and sn  impostors , which appears to confirm the uniqueness of this transient . </S>",
    "<S> while we favour an impostor origin for sn  2011a , we highlight the difficulty in differentiating between terminal and non  terminal interacting transients . </S>"
