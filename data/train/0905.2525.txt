    "the black hole masses predicted from the @xmath52 relation are found to be in conflict with those from the @xmath53 relation for high - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. brightest cluster galaxies : bcgs ) , with the former relation predicting a larger black hole mass ( lauer et al .",
    "while this may be explained by the slow increase in @xmath54 with @xmath55 and the more rapid increase in effective radii with @xmath55 seen in bcgs as compared to less luminous galaxies , the authors argued that the @xmath56 relationship is a plausible description for galaxies of high luminosity . from the major galaxy merger simulations , hopkins et al .",
