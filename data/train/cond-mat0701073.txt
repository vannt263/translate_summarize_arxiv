    "the need of regulating the behavior of large ensembles of interacting units is a common feature of many physical , social and biological networks .",
    "for instance , many regulatory mechanisms have been uncovered in the context of biological , physiological and cellular processes , which are fundamental to guarantee the correct functioning of the whole network @xcite .",
    "examples include , in physiology , the synchronous beat of heart cells whose rhythm is generated by pacemaker cells situated at the sinoatrial node @xcite , the control of the respiratory rhythm played by synaptically coupled pacemaker neurons in the medulla @xcite and the generation of rhythmic pacemaker currents by networks of interstitial cells of cajal in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals @xcite . in social networks ,",
    "opinion dynamics are often driven by key - individuals termed as _ opinion leaders _",
    "other relevant examples , in biology , are the mechanisms through which cell cycles are controlled @xcite and synchronized @xcite .    understanding the fundamental nature of such regulatory mechanisms",
    "is therefore of utmost importance in physics and applied science . _",
    "pinning control _ has been proposed in the literature @xcite as a fitting model to provide an insight into the regulatory mechanisms to control lattices and networks of coupled dynamical systems .",
    "the general idea behind pinning control is a self - feedback action ( over a given reference evolution ) , acting on a limited subset of the dynamical systems placed at the network nodes .",
    "these nodes , also termed as reference sites or pinned sites , play the role of network _",
    "leaders_/_pacemakers_. specifically , a direct control action is active only on these nodes and is propagated to the rest of the network through the coupling among the vertices . in this paper , we define the new concept of _ pinning - controllability _ ( different from synchronizability ) and derive a new quantity to assess this property for physical networks of interest .",
    "these findings have immediate theoretical and experimental relevance . by evaluating the pinning - controllability of a given network",
    ", one could decide the effectiveness of a pinning control strategy in terms of the strength of the required control action , the number of nodes to be pinned and the effects that a given topology of feedback connections can have on the entire network .",
    "the rest of the paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the pinning control formalism , apt to describing dynamical complex networks subject to a decentralized control action . in sec .",
    "iii a new methodology ( based on the master stability function approach @xcite ) is introduced to define the pinning - controllability of a given complex network of interest .",
    "finally , a validation is presented in sec .",
    "iv , where pinning control of scale - free complex networks of chaotic oscillators is studied through numerical simulations .",
    "in recent years , synchronization of complex networks of coupled oscillators has been the subject of intensive research activity within the scientific community .",
    "a common assumption in such literature is that all the dynamical systems at the network nodes are identical , while the problem of synchronization of networks of non - identical oscillators has received much less attention .",
    "in particular , the master stability function ( msf ) approach , introduced in @xcite , has been successfully applied to synchronization of complex networks in a wide variety of situations ( see e.g. @xcite , to name a few contributions ) . note that the msf approach is valid under the hypothesis that all the vector fields at the network dynamical nodes are identical .    in this paper , we study networks in which two different layers of dynamical nodes coexist : the uncontrolled sites and the reference ( controlled ) ones . in particular ,",
    "the latter plays the role of leading the whole network towards a given ( desired ) reference evolution .",
    "generally , we assume the controlled complex network to be described by the following set of equations : @xmath0 @xmath1 , representing the behavior of @xmath2 identical dynamical systems coupled through the network edges .    the first term on the right side of ( [ eq : net2 ] ) describes the state dynamics of the oscillator at each node , @xmath3 , via the nonlinear vector field @xmath4 ; the second term represents the coupling among pairs of connected oscillators , through a generic output function @xmath5 , where the coupling gain @xmath6 represents the overall strength of the interaction .",
    "information about the weighed network topology is contained in the coupling matrix @xmath7 , whose entries @xmath8 , are zero if node @xmath9 is not connected to node @xmath10 , but are positive if there is a direct influence from node @xmath9 to node @xmath11 , with @xmath12 giving a measure of the strength of the interaction . in",
    "what follows , we assume the matrix @xmath13 to be irreducible ( i.e. the associated digraph is globally connected ) .",
    "the last term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : net2 ] ) represents the pinning control action .",
    "this term is present only for @xmath14 ( usually @xmath15 ) _ pinned _ nodes in the network , identified by the set @xmath16 . as commonly assumed in _ pinning control _",
    "schemes , such nodes play the role of leading the others towards some desired reference evolution , say @xmath17 .",
    "note that the control input @xmath18 has a direct influence only on the nodes belonging to the set of the reference sites @xmath19 .",
    "in what follows , we consider two different strategies for choosing the pinned nodes : ( i ) _ random pinning _ : the @xmath20 pinned nodes are randomly selected with uniform probability from the set of all the network vertices . (",
    "ii ) _ selective pinning _ :",
    "the @xmath20 pinned nodes are firstly sorted according to a certain property at the network vertices ( for instance , the vertex degree or betweenness centrality ) , then the nodes to be pinned are chosen in that particular order .    hereafter , following @xcite , we choose the control input @xmath21 to be generated by a simple state - feedback law with respect to the reference evolution @xmath17 , which is assumed to satisfy @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we set @xmath23 at every pinned node @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the control gain acting on node @xmath24 .",
    "( [ eq : net2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath27 @xmath1 , where the elements of the _ laplacian _ matrix @xmath28 , are as follows : @xmath29 if @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "denote by @xmath33 the set of eigenvalues of @xmath28 and assume they are ordered in such a way that @xmath34 .",
    "note that in the specific case where @xmath35 , i.e. no reference sites are present in the network , it is possible to define the _ synchronization manifold _ , @xmath36 , which is an invariant set for system ( [ eq : net3 ] ) @xcite . in this case , according to the choice of the coupling gain @xmath6 , all the oscillators in the network may settle over a solution belonging to @xmath37 ( not known _ a priori _ ) and the network becomes synchronized .",
    "interestingly , in @xcite , the stability of the manifold @xmath37 was related to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , suggesting an evaluation of the _ synchronizability _ of a generic network topology in terms of its spectrum . in particular ,",
    "a network is said to be more ( or less ) synchronizable according to the width of the range of values of the coupling gain @xmath6 for which synchronization is attained .",
    "a different problem consists , instead , in driving a network of coupled dynamical systems towards a desired evolution determined _ a priori _ , by means of an appropriate control action .",
    "this is the case where @xmath40 , indicating the presence of some closed - loop equations within the set @xmath41 in ( [ eq : net3 ] ) .",
    "note that when @xmath40 , the evolution @xmath42 becomes the only admissible solution in @xmath37 for the controlled network described by ( [ eq : net3 ] ) .",
    "thus , it is important to study the stability of such a solution , which corresponds in this context to the model reference chosen for the network .",
    "it is worth noting here that the master stability function approach can not be applied directly to network ( [ eq : net3 ] ) , because of the presence of inhomogeneous dynamics at the controlled / uncontrolled nodes . in the next section",
    "we will provide an extension of the msf approach to the case of dynamical networks subject to pinning control , described by the set of equations ( [ eq : net3 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we propose for the first time that the approach presented in @xcite can be extended to define and assess the _ pinning - controllability _ of a given network of interest . in particular , given a network described by ( [ eq : net3 ] ) , we define the network pinning - controllability in terms of the values of the coupling gain @xmath6 and the control gains @xmath26 , @xmath25 , in ( [ eq : net3 ] ) , needed in order for the network to achieve the desired evolution @xmath22 .",
    "we shall seek to assess the pinning - controllability of network ( [ eq : net3 ] ) by considering an extended network of @xmath43 dynamical systems @xmath44 , where @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in so doing , we assume that the desired common evolution @xmath48 is given by the state evolution of an extra virtual vertex , which is added to the original network . then , we can rewrite ( [ eq : net3 ] ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an @xmath51-dimensional square matrix , with @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 is an asymmetric zero row - sum matrix , with positive values along the main diagonal . at first , let us assume the matrix @xmath7 to be symmetric , which ensures the matrix @xmath55 to be diagonalizable .",
    "can be decomposed in the spectrum of its minor containing its first @xmath2 rows and first @xmath2 columns , which is a symmetric matrix , plus one zero eigenvalue . ] then , let @xmath56 be the eigenvalues of @xmath55 and assume they are ordered in such a way that @xmath57 .",
    "by graph theory and linear algebra , we have @xmath58 @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 is the only null eigenvalue of @xmath55 .",
    "now , the arguments of the master stability function approach @xcite immediately apply to ( [ eq : net ] ) .",
    "in particular , by making use of the msf , we can investigate the stability of the reference evolution , @xmath60 , which can be evaluated in terms of the stability of @xmath43 independent blocks in the parameter @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "once the functional forms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 have been assigned , the msf associates to each value of the complex parameter @xmath65 , the maximum lyapunov exponent of the system in each block .",
    "it can be shown that for a large class of systems ( in terms of the dynamic function @xmath63 and the output function @xmath64 ) , there exists a bounded zone of the complex plane centered on the real axis , for which the msf is negative .",
    "thus , the condition to be satisfied , in order to guarantee the stability of the desired common solution @xmath17 , is that all the @xmath66 , @xmath67 , belong to the bounded region of the complex plane where the msf is negative @xcite .",
    "namely , for a given form of the matrix @xmath55 , there is typically a finite range of values of @xmath6 , say @xmath68 , for which the stability of the synchronous state can be achieved .",
    "hence , the spectrum of @xmath55 affects the stability of the synchronization manifold . in this paper , we focus on the case that @xmath55 has a real spectrum .",
    "then , the lower the eigenratio @xmath69 , the larger the @xmath68 @xcite . more generally , when the laplacian matrix has a complex spectrum , it has been proposed that the width of @xmath68 can be evaluated in terms of both @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "namely , the condition on the maximum imaginary part of the spectrum gives information about the spread of the eigenvalues along the direction of the imaginary axis ; in the limit of @xmath71 , the entire spectrum tends to the real axis and the ( best ) condition is recovered that @xmath68 depends only on @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , as explained in @xcite , the same approach can be extended also to the case of @xmath55 being a non - diagonalizable matrix , when the condition is satisfied that the network embeds at least an oriented spanning tree .",
    ", is guaranteed by matrix @xmath73 to be irreducible . ]    now , in the case often considered in the literature of all control gains being the same , i.e. @xmath74 , by rewriting the system in ( [ eq : net ] ) as @xmath75 , for @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , and by noticing that the two matrices @xmath55 and @xmath78 are characterized by the same eigenratios , we obtain , for every choice of @xmath6 , a similar condition on the interval of values of @xmath79 , say @xmath80 , for which the reference evolution is stable ( this is true as long as the maximum imaginary part @xmath81 remains negligible ) .",
    "note that , by taking this approach , we have succeeded in decoupling the dynamical properties of the open - loop network ( in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) from the factors encoded in the matrix @xmath55 . specifically : ( i ) the structural properties of the network , in terms of the original network topology and the choice of the set of the controlled nodes @xmath41 , and ( ii ) the choice for each node in @xmath41 , @xmath82 of the associated control gain @xmath83 .",
    "thus , in analogy to the concept of network synchronizability defined in the literature @xcite , we propose to give a definition of the network _ pinning - controllability _ in terms of the widths of the ranges @xmath68 and @xmath80 , for which the reference evolution @xmath84 is stable .",
    "specifically , the lower the @xmath72 and @xmath81 are , the more the network is pinning - controllable ( note that this definition is independent of the choice of the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) . also , according to this definition , it becomes possible to act on both the network topology as well as the choice of the nodes to pin and their control gains , in order to vary ( and eventually improve ) the network pinning - controllability .",

    ", we evaluate here the effect of @xmath20 pinned nodes with gains @xmath108 , on the structural parameters @xmath72 and @xmath81 . for both the combinatorial and the normalized laplacians considered here ,",
    "the spectra are real and thus @xmath109 .",
    "the main results are shown in fig .",
    "[ main ] , for symmetric and asymmetric topologies . in both cases ,",
    "the eigenratio @xmath72 ( in figs.[main](a ) and [ main](c ) ) is characterized by a minimum around a specific value of the control gain @xmath79 .",
    "this has immediate relevance as it suggests that by appropriately tuning the control gain , it is possible to enhance the pinning - controllability of the network .",
    "specifically , we observe that either a too large or too low value of @xmath79 can reduce the network pinning - controllability .    as shown in figs.[main](a ) and",
    "[ main](c ) , when @xmath93 is low ( @xmath110 in the figure ) , @xmath72 is higher than the eigenratio @xmath111 associated with the corresponding uncontrolled network ( represented by the continuous horizontal lines in fig.[main ] ) .",
    "intuitively this is not surprising since , in order to control the network , we are requiring _ one more _",
    "eigenvalue ( than in the case of generic network synchronization @xcite ) to fall into the stability region of the msf .",
    "note that , for every choice of the coupling gain @xmath6 , the eigenratio @xmath72 may be conveniently varied by choosing an appropriate control gain @xmath79 . at the same time , for every @xmath79 , a bounded region of stability can be defined on the complex plane , and a timely choice of @xmath6 is necessary in order to place all the @xmath66 inside it .",
    "thus , the stability of the reference evolution is sensible to both the values of the control gain and the coupling gain and values of @xmath79 and @xmath6 , which are either too large or too small , may prevent the stability over the reference evolution of the network trajectories .",
    "it is worth noting here that there is a prominent difference between the effects that varying @xmath6 and @xmath79 can have on the pinning - controllability of a given network .",
    "specifically the width of @xmath68 is determined essentially by the particular shape of the msf ( which can be numerically computed , once the forms of the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 are given ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the width of @xmath80 depends on the spectral properties of the matrix associated to the extended network , defined as proposed in this paper . specifically , when the msf is non - monotone , as in the case of the @xmath112-coupled rssler discussed in this paper , the width of the interval of the values of @xmath79 , for which the stability of the reference evolution can be guaranteed , depends simply on the eigenratio @xmath72 , as shown in fig .",

    "we observe that , while increasing the control gains may lead to a loss of pinning - controllability of the network , applying a larger number of controllers is always an effective strategy . on the other hand ,",
    "the requirement of pinning a large number of nodes can make the technique unfeasible in those networks where altering the dynamics of too many nodes can lead to a loss of functionality of the network itself , or is too costly and unpractical .",
