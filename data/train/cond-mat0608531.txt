    "in strongly correlated electron systems , the competition between kinetic energy and coulomb repulsion gives rise to a variety of intriguing phenomena.@xcite the most simple approach is the single - band hubbard model , with on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath5 and a kinetic part proportional to the inter - site hopping amplitude @xmath6 .",

    "filling one finds a mott - hubbard insulator with one localized electron per site , i.e. , the coulomb energy dominates .",
    "however , the low - energy physics is determined by the kinetic energy : virtual hopping of the electrons to neighboring sites is effectively described by exchange interactions with @xmath7 .",
    "these govern the spin degrees of freedom and , in a multi - orbital model , are also relevant for the orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite    the competition between coulomb energy and kinetic energy also governs the formation of bound states , e.g. , excitons . in simple band insulators , binding of an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band reduces the coulomb energy , while the kinetic energy increases . in mott - hubbard insulators ,",
    "the lowest optical `` interband '' excitation creates an empty site and a doubly occupied site , i.e. , a hole in the lhb and a particle in the uhb .",
    "a hubbard exciton can be regarded as a bound state of an empty site and a doubly occupied site , moving in a background of singly occupied sites .",
    "studies of excitons in correlated electron systems thus far have focused on one- ( 1d ) or two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems .",
    "remarkably , it has been found that exciton binding can be driven by either the coulomb energy or the kinetic energy .",
    "the former is found in the 1d extended hubbard model , which takes into account the coulomb interaction @xmath8 between nearest or next - nearest neighbor sites.@xcite since _ both _ the mott - hubbard gap and the attractive interaction for exciton binding result from coulomb interactions , one expects different physics compared to band insulators .",
    "in fact , excitons are only formed below the gap if @xmath8 exceeds a critical value.@xcite for smaller values of @xmath8 , an excitonic resonance is found in the continuum above the gap , strongly affecting the line shape of the optical conductivity @xmath9.@xcite an exciton below the gap has been observed in 1d ni - halogen chains,@xcite and this exciton contributes to the gigantic non - linear optical response observed in these compounds.@xcite    the kinetic energy is of prime importance for excitons in the 2d cuprates,@xcite which are of charge - transfer type .",
    "the dispersion of a spinless charge - transfer exciton is of order @xmath6 , _ larger _ than the single - particle dispersion , which is suppressed to @xmath10 by antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations .",
    "thus exciton formation reduces the _ kinetic _ energy , @xcite which bears resemblance to a possible mechanism for cooper pair formation in high-@xmath11 superconductors.@xcite experimentally , the exciton dispersion has been studied by electron - energy - loss spectroscopy@xcite and by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs).@xcite it has been claimed that the dispersion is indeed large,@xcite but recent high - resolution rixs data@xcite indicate that the exciton dispersion is suppressed by the coupling to phonons .    here",
