    "it is also possible to define a relative entropy with respect to some reference set of configurations of probability @xmath6 ( such as those at the critical point or zero temperature ) , @xmath7 if @xmath8 represents parameters characterizing the class of models under consideration , the relative entropy , @xmath9 , induces a metric for two `` close '' configurations @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 since @xmath13 and @xmath14 we find @xmath15 if we assume a gibbs - type distribution for the @xmath2 @xmath16 then the metric may be written as @xmath17 this metric is well known in statistics as the fisher - rao metric , and characterizes the `` closeness '' of probability distributions @xcite .",
    "for a one - parameter distribution the expectation value is the fisher information , @xmath18 , given by @xmath19 and is inversely related to the variance @xmath20 . in the multiparameter case this generalizes in the obvious manner to the covariance matrix .",
    "various authors @xcite have observed that the geometric invariants of the metric , in particular the curvature , @xmath21 , might be used to characterize the phase structure of statistical mechanical models .",
    "the first observation to note is that a non - interacting model , the ideal gas , has a flat geometry since @xmath22 .",
    "the suggestion was then that the curvature was a measure of the strength of interaction , an observation confirmed by a calculation in the case of a van der waals gas ( which is interacting ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature , @xmath3 the pressure , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are expressions appearing in the equation of state .",
    "this shows that the curvature diverges along the spinodal line where @xmath27 .",
    "these examples suggest that phase transitions are manifested as divergences in the scalar curvature associated with the fisher - rao metric , at least in two - parameter models .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether any of the standard scaling exponents associated with a transition can then be extracted from the behaviour of the curvature .",
    "this is best pursued by consideration of some specific examples .",
    "if we consider a spin model in field , the manifold of parameters , @xmath28 , is two - dimensional and parametrised by @xmath29 . in this case",

    "if we assume that hyperscaling holds , @xmath38 , this leads to @xmath39    to test the behaviour of @xmath0 , one requires models which are solvable in field in order to obtain analytic expressions , and these are rather thin on the ground . indeed , @xmath0 has been calculated for the mean - field and bethe - lattice ising models @xcite and the above scaling behaviour verified .",
    "it has also been calculated for the one - dimensional ising model @xcite where it takes the remarkably simple form , @xmath40 in this case @xmath0 is positive definite and diverges only at the zero - temperature , zero - field `` critical point '' of the model .",
    "the correlation length is given by @xmath41 so that @xmath42 near criticality , and ( [ equscal ] ) holds there with @xmath43 as expected being zero @xcite . ] .",
    "given this rather short list of examples , any further additions would be very worthwhile in order to see which features are generic and which are particular to the models concerned .",
    "we expand the list incrementally here , looking at the _ one_-dimensional potts model , the _ two_-dimensional ising model coupled to two - dimensional quantum gravity and the _ three_-dimensional spherical model , which shares the critical exponents of the just mentioned coupled ising model .",
    "we also discuss the application of similar ideas to critical behaviour in various families of black holes .",
    "the present paper is essentially an amalgam of results presented in @xcite , with some added discussion of related work in black hole physics .",

    "the model may be solved by transfer matrix methods @xcite , just as the 1d ising model . for general @xmath44",
    "the full transfer matrix @xmath50 may be written as @xmath51 diagonal elements , @xmath52 , and a @xmath53 factor @xmath54 : @xmath55 the partition function is @xmath56 and the eigenvalues of @xmath57 are @xmath58 , where @xmath59 \\ , ( y z ) ^ { - { 1 \\over q } } \\label{eigen}\\ ] ] and @xmath60 .",

    "in particular , the sign of the @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) limit of @xmath0 changes at @xmath79 , although the general morphology of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath68 remains the same for all @xmath80 as we shall see below .",

    "some years ago lee and yang @xcite addressed the question of how the singularities associated with field - driven phase transitions in ising - like spin models on lattices arose in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this was later extended by various authors to other models and to temperature - driven transitions @xcite .",
    "lee and yang observed that the zeroes of the partition function for a spin model in a complex external field on a finite lattice would give rise to singularities in the free energy . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "these complex zeroes move in to pinch the real axis , signalling the onset of a physical phase transition . typically , the loci of zeroes are lines in the complex field or temperature plane and when the endpoints of such lines occur at non - physical ( i.e.  complex ) external field values they can be considered as ordinary critical points with an associated edge critical exponent , usually dubbed the lee - yang edge exponent @xcite .",

    "it is clear that @xmath0 will also diverge as the locus of zeroes is approached for both ising and potts models if we allow ourselves the liberty of an analytic continuation of the field to complex @xmath96 values once @xmath0 has been calculated , since @xmath97 and @xmath98 are finite as @xmath99 .",
    "the presence of the square root means that the divergence is characterised by an exponent @xmath100 which is the lee - yang edge exponent for the one - dimensional potts ( and ising ) model @xcite .",
    "the status of these observations is a little unclear to us , since the calculation of @xmath0 has assumed a real metric geometry throughout and such an arbitrary continuation in the final expression might be rather dangerous .",
    "it is nonetheless interesting that the lee - yang edge transition is still visible as a divergence in @xmath0 .",
    "the solution of the ising model on an ensemble of @xmath101 ( @xmath102-regular ) or @xmath103 ( @xmath89-regular ) planar random graphs was first presented by boulatov and kazakov @xcite , who were motivated by string - theoretic considerations , since the continuum limit of the theory represents matter coupled to 2d quantum gravity .",

    "it was found that the critical exponents were given by @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , so the transition was _ third _ order with , intriguingly , the same exponents as the 3d spherical model on a regular lattice @xcite .",
    "if we carry out a perturbative expansion for the high - temperature solution , which is symmetric in @xmath96 and hence a series in even powers , we find @xmath124 where the coefficients in the series are most naturally expressed in terms of @xmath125 , as above .",
    "the expected scaling form of the various components of @xmath0 for a generic spin model in field is discussed at some length in @xcite , and we now recapitulate these results briefly for comparison with the specific results for the ising model on planar random graphs . the starting point is the scaling form of the free energy per spin near the critical point , @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the scaling dimensions for the energy and spin operators . for @xmath129 ,",

    "there would instead be a contribution from a regular term , which would give a constant at the critical point .",

    "critical behaviour has arisen in several contexts in the study of black holes , ranging from the hawking - page @xcite phase transition in hot anti - de - sitter space and the pioneering work by davies @xcite on the thermodynamics of kerr - newman black holes , to the idea that the extremal limit of various black hole families might be regarded as a bona - fide critical point @xcite .",
