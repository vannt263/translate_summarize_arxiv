    "the relation between the short distance regime of qcd and its low energy sector is a problem which can be addressed by lattice techniques .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter , characterizing the coupling at large energy , can be related to a hadronic quantity by a recursive finite  size technique , avoiding in such a way the multiple scale problem .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to the zero flavour approximation of qcd  @xcite and first results extending it to qcd with two massless flavours have been presented last year by our collaboration  @xcite . here",
    "we report about more recent results which allow for a better estimate of systematic effects on our determination of the @xmath3 parameter in the two flavour theory .",
    "this result is essential also in the computation of the running quark mass  @xcite .",
    "we consider the schrdinger functional ( sf ) , defined as the euclidean partition function of qcd on a cylinder of size @xmath4 @xmath5 e^{-s } \\;,\\ ] ] with periodic ( up to a phase ) boundary conditions in the spatial directions and dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath6 .",
    "the spatial links at @xmath6 are fixed to diagonal su(3 ) matrices specified in terms of @xmath7 and one angle @xmath8 while the quark fields are given by grassmann values @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , which are used as sources and then set to zero .",
    "we work with an o(@xmath13 ) improved wilson action and improved operators , employing the non  perturbative @xmath14  @xcite coefficient and one and two  loop values for the boundary coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the improvement coefficient @xmath17 is also set to its one  loop value .",
    "it enters our definition of quark mass @xmath18 via the pcac relation .",
    "the mass is required to be consistent with zero  @xcite .    for @xmath19 , the sf coupling @xmath20 is defined  @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 fixed by the condition @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath7 plays the role of a renormalization scale .",
    "the main quantity in the present computation is the step scaling function ( ssf ) @xmath24 which can be viewed as a non  perturbative integrated form of the @xmath25function .",
    "once @xmath26 has been computed in the continuum limit and for a large enough range of values , the equation @xmath27 can be recursively solved @xmath28 times ( for explicit equations see e.g.  @xcite ) starting from the hadronic scale @xmath29 with @xmath30 . in this way we obtain values for @xmath31 . for large @xmath28",
    "this coupling is perturbative and we compute the @xmath3 parameter in units of @xmath29 making use of the three ",
    "loop @xmath25 function in the sf scheme  @xcite @xmath32\\right\\}\\ \\label{lambdapert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] later we will have to relate @xmath29 to a physical scale , e.g. by determining @xmath33 .",
    "[ table:1 ]    our new simulations and results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "these allow for more reliable continuum limit extrapolations of the ssf .",
    "we extract the continuum limit values for the ssf using data for the two  loop improved observable @xmath34  @xcite from @xmath35 and @xmath0 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 is shown in figure  [ fig_scal ] for two different values of @xmath38 .",
    "for comparison we included in the plot the continuum results in the quenched case ( black squares ) for the same value of the couplings .    .",
    "black squares indicate the continuum limit extrapolation for @xmath39 . ]",
    "the function @xmath26 is obtained interpolating the continuum limit estimates by a sixth  order polynomial with the first three coefficients constrained by perturbation theory .",
    "starting from @xmath40 or @xmath41 we can then estimate the quantity @xmath42 as discussed above .",

    "the non  perturbative evolution of @xmath48 @xmath49 starting from @xmath50 is plotted in figure  [ run_fig ] .",
    "statistical and systematical errors ( difference between continuum limit and @xmath43 ) are too small to be visible in the plot .",
    "the figure shows that differences between monte carlo results and three  loop perturbation theory become appreciable for large values of the coupling , while for high energies the perturbative approximation very closely reproduces the non  perturbative results .     in the sf scheme.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ run_fig ]",
    "for the largest values of the coupling in our study ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) we observed a long tail towards negative values in the distribution of @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , measuring by a cooling procedure the pure gauge contribution to the action @xmath54 , and to the coupling @xmath55 , we observed occurrences of metastable states in our monte carlo histories .",
    "the action @xmath54 for these states is consistent with the value for a secondary solution of the field equations  @xcite , given our choice for the boundary fields .",
    "this solution appears to be a local minimum by numerical evidence .    in order to properly estimate the weight of these states we enhanced their occurrence through a modified sampling  @xcite , adding to the hmc effective action a term @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are fixed values , while @xmath59 is a dynamical variable .",
    "the expectation values in the original ensemble are then obtained by reweighting properly the observables .    defining a quantity @xmath60",
    "whose value is 1 for metastable states and 0 otherwise ( so that @xmath61 ) , for an observable @xmath62 one can write @xmath63 where @xmath64 . if the main contribution to @xmath65 comes from the @xmath66 sector",
    "then a precise estimate of @xmath65 just requires a precise estimate of @xmath67 , which can be obtained by an algorithm which samples only the @xmath66 sector , together with rough estimates of @xmath68 and @xmath69 which can be obtained by the modified sampling .    by a set of simulations on @xmath0 and @xmath70 using this approach we could estimate the effect of metastable states on @xmath20 to be nearly @xmath71 for @xmath72",
    "this result is independent , within errors , from @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , for this value of the coupling , we noticed a slightly better behavior for the phmc algorithm in comparison with hmc ( smaller values of @xmath57 needed in order to generate a certain number of transitions from / to a metastable state ) .    for @xmath74 ,",
    "the effect of metastable states is much larger , as expected , resulting in a @xmath75 to @xmath76 contribution .",
    "however their sampling is also enhanced in this case using both phmc or hmc already in the original ensemble .",
    "indeed we repeated the @xmath77 simulation for @xmath52 using ordinary phmc as in ref .  @xcite but disentangling the occurrence of metastable states .",
    "this turned out to be around @xmath78 and the result for @xmath20 was fully consistent with the number in ref .",
