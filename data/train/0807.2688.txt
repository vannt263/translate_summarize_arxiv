    "high-@xmath3 superconductors ( htsc ) have one or more cuo@xmath4 planes in a conducting block , which is separated by charge - reservoir blocks . in htsc with more than three cuo@xmath4 planes in a unit cell , there exist two inequivalent types of cuo@xmath4 planes ; pyramidally - coordinated - outer planes ( op ) and square - coordinated - inner planes ( ip ) . the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies found that the hole density in op is lager than that in ip  @xcite .",
    "an example of these is the five - layered hgba@xmath4ca@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , in which the optimally doped ops are superconducting ( sc ) with @xmath8 , while the three ips have an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) moment  @xcite .",
