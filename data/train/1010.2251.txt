    "understanding nonequilibrium phenomena in transport through quantum dots and single - molecule devices is of fundamental interest and is a major challenge in the field of nanoscience .",
    "much attention has been paid to the interplay of the dot - lead hybridization and on - dot interactions involving vibrational degrees of freedom or the local repulsions which lead to magnetic moments and to kondo physics . however , the effect of an ` excitonic ' interaction between the charge on the dot and the charge on the leads has been studied little , even though it clearly should be present on physical grounds . in this paper we address this physics in the context of a quantum dot connected to two one - dimensional leads .",
    "the model we consider is inspired by recent experimental investigations of the conductance of a molecule placed in the gap created by breaking a carbon nanotube,@xcite although theory and experiment are not yet at the point where a quantitative comparison can be made .",

    "dot side - hybridized to a luttinger - liquid lead.@xcite we found that this ` excitonic ' coupling has important consequences for electronic correlations and may enhance the tunneling of electrons in the regime of weak hybridization .",
    "the present paper extends our analysis to the case of a quantum dot placed between two leads such that it _",

    "this situation differs in several respects from that considered in our previous work .",
    "most fundamentally , intrinsically nonequilibrium behavior driven by a current flow across the dot is possible .",
    "further , because we deal with semi - infinite systems , boundary exponents appear instead of bulk exponents . finally , the presence of two leads means that tunneling into one lead is modified by orthogonality effects arising from the excitonic coupling to the other lead .",
