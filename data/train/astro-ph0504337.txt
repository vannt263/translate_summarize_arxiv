    "red supergiants ( rsgs ) are an important but poorly characterized phase in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "as discussed recently by massey ( 2003 ) and massey & olsen ( 2003 ) , stellar evolution models do not produce rsgs that are as cool or as luminous as those observed .",
    "such a discrepancy is not surprising , given the tremendous challenge rsgs present to evolutionary calculations .",
    "the rsg opacities are uncertain because of possible deficiencies in our knowledge of molecular opacities .",
    "the atmospheres of these stars are highly extended , but in general the models assume plane - parallel geometry .",
    "in addition , the velocities of the convective layers are nearly sonic , and even supersonic in the atmospheric layers , giving rise to shocks ( freytag et al .",
    "this invalidates the mixing - length assumptions , making the star s photosphere very asymmetric and its radius poorly defined , as demonstrated by recent high angular resolution observations of betelgeuse ( young et al .",
    "2000 ) .    while considering these challenges , we must , however , recognize that the  observed \" location of rsgs in the h - r diagram is also highly uncertain , as it requires a sound knowledge of the effective temperatures of these stars . for stars",
    "this cool ( roughly 3000 to 4000 k ) , the bolometric corrections ( bcs ) are quite significant ( -4 to -1 mags ) , and these bcs are a steep function of effective temperature .",
    "this makes an accurate effective temperature scale doubly necessary , as a 10% error in @xmath4 would lead to a factor of 2 error in bolometric luminosity computed from @xmath5 , according to the kurucz ( 1992 ) model atmospheres as described by massey & olsen ( 2003 ) . while interferometric data has provided a good fundamental calibration of red _ giants _ ( see , for example , dyck et al .",
    "1996 ) , there are not enough nearby red supergiants to employ this method in determining an effective temperature scale . instead",
    ", previous scales have relied upon using broad - band colors to assign temperatures based on the few red supergiants with measured diameters ( lee 1970 , following johnson 1964 , 1966 ) , or upon  observed \" bolometric corrections ( from ir measurements ) combined with the assumption of a blackbody distribution for the continuum ( see flower 1975 , 1977 ) .",
    "however , @xmath6 is highly sensitive to the surface gravity of the star due to the increased effects of line blanketing with lower surface gravities ; the effect is particularly pronounced at @xmath7 due to the multitude of weak metal lines in the region ; see discussion in massey ( 1998 ) . in point of fact , the true continuum at these temperatures ( that produced by continuous absorption ) is probably never seen , as noted by aller ( 1960 ) .",
    "white & wing ( 1978 ) attempt to get around this problem by a novel scheme involving an 8-color narrow band filter set , which was fit by a blackbody curve and iteratively corrected to determine uncontaminated continua .",
    "however , in all such continuum fits there is always some degeneracy between changes in the effective temperature and changes in the amount of reddening to be applied to the models ; this is particularly important for the rsgs , as they can be heavily reddened .",
    "an alternative approach would be to make use of the incredibly rich tio molecular bands which dominate the optical spectra of m - type stars .",
    "atmospheric models , however , have not always included an accurate opacity , especially for molecular transitions .",
    "the problem largely stems from the fact that any molecule found in a stellar atmosphere  even that of an m - type star  must be considered  high temperature \" , while most laboratory data have been obtained at much lower temperatures and do not include high - excitation transitions . the situation has decided improved in the past years , in large part due to the great efforts by a few groups to compute ab initio line lists ( e.g. , partridge & schwenke 1997 , harris et al .",
    "2003 ) , and it now seems quite satisfactory regarding oxygen - rich mixtures , such as tio ( see reviews by gustafsson & jorgensen 1994 and tsuji 1986 ) .    the new generation of marcs models ( gustafsson et al .  1975 ; plez et al .",
    "1992 ) now includes a much - improved treatment of molecular opacity ( see plez 2003 , gustafsson et al .",
    "2003 ) . using absolute spectrophotometry ( both continuum fluxes and the strengths of the g - band for k stars and the tio bands for m stars )",
    ", these models can now be used to make a far more robust determination of @xmath4 and the reddening . since",
    "band strengths are used to determine the spectral type of rsgs , these new models could serve as a definitive connection between spectral type and @xmath4 .    here",
    "we present spectrophotometry of 74 galactic k- and m - type supergiants ( sec .",
    "[ sec - obs ] ) , and use fits of the marcs models to determine effective temperatures ( sec .  [ sec - analysis ] ) .",
    "we begin the analysis by reclassifying the stars ( sec .",
    "[ sec - types ] ) , and then construct a new @xmath4 scale for galactic rsgs ( sec .",
    "[ sec - teff ] ) .",
    "most of these stars are members of associations and clusters with known distances , allowing us to also place the stars on the h - r diagram for comparison with the latest generation of stellar evolutionary models , which include the effects of stellar rotation ( sec .",
    "[ sec - evolution ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec - k ] , we compare the physical parameters of these stars derived in the optical to those found from k - band photometry in order to test the self - consistency of the marcs models .    in future work , we will extend this study to the lower metallicity magellanic clouds , where the distribution of spectral subtypes is considerably earlier than in the milky way ( elias et al .",
    "1985 ; massey & olsen 2003 ) .",
    "the lower abundance of tio may by itself lead to a lower @xmath4 for stars of the same spectral subtype , as suggested by massey & olsen ( 2003 ) .",
    "our stars are listed in table  [ tab : stars ] .",
    "the sample was selected in order to cover the full range of spectral subtypes from early k through the latest m supergiants .",
    "the sample was originally chosen to contain only stars with probable membership in ob associations and clusters with known distances ( humphreys 1978 , garmany & stencel 1992 ) , but we supplemented this list with spectral standards from the list of morgan & keenan ( 1973 ) in order to help refine the spectral classification .",
    "we indicate both cluster membership and/or use as a spectral standard in the table .",
    "the photometry comes from a variety of sources , as indicated ; one should keep in mind that most ( if not all ) of these stars are variable at the level of several tenths or more in @xmath5 .",
    "we have included the @xmath3 colors as well , where the @xmath8 comes from josselin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and references therein .",
    "distances of ob associations are notoriously uncertain , as most are far too distant for reliable trigonometric parallaxes ; instead , spectral parallaxes need to be used , often resulting in a large dispersion due to the large scatter in @xmath9 for a given spectral subtype ( see conti 1988 ) . in table",
    "[ tab : dists ] we give the distances from several sources , when possible , for each ob association or cluster in our sample ; in general , the agreement is within a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "we also include in table  [ tab : dists ] the  average \" reddenings determined from the values for _ early_-type members listed by humphreys ( 1978 ) for the ob associations .",
    "for the clusters , we list the average reddening values given by mermilliod & paunzen ( 2003 ) .",
    "we note that in general membership in an ob association is never perfectly well established , and therefore there is an additional uncertainty connected with the distance of any particular star .",
    "the spectrophotometry data were obtained during three observing runs : two with the kpno 2.1-meter telescope and goldcam spectrograph ( 17 - 24 march 2004 and 28 may - 1 june 2004 ) , and one with the ctio 1.5-meter telescope and cassegrain ccd spectrometer ( 7 - 12 march 2004 ) .",
    "similar resolutions and wavelength coverage were obtained in both hemispheres .",
    "detailed information on the observing parameters is given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the kitt peak observations were taken under sporadically cloudy conditions in march , while all of the nights in may / june were photometric . before observing each object ,",
    "the spectrograph was manually rotated so that the slit was aligned with the parallactic angle .",
    "we aimed for a s / n of 50 per spectral resolution element ( 4 pixels ) at the bluest end of the spectrum , with care being taken not to saturate the detector at the reddest end .",
    "for the brightest stars ( @xmath10 ) , we employed a 5.0  mag or 7.5  mag neutral density filter .",
    "observations of the flat - field lamps were obtained both with and without these filters in order to correct for the wavelength dependence of the transmission of these  neutral \" filters . throughout each night",
    "we also observed a set of spectrophotometric standards .",
    "the seeing for these observations was 1.2  to 3  , with a typical value of 2  .",
    "exposures of both dome flats and projector flats were obtained at the beginning of each night ; for the red nights , we also obtained projector flats throughout the night to monitor any shifting of the fringe pattern that affects the ccd at longer wavelengths .",
    "wavelength calibration exposures of a he - ne - ar lamp were obtained at the beginning and end of each night .    at ctio ,",
    "it was not practical to always observe at the parallactic angle ; instead , each star was observed with a single exposure through a very wide slit ( for good relative fluxes ) , followed by a series of shorter exposures obtained through a narrow slit ( for good resolution ) .",
    "projector flats were obtained for all wavelength regions through both the wide and narrow slits .",
    "the exposures were typically obtained in conjunction with a wavelength calibration exposure , although in practice we found there was little flexure .",
    "observations of spectrophotometric standards were obtained throughout the night .",
    "we reduced the data using iraf packages ccdred , kpnoslit and ctioslit .",
    "we used dome flats to flatten the blue kitt peak data , and the projector lamps to flatten the red kitt peak data .",
    "we found that the only shift in the fringe pattern in the red occurred during the thirty minutes following a refill of the dewar with liquid nitrogen .",
    "after that the fringe pattern was stable , so we simply combined these projector flats .",
    "the spectra were all extracted using an optimal - extraction algorithm . when reducing the ctio data the narrow slit width observations were combined and divided into the wide slit observations .",
    "the resulting division was fit with a low - order function and used to correct the fluxes of the narrow - slit observations .",
    "in a few cases the wide - slit observations included the presence of an additional star in the extraction aperture ; these stars were eliminated from further consideration , and do not appear in table  [ tab : stars ] .",
    "the observations of spectrophotometric standards were used to create sensitivity functions ; typically a grey - shift was applied to each night s data , and the resulting scatter was 0.02  mag .",
    "in addition , the different wavelength regions were grey - shifted to agree in the regions of overlap .    when we began our analysis we found significant discrepancies between the reddened model atmospheres and the observed spectra in the near - uv region ( @xmath114000  for the reddest stars .",
    "careful investigations suggest that , despite the excellent agreement of the spectrophotometric standards , there could be contamination by a grating ghost in the near - uv , in which a small fraction of the red light contaminates the data .",
    "the expected flux ratio @xmath12 is roughly 10,000 for the most reddened m supergiants , a regime seldom encountered in astronomical spectrophotometry .",
    "we do not know if this contamination is a small fraction of the near - uv light , or if it dominates , and we have therefore restricted our study to the data longwards 4100 , where our tests show that the ghosting effect is negligible .",
    "we reclassified each of our stars by visually comparing each spectrum to the spectral standards . in order to avoid questions of normalizing these rich and complicated spectra ( with uncertain continuum levels ) ,",
    "we did this comparison in terms of log flux . given that many of these stars can be variable in spectral type , we were unsurprised to find that we needed to reclassify a few of the spectral standards for consistency .",
    "for the late - k and all m type stars , the classification was based upon the depths of the tio bands , which are increasingly strong with later spectral type .",
    "the reclassification of the early and mid k supergiants was based primarily on the strengths of the g - band plus the strength of ca  i @xmath0 .",
    "these features all get weaker with later spectral types ( jaschek & jaschek 1987 ) , a temperature effect which we confirmed with the marcs models .",
    "we list our revised spectral types in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "we compared the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each star to a series of marcs stellar atmosphere models .",
    "the models used in our comparisons ranged from 3000  k to 4300  k in increments of 100  k , with @xmath13 from + 1.0 to -1.0 in increments of 0.5  dex . the choice of surface gravity was derived iteratively ; we began by adopting the @xmath14 models for all of the fits , as this surface gravity was generally what was expected with the old effective temperature scale and the resulting placement in the hrd .",
    "however , our new temperatures were a bit warmer than that predicted by the old scale , so we re - evaluated all of the fits using @xmath15 , as this was more consistent with the revised locations in the hrd .",
    "the effective temperatures remained unchanged with the use of these higher surface gravities ( except for the occasional star ) , but the values of @xmath16 increased slightly .",
    "finally , we used the revised temperature scale and bolometric luminosities with the evolutionary tracks ( sec .",
    "[ sec - evolution ] ) to compute @xmath13 star - by - star for the rsgs with distances .",
    "this confirmed that our choice of the @xmath15 models was appropriate for most of the stars .",
    "we refit the stars using the appropriate @xmath13 if the distance was known ; otherwise , we adopted @xmath15 . in practice the choice of @xmath13 affected the derived values of @xmath16 by @xmath17  mag , and had no effect on the derived effective temperatures .    in making the fits , we reddened each model using a cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) reddening law with the standard ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath18 is typically taken to be @xmath19 for rsgs ( lee 1970 ) , due to the increase of the effective wavelength of broad - band filters with redder stars ; see mccall ( 2004 ) for a recent discussion .",
    "our own calculations from the models suggest that @xmath20 would be more appropriate for @xmath21 photometry of rsgs .",
    "note , however , that in the absence of a peculiar reddening law , @xmath18 is an appropriate choice for our study , since our analysis is not based upon broad - band filter photometry , but rather upon moderate - resolution ( 5 ) seds ; i.e. , neither the @xmath7 nor @xmath5 filters were involved in our extinction determinations . in order to prevent confusion",
    ", we use the equivalent a@xmath22 values rather than @xmath16 , as our a@xmath22 values will be directly comparable to those of others , while our @xmath16 values would be larger than those determined from broad - band photometry for rsgs . ] . our initial guess for @xmath16",
    "was based upon the average value for the cluster , i.e. , @xmath23 from table  [ tab : dists ] .",
    "the temperature was determined primarily from the strengths of the tio bands ( m supergiants ) and the g - band ( early - to - mid k supergiants ) , with @xmath16 then adjusted to produce the best fit to the continuum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots ] we show a sample of spectra and fits , covering a range of spectral types ; the complete set is available in the electronic edition of the journal .",
    "the fitting was all done in log units of flux in order to facilitate comparisons of line intensities without the uncertain process of normalization , as mentioned previously .",
    "as described in the previous section , our initial modeling revealed a significant discrepancy between the models and the data in the near - uv region ( 3500 - 4000 ) for the reddest stars , which we first attributed to a peculiar reddening law , caused , we argued , by circumstellar dust .",
    "however , since we can not exclude the possibility that the near - uv data are affected by an instrumental problem , we will revisit this issue at a later time when we have better data in the near - uv .    otherwise , the agreement between the seds of the reddened models and the data is extremely good , both in terms of the continua and molecular band depths .",
    "the only significant problem we encountered was for the early - to - mid k stars , where we expected to use both the ca  i @xmath0 line as well as the g - band in modeling the stars , as these lines are among the primary classification lines for the early k s .",
    "however , we found that these ca  i line was stronger in the marcs models synthetic spectra than in our stars , usually by a factor of 3 or so .",
    "the ca  i line show the same qualitative behavior with effective temperature as expected ( see above discussion ) , but the absolute line strengths in the models were too strong .",
    "since ca has a very low ionization potential ( 6.11 ev ) , most of the ca is in the form of ca ii : @xmath2499% in the model at 4000  k and 98% in the model at 3600  k ( at an optical depth of 0.01 for the continuum ) .",
    "thus , a small over - ionization will strongly impact the line strength , due to either the effects of non - lte or a slight error in the model s temperature structure .",
    "the occurrence of cool or hot spots on the stellar surface could also lead to regions where the ionization equilibrium is strongly affected .",
    "in addition to the problem with the ca  i line , the models also produce ca  ii h and k lines that are significantly stronger than those observed , even in those stars for which the fluxes of the dereddened stars and the stars were in good agreement .",
    "this is not hard to understand , as rsgs are expected to have chromospheric activity , and this is not accounted for in the models .",
    "the presence of a chromosphere would lead to emission in the h and k lines , resulting in weaker observed lines than would be the case if the lines were purely photospheric in origin .",
    "this explanation could be further investigated by means of high - dispersion spectroscopy .",
    "we relied instead upon the g - band for the fitting of the early and mid - ks .",
    "we substantiated that we obtained similar temperatures using the g - band and the tio bands for the late ks .",
    "the resulting temperature fits for the early and mid ks are therefore less certain , probably @xmath25 k.    we list the effective temperatures in table  [ tab : results ] . in general",
    ", we found that the data could be matched very well by the models , _ both _ in line strength and in continuum shape , and we expect that the effective temperatures of the m supergiants have been obtained to a precision of 50  k. the a@xmath22 values are determined to a precision of about 0.15  mag .",
    "we note with interest that the derived a@xmath22 values of about one - third our sample are significantly higher than the average found from the ob stars in the same associations and clusters using the data from humphreys ( 1978 ) ; indeed , the same conclusion could have been drawn from the older data given in that paper .",
    "a possible interpretation is that this extra extinction is due to circumstellar dust .",
    "we include the @xmath26a@xmath22 values in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "we will revisit this issue in a subsequent paper , once our analysis of the magellanic cloud data ( where the foreground reddening is low , and relatively uniform ) is complete .",
    "our new effective temperature scale is given in table  [ tab : newt ] , where we include the number of stars and standard deviation of the mean ( @xmath27 ) at each spectral type .",
    "we compare this scale to that of humphreys & mcelroy ( 1984 ) and massey & olsen ( 2003 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : tscale ] . both of the latter are  averages \" from the literature .",
    "we see that the new scale agrees well for the k supergiants , but is progressively warmer than past scales for later spectral types , with the differences amounting to 400  k by the latest m supergiants ( m5  i ) .",
    "the overall progression of the temperature with later spectral type is more gradual than in past studies .",
    "we include in table  [ tab : newt ] the bolometric corrections to the v - band corresponding to the new effective temperature scale ; these values are the linear interpolations of the bcs from the marcs models given below .",
    "the values are for @xmath15 , but there is little change with surface gravity ( @xmath28  mag over 0.5  dex in @xmath13 for @xmath29 ) . note that we have referenced the bcs to the system advocated by bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , i.e. , that the sun has a bc of -0.07  mag .",

    "the @xmath52 correction suggests that if anything the @xmath30 values should be intermediate between what we derive above from @xmath5 and from @xmath8 using our values for the extinction , and that perhaps our extinction values for these two stars are too low , rather than too high . a comparison between the lumionsities derived from @xmath8 and @xmath57 and those derived from @xmath5 and the extinctions derived from our model fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k2]f ; this is very similar to what we found in fig .",

    "we summarize the conclusions from these comparisons as follows .",
    "first , the marcs models yield consistent results",
    "( to within 100  k ) both from the molecular band strengths and from the @xmath3 colors .",
    "thus if one s goal is simply to derive bolometric luminosities , @xmath5 and @xmath8 band data will suffice for most purposes , if one has an estimate of the reddenings .",
    "however , for accurate placement in the h - r diagram ( requiring @xmath4 ) then there is as yet no substitute for spectroscopy and the use of molecular bands .",
    "it is possible that other colors , such as @xmath58 , might prove more effective in determining the effective temperatures than @xmath3 , given the shorter baseline and therefore lower sensitivity to reddening , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "we will explore this further when we consider the magellanic cloud sample , as these stars have simultaneous @xmath5 and @xmath60 measures , and the reddenings are low and uniform ( massey et al .",
    "we have determined a new effective temperature scale for galactic rsgs by fitting moderate resolution ( 4 - 6 ) spectrophotometry with the new marcs stellar atmosphere models .",
    "our effective temperature scale is significantly warmer than previous scales , particularly for the later m supergiants , where the differences amount to 400 k. however , our new results give excellent agreement with the evolutionary tracks of meynet & maeder ( 2003 ) , resolving the issue posed by massey ( 2003 ) that the evolutionary models do not produce rsgs as cool and as luminous as  observed \" .",
    "our fitting showed excellent agreement between the models and data for the majority of the stars .",
    "the ca  i @xmath0 and ca  ii h and k atomic lines appear to be too strong in the models , but the molecular transitions agree well at this dispersion .",
    "when we compare the physical properties derived from the model fits to our optical spectrophotometry with those found from the models using only the dereddened @xmath3 colors , we find good agreement , providing an exacting demonstration of the self - consistency of the marcs models .",
    "extension of these studies to the magellanic clouds is underway , which should help us understand the effect that metallicity has on the effective temperature scale of rsgs .",
    "in addition , the fact that the reddenings are small and uniform and the distances are known ( van den bergh 2000 ) will allow further investigation of colors as probes of the physical properties of these interesting massive stars .",

    "<S> we use moderate - resolution optical spectrophometry and the new marcs stellar atmosphere models to determine the effective temperatures of 74 galactic red supergiants ( rsgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stars are mostly members of ob associations or clusters with known distances , allowing a critical comparison with modern stellar evolutionary tracks . </S>",
    "<S> we find we can achieve excellent matches between the observations and the reddened model fluxes and molecular transitions , although the atomic lines ca  i @xmath0 and ca  ii h and k are found to be unrealistically strong in the models . </S>",
    "<S> our new effective temperature scale is significantly warmer than those in the literature , with the differences amounting to 400  k for the latest - type m supergiants ( i.e. , m5  i ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the newly derived temperatures and bolometric corrections give much better agreement with stellar evolutionary tracks . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement provides a completely independent verification of our new temperature scale . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of effective temperature and bolometric luminosities allows us to calculate stellar radii ; the coolest and most luminous stars ( kw sgr , case 75 , ky cyg , hd 206936=@xmath1 cep ) have radii of roughly 1500@xmath2 ( 7 au ) , in excellent accordance with the largest stellar radii predicted from current evolutionary theory , although smaller than that found by others for the binary vv cep and for the peculiar star vy cma . </S>",
    "<S> we find that similar results are obtained for the effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities using only the de - reddened @xmath3 colors , providing a powerful demonstration of the self - consistency of the marcs models . </S>"
