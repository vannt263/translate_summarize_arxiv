    "in continuum perturbation theory dimensional regularization  @xcite is for many phenomenological applications the most common regulator for divergent loop - integrals .",
    "physical observables computed to higher orders are often conveniently renormalized in the minimal subtraction ( @xmath1 ) scheme  @xcite ; thus the renormalization constants are well known to high order in perturbation theory .",
    "however , the @xmath1 scheme is fixed to dimensional regularization and is usually not directly applicable in lattice calculations . in the context of lattice simulations in combination with non - perturbative renormalization , regularization - invariant momentum subtraction(mom )",
    "schemes are used  @xcite . in regularization - invariant(ri ) schemes the renormalization constants are often fixed by demanding that the renormalized quantity is equal to its lowest order value for a special momentum configuration(subtraction point ) . in order to convert results computed in a @xmath2 scheme to the @xmath1 scheme matching factors are needed which translate an observable renormalized in the given @xmath2 scheme into the @xmath1 scheme .",
    "these matching factors can be computed perturbatively . for example , the computation of the mass conversion factor @xmath3 , which turns a quark mass renormalized in the @xmath2 scheme into the @xmath1 scheme , or the conversion factor @xmath4 , which performs the corresponding conversion of the quark fields , are both known up to three - loop order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics(qcd )  @xcite . in the @xmath5 scheme which is also used in lattice simulations these matching factors",
    "are also known to the same order  @xcite .",
    "apart from quark masses , also the strong coupling constant @xmath6 has been considered in momentum subtraction schemes  @xcite .",
    "taking into account vertex diagrams , one has a larger choice of defining the subtraction point at which the renormalization constants are fixed through different momentum configurations .",
    "two examples are the exceptional(or asymmetric ) subtraction point with the external minkowskian momenta @xmath7 , @xmath8 or the non - exceptional(or symmetric ) momentum configuration with @xmath9 .",

    "@xcite the renormalization of quark bilinear operators for a symmetric momentum subtraction point has been studied in the @xmath0 scheme for the vector , axial - vector , scalar , pseudo - scalar and tensor operators , where the s in smom stands for symmetric .",

    "light up- , down- and strange - quark masses were determined in ref .",
    "@xcite through lattice simulations in the @xmath2 scheme and subsequently converted to the @xmath1 scheme .",
    "however , the perturbative expansion of the matching factor @xmath3 in qcd shows poor convergence and leads currently to a significant contribution to the error on these quark masses . the uncertainty from the renormalization procedure of the quark masses in ref .",
    "@xcite amounts to around 60% of the total error . in order to renormalize",
    "the quark masses in the lattice simulation , the renormalization constants need to be determined in a lattice calculation  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a symmetric subtraction point involves non - exceptional momenta which imply a lattice simulation with suppressed contamination from infrared effects , whereas the asymmetric subtraction point is less suited , since effects of chiral symmetry breaking vanish only slowly for large external momenta as a result of weinberg s theorem  @xcite .",
    "this proceedings contribution is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : genandnot ] we introduced the used conventions and notations and discuss generalities . in section  [ sec : results ] we summarize the results for the mass renormalization with a symmetric subtraction point , addressing the matching factors and the two - loop anomalous dimensions .",
