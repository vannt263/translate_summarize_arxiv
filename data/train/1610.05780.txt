    "the phases of matter of many physical systems can be labeled ( or classified ) by the symmetries of their local order parameters . in this picture",
    "the physical system has a global symmetry and the order parameter is a local observable that transforms under some irreducible representation of this symmetry.@xcite in the ordered phase the order parameter has a non - vanishing expectation and the global symmetry is broken spontaneously .    however , there are systems without any broken symmetries which can be regarded as condensates of seemingly non - local operators .",
    "this concept originates in the pioneering work of leo kadanoff ( with his then student horacio ceva ) of 1971 in which the concept of disorder operator was first introduced : an operator that has a vanishing expectation value in the broken symmetry phase of the 2d ising model but which instead has a non - vanishing expectation value in the disordered phase .",
    "such disorder operators have since been found in diverse systems including gauge theories and topological phases of quantum antiferromagnets . in this paper",
    "i review the kadanoff - ceva construction and several of its notable extensions that it had in diverse systems since 1971 , and discuss their role in our understanding of phases of matter .",
    "the prototype of this picture is the two - dimensional ising model of a ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy . in the ferromagnetic ising model at each site @xmath0 of the square lattice",
    "there is a magnetic moment that can take two possible values , @xmath1 , corresponding to the up and down spin states .",
    "the energy of a configuration of spins @xmath2 $ ] is @xmath3=- j \\sum_{\\langle { \\bm r } , { \\bm r}'\\rangle } \\sigma(\\bm r ) \\sigma({\\bm r } ' ) \\label{eq : ising}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over nearest - neighboring sites of the lattice , denoted by @xmath4 . in dimensions",
    "@xmath5 , the ising model has a stable ordered phase at temperatures below critical temperature , the onsager temperature @xmath6 , and a disordered phase for @xmath7 . in the ordered phase that order parameter has a uniform non - vanishing expectation value @xmath8 , which vanishes in the disordered phase , @xmath9 .      in 1971",
    "kadanoff and ceva@xcite introduced the concept of _ disorder variables _ ( or _ disorder operators _ ) in the context two - dimensional ising model , i.e. operators that acquire an expectation value in the disordered phase of a classical spin system .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote two sites of the dual lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder - operators]a and b ) .",
    "kadanoff and ceva proposed to consider a modified 2d ferromagnetic ising model with a defect that creates a fractional domain wall along a path @xmath12 of the dual lattice .",
    "this to introduce this defect is the same as to changing the coupling constant @xmath13 to have an antiferromagnetic ( negative ) sign along a seam of bonds pierced by the path @xmath12 ( denoted by the set of bold links in fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder - operators]a ) .",
    "the correlation function of the two disorder operators is defined to be @xmath14}{z}\\equiv",
    "\\exp(-\\delta f[\\gamma]/t ) \\label{eq : mumu}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is the partition function of the 2d ferromagnetic ising model , @xmath16 $ ] is the partition function with the fractional domain wall , and @xmath17 $ ] is the excess free energy caused by the defect .",
    "deep in the ferromagnetic phase the excess free energy originates primarily from spin degrees of freedom with a correlation length of the fractional domain wall . as a result the excess free energy grows linearly with the separation between the disorder operators , @xmath17=\\kappa |{\\tilde { \\bm r}}-{\\tilde { \\bm r}'}|$ ] . in the thermodynamic limit , and for large separations",
    ", @xmath18 is the same as the line tension of a 2d domain wall @xcite .",
    "hence , in the ordered phase the correlation function of the disorder variables vanishes exponentially fast at long distances . on the other hand , in the disordered phase where the symmetry is unbroken",
    ", the effects of the defect can only be appreciable at a distance of the order of the correlation length of the endpoints of the path @xmath12 .",
    "hence , in the disordered phase the correlator of disorder operators approaches a _",
    "finite _ limit at asymptotically long separations , @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the linear size of the system ) : in the disorder phase the disorder operator has an expectation value . in this sense",
    ", the disordered phase can be regarded as condensate of defects .",
    "to summarize , the correlator for large separations has the asymptotic behavior @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the onsager critical temperature .",
    "[ fig : disorder - operators ]    the configuration of disorder operators is more systematically defined using the language of gauge theory @xcite by introducing a set of ising variables @xmath24 $ ] on the links of the lattice , i.e. a set of background ising gauge fields @xcite . in this language , the ising spins are regarded as `` matter fields '' and the variables @xmath25 $ ] are ( background ) ising gauge fields . the partition function with the defect",
    "@xmath16 $ ] now is @xmath26=\\sum_{[\\sigma ] } \\exp\\big[\\frac{j}{t } \\sum_{\\langle { \\bm r } , { \\bm r}'\\rangle } \\sigma(\\bm r ) \\tau({\\bm r},{\\bm r } ' ) \\sigma({\\bm r}')\\big ] \\label{eq : z_gamma}\\ ] ] this partition function reproduces that of eq . for the configuration of ising gauge fields @xmath27 for the bonds pierced by the path @xmath12 and @xmath28 for all other bonds",
    "it is then simple to see that the partition function of eq .",
    "is unchanged under the local gauge transformation , @xmath29 and @xmath30 on all bonds @xmath31 that share the same site @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , it is also easy to see that the wilson loop operator @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a closed path of links of the lattice , is gauge - invariant , i.e. unchanged under gauge transformations .",
    "the wilson loop operator takes the value @xmath35 on _ any _ closed loop @xmath34 that contains the location of just one ( but not both ) of the disorder operators in its interior , and the value @xmath36 for all other loops .",
    "in particular , @xmath35 for the elementary loop ( the _ plaquette _ ) that contains one of the the disorder operators , since in these plaquettes there is an odd number ( one ) of links on which the variable @xmath37 .    by looking at the energies of spin configurations of these plaquettes",
    "one can see that the ground state energy for these plaquettes is always larger than @xmath38 since there is always one unsatisfied bond . for this reason",
    "such plaquettes are said to be _ frustrated _ @xcite .",
    "the concept of geometric frustration played an important role in the physics of spin glasses and in quantum antiferromagnets is at the root of the concept of a quantum spin liquids ( for a recent review on frustration and quantum spin liquids see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    from these observations",
    "it follows that the correlator of eq .",
    "is actually _ path - independent _ and depends only on the location of the disorder operators .",
    "for instance , the correlators defined by the paths @xmath12 and @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder - operators ] are exactly equal to each other .",
    "this also means that , in spite of their apparently non - local definition as a fractional domain wall , the disorder operators are actually local observables .",
    "in addition to the @xmath40 symmetry under global spin flips the 2d ising model has another , mire subtle , global symmetry : self - duality @xcite .",
    "this si a mapping between the low temperature expansion , which is an expansion of the 2d ising partition function in terms of loops representing the possible configurations of ( closed ) domain walls , to the high temperature expansion , which is an expansion of the partition function also in terms of loops representing the extent of spin correlation at high temperatures .",
    "kramers and wannier showed that these two expansions can be mapped into each other if the coupling constant @xmath41 is related to @xmath42 , the coupling constant in the dual model , are related by @xmath43 duality is thus a mapping of the degrees of freedom on the direct lattice at temperature @xmath44 to the ising model on the dual lattice at the dual temperature . under the assumption of a unique phase transition ,",
    "this relation famously allowed kramers and wannier to find the critical temperature of the 2d ising ferromagnet on a square lattice at the value obtained ( later ) by onsager .",
    "kadanoff and ceva realized that duality is actually a local geometric relation .",
    "using this fact they showed that under duality the spin - spin correlation function of the ising model with coupling constant @xmath45 is equal to the correlation function of disorder operators in the model at dual coupling @xmath42 , @xmath46 from which the asymptotic behavior of the correlator of disorder operators follows , consistent with what is expected from eq ..     ( the bold black dot ) and a disorder operator @xmath47 ( the cross at the adjoining dual site ) .",
    "the disorder operator is equivalent to the insertion of an array of antiferromagnetic bonds on the links pierced by the path @xmath12 on the dual lattice.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig : onsager_fermion ]      kadanoff and ceva then looked at a composite operator made of the product of a spin operator @xmath48 at lattice site @xmath32 and a disorder operator at an adjacent dual site @xmath10 , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : onsager_fermion ] .",
    "they denoted this operator by @xmath49 .",
    "there is an ambiguity in assigning spin to disorder operators since one can define two different operators at the dual sites @xmath50 adjacent to the site @xmath32 , and it is the manifestation of the spinor character of the fermion .",
    "furthermore , they also proceeded to consider the situation in which one of these composite operators where to be dragged around the other on a closed path of the lattice . at the end of this process the string of flipped bonds will necessarily enclose the spin operator of the other composite object .",
    "a closed loop of flipped bonds can be eliminated by a suitable gauge transformation in its interior , thus restoring the string to its original configuration .",
    "however , the gauge transformation requires to flip the spin enclosed inside the loop leading to a change of the _ sign _ of the correlator of the composite objects . in other words ,",
    "the composite operator @xmath51 , @xmath52 these operators behave as _ fermions _ which kadanoff and ceva identified as with the fermion ( spinor ) operator of the onsager solution of the 2d ising model @xcite .",
    "kadanoff and ceva then used these results to compute the operator algebra of the non - trivial fixed point of the 2d ising model , which was the central aim of that work .",
    "they showed that the operator algebra of the 2d ising fixed point consisted of the fermion operator @xmath53 ( with scaling dimension @xmath54 ) , the energy density operator @xmath55 ( the relevant thermal operator of the 2d ising critical point with scaling dimension 1 ) , and the order parameter @xmath56 ( with scaling dimension 1/8 ) . by kramers - wannier duality",
    ", the disorder operator @xmath47 has the same scaling dimension as the order parameter field @xmath56 .",
    "they also introduced the stress tensor operator @xmath44 ( an exactly marginal operator which they showed has scaling dimension 2 ) .",
    "more than ten years later , belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov @xcite and friedan , qiu and shenker @xcite showed that the operator algebra of the 2d ising model is the simplest example of a non - trivial conformal field theory ( cft ) and used this concept to classify a large class of 2d critical points .",
    "in this theory the stress - tensor plays a key role as the generator of the virasoro algebra of the cft .",
    "the equilibrium statistical mechanics of the 2d ising model is related to the physics of one - dimensional quantum spin systems through the formalism of the transfer matrix @xcite . here",
    ", the 2d classical ising model is viewed as the ( discrete ) path - integral representation of the quantum ising chain , the ising model in a transverse magnetic field @xcite , whose hamiltonian is @xmath57 which commutes with the full transfer matrix of the 2d ising model . here",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are the two @xmath60 real pauli matrices and act on the two - dimensional hilbert space of the spin states at each site @xmath61 of the chain .",
    "this hamiltonian is solvable by a jordan - wigner transformation to ( in this case , majorana ) fermion operators @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian has the global @xmath40 symmetry of flipping all spins simultaneously of the ising model .",

    "@xmath70 is the ground state of the hamiltonian of eq . at coupling",
    "constant @xmath71.the phase with unbroken @xmath40 symmetry corresponds to the high temperature phase of the 2d classical model and the broken symmetry phase to the low temperature phase of the 2d classical model .",
    "the critical coupling @xmath72 corresponds to the onsager critical temperature . a quantum version of the duality transformation @xcite , under which the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "maps onto itself ( i.e. it is self - dual ) upon the replacement @xmath73 , shows that @xmath74 , the value of exact solution @xcite .    the disorder operator in 1d quantum system is the _ kink _ ( or _ domain wall _ ) creation operator @xmath75 @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the site of the dual of the 1d lattice , the midpoints between the sites of the chain .",
    "in the unbroken symmetry phase , @xmath65 , the disorder operator has an expectation value , @xmath78 .",
    "hence , in the unbroken phase there is a condensate of state of kinks ( or domain walls ) . in the broken symmetry state",
    "the disorder operator has zero expectation value since it flips the spins from the boundary to the @xmath61th site , and creates a state which us incompatible ( orthogonal ) with the states of a periodic chain .",
    "as it is well known , the 1d quantum ising model is solved by means of the jordan - wigner transformation which maps a spin chain to a system of fermions @xcite .",
    "thus , we define the operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 these operators are hermitian , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and obey the anticommutation rules , @xmath84 hence , the operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 are a set of majorana ( self - adjoint ) fermion operators . in this language , the @xmath40 symmetry operator @xmath85 , defined in eq . , becomes @xmath86 the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "has a quadratic form expressed in terms of majorana fermion operators @xmath87 which , of course , is the reason for the solvability ( integrability ) of the 2d classical ising model and its 1d quantum cousin .",
    "thus , the majorana fermions operators of eq . obey ( heisenberg ) linear equations of motion @xmath88    near the ( quantum ) critical point , @xmath74 , we can take the continuum limit and replace the difference equations of eq . by differential equations ,",
    "@xmath89 this is just the dirac equation in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions of the majorana spinor @xmath90 with mass @xmath91 ( with lattice spacing @xmath92 ) @xmath93 holding @xmath91 fixed .",
    "this is the scaling variable tuning to the critical point .",
    "therefore , the universality class of the critical point of the 2d classical ising model ( or the quantum critical point of the quantum ising chain ) is represented by a theory of free relativistic majorana fermions @xcite . at the fixed point this is a cft with conformal central charge @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq . has been the focus of much recent interest , motivated by models of p - wave superconducting wires . in this context",
    "it is often referred to as the kitaev chain @xcite . to make this connection clear , it is useful to assign the set of @xmath95 majorana fermion operators , that we denoted by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , to a lattice of @xmath95 sites , labeled by @xmath96 .",
    "this new chain can be viewed as the original @xmath97 sites of the chain and the @xmath97 sites the dual chain .",
    "we now define @xmath98 in this notation the hamiltonian becomes @xmath99 kitaev noted that , if the chain obeys open boundary conditions , in the limit @xmath100 , a majorana chain of this type has exact zero majorana zero modes , i.e. the boundary operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 , commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , this property holds in the entire phase @xmath103 .",
    "hence , these majorana zero modes persist in this phase up to the critical point , @xmath104 , where they disappear as the mass gap closes , @xmath105 . in contrast",
    ", the opposite phase , @xmath106 , does not have majorana zero modes .",
    "the phase @xmath107 is the broken symmetry phase of the quantum ising chain . since in the ising model",
    "the majorana fermions are closely related with domain walls it is natural that there must be a connection between domain walls and majorana fermions .",
    "although they are related ( and are often confused with each other in the literature ) they are different states . since in the broken symmetry state , @xmath107 , the disorder operator @xmath108 does not have an expectation value , the domain walls are not condensed but are instead finite energy excitations .",
    "however , in the ising model only the parity of the number of domain walls is well defined , but not their actual number . for a chain with open boundary conditions",
    "it is possible to have a state with a domain walls bound to the endpoints of the chain .",
    "this is the state with majorana zero modes at the endpoints .",
    "majorana zero modes encode quantum information in a non - local fashion . to see this , we recall that the standard fermion representation of the quantum ising chain @xcite is written in terms of a set of _ dirac _ fermions operators , @xmath109 which obey canonical anticommutation relations , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in terms of dirac fermions , the hamiltonian takes the conventional form @xmath112\\ ] ] which has the form of a pairing hamiltonian familiar from the bcs theory of superconductivity ( or the bogoliubov - de gennes approximation ) @xcite .    for an chain with open boundary conditions",
    "all majorana fermion operators appear in pairs .",
    "however , in the @xmath107 phase the majorana operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 have no other operators left to pair - up with except each other .",

    "this pair of majorana fermions describes a system with just two quantum states , the empty state @xmath114 and occupied state @xmath115 .",
    "this part of the hilbert space of the chain is not localized anywhere in the chain . in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath68 , these two states become degenerate ( with zero energy )",
    "hence , two majorana zero modes define a single dirac fermion whose state is either occupied or empty .",
    "this non - local encoding of the properties of the state is what makes majorana zero modes interesting , particularly from the point of view of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "physical systems with majorana zero modes , in which the properties of the states are encoded non - locally are of great interest as possible platforms for topological quantum computing @xcite ( tqc ) .",
    "they include such as the fermionic zero modes trapped in the core of two - dimensional @xmath116 superconductors @xcite and in the paired states of the fractional quantum hall fluids @xcite , and in hybrid structures of superconductors with three - dimensional topological insulators @xcite .",
    "vortices with majorana zero modes becomes non - abelian anyons and encode information in a non - local way , which is why they are possible platforms for tqc .",
