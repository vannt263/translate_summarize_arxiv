    "multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mwcnts ) are the first discovered nanoscopic quasi-1d nanostructures @xcite .",
    "each mwcnt consists of some nested single - walled nanotubes ( shells ) held mostly by van der waals forces @xcite .",
    "the telescopic motion ability of inner shells @xcite and their unique mechanical properties @xcite permit to use multi - walled nanotubes as main movable arms in coming nanomechanical devices . the variety of gadgets of this kind was already suggested such as a possible mechanical gigahertz oscillator ( linear bearing ) @xcite , nanoswitch @xcite , nanorelay , nanogear @xcite , nanorail , reciprocating nanoengine @xcite .",
    "therefore the analysis of mechanic characteristics of mwcnt is an important objective of study .",
    "the present work is just devoted to a simplified continuum version of this problem .",
    "the continuum model for telescopic oscillations , in which each shell of mwcnt is considered as continuous infinitesimally thin cylinder is described in the next section .",
    "the third section devoted to the description of the small ( thermal ) and large - amplitude oscillations for dwcnt and mwcnt in the framework of proposed model .",
    "note that the similar continuum model was used recently for the investigation of the suction energy and large amplitude telescopic oscillations in dwcnt @xcite .",
    "the contribution of temperature - induced oscillations into the tubes heat capacity within debye model is also discussed . in the last section",
    "the obtained results are compared with the available experimental data @xcite .",
    "the interaction energy of two shells of the multi - walled tube is modelled as the sum of pair interaction potentials of atoms from different shells . in doing",
    "so we took for the potential energy of two atoms at the distance @xmath0 the lennard - jones potential @xmath1 with attractive and repulsive constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 borrowed from @xcite . in accordance with this approximation",
    "the total intertube interaction energy has form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are radius - vectors of the inner and outer tube s atoms respectively .    as in @xcite we used instead of ( [ 1.2 ] ) the continuum model , for which @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are inner and outer tubes radii , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are their lengthes ( from now on we assume that @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is the distance between tubes outer edges and @xmath14 is the surface density of carbon atoms in graphene , which almost independent on the tube chirality , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the interatomic distance in graphene .    the integration over variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be easily carried out analytically , but obtained expressions are too cumbersome to be presented here .",
    "it s trivial , that system energy is minimal when the inner tube is completely retracted into the outer tube . in terms of hypergeometric functions",
    "the minimum interaction energy is given by expression @xmath19 where @xmath20",
    "if the outer tube is rigidly mounted , then the longitudinal motion of the internal tube is described by primitive equation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the acceleration of the inner tube with mass @xmath23 .",
    "we ignore here the contribution of some defect - induced dissipative forces since for high - quality nanotubes they are several orders lower than the retraction force due to self - healing mechanism @xcite .    by ( [ 2.1 ] )",
    "the motion of inner tube is cyclic with period @xmath24 where @xmath25 is determined by relations @xmath26 .    due to the special form of potential ( [ 1.3 ] )",
    "we can separate out two limit form of motion :    \\1 ) steady movement for @xmath27 while the potential is just linear in @xmath28 ;    \\2 ) small oscillations when @xmath29 and the potential is just quadratic in @xmath28 .      in the case of displacement",
    "@xmath25 greater than few nanometers the potential energy is mostly linear with respect to displacement @xmath28 except small - displacement zone with quadratic potential energy contribution of which can be neglected . in such a case",
    "the oscillatory period can be derived from simple formulas for the steady and uniformly accelerated motion . for equal - lengthes tubes the period has form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the longitudinal component of retraction force : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is approximately constant for tubes of large radius .     on tube s radius for the 50nm - length dwcnt ]    in terms of the maximal displacement @xmath34 the period can be written as follows @xmath35    if @xmath36 then the steady motion contribution is included and @xmath37    @xmath38    since the period is proportional to the square root of inner tube mass , then for the same maximal displacements and the same immobile outer shell the oscillatory period of inner tube is proportional to the inverse square of its mass . at the same time the oscillatory period does not depend on tubes diameters .",
    "if the outer tube is also mobile , then the above expressions for periods remain valid with @xmath39 replaced by the reduced mass @xmath40 note that the interaction energy of atoms forming the tubes rapidly decreases with the interatomic distance .",
    "therefore it is enough to consider only interaction of adjacent tubes in mwcnt .",
    "since some adjacent shells of mwcnt can be rigidly glued by defects , then glued tubes should be considered as double - sided shells with integrated masses .      for low temperatures the telescopic oscillations are the least frequency 1d modes in dwcnt .",
    "therefore for @xmath41 by boltzmann theorem their energy is @xmath42    for small oscillations the maximal potential energy of dwcnt coincides with @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the rigidity parameter . taking into account that in the harmonic approximation rigidity is the potential energy second derivative with respect to the inner tube",
    "longitudinal displacement and assuming the tube s radius is much smaller of its length for @xmath46 yield @xmath47    the harmonic oscillations frequency for this @xmath48 is @xmath49 and the amplitude of longitudinal thermal oscillations can be estimated as follows @xmath50    we see in particular that @xmath25 is few times lesser than graphene lattice parameter .    to model the intertube interaction force @xmath51 in the case of @xmath52 depending on the inner tube edge position @xmath28 let us assume that the axis of outer tube coincides with the interval @xmath53 $ ] of real axis and introduce two parameters : @xmath54 @xmath55 ^ 6 }   \\right ] \\right . \\\\",

    "( @xmath60 ) @xmath51 can be written as follows @xmath61    here @xmath62 is the displacement , which makes the longitudinal retraction force equals to zero , @xmath63 is the dwcnt longitudinal rigidity and @xmath64 .    in case of tubes with significantly different lengths ( @xmath65 ) the formula ( [ 3.8 ] )",
    "takes on form @xmath66 and in the case of equal lengths @xmath67    the oscillation cycle can be considered as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the maximum inner tube velocity and @xmath70 is the system minimum potential energy defined by ( [ 1.5 ] ) . with an accuracy of several percent previous equation can by approximated by @xmath71    since the system s longitudinal rigidity depends only on the tubes radii and inner tube mass is directly proportional to the product of its length and radius , then @xmath72",
    "considering the long - amplitude oscillations of multi - walled nanotube we assumed that some nanotube s shells can be bounded by the defects , but in the case of thermal oscillations we should take into account the motion of all shells because amplitudes of their oscillations are of the same order and much lesser then interatomic distance .",
    "the mwcnt s thermal oscillations frequencies were obtained by solving the system of equations for longitudinal displacements of tubes with forces defined by the expression above for the intertube potential . in the continuum model",
    "arbitrary multi - walled nanotube can be characterized by the inner shell radius @xmath73 , number of shells @xmath74 under consideration and the constant distance between adjacent shells ( @xmath75 ) .    considering only adjacent shells interaction we find explicit values of the consequent mwcnt eigenfrequencies @xmath76 .",
    "the least eigenvalue is always equals to zero corresponding to the whole nanotube translational motion .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that the maximal frequency depends on the mwcnt characteristics but in case of tube with large number of shells ( @xmath77 ) it tends to the asymptotic value which depends only on the tubes length : @xmath78 the obtained value of maximal frequency is seems too low for real tubes because defects may rise the longitudinal rigidity of mwcnt .",
    "the minimal oscillation frequency strongly depends on the number of shells and can be found using the following interpolation formula @xmath79    using obtained frequencies we calculated the contribution of tube s telescopic oscillations to the individual mwcnt internal energy @xmath80 - 1 } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath82 is an absolute temperature , and specific heat @xmath83 } \\right)^2.\\ ] ] by ( [ 4.5 ] ) if @xmath84 , then @xmath85 while @xmath86 if @xmath87 .",
    "it is well known that under the debye temperature the bulk solid specific heat decreases as a cubic function of the temperature and for the one dimensional structures such decreasing is given by the linear function . in the case of mwcnts",
    "the telescopic oscillation induced specific heat decreases exponentially in the range of small temperatures and the corresponding debye - like temperature is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is given by ( [ 4.4 ] ) . as a result of mwcnts specific heat exponential decreasing their specific heat",
    "may be several orders higher that of environment for @xmath90 while for @xmath91 these values change over . for the natural carbon nanotubes @xmath92 varies in the interval @xmath93 .",
    "the explicit expressions for longitudinal rigidities and frequencies of small and large - amplitude telescopic oscillations of dwcnt and mwcnt were deduced in the framework of continuum lennard - jones model borrowed from @xcite .",
    "the difference between frequencies calculated by obtained formulas and those found by numerical methods with account of discrete structure of nanotubes lies within the @xmath94-range .",
    "besides the obtained frequencies of telescopic oscillations of mwcnt are in good agreement with available experimental data @xcite .",
    "therefore the considered lennard - jones continuum model is seemingly well facilitated for description of telescopic trembling of mwcnt .",
