    "the modeling of the time series of stock prices is a main issue in economics and finance and it is of a vital importance in the management of large portfolio of stocks . from a statistical physics point of view",
    ", one can think that the stock prices form a non - equilibrium system .",
    "we investigate the constituent stocks of the indexes dow jones industrial average ( djia30 ) and standard & poors 100 ( s&p100 ) , of the new york stock exchange market ( nyse ) , observed in the 21 years period , january 1987 to september 2008 , and comprising about 5470 trading days .",
    "surprisingly , in this paper , we observe the data collapse of the histograms of the djia30 price fluctuations and of the s&p100 price fluctuations to the bramwell - holdsworth - pinton ( bhp ) probability density function without any fitting .",
    "the universal nonparametric bhp pdf was discovered by bramwell , holdsworth and pinton @xcite .",
    "the universal nonparametric bhp pdf is the pdf of the fluctuations of the total magnetization , in the strong coupling ( low temperature ) regime for a two - dimensional spin model ( 2dxy ) , using the spin wave approximation .",
    "the magnetization distribution , that they found , is named , after them , the bramwell - holdsworth - pinton ( bhp ) distribution .",
    "the _ bhp probability density function ( pdf ) _ is given by @xmath0}\\nonumber\\\\\\ !",
    "& \\!&.e^{-\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\left[\\frac{1}{4}\\mbox{ln}{\\left(1+\\frac{x^2}{n^2\\lambda_k^2}\\right)}\\right]}\\ ,        \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath1 are the eigenvalues , as determined in @xcite , of the adjacency matrix .",
    "it follows , from the formula of the bhp pdf , that the asymptotic values for large deviations , below and above the mean , are exponential and double exponential , respectively ( in this article , we use the approximation of the bhp pdf obtained by taking @xmath2 and @xmath3 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "as we can see , the bhp distribution does not have any parameter ( except the mean that is normalize to 0 and the standard deviation that is normalized to 1 ) and it is universal , in the sense that appears in several physical phenomena .",
    "for instance , the universal nonparametric bhp distribution is a good model to explain the fluctuations of order parameters in theoretical examples such as , models of self - organized criticality , equilibrium critical behavior , percolation phenomena ( see @xcite ) , the sneppen model ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and auto - ignition fire models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the universal nonparametric bhp distribution is , also , an explanatory model for fluctuations of several phenomenon such as , width power in steady state systems ( see @xcite ) , fluctuations in river heights and flow ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and for the plasma density fluctuations and electrostatic turbulent fluxes measured at the scrape - off layer of the alcator c - mod tokamaks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , gonalves , pinto and stollenwerk @xcite observed that the wolf s sunspot numbers fluctuates according to the universal nonparametric bhp distribution for , both , the ascending and descending phases .",
    "surprisingly , we observe the data collapse of the djia30 price fluctuations and of the s&p100 price fluctuations to the bramwell - holdsworth - pinton ( bhp ) probability density function ( pdf ) . hence , our result reveals an universal feature of the daily returns of the stock prices in the djia30 and s&p100 index .",
    "the s&p 100 index is a subset of the s&p 500 and is comprised of 100 leading u.s .",
    "stocks with exchange - listed options .",
    "the constituents of the s&p 100 represent about @xmath4 of the market capitalization of the s&p 500 .",
    "the stocks in the s&p 100 are generally among the largest companies in the s&p 500 .",
    "the variable investigated in our analysis is the _ re - scaled daily return _ defined by @xmath5 where the stock @xmath6 has a closure price @xmath7 in the day @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the number of stocks considered in the s&p 100 .",
    "we define the _",
    "mean @xmath10 of the re - scaled daily return _",
    "by @xmath11 we define the _ standard deviation @xmath12 of the re - scaled daily return _ by @xmath13        in figure [ fig1 ] , we show the mean and standard deviation of the re - scaled daily return .",

    "_ @xmath14 by @xmath15        in figure [ fig2 ] , we show the histogram of the s&p100 price fluctuations with the bhp pdf on top .",
    "since the bhp pdf is non - parametric , we observe the data collapse of the histogram of the s&p100 fluctuations to the bhp pdf ( without any fitting ) .",
    "the djia30 consists of 30 of the largest and most widely held public companies in the united states .",
    "the variable investigated in our analysis is the _ re - scaled daily return _ defined by @xmath16 where the stock @xmath6 has a closure price @xmath17 in the day @xmath8 .",
