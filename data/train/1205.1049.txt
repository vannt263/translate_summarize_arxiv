    "as recently reviewed by @xcite , the possibility that globular clusters may contain intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) has received considerable attention , particularly in the past decade .",
    "an extrapolation of the relation between central black hole mass and velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) for galaxies implies that globular clusters may harbor black holes with masses in the range of @xmath2 .",
    "there have been a number of suggestions that the prototypical collapsed - core globular cluster m15 may contain a central black hole with mass of near @xmath3 .",
    "a central black hole has been invoked in m15 to explain both the central surface - brightness cusp @xcite and the central rise of the velocity dispersion profile observed both from the ground @xcite and by _ hst _ @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have presented dynamically evolving models for m15 that provide good fits to the surface - brightness and velocity - dispersion profiles _ without _ the inclusion of a central black hole .",
    "instead , in these models , centrally concentrated populations of massive white dwarfs and neutron stars dominate the gravitational potential in the central region . after some initial uncertainty caused by plotting errors in @xcite , and rectified in @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that the @xcite models do , in fact , fit the _",
    "velocities reported by @xcite , without the addition of a black hole . using proper motions of stars @xcite also concluded there is little direct evidence for an imbh in m15 . using equilibrium models @xcite reached a similar conclusion .",
    "@xcite and @xcite failed to detect x - ray or radio emission coincident with the cluster center .",
    "this is not necessarily inconsistent with an imbh , since the accretion rate and/or the accretion efficiency are likely to be low .",
    "nonetheless , m15 does not appear to be a strong candidate to harbor an imbh .",
    "the population of @xmath4 neutron stars included in the @xcite models follows from the adoption of a reasonable initial mass function ( imf ) , an inferred total cluster mass of @xmath5 , and the assumption that _ all _ of the neutron stars are retained after formation . as we extensively discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this last assumption is the least certain , given the likelihood that a substantial fraction of the neutron stars formed in clusters will be immediately ejected by their large birth kicks . @xcite",
    "have examined this issue , noting that while consideration of birth kicks suggests that the retention fraction should be in the range @xmath6 , x - ray evidence suggests that it may approach 20% in some clusters , producing populations of up to 1000 neutron stars in rich clusters .",
    "@xcite found similar estimates for retention fractions of neutron stars born in binaries .",
    "@xcite argued that the neutron star population adopted in the @xcite models is implausibly large and thus that it is reasonable to effectively replace part of the inferred neutron star population with a central imbh of mass @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that our fokker - planck models only require that there be a population of nonluminous remnants with masses in excess of about 1.2  ; it is not necessary that all of these objects be neutron stars .",
    "the imf plays a critical role in the dynamical evolution of a cluster .",
    "this is particularly the case for a core - collapsed cluster , in which extreme mass segregation causes the massive white dwarfs and neutron stars to dominate the central region .",
    "the distribution of these massive remnants gives us a constraint on the upper end of the imf .",
    "dynamical models for clusters provide a key means of probing the distributions of these extremely faint stars , which presently elude optical detection .    there is a significant increase in the quantity and quality of the data available for detailed modeling of m15 since the @xcite models were developed .",
    "thus , we have developed new fokker - planck models for m15 , to fit these data , that address the issue of the necessity of a central black hole .",
    "hst _ imaging studies have provided a wealth of information on globular cluster structure , stellar content , and kinematics .",
    "this is particularly true for the central regions of high density clusters , which were largely inaccessible from the ground before the _ hst_-era , owing to severe crowding of stellar images .",
    "this has allowed an examination of cluster mass functions to unprecedented depth @xcite . in all three of these studies ,",
    "multi - mass king models were fit to the mass - function and kinematic data to constrain cluster structure parameters .",
    "in less crowded outer regions of clusters , _ hst _ imaging has been used to detect stellar masses near the hydrogen burning limit of the main sequence in ngc  6397 @xcite and in m4 @xcite . in the central regions of clusters ,",
    "these improved observations allow us to investigate the details of the core collapse process .",
    "a predicted observational signature of core collapse is the presence of a central power - law surface density cusp surrounding a small , possibly unresolved core @xcite .",
    "ground - based observations of surface - brightness profiles have detected central cusps that are interpreted as being due to core collapse in at least 21 globular clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ hst _ imaging studies of star count profiles have confirmed the presence of these cusps in a number of clusters , including m15 @xcite , m30 @xcite , and ngc  6397 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have analyzed _ hst _",
    "profiles for 38 clusters , finding that about half of the sample has a central power - law cusp , with a range of slopes",
    ".    an important predicted outcome of the dynamical evolution leading to core collapse is that substantial mass segregation will occur within the half - mass radius of a cluster @xcite .",
    "more massive stars will lose energy to lower mass stars and sink closer to the cluster center , as the stellar energy distribution tends towards equipartition .",
    "indications that the stellar populations in the central cusp regions have been modified by close stellar encounters provide other evidence of the occurrence of core collapse in clusters .",
    "these include color gradients in the sense of inward bluing @xcite , a central deficit of bright red giants @xcite , and centrally concentrated populations of both blue stragglers @xcite and millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "m15 ( ngc 7078 ) has long been regarded as the prototypical core - collapsed cluster .",
    "in addition to its central surface - density cusp , it has other evidence of a high rate of stellar interactions in its central region including eight millisecond pulsars @xcite , a blue straggler population @xcite , three low - mass x - ray binaries , ac  211 , m15 x-2 , and x-3 @xcite , and at least one cataclysmic variable located in the cluster core @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have found evidence for centrally concentrated populations of close binary candidates in m15 , including cataclysmic variables and helium white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have fitted fokker - planck models to the surface - brightness and velocity - dispersion profiles of m15 and found that it was best fit with a global mass function having a power - law index of @xmath8 , where 1.35 is the salpeter index .",
    "these models also containned a sizable population of nonluminous objects with masses in excess of 1  . in @xcite ,",
    "the most massive of these objects were taken to be neutron stars with masses of 1.4 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found evidence for strong mass segregation in m15 , using the _ hst _ faint object camera ( foc ) and wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) imaging , respectively . at radii of 5 , 20 , and 4.5",
    "they found that the mass function had a power - law slope of @xmath9 , 0.2 , 2.1 , respectively , for stellar masses from 0.78 to 0.60  ( where the salpeter slope is 1.35 ) .",
    "significant mass segregation has also been found in a number of other clusters , including m71 @xcite , 47  tuc @xcite , ngc  6397 @xcite , and m30 @xcite .",
    "@xcite fitted a king - michie model to the observed data set for m15 and found they could explain the observed mass segregation , but that they could not accurately reproduce the mass function in the central cusp nor the gravitational potential of the cluster . @xcite",
    "have supplemented the @xcite mass - function dataset with _ hst _",
    "nicmos observations at 7 , and fitted this combined dataset together with several kinematic datasets with a king - michie model .",
    "the resulting fit is more succesful than that of @xcite , most likely due to the inclusion of a much larger population of massive remnants .",
    "king - michie models , which are non - evolving , may not accurately represent the current dynamical state of a post - collapse cluster such as m15 .",
    "these models are likely to substantially underestimate the degree of mass segregation that occurs in the core and may thus provide a poor constraint on the remnant population .",
    "m15 provides us with an excellent opportunity to examine the imf of globular clusters . in all likelihood",
    "it has undergone little tidal stripping due to its position and orbit in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the fact that m15 is a post - core collapse cluster also allows us to probe the upper main sequence of the imf . because the slope of the surface - brightness cusp is dependent upon the mass of the most massive stellar remnants we can estimate the number of nonluminous remnants present in m15 @xcite .",
    "m15 s low metallicity ( z=0.0001 ) implies that neutron stars were formed from progenitor stars of 6.4  and above @xcite . from this",
    "we can estimate the slope of the imf above this mass .",
    "the availability of detailed velocity profiles and millisecond pulsar accelerations for m15 also aids in the estimate of the amount of mass in massive nonluminous remnants @xcite .      in this paper we present dynamically evolving fokker - planck models of m15 that are more detailed than those of previous investigations .",
    "we fit these models to _ hst _ observations of stellar mass functions at several radii by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition we fit our models to the velocity dispersion data of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in ",
    "2 we describe our models .",
    "the results and a newly determined best - fitting fokker - planck model for m15 are presented in  3 .",
    "section 4 summarizes our findings and discusses their implications .",
    "as in our previous modeling of m15 @xcite , our basic approach is to adopt a global stellar mass function , generate evolving fokker - planck models for this mass function , compare these models with the observed surface - density and velocity dispersion profiles at a number of epochs , and adjust the adopted mass function to achieve agreement with the observations .",
    "our previous modeling of m15 adopted a power - law form for most of the range of the stellar mass function @xcite .",
    "the direct observation of local stellar mass functions by _ hst _ studies provides an important new constraint in the fitting process , that allows the use of a more complex form for the mass function . since _",
    "observations are now able to probe the stellar mass function to near the hydrogen burning limit of the main sequence @xcite , modeling these observations requires good resolution of the mass function using 20 or more mass groups ; in our previous modeling we had used seven groups @xcite . our goal in the present study is to constrain the form of the global mass function by fitting observed local mass functions at several radii .",
    "our globular cluster models are generated using the multi - mass direct fokker - planck method , which is based on a smooth , continuous description of the spatial structure of a cluster @xcite . in this approach , each stellar mass group is represented by a statistical distribution function in orbital energy .",
    "the dynamical evolution of these distribution functions due to the effects of star - star gravitional scattering are followed in a diffusive approximation , in which the cumulative effects of more frequent distant encounters dominate those of less frequent close encounters .",
    "the gravitational potential due to the stellar distribution is determined self - consistently , yielding the time evolution of the structure of the model globular cluster . using this method",
    "we were able to follow the evolution of a set of initial models through the first core collapse and the subsequent post - collapse evolutionary phase using heating via dynamically formed binaries @xcite .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite and @xcite , energy input into the cluster core from interactions involving close binaries is expected to halt core collapse and drive a post - collapse oscillatory phase .",
    "binaries may be present in the cluster from primordial formation and/or may be formed by two - body tidal capture and three - body dynamical processes .",
    "m15 likely has few binaries in its core due to its being in deep collapse .",
    "deep collapse of a cluster is an indication that it has `` burned '' most of the primordial binaries near its center @xcite .",
    "we begin our models with a mass - density distribution represented by a plummer model ( @xmath10 polytrope ) .",
    "all models start with the mass groups having identical velocity distributions , as expected after violent relaxation @xcite .",
    "this velocity equipartition is quickly replaced by energy equipartition , causing the most massive stars to sink to the cluster center as the cluster evolves dynamically @xcite .",
    "large - scale central density oscillations appear soon after the initial collapse .",
    "these oscillations have been observed in conducting gas - sphere models , fokker - planck models , and @xmath11-body simulations @xcite . as discussed in our previous work ,",
    "the core radius lies close to its maximally expanded size over most of an oscillation cycle . for a cluster at a distance of @xmath12 , such as m15",
    ", this corresponds to an angular scale of @xmath13 , which is similar to observational upper limits on the core radius of m15 from _ hst _ imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we typically evolve our models through core collapse and into the post - collapse phase , to provide a wide choice of evolutionary phases with which to fit the observations .",
    "recently @xcite has suggested that clusters like m15 may still be in a binary burning state rather one of deep collapse ; we note that this results in a similar core radius to that achieved in a post - collapse core bounce .",
    "our models of m15 approximate the present - day stellar mass function with a set of 20 discrete evolved mass groups .",
    "this mass resolution has allowed us to investigate the effects of mass segregation on the local mass function",
    ". rather than explicitly include continuous stellar evolution mass loss , which is most important in the early evolutionary phases , we use a static _ present - day _ mass function for all epochs of our models , derived from the imf by transforming post - main - sequence stars to appropriate remnant masses .",
    "this present - day evolved mass function takes into account stellar evolution that has modified the upper imf over the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "for this study we were mainly interested in the final remnant mass of stars so that we could determine the number and mass of the objects in each of our remnant mass bins . to determine the initial main sequence to final remnant masses for these bins we used the stellar evolution models described by @xcite . from their fitting formula",
    "we were able to determine the mass of the remnants produced by upper main sequence stars of the imf .",
    "five of the twenty mass groups represent degenerate stars , two represent post - main sequence stars ( horizontal branch and red giant ) , and 13 mass groups represent the main sequence stars over the mass range 0.8 to 0.1 . using a metallicity of z=0.0001 in the @xcite models results in significantly more massive white dwarfs than would solar metallicity .",
    "also neutron stars are produced from progenitor stars as low as 6.43  from this low metallicity .",

    "we assume that neutron stars originate from stars with initial masses from 6.43 to 22 solar masses as prescribed by @xcite .",
    "the properties of each stellar group are listed in table  1 .",
    "changing the upper mass limit for neutron star progenitors has only a small effect on the total number of neutron stars produced . because neutron stars receive a sizeable velocity kick at birth @xcite , it is likely that a significant fraction has been ejected from the cluster .",
    "we therefore allowed the number of neutron stars to be lower than would otherwise be presumed from the imf . for a globular cluster similar to m15 ,",
    "the central escape velocity is typically on the order of 50 . for the pulsar velocity distribution of @xcite ,",
    "fewer than 10% of the original neutron stars may be present @xcite .",
    "this quantity might be higher if one assumes that some of the neutron stars originated in binary stars @xcite .",
    "an important goal of the present study has been to determine the minimum retention fraction for which we are able to fit the m15 observations . for other degenerate groups we assumed that all stars are retained in the cluster .",
    "the stellar mass of each white dwarf bin is given in table 1 , along with the assumed progenitor masses .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf bins were selected using a prescription of @xcite .",
    "using this method , we determined the number of remnant stars present by integrating the imf over the various range of masses above the current turnoff mass .",
    "stellar mass black holes are not included in these models for several reasons . as with neutron stars black holes",
    "may receive a birth kick @xcite .",
    "if this does occur then very few black holes would be retained by the cluster .",
    "even if there were no birth kick most of the black holes produce by a typical mass function would likely be ejected .",
    "given the mass difference compared to the rest of the cluster stars these stellar mass black holes would undergo rapid dynamical evolution , quickly segregate to the cluster core , and decouple from the rest of the cluster @xcite .",
    "this central cluster of black holes would then form binaries that would then cause them to be ejected from the system a relatively short time @xcite .",
    "our models can be described by three different parameters , the present - day total mass of the cluster , the initial half - mass radius of the cluster , and the stellar mass function parameter set .",
    "we first considered an imf similar to that inferred by @xcite .",
    "the fokker - planck model was first run with this mass function , then the results were examined to determine if a fit could be made , at some epoch , to all three local mass functions found by @xcite and @xcite at 5 , 20 , and 4.5 . from this first model we were able to gauge what adjustments",
    "were necessary to the imf , the half - mass radius , and the cluster mass .",
    "we revised the model until it satisfactorily matched the mass - function observations at the three radii at some epoch .",
    "the models were fit to four types of data : the mass - function data at the three radii , star - count profiles for three luminosity ranges , the velocity - dispersion profile , and millisecond pulsar acceleration measurements .",
    "a model was deemed acceptable if it satisfactorily matched all four of these data sets .",
    "@xcite present radial star - count profiles for several magnitude ranges . for a comparison with their results we converted our stellar mass functions to luminosity functions using the mass to luminosity relation ( mlr ) of @xcite .",
    "we assumed a distance modulus of 15.4 , identical to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these mlrs allow us to make a direct comparison to the star count data of @xcite at radii of 5  and 20 .",
    "the mlr is uncertain for low metallicities and low masses @xcite , so we concentrated on fitting the mass function for stellar masses above 0.4 .",
    "the best - fitting model has a mass of @xmath29  and a half - mass radius of 3.4 parsecs .",
    "this mass is similar to that found by @xcite .",
    "the model was found to fit best in the post - core collapse phase .",
    "while a fit of the model at the initial collapse gave reasonable results , we found that the post - collapse phase provided a better fit to both the local mass functions and the star - count data .",
    "we tried to fit a number of models at several points during a post - collapse phase , including both expansion and recollapse phases .",
    "we found that the maximally expanded model could not account for the measured pulsar accelerations .",
    "in addition to the finding the best epoch to fit the model we found the slope of the upper imf is constrained by the number of neutrons and massive white dwarfs needed to flatten the surface - brightness profile of the cluster and produce a large enough pulsar acceleration . the imf slope could be steepened but then an unrealistic percentage of neutron stars would have to be retained .",
    "the break points in the mass function below the turn - off mass are primarly constrained by the slope of the observed mass function at 4.5 .",
    "break points significantly different than those listed in table 2 led to a poor fit of the observed mass function at all radii .",

    "note that the @xcite data only show stellar masses down to 0.6 and 0.5   for radii of 5 , 20 , respectively , due to observational limitations in the cluster cusp described earlier .",

    "the king - michie model of @xcite matches the surface brightness profile and the luminosity functions , while also providing a reasonable fit to the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "as discussed below , this appears to be a consequence of retaining all of the neutron stars produced from the imf .",
    "our model has a much more realistic retention fraction of 5% .",

    "the model of @xcite ( labeled  king  in fig",
    ".  9 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) failed to fit the accelerations ( as well as the central the velocity dispersion profile ) because they had very few massive remnants in their model , 21% at 0.55  and less than 1% in a 1.55  bin . because most of their remnants were in a lower mass bin , very few nonluminous remnants segregated into the cusp region of the cluster .",
    "@xcite did not consider the pulsar accelerations .",
    "because mass segregation modifies the observed mass function , one would be curious to see whether there is any region of the cluster where the local mass function is a close approximation to the global mass function .",

    "this is due to the very long relaxation times at these large radii .",

    "this slope applies to the region where massive remnants ( @xmath60 ) dominate the surface density .",
    "this corresponds to a radius inside of 5  for our models , as seen in the surface - density profiles of our best - fitting model shown in figure 4 .",
    "outside of this radius the surface - density slope slowly steepens and does not have a power - law form .",
    "the models presented here require a total population of about 1600 neutron stars , which is a dramatic reducion relative to the @xmath61 neutron stars in the @xcite models .",
    "this appears to be much more realistic .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible that some of the 1.2 and 1.4  objects may be represented by nonluminous , tightly bound white - dwarf binaries . in our models",
    "32% of the total mass of the cluster is in white dwarf bins with masses 0.7 and 0.95 .",
    "it could be that these objects have undergone exchange reactions with primordial binaries composed originally of lower - mass main - sequence stars , via 3-body or binary - binary interactions @xcite .",
    "this would not lower the number of single white dwarfs in the core significantly , due to their large numbers , but would add to the 1.4  bin .",
    "these binaries could not be present in large numbers in the form of main - sequence pairs .",
    "such main - sequence binaries would have an magnitude of roughly 19 and would be apparent in the star count profiles of @xcite , for the magnitude range 18.25 to 19.75 , in the form of a steeper profile . if main - sequence binaries more massive than the turnoff did represent a sizeable fraction of the stars in this magnitude range , they would cause the profile to be much steeper than is observed .",
    "one last explanation for the central slope of the surface density profile of m15 is the possible presence of a massive central black hole .",
    "the slope of the star count profile tends to be near @xmath62 .",
    "this is very similar to the @xmath63 expected from a massive black hole @xcite . in the multi - mass case",
    "the slope of the projected star - count profiles in a keplerian potential are given by @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "note that if objects more massive than the turnoff stars dominate the stellar density , then the turnoff stars will have a slope slightly less than @xmath63 @xcite . also note that the minimum slope possible for any group can not be less than @xmath65 if a massive black hole is responsible for the cusp .",
    "though the @xcite data do show this trend , it should be pointed out that in order to achieve these slopes out to 10 , the central black hole would have to have a mass in excess of 5000 .",
    "other evidence against a massive central black hole comes from the velocity - dispersion measurements of @xcite and @xcite , which show a gradual rather than a steep rise in the velocity dispersion .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the keplerian potential of a massive black hole is expected to rise as @xmath66 as opposed to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , there is little need to invoke the presence of an imbh in m15 on the basis of our model fitting .",
    "this is in accord with the conclusion by @xcite that the significant central dark mass concentration in m15 can either be in the form of an imbh , individual objects , or a combination of these .",
    "one useful aspect of our models is that they can help guide obsevers as to what radii should be observed in order to best retrieve the global mass function .",
    "we find that observations near the half - mass radius give the best results for two reasons .",
    "first mass segregation has not altered the mass function as much as in the inner regions and second , tidal effects have likely had less effect at this radius than further out .",
    "obtaining data at center of the cluster , 1 parsec from the center , and at the half - mass radius appear to be the best method for retrieving the global imf .",
    "these radii are nearly identical to the data we have fit from @xcite . for clusters that are nearer to the sun",
    "it is important that observations be spaced accordingly .",
    "@xcite shows an example of what may happen when local mass functions are determined at two adjacent radial bins in the cusp of a cluster . for m30 ( ngc  7099 ) , sosin examined local mass functions in bins centered at 3  and 9  from the cluster center , which corresponds to 0.1 and 0.3 parsecs , respectively .",
    "these radii are similar to our second and third curves in figure 7 .",
    "figure 7 shows that the slope of the mass function above 0.4  remains nearly constant at these small radii , even the though relative numbers of stars have changed .",
    "this should not be looked at as a sign of little mass segregation .",
    "this same effect would be seen even for a cluster in deep core collapse or bounce .",
    "this highlights the importance of radially spacing observations in globular clusters .",
    "@xcite did obtain a hst foc field at 20 , but unfortunately the field was not usable due to the presence of a bright giant .    comparing our results with those of @xcite ,",
    "we obtain a similar slope of the imf above 0.55 . below this mass",
    ", there are detailed differences in the mass function , but an overall trend of flattening or turnover . for both sets of models",
    ", there is a substantial amount of mass in remnants . for our models ,",
    "the total mass in remnants is 46% of the cluster mass with 21% of the cluster mass in remnants above the turnoff mass .",
    "given the evolving nature of our models , they are likely to provide a more realistic description of mass segregation and the central gravitational potential of m15 .",
    "we have fitted dynamically evolving fokker - planck models to a wide variety of data for m15 , including _ hst _",
    "observations of the stellar mass function at several radii , the star - count profiles , the velocity dispersion profile , and radio measurements of millisecond pulsar accelerations .",
    "we infer that m15 has a relatively flat imf slope of @xmath68 or flatter . with a modest retention fraction of 5% , we infer that m15 presently contains 1560 neutron stars .",
    "while of order this amount of 1.4  objects is required to fit the data , some of these may be in the form of tightly - bound white dwarf pairs .",
    "the central cusp region is dominated by 1.2  white dwarfs , which represent about 7% of the cluster mass . for a low - metallicity cluster like m15 ,",
    "a substantial number of white dwarfs are formed in this mass range @xcite .",
    "because of mass segregation , the global mass function is not replicated at any point in the cluster .",
    "however , the local and global mass functions come closest to each other near the half - mass radius of the cluster .",
    "we conclude that there is no need to invoke the presence of an imbh in m15 .",
    "the presence of massive white dwarfs and neutron stars provides the necessary central gravitational potential to fit the surface density profile , the velocity dispersion profile , and the millisecond pulsar accelerations ."
