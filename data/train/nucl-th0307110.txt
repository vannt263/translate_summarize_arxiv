    "the na50-collaboration  @xcite observed quite different @xmath4 and @xmath0-nucleon cross sections .",
    "analogous results have been found at fermilab  @xcite : both experiments found that the charmonium - nucleon cross section is larger in the target fragmention region than at midrapidity .",
    "this is in good agreement with models that assume that the @xmath0 is produced as colorless , point - like @xmath2 pair , which expands with time to its full size and that there exists a relationship between the spatial distribution of color in a hadron and the cross section of its interaction with a nucleon .",
    "such a relation is proved in pqcd ( perturbative qcd )  @xcite . for the nonperturbative regime",
    "it is a well known experimental fact that spatially larger hadrons have larger interaction cross sections .",
    "for example , 3.5 mb for the inelastic @xmath4-nucleon cross section was found at slac  @xcite while the inelastic @xmath5-nucleon cross section at this energies is 20 mb . from charmonium models ,",
    "e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite it is known that the different charmonium states ( @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 ) have different spatial sizes .",
    "we concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite that these cross sections are dominated by non - perturbative contributions .",
    "the agreement of this scenario with the negative @xmath7 fermilab data  @xcite with was first demonstrated in ref .",
    "another attempt to describe these data with such an expansion scenario was done in ref .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite 20%-50% of the suppression of charmonium states is due to a color octet state added to the model to explain also the large @xmath7 regime .",
    "this state as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite is in variance with qcd , because of the following reason .",
    "the eigen life time of this state adjusted to the fermilab data is only 0.06  fm .",
    "a gluon emitted in such a short time has to have a momentum of @xmath8  gev relative to the @xmath2 pair  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this gluon was assumed to be massless .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the production of @xmath4 s in pa collisions can be described , if one takes into account the production and the subsequent decays of higher resonances ( @xmath6,@xmath0 ) into @xmath4 s .",
    "this leads to a significant increase of the absorption of @xmath4 s as compared to the propagation of genuine @xmath4-states . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown also that the production of @xmath4 s in aa collisions is additionally suppressed by the final state interaction of charmonium states with newly produced particles like @xmath5 s , @xmath9 s and so on .    in sect .",
    "[ model ] the used models are introduced and in sect .",
    "[ data ] they are compared to the data .",
    "a more detailed description can be found in ref .",
    "we summarize in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the suppression factor @xmath10 for minimum bias @xmath11 collisions can be evaluated within the semiclassical approximation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) as @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the local nuclear ground state density ( we used the standard parametrisation from  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath14 is the interaction cross section of the charmonium state @xmath15 with a nucleon and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the production cross section of the state @xmath15 in a pa ( pp ) collision .",
    "we want to draw attention to the fact that this cross section changes with time due to the space - time evolution of color fluctuations .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to keep @xmath18 under the integral .",
    "the suppression factor @xmath10 of @xmath4 s produced in the nuclear medium is calculated as : @xmath19 here @xmath20 are the respective suppression factors of the different pure charmonium states @xmath15 in nuclear matter .",
    "( [ mix ] ) accounts for the decay of higher resonances after they left the target nucleus into @xmath4 s .",
    "the fractions of @xmath21 that are produced in the decays of higher resonances in eq .",
    "( [ mix ] ) are taken from ref .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it is assumed that the different charmonium states interact with nucleons with the same cross section , which is in disagreement with the data from the refs .",
    "@xcite .    in line with the above discussion",
    "we want to stress here that eqs .",
    "( [ glaub ] )  and  ( [ mix ] ) are applicable at cern energies for central and negative rapidities , but have to be modified , if applied already at @xmath22 at rhic or higher energies , because at higher energies charmonium states can be produced outside of the nucleus and the @xmath2 pairs propagate through the whole nucleus without forming a hadron .",
    "data are often presented in the form @xmath23 vs. a , where @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 in the semiclassical glauber approximation , we take into account these color fluctuations in an effective way as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we assume that charmonium states are produced at @xmath25 as small @xmath2 configurations predominantly through gluon - gluon - fusion , then they evolve  during the formation time @xmath26  to their full size .",
    "please note that there is up to now no theoretical or experimental proof for the assumption that charmonium states are produced in point - like configurations as predicted in pqcd .",
    "a way to test this experimentally was suggested recently in ref .",
    "it s based on the idea that the @xmath0 and the @xmath27 are mixed states of the @xmath28 and the @xmath29 charmonium states .",
    "the names of these states comes from a comparison of nonrelativistic charmonium models with the nonrelativistic wave functions of the positronium ( actually even the name charm_onium _ was given to pronounce the similarity with positr_onium _ ) .",
    "namely @xmath30 since only the @xmath10-wave contributes to the decay of @xmath31 states into @xmath32-pairs ( at least in nonrelativistic charmonium models ) the value of @xmath33 can be determined from the data on the @xmath32 decay widths of @xmath0 and @xmath27 .",
    "if the production of these charmonium states is pointlike , then only the @xmath10-wave is produced .",
    "these leads to an universal ratio of @xmath34 @xmath35 resp .",
    "@xmath36 are here the production cross sections of the @xmath27 and resp .",
    "@xmath0 in various processes .",
    "predictions for different processes can be found in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "if the formation length of the charmonium states , @xmath37 , becomes larger than the average internucleon distance ( @xmath38 fm ) , one has to take into account the evolution of the cross sections with the distance from the production point  @xcite . here",
    "we assume motivated by quantum diffusion that the cross section increases linearly with time .",
    "the formation length of the @xmath4 is given by the energy denominator @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the momentum of the @xmath4 in the rest frame of the target .",
    "with @xmath41 gev , the momentum of a @xmath4 produced at midrapidity at sps energies ( @xmath42 agev ) , this yields @xmath43 fm , i.e.  a proper formation time of @xmath44 fm . as formation time of the @xmath0 in its rest system",
    "we use here the radius given by nonrelativistic charmonium models , e.g. see the refs .",
    "this radius is @xmath45 fm for the @xmath0 .",
    "a larger value of @xmath46 for the @xmath0 is supported also by the extraction of the formation time of the @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "finally the formation time is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the the lorentz - factor of the charmonium state relativ to the nuclear target . for higher gamma factors ,",
    "i.e. at higher energies , the formation time becomes larger than the nuclear targets .",
    "in this regime a hadronic description during the formation time is questionable . a partonic model for this energy range was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the vdm ( vector dominance model ) takes into account only the direct diffractive production of the @xmath4 and the @xmath0 , while the gvdm ( generalized vector dominance model ) accounts also for the non - diagonal transitions ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "the later are needed , because in photoproduction the particles are produced as point like configurations and develop then to their average size . in a hadronic model like the gvdm this is taken into account in form of the interference due to the nondiagonal matrix elements . in the gvdm",
    "the photoproduction amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the @xmath4 and the @xmath0 are given by  @xcite @xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 coupling and @xmath58 are the amplitudes for the processes @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the @xmath4 and the @xmath0 respectively . in the vdm",
    "the non - diagonal amplitudes with @xmath62 are neglected .",
    "the importance of the nondiagonal transitions is evident , because the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gvdm ] ) is small . if it is neglected as a first approximation  @xcite , then @xmath63 . and due to the cpt - theorem @xmath64 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the gvdm yields approximately @xmath65 mb for the @xmath0-nucleon interaction cross section at sps - energies as can be seen in fig .  1 .",
    "@xmath66 is the laboratory energy of the photon .",
    "the @xmath4-nucleon interaction cross section at sps - energies approximately 3.5 - 4 mb is used as input into the analysis of ref .",
    "the accuracy of such gvdm in predicting the @xmath0n cross sections is not clear .",
    "the above calculation demonstrates that implementing color transparency leads to significantly larger cross sections of the @xmath0 n interaction .",
    "in fig .  2 we show a comparison between calculations with different cross sections and different expansion times and the na50 data  @xcite for pa collisions and the na51 data  @xcite for pp and pd collisions for the cross section of @xmath0 n interaction vs. the mass of the target .",
    "the y - axis shows @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the branching ratio for the decay of the @xmath0 into dimuon pairs .",
    "and @xmath69 is the production cross section .",
    "the `` 5.1 mb , instant formation '' curve in fig .  2 is the fit of the na50 collaboration to their data .",
    "instant formation means that they assumed that the @xmath0 is produced with the full cross section and not as a point like particle as in the description of this paper .",
    "( note the na50 collaboration fitted @xmath70 , where @xmath71 means drell - yan , we multiplied this fit with the @xmath71 cross section in pp collisions measured by na51 ) .",
    "the `` 8 mb , @xmath72  fm '' curve is the eye - ball fit of the model described in this paper . for the comparison with the data we need the production cross section of the @xmath0 in pp collisions as input .",
    "we used here the average of the pp and pd data of the na51 collaboration .",
    "the value of 8 mb agrees well with the model parametrisations discussed in the sections  [ model ] .",
    "however , we compare also with the calculation with the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath73  mb and @xmath74  fm . for this comparison we used the production cross section of the @xmath0 in pd collisions divided by two as input .",
    "this is also close to the value of the na50 fit .",
    "one can see in fig .  2 that the calculation with these parameters is also in good agreement with the data . a value for @xmath75 of the size of 20 mb is favored by the nucleus - nucleus data as shown in ref",
    "@xcite and in fig .  3 . plotted is @xmath76 with the absorption cross sections from ref .",
    "@xcite and the na50 data  @xcite for pbpb collisions vs. the transverse energy @xmath77 , a measure for the centrality of the collision .",
    "the calculation agrees well with the data .",
    "the calculation for the @xmath0 underestimates the data .",
    "however it is not understood , if this is due to the high value of @xmath73  mb , or if nondiagonal transitions like in sect .",
    "[ vdm ] should be taken into    account in aa collisions , too .",
    "the value of 8 mb is smaller than the theoretical estimate 20 mb of ref .",
    "this is because in ref .",
    "@xcite a formation time of 0.6 fm was chosen for the @xmath0 , while we used her 0.45 fm , the radius of the @xmath0 given by the charmonium models .",
    "the fact that the formation time is not known very well is another theoretical uncertainty .",
    "further uncertainty comes from using diffusion model of expansion at the distances comparable to the scale of the soft interaction . within",
    "the error bars the @xmath0-nucleon cross section extracted from these pa data and the prediction of the gvdm , discussed in sect .",
    "[ vdm ] , are qualitatively similar .",
    "however , further data are needed to learn more about this cross section .",
    "the new data of the na50-collaboration  @xcite and the data of the e866-collaboration  @xcite prove that the @xmath0-nucleon cross section is much larger than the @xmath4-nucleon cross section .",
    "this is in agreement with the photoproduction data for these charmonium states as discussed in the framework of the gvdm in section  [ vdm ] .",
    "this confirms the qcd prediction that the strength of hadron - hadron interactions depends on the volume occupied by color .    within the assumption that charmonium states are produced as point like white states",
    ", we demonstrated that the data  @xcite can be fitted with a @xmath0-nucleon cross section of @xmath78  mb .",
    "however , a much larger cross section of e.g.  @xmath79  mb is not ruled out by the data . due to the large experimental errors we conclude that the data and the qcd - motivated models agree , but further data with higher accuracy and covering larger rapidity range are needed .",
    "this cross section will be measured soon in proton - nucleus collisions at hera b at an energy of @xmath80  gev .",
    "the advantage of this experiment is that it covers a larger range of feynman-@xmath7 , especially in the negative @xmath7 region . in this region effects due to the formation time of",
    "the hadron will be less important and the genuine cross sections will be measured .",
