    "the roots of the subject of several complex variables go back to the discovery , a century ago , that in contrast to the 1-dimensional case , there are domains @xmath3 in higher dimensions such that all holomorphic functions on @xmath3 extend holomorphically to a larger domain .",
    "this leads directly to the notion of the envelope of holomorphy .",
    "the _ envelope of holomorphy _ of a complex manifold @xmath0 is a stein manifold @xmath4 with a holomorphic embedding of @xmath0 onto a domain in @xmath4 that induces a bijection between the sets of holomorphic functions on @xmath0 and on @xmath4 .",
    "if it exists , the envelope is uniquely determined up to isomorphism , and the assignment of its envelope to a manifold that has one is functorial . if @xmath0 is a domain in a complex manifold @xmath1 and there is a stein domain @xmath4 in @xmath1 containing @xmath0 to which all holomorphic functions on @xmath0 extend holomorphically , then @xmath4 is the envelope of holomorphy of @xmath0 , and we say that @xmath0 has a _ schlicht _ envelope of holomorphy in @xmath1",
    ".    given a domain @xmath0 in a complex manifold @xmath1 , it is a difficult problem with no general solution to determine whether @xmath0 has a schlicht envelope of holomorphy in @xmath1 , and if it does , to describe the envelope . the purpose of this paper is to tackle the problem with the help of a smooth 1-dimensional foliation @xmath2 of @xmath1 .",
    "the rough idea is to continue the holomorphic functions on @xmath0 along the leaves of @xmath2 ( rather than along arbitrary curves in @xmath1 ) as far away from @xmath0 as possible , and obtain the envelope of holomorphy of @xmath0 as the union of the maximal leaf segments through @xmath0 along which all holomorphic functions on @xmath0 can be continued .",
    "it is natural to require the leaves of @xmath2 to be noncompact , that is , exclude embedded circles as leaves , and to insist that @xmath0 intersect each leaf , which is then an injectively immersed real line , in a nonempty connected set .",
    "namely , as we continue holomorphic functions beyond @xmath0 along leaves of @xmath2 , we do not want to come back to where we have already been . and",
    "if @xmath0 does not intersect every leaf , we might as well replace @xmath1 by the saturation of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath2 .    with these requirements , the rough idea works ,",
    "as long as @xmath2 satisfies a new property that we call _ quasiholomorphicity_. continuation of holomorphic functions on @xmath0 along leaves of @xmath2 produces a locally stein domain @xmath4 in @xmath1 containing @xmath0 to which all holomorphic functions on @xmath0 extend holomorphically . if @xmath1 is stein , so is @xmath4 , so @xmath0 has a schlicht envelope of holomorphy in @xmath1 , about which we have the additional information that it intersects every leaf of @xmath2 in a nonempty connected set .",
    "this result , stated more precisely below as theorem [ trepreau1 ] , can be viewed as a generalization and a global version of a well - known lemma from the mid-1980s ( theorem [ trepreau0 ] below ) that we shall call the schlichtness lemma .",
    "this lemma corresponds to our result with @xmath1 being a box in @xmath5 foliated by straight line segments parallel to one of its edges .",
    "following the proof of our global schlichtness lemma , we illustrate the notion of quasiholomorphicity with sufficient conditions , examples , and counterexamples , and present some applications , in particular to a little - studied boundary regularity property of domains called local schlichtness .",
    "let us summarize the contents of the paper in more detail .",
    "we need a few new definitions .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth 1-dimensional foliation of a complex manifold @xmath1 with no compact leaves .",
    "then the leaves of @xmath2 are injectively immersed lines ( not necessarily embedded ) .",
    "a domain @xmath3 in @xmath1 is called an _ interval domain _ with respect to @xmath2 if @xmath3 has a nonempty connected intersection with each leaf of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a domain in @xmath1 with a connected , but possibly empty , intersection with each leaf of @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath0 is an interval domain in its saturation @xmath6 ( the union of all leaves that intersect @xmath0 ; this is a domain in @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is easily shown that there is a largest interval domain @xmath4 in @xmath6 containing @xmath0 to which all holomorphic functions on @xmath0 extend holomorphically ( see the first paragraph of the proof of theorem [ trepreau1 ] below ) .",
    "we call @xmath2 a _ good foliation _ if @xmath4 is locally stein in @xmath6 for all @xmath0 ( meaning that every boundary point of @xmath4 in @xmath6 has an open neighbourhood @xmath7 in @xmath6 such that @xmath8 is stein ) .",
    "next , we say that @xmath2 is _ quasiholomorphic _ if it satisfies the following two properties :    1 .",
    "if @xmath9 lie in the same leaf , then there is an open neighbourhood @xmath7 of @xmath10 in @xmath1 and a biholomorphism @xmath11 from @xmath7 onto an open neighbourhood of @xmath12 , taking @xmath10 to @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 lies in the leaf of @xmath14 for all @xmath15 ; and 2 .",
    "if @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a point in the leaf of @xmath18 between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then there is a biholomorphism @xmath20 from @xmath7 onto an open neighbourhood of @xmath17 , taking @xmath18 to @xmath17 , such that @xmath21 lies in the leaf of @xmath14 between @xmath14 and @xmath13 for every @xmath15 .",
    "note that quasiholomorphicity is a semilocal property in the sense that @xmath2 is quasiholomorphic if and only if @xmath2 is quasiholomorphic on a saturated open neighbourhood of each of its leaves .",
    "finally , we say that @xmath2 has a _ holomorphic atlas _ if @xmath1 is covered by holomorphic charts that take @xmath2 to the foliation of @xmath5 ( @xmath22 ) by the straight lines along which @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constant . by the rectification theorem for holomorphic vector fields",

    "_    we do not know whether or to what extent the converses of these implications are true ( except in complex dimension 1 , where every smooth 1-dimensional foliation with no compact leaves is good for trivial reasons , but need not be quasiholomorphic , as shown by examples given below ) . as a corollary , we obtain a generalization of the schlichtness lemma .",

    "moreover , @xmath4 is locally stein in @xmath1 .    hence , if @xmath1 is stein , so is @xmath4 , so @xmath4 is the envelope of holomorphy of @xmath0 . in particular , if @xmath1 is stein , then @xmath0 has a schlicht envelope of holomorphy in @xmath1 .",
    "in general , if @xmath1 is not stein , @xmath4 being locally stein does not imply that @xmath4 is the envelope of holomorphy of @xmath0 . however , there are positive results on the levi problem for certain non - stein manifolds , and for such manifolds further conclusions can be drawn from @xmath4 being locally stein .",
    "we call a domain @xmath3 in a complex manifold _ locally schlicht _ at a boundary point @xmath10 if @xmath10 has a basis of connected stein neighbourhoods @xmath7 such that @xmath25 has a schlicht envelope of holomorphy in @xmath7 .",
    "as shown below , it follows from the schlichtness lemma that a domain is locally schlicht at a smooth boundary point . the original motivation for our work was to extend this result to singular boundary points . using the global schlichtness lemma , we are able to prove local schlichtness at well - behaved isolated boundary singularities .    * local schlichtness theorem . *",
