    "since its creation , einstein s general relativity has proved to be a powerful tool used in considering various systems for which relativistic gravitational effects are significant .",
    "it has been used successfully both in describing the cosmological evolution of the early and present universe and in modeling various strongly gravitating compact objects . in the latter case ,",
    "perhaps the most exotic objects predicted by general relativity are black holes and wormholes .",
    "it is commonly believed that such objects might be formed in regions of strong gravitational fields .",
    "the principal feature of any wormhole is the presence of a throat , defined as a two - dimensional hypersurface of minimal area .",
    "this throat can connect either two distant regions of our universe or even different universes , and far from the throat , spacetime may either be flat or have a curved geometry .",
    "a necessary condition to construct a throat is the presence of matter violating the so - called null energy condition  ( nec ) , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is any null vector , and @xmath2 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter . in general , @xmath2 can contain different types of matter , for instance , fluids and/or various fundamental fields . in the simplest case of a perfect isotropic fluid having only one radial pressure , @xmath3 , and the energy density @xmath4 , the nec can be presented in the form @xmath5 .",
    "then , if such a fluid is described by a simple equation of state in the form @xmath6 , a violation of the nec becomes possible when the equation - of - state parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this form of matter is called exotic matter .",
    "it has been used both in describing the present accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite and in constructing such exotic objects as wormholes @xcite .",
    "a quantity of greater interest are models of a traversable lorentzian wormhole , suggested by morris and thorne @xcite ( for a review , see the book by visser @xcite ) .",
    "the traversability assumes that matter and radiation can travel freely through the wormhole which can lead to some interesting observable consequences @xcite .",
    "there are several possibilities to introduce exotic matter .",
    "this can be a consideration of systems with the above - mentioned linear equation of state @xmath6 with @xmath7 @xcite , or the use of ghost / phantom scalar fields @xcite , or a consideration of systems beyond the bounds of einstein gravity @xcite . in any case , to build a model of a static traversable wormhole in general relativity , one has to violate the nec @xcite which requires the use of exotic matter , in one form or another , even if in arbitrarily small quantities @xcite .",
    "here the question arises whether such exotic forms of matter can exist in the universe . a strong argument in favor of such a possibility is the observed accelerated expansion of the present universe .",
    "the numerous attempts to give a theoretical description of the current accelerated expansion of the universe are usually reduced to introducing a new form of matter , called dark energy ( de ) , which is believed to be responsible for such an acceleration . having large negative pressure",
    ", dark energy causes the universe to expand increasingly fast , according to a power law or exponentially . moreover , astronomical observations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and more recent estimates @xcite ) indicate the possibility , that an even more exotic form of energy exists in the universe , called phantom dark energy .",
    "the presence of such an energy assumes the violation of the nec and results in even faster acceleration .",
    "the amount of dark energy is about 70% of the total energy density of the universe",
    ". another important component of the present universe is dark matter ( dm ) which contributes about 25% of the total energy density , and is clustered on scales of the order of galaxies and clusters of galaxies . although the true nature of neither dm nor de is currently known , various ways have been suggested to model them . in the simplest case",
    "this can be the so - called @xmath8cdm model , where de is described by einstein s @xmath8 term , and dm is supposed to be a pressureless fluid ( cold dark matter ) .",
    "however , due to the well - known cosmological constant problem  @xcite , alternative possibilities are being suggested to describe the evolution of the present universe .",
    "one of the approaches to address the origin of de and dm are theories that involve various fundamental fields  @xcite , including cosmological models with de and dm interacting with each other not only gravitationally but also by a direct coupling @xcite ( for a review , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in turn , the supposed presence in the universe of de , in one form or another , and dm provides the basis for concluding that compact systems consisting of dark energy @xcite , of dark matter @xcite , or of interacting de and dm @xcite might also exist .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study compact , spherically symmetric configurations consisting of de and dm nonminimally interacting with each other . in doing so , we model de in the form of a usual ( nonghost ) quintessence - type scalar field , and dm is described as a perfect fluid satisfying the nec . here",
    "our objective will be to construct regular static solutions describing self - consistently a configuration with nontrivial topology , where the violation of the nec is achieved by an appropriate choice of the form of a nonminimal coupling between dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ lagr_choice ] we discuss the choice of the dark matter / dark energy interaction lagrangian , using which we derive the general set of equations for equilibrium configurations in sec .  [ gen_eqns_wh_de_dm ] . in sec .",
    "[ statem_prob ] the statement of the problem is presented , for which in sec .",
    "[ throat_cond ] we find the necessary conditions providing the existence of a throat in the system under consideration . using these conditions , in sec .",
    "[ num_res ] we consider an explicit example of obtaining regular static solutions with nontrivial topology with a particular choice of a nonminimal coupling function .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ conclusion ] our results are summarized .",
    "at the moment , there exists no fundamental theory that allows one to choose a specific coupling in the dark sector .",
    "therefore , any type of coupling will necessarily be phenomenological , although some models may appear to be more physically motivated than others . in modeling de in the form of a scalar field",
    ", one can meet in the literature different types of couplings between the field and dark matter .",
    "this can be the possibility , inspired by scalar - tensor theories of gravity , when one assumes the presence of an interaction of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of dark matter , @xmath11 is the cosmological scalar field , and @xmath12 can be a constant @xcite or be field dependent @xcite .",
    "if one initially works within the framework of general relativity , the appearance of a direct coupling between the scalar field and matter is also possible when the mass of matter particles is assumed to be explicitly dependent on the scalar field .",
    "this can be an exponential dependence ( for cosmological implications , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) or a linear dependence appearing as a consequence of the presence of the yukawa coupling .",
    "the latter type of interaction has been repeatedly considered in the literature . in particular , it was used in studying compact objects in refs .",
    "@xcite , in describing structure formation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in modeling interacting dm and de in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an explicit dependence of the mass of particles on a scalar field implies that by going to a description of matter in the form of a fluid its pressure and density become functions depending explicitly on the scalar field ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "however , one can use instead a phenomenological possibility when a description of the interaction between the scalar field and matter is performed assuming that the pressure and density are not initially explicit functions of a scalar field .",
    "such a coupling can be expressed through an interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the lagrangian of matter ( ordinary or dark ) and the coupling function @xmath15 characterizes the interaction between @xmath11 and the matter .",
    "the case @xmath16 corresponds to the absence of a direct coupling between matter and the scalar field , when the two sources are coupled only via gravity .    in the cosmological context",
    ", the interaction lagrangian was used in modeling the present accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , in describing structure formation @xcite , and when considering compact configurations @xcite . in doing so ,",
    "a choice of the lagrangian @xmath14 is , in general , not unique .",
    "it can be taken as @xmath17 @xcite or @xmath18  @xcite , where @xmath4 and @xmath19 are the energy density and the pressure of an isentropic perfect fluid . by varying both these matter lagrangians with respect to a metric",
    ", one obtains the same energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid in the conventional form .",
    "however , it can be shown that , for instance , for static configurations , these lagrangians will give different equations for an equilibrium configuration ( see , e.g. , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . apparently , at the present time , it is difficult to make a motivated choice among these lagrangians @xmath14 , or any other lagrangians used in the literature ( for the other possible lagrangians and a discussion of their choice for nonminimally coupled systems see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for this reason ,",
    "a description of various systems with nonminimal coupling of the type @xmath20 is made , in effect , using an _ ad hoc _ choice of @xmath14 .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the objective of the present paper is to study the possibility of obtaining solutions describing static configurations with nontrivial topology sourced by a usual ( nonghost ) cosmological scalar field interacting with dark matter both gravitationally and through a direct coupling .",
    "the general lagrangian for such a system can be presented in the form @xmath21 here @xmath11 is the real scalar field with the potential @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the the electromagnetic field tensor , and @xmath24 is the lagrangian of dark matter , where @xmath4 denotes the energy density of dark matter .",
    "the case @xmath25 corresponds to the absence of a direct coupling between dark matter and the scalar field .",
    "however , even in this case the two sources are still coupled via gravity .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be obtained by varying the matter part of the lagrangian with respect to a metric , @xmath26 + \\partial_{i}\\varphi\\partial^{k}\\varphi - f^l_i f^k_l -\\delta_i^k\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\partial_{l}\\varphi\\partial^{l}\\varphi - v(\\varphi)-\\frac{1}{4}f_{lm}f^{lm}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the pressure of a dark matter fluid , and @xmath27 is the four - velocity .    in considering equilibrium wormhole - like configurations",

    "since not all of the einstein field equations are independent because of the conservation of energy and momentum , @xmath54 , the @xmath55 component of this equation gives @xmath56    equations - and must be supplemented by an equation for the scalar field which follows from the lagrangian  , @xmath57= -\\left(\\frac{d",

    "here we consider the conditions under which the system described by the lagrangian may permit the existence of configurations with nontrivial topology . in doing so , we proceed from the following assumptions .",
    "1 .   dark matter , being clustered in a finite region of space , has the boundary at some @xmath60 where its energy density and pressure become equal to zero , @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   at large distances ( @xmath62 )",

    "3 .   at large distances ( @xmath62 )",

    "this in turn implies the positivity of the potential energy @xmath22 .",
    "it is assumed that both the dark matter and the dark energy do not violate the nec .",
    "then , taking into account that at large distances the energy density of the electric and magnetic fields is much smaller than the scalar - field energy density ( see below in sec .",
    "[ num_res ] ) , the resulting lagrangian becomes identical in form to that used in describing the cosmological evolution of the universe . in this sense ,",
    "configurations being studied here may be thought of as embedded in a cosmological background .    to obtain a nontrivial topology in the system under consideration ,",
    "it is necessary to violate the nec in the vicinity of the center . here",
    "we will consider solutions symmetric with respect to the center with the boundary conditions given by eq .",
    "( see below ) .",
    "since , by definition , a throat is a two - dimensional hypersurface of minimal area , then the areal radius @xmath67 must have a minimum at the throat . without loss of generality , we can take this throat to occur at @xmath68 .",
    "then , mathematically , we need to : i ) provide a minimum of the function @xmath69 at the point @xmath68 , and ii )  ensure that @xmath70 is real .",
    "taking into account that the derivative of the scalar field is equal to zero at the throat [ see eq .  ] and the condition ( iv ) , it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ throat_cond ] that the function @xmath67 has a minimum only when @xmath71 in the vicinity of the center .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ lagr_choice ] , at the present time the choice of the function @xmath63 is strictly model dependent , and does not follow from any first principles .",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath63 is everywhere positive , and is chosen in such a way as to be compatible with current astronomical and cosmological observations .",
    "the latter implies , in particular , that @xmath63 gives an adequate description of a nonminimal interaction between dark matter and a scalar field at small energy densities which are typical for cosmology and galactic halos .",
    "on the other hand , at higher energy densities which are typical for inner parts of compact objects , the possibility is not excluded that conditions might occur when @xmath63 becomes negative . in particular",
    ", it may be due to quantum effects which might lead to violations of the nec @xcite .",
    "in any case , this important question requires special consideration , which goes beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we wish only to analyze some general requirements for the appearance of nontrivial topology in the system described by the lagrangian with the proviso that the above conditions ( i)-(iv ) are satisfied .",
    "we note here that in the absence of a nonminimal interaction the literature in the field offers alternative ways to violate the nec only in the vicinity of a throat .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the case was considered where a scalar field ( which can change the sign of the `` kinetic '' term depending on the magnitude of the field ) becomes a ghost near a throat , remaining nonghost everywhere else , as in our case .",
    "taking account of the choice @xmath71 in the vicinity of the center and the condition ( ii ) , the function @xmath63 , as it moves outward from the center of the configuration to large distances , must necessarily go through zero at some point .",
    "since @xmath63 stands in the denominator of eq .",
    ", this certainly implies that @xmath72 also must be equal to zero at that point .",
    "it appears that this condition can not be realized , at least for analytic functions .",
    "one way around this difficulty is to choose an @xmath63 that crosses zero somewhere outside the fluid where eq .",
    "is already absent .",
    "another possibility is to choose a special equation of state for dark matter . in the simplest case",
    "it can be a linear equation of state in the form @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , which is widely used in cosmology . in this case eq .",
    "can be integrated in the form @xmath75 here the index `` _ c _ '' corresponds to central values of the variables at @xmath68 .",
    "assuming that the metric function @xmath29 remains finite and nonzero everywhere , it is seen from this expression that to provide the regularity of @xmath4 along the radius of the system we must take @xmath76 .",
    "the most popular hypothesis in modeling dark matter is the assumption that its equation of state corresponds to cold dust matter @xcite .",
    "such matter is either pressureless or has a very small pressure with the equation - of - state parameter lying in the range @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the pressure can be negative .",
    "on the other hand , when modeling dark matter by a scalar field , it is possible for @xmath78 to be considerably smaller than zero @xcite .",
    "consistent with this , in what follows we will consider the possibility of obtaining a nontrivial topology in our system .",
    "let us now turn to a consideration of boundary conditions for the set of equations - and .",
    "since here we will seek solutions which are symmetric with respect to the center , we choose boundary conditions in the neighborhood of the center of the configuration as @xmath79 where the index `` _ c _ '' corresponds to the central values of the variables at @xmath68 .",

    "it is given by the @xmath44 component of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath144 it contains the contributions from the dark matter energy density @xmath4 , and also from the scalar and electric / magnetic fields .",
    "the numerical calculations show that in considering configurations with sizes of the order of or less than those of galaxies , the contribution from the potential energy @xmath109 is negligibly small on these scales .",
    "the main contribution to the mass comes from the electric and/or magnetic fields ; they determine the size of the throat [ see eqs .   and ] , and correspondingly its mass , and give significant contributions to the energy density in the internal and external regions of the configuration .",
    "the contributions coming from the terms with the dark matter , @xmath145 , and the gradient of the scalar field , @xmath146 , depend on the central energy density @xmath147 and on the parameter @xmath78 whose values determine the fraction of the exotic matter at the center of the configuration .",
    "the amount of the exotic matter in turn affects directly the central value of the scalar field @xmath148 , since the latter is obtained by equating the expression for @xmath63 from eq .   at @xmath149 to the expression for @xmath85 from eq .  .",
    "then , starting from @xmath148 thus obtained , we seek a solution for @xmath64 which goes to the background cosmological value @xmath65 somewhere at @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the numerical calculations indicate that , for the values of the parameters used in this paper , at the point where @xmath64 becomes equal to @xmath65 , the scalar - field energy density @xmath150 is always much larger than the energy density of the electric and/or magnetic fields @xmath151_{\\phi=\\phi_0}$ ] .",
    "this allows one to regard the configurations in question , to a good approximation , as embedded only in an external , homogeneous scalar field @xmath65 .",
    "notice that if we formally extend the solution beyond the point @xmath130 , putting here @xmath150 equal to a positive constant corresponding to the background energy density of dark energy ( the effective @xmath8 term ) , then at some point the metric function @xmath29 inevitably goes to 0 which is a consequence of the fact that these solutions belong to the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter - type solutions .",
    "figures  [ energ_metr]-[sf_coup ] show the results of numerical calculations .",
    "since the solutions under consideration demonstrate a de sitter - like behavior , the metric function @xmath29 reaches a maximum , and then drops to zero at some finite value of @xmath139 . by choosing appropriate values of @xmath152 , which merely corresponds to a redefinition of the time",

    "[ energ_metr]-[sf_coup ] , the dimensionless central value of the dark matter energy density is taken as @xmath137 , and the throat size is @xmath154 [ see eq .  ] . by choosing some characteristic value of the mass of a dark matter particle ,",
    "say @xmath155 , and taking into account the expressions for the dimensionless variables used here , the corresponding dimensional quantities can be presented in the form @xmath156 here @xmath157 is the central mass density of the dark matter . since at the moment",
    "it is not definitely known which type of particles dark matter consists of , various particles with different masses are considered in the literature .",
    "this could be both superlight gravitinos with a mass of the order of @xmath158 and superheavy weakly interacting massive particles with a tev mass scale  @xcite . correspondingly , the dark matter central density and the size of the throat will vary considerably depending on the mass of particles .",
    "the numerical calculations thus show that , for example , if we assume for definiteness that @xmath50 lies in the range @xmath159 used in describing dark matter particles in the form of fermions @xcite , then the solutions presented in figs .",
    "[ energ_metr]-[sf_coup ] remain practically unchanged .",
    "that is , the structure of the configurations under consideration is in essence independent of the mass of dark matter particles , and the dimensionless solutions obtained enable one to describe objects whose physical characteristics , in dimensional units , can be found by a simple rescaling of the variables by using the appropriate dimensional factors from eq .  .",
    "comparing the expression for @xmath98 from eq .   with eq .",
    ", it is seen that the intensity of the electric and/or magnetic fields at the throat , which is inversely proportional to @xmath98 , decreases with decreasing the mass of dark matter particles .",
    "then , for instance , at @xmath160 we have very compact objects with sizes and masses comparable to those of neutron stars , and with the extremely high intensity of the electric and/or magnetic fields at the throat @xmath161 . when @xmath162 , the throat size is comparable to that of quasars @xmath163 , with the corresponding mass @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( cf .",

    "it turns out that for the parameters of the scalar field used here [ see eq .   and",
    "the subsequent paragraph ] , the physical characteristics of the configurations in question are similar to those of magnetic wormholes from ref .",
    "the numerical calculations indicate that in all cases considered here , the boundary of the dark matter fluid is situated near @xmath166 . inside this region",
    ", the contribution coming from the exotic matter may be important .",
    "in particular , this results in the appearance of negative energy densities in the inner regions of the configuration ( see fig .  [ energ_metr ] , the case with @xmath167 ) .",
    "this allows one to reduce the mass of matter in the inner region by choosing the free parameters of the system in such a way as to provide the presence of a larger amount of the exotic matter .",
    "the possibility of making such a choice is due to the form of the quintessence potential @xmath109 which , being shallow enough in the neighborhood of its minimum , permits one to change the value of the background field @xmath65 within quite wide limits while maintaining the necessary background energy density @xmath134 .",
    "this in turn allows one to adjust the central values of the scalar field so as to provide a large amount of the exotic matter in the inner regions of the configuration .",
    "starting from the assumption that dark matter may be nonminimally coupled to dark energy , we have studied spherically symmetric systems with nontrivial topology which is provided by a proper choice of the nonminimal coupling function @xmath108 . as an explicit example , we have considered the particular case where dark energy is modeled by a usual ( nonghost ) scalar field @xmath64 , and dark matter is taken to be a perfect fluid , which satisfies the null energy condition , and is described by the linear equation of state @xmath168 . for this case",
    "we assume that the function @xmath108 may become negative at high matter densities which characterize the inner regions of compact objects , thereby providing conditions for the violation of the nec in the vicinity of the center .",
    "then , by considering some general conditions under which a nontrivial topology might occur in such a system , we have shown that solutions describing traversable wormholes can be obtained only when 1 ) an electric / magnetic charge is present , and 2 ) the equation - of - state parameter @xmath78 is negative .    when these conditions are satisfied , it is possible to construct solutions which may describe configurations embedded in an external quintessence scalar field . in this case",
    "we sought solutions that satisfy the requirements ( i)-(iv ) ( see the beginning of sec .",
    "[ statem_prob ] ) , and showed the following .    1 .   there",
    "exist regular static , spherically symmetric solutions found numerically by solving the coupled einstein - matter equations subject to a set of appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the obtained solutions describe compact mixed dark matter / dark energy configurations consisting of two parts : the internal region from the center up to the radius @xmath60 corresponding to the boundary of the dark matter , where the pressure and density of the dark matter vanish , and the external region ( @xmath129 ) where there remain only the scalar and electric / magnetic fields .",
    "assuming that the effects of the nonminimal coupling are only important at relatively high densities of dark matter , we sought solutions for the scalar field that started from some central value @xmath148 and went to the cosmological background value @xmath65 at @xmath169 . in doing so , we assumed that the nonminimal coupling function @xmath108 from eq .",
    "is always negative up to the boundary of the dark matter fluid where it crosses zero , and then tends to unity as @xmath170 . in this case",
    "the free parameters of the system were adjusted so that at this point the gradient of the scalar field @xmath135 .",
    "this enables the solution for the scalar field to be matched smoothly onto the homogeneous solution @xmath130 .",
    "such configurations may be regarded as embedded in an external , homogeneous cosmological scalar field whose energy density is close to the critical one @xmath171 . in other words , the configurations in question",
    "may be thought of as embedded in the universe described by the quintessence lagrangian with @xmath25 .",
    "3 .   on the scales under consideration",
    ", the potential energy @xmath109 has no substantial influence on the characteristics of the objects under investigation .",
    "this allows us to suppose that the use of other quintessence potentials compatible with observations , instead of that given by eq .",
    ", will give rise to configurations having similar physical parameters .",
    "the configurations considered in the present paper resemble magnetic wormholes from ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a magnetic field plays a key role , and exotic matter can contribute only a small amount .",
    "such exotic matter can be presented as a massless ghost scalar field @xcite , or , equivalently , as dust matter with negative energy density @xcite falling off quite slowly with distance ( an inverse quartic dependence ) .",
    "a distinctive feature of the configurations studied here is that there is a possibility to concentrate the exotic matter around the throat at distances @xmath172 throat radii , and beyond these limits the `` tails '' of the scalar and electric / magnetic fields , satisfying the null energy condition , are only present .",
