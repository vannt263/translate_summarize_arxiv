    "apart from the issue of renormalization , quantization of the general theory of relativity is carried out in much the same way as in the case of ordinary yang - mills theories . besides formalities of the consistent quantization , however , there are questions of principle concerning basic postulates underlying the synthesis of classical theory and quantum - mechanical ideas . the rules of this synthesis are mainly contained in the correspondence principle of n.bohr , which , on the one hand , gives recipe for the construction of operators for physical field quantities , and , on the other hand , implies definite requirements as to the form of these quantities in cases when a system displays classical properties .",
    "establishing the correspondence between the classical and quantum modes of description in the case of the theory of gravity displays features quite different from those encountered in other theories of fundamental interactions .",
    "distinctions arise , in particular , when the limiting procedure of transition from the quantum to classical theory is performed . in theories like quantum electrodynamics , e.g. ,",
    "interaction of two charged particles takes the form of the coulomb law when momentum transfer from one particle to the other becomes small as compared to the particles masses , so the above mentioned procedure is accomplished by tending the masses to infinity . in essential , this constitutes most of what is called the physical renormalization conditions .",
    "the latter require the gauge field propagator ( in the momentum space ) to have the unit residue of the pole at zero momentum , which is just the aforementioned condition on the form of the two - particle interaction in the coordinate representation .    in the case of gravity , however , the situation is essentially different .",
    "there , transition to the classical theory can not be performed by taking the limit : particle mass @xmath2 , because the value of the particle mass determines the strength of its gravitational interactions .",
    "in fact , relative value of the radiative corrections to the classical newton law , corresponding to the logarithmical contribution to the gravitational form factors of the scalar particle , is independent of the scalar particle mass @xcite .",
    "although this trait of the gravitational interaction makes it exceptional among the others , and moreover , is in apparent contradiction with the standard formulation of the correspondence principle , it is not really an inconsistency in the quantum description of gravitation : to get rid of it , one may simply weaken the correspondence principle , and require the relative corrections to the newton law to disappear only at large distances between the particles .",
    "there is , however , a still more important aspect of the correspondence between the classical and quantum pictures of gravitation , that attracts our attention in the present paper .",
    "the einstein theory , being essentially nonlinear , demands the quantum theory to reproduce not only the newtonian form of the particle interaction , but also all the nonlinear corrections predicted by the general relativity . in this respect ,",
    "the above - mentioned peculiarity of the gravitational interaction , namely , its proportionality to the masses of particles , is manifested in the fact ( also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that , along with the true quantum corrections ( i.e. , proportional to the planck constant @xmath3 ) , the loop contributions also contain classical pieces ( i.e. , proportional to @xmath0 ) . thus , an important question arises as to relationship between these classical loop contributions and the classical predictions of the general relativity .",
    "in analogous situation in the yang - mills theories , the correct correspondence between the classical and quantum pictures is guaranteed by the fact that all the radiative corrections to the particle form factors disappear in the limit : masses @xmath4 thus providing the complete reduction of a given quantum picture to the corresponding nonlinear classical solution .",
    "it is claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite that when collected in the course of construction of the gravitational potential from the one - particle - reducible feynman graphs , aforesaid classical contributions just reproduce the post - newtonian terms given by the expansion of the schwarzschild metric in powers of @xmath5 @xmath6 being the gravitational radius .",
    "it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ definition ] that this claim is erroneous : the one - loop terms of the order @xmath0 in the gravitational potential are actually two times larger than the terms of the order @xmath7 coming from the schwarzschild expression .",
    "this in turn raises the question of relevance of the notion of potential in the case of quantum gravity .",
    "it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ extension ] that not only the value of the potential , defined with the help of the two - particle scattering amplitudes , disagrees with the classical results of the general relativity , but also that the potential so constructed fails to describe whatever non - newtonian interaction of _ macroscopic _ bodies .",
    "after that an alternative interpretation of the @xmath0 parts of the loop contributions will be suggested , based on a certain modification of the correspondence principle .",
    "the use of the effective action formalism turns out to be essential for the new interpretation , running thereby into the problem of gauge dependence of the effective action . in sec .",
    "[ zero ] , gauge independence of the @xmath0 part of the one - loop contribution to the gravitational form factors of the scalar particle is proved , thus ensuring the physical sense of our interpretation .",
    "[ tools ] contains brief description of the method used in evaluation of the gauge - dependent parts of the loop corrections .",
    "the results of the work are discussed in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] .",
    "some formulae needed in calculation of the feynman integrals are obtained in the appendix .",
    "we use the highly condensed notations of dewitt @xcite throughout this paper . also left derivatives with respect to anticommuting variables",
    "the dimensional regularization of all divergent quantities is supposed .",
    "before we proceed to actual calculations , it is worthwhile to make some remarks concerning the notion of potential in quantum theory .",
    "let us begin with an obvious but far - reaching observation that a definition of potential in any ( classical or quantum ) field theory must be given in terms characterizing motion of interacting particles , simply because only in this case the definition would be relevant to an experiment .",
    "for this purpose , the scattering matrix approach can be used , in which case the potential is conventionally defined as the fourier transform ( with respect to the momentum transfer from one particle to the other ) of the suitably normalized two - particle scattering amplitude . by itself",
    "this definition is not of great value unless one is able to separate the whole scattering process as follows : interaction of the first particle with the gauge field @xmath8 propagation of the gauge field @xmath8 interaction of the gauge field with the second particle .",
    "only if such a separation is possible can one introduce a self - contained notion of the potential . in terms of the feynman diagrams , one would say in this case that the diagrams describing the scattering process are one - particle - reducible with respect to the gauge field",
    ".    in connection with what just have been said , a question may arise of what the construction of the potential , or some other object based on the above - mentioned separation of the particle interaction , is needed for .",
    "the answer is that only through such a construction can the correspondence between the classical and quantum modes of description be established .",
    "indeed , the very nature of classical conceptions implies existence of a self - contained notion of the field produced by a given source , which value is independent of a specific device chosen to measure it .",
    "an object possessing these properties would be just supplied by the potential defined in the manner outlined above .",
    "definition of the potential through the scattering amplitudes is not the only way to introduce an independent notion of the gauge field .",
    "till now , however , it _ is _ the only _ consistent _ way if one is interested in giving a _ gauge - independent _ definition , i.e. , the one that would give values for the gauge field independent of the choice of gauge conditions needed to fix gauge invariance of the theory . actually , it was recently proposed that , in the case of quantum gravity , such a definition can be given beyond the s - matrix approach through the introduction of classical point particle moving in a given gravitational field and playing the role of a measuring device @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the one - loop effective equations of motion of the point - particle ( the effective geodesic equation ) , calculated in the weak field approximation in the non - relativistic limit , turn out to be independent of the gauge conditions fixing the general covariance @xcite .",
    "although this result , undoubtedly , is of considerable importance on its own , it lies out of the main line of our concern here , since it is based on the introduction of the classical point - particle into the functional integral `` by hands '' , which certainly can not be justified using consistent limiting procedure of transition from the underlying quantum field theory to the classical theory . on the other hand , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , introduction of the classical _ field _ matter ( scalar field ) instead of the point - like still leads to the gauge - dependent values for the gravitational field .",
    "therefore , it seems natural to try to establish the correspondence between the quantum gravity and the classical general relativity just in terms of the potential defined through the scattering amplitudes .",
    "however , it will be shown below that the value of the potential , found in ref .",
    "@xcite , disagrees with the classical result given by the schwarzschild solution .",
    "the latter has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the standard spherical angles , @xmath11 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath12 is the gravitational radius of a spherically - symmetric distribution of mass @xmath13 the form of @xmath14 given by eq .",
    "( [ sch1 ] ) is fixed by the requirements @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 to compare the two results , however , one has to transform eq .",
    "( [ sch1 ] ) to the dewitt gauge @xmath18 used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath19-components of eq .",
    "( [ gauge ] ) are already satisfied by the solution ( [ sch1 ] ) . to meet the remaining condition ,",
    "let us substitute @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a function of @xmath11 only .",
    "then the @xmath19-components of eq .",
    "( [ gauge ] ) are still satisfied , while its @xmath11-component gives the following equation for the function @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24    since we are interested only in the long - distance corrections to the newton law , one may expand @xmath25 in powers of @xmath26 keeping only the first few terms : @xmath27.\\ ] ] substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ rcond ] ) , one obtains successively @xmath28 @xmath29 etc .",
    "therefore , up to terms of the order @xmath30 the schwarzschild solution takes the following form @xmath31 taking the square root of the time component of the metric ( [ sch2 ] ) , we see that the classical gravitational potential turns out to be equal to @xmath32 the post - newtonian correction is here two times smaller than that obtained in @xcite .",
    "thus , we arrive at the puzzling conclusion that in the classical limit , the quantum theory of gravity , being based on the bohr correspondence principle , does not reproduce the einstein theory it originates from .",
    "however , before making such a conclusion , one would question relevance of the notion of the gravitational potential itself .",
    "it may well turn out that this discrepancy arises because of incorrect choice of the quantum - field quantity to be traced back to the classical potential .",
    "that this is very likely so will be demonstrated in the sections below .",
    "as was explained in sec .  [ definition ] , establishing correspondence between the quantum and classical theories of gravitation turns out to be highly nontrivial in view of the fact that the classical contribution to a given process is not contained entirely in the trees , but comes also from the loop diagrams .",
    "it is not even clear what the quantum - theoretical counterpart of the classical potential ( or , more generally , of the classical metric ) is . as we saw in sec .",
    "[ definition ] , the usual definition of the quantum gravitational potential is not in concord with the classical theory .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that our consideration is not restricted to the case of the einstein theory only .",
    "being related to the low - energy phenomena , all the conclusions are valid in any quantum theory of gravity as well , if that theory becomes newtonian in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "there are different ways of thinking in this situation .",
    "one could conclude , for example , that since the quantum gravity does not satisfy the correspondence principle , the basic postulates of the general relativity are incompatible with the principles of quantum theory , and therefore their synthesis is impossible . or , one could try to find another definition of the gravitational potential , that would be in agreement with the classical general relativity , on the one hand , and possessed physical meaning at the quantum level , on the other .",
    "below , a more refined interpretation will be given , based on a certain modification of the correspondence principle .",
    "let us first note that , from the formal point of view , the correspondence between any quantum theory and its classical original is most naturally established in terms of the effective action rather than the s - matrix .",
    "this is because the effective action [ the generating functional of the one - particle - irreducible green functions , @xmath33 defined in eq .",
    "( [ effaction ] ) below ] just coincides with the initial classical action in the tree approximation .",
    "in particular , nonlinearity of the classical theory ( resulting , e.g. , in @xmath26- power corrections to the newton law in the general relativity ) is correctly reproduced by the trees . in the case of quantum gravity , there are still additional contributions of the order @xmath34 coming from the loop corrections .",
    "they are given just by the gravitational form factors of particles , which serve as the building blocks for the gravitational potential .",
    "instead of constructing the potential , however , let us consider them in the framework of the effective action method . from the point of view of this method , the @xmath0-parts of the particle form factors , together with the proper quantum parts of the order @xmath35 describe the radiative corrections to the classical equations of motion of the gravitational field .",
    "it is non - vanishing of these terms that violates the usual bohr correspondence .",
    "there is , however , one essential difference between the @xmath0 loop terms and the nonlinear tree corrections .",
    "consider , for instance , the first post - newtonian correction of the form @xmath36 the `` const '' receives contributions from the tree diagram pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , as well as from the one - loop form factor , fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "if the gravitational field is produced by only one particle of mass @xmath37 then the two contributions are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "they are not , however , if the field is produced by a macroscopic body consisting of a large number @xmath38 of particles with mass @xmath39 being responsible for the nonlinearity of einstein equations , the tree diagram [ fig1](a ) is _ bilinear _ in the energy - momentum tensor @xmath40 of the particles , while the loop diagram [ fig1](b ) is only _ linear _ ( to be precise , it has only two particle operators attached ) .",
    "therefore , when evaluated between @xmath38-particle state , the former is proportional to @xmath41 while the latter  to @xmath42 if , for instance , the solar gravitational field is considered , the quantum correction is suppressed by a factor of the order @xmath43    this fact suggests the following interpretation of the correspondence principle when applied to the case of gravity : _ the effective gravitational field produced by a macroscopic body of mass @xmath44 consisting of @xmath38 particles turns into corresponding classical solution of the einstein equations in the limit @xmath45 @xmath46 _    it is clear from the above discussion that the use of the effective action is essential for this interpretation : the quantum potential , being of the form @xmath47 for a macroscopic ( @xmath38-particle ) body of mass @xmath37 would fail to reproduce classical potential other than newtonian , since @xmath48    thus , the loop corrections of the order @xmath0 are now considered on a equal footing with the tree corrections , and thereby are endowed direct _ physical meaning as describing deviations of the space - time metric from classical solutions of the einstein equations in the case of finite @xmath49 _    like any other argument trying to assign physical meaning to the effective action , the above interpretation immediately runs up against the problem of its gauge dependence . in spite of being independent of the planck constant ,",
    "the @xmath0 terms originating from the loop diagrams are not gauge - independent _ a priori_. however , as will be demonstrated below , there is a strong evidence for that they _ are _ gauge - independent nevertheless .",
