    "quantum phase transitions are a subject of great interest.@xcite in contrast to classical or thermal phase transitions , which occur at a nonzero temperature @xmath1 and are driven by thermal fluctuations , quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature , @xmath2 , as a function of some non - thermal control parameter and are driven by quantum fluctuations . in this paper",
    "we will focus on quantum phase transitions in metallic systems . for reasons discussed below , these transitions are especially interesting .",
    "a prototypical quantum phase transition is the one from a paramagnetic metal to a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "indeed , the earliest theory of a quantum phase transition was the stoner theory of ferromagnetism.@xcite stoner assumed that the conduction electrons are responsible for the ferromagnetism , and developed a mean - field theory that describes both the classical and the quantum ferromagnetic transition . in an important paper , hertz later derived a landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) functional for this transition by considering a simple model of itinerant electrons that interact only via a contact potential in the particle - hole spin - triplet channel.@xcite hertz analyzed this ( dynamical ) lgw functional by means of renormalization - group ( rg ) methods .",
    "he concluded that the critical behavior in the physical dimensions @xmath3 and @xmath4 is mean - field - like .",
    "that is , as far as the static critical exponents of the transition at @xmath2 are concerned , he concluded that stoner theory is exact in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in the mid 1990s",
    "it was realized that the above conclusion is not correct .",
    "the problem is that in metals at @xmath2 there are gapless particle - hole excitations that couple to the magnetic order - parameter fluctuations and influence the quantum critical behavior for all dimensions @xmath5 . in hertz s theory this coupling",
    "is taken into account only in an approximation that does not suffice for yielding the leading critical behavior .",
    "technically , hertz theory treats the fermionic soft modes in a tree approximation , whereas describing their influence on the critical behavior requires taking into account fermionic loops .",
    "physically , a correct description of any phase transition must treat the order parameter fluctuations and all soft modes that couple to them on equal footing .",
    "a theory that takes into account these effects was developed by the present authors and t. vojta . in ref .",
    "it was shown that the quantum phase transition from a metallic paramagnet to an itinerant ferromagnet in the absence of quenched disorder in @xmath3 and @xmath4 is generically discontinuous , or of first order , in contrast to the second - order transition with mean - field critical behavior predicted by hertz theory.@xcite the mechanism behind this phenomenon is analogous to what is known as a fluctuation - induced first - order transition in superconductors and liquid crystals.@xcite there , soft fluctuations of the electromagnetic vector potential ( in superconductors ) or the nematic order parameter ( in liquid crystals ) couple to the order parameter and effectively change the sign of the cubic term in the equation of state , leading to a first - order transition . in the quantum magnetic case ,",
    "the role of the additional soft modes is played by the fermionic particle - hole excitations mentioned above that are massless at @xmath2 . since these modes acquire a mass at @xmath6 , the tendency towards a first - order transition diminishes with increasing temperature .",
    "this leads to a tricritical point at a temperature @xmath7 that separates a line of continuous transitions at @xmath8 from a line of first - order transitions at @xmath9 . in a later paper with rollbhler ,",
    "the effects of a magnetic field @xmath10 were investigated.@xcite it was found that in the space spanned by @xmath11 , @xmath10 , and the control parameter , tricritical wings , or surfaces of first - order transitions , emanate from the tricritical point and terminate in a pair of quantum critical points in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "the wing boundaries at @xmath6 are given by lines of critical points that are reminiscent of a conventional liquid - gas critical point and connect the tricritical point with the quantum critical points at @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting generic phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .    -0 mm ) , magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) , and the control parameter ( @xmath12 ) . shown are the long - range ordered magnetic ( lro ) and paramagnetic ( pm ) phases , lines of second - order transitions , surfaces of first - order transitions ( `` tricritical wings '' ) , the tricritical point ( tcp ) , and the two quantum critical points ( qcp ) .",
    "the long - range order can be of ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic type , and the electrons causing the long - range order can be in the same band as the conduction electrons , or in a different band .",
    "see the text for further explanation.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    this general picture is in good agreement with experimental results for low - curie - temperature metallic ferromagnets , including zrzn@xmath0,@xcite uge@xmath0,@xcite urhge,@xcite and mnsi.@xcite    in this paper we generalize our previous theory in three important ways .",
    "first , we show that our previous results , which had been derived under the same assumption made by stoner and by hertz , namely , that the magnetism is caused only by itinerant electrons , remain valid in metallic systems where the magnetism is caused by electrons in a different band than the conduction electrons .",
    "second , we show that the results are _ not _ restricted to heisenberg ferromagnets , contrary to what was implied in refs .   and .",
    "rather , they apply equally well to metallic xy or ising magnets , since the magnetic moments couple to conduction electrons whose spins have three degrees of freedom .",
    "this is an important point , since some of the relevant materials are strongly anisotropic magnets , including uge@xmath0 ( easy axis ) and urhge ( easy plane ) .",
    "third , we show that the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] also applies to generic metallic ferrimagnets .",
    "ferrimagnets are materials that spontaneously develop both a homogeneous and a staggered magnetization at the same critical value of either the temperature ( for a classical transition ) or a non - thermal control parameter ( for a quantum transition ) .",
    "physically , this can happen when magnetic moments of unequal magnitude on a bipartite lattice align in opposite directions.@xcite    the unifying principle behind these generalizations is the realization that coupling a homogeneous magnetization to conduction electrons will produce the same results irrespective of the microscopic origin of the magetization.@xcite as a result , the phase diagram depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is valid for generic metallic ferromagnets in addition to itinerant ones , for ferromagnets of xy or ising type in addition to heisenberg magnets , and for ferrimagnets as well as for ferromagnets . in all cases",
    "we also consider the effects of nonmagnetic quenched disorder . in ref .",
    "it was shown that this type of disorder leads to an interesting phase diagram with a number of multi - critical points , and that sufficiently strong quenched disorder causes the first - order paramagnetic - to - ferromagnetic transition in metals to become second order .",
    "we will see that the same result holds for metallic ferrimagnets .",
    "experimentally , the effects of disorder on either one of these transitions have not yet been studied systematically .",
    "we now derive the results listed in sec .  [",
    "sec : i ] . to this end",
    "we are interested in a theory that describes the magnetization or order - parameter ( op ) field @xmath13 , the fermionic degrees of freedom described by grassmann - valued fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the coupling between them .",
    "accordingly , the action will have three parts : [ eqs:2.1 ] [ m;| , ] = a_[m ] + _ [ | , ] + _ [ m;| , ]  , [ eq:2.1a ] and the partition function is given by z = d[m]d[| , ] e^-a[m;| , ]  .",
    "[ eq:2.1b ] we are , however , not interested in a complete description of the fermionic degrees of freedom ; rather , we want to restrict ourselves to the fermionic soft modes and integrate out the massive modes in the simplest approximation that respects the symmetries of the problem to arrive at an effective landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory in terms of soft modes only .",
    "if we denote the soft fermionic degrees of freedom collectively by @xmath16 , and the massive ones by @xmath17 , we formally have [ eqs:2.2 ] z = d[m , q ]  e^-a_[m , q ]  , [ eq:2.2a ] where _ [ m , q ] & = & a_[m ] - d[p ]  e^-_[q , p ] + & & e^ - _ [ m;q , p ] + & & a_[m ] + a_[q ] + a_[m , q ]  .",
    "[ eq:2.2b ] as we will see later , the @xmath16 are matrices formed by bilinear products of the fermion fields , @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and the @xmath17 are given by the same products with @xmath20 . here",

    "@xmath27 is defined analogously .",
    "this separation of soft and massive fermionic modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , integrating out @xmath17 in a suitable approximation , and determining the consequences of the coupling between @xmath16 and @xmath13 , is the central objective of this paper . for the separation we will make use of the general theory developed in ref .  .",
    "we are interested in magnetic order , and hence the appropriate order - parameter field is the magnetization @xmath28 .",
    "we write the magnetization as a part @xmath29 whose average is the homogeneous magnetization , and a part @xmath30 whose average is a staggered magnetization , ( x ) = m(x ) + n(x)_j=1^n(k_j )  .",
    "[ eq:2.3 ] here the @xmath31 are @xmath32 wave vectors that characterize the staggered magnetic order , and both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are slowly varying in space and time .",
    "in particular , their fourier expansions contain only wave numbers that are small compared to the norms of the @xmath31 .    in a paramagnetic state the expectation values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both zero . at a transition to a ferromagnetic state the expectation value of @xmath33",
    "becomes nonzero while that of @xmath34 remains zero ; at a transition to an antiferromagnetic state the converse is true .",
    "a ferrimagnetic transition is characterized by both @xmath33 and @xmath34 acquiring a nonzero expectation value at the same point in parameter space . in this sense",
    "there is only one order parameter field for a ferrimagnetic transition ; this fact will be importan later .",
    "for the purposes of the present paper , a crucial question is the coupling of the order - parameter fluctuations to the soft fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "since the soft parts of the latter are soft at zero wave number , the leading coupling is to @xmath33 .",
    "the fermions also couple to @xmath34 , but this leads to subleading effects since the staggered magnetization is soft at a nonzero wave number .",
    "we will neglect this coupling in what follows .",
    "physically , the near - homogeneous magnetization flutuations act as a magnetic field proportional to @xmath33 that couples to the electronic spin density [ eqs:2.4 ] _ ( x ) = _ a , b|_a(x)_ab_b(x )  .",
    "[ eq:2.4a ] here @xmath35 denotes the pauli matrices , and @xmath36 are spin indices .",

    "there is not a single example of a quantum critical point in zero magnetic field . while this is consistent with the generalized mean - field theory theory presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , it is somewhat surprising when compared with the case of liquid crystals , where an analogous theory also predicts a first - order transition . in this case , in stark contrast to that of quantum magnets , the observed transition is usually of second order , and only recently have examples of a ( weakly ) first - order transition been found.@xcite these observations beg the question whether in the case of quantum magnets the generalized mean - field approximation is more generally valid than in classical systems .    to discuss this point , we first observe that we have made three approximations to treat the action given by eq .",

    "these approximations are not independent of one another , and the first two simplifications do not constitute any additional approximation over and above the last one .",

    "the mean - field approximation for the order parameter means that the fermionic degrees of freedom describe an interacting electron system that is spin - polarized by the coupling to the homogeneous magnetization , which acts as an effective external magnetic field .",
    "the state of the fermionic subsystem is thus described by a stable fermi - liquid fixed point . corrections to the fermionic soft - mode action due to massive degrees of freedom are irrelevant with respect to this fixed point by at least one - half power of frequency or wavenumber in all dimensions , and thus can not change the properties of system.@xcite similarly , only the terms quadratic in @xmath16 contribute to the fixed - point action ; all higher - order terms are irrelevant by power counting .",
    "keeping terms of higher order in @xmath16 will therefore renormalize the parameters of the theory , but it can not change its structure . in particular , it can not change the sign of the term in the equation of state , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.27 ] , [ eq:2.28 ] ) , that is due to the soft fermionic fluctuations and leads to the first - order transition .",
    "this leaves the mean - field approximation for the order parameter to be discussed . if the first - order transition at @xmath138 occurs far from the second - order transition at @xmath111 that is pre - empted by it ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , then order - parameter fluctuations are negligible and the results of the generalized mean - field theory are qualitatively correct . if , however , the first - order transition occurs close to the putative second - order one , i.e. , if the minimum in the free energy in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] is very shallow , then it is less clear whether order - parameter fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "one key difference between classical liquid crystals and quantum magnets is that in the former case , the system is below the upper critical dimension @xmath139 for the ( unrealized ) phase transition that would occur in the absence of any coupling between the smectic order parameter and the nematic soft modes .",
    "in contrast , the quantum magnetic systems are above the corresponding upper critical dimension @xmath140 that follows from hertz theory , and even with that coupling taken into account , ordinary mean - field theory becomes exact , as far as the description of the phase transition is concerned , for @xmath141.@xcite this strongly suggests that order - parameter fluctuations are of much less importance in the case of quantum magnets , and it provides a possible explanation of the fact that the observed transition is universally of first order .",
    "irrespective of these observations , the role of order - parameter fluctuations in quantum magnets is a topic that warrants additional work . for the case where the magnetism is not produced by the conduction electrons",
    ", this will require an action that properly describes localized magnetic moments and their fluctuations , e.g. , the one given in ref .  . for itinerant magnets ,",
    "i.e. , if the magnetism is due to the conduction electrons themselves , the theory developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] will apply , but the order - parameter fluctuations and the fermionic excitations both need to be kept , along the lines of the phenomenological theory of ref .  .",

    "it would also be interesting to experimentally study quantum ferromagnets or ferrimagnets in @xmath3 , where order - parameter fluctuations will be stronger than in @xmath4 .",
    "so far we have discussed the case of clean or pure magnets .",
