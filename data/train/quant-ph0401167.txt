    "quantum information is mostly based on use of entanglement , and optimal performances of quantum protocols are obtained when the parties share maximally entangled states . however , entanglement is corrupted by the interaction with the environment , and it becomes crucial to establish whether or not quantum protocols may be exploited for a given level of the environmental noise .",
    "quantum purification consists @xcite in distilling a certain number of maximally entangled states from a larger number of corrupted states , _",
    "i.e. _ to sacrifice some copies of the received state to increase the entanglement of others . entanglement of partially corrupted states is only a necessary conditions for distillation , _ bound entanglement _ being the entanglement that can not be distilled @xcite .",
    "some sufficient criterion for distillability has been proposed , the most relevant being the reduction criterion ( rc ) @xcite , and the norm - related criterions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the rc to a generalized class of depolarized states in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "first we briefly review the distillability criterion and introduce a characteristic polynomial for our class of states .",
    "then we apply our results to @xmath2 bypartite systems and numerically study the distillability .",
    "we consider @xmath3 bipartite systems .",
    "rc for distillability is based on map theory @xcite and states that the negativity of the matrix @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the systems s density operator and @xmath6 is the reduced density operator , implies the distillability of the original density matrix @xmath5 . using rc we will study the distillability of depolarized states of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a generic pure state .",
    "we already considered the schmidt s decomposition of @xmath9 and thus , without loss of generality , the @xmath10 s are supposed to be real numbers , with the additional condition @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the @xmath13 identity matrix .",
    "depolarized maximally entangled state are obtained for @xmath14    to make the rc ( [ red : crit ] ) of some computational use , we have to explicitly write down the @xmath15 dimensional real matrix representing ( [ our : state ] ) . in order to do this",
    "we first find out the fock representation of ( [ red : crit ] ) if @xmath5 is given by ( [ our : state ] ) .",
    "we have : @xmath16 or , in matrix form : @xmath17 where the @xmath18 s are @xmath3 matrices given by @xmath19\\right ) \\qquad \\mathbf{a}_{ij } = - a_i a_j \\mathbb{d}[i , j ] \\qquad \\mathbf{a}_{ji}=\\mathbf{a}_{ij}^{\\mathrm{t } } \\label{aij}\\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath20 . in eqs .",
    "( [ aij ] ) @xmath21 $ ] denotes a matrix which is zero everywhere except for the @xmath22 entry , which is one .",
    "we are now in the position to write the characteristic polynomial @xmath23 of the matrix ( [ matr : red : crit ] ) as a product of two terms @xmath24 where , using the substitution @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 with @xmath27 notice that the eigenvalues given by the second factor in ( [ full : poly ] ) are always positive .",
    "therefore , the sign of @xmath23 is determined by ( [ intr : poly ] ) .",
    "notice also that in ( [ intr : poly ] ) the term @xmath28 is always missing .      as a first application we consider the case @xmath29 , _",
    "e.g. _ when @xmath30 is a maximally entangled state .",
    "the polynomial ( [ intr : poly ] ) reduces to @xmath31 the only relevant eigenvalue is the one given by the last factor of the @xmath32 polynomial , namely @xmath33 that yields the already known condition @xcite @xmath34 for distillability of depolarized maximally entangled states .    as a second check",
    "consider the case of a @xmath35-dimensional maximally entangled state in a @xmath1-dimensional space , _ i.e. _ @xmath36 , @xmath37 while the remaining @xmath38 coefficients @xmath10 are set to zero . in this case",
    "it s not difficult to see that the @xmath1-dimensional @xmath32 polynomial ( [ intr : poly ] ) reduces to the @xmath35-dimensional one @xmath39 the non - trivial root of ( [ max : ent : minus ] ) reads @xmath40 leading to the condition @xmath41 for example , for a @xmath42 system and a state with one zero - coefficient we find that the distillability is assured for @xmath43 .",
    "notice that rc is only a sufficient condition for distillability and therefore the bound in ( [ cond : max : ent : minus ] ) need not to be a lower bound . indeed , for the @xmath42 case considered above the system is also distillable for @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "as a further example we apply this representation to the case of a @xmath2 bipartite system . in this section , since @xmath1 is set to 3 , we rename @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ matr : red : crit ] ) becomes : @xmath46 the polynomial ( [ intr : poly ] ) now reads : @xmath47 with @xmath48 the solutions of ( [ 3x3:poly ] ) are : @xmath49 \\label{sol:3x3:1 } \\\\ x_{\\pm}&=&-p\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{b_{2}^{3}}{3}}\\,\\left\\{\\cos\\left [ \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{b_{2}^{3}}{27\\,b_{3}^{2}}-1 } \\right)\\right]\\right .",

    ", we switch to spherical coordinates , setting @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and plot the minimum value of @xmath51 for which ( [ red : crit ] ) is satisfied , as a function of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . doing this for every eigenvalue ( [ eigenvalues ] ) , we than select the minimum value of @xmath51 between the three , at any given point on the plane @xmath57 .",
    "it turns out that the only contributing eigenvalue is @xmath58 .",
