    "the computation of multi - parton scattering amplitudes in qcd is essential for quantitative predictions of multi - jet cross - sections at high - energy colliders .",
    "the feynman diagrams for such an amplitude can generate a thicket of complicated color algebra , tangled together with expressions composed of kinematic invariants .",
    "an extremely useful way to disentangle the color and kinematic factors is via _ color decompositions _",
    "@xcite in terms of chan - paton factors  @xcite , or traces of @xmath4 matrices in the fundamental representation , @xmath5 .",
    "the traces are multiplied by purely kinematical coefficients , called partial amplitudes or subamplitudes .",
    "originally motivated by the representation of gluon amplitudes in open string theory , such decompositions have been widely studied and applied at both the tree level  @xcite and the loop level  @xcite .",
    "two major advantages of the trace - based color decompositions are that ( a ) subamplitudes are gauge - invariant , and ( b ) an important ` color - ordered ' class of them receive contributions only from diagrams with a particular cyclic ordering of the external partons ; these subamplitudes therefore have much simpler kinematic properties than the full amplitude .",
    "although the standard color decompositions are very effective , in some cases they are not quite optimal .",
    "for example , the decomposition of the purely gluonic tree amplitude is overcomplete .",
    "explicitly , the @xmath6-gluon amplitude is written in terms of @xmath7 single - trace color structures , as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the subamplitudes .",
    "the cyclic invariance of the trace has been used to fix its first entry , and the sum is over the set of non - cyclic permutations of @xmath6 elements , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . however , the @xmath7 subamplitudes appearing in the equation are not all independent . besides cyclic and reflection invariances , which they inherit from the traces ,",
    "subamplitudes also obey a @xmath12 decoupling identity ( also called a dual ward identity , or subcyclic identity )  @xcite , @xmath13 this identity can be derived by setting @xmath14 equal to the unit matrix and collecting terms containing the same trace ; this gives the amplitude for a @xmath12 ` photon ' and @xmath15 @xmath4 gluons , which must vanish .",
    "more general identities can be derived by assigning the @xmath4 generators for the external gluons to commuting subgroups such as @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "kleiss and kuijf found a linear relation between subamplitudes  @xcite ( see ) , which is consistent with all of these identities , and which reduces the number of linearly independent subamplitudes from @xmath7 to @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , the conventional color factors for gluonic feynman diagrams are composed of structure constants @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath12 and generalized decoupling identities are all manifest ; for example , the @xmath12 generator commutes with all other generators , so all structure constants containing it are zero . on the other hand , a particular string of contracted structure constants will not appear _ ab initio _ with a gauge - invariant kinematic coefficient . to pass from the @xmath18-based decomposition to the trace - based decomposition , one substitutes @xmath19 and simplifies and collects the various traces . in the process",
    ", gauge invariance of the partial amplitudes is gained , but properties such as @xmath12 decoupling are no longer manifest .",
    "another disadvantage of trace - based decompositions at tree level is that the color structure of amplitudes in the multi - regge kinematics is obscured  @xcite .",
    "the trace - based decomposition is also not optimal at the loop level . at one loop , the standard color decomposition  @xcite for @xmath6-gluon amplitudes",
    "includes double trace structures , @xmath20 @xmath21 , in addition to single traces of the type that appear at tree level .",
    "the subamplitudes multiplying the single trace structures give the leading contributions in the large @xmath22 limit , and they are color - ordered .",
    "the double - trace subamplitudes , corresponding to subleading - in-@xmath22 contributions , can be written in terms of permutations of the leading ( color - ordered ) subamplitudes  @xcite in a formula reminiscent of the tree - level kleiss - kuijf relation ( see ) .",
    "because the permutation formula is rather complicated , its implementation in a numerical program can be rather slow .",
    "similar formulae hold for one - loop amplitudes with two external quarks and @xmath23 gluons  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new color decomposition for the @xmath6-gluon tree amplitude , in terms of structure constants rather than traces , has been presented  @xcite , whose kinematic coefficients are just color - ordered subamplitudes .",
    "because of this property , the new decomposition retains all the advantages of trace - based decompositions , yet avoids the disadvantages mentioned above . in particular , the tree - level @xmath6-gluon decomposition is automatically given in terms of the @xmath17 independent subamplitudes , in a form that is very convenient for analyzing the high - energy limit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive the new tree - level decomposition in two different ways , and to present similar @xmath18-based color decompositions at one loop , whose kinematic coefficients are again color - ordered subamplitudes .",
    "the leading and subleading - in-@xmath22 contributions combine neatly into one expression in the new decompositions .",
    "also , gluons circulating in the loop are put on the same footing as fermions in the loop .",
    "parton - level cross - sections require amplitude squares or interferences which are summed over all external color labels .",
    "we provide general expressions for color - summed cross - sections in terms of the new color decompositions . in",
    "we give explicit evaluations for quantities encountered in cross - section computations through @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we give two proofs of the new color decomposition for the @xmath6-gluon tree amplitude conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite , and provide accordingly the square of the tree amplitude summed over colors . in we present ( and prove ) new color decompositions for one - loop @xmath6-gluon amplitudes and one - loop amplitudes with an external quark - antiquark pair plus @xmath23 gluons .",
    "in addition , we compute the color - summed interference terms between tree amplitudes and one - loop amplitudes , and the square of one - loop amplitudes , which are relevant respectively for next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculations of jet production rates .",
    "the color - summed interference terms and squares are given in terms of color matrices ; appendix a provides many of those required for jet rate computations up to @xmath24 .",
    "finally , we outline how a new color decomposition for one - loop amplitudes with external photons , gluons and a quark - antiquark pair can be obtained from the amplitudes with only gluons and a @xmath25 pair . in we",
    "summarize our present understanding of the color decomposition of tree - level and one - loop amplitudes , and comment briefly on possible extensions to multi - loop amplitudes .",
    "the new color decomposition for the @xmath6-gluon tree amplitude is . hence our structure constants @xmath18 are larger than the conventional ones by a factor of @xmath26 . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an @xmath4 generator in the adjoint representation .",
    "this color decomposition is analogous to the standard decomposition for the tree amplitude with a quark - antiquark pair and @xmath23 gluons  @xcite , @xmath29 the only difference between the two is the representation used for the color matrices , namely the adjoint representation for the @xmath6-gluon amplitude and the fundamental representation for the amplitude containing a @xmath30 pair .",
    "is written in terms of the @xmath17 subamplitudes where legs @xmath31 and @xmath6 are adjacent .",
    "this is precisely the basis of linearly independent subamplitudes which is singled out by the kleiss - kuijf relation .",

    "we wish to show that the new color decomposition  ( [ gluondecompnew ] ) is equivalent to inserting the kleiss - kuijf relation  ( [ kkequation ] ) into the standard color decomposition  ( [ treegluoncolorold ] ) .",

    "\\label{fpro}\\ ] ] we want to identify all terms that contain a trace of the form @xmath44 because these should give rise to @xmath45 .",

    "the @xmath51 indices on the matrices to the right of @xmath50 must come in reversed order compared to how they appear in the @xmath18 string , but they can appear in that string in any relative order with respect to the @xmath51 that end up to the left of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , for any ordered permutation @xmath52 , the subamplitude @xmath53 appears in the new decomposition  ( [ gluondecompnew ] ) accompanied by the desired trace  ( [ desiredtrace ] ) ; a relative sign of @xmath54 comes from the commutators . collecting all such ordered permutations",
    ", we obtain the kleiss - kuijf formula for @xmath45 , , thus establishing its equivalence to the new color decomposition  ( [ gluondecompnew ] ) .",
    "hence we can derive the new @xmath6-gluon color decomposition via its connection to the kleiss - kuijf relation .",
    "the latter relation was checked up to @xmath55 in ref .",
    "it can be proved for all @xmath6 using the same techniques that were used to prove an analogous one - loop formula  @xcite , below .",
    "consider first the set of color - ordered feynman diagrams with only three - point vertices , which are ` multi - peripheral ' with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath6 , by which we mean that all other external legs connect directly to the line extending from @xmath31 to @xmath6 ; i.e. there are no non - trivial trees branching off of this line .",
    "label the legs on one side of the @xmath31@xmath6 line by @xmath39 , and those on the other side by @xmath56 .",
    "these diagrams contribute to both sides of the kleiss - kuijf relation  ( [ kkequation ] ) in the proper way : there is no relative ordering requirement on the @xmath39 with respect to the @xmath56 on the left - hand side of the relation , and the ordering is summed over on the right - hand side ; the sign factor @xmath57 comes from the antisymmetry of color - ordered three - point vertices ( in feynman gauge ) .    next consider diagrams with non - trivial trees attached to the @xmath31@xmath6 line .",
