    "there have been increasing interests in heteroepitaxial growth of organic semiconductors in relation to the fabrication of thin and deformable microelectronic or optoelectronic devices @xcite . to accomplish a high standard in electrical properties , improvement of the film quality is indispensable , and fundamental researches on growth mechanisms of adsorbed organic molecules",
    "are undertaken @xcite . in an experiment of pentacene ( pn",
    ", c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) growth on si(001 ) @xcite , authors concluded that an organic thin - film growth is similar to the epitaxial growth of inorganic materials , such as the formation of fractal ramified islands like diffusion - limited aggregates ( dla ) @xcite . on the other hand , in an experiment of pn growth on a hydrogen - terminated si(111 ) surface [ h - si(111 ) ] @xcite , a peculiarity is found . on a flat h - si(111 ) surface islands are compact with smooth edges and isotropic , whereas on a vicinal surface islands are dendritic in the step - down orientation while edges in the step - up orientation remain compact : each island has a strong anisotropy in its shape on a vicinal substrate .",
    "island shape anisotropy , however , is not specific to a vicinal surface .",
    "it is observed in the vapor growth of another organic molecule , a behenic acid , even on a flat singular substrate , namely on an oxidized gaas @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we analyze some model systems which lead to shape anisotropy theoretically .    in the heteroepitaxial growth of inorganic materials ,",
    "island shape is mainly controlled by the competition of two processes after an adatom deposition ; an adatom diffusion on a terrace surface and an incorporation kinetics at island edges @xcite . with a fast incorporation at island edges",
    ", diffusion controls the growth and edges undergo a morphological instability to form dendrites . in the extreme case of irreversible solidification",
    "such that an adatom once solidified never detaches again from the island edge , then an island takes a ramified irregular shape with many branches @xcite .",
    "its structure is similar to the dla without a characteristic length , and is called a fractal .",
    "an island is isotropic or symmetric by reflecting the lattice symmetry .    to provide a compact island shape , edge smoothening processes are necessary , such as an edge diffusion or a detachment from the edge .",
    "if the detachment rate is high , adatoms loosely attached to the edge will readily detach and they are hardly incorporated in two - dimensional ( 2d ) islands . then",
    ", the slow incorporation kinetics governs the growth to make islands compact with smooth edges @xcite .",
    "islands may be round at high temperatures or polygonal at low temperatures .    in the heteroepitaxial growth of organic molecules",
    ", one has to take an additional feature into account , i.e. the size of an adsorbed organic molecule .",
    "it can no longer be regarded as a point object as in inorganic cases so far discussed .",
    "both pentacene and behenic acid molecules are flat and elongated in shape .",
    "when they are adsorbed on a substrate , molecules can be normal or lateral to the substrate surface @xcite .",
    "pn molecules are known to grow a wetting film with the molecular long axis normal to the h - si(111 ) surface , namely in a standing - up orientation @xcite .",
    "behenic acid is also known to be in a stand - up orientation but with a small tilting on a substrate .",
    "we assume that this molecular orientation affects the detachment rate of molecules from island edges , and leads to anisotropy in an island shape .    in a previous study@xcite",
    "we proposed a simple lattice gas model , and studied general aspects of the effect of anisotropic detachment on an island shape . in the next ",
    "2 we introduce the model with simulation results of island shapes on a flat substrate .",
    "the model is extended in  3 so as to include the effect of steps explicitly for the case of adsorption on a vicinal substrate .",
    "the last  4 summarizes the result .",
    "when molecules in a 2d crystal stack almost normal to a substrate surface but with a finite tilting , as to the @xmath2-axis in the case of a behenic acid @xcite , kinetics at island edges may depend on relative orientations of the edge and of the molecular tilting . to an edge where the molecular inclination restricts the incorporation space ,",
    "diffusing molecules may be difficult to be attached to the edge , but once attached they may be difficult to be detached from this edge .",
    "depression of the attachment rate slows down the incorporation kinetics , and the edge becomes smooth . on the contrary ,",
    "suppression of detachment increases incorporation and leads to a diffusional instability of a smooth edge .",
    "so far the relation between the molecular tilting and the orientation of dendritic edge is not identified experimentally @xcite , we here assume simply that a molecular tilting affects detachment process such that the detachment rate of a molecule depends on the edge orientation . in our theoretical treatment , we forget about the finite size and shape of an adsorbing organic molecule , but consider it implicitly in the orientation - dependence of the detachment rate .",
    "we perform kinetic monte carlo simulations @xcite of a lattice gas models of point molecules depositing on a square substrate with a deposition rate @xmath3 per area .",
    "adsorbed molecules diffuse on a surface with a diffusion constant @xmath4 .",
    "when two diffusing molecules meet , they make a bond to lower an energy and form a cluster .",
    "clusters enlarge their sizes by incorporating diffusing molecules at edges . on the other hand , molecules at edges can detach from the islands when they are loosely attached : those particles with a single bond to the island can break the bond to migrate out on the substrate surface with a rate @xmath5 , but molecules with more than two bonds",
    "are assumed immobile . when a particle is deposited above an island , it diffuses on the island terrace till it reaches an edge , and steps it down to be incorporated into the island .",
    "evaporation of adsorbed molecules from the surface is excluded , since the growth is assumed to take place at a low temperature . when there is no detachment , grown islands take a ramified dendritic form with irregular fine branches , similar to the dla @xcite . with a small detachment ,",
    "one obtains dendritic aggregates with fat branches , as shown in fig .",
    "here , parameters are @xmath6 and @xmath7 with a system size @xmath8 and the coverage @xmath9 .",
    "although islands interfere with each other in a diffusion field , they have almost a symmetric shape . by applying the box - counting method ,",
    "one obtains a rough estimate of the fractal dimension as @xmath10 .     with a surface diffusion @xmath6 at a coverage @xmath9 .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    we now introduce an anisotropy in the rate of detachment from edges . on the left edge of an island , for instance",
    ", we arbitrary reduce the rate of detachment by @xmath13 .",
    "island morphology simulated by means of kinetic monte carlo simulation @xcite becomes anisotropic , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) .",
    "when the detachment from the left edge is reduced by a factor 10 as @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , the left edges of islands grow faster than those in the other orientations , and the primary branch to the left extends about three times more than to the right .",
    "the fractal dimension by box counting remains the same value @xmath14 . on further reducing the detachment rate from the left edges to @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) , islands point sharply to the left with the left - to - right ratio ranging about 3 to 6 , depending on environment . primary branches extending to the left are fine and have less side - branches , compared to fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , and primary branches to other orientations have many secondary branches extending long to the left .",
    "pointing structure leads to the small fractal dimension of @xmath15 by the box - counting method .",
    "island morphology in fig .",
    "1(c ) looks quite similar to those observed for the behenic acid islands on an oxidized gaas @xcite .    instead of suppressing detachment from the left edge ,",
    "the enhanced detachment from the righ edge leads to anisotropic island shape @xcite . in this case",
    ", however , islands extend vertically in @xmath16 direction , and the obtained shape looks different to what is observed in the experiment @xcite . on increasing the detachment rate @xmath17 , islands become more compact with smooth edges as a skeletal shape or even to a complete square .",
    "the effect of anisotropic detachment in these cases have been discussed previously @xcite .",
    "we know consider the case of a heteroepitaxial growth on a vicinal surface , which might be relevant to pn growth on h - si(111 ) @xcite . on a flat terrace ,",
    "pn molecules form 2d islands , and they are compact with an isotropic shape . therefore , pn molecules might often detach from island edges . on a vicinal h - si(111 )",
    "surface , pn islands show different morphology in the upward and downward directions relative to the substrate steps .",
    "island edges extending to the step - down direction are pointed in a dendritic form , while those to the step - up directions remain to be smooth and round .        since pn is known to grow in a standing - up orientation @xcite , an interaction between pn molecules is stronger than that between pn and the substrate .",
    "let us now imagine that a pn crystalline film is growing on a vicinal surface with a positive slope , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . when a film grows to the left in a step - down direction and reaches an upper side of the descending step , as a left island in fig .",
    "2 , further crystal growth takes place by incorporating a pn molecule from the lower terrace . in this case , the whole length of a newly attached molecule interacts with the island edge and the step ledge , and it is hard to be detached back to the lower terrace .",
    "also , the free upper part of the long molecule may in general be susceptible to thermal fluctuation , and there may be a substantial entropy contribution which reduces the bonding free energy .",
    "attachment from the lower terrace may lessen this entropy contribution and enhances the pn - pn bonding .",
    "thus , the detachment rate from the lower terrace is diminished from the normal rate @xmath5 on a flat terrace by a factor @xmath18 as to @xmath19 . on the contrary , when the island grows to the right in the step - up direction and reaches the lower side of the ascending step , as a right island in fig .",
    "2 , the next pn molecule to be incorporated is located on the higher terrace , and its upper part does not contribute to the pn - pn bonding .",
    "since the substrate step has a height of about one fourth of the length of a pn molecule , a loss in the bonding energy may be significant .",
    "accordingly , those molecules incorporated into an island edge from the higher terrace are easily detached back to the higher terrace with an enhancement factor @xmath20 .",
    "we now study the effect of this anisotropic detachment with rate modification factors @xmath21 and @xmath13 on the island morphology .    in kinetic monte carlo simulation of heteroepitaxial growth on a vicinal surface ,",
    "steps are separated with a distance @xmath22 .",
    "after a deposition , molecules perform @xmath23 times of diffusive migrations until a monolayer is covered , but during this period molecules collide to form clusters .",

    "a mark `` h '' represents the high hill - top with a strong correlation , and a mark `` l '' represents the low valley with a weak correlation . from fig.6(b ) one clearly observes that the pattern has a strong periodicity with a period @xmath52 at a surface diffusion @xmath53 . with a smaller diffusion @xmath38 , average island density gets higher as in fig .",

    "so far , we discussed an extreme case with the step separation @xmath37 in order to realize a strong anisotropic effect in our small system .",
    "since the island shape anisotropy is expected to be caused by an accumulation of many weak anisotropy effect at steps , one has to pack as many steps in an island as possible .",
    "actually , with @xmath32 we can observe similar arrangement of many anisotropic islands , but with a larger separation @xmath57 , it becomes harder to observe anisotropy in islands . in a real system of pn molecules , step separations are wider , 4.5 nm to 10 nm , but an island size is about 10@xmath58 m and it spans many steps .",
    "it may be interesting if there is a critical size for an island to show a shape anisotropy .",
    "motivated by heteroepitaxial growth experiments of long organic molecules on a flat @xcite or on a vicinal surface @xcite , effect of detachment anisotropy on the island shape is studied by means of kinetic monte carlo simulations of a lattice gas model .    only with a molecular deposition followed by a surface diffusion ,",
    "islands take a ramified dendritic shape , similar to dla .",
    "addition of detachment from the edge makes fat dendritic branches , and with a large enough detachment rate islands become compact in a square form .",
    "if the long molecules are tilted in an epitaxial film , the rate of detachment from island edges may depend on the edge orientation .",
    "simulation shows that the edge with a smaller rate of detachment shows diffusional instability and forms a dendritic tip .",
    "resulting island shape looks similar to the one obtained in the experiment @xcite .    on a vicinal surface , an interaction between an edge molecule and a neighboring one depends on edge position .",
    "when an edge has just climbed up the substrate step , a molecular bonding is weak and an edge molecule may easily detach from the edge site . on the other hand , when an edge has just stepped down the substrate step ,",
    "a bonding is strong and the edge molecule is hard to detach . in our simulation",
    "we assume an extreme case of no detachment at a lower edge to stress an anisotropy effect .",
    "simulations show clear anisotropy in adsorbed island shape as the step density increases .",
    "in addition to the shape anisotropy of a single island , the orientation - dependent detachment rate may induce a spatial correlation in the arrangement of islands with clear peaks in the spatial correlation function .",
    "since the random deposition process introduces shot noise in the nucleation process , a fast surface diffusion seems necessary to average out fluctuation and to induce a spatial order , but then the island separation becomes large .",
    "for further studies on spatial correlation , one needs a larger system size .    as for the reason of island shape anisotropy",
    ", one may think about a diffusional anisotropy , such that a step provides an asymmetry in an energy barrier for the admolecule diffusion .",
    "however , the asymmetric potential is unable to lead unidirectional motion nor a net drift , as the feynman s ratchet and pawl machine can not provoke directional rotation @xcite .",
    "another effect that steps may provide is a nucleation center by lowering the energy barrier .",
    "but in the experiment there is no observation of alignment of nucleation centers along the step direction .",
    "therefore , the latter effect might be small .",
    "observation of admolecule motion on the substrate , if possible , should resolve these points clearly .",
