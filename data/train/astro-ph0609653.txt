    "hs  1136 + 6646 ( hereafter hs  1136 ) is a hot young dao white dwarf plus k7v secondary star , in a close detached binary .",
    "the discovery from the hamburg schmidt survey was reported in heber , dreizler , & hagen ( 1996 ) .",
    "sing et al .",
    "( 2004 ) determined parameters for the individual components and found an orbital period of 0.83607 days .",
    "radial velocity measurements of both components were used to determine masses of 0.85@xmath3 and 0.37m@xmath3 for the primary and secondary , respectively ( sing 2005 ) . the white dwarf parameters ",
    "t@xmath4 @xmath570,000  k and @xmath6 @xmath57.75  could only be coarsely estimated , due to the dependence of the parameters determined from fitting the balmer lines on the heavy element abundances .    moreover , the optically - derived temperature was difficult to reconcile with the far - uv spectrum of the lyman line region . the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "spectrum shows the presence of o  vi absorption lines and a spectral energy distribution whose slope persists nearly to the lyman limit , suggesting that the balmer line t@xmath4 estimate is too low .",
    "fits to the lyman lines by good et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indicate a far higher value of 120,000  k  among the highest determinations for a dao white dwarf  with @xmath6 of 6.5 .",
    "these parameters suggest that the system could have left the common envelope even more recently than the sing et al .",
    "( 2004 ) estimate of 7.7@xmath710@xmath8 years .",
    "indications are that the secondary star may be overluminous compared to a main sequence star of its mass , still bloated or out of thermal equilibrium from the common envelope phase .",
    "the secondary is irradiated by strong uv radiation causing strong variations in the strengths of the emission lines vs. orbital phase .",
    "be ursae majoris ( ferguson et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) is a similar close dao+k binary also showing a strong orbitally - modulated , `` reflection effect . ''",
    "again , only coarse estimates of t@xmath4 and @xmath6 were given by the above authors , suggesting that the primary star could be similar to that of hs  1136 .",
    "an additional property of the be  uma system is the presence of a large planetary nebula of low surface brightness ( liebert et al.1995 ) . as part of a program by the second author of that paper to look for ancient planetary nebulae ( tweedy & kwitter 1994 ) ,",
    "a 50 arc minute field around be  uma was imaged in h@xmath0 6563 , [ o  iii ] 5007 , and [ n  ii ] 6584 .",
    "the [ n  ii ] observation yielded a nondetection , the [ o  iii ] a marginal one , but the h@xmath0 image revealed the very faint nebula , centered on the binary system , of about a 5 arc minute diameter .",
    "this led us to try a similar observation of hs  1136 , to see if the systems were similar in yet another property . in section 2",
    "we report that no nebula was detected .",
    "instead , we made a different discovery , discussed in section 3 .",
    "_ 90prime _ is a wide field imager , mounted at the prime focus of the steward observatory 2.3-m bok reflector ( williams et al .",
    "the detector is a mosaic of four thinned lockheed 4096@xmath74096 pixel ccds .",
    "the f/2.98 system provides a plate scale of 0.45@xmath9/pixel .",
    "we centered the binary star on chip-1 , the cosmetically best chip having no bad columns .",
    "the resulting image through an h@xmath0 filter is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "scattered light in the upper left of the figure is from a 6th magnitude star , 3 draconis , 25 northeast of hs  1136 .",
    "this complicates the potential detection of faint nebulosity . in any case , no evidence of nebulosity is seen . because of the complication , we did not try to estimate a sensitivity limit above which a nebula is not present .",
    "one feature with this camera at prime focus is a continual need to monitor the instrument focus .",
    "when checking for this after the observations with isophotal contour plots , it became apparent to us that the target star appeared elongated at a position angle of 60 ( or 240 ) degrees from due north ( figure  2a ) , while several stars of similar magnitude in the field appeared almostly perfectly circular ( one of them is shown in figure  2b ) .",
    "this strongly suggested to us that hs  1136 was not a point source , but either would turn out to be a barely - resolved source or a partially - resolved blend of two or more sources . in figure  3",
    "is shown the radial profiles for hs  1136 ( solid points ) vs. those for four comparison stars .",
    "that hs  1136 is more extended than the others is indisputable .",
    "the result was not due to the instrument being out of focus .",
    "however , the seeing at this time from extracting the point spread functions was @xmath51.6 ",
    " see figure  3 .",
    "had we discovered a very compact nebula in h@xmath0 around this unusual binary , instead of an old nebula ?",
    "a logical test was to try a very short exposure in broad - band @xmath10 , a wavelength range in which only weak nebular emission could be anticipated .",
    "we did this observation ( not shown here ) , but the hs  1136 psf again showed extension , the comparison stars did not .",
    "some other explanation besides nebular emission had to be sought .",
    "the field is covered by the sloan digital sky survey ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 , york et al .",
    "2000 , stoughton et al 2002 ) . if one downloads the color image from the dr5 finding chart tool ( figure  4 ) , the presence of a fainter companion to hs  1136 at the same orientation as indicated by fig .",
    "2a is apparent .",
    "this image shows that the companion is much redder than the optical light of the close binary , the latter dominated by the very hot primary .",
    "as we will show later , visual inspection of other sdss stellar sources suggests strongly that the companion is of k or m spectral type .    the acquisition image taken for the previously - published spectrum with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) _ instrument on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "is shown in figure  5 .",
    "the usno - b1 ( monet et al . 2003 ) position of hs  1136 is @xmath11 = 11:39:05.570 , + 66:30:17.75 .",
    "the wide companion is separated by @xmath12 = 1.349  at @xmath13 = 54.391@xmath1 , or at position 11:39:05.945 , + 66:30:18.45 .",
    "since the _ stis _ imaging used the broad - band clear imaging 50ccd mode , the band pass encompasses a wavelength range from 2000  to past 1@xmath12 , though the sensitivity peaks around the @xmath14,@xmath10 and @xmath15 bands . the relatively brightness or count ratio of hs  1136ab to the resolved companion is 5.5:1 ( nearly 2 magnitudes ) .",
    "the measured proper motion from the usno - b catalog is 3.23  in 50 years at a position angle of 248.2 degrees , the wide companion to the close binary is not resolved .",
    "if we assume that the resolved companion is an unrelated field star with negligible proper motion , the two stars are presently moving apart .",
    "if we consider the poss  i fields ( epoch 1954.1 ) , the red and blue images are symmetrical and coincident with no evidence of an offset , even though the proper motion difference between hs  1136 and a stationary companion would have resulted in a 1.9  separation on the opposite side of hs  1136 .",
    "however , the effective image size at the palomar ochsen schmidt scale of 67/mm is several times this separation .",
    "thus , the companion has not been demonstrated to share a common proper motion .    estimating the 3.84 years of proper motion between the sdss and stis acq images for the close binary and the resolved component",
    ", shows each has moved around 0.25  in roughly similar directions ( close binary : @xmath12 = 0.23  / 3.84 yr , @xmath13 = 239@xmath16 ; resolved component : @xmath12 = 0.26  / 3.84 yr , @xmath13 = 288@xmath16 ) .",
    "note that what we call the resolved component is close , but not technically resolved by the rayleigh criteria in the @xmath2 band image , complicating its proper motion calculation .",
    "we have retrieved the sdss @xmath17",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath2 magnitudes corresponding to the image of hs1136 + 6646 using the explore tool in sky server .",
    "the resolved component is virtually undetected in @xmath17 , but is nearly resolved in the @xmath2 band image .",
    "sky server has separated the two components into the close binary sdss j113905.78 + 663017.8 and the resolved component sdss j113905.98 + 663018.3 .",
    "point spread function ( psf ) photometry from the sdss website lists @xmath17 = 13.298@xmath21 0.014 , @xmath19 = 13.914@xmath21 0.03 , @xmath20 = 14.084@xmath21 0.08 , and @xmath2 = 14.159@xmath21 0.034 for the close binary and @xmath17 = 18 @xmath216 , r = 16.12@xmath210.31 , i = 14.457@xmath210.048 , and @xmath2 = 14.052@xmath210.028 for the resolved component .",
    "the @xmath18 band flux is saturated and therefore not used .",
    "the @xmath2 band flux from the close binary and resolved component can be estimated by convolving a synthetic spectrum of the white dwarf ( sing 2005 ) with the z band filter and applying the photometric corrections of holberg & bergeron ( 2006 ) .",
    "we find that the white dwarf `` a '' component has an estimated @xmath2 magnitude of 15.2 while the binary companion `` b '' is 14.7 .",
    "unfortunately , the separate psf magnitudes other than @xmath2 are unreliable .",
    "this is illustrated by the colors of the resolved component ( @xmath22 = 1.659 and @xmath23 = 0.432 ) which do not give main sequence colors .",
    "the @xmath2 magnitudes of the two main sequence stars are observed to be similar and should therefore both contribute to the overall flux of hs1136 + 6646 in the spectroscopic and photometric observations reported by sing et al .",
    "these authors showed that the secondary star in hs1136 + 6646 ( which we now know is a composite of two stars ) was consistent with a k7 v from the optical down to the infrared .",
    "the two main sequence stars , with similar @xmath2 magnitudes , would therefore have to be of similar k spectral type to give these consistent colors across the wide spectral range .",
    "analyzing the photometry of the 50ccd image can provide further hints as to the spectral type of the hs  1136c component .",
    "we convolved the clear band pass of the 50ccd image with the observed spectral energy distributions of ( 1 ) the white dwarf primary , ( 2 ) a k7  v close binary with @xmath2=14.7 , and ( 3 ) a resolved g - m component with @xmath2=14.025",
    ". a synthetic brightness ratio of hs  1136ab to hs1136c was then calculated for different resolved companion spectral types and compared with the observed 5.5:1 ratio .",
    "we find a k4  v or k5  v is most consistent for hs  1136c giving ratios of 5.3:1 and 5.8:1 respectively , while g or m types are ruled out with a g5  v giving a ratio of 3.3:1 while a m3  v gives 12.9:1 .",
    "even a k3  v with a ratio of 4.7 or a k7  v with 7.0 are unlikely matches . with the main sequence stars having similar magnitudes , type , and proper motion , it would seem likely that hs1136 + 6646 is a triple star system ,",
    "although further studies will be needed for a definitive proof .",
    "note that tokovinin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found via adaptive optics observations that 13 of 62 solar - type spectroscopic binaries have tertiary companions .",
    "similar observations of hs  1136ab and its neighbor with an ao system should be sufficient to establish more accurately the color and likely spectral type of the latter , and establish whether its magnitude is consistent with it being a companion at similar distance .",
    "we failed to detect any diffuse nebula surrounding the young post - ce system hs  1136 .",
    "we did , however , uncover evidence of an apparent third component contributing to the optical light .",
    "it is prsently unclear if this component , easily resolved in the _ hst _ acquisition image , is an unrelated field star or a common proper motion companion making a hierarchial triple system .",
    "evidence indicates that it is likely of k spectral type .",
    "regardless , ground - based spectroscopic and photometric studies of this systems need to take into account the presence of the additional star .",
