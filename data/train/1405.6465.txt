    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like particle by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , weighing about 125gev@xmath1 @xcite , quite positively indicates that the higgs mechanism is at work to bring in electroweak symmetry breaking , thus providing mass to the elementary particles . while one of the parameters , namely the mass of the new particle , is somewhat precisely determined in different detection channels , and by two independent experiments , one need to go a long way before establishing the full identity of this particle , in terms of its couplings to other particles , as well as in terms of its constitution . at the same time , the reasons to look beyond the sm will not be diminished , even if the new resonance has all the properties as expected within the sm .",
    "for example , concerning the higgs sector , one will still need to cure the quadratically divergent quantum corrections to the mass of the standard higgs boson .",
    "the other reasons include , existence of the dark matter , the existence of neutrino masses , baryon asymmetry , etc , which clearly indicates the need to look beyond the sm . indeed",
    ", the newly discovered particle , with the understanding of its properties will provide the much needed handle in the search beyond the sm . with the limitations of a hadronic machine",
    ", the lhc may not be able to exhaustively study the properties of the new resonance .",
    "on the other hand , the clean environment of the proposed international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , which is an @xmath2 collider , will help carry out precision experiments on elementary particles and establish their properties , including that of the purported higgs boson , which here we shall denote by @xmath3 .",
    "the possibility of beam polarization could significantly enhance the sensitivity of ilc in general , and also to probe beyond the sm signals  @xcite .",
    "the process that is of interest to us in this work is : @xmath4 this process is , by definition , key to the measurement of the top quark yukawa coupling to the higgs .",
    "the feynman diagrams , at tree level , corresponding to this process are given in fig .",
    "[ fdiag ] .",
    "this include the higgs - strahlung process ( with @xmath5 coupling ) , the contribution of which to the total cross section is about 5% .     in standard model .",

    "@xcite and references therein for some early work on this topic .",
    "more recently , the process has attracted renewed attention in refs .",
    "@xcite , which present a detailed analysis of the background involved and the feasibility of ilc to measure the top yukawa coupling , concluding that the ilc at 800 gev center of mass energy is best suited for such measurement .",
    "the issue of threshold corrections due to @xmath0 bound state effects , more relevant at center of mass(c.m . ) energy close to 500gev , are considered in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also carried out detailed and sophisticated analysis , including considerations of the signal and backgrounds in various channels , with the help of prototype ilc event generators , and making use of the beam polarization . restricted within the sm",
    ", these studies have established that the top quark yukawa coupling could be measured with an accuracy of about 10% .",
    "the direct measurement of the coupling , using the semi - leptonic decays of the @xmath6 s coming from the top quarks is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which concludes that the accuracy of the determination of the coupling is about 30% .",
    "the guiding relation between the limit with which yukawa coupling ( @xmath7 ) can be measured , and that of the cross section ( @xmath8)is @xcite , @xmath9 where , @xmath10 is considered as a variable , and @xmath11 is the top yukawa coupling for the model under consideration , which is to be evaluated at top mass , @xmath12 gev .",
    "it may be noted that , while @xmath13 depends on the details of the experimental efficiency of isolating the signal over the background , apart from detection efficiencies relevant to the final states involved , the pre - factor , @xmath14 depends crucially on how the cross section depends on @xmath10 .",
    "it is easily imagined in a beyond - the - sm ( bsm ) scenario with multiple higgs fields participating in electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , to have the functional dependence of the cross section on the yukawa coupling different from that in the sm @xcite .",
    "for example , cases with cp - mixed higgs bosons will have a @xmath15 coupling with different lorentz structure than that of the sm , which can complicate the dependence . _ a priori _ , it is not clear what kind of differences are expected in the prefactor in the presence of anomalous couplings , compared to the sm case .",
    "neither is it clear , if the signal significance remains the same in both cases .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to attempt to answer this question , without getting into the detailed analysis .",
    "while , it has been reported by the lhc collaborations , that the new resonance is very likely a scalar , the spin and parity studies so far are very limited . investigating the case of a scalar - pseudoscalar admixture should involve a different strategy that what has been adopted so far .",
    "most of the multi - higgs models , including the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , and the minimal , and next - to minimal superpsymmetric standard models ( mssm and nmssm ) are some of the popular extensions of the sm with cp - odd as well as cp - even scalar particles in their cp - conserving versions .",
    "inclusion of cp violation in the higgs sector of such models allow cp - mixed physical scalars .",
    "phenomenology of such possibility has been considered in the literature @xcite . in a recent study  @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out that the ilc is an ideal setting to probe the cp nature of the higgs boson in the process considered here .",
    "it is clear that the scalar and pseudo - scalar parts of a cp - mixed higgs boson will couple differently to different polarization combinations of the top quark and top antiquark .",
    "suitable observables involving top quark polarization , such as polarization asymmetry , could therefore probe the cp - nature of the higgs boson through this process . with the combined use of total cross section , its energy dependence , the polarization asymmetry of the top quark , and the up - down asymmetry of the antitop with respect to the top quark - electron plane , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the cp properties can be efficiently probed through the same process of @xmath15 production at ilc .",
    "the other process being scrutinized to investigate the cp nature of the higgs is @xmath16 , with the higgs boson decaying to @xmath17 lepton pairs  @xcite . a general case of model independent effective anomalous couplings",
    "is studied by ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our recent work  @xcite",
    ", we have studied the possibility of fingerprinting the departure from the cp - even case in decay distributions of the process in eq.([ourprocess ] ) . in this study , two definite scenarios , which we denote as model",
    "i and model ii , have been considered .",
    "model i corresponds to the minimal extension of the sm with one additional pseudo - scalar degree of freedom , which mixes with the sm scalar to form the physical higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "this model is characterized by one free parameter , and the @xmath0 coupling to scalar and pseudo scalar are related by a sum rule that the sum of the squares of the couplings is the same as that of the square of the sm coupling .",
    "similarly , the @xmath5 coupling is scaled by the same parameter that scales the scalar coupling to @xmath0 , as the gauge bosons do not couple to pseudo scalars at tree level .",
    "model ii is a more realistic case , similar to the cp - violating 2hdm model , which has some essential features that make it quite different from model i. in particular , there is no theoretical constraint ( sum rule ) on the parameters , and the scaling of the @xmath5 coupling is not necessarily scaled by the same parameter that scales the scalar coupling to @xmath0 , which is true in general in multi - higgs models with more than one higgs field transforming non - trivially under @xmath18 . confining ourselves to some reasonable ranges of these parameters guided by the experimental indications that the new resonance is close to a cp - even case , we considered the effect of cp - violating higgs boson in the decay spectrum of both the top quark as well as the higgs boson itself , noting that the decay distributions are the spin analyzers of the parent particle .",
    "in view of the remarks above , it is a natural extension of this work to understand the impact of such cp - indefinite higgs boson on the top quark yukawa coupling measurement . in the present work",
    "we address this issue . in order to perform numerical analysis ,",
    "we have used the integrated monte - carlo and event generation package whizard  @xcite , which incorporates the sm , as well as some of its popular extensions .",
    "further , whizard also allows to incorporate any new model described by a lagrangian , through an interface @xcite generated using feynrules  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for our analysis , we have considered a suitably modified version of the model including the anomalous @xmath19 coupling as prescribed by model i and model ii mentioned above .",
    "the scheme of this paper is as follows . in section  [ formalism ]",
    "we first introduce and describe the basic structure of an indefinite cp higgs sector in the two scenarios mentioned above . in section  [ process ]",
    "we describe the processes we consider . in section  [ numresults ]",
    "we present the results of our analysis . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we present a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "after the discovery of higgs boson studying its properties in much detail is the foremost task which will further establish higgs symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "the standard model contains one higgs doublet which by acquiring vacuum expectation value ( vev ) results in a cp - even physical scalar field .",
    "the heaviness of the top quark makes it possible to study the fermion - higgs interactions at the production level , augmenting to the possibilities through the fermionic decay channels . in sm the strength of yukawa couplings to fermions at tree level",
    "is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21gev is the vacuum expectation value and @xmath22 is the mass of fermion . for a top quark of mass @xmath23gev ,",
    "the yukawa coupling is given by @xmath24 .",
    "qcd and weak corrections to this coupling are estimated to be about 10% .",
    "while this is so , there are compelling reasons to look beyond the sm , as indicated in the introduction . many of the scenarios proposed to go beyond the sm have more complex higgs sector , offering possibilities of more than one physical higgs bosons . in the cp - conserving scenarios , some of these are scalar particles , and some are pseudoscalar particles , while in the cp - violating cases , the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing could result in cp - indefinite higgs bosons .",
    "for example , in one of the minimal extensions of the higgs sector beyond the sm , an additional @xmath18 doublet field is introduced in the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , resulting in five physical higgs bosons , one of which is cp - odd neutral particle . in such multi - higgs scenarios ,",
    "the yukawa coupling is in general expected to be different from that of the sm case .",
    "while in the cp - conserving cases , there could maximally be a scaling of the yukawa coupling , compared to its sm value , in the cp - violating cases , there is a different lorentz structure involved in the coupling .",
    "such a cp - indefinite state will also couple differently to the gauge bosons . concerning the present study , we shall focus on the @xmath25 production at ilc , relevant to which , both the @xmath26 as well as @xmath5 couplings take a form , which may be parametrized as follows  @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 here , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the weinberg angle . in the sm with only one scalar higgs boson ( @xmath30 )",
    ", the parameters take values @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in specific models ,",
    "all these parameters may not be independent . in the following",
    "we will describe two simple scenarios that are phenomenologically viable , and can be linked to some of the popular extensions of the sm .",
    "one of the most simple and straightforward extensions of the higgs sector of the sm to incorporate cp violation is to imagine the presence of an additional pseudoscalar degree of freedom ( @xmath34 ) , which mixes with the scalar degree of freedom to produce a physical states :    @xmath35    considering @xmath3 as the 125 gev resonance could be imagined to be heavy , and therore does not interfere with the phenomenology at the energy scales we consider . ] , being under investigation here , the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 above are identified as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which are now constrained by @xmath40 since the sm gauge boson , @xmath41 does not couple to the pseudo - scalar degree of freedom , we have @xmath42 in this scenario .",
    "the down - type quarks as well as the charged leptons will also have the same coupling structure as that of the up - type quarks , so that , for example , the @xmath37-quark coupling becomes @xmath43 in the following , we call this scenario as model i. the advantage here is that there is only one additional parameter to deal with , making it very friendly to perfom phenomenological investigations .",
    "the disadvantage is that , most of the realistic extensions of the sm with multi - higgs scenarios have more complex higgs sector , which do not support the above constraint .      in more realistic extentions of the sm",
    ", the higgs sector allows a more relaxed assignment of the parameter values compared to the scenario in model i above .    in a completely model independent approach",
    "we can treat parameters @xmath44 to be independent of each other .",
    "some specific cases of this scenario , are the 2hdm and mssm with cp violation where there are two higgs doublet fields , leading to two neutral scalar bosons and one neutral pseudoscalar boson which could mix with each other .",
    "thus the physical mass eigenstates are given as : @xmath45   \\phi_2\\\\[1 mm ] a\\end{array}\\right)= { \\cal o}_{3\\times 3}~ \\left(\\begin{array}{c}h_1\\\\[1 mm ] h_2\\\\[1 mm ] h_3\\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the scalar gauge eigenstates , and @xmath34 is the pseudoscalar gauge eigenstate @xcite .",
    "this , in effect , removes the restricting relations between the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for ready reference",
    "we take the example of mssm case ( or 2hdm ) with cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "the couplings of the higgs boson with the fermions and the gauge bosons , where @xmath50 is the ratio of the vev s of the two higgs fields are given by : @xmath51 where we have introduced the subscripts @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 to denote the up - type and down - type quarks , respectively .",
    "the mixing matrix elements satisfy the normalization conditions : @xmath54    we call this scenario as model ii in the rest of this article .",
    "the lightest of the higgs bosons , @xmath55 could be assumed to be the discovered 125 gev resonance ( denoted as @xmath3 ) , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 are considered to be heavy enough to be out of lhc s range investigated so far .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it will be a little premature to make conclusions regarding the cp properties of the new resonance from the lhc results so far .",
    "it can accomodate some amount of sclar - pseudoscalar mixing within specific models like 2hdm , mssm , and nmssm with cp - violating higgs sector .",
    "however , the amount of mixing in these models are highly constrained mainly by the results from flavour sector , as well as the atomic edm measurements @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it is possible to have large values for the parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath37 even when the cp - odd component of the physical higgs boson is small @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we do not intend to consider any specific model , as the viability of such models , and restrictions on their parameters depend on many constraints outside the considerations of the higgs sector itself .",
    "instead , we will take a model independent approach , letting the relevant parameters ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath49 ) rather free , but at the same time keeping them within a small range , without any further justification .",
    "we call this scenario as model ii in the rest of this article .    in the following sections , we will analyze the effect of the anomalous couplings , employed through the scenarios presented above , in the top quark yukawa coupling measurements .",
    "the process under scrutiny is the associated production of higgs boson with @xmath58 pair in @xmath59 collision . as explicitly shown in the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fdiag ] , this process proceeds through higgs radiation off the top quarks , or through the higgs - strahlung off the z boson . assuming the @xmath60 couplings to be standard , the process receive contributions from new physics through the anomalous couplings , @xmath19 and @xmath5 . keeping in focus the main goal of this study , namely , understanding the role of anomalous @xmath19 and @xmath5 couplings in the determination of top quark yukawa couplings , we will follow the analysis strategy adopted in the proposed top quark yukawa measurements , as in refs .",
    "the strategy there was to use eq .",
    "[ eq : delta_g ] to determine the sensitivity of the coupling .",
    "it involves determination of two quantities :    \\(i ) the prefactor , @xmath61 , is determined from the slope of @xmath8 vs. @xmath10 curve . the cross section , @xmath62 when the contribution of higgs - strahlung off the z boson is neglected , leading to prefactor value of 1/2 .",
    "the inclusion of the higgs - strahlung modifies this by about 4% to 0.52  @xcite . in general , the prefactor is determined by the functional dependence of the cross section on the yukawa coupling .",
    "\\(ii ) the other factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : delta_g ] , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of signal events , and @xmath65 is the number of background events . getting the best ( smallest ) value for @xmath66 , is a matter of experimental efficiency , and suitable choice of observables at hand to reduce the background over the signal .",
    "we will first assume that the strategy adopted by ref .",
    "@xcite to reduce the background , and enhance the signal significance through the kinematic cuts on suitable variables considered therein are acceptable as it is even in the presence of anomalous couplings .",
    "further , we will consider various kinematic distributions comparing the case of sm and the case of anomalous couplings with the parameters assuming different values .",
    "such a comparison is expected to indicate if the above assumptions regarding signal significance is realistic or not .",
    "this is important , as a detailed study of the signal and background , event reconstruction , machine and detector efficiency specific to ilc , etc , ar beyond the scope of this study , and therefore not attempted .",
    "rather , we will be satisfied with a qualitative analysis of the various distributions of the signal with anomalous couplings .    considering the signal process",
    ", we first discuss the different final states possible through different decay channels of @xmath19 .",

    "we consider the @xmath71 channel alone .",
    "this leaves the following distinct final states , depending on the decay chanel of @xmath6 :    * pure hadronic mode : in this mode both the w s decay hadronically ( br=45.6% ) , resulting in 4 jets + 4b s in the final state .",

    "we have also assumed that @xmath37-tagging can be performed with high efficiency , and thus @xmath37-jets are distinguished from the lighter quark jets . in our further discussion",
    "we include the hadronic and semileptonic modes , leaving out the purely leptonic channel , owing to its very small br , and two missing particles in the final state .",
    "this is the strategy followed in other studies of top quark yukawa coupling measurement through the same process .",
    "coming to the background , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with pair of @xmath37-jets coming from @xmath41 and @xmath78,contribute to the irreducible backgrounds in the corresponding cases . owing to the large cross section , the @xmath0 pair production could also give rise to the background , through event misconstuction .",
    "we will now turn to our numerical studies in the next section .",
    "for our numerical study , we considered the event generator , whizard  @xcite , with the model files suitably modified to accommodate the anomalous couplings being studied , viz , @xmath79 and @xmath80 couplings , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 , parametrized through eq .",

    "<S> we consider the issue of the top quark yukawa coupling measurement in a model independent and general case with the inclusion of cp - violation in the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> arguably the best process to study this coupling is the associated production of higgs boson along with a @xmath0 pair in a machine like the international linear collider ( ilc ) . </S>",
    "<S> while detailed analyses of the sensitivity of the measurement assuming a standard model ( sm ) - like coupling are available in the context of ilc , conclude that the coupling could be pinned down at about 10% level with modest luminosity , our investigations show that the scenario could be different in case of a more general coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the modified lorentz structure resulting in a changed functional dependence of the cross section on the coupling , along with the difference in the cross section itself leads to considerable deviation in the sensitivity . our studies with an ilc of center of mass energies of 500 gev , 800 gev and 1000 </S>",
    "<S> gev show that moderate cp - mixing in the higgs sector could change the sensitivity to about 20% , while it could be worsened to 75% in cases which could accommodate more dramatic changes in the coupling . while detailed considerations of the decay distributions point to a need for a relook at the analysis strategy followed for the case of sm such as for a model independent analysis of the top quark yukawa coupling measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this study strongly suggests that , a joint analysis of the cp properties and the yukawa coupling measurement would be the way forward at the ilc and that caution must be excercised in the measurement of the yukawa couplings and the conclusions drawn from it .    </S>",
