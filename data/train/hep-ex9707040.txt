    "since the discovery of the internal structure of hadrons and their subsequent association with quarks , the next natural question to be asked is whether these point  like particles have any substructure .",
    "measuring the inclusive jet cross section and studying the angular distribution in dijet events at the tevatron , currently the highest energy hadron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at a center  of  mass energy of 1.8 tev , explores matter at the smallest distance scales available .",
    "both collider detector experiments at the tevatron , cdf and d , have measured these distributions to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and to search for structure on the scale of @xmath1 cm .",
    "the inclusive jet cross section is defined as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bin width in transverse energy , @xmath0 , @xmath4 is the pseudorapidity range covered by the measurement ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the number of jets in the bin , and @xmath7 is the integrated luminosity . for cdf ,",
    "the rapidity interval covers @xmath8 while d  accepts jets in the region @xmath9 .",
    "both experiments correct the raw distributions for detector effects and remove background . in the case of cdf , the raw distribution is corrected for energy response and resolution using a detailed fragmentation model coupled with detector response from single particles@xcite .",
    "the response corrections are typically @xmath10 over the whole @xmath0 range .",
    "the resolution correction is @xmath11 at the lowest @xmath0 ( @xmath12 gev @xmath13 gev ) , flattening out at @xmath10 at moderate @xmath0 s ( @xmath14 gev ) and increasing to @xmath15 for @xmath16 gev .",
    "d  corrects for response on a jet  by  jet basis using a correction derived using transverse momentum conservation in jet  jet and photon  jet events@xcite .",
    "the correction factors range from @xmath17 at low @xmath0 s to @xmath18 at the highest @xmath0 s .",
    "the detector resolution effects are removed by an unsmearing procedure where an ansatz function , smeared with measured detector resolution factors , is fitted to the raw distribution . comparing the smeared and unsmeared distributions",
    "yields a correction factor@xcite .",
    "this correction ranges from @xmath19 at low @xmath0 flattening out at @xmath20 above 100 gev .",
    "cdf has previously measured the inclusive jet cross section using 19 pb@xmath21 from the 1992 - 93 run at the tevatron@xcite .",
    "these data demonstrate good agreement with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd predictions below 250 gev but showed an excess above this .",
    "the higher statistics available from the 1994 - 95 run exhibit a similar excess .",
    "figure [ fig : cdf inc ] shows both data sets compared to nlo qcd produced by the eks program@xcite using cteq3 m parton    distribution functions@xcite with the renormalization and factorization scales ( @xmath22 ) set equal to the @xmath0 of each jet divided by two . although the systematic errors for the 1994 - 95 run are still being determined , they are expected to be of the same magnitude as was found on the 1992 - 93 data .",
    "the results from d  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0 inc ] . in this case",
    "the data are compared with nlo qcd from the jetrad program@xcite with @xmath23 , the @xmath0 of the highest @xmath0 jet in each event , again using the cteq3 m parton distribution function .",
    "the statistical errors are indicated on each point with the systematic error indicated by the band .",
    "the @xmath24 luminosity uncertainty is not included .",
    "the nlo qcd predictions are in very good agreement with the data over the entire @xmath0 range .",
    "the difficulty in comparing the cdf and d  results in figs . [ fig : cdf inc ] and [ fig : d0 inc ] arises due to the many different choices available when comparing to theory .",
    "figure [ fig : inc theory ] illustrates the dependence of the    theory predictions to some of these choices . aside from the obvious multiplicative factors",
    "typically used to scale the choice of @xmath22 which can result in @xmath25 shift in the theoretical prediction , choosing @xmath0 of the individual jets or the maximum @xmath0 in each event as the scale can result in a @xmath26 shift .",
    "choices in parton distribution functions , some of which allow for a significant increase in the production of large @xmath0 jets@xcite , can result in @xmath27 effects .",
    "although both experiments use a cone algorithm with a radius , @xmath28 , of 0.7 , cdf uses the standard snowmass parameters@xcite . in this case ,",
    "two partons can be separated by as much as twice the cone radius , @xmath29 .",
    "d , on the other hand , sets @xmath30 to better match jet clustering effects observed in the d  data .",
    "qualitative comparisons of the two measurements are in good agreement ; a more quantitative analysis is underway .",
    "although the inclusive jet cross section is one way to search for quark substructure , the measurement suffers from sensitivity to the input parton distribution function choice .",
    "an alternative to this approach that is less sensitive to this problem is to measure the angular distribution of the two leading jets in dijet events .",
    "this measurement is analogous to the original rutherford scattering experiments from the turn of the century .",
    "evidence of substructure will manifest itself as distributions which are more isotropic than those expected from the interaction of point  like quarks .    to look for quark compositeness",
    ", comparisons will be made between the data and qcd predictions incorporating compositeness models . to date , nlo qcd predictions including compositeness are not available .",
    "therefore , the    effects@xcite are determined at lo , comparing predictions with and without such features . the nlo theory",
    "is then scaled by the ratio of the two lo theories .",
    "the measurement will be made in terms of the variable @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the pseudorapidities of the two leading jets and @xmath34 is the center  of  mass scattering angle .",
    "this has the virtue of flattening the angular distributions making comparisons to theory easier .",
    "figure [ fig : d0 dijet ] shows the dijet angular distributions from d  for four different mass bins .",
    "statistical errors bars are included on the individual points and the systematic error is indicated by the bands .",
    "the data is compared with nlo qcd predictions from jetrad using two different @xmath22    scales , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "since the angular distribution predictions are sensitive to the choice of scale , any compositeness limit will have to take this into account .",
    "in addition , the extended @xmath31 range available at d  also allows some discrimination between lo and nlo theoretical predictions .    finally , to search for compositeness",
    "we define a variable @xmath37 , @xmath38 this compares the number of events in a region where compositeness effects should be minimal to a region where they should be enhanced .",
    "the measurements are made in mass bins with @xmath39 for cdf and 4 for d . by comparing the measured ratio to various qcd compositeness predictions ,",
