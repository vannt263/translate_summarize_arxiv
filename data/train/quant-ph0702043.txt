    "one of the most interesting phenomena in quantum physics is the ability of quantum system to create information , for instance , in measurement @xcite of electron spins for an epr - pair .",
    "this property is actively used in different areas of quantum physics and its applications , like quantum key distribution .",
    "states of quantum system with such peculiarity are known as entangled states . recently a lot of entangled states have been studied and there exists an urgent problem of classification of all the set of entangled states .",
    "subject of the talk deals with the idea of the invariance of entangled states relative to transformations from a group of symmetry @xcite .",
    "each state of quantum system is invariant relative to phase coefficient thus composite system is to be invariant relative to transformations from the group of symmetry of each subsystem .",
    "these groups form the group of symmetry of the whole system so the set of all states of the system can be clasified through irreducible representations of that group .    in this work",
    "it is shown that almost each space of irreducible representation consists of the entangled states only .",
    "entropy of substates from each space with nontrivial representation exceeds entropy of whole state .",
    "excess of entropy of a subsystem over entropy of the whole system indicates the system is entagled .",
    "let the system @xmath0 has two parts @xmath1 and @xmath2 and is prepared in common state @xmath3 .",
    "of course each part is in its own state : part @xmath1 is in the state @xmath4 and part @xmath2 is in the state @xmath5 .",
    "they can be combined to @xmath6 in different ways :    1 .",
    "if @xmath7 , parts of the system are indepent .",
    "2 .   if @xmath8 , the system is a mixture of its parts .",
    "all the other states of the system are entangled .",
    "common example of entangled state is the epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) one which is a singlet state of electron pair . in accordance with the principle of identity",
    "this state is a linear superposition of states `` spin - up  spin - down '' and `` spin - down  spin - up '' @xmath9 another example is schrdinger cat state being a linear superposition of a photon pair with same polarisations @xmath10      schrdinger cat state shows special type of unitary symmetry .",
    "first we denote as @xmath11 and @xmath12 transformed basis of subsystem @xmath1 : @xmath13 if basis of subsystem @xmath2 is transformed to @xmath14 and @xmath15 by @xmath16 schrdinger cat remains non - transformed @xmath17 thus , the schrdinger cat state has group of symmetry @xmath18  group of unitary transformations of two - dimensional space of states .",
    "similarly , epr - state has the same group of symmetry .",
    "systems having larger subsystems can have entangled states with larger group of symmetry @xmath19 but each such group includes @xmath18 as subgroup , so    _ invariance to group @xmath18 is essential property of entangled state . _      now we describe the state of a part of the system ( or system as a whole ) . under supposition that space of states has finite dimension",
    "we describe a state by density matrix @xmath20 as a result of finite dimension we have the solution of eigenvalue problem for the density matrix . in the case if basis is composed of eigenvectors of density matrix , @xmath21 , we can describe the density matrix as polynomial function @xmath22 of momentum operator @xmath23=2\\hat{s}_z .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] now we involve into consideration associate ladder operators @xmath24 because arbitrary operator on space of states has representation as polynom over ladder operators @xmath25 more exactly each space of subsystem states , as well as the space of states of whole system , is unitarily equivalent to space of irreducible representation of angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "space of states of the system is direct multiplication @xmath27 of subsystem spaces @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    even if subsystems are identical and have unitarily equivalent spaces @xmath30 , the common space of states is @xmath31 . generally ,",
    "dimension of the space of the system states @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "it is significant that system space can be fibred by means of group of symmetry of subsystem @xmath34 into direct sum of irreducible representations of that group .",
    "dimension of each irreducible representation takes values up to the sum of subspace dimensions , not the product of those .",
    "now we denote as @xmath35 and @xmath36 momentum operators for subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "so , we can define set of irreducible representations @xmath37 by rule of addition of angular momentum .",
    "let @xmath38 , thus subspaces @xmath39 contain the irreducible multiplets .",
    "now we suppose that we have representative set of measured values reflecting various properties of system and of both of its parts , and we are going to determine if the system is entangled or not .",
    "first we examine the set as to its adequacy for full determination of state of each subsystem .",
    "state of the system is determined under conditions that all components @xmath40 of density matrix are given , thus set of measured values is to be large enough for calculation of all the components .",
    "process of measurement takes place as count by set of independent detectors .",
    "independence implies that each time only one detector counts .",
    "completeness and purity of detectors is essential as well .",
    "purity implies that projection of a state of the system on each detected state is one - dimensional ; independence  that these projections are orthogonal , and completeness  that these projections give resolution of identity .    in terms of a detector operator @xmath41 : independence and purity @xmath42 ; completeness @xmath43 .",
    "set of measured values is a set of probabilities for each detector @xmath44 we can assign to each detector an observable value @xmath45 and so we define an observable through its decomposition @xmath46    different sets of observable values define various observables forming a class of commutable observables .",
    "typical example is @xmath47 given by eq .",
    "( [ def_z ] ) .      any class of commutable observables can be represented as polynomial of typical element of the class .",
    "we can represent each such example by power of ladder operators @xmath48 as sum or difference @xmath49 or as @xmath50 .",
    "thus we can describe all sets of observables by two sequences @xmath51 or by real and imaginary parts of the sequence @xmath52 .    since each class of commutable observables",
    "is represented by a polynomial function there exist @xmath53 observables @xmath54 with matrix elements @xmath55 .",
    "the values of those observables @xmath56 for a given state @xmath57 depend on coefficients of density matrix and lead to a linear system of equations for these coefficients @xmath58      interrelation between both parts of the system brings up correlations of measured values .",
    "we suppose that each count of detector measuring subsystem @xmath1 is accompanied by a count of some detector measuring subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "we can interprete each pair of detectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 as a composite detector @xmath61 with number @xmath62 being a function @xmath63 of numbers of detectors of parts .",
    "hence we can describe the composite system by its set of sequences of counts and obtain its density matrix    @xmath64      another way to describe a composite system is to supplement independent describtions of each part with account of correlation between observables of different parts .    correlation has description by covariance matrix with coefficients obtained as estimation of mutual sampling rate limit @xmath65 here we have coefficients of covariance matrix of observables from different parts only .",
    "such coefficients for observables from one part are not measurable because arise from different series of measurements .",
    "thus counts @xmath66 and @xmath67 belong to one common series , each coefficient of covariance matrix eq .",
    "( [ cova ] ) originates from its own series and complete measurement of correlation between two parts of given system needs a complete set of @xmath68 measurement series .      for a given state of two - part system covariance matrix",
    "is determined by average value of common observable @xmath69 being the product of corresponding observables of each part @xmath70      \\left[\\hat{s}^{\\left\\{2\\right\\}}_{m}-{\\left\\langle \\hat{s}^{\\left\\{2\\right\\}}_{m}\\right\\rangle}\\right ]      \\right\\rangle}.\\ ] ]      description of states of composite system can be performed in composite basis @xmath71 , as eq .",
    "( [ def_comp ] ) , and in the basis @xmath72 of direct product of the subsystem states as well .",
    "relationship between those bases is similar to the relationship between the basis of total angular momentum @xmath73 and the direct product of the bases of orbital angular momentum and spin @xmath74 .",
    "there exists a set of well - known rules of correspondence between states of total angular momentum and states of combinations of orbital momentum and spin @xmath75 where @xmath76 are clebsch",
    " gordan coefficients .",
    "in general case we have similar rules of correspondence for composition of two parts with momenta @xmath77 and @xmath78 given by @xmath79      invariance of states of composite system under group @xmath34 transformation is realised through diagonalization of density matrix on basis of irreducible representations .",
    "therefore we have representation of density matrix as @xmath80 using decomposition of irreducible states by pure states of subsystems we have representation of the density matrix of whole system as combination of density matrices of subsystems    @xmath81 @xmath82 main result of this decomposition is in representation of density matrices of subsystems obtaned by averaging by states of another subsystem @xmath83 we see that each irreducible part of density matrix of composite system has its own term in density matrices of subsystems and all these parts are diagonal because of special properties of clebsch  gordan coefficients .",
    "each pure state of whole system being irreducible representation has its own density matrices of each subsystem @xmath84 @xmath85 we denote    @xmath86    and obtain diagonal representation of density matrices of each subsystem for each pure irreducible state of whole system @xmath87 almost each one of pure irreducible states of whole system consists of more than one product of states of subsystems like complete angular momentum of electron @xmath88 formed by two orbital substates with orbital momenta @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "only two extreme states with momenta @xmath91 are formed as products of orbital and spin states and only two extreme states with @xmath92 are states of independent subsystems .",
    "density matrices eq .",
    "( [ sub_rho ] ) are diagonal in common basis so density matrix of any part for whole mixed system eq .",
    "( [ def_comp ] ) is diagonal as well : @xmath93 @xmath94 diagonal elements of these density matrices are    @xmath95    @xmath96    they are equal only in the case of same dimensions of state spaces of both parts .    observables @xmath97 , @xmath47 and @xmath98 are measurable jointly , so joint probabilities of their measurement exist .",
    "information that can be obtained in measurement of a system is given by shannon entropy and is limited from above by von neumann entropy : @xmath99 while the space of system states has finite dimensionality , basis diagonalizing density matrix always exists .",
    "thus it is not needed to distinguish between shannon and von neumann entropies .",
    "the basis @xmath100 is composed of eigenvectors of density matrix @xmath101 and gives probabilities @xmath102 as averages @xmath103 of detectors @xmath104 .",
    "existence of group of symmetry of each subsystem of given system leads to fibering of space of states of the whole system to direct sum of subspaces containing irreducible representations of the group .",
    "in addition density matrix of the given system must be diagonal in respective basis @xmath105 thus von neumann entropy of whole system is equal to shannon entropy .",
    "@xmath106      for pure system with density matrix @xmath107 states of each subsystem eq .",
    "( [ sub_rho ] ) are mixed and have equal entropies given by @xmath108 to this expression the name of entropy of entanglement is given in @xcite since it has the meaning of entropy produced by disentangling of entangled system .",
    "values of entropy of both subsystems are equal even if spaces of subsystems have different dimensions .",
    "now we can obtain the entropies for each of subsystems of given mixed system by means of diagonal coefficients eq .",
    "( [ sub_diaga ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ sub_diagb ] ) of respective density matrices @xmath109 substitution of elements of density matrices leads to @xmath110 with account of inequality @xmath111 we obtain inequalities giving the lower bounds of entropies of subsystems @xmath112 similarly , entropy of each subsystem has as its lower bound the entropy of whole system @xmath113 upper bounds of entropies of subsystems result from the finite dimensionalities of spaces of states of subsystems and are equal to @xmath114 .      difference between density matrix of the whole system and direct product of density matrices of its subsystems leads to difference between entropy of whole system and sum of entropies of the subsystems .",
    "process of measurement of the subsystems , of one or both , divides the system into two parts , thus entropy of system turns to sum of entropies of the subsystems .",
    "the sum is always larger than initial entropy so process of measurement of any part of a composite system produces entropy of the system .",
    "resulting entropy of the subsystem remains smaller than the entropy of whole system or equal to it if the system is mixed . only in the case of whole system or its part",
    "being entangled resulting entropy exceeds entropy of the whole system .",
    "thus , excess of entropy of a subsystem over entropy of the whole system indicates the presence of entaglement in the system .",
