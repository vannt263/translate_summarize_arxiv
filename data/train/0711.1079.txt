    "the stable proton - rich nuclei with charge number z@xmath634 are called @xmath4 nuclei @xcite .",
    "the natural isotopic abundance of these nuclei is @xmath7 times less than the more neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "most @xmath4 nuclei can not be produced by neutron capture because they are separated by unstable short - lived nuclei from the @xmath8 or @xmath9 process path .",
    "it is generally accepted that the main stellar mechanism synthesizing these nuclei  the so - called @xmath4 process  is initiated by ( @xmath1,n ) photodisintegration reactions on preexisting more neutron - rich seed nuclei .",
    "as the neutron separation energy increases along this path towards more neutron deficient isotopes , ( @xmath1,p ) and ( @xmath1,@xmath10 ) reactions become stronger and process the material towards lower masses @xcite .",
    "despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts in recent years , there are still open questions about the nature of the @xmath4 process and the synthesis of the @xmath4 isotopes .",
    "the high intensity energetic photons necessary for these @xmath1-induced reactions are available only in scenarios with temperatures around 2 - 3 gk .",
    "one possible site for such a scenario is the o - ne layer of a massive star in hydrostatic pre - supernova burning or explosive burning due to the type ii supernova shockwave .",
    "other potential sites providing the necessary conditions for @xmath4 process nucleosynthesis have been summarized recently @xcite .",
    "one of the main uncertainties in @xmath4 process nucleosynthesis is associated with the origin of the light mo , ru , in , and sn p - nuclei with a fairly large abundance which can not be explained in the framework of standard @xmath4 process nucleosynthesis models .",
    "it has been argued that the @xmath4 process might be complemented by other nucleosynthesis processes such as the @xmath11 process for the light @xmath4 nuclei ( a@xmath12100 ) @xcite or the neutrino induced @xmath13 process in type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "additional possibilities are discussed in @xcite .",
    "modeling the synthesis of the @xmath4 nuclei and calculating their abundances require an extended reaction network calculation involving more than 10000 reactions on 2000 stable and unstable nuclei .",
    "most of the reaction rates are calculated by using the hauser - feshbach statistical model .",
    "the rates of the @xmath1-induced reactions can be determined experimentally by measuring the inverse reaction cross section and converting the results by using the detailed balance theorem .",
    "in contrast to neutron - capture reactions which are comparatively well studied over the relevant mass region of the stable isotopes , charged particle induced reactions at energies below the coulomb barrier are only scarcely studied for the mass region above iron .",
    "previous @xcite and recent @xcite investigations agree on the fact that ( @xmath1,@xmath10 ) reactions are mainly important at higher masses while ( @xmath1,p ) reactions are more important for the lighter @xmath4 nuclei . in recent years",
    "a range of ( @xmath10,@xmath1 ) reaction cross sections on @xmath0ge , @xmath14ru , @xmath15cd , @xmath16sn , and @xmath17sm have been measured , and the results have been compared with model predictions @xcite .",
    "in general the models were able to reproduce the experimental data within a factor of two ; in some cases , however , larger deviations have been observed .    beside these studies ,",
    "numerous ( p,@xmath1 ) experiments have been performed on stable @xmath4 nuclei to determine the reaction rates of the corresponding ( @xmath1,p ) reactions @xcite .",
    "these proton capture studies have shown better agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions than in the case of alpha capture reactions discussed above . however , the existing experimental database is not sufficient for a global check of the reliability of model calculations ; further experimental data are clearly needed @xcite .    as will be further elaborated in the discussion section of this paper , ( p , n )",
    "reactions generally are better suited to study the impact of the optical potential used for protons .",
    "while uncertainties in both the proton and @xmath1 widths impact the cross section prediction in the experimentally accessible energy range of capture reactions , the theoretical uncertainties in ( p , n ) reactions are dominated by the proton width alone .",
    "thus , ( p , n ) studies allow global testing of the proton potential whereas ( p,@xmath1 ) ones directly study astrophysically important reactions .",
    "moreover , it was demonstrated recently that ( p , n ) reactions on @xmath8 or @xmath9 process seed nuclei do affect the abundances of the light @xmath4 nuclei @xcite . there is only limited experimental information available about the low energy cross sections of critical ( p , n ) reactions in this mass range .",
    "this is demonstrated in the case of @xmath18as(p , n)@xmath18se , where the existing data @xcite show considerable discrepancies which makes a direct comparison with hauser feshbach predictions difficult @xcite .",
    "a reliable simulation of the rather complex @xmath4 process nucleosynthesis pattern in this mass range is of great relevance in particular to differentiate between the contributions from @xmath4 process , @xmath8 process , and @xmath9 process sites .",
    "this also requires testing the applicability and reliability of the global hauser feshbach predictions in this mass range .    in this paper",
    "we want to pursue our studies investigating the cross sections of @xmath0ge(p,@xmath1)@xmath2as and @xmath3ge(p , n)@xmath3as which are both associated with the reaction flow pattern in this mass range as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : reacpattern ] shows the complex reaction pattern during the first second of the shock front induced @xmath4 process .",
    "the reaction @xmath0ge(p,@xmath1)@xmath2as corresponds to a branch associated with the final abundance of the @xmath4 nucleus @xmath0ge in the @xmath4 process .",
    "the proton capture direction gives rise to depletion of this nucleus at low @xmath4 process temperatures whereas the reverse rate can produce it through a ( @xmath1,n)-(@xmath1,p ) branching at higher temperature .",
    "the reaction @xmath3ge(p , n)@xmath3as is directly associated with the transformation of the @xmath9 process seed nucleus @xmath3ge to the @xmath4 nucleus @xmath19se in the first moments of @xmath4 process nucleosynthesis ; for example through the @xmath3ge(p , n)@xmath3as(@xmath1,n)@xmath18as(p , n)@xmath18se(@xmath1,n)@xmath19se reaction chain .",
    "[ fig : reacpattern ] suggests that many alternative reaction sequences exist , but it also underlines that during the @xmath4 process @xmath3ge is not only depleted but also produced by an initial @xmath19ge(n,@xmath1)@xmath18ge(n,@xmath1)@xmath3ge reaction flux .",
    "this modifies the initial @xmath3ge abundance .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the reaction rate of @xmath3ge(p , n)@xmath3as as the sole depletion process is important to investigate the overall nucleosynthesis pattern and history of @xmath3ge in a type ii supernova shock front environment .",

    "the proton capture data is excellently predicted by the previously published non - smoker hauser - feshbach calculation @xcite .",
    "also the ( p , n ) data is reproduced reasonably well although the data seem to indicate a slightly different slope of the @xmath5 factor as function of energy .",
    "since the computation of the relevant quantity for astrophysics , the reaction rate , involves an integration across the energy range given by the gamow peak ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the observed deviation is averaged out and barely appears in the rates at @xmath4-process temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthwhile to study the origin of the different behavior of the relation between data and predictions in the two cases of radiative capture and ( p , n ) reaction .    at first",
    ", it has to be realized that the theoretical ( p,@xmath1 ) and ( p , n ) results exhibit different dependences on nuclear inputs .",
    "the averaged statistical model cross sections @xmath43 are derived from averaged widths @xmath44 , leading to an expression similar to that of resonant reactions @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 labeling the entrance and exit channel , respectively , and @xmath48 being the averaged total width including all possible deexcitation channels ( particle and photon emission ) of the compound nucleus . as is well - known in the resonant case , the energy dependence is then determined by the smallest width in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hf ] ) .",
    "the situation is more involved if the widths are of similar magnitude or if another channel is significantly contributing to the total width .    in order to study the sensitivities of the calculated @xmath5 factors",
    ", we systematically and independently varied the averaged widths of the neutron , proton , and @xmath1 channels by factors of 2 up and down .",
    "as expected , the ( p , n ) @xmath5 factor is only sensitive to variations in the proton width @xmath49 in the entrance channel , except for an energy range of up to about 100 kev above the threshold where neutron widths are still small .",
    "this shows that the ( p , n ) reaction is well suited to study the impact of the optical potential used to compute the proton widths .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the ( p,@xmath1 ) case .",
    "all widths were varied but only the proton and @xmath1 widths were found to be important .",
    "the sensitivity to a variation of the proton and @xmath1 widths is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensi ] , with the sensitivity @xmath8 assuming values between zero and one .",
    "it is defined via the variation of the cross section ( @xmath5 factor ) @xmath50 , with the width variation factor @xmath51 chosen to be 2 and 0.5 , respectively . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensi ] the @xmath5 factor is mostly sensitive to the proton widths at energies below about 2.5 mev . above that energy",
    "the @xmath1 width sensitivity becomes comparable or larger .",
    "this implies that  contrary to the ( p , n ) reaction which is sensitive to the proton width at all measured energies  the @xmath5 factor is mostly sensitive to the proton width at the lowest energy .",
    "the excellent agreement of theory and measurement shows that the proton width is described well at low energies and that @xmath1 widths are described well at the upper end of the measured energy range .    for completeness , also the impact of a variation of the nuclear level density was studied .",
    "the nuclear level densities in the target and final nucleus determine the number of possible transitions in the entrance and exit channel , respectively , and thus impact the size of averaged widths .",
    "in the cases studied here , however , a variation of the nuclear level density does not have any impact .",
    "this is because the calculation uses up to 20 discrete experimental levels in each nucleus at low excitation energies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of the levels ) . in all cases studied here , transitions to those lowest levels",
    "dominate the widths and therefore varying the nuclear level density employed above these levels does not change the result .      apparently , the optical potential used for calculation of the proton widths gives rise to the different energy dependence of the theoretical ( p , n ) @xmath5 factor as compared to experiment .",
    "the optical potential used here is the widely - used semi - microscopic potential of @xcite with low - energy modifications by @xcite ( this will be addressed as jlm potential in the following ) , based on an infinite nuclear matter calculation employing the reid hard core interaction , the brckner - hartree - fock approximation , and a local density approximation .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the jlm potential may have to be improved above 160 mev projectile energy and that its isovector components may be too weak .",
    "the former is not relevant here but the latter can also have an impact at the low energies of astrophysical interest . a new parameterization of the jlm model has been derived in @xcite and then improved to be lane - consistent , i.e.  equally applicable to neutrons and protons , in @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our ( p , n ) data with the results obtained when using this latter potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ge76pn_theory ] .",
    "obviously , the original jlm potential still fares much better in reproducing both the energy dependence and the absolute magnitude of the @xmath5 factor .",
    "similar problems were already found for se isotopes in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ge70pg_theory ] shows that the low - energy @xmath5 factor of the ( p,@xmath1 ) reaction is severely underpredicted .",
    "the agreement at the upper end of the measured energy range is not surprising because the sensitivity to the proton potential is smaller there , as discussed above .",
    "we have attempted to improve the jlm potential by modifying the strengths of its real and imaginary parts .",
    "we find that an increase of the imaginary strength by 70% yields the best compromise in reproducing both the ( p , n ) and ( p,@xmath1 ) data , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ge76pn_theory ] and [ fig : ge70pg_theory ] .",
    "the results are extremely sensitive to a variation of the real part and therefore best agreement is found when adopting the original real strength .",
    "a behavior similar to the results when using the potential of @xcite is found for the ( p,@xmath1 ) reaction when increasing the real part only slightly .    since both the isoscalar and isovector parts of the jlm model",
    "contribute to the imaginary part , we can not disentangle their individual importance .",
    "following the argumentation of @xcite , we attribute the increase in the imaginary part to a stronger isovector component .",
    "however , the isovector component of the real part has to remain unchanged .",
    "it is conceivable that a different low - energy parameterization of the jlm model may yield similar results .",
    "radiative proton capture and ( p , n ) reactions at astrophysically relevant energies in this mass region were previously studied involving sr @xcite and se isotopes @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that our modified jlm potential also leads to an improved prediction of the reactions @xmath52sr(p,@xmath1)@xmath53y , @xmath54se(p,@xmath1)@xmath55br , and @xmath56se(p , n)@xmath56br , as shown in figs .",

    "although the theoretical @xmath5 factors have come closer to the experimental ones , there still remains a discrepancy of about a factor of two .",
    "we were not able to establish an unambiguous explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "the predicted cross sections are insensitive to the theoretical nuclear level density employed , the level schemes of @xmath57sr and @xmath58y are sufficiently well established at low excitation energies , and the deformations of the nuclei involved are comparable to those of the other cases studied .",
    "the only difference from the experimental point of view is the much longer half - life of @xmath58y ( 106.7 d ) .",
    "this is longer by a factor of at least 200 than the half - lives of the other final nuclei appearing in the activation experiments .",
    "it should be mentioned that the jlm approach is also used for neutron potentials .",
