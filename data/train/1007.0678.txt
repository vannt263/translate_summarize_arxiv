    "precisely ,    let @xmath0 be a countable group with a left invariant proper metric @xmath1 . a subgroup @xmath2 has _ bounded packing _ in @xmath0 ( with respect to @xmath1 ) if for each positive constant @xmath3 , there is a natural number @xmath4 such that , for any collection @xmath5 of @xmath6 left @xmath2-cosets in @xmath0 , there exist at least two @xmath2-cosets @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8",
    ".    bounded packing of a subgroup is independent of the choice of the left invariant proper metric @xmath1 .",
    "equivalently , bounded packing says that for each positive constant @xmath3 , every collection of left @xmath2-cosets in @xmath0 with pairwise distance at most @xmath3 has a uniform bound @xmath4 on their cardinality .",

    "a group is called _ subgroup separable _ or _ lerf _ if every finitely generated subgroup is separable .",

    "a group is called _ slender _ if every subgroup is finitely generated .",

    "given such a collection @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 for any @xmath15 , @xmath16 . without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath2 belongs to @xmath13 , up to a translation of @xmath13 by an appropriate element of @xmath0 .",

    "we claim that no two different left @xmath2-cosets of @xmath13 lie in the same left @xmath26-coset . by way of contradiction",
    ", we suppose that there are two @xmath2-cosets @xmath29 , @xmath30 in the same coset @xmath31 such that @xmath32 . by a similar argument as above",

    "moreover , we note that @xmath36 .",
    "since we have @xmath37 for some @xmath38 , it is easy to see that @xmath39 belongs to @xmath26 .",
