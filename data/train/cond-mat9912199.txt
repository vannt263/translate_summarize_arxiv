    "metastability is the persistence for a long time of a phase which is not the equilibrium phase .",
    "it can be both a blessing and a curse . in protein solutions it is a curse .",
    "protein crystals are required for x - ray crystallography to determine their full structure @xcite but protein solutions at concentrations well in excess of the solubility of the crystalline phase are often stable essentially indefinitely ; the rate of nucleation of the crystalline phase is essentially zero . here , we consider a crude model of a globular protein and we find that depending on the parameters of the model , the dilute fluid phase may be stable indefinitely with respect to crystallisation . if the solution is cooled at some low density , it is stable with respect to crystallisation down to temperatures at which the solution undergoes a fluid - fluid transition .",
    "this transition has been observed in protein solutions @xcite .",
    "the agreement in the phase and nucleation behaviour between the simple model and experiment is encouraging .",
    "it is clear what underlies the behaviour of the model and we may hope that similar physics underlies the behaviour of globular proteins .",
    "the fluid is metastable for a wide range of parameters and temperatures because as the attractions are directional and short - ranged the crystal is only stable when these attractions are strong relative to the thermal energy @xmath0 .",
    "these strong attractions mean that the interfacial tension between the dilute fluid and crystalline phases is high and it is this that inhibits crystallisation .",
    "this suggests that to increase the nucleation rate the attractions should be modified to become more like that in argon or other simple atoms and molecules , i.e. , to become less anisotropic and longer ranged .",
    "the phase diagram will correspondingly become more like that of simple atomic fluids .",
    "the interactions between globular proteins are rather poorly understood but it seems clear that many of the attractive interactions are directional and quite short - ranged @xcite ; two protein molecules must not only be close to each other to attract each other but they must also be correctly oriented .",
    "an example is the attraction between hydrophobic patches on the surfaces of globular proteins ; only if the proteins are oriented so that these parts of their surfaces face each other is there an attraction .",
    "so , our model , specified in section 2 , contains directional attractions ; in fact for simplicity it contains only directional attractions .",
    "the model was introduced by us and its bulk phase behaviour calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we carefully define metastability and derive an approximate theory to tell us when the dilute fluid is metastable and when nucleation occurs .",
    "we then present and discuss results , and finish with a conclusion .",
    "our model is exactly the same as in ref .",
    "the potential is a pair potential @xmath1 which is a sum of two parts : a hard - sphere repulsion , @xmath2 , and a set of sites which mediate short - range , directional attractions .",
    "there are @xmath3 sites , where @xmath3 is an even integer . in order to keep the model as simple as possible there are",
    "no isotropic attractions and all the directional attractions are of the same strength .",
    "the sites come in pairs : a site on one particle binds only to the other site of the pair on another particle .",
    "the two sites of a pair are numbered consecutively so that an odd - numbered site , @xmath4 , binds only to the even - numbered site , @xmath5 .",
    "this is the only interaction between the sites , an odd - numbered site , @xmath4 , does not interact at all with sites other than the @xmath6th site .",
    "the orientation of site number @xmath4 is specified by means of a unit vector @xmath7 .",
    "we can write the interaction potential between a pair of particles as @xmath8 , \\label{pot}\\ ] ] where the dash on the first sum denotes that it is restricted to odd values of @xmath4 .",
    "the interactions between the sites on the two particles are @xmath9 , which is the interaction between site @xmath4 on particle 1 and site @xmath6 on particle 2 , and @xmath10 , which is the interaction between site @xmath4 on particle 2 and site @xmath6 on particle 1 .",
    "these are functions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are the scalar distance between the centres of particles 1 and 2 , the orientation of particle 1 and the orientation of particle 2 , respectively .",
    "the particle is rigid , but not axially symmetric , so its position is completely specified by the position of its centre and its orientation @xmath14 , which may be expressed in terms of the three euler angles .",
    "the hard - sphere potential , @xmath2 , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hard - sphere diameter .",
    "the conical - site interaction potential @xmath17 is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angle between a line joining the centres of the two particles and the unit vector @xmath7 of particle 1 , and @xmath20 is the angle between a line joining the centres of the two particles and the unit vector @xmath21 of particle 2 .",
    "the conical - site potential depends on two parameters : the range , @xmath22 , and the maximum angle at which a bond is formed , @xmath23 .",
    "of course , as the attractions are directional , @xmath23 will be small , no more than about @xmath24 .",
    "the attractions are also short ranged , @xmath22 no more than 10% larger than @xmath16 .",
    "the angles between the site orientations , the vectors @xmath7 will determine which crystal lattice is formed . for simplicity , we will take the sites to be arranged such that they are compatible with a simple cubic lattice .",
    "then if we express the unit vectors @xmath7 in cartesian coordinates , @xmath25 , then when we have four sites , @xmath26 , the set of vectors @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 would describe our model . for six sites",
    "then we add two additional sites at orientations @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "later on when we discuss the metastable fluid we will discuss rates . in order to do this",
    "we let @xmath33 be the characteristic time for the dynamics in the dilute fluid .",
    "we will not need to specify @xmath33 exactly but it is of order the time a molecule takes to diffuse the average separation between the molecules .",
    "the free energies of the fluid and bulk phases were derived in our previous paper , ref .",

    "@xcite for details .      the theory for the fluid phase of particles interacting via a hard - core and directional attractions mediated by sites",

    "the volume fraction @xmath39 is a reduced density , it is the fraction of the solution s volume occupied by the molecules . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the number of molecules and the volume , respectively .",

    "@xmath45 is the fraction of sites which are _ not _ bonded to another site . as all site - site interactions are equivalent the fraction of each type of site which is not bonded is the same .",
    "the fraction of sites which are bonded and the fraction which are not bonded must , of course , add up to one .",

    ", crystallisation is driven by the attractive interactions , not packing effects as it is with hard spheres . in ref .",
    "@xcite we used a cell theory to describe the free energy of the crystalline phase of our model @xcite .",
    "the theory is a low - temperature theory and we will use it only at low temperatures .",
    "vega and monson @xcite used a cell theory to describe the solid phase of a very similar model , a simple model of water .",
    "they avoid a couple of the approximations used here at the cost of not having an analytical free energy . within a cell theory for a solid phase ,",
    "the helmholtz free energy per particle , @xmath60 , is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the partition function of a single particle trapped in a cage formed by the requirements that all its @xmath3 sites bond to neighbouring particles , and that its hard core not overlap with any of these neighbours .",
    "if the lattice constant is @xmath63 , then the particle can move a distance distance @xmath64 in the direction of any of its neighbours , without overlapping with the neighbour .",
    "in order for the bonds to not be broken the particle must always be within @xmath22 of the surrounding particles .",
    "this fixes the lattice constant , @xmath63 , at a little less than @xmath22 .",
    "it is a little less as when the particle moves off the lattice site it will be moving towards some of its neighbours and away from others .",
    "thus it can explore regions where it is further than @xmath63 from some of its neighbours .",
    "the exact value of the maximum lattice constant for which the particle can move about , constrained by the hard - sphere interactions , without breaking any bond , is difficult to estimate ; as is the volume available to the centre of mass of the particle @xcite .",
    "therefore , we approximate the lattice constant @xmath63 by @xmath22 and the volume to which the particle is restricted by @xmath65 .",
    "the requirement that no bonds be broken also severely restricts the orientations of the particle . when a non - axially symmetric particle is free to rotate it explores an angular phase space of @xmath66",
    "however , in the crystal its rotations will be restricted to those which are small enough not to violate the requirement that the orientations of its site vectors are within @xmath23 of the lines joining the centre of the particle with the those of the neighbouring particles . again the exact value of angular space available to the particle is complex , and it also depends on the position of the particle .",
    "we approximate this angular space by assuming that each of the three angular degrees of freedom can vary independently over a range of @xmath67 .",
    "the normalised angular space available to a particle in the solid phase is then @xmath68 .",
    "the energy per particle is , of course , @xmath69 , and so the partition function , @xmath62 , is then just the volume available to the centre of mass of the particle times the angular space available times @xmath70 $ ] , where @xmath71 is the integral over the momentum degrees of freedom .",

    "the chemical potential @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the pressure and @xmath82 is the density . at low pressure @xmath83",

    "we derive a simple but rather crude approximation for the equilibrium density of crystalline clusters in a dilute fluid .",

    ", the supersaturation at the critical point tends to zero , reducing the nucleation rate to zero .    as this work has been motivated by the difficult and important problem of crystallising globular proteins it is interesting to speculate on how the model of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] could be crystallised .",
    "the nucleation rate is far too low in the dilute fluid so in order to increase the rate the fluid must either be made more dense or the attractions strengthened . both of these may result in equilibrium being difficult to reach with the result that fluid could become gel - like .",
    "also , if the fluid undergoes a fluid - fluid transition its density and hence its nucleation rate jumps @xcite .",
    "there is an optimum nucleation rate to obtain good , i.e. , large with few defects , crystals .",
    "now , if there were no fluid - fluid transition then the crystalline cluster densities and hence the nucleation rate vary continuously but at condensation the densities will jump so there is a risk that the nucleation rate will jump over the optimum one making good crystals hard to obtain .",
    "crystallisation would be facilitated if the free energy cost of the surface of the cluster , the second term in the exponential of eq .",
    "( [ rhocfin ] ) , was less .",
    "if the interactions were less directional then the crystal would be stable at higher temperatures , i.e. , smaller values of @xmath51 , where the surface would have a lower free energy .",

    "the value of the second virial coefficient of a van der waals fluid ( with the carnahan - starling equation for the hard sphere part of the free energy ) at the critical temperature is given as @xmath177 .",
