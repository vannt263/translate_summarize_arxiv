    "neutrinos are the only way known to directly probe the dynamics of the solar core  @xcite , and , through the mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect  @xcite , they can even carry information about the rest of the solar envelope . to date ,",
    "however , converting measurements of solar neutrino fluxes into constraints on solar models has proven to be difficult  @xcite , because of the large number of co - varying parameters upon which such models are built .    a relatively simple signal that could tell us something new about the sun would be a time - variation in the neutrino fluxes . over the past forty years",
    ", measurements made by solar neutrino experiments have therefore been the focus of many studies , ranging from attempted correlations with the solar sunspot cycle to open searches for signals with periods of weeks or months  @xcite .",
    "the shortest period examined to date is roughly one day , where the msw effect predicts that neutrinos propagating through the earth s core during the night will undergo flavor transformation in much the same way they do in the sun , resulting in a net gain in the flux of electron neutrinos ( @xmath2s ) . although there have been occasional claims of signals on timescales similar to known variations in the solar magnetic field , in all cases there have been conflicting measurements that show the signals to be spurious or absent entirely .",
    "we present in this article the results of a search in a new frequency regime for solar time variations .",
    "our focus has been on signals whose periods range from 24 hours down to 10 minutes .",
    "the motivation for such a high frequency search is in part the expectation for solar helioseismological variations on scales of order an hour or less , in particular solar ` gravity modes ' ( @xmath0-modes )  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0-modes are non - radial oscillations that are predicted to be confined to the solar core , and thus could in principle affect either neutrino production or neutrino propagation .",
    "the neutrinos that sno detects , those from @xmath1b decay within the sun , are particularly well - suited for our search because they are created very deep within the solar core and because their propagation is known to be sensitive to variations in the solar density profile through the msw effect .",
    "the effects of @xmath0-modes on solar neutrino fluxes have been examined by bahcall and kumar  @xcite , who sought to determine whether @xmath0-mode effects could explain the apparent solar neutrino deficit , finding that any effect was far too small to account for the roughly 60% discrepancy .",
    "more recently ,  @xcite looked at ways in which a broad spectrum of @xmath0-modes could alter the expectation for a solar neutrino spectral distortion caused by the msw effect .",
    "nevertheless , there are at this time no explicit predictions as to whether @xmath0-modes or any other short - timescale variations could lead to measurable solar neutrino flux variations .",
    "sno was an imaging cherenkov detector using heavy water ( d@xmath3o ) as both the interaction and detection medium  @xcite .",
    "the sno cavern is located in vale inco s creighton mine , at @xmath4 n latitude , @xmath5 w longitude .",
    "the detector resided 1783 m below sea level with an overburden of @xmath6  m water equivalent , deep enough that the rate of cosmic - ray muons passing through the entire active volume was just three per hour .",
    "one thousand metric tons of heavy water were contained in a 12  m diameter transparent acrylic vessel ( av ) .",
    "cherenkov light produced by neutrino interactions and radioactive backgrounds was detected by an array of 9456 hamamatsu model r1408 20-cm photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , supported by a stainless steel geodesic sphere ( the pmt support structure or psup ) .",
    "each pmt was surrounded by a light concentrator ( a ` reflector ' ) , which increased the light collection to nearly @xmath7% . over seven kilotonnes ( 7000 kg ) of light water",
    "shielded the heavy water from external radioactive backgrounds : 1.7  ktonne between the acrylic vessel and the pmt support sphere , and 5.7  ktonne between the pmt support sphere and the surrounding rock .",
    "the 5.7  ktonne of light water outside the pmt support sphere were viewed by 91 outward - facing 20-cm pmts that were used for identification of cosmic - ray muons .",
    "the detector was equipped with a versatile calibration deployment system which could place radioactive and optical sources over a large range of the @xmath8-@xmath9 and @xmath10-@xmath9 planes in the av .",
    "in addition , periodic ` spikes ' of short - lived radioactivity ( such as @xmath11rn ) were added to both the light water and heavy water and distributed throughout their volumes to act as distributed calibration sources .",
    "sno detected neutrinos through three different processes :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     where @xmath12 represents @xmath2 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 . for both the elastic scattering ( es ) and charged current ( cc ) reactions , the recoil electrons were observed directly by their production of cherenkov light . for the neutral current ( nc ) reaction ,",
    "the neutrons were not seen directly , but were detected when they captured on another nucleus . in sno phase i ( the `` d@xmath3o phase '' ) , the neutrons captured on the deuterons present within the sno heavy water .",
    "the capture on deuterium releases a 6.25  mev @xmath15 ray , and it is the cherenkov light of the secondary compton electrons or @xmath16 pairs which was detected . in phase ii , ( the `` salt phase '' ) ,",
    "2 tonnes of nacl were added to the heavy water , and the neutrons captured predominantly on @xmath17cl nuclei .",
    "chlorine has a much larger capture cross section ( resulting in a higher detection efficiency ) for the neutrons .",
    "the capture on chlorine also yields multiple @xmath15s instead of the single @xmath15 from the pure d@xmath3o phase , which aids in the identification of neutron events .",
    "figure  [ fig : b8spec ] shows the incident @xmath1b spectrum of neutrinos from the sun ( dotted line ) , along with those that are detected by the cc reaction ( dashed ) and those that are above the effective kinetic energy threshold for the resultant electrons in our detector for phase ii , @xmath18  mev .",
    "@xmath19 is the estimated energy assuming an event consisted of a single electron .",
    "b solar neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "the dotted curve is the incident spectrum of neutrinos from the sun with an arbitrary normalization , the dashed curve shows the spectrum of those detected by the cc reaction before any cut on the kinetic energy of the created electron , and the solid curve shows the spectrum of neutrinos seen after the application of the kinetic energy threshold for phase ii .",
    "[ fig : b8spec],width=480 ]    sno s depth , very low radioactivity levels , and its ability to perform real - time detection made it a unique instrument for observing time variations in solar neutrino fluxes , even at the high frequencies we examine here . above an energy threshold of 5  mev ,",
    "the rate of events from radioactivity , cosmic ray muons and atmospheric neutrinos , was negligible .",
    "the rate of solar neutrino events above this threshold was roughly 10/day .",
    "the event selection for the data sets is similar to that used in our lower - frequency periodicity analysis  @xcite .",
    "events were selected inside a reconstructed fiducial volume of @xmath20  cm and above an effective kinetic energy of @xmath21  mev ( phase i ) or @xmath22  mev ( phase ii ) , and below @xmath23  mev .",
    "additional analysis cuts such as fiducial volume and background rejection for these data sets have been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "sno phase i ran between november 2 , 1999 and may 31 , 2001 , and with detector deadtimes and periods of high radon removed , we recorded a total of 306.58 live days , with 2924 candidate neutrino events .",
    "sno phase ii ran from july 26 , 2001 to august 28 , 2003 for a total of 391.71 live days and 4722 candidate neutrino events .",
    "of the 2924 candidate events in the phase i data , 67% are due to cc interactions , 20% to nc interactions , and 9% to es interactions , with the remaining 4% due to backgrounds . variations in the @xmath1b neutrino production rate itself will affect all three neutrino interactions equally , while variations in the electron neutrino survival probability dominantly affect only the cc rate . for the phase ii data the 4722 events consist of 45% cc events , 42% nc events , 6% es events , and 7% backgrounds .    the time for each event was measured with a global positioning system ( gps ) clock to a resolution of @xmath24  ns , but truncated to 10  ms accuracy for the analysis .",
    "the run boundary times were determined from the times of the first and last events in each run with a precision of @xmath25  ms .",
    "the intervals between runs during which sno was not recording solar neutrino events correspond to run transitions , detector maintenance , calibration activities , and any periods when the detector was off .",
    "it is also necessary to account for deadtime incurred within a run ; for example , deadtime due to spallation cuts that remove events occurring within 20 seconds after a muon .",
    "this is important for a high - frequency periodicity search , as the frequency of occurrence of these deadtimes can approach the scale of interest of our search .",
    "therefore , both the run boundaries , as well as the smaller , discrete breaks in time due to removal of short - lived backgrounds such as spallation products , define the time exposure of the data set , which itself may induce frequency components that could affect a periodicity analysis .",
    "the low - frequency searches for periodicities that have been done by ourselves and others typically group the neutrino time series in bins of one to several days , and then perform the analysis with methods such as the lomb - scargle technique  @xcite . in our own low - frequency study",
    "@xcite , we also used an unbinned maximum likelihood technique , fitting the time series with periodic functions of varying frequencies , phases , and amplitudes , allowing for the detector deadtimes that occurred during calibration runs , power outages , and detector maintenance .    for this high - frequency study , we chose to use an unbinned rayleigh power approach .",
    "the rayleigh power of a time series for a given frequency @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the total number of events in the time series .",
    "the great advantage of the rayleigh power approach is its speed , as it requires far fewer function evaluations than other unbinned methods like the maximum likelihood technique described above . for this analysis ,",
    "speed is critical , because to ensure that we do not miss a signal we use 1.6 million equally - spaced frequencies spanning a range from 1/day to 144/day ( one cycle per 10 minutes ) . to avoid the possibility of a signal falling between our sampled frequencies , and thus being missed",
    ", the minimum gap between our sampled frequencies must correspond to two signals that just decorrelate over the course of sno s running period . with this criterion ,",
    "the minimum number of frequencies needed for our data set in our region of interest is 400,000 , and our choice of 1.6 million frequencies was made to provide a small degree of oversampling .    for a time series",
    "in which the phase coverage is uniform , the distribution of rayleigh powers for any given frequency follows @xmath29 , and thus confidence intervals can be easily calculated . for the sno data set ,",
    "there are significant deadtime intervals , whose durations range from months to milliseconds .",
    "the sources of these deadtime intervals include the period between the phase i and phase ii data sets ( several months ) , detector calibration runs ( typically hours to days ) , power outages ( of order one day ) , maintenance periods ( hours ) , and offline veto periods ( 15  ms to 20  s ) imposed to remove events associated with the passage of cosmic - ray muons through the detector , interactions of atmospheric neutrinos , or bursts of instrumental activity .",
    "the deadtime structure of the sno time series means that not all phases of the rayleigh power are equally likely , and thus leads to additional rayleigh power that is not associated with any neutrino signal .",
    "quasi - periodic deadtimes ( like those associated with calibration and maintenance ) can also lead to peaks in the rayleigh power spectrum . to calculate confidence intervals in order to determine the significance of any peaks observed in the rayleigh power spectrum , we must account for these known regions of non - uniform phase coverage .",
    "we have developed an analytic model for the rayleigh power at a given frequency by treating the rayleigh power series as a two - dimensional random walk .",
    "each detected event is treated as a step in the random walk , with components @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for the case of uniform phase coverage",
    ", the central limit theorem implies that for a large number of steps ( @xmath28 ) the distribution of final positions will be given by a two - dimensional gaussian , whose means , variances , and covariance are : @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 leading to a simple distribution of final positions given by @xmath35    the distribution of @xmath36 can then be obtained by integrating over all values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 which satisfy @xmath39 , by changing variables from @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 integrating this expression over @xmath43 from 0 to @xmath44 and changing variables from @xmath41 to @xmath36 gives @xmath45 , which is the simple exponential distribution expected for the rayleigh power distribution .    for the case of non - uniform coverage ,",
    "the means and covariance of the distribution are no longer simple . if we call the normalized phase - weighting function @xmath46 , where @xmath47 for uniform phase coverage , then we have @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    the function @xmath46 is determined by the detector s deadtime window , with @xmath53 .",
    "the mean for @xmath37 , for example , is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total livetime , and the sum is over all data taking runs in the data set , integrating from the start to the stop time of each run .",
    "the rayleigh power distribution for the non - uniform phase coverage case is proportional to @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for the rayleigh power distribution can be written as @xmath58    the inverse of the covariance matrix is given by    @xmath59    making our @xmath57 @xmath60    transforming into our integration variables @xmath36 and @xmath40 gives the rather unwieldy probability density function for the rayleigh power at a given frequency : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a normalization constant . in this formalism",
    "the effects of detector deadtime are entirely accounted for through the means and covariance matrix for the variables x and y. in the analysis of data from the two combined sno data - taking phases , the difference in event rates between phase",
    "i and phase ii is accounted for by separating the terms of the analytic form according to phase , or :    @xmath64    ( and similarly for all variance and covariance terms ) . here ,",

    "the distributions were generated with a monte carlo simulation including the sno detector s full deadtime window .",
    "for the plot on the left , the deadtime contributes a significant amount of power due to the periodicity in sno s operations schedule , while for the high frequency bin on the right the deadtime does not change the function much from its simple @xmath29 distribution .    to determine a specific confidence level , cl , for a given observed rayleigh power , @xmath66",
    ", we solve the equation @xmath67    as a test of our analytic model , we have calculated the confidence levels for all 1.6 million frequencies of a monte carlo simulation that includes the full sno deadtime window .",

    "our first search looked for a significant peak at any frequency in our rayleigh power spectrum .",
    "while equation  [ eq : cl ] gives the confidence level at any specific frequency , when testing our 1.6 million sampled frequencies there is a substantial trials penalty , making it exceedingly likely that at least one of the frequencies will by chance have an apparently large power . to determine this penalty exactly",
    ", we would need to know how many of our 1.6 million sampled frequencies are independent , which is a complex task .    instead , to address this trials penalty we use 10,000 null - hypothesis monte carlo simulations to determine the probability of observing a statistically significant peak at any of the 1.6 million sampled frequency in the absence of a true signal . for a given null - hypothesis monte carlo simulation ,",
    "we assign a frequency - specific confidence level to each sampled frequency according to the prescription given above in section  [ sec : rpwr ] ( see eq .",

    "<S> we have performed three searches for high - frequency signals in the solar neutrino flux measured by the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) , motivated by the possibility that solar @xmath0-mode oscillations could affect the production or propagation of solar @xmath1b neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the first search looked for any significant peak in the frequency range 1/day to 144/day , with a sensitivity to sinusoidal signals with amplitudes of 12% or greater . </S>",
    "<S> the second search focused on regions in which @xmath0-mode signals have been claimed by experiments aboard the soho satellite , and was sensitive to signals with amplitudes of 10% or greater . </S>",
    "<S> the third search looked for extra power across the entire frequency band . </S>",
    "<S> no statistically significant signal was detected in any of the three searches . </S>"
