    "as quasi one - dimensional field - effect transistors ( fets ) , based for example on carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) or silicon nanowires ( snws ) , are increasingly investigated as a possible replacement for conventional planar fets , it is important to achieve complete understanding of the properties of shot noise of one - dimensional conductors electrostatically controlled by a third ( gate ) electrode .",
    "shot noise is particularly sensitive to carrier - carrier interaction , that in turn can be particularly significant in one - dimensional nanoscale conductors , where electrons are few and screening is limited  @xcite .",
    "low frequency @xmath0 noise in quasi one - dimensional conductors has been the subject of interest for several authors  @xcite , whereas few experimental papers on shot noise have recently been published  @xcite . due to the small amount of mobile charge in nanoscale one - dimensional fets , even in strong inversion ,",
    "drain current fluctuations can heavily affect device electrical behavior .",
    "of course , noise is an unavoidable and undesirable feature of electron devices , and its effect must be minimized or kept within tolerable levels for the operation of electronic circuits . from a more fundamental point of view , it is also a rich source of information on electron - electron interaction , which can not be obtained from dc or ac electrical characteristics .",
    "the main sources of noise are injection from the contacts into the device region , through the random occupation of states around the fermi energy at the contacts , and partial transmission of electrons through the conductor , which gives rise to the so called partition noise .",
    "the main types of interaction that have a clear effect on noise are pauli exclusion , which reduces fluctuations of the rate of injected electrons by limiting the occupancy of injected states , and coulomb repulsions among electrons , which is the cause of fluctuations of the potential in the device region , that often suppress , but sometimes enhance the effect of fluctuations in the rate of injected electrons .",
    "the combined effect of pauli exclusion and coulomb repulsion on shot noise has been investigated in the case of ballistic double gate mosfets  @xcite , in planar mosfets  @xcite and in resonant tunneling diodes  @xcite .",
    "there are still few attempts  @xcite to a complete quantitative understanding of shot noise in ballistic cnt- and snw - fets .",
    "indeed , when addressing a resonant tunneling diode one can usually adopt an approach that exploits the fact that the two opaque barriers break the device in three loosely coupled regions ( the two contacts and the well ) , among which transitions can described by fermi golden rule , as has been done in refs .",
    "this is not possible in the case of a transistor , where coupling between the channel and the contacts is very good .",
    "another important issue is represented by the fact that the widely known landauer - bttiker s noise formula  @xcite , does not take into account the effect of coulomb interaction on shot noise through potential fluctuations .",
    "indeed , recent experiments on shot noise in cnt - based fabry perot interferometers  @xcite show that in some bias conditions many - body corrections might be needed to explain the observed noise suppression .",
    "other experiments show that at low temperature suspended ropes of single - wall carbon nanotubes of length 0.4 @xmath1 m exhibit a significant suppression of current fluctuations by a factor smaller than 1/100 compared to full shot noise  @xcite . however , this experimental result is not supported by a convincing interpretation , since possible explanations extend from ballistic transport in a small number of tubes within a rope , to diffusive transport in a substantial fraction of the cnts . in this work",
    ", we present an expression for the shot noise power spectral density of ballistic quasi - one dimensional channels based on a statistical approach relying on quantities obtained from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of randomly injected electrons from the reservoirs .",
    "the expression is derived within the second quantization formalism , and simulations are based on the self - consistent solution of the 3d poisson and schrdinger equations , within the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "our proposed expression generalizes the landauer - bttiker s noise formula including the effects of coulomb interaction , that is significant for a large class of devices , and in particular for one - dimensional conductors .",
    "according to milatz s theorem  @xcite , the power spectral density of the noise current in the zero frequency limit can be written as @xmath2 lim@xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the injection rate of a carrier from a contact and @xmath5 is the variance of the current . according to ref.@xcite",
    ", @xmath4 can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy discretization step , i.e. the minimum energy separation between injected states .",
    "indeed , the contribution to the current of a transverse mode in the energy interval @xmath7 can be expressed in the zero temperature limit by the landauer - bttiker formula as @xmath8 . on the other hand @xmath9 , from which @xmath6 derives .",
    "finally , the power spectral density of shot noise at zero frequency can be expressed as : @xmath10 the variance of the current can be derived by means of the second quantization formalism , which allows a concise treatment of the many - electron problem .",
    "let us consider a mesoscopic conductor connected to two reservoirs [ source ( s ) and drain ( d ) ] , where electron states are populated according to their fermi occupation factors ( fig .",
