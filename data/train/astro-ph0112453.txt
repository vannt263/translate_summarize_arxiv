    "when working with x - ray data each x - ray mission has its own software package to reduce the data due to the specific requirements of the detectors onboard . for the xmm - newton mission the reduction software package xmmsas has been developed .",
    "the main purpose of the xmmsas is to allow users to take the observational data file ( odf ) and create event files and at a later stage scientific files like images , spectra and lightcurves .",
    "each xmmsas task has a manual either in html format or as a postscript file ( please see at to get the whole list of available xmmsas tasks ) .",
    "the manual gives a description of the tasks and lists all available task parameters .",
    "however , this is often confusing to new users of the xmmsas in order to see which tasks are needed and how they have to be applied to their data . for this reason at mpe the idea was born to design a web - based cookbook that explains users how to work with their xmm - newton observational data files ( odf ) in order to create final scientific files like spectra and light curves . at first",
    "this cookbook was only written for users at mpe , but it has been now designed and make accessible to users from outside the mpe .",
    "to explain the tasks that have to be performed to create event files and finally scientific files , the cookbook first describes general tasks and is then organized by the instruments onboard xmm . there are chapters for epic pn , epic mos , the rgs , and the optical monitor ( om).the two epic chapters have an introductory part and are then split into sections for spatial , spectral and timing analysis of the data .",
    "fig [ epic_pn_page ] displays as an example the epic pn page .",
    "the cookbook has the following structure :    1 .",
    "general tasks 2 .",
    "data preparation 3 .",
    "epic pn * spatial analysis * spectral analysis * timing analysis 4 .",
    "epic mos * spatial analysis * spectral analysis * timing analysis 5 .",
    "the mpe cookbook for the xmmsas can be found here :",
    "the mpe xmmsas ` cookbook ' is of course not the only description of the xmmsas .",
    "first there is esa s official xmmsas users guide which is available at vilspa :"
