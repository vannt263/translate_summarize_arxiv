    "`` asymmetric '' means that the bragg reflecting atomic planes are not parallel to the crystal surface .",
    "understanding the time dependence of x - ray bragg diffraction in crystals has attracted much attention since the 1990s , as the advent of ultra - fast ( femtosecond short ) x - rays pulses become a close reality .",
    "the temporal and spatial dependence of diffraction was first calculated using the time dependent takagi - taupin equations .",
    "in particular , an analytical solution for the bragg reflected wave from an infinitely thick crystal was derived by chukhovskii and frster @xcite .",
    "numeric calculations of the time dependence of bragg diffraction from a crystal heated by a laser pulse was performed in @xcite .",
    "calculations of the time dependence by fourier transforming the known monochromatic plane - wave solutions from the classical dynamical theory @xcite have been considered in several publications @xcite .",

    "@xcite performed numerical calculations , which have revealed signature features of time dependences of bragg diffraction from crystals both in the bragg - case and in the laue - case geometries .",
    "graeff and malgrange @xcite obtained analytical solutions for the time dependence of bragg diffraction in the laue geometry , with the refraction effects at the crystal exit surface taken into account .",
    "bushuev @xcite used fourier transformation of the plane - wave solutions both in the frequency and momentum space , with the second order corrections included to more accurately account for the refraction effects , to obtain solutions in time and space and analyzed specific cases using numeric calculations .",
    "the present paper is focused on the development of the theory and on the analysis of the spatiotemporal response of crystals in bragg diffraction to the excitation by an ultra short in time and spatially confined x - ray pulse in the general case of asymmetric reflection ( bragg ) and transmission ( laue ) scattering geometries .",
    "the primary goal of the present study is to understand the general phenomenology of the spatiotemporal response by uncovering the dominant underlying physics and identifying the key physical parameters that determine the characteristic time and space scales involved . for this purpose ,",
    "we derive comprehensive solutions that can be written in the general case as a product of two independent envelope functions : the first is a spatiotemporal plane - wave response function that depends only on the crystal and scattering geometry , while the second is an envelope that is specific to the initial conditions of the incident field .",
    "we derive analytical solutions for the response functions under several representative conditions , which clearly identifies the key physical parameters and makes possible a relatively simple interpretation of the general solution .",
    "when an ultra - short x - ray pulse instantaneously excites a perfect crystal , the output field is delayed and spread in time .",
    "the underlying reason behind this phenomenon is that each frequency component excites a monochromatic eigen - wavefield in the crystal that propagates along its own direction with its associated group velocity . as a consequence",

    "<S> the characteristic measure of the spatiotemporal response is expressed in terms of a few parameters : the extinction length , crystal thickness , bragg angle , asymmetry angle , and the speed of light .    </S>",
    "<S> applications to self - seeding of hard x - ray free electron lasers are discussed , with particular emphasis on the relative advantages of using either the bragg or laue scattering geometries . </S>",
    "<S> intensity front inclination in asymmetric diffraction can be used to make snapshots of ultra - fast processes with femtosecond resolution . </S>"
