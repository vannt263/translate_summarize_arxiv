    "in strongly interacting systems , the study of collective modes of a quantum many - body problem provides revealing information about the nature of the underlying hamiltonian . in ultracold atomic gases ,",
    "due to the fact that binary interactions between particles at low energy are well understood , the experimental measurement of collective modes provides a means of evaluating and potentially falsifying many - body theoretical methods used to describe these systems .",
    "experiments probing the collective modes of ultracold gases were carried out shortly after the demonstration of bose - einstein condensation in a dilute atomic vapor  @xcite . in early experiments at jila",
    "@xcite and mit  @xcite , the low - lying quadrupole modes of a nearly pure bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) were excited , and the observed oscillation frequencies showed good agreement with the bogoliubov spectrum  @xcite .",
    "experiments were then conducted over a range of temperatures below the critical point , and temperature dependent shifts in the oscillation frequencies and damping rates were observed  @xcite . at the time , existing theoretical models were unable to reproduce the experimental observations .",
    "the observation of these unexplained temperature dependent shifts motivated further exploration of collective mode behavior at finite temperature , where experiments probed the interaction between the condensate and thermal component of the gas ( i.e. non - condensate ) .",
    "experiments on the scissors modes  @xcite provided an alternative means of measurement of temperature dependent shifts of the mode frequencies and damping rates through observation of the angle oscillations of the condensate and non - condensate , and reasonable agreement with existing theories was found .",
    "furthermore , a study of the transverse breathing mode in an elongated harmonic trap  @xcite found uncharacteristically small damping rates and observed that the mode frequency was quasi - independent of temperature .    in order to address the unexpected behavior of the experiments",
    ", models were initially developed to explain the anomalous temperature dependence of the quadrupole mode found in ref .",
    "early efforts assuming a static non - condensate were unable to reproduce the experimental results ; however , inclusion of the dynamics of the non - condensate lead to a consistent framework that matched the experiment . using a semi - classical coupled - modes model ,",

    "the coupled - modes analysis suggests that the oscillation of a single component of the gas ( e.g. condensate ) is described by a superposition of two eigenmodes oscillating at slightly different frequencies .",

    "however , the limited data available from the @xmath75-plane suggests that the cloud was highly symmetric  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath76 in eq .   when calculating the amplitude of the condensate monopole mode .",
    "although we observe excitation of other collective modes ( dipole and quadrupole ) , we find that the key features of the experimental results for the monopole mode are independent of whether this assumption is made or @xmath77 is simply excluded from eq .  .",

    "the fitting function is of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are fit parameters .",
    "this functional form is chosen because we are concerned with the amplitude of the mode , not the frequency , which enables a straightforward linear regression analysis for computing @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",

    "[ fig : expdata1 ] , where time @xmath84 is defined as the point at which the modulation of the trap frequency ceases .",

    "there is a consistent collapse in the amplitude of the monopole mode between @xmath85@xmath86 , and a partial revival around @xmath87@xmath88 .",
    "motivated by the results of the coupled - modes analysis , we fit the data to an envelope function that represents the superposition of two sinusoidal modes , and we include an overall exponential damping factor to represent the loss of amplitude with time : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the initial amplitude , @xmath91 is the beat frequency , and @xmath92 is the damping rate of the envelope . the results of this fit are overlaid with the data in fig .

    ", we find @xmath93 on average , and damping rates in the range @xmath94@xmath95 . the observed beat frequency is less than @xmath39 as expected from the coupled - modes analysis .",
    "we attribute this disagreement to the naive form of the fitting function , which assumes that the two sinusoidal modes damp at the same rate , respond equally to the trap frequency perturbation , and have no phase difference between them .",
    "these assumptions are investigated further in the next section where the two sinusoidal modes are identified with the in - phase and out - of - phase modes predicted by the coupled - modes analysis .    before moving on ,",
    "it is important to note that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that anharmonic corrections to the trap geometry were likely responsible for the anomalous exponential damping of the monopole mode observed above the critical temperature  @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this damping is @xmath96 for clouds with a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath97 . in this work , the fwhm of the cloud below the critical temperature satisfies this criterion",
    "; thus , we neglect anharmonic corrections to the trap geometry as the observed damping rate is approximately an order of magnitude larger .",
    "we now investigate the damping observed in the experimental data through numerical simulations within the zng formalism .",
    "the coupled - modes analysis ignores collisions and exchange of particles between the two components , as well as nonlinear mean - field effects .",
    "however , below the critical temperature , these interactions between the condensate and non - condensate can shift the frequencies of collective modes and cause damping .",
    "collisions that exchange energy and particles between the two components of the gas cause collisional damping  @xcite , whereas mean - field effects lead to landau damping ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for further discussion ) and beliaev damping  @xcite .",
    "landau damping describes a process where a collective mode decays due to its interaction with a thermal distribution of excitations , and it is expected to dominate at higher temperatures approaching the critical temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "beliaev damping is a process where a collective mode decays into two lower energy excitations , which is suppressed for the lowest energy collective modes of a trapped gas due to the discretization of energy levels .",
    "thus , the beliaev process is absent for the monopole mode , and is therefore excluded from our analysis in this paper . in the remainder of this section , we discuss the zng formalism and describe the results of numerical simulations in the context of the coupled - modes analysis and experimental data already presented .",

    "we have performed additional simulations based on the classical field ( c - field ) formalism , full details of which are described in appendix  [ appendix : cfield ] . for a smaller system of @xmath158 atoms we found reasonable agreement with the zng method for the in - phase mode ( dominated by the condensate ) .",
    "however , for the out - of - phase mode ( dominated by the non - condensate ) the two methods show substantial differences in the oscillation frequency and damping rate .",
    "in conclusion , we have experimentally observed non - exponential collapse and subsequent revival of the monopole mode of a finite temperature bec in an isotropic magnetic trap .",
    "a coupled - modes analysis was used to study the linear response of the system to external perturbation , the results of which are the identification of two eigenmodes of the system corresponding to in - phase and out - of - phase oscillations of the condensate and non - condensate .",
    "these modes appear to be collisionless analogues to the first and second sound modes as previously discussed in ref .",
    "simultaneous excitation of these two modes results in the observed collapse and partial revival of the condensate monopole mode , which has a timescale compatible with the mismatch in the eigenfrequencies .",

    "an alternative approach to simulate the dynamics of becs at finite temperature is the classical field , or c - field methodology  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , a classical field treatment of a bec will be a reasonable approximation when the system has a significant number of modes with large occupation numbers @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the energy of the mode  @xcite . in these circumstances",
    "the gpe can be a good description of the dynamics of this part of the system , rather than only the condensate itself as in the zng formalism .",
    "the stochastic projected gpe ( spgpe ) methodology  @xcite describes the non - classical ( or thermal gas ) modes as a static finite temperature reservoir , whereas the projected gpe ( pgpe ) methodology  @xcite entirely neglects the coupling to these higher energy modes .",
    "these techniques have the advantage compared to zng that they go beyond the hartree - fock treatment of the low - lying modes , and treat their interaction with the condensate nonperturbatively  @xcite .",
    "however , current implementations of these methods have the significant limitation compared to zng in that the majority of the thermal cloud is static ( spgpe ) or missing ( pgpe ) , potentially neglecting an important part of the physics when it comes to considering the interplay of the condensate and thermal clouds .",
    "this was pointed out , for example , by bezett and blakie  @xcite who used a pgpe methodology to simulate the experiments of jin et al .",
    "@xcite .    despite these reservations ,",
    "we have performed c - field simulations of the experiments described in this paper to gain further insight into the collapse and revival behavior . due to the unfavorable scaling of harmonically trapped pgpe simulations with atom number  @xcite we chose to simulate a total of @xmath161 atoms with all other parameters being the same to test the methodology .",
