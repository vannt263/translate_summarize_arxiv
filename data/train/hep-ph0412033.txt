    "there is , however , a distinct change in this relationship for weakly charged condensates .",
    "this change in scaling behavior is accompanied by ( or results from ) the appearance of q - balls carrying a charge opposite in sign to that initially carried by the condensate in addition to those of the same sign .",

    "we will simply assume charge creation has occurred .",

    "examining the form of the potential ( [ eq : pot ] ) tells us that for such small @xmath1 values , we can use the effective baryon - conserving potential : @xmath10 where the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath11 is essential to q - ball stability .",
    "we will discuss this point in the next section .",

    "the noether current for our complex scalar is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the baryon charge per meson of the field @xmath1 .",
    "now we can use equations ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) and ( [ eq : charge ] ) to see that the total charge can be expressed @xcite : @xmath26",
    "having studied the properties of q - balls , we now investigate whether they are likely to be formed in an ad baryogenesis scenario . for a strongly charged condensate",
    ", we anticipate that the uniform scalar field could simply fracture into stable q - balls . in the last section",
    ", we showed that the q - balls will have a characteristic size .",
    "therefore , the process of breakup should yield q - balls with a charge @xmath27 proportional to the initial charge density of the condensate @xmath28 @xcite where @xmath28 in the simulations of @xcite is defined as the charge density when @xmath29 .",
    "the exact proportionality will depend on the time at which breakup occurs .",
    "this is because in an expanding universe the baryon charge density will fall with time . for a matter - dominated universe ( affleck - dine baryogenesis occurs during the epoch of inflationary reheating when inflaton matter dominates the energy density of the universe ) ,",
    "the charge density decreases as @xmath30 .",
    "we first show that a strongly charged condensate is energetically capable of breaking into stable q - balls .",
    "recall that coleman s condition for q - ball stability is that the energy per charge in the q - ball be less than the energy per charge in free particles of the scalar field in question .",
    "the energy of free scalars , however , is simply the mass of the field : @xmath31 .",
    "this line of reasoning leads directly to equation ( [ eq : qball ] ) @xcite .",
    "that equation tells us that the binding energy per charge for a thin - walled q - ball will be : @xmath32 where @xmath17 is the field value within the q - ball .",
    "note that this binding energy can be maximized in gravity mediated scenarios at the specific value @xmath33 defined in equation ( [ eq : vevqball ] ) .",
    "a problem arises when we try to calculate the value of the binding energy , however .",
    "it is a well - known difficulty ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the running mass of our scalar field has an infrared divergence associated with @xmath34 .",
    "even worse , however , the one - loop running becomes untrustworthy for large values of the log term , since the next loop order will bring in higher powers of the log .",
    "this implies that we can not actually calculate the mass of a free @xmath1 meson by one - loop running from the value of the mass at large @xmath1 and , more importantly , the qualitative behavior becomes suspect at large values of the log term",
    ".    this could be a very important issue for thick - walled q - balls , which necessitate @xmath35 so that we are already stretching the one - loop running to the limits of applicability .",
    "if we want to have a truer idea of the q - ball binding energy , we should try to make use of the renormalization group , or at the very least move to two - loop running .",
    "this has not been attempted in the numerical simulations to date , however .",
    "therefore , let us consider the consequences of assuming simple one - loop running holds over a large range of @xmath1 .    with this assumption",
    ", we see that although @xmath33 maximizes the binding energy per charge , the binding energy will remain positive ( formally infinite ) for any value @xmath36 .",
    "this is very important for us , since we have already shown that the ad scenario will only generate thick - walled q - balls .",
    "we can now see that they are potentially stable .",
    "unfortunately , our discussion so far is not technically valid for thick - walled q - balls since they will require the addition of a gradient term to the expression for the q - ball energy .",
    "the energy of a complex scalar field is given by @xcite : @xmath37.\\ ] ] note that if we do have gradient energy , we can treat it as an effective contribution to the scalar potential .",
    "that is , we can define an effective potential for thick - walled q - balls : @xmath38    we can estimate the contribution of the gradient term to @xmath39 by using the gaussian approximation . recall that thick - walled q - balls have the profile : @xmath40 which means : @xmath41    looking at this equation , we see that the gradient term will make a contribution to the potential which is at maximum of order @xmath42 .",
    "since the energy per charge has the form : @xmath43 we expect the gradient energy to yield a contribution of order @xmath44 .",
    "we would like to know if this is significant on the scale of the expected binding energy per charge .",
    "even though the binding energy is formally infinite , we can still compare the characteristic scale of the binding energy with the characteristic scale of the gradient energy . in the thick - walled case",
    ", we expect that the potential will be dominated by the mass term .",
    "thus , we can estimate the binding energy per baryon as : @xmath45 this equation shows that although the binding energy is formally infinite , it has the characteristic magnitude @xmath44 ( we will assume that the log running is somehow regulated by higher - order effects ) .",
    "this implies that we can expect a binding energy per charge of at least a few times @xmath46 , and so the gradient energy of thick - walled q - balls is not too large to admit bound q - balls .",
    "these conclusions are borne out in numerical simulations . in @xcite q - balls",
    "are shown to form over a wide range of initial @xmath1 values ( many decades ) .",
    "so far we have only considered q - balls which follow a circular path in phase space ( @xmath47 is constant ) .",
    "as we shall see , this corresponds to a scalar field that is completely charge asymmetric ( all baryons or all anti - baryons ) .",
    "this is not a necessary condition for a strongly charged condensate , however . in @xcite",
    "it is seen that even condensates with considerable ellipticity in their phase space rotation will form q - balls that obey the same scaling relations as for completely charged condensates .",
    "this implies that elliptically rotating condensates can fracture into bound q - balls as well .",
    "we would like to examine the energetics of this process .",
    "the first step is to parameterize an elliptical condensate .",
    "recall our effective potential after the phase dependent terms have become unimportant is : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is basically arbitrary . as long as @xmath1 does not change more than an order of magnitude or so , the log corrections are essentially unimportant assuming small @xmath50 ( as we shall see , this is true for a condensate with significant charge ) .",
    "therefore we effectively have a @xmath51 potential .",
    "such a potential allows for closed orbits in the complex @xmath1 plane @xcite .",
    "we can parameterize such an orbit in the form : @xmath52    note that in keeping with our orbit analogy the analog of angular momentum in this case is @xmath53 which , by the noether current , is equal to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number density of excess baryons .",
    "conservation of angular momentum is guaranteed by the central force character of our potential ( even with logarithmic correction ) . plugging our parameterization into the noether current yields : @xmath56    we can now compare this number to the total number of @xmath1 particles that our condensate contains .",
    "this is approximated by taking the total energy density in the condensate , as given by equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) , and dividing by @xmath11 : @xmath57 it is now apparent that if we have a circular `` orbit '' the condensate is entirely composed of baryons ( or antibaryons ) . for elliptical orbits ,",
    "higher eccentricity means less net baryon fraction .",
    "now let us evaluate the energy per charge of an elliptical q - ball .",
    "we can make the analysis easier by picking a particular point along the trajectory .",
    "the simplest to use is when @xmath58 .",
    "using our small @xmath1 approximation for the potential and ignoring gradient terms for simplicity , we obtain : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the volume occupied by the q - ball .",
    "the charge of the q - ball will be @xmath61 where @xmath55 is given in equation ( [ eq : ellipchg ] ) .",
    "thus , we have an energy per charge : @xmath62 note that throughout this analysis we have ignored the running of the mass with @xmath1 .",
    "now we can see that this was justified .",
    "the characteristic contribution of the ellipticity to the energy per charge is of order @xmath11 , while the binding energy is characteristically of order @xmath44 .",
    "this is a serious concern . by comparing equation ( [ eq : problem ] ) to the result of equation ( [ eq : approxbe ] ) we can see that once @xmath63 is a few times greater than @xmath64 it would require the one - loop mass running to be valid over several orders of magnitude to yield a bound q - ball .",
    "in contrast , numerical simulations show that elliptical condensates can certainly form q - balls up to ratios @xmath65 , and possibly beyond @xcite .",
    "we can reconcile this apparent discrepancy by noting that the cause of the instability of q - balls with a large energy per net baryon is quantum mechanical decay .",
    "such decay is not treated in numerical simulations of the classical field .",
    "thus , our estimates would lead us to conclude that unless some way of damping out the ellipticity of a partially - charged ad condensate is present , we must question whether such condensates will truly form q - balls .",
    "one possibility for such damping is scalar self - interaction in a nonhomogeneous condensate .",
    "it is possible that this has already been observed in the numerical work of @xcite and simply not published .",
    "perhaps a more interesting possibility , however , is that in this case the problem is also the cure .",
    "a rotating scalar condensate need not decay only to free scalar particles .",
    "we anticipate couplings of the ad field to many other particle species . in this case",
    ", we would anticipate that a dense condensate could experience annihilations that remove the charge - neutral part while leaving behind the baryon asymmetry .",
    "this would effectively remove the excess energy per baryon .",
    "we have calculated the annihilations that would be mediated by an interaction term of the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is another scalar field .",
    "such an interaction would generically be present for a flat direction composed of squarks .",
    "our calculations show that the annihilations mediated by this interaction would reduce the ellipticity of the condensate dramatically on a time scale that is considerably less than the time scale for q - ball formation @xcite .",
    "so far in this section , we have summarized the evidence that a uniformly charged ad condensate is in a state that meets the criteria to be considered a bound q - ball immediately after beginning coherent oscillations about @xmath34 . on the strength of these arguments",
    ", we expect that by the time the universe is of the age @xmath68 the condensate is energetically ready to form q - balls .",
    "numerical simulations , however , show that the time of q - ball formation is more nearly of the order @xmath69 for @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is a result of the finite age of the universe ( or , equivalently , the expansion of the universe ) . in a matter dominated universe ,",
    "the maximum radius of a causally connected patch is @xmath71 thus , even if the scalar field would energetically prefer to form q - balls , the q - ball sized patches can not form a coherent object until @xmath72 .    for @xmath70 q - ball formation would then be causally allowed by @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we still have a large factor to make up . as we shall see",
    ", this is because the forces responsible for q - ball formation propagate at a characteristic sound speed rather than the speed of light .",
    "q - ball formation is the result of interactions in the fluid of squarks represented by the scalar condensate .",
    "such fluid interactions will have a sound speed associated with them .",
    "the sound speed in a completely charge - asymmetric scalar condensate is given in @xcite as : @xmath74 evaluating this using the effective potential of equation ( [ eq : bcpot ] ) gives the result that @xmath75 .",
    "it is important to note that because @xmath76 is negative , @xmath77 is technically imaginary .",
    "as we shall see , this will lead to the amplification of small perturbations .    to see this amplification ,",
    "consider the plane - wave solution to the wave equation : @xmath78 where for sound waves @xmath79 .",
    "now , consider the situation when @xmath80 is negative .",
    "we can construct a very similar solution , except that now we must take @xmath81 to be imaginary .",
    "thus , we anticipate solutions of the form : @xmath82    this solution yields growing modes which increase exponentially with e - folding time equal to : @xmath83 since a sound wave is constructed of small density fluctuations in the medium , this tells us that such fluctuations will grow exponentially .",
    "further , since the density of the medium is proportional to @xmath51 , we anticipate that small fluctuations in the field behave as @xmath84 .",
    "thus , to decide how fast perturbations on this scale will grow , we can use this diameter as half the wavelength in determining @xmath85 in the above equation .",
    "we have already calculated @xmath77 .",
    "combining these results with the results above gives : @xmath86 for @xmath87 , this evaluates to a characteristic time scale for the growth of q - ball - sized perturbations : @xmath88 further , since the numerical simulations of interest start off with perturbations suppressed by a factor of @xmath89 @xcite , we anticipate q - ball formation will require about 16 e - folding times .",
    "this yields exactly the relation found in the numerical simulations : @xmath90 calculating the total charge contained in the q - ball sized perturbation at this time , we find that : @xmath91 which compares very well with the results obtained on three - dimensional lattices in @xcite .    before we leave this section , we should comment that this analysis is only valid for imaginary values of the sound speed in q - matter .",
    "looking back at equation ( [ eq : vsound ] ) , this means that q - ball formation will require : @xmath92 this condition can be restated using the equation of motion for @xmath93 . from this",
    ", we can see that the phase rotation rate @xmath47 for a completely charge - asymmetric condensate is given by @xcite : @xmath94 thus , we can rewrite our condition for q - balls : @xmath95 which is precisely the condition for q - ball formation in a completely charge - asymmetric condensate arrived at in @xcite using the equations of motion for @xmath93 and @xmath47 .",
    "for condensates with little or no net charge , we expect that breakup into q - balls must follow a different path than for strongly charged condensates . the only way to form q - balls is to somehow separate the neutral condensate into positive and negatively charged regions .",
    "this is observed to happen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we wish to try to understand this process analytically .",
    "in one of the early papers on q - balls in gravity - mediated ad scenarios , it was assumed that q - ball formation was due to negative pressure in the ad condensate @xcite .",
    "for the case of a real ( non - complex ) scalar field , negative pressure condensates result from the negative value of @xmath76 in the one - loop corrected scalar potential ( see equation ( [ eq : qballv ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "we wish to explicitly consider the pressure arising for a charged ( complex ) scalar .",
    "it is important to note that in this section we will have to be careful to retain terms of order @xmath50 in the expressions we are about to derive .",
    "these small corrections will be responsible for any pressure that we find .",
    "the first such correction to take note of is that when we parameterize our rotating condensate in the form of an ellipse , we must use the more general form : @xmath96 where to first order in @xmath50 , @xmath47 is given by : @xmath97 ( this result follows from the equation of motion . ) note that for a treatment of `` weakly charged '' condensates we are interested in @xmath98 .    with this form in hand",
    ", we can move on to explicitly calculate the pressure . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for a rapidly ( relative to the hubble time ) oscillating condensate , the average pressure can be written in terms of the energy density through the use of the parameter : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the pressure , @xmath101 is the energy density , and @xmath102 is the period of the oscillation . in terms of @xmath103 , we would have the relationship between average pressure and energy density : @xmath104    to evaluate this expression for our charged condensate we must use the energy - momentum tensor for a complex scalar : @xmath105 which tells us : @xmath106 and : @xmath107    these , along with the generic elliptical parameterization of equation ( [ eq : paramom ] ) , yield the expressions : @xmath108 and : @xmath109    now , assuming that @xmath101 changes very little over the course of one oscillation , we can write : @xmath110 this expression can be numerically integrated . doing so for various values of @xmath111 and @xmath76 yields the curve shown in figure [ fig : gam ] .",
    "the feature of current interest is the intercept at @xmath112 , which is consistently equal to @xmath113 .    with this result",
    "we see that the analysis of @xcite is essentially correct .",
    "the pressure of a weakly charged ad condensate is expected to be negative , with @xmath114 .",
    "note , however , that we have made something of an approximation in our parameterization of the ad condensate as a perfect ellipse .",
    "a study of `` true '' ad condensates obtained via numerical integration of the classical equations of motion shows that the numerical treatment for the idealized elliptical trajectory is accurate to within a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , we have settled on @xmath116 as a reasonable first approximation to the pressure .",
    "note also that this is the result obtained using the polynomial approximation of @xcite .",
    "we can now follow @xcite to see that perturbations in even a perfectly charge - symmetric ad condensate will grow exponentially .",
    "in fact , since the factor @xmath117 is identical to the sound speed @xmath77 found for a strongly charged condensate , the exponential growth will occur with the same timescale as the growth of perturbations in a strongly charge - asymmetric condensate .",
    "the negative pressure of the condensate can serve to give us growing q - ball sized perturbations .",
    "the next question , however , is how these regions can acquire a charge asymmetry .",
    "the dynamics of such a process are beyond a simple perturbative analysis .",
    "we can , however , do some back of the envelope calculations to guess at the charges we could expect .    consider two overdense q - ball - sized perturbations that have evolved `` next to '' one another .",
    "we will consider the epoch when these perturbations have just gone nonlinear , so @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the average energy density in the scalar field and @xmath120 is the peak energy density in the perturbation .",
    "the perturbations will be separated by an underdense region of approximately q - ball size .",
    "we must assume that they have interacted in such a way as to impart on one another a very weak rotation . by conservation of baryon number we know one will have a rotation corresponding to positive baryon asymmetry and the other will carry negative baryon asymmetry .",
    "we now wish to show that this weak rotation is enough to cause the positive perturbation to preferentially accrete baryons as it grows , while the negative perturbation will preferentially accrete anti - baryons .",
    "thus the charge asymmetries will be enhanced , eventually yielding a q - ball / anti - q - ball pair .",
    "consider a tiny box ( side length @xmath121 ) filled with baryons that lies on the line joining the two perturbations .",
    "imagine that it is closer to the center of the negative perturbation .",
    "we can calculate work required to remove this box from the negative perturbation",
    ". the work will be : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the distance between the center of the negative perturbation and the small box to begin with , and @xmath124 is the pressure difference between the leading edge and the trailing edge of the box , given approximately by @xmath125 so , using the results of the previous section : @xmath126    we want to compare this work with the energy difference that we would expect to see if the box of baryons left the negative perturbation and joined the positive perturbation .",
    "we can estimate this by considering the perturbations to be highly elliptical q - balls .",
    "thus , we expect that the perturbations contain net baryon number @xmath127 equal to ( see equation ( [ eq : smchgn ] ) ) : @xmath128 where the minus denotes the negative perturbation and @xmath129 is the volume of the perturbation .",
    "similarly , each perturbation has an energy ( see equation ( [ eq : smchgen ] ) ) : @xmath130 where in each of these formulas , we expect @xmath131 .    adding the box of baryons to either perturbation",
    "implies a change in both the total baryon asymmetry and the energy . for the net baryon number",
    ", we have : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the energy density within the small box , and we have differentiated @xmath127 given above .",
    "the energy relation is : @xmath134    we can solve these equations simultaneously to obtain : @xmath135 for the positive perturbation , while for the negative perturbation we would have : @xmath136    we have solved for these by explicitly assuming the energy contribution of the box of baryons is the same for each perturbation . to zeroth order in @xmath76",
    "we expect this to be the case , as there is no attractive force present .",
    "once we `` turn on '' @xmath76 , however , we do expect to see an attraction between baryons .",
    "we can estimate this attraction by using our zeroth order solutions for @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the first order expression for energy . from equation ( [ eq : realenden ] ) we can see :",
    "@xmath139 where `` like '' denotes the energy of a positive perturbation with the positive box of baryons or of a negative perturbation with a negative box , and `` unlike '' represents the other two possibilities .",
    "thus we see that at first order in @xmath76 the energy of the box is lower when it is within the positive q - ball than when it is within the negative q - ball .",
    "this energy difference can provide the work needed to separate the negative charges from the growing positive perturbation and vice - versa .",
    "we will now make a very rough estimate of the amount of charge separation that will occur in the formation of a perturbation from a weakly charged condensate .    in the simplest picture , we are forming spherical perturbations with radius @xmath18 ( approximately @xmath140 ) which are separated from one another by voids of about @xmath141 in width .",
    "thus , each perturbation has a sphere of influence that extends a radius @xmath141 from its center .",
    "theoretically it will gather up all the matter in this sphere to create the final perturbation .",
    "we will now assume that we have a pair of oppositely charged perturbations next to one another .",
    "now in the region between these , the baryons will be preferentially attracted to the positive perturbation , while the antibaryons will be preferentially attracted to the negative one .",
    "thus , we will somewhat arbitrarily define an extended sphere of influence for these charged q - balls of radius @xmath142 . in the overlap region of these extended spheres , we will assume that the charges separate completely and collect in their energetically preferred q - ball .    to determine the final charge , then , we are interested in the ratio of this overlap volume to that of the complete @xmath141 sphere of influence .",
    "a quick calculation shows that the ratio in question is approximately 1/10 .",
    "thus , we expect a final charge fraction in the q - ball of 1/10 the value that a q - ball formed in a completely charge asymmetric condensate of the same initial @xmath93 value would have .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that strongly charged condensates can easily break up into bound q - balls .",
    "it is clear from a simple analysis , however , that any significant ellipticity in the phase rotation of the condensate might compromise this binding by making the energy per charge larger than that in a free scalar plasma .",
    "this concern leads us to believe that damping of this ellipticity is important for q - ball formation .",
    "this has been considered in a separate work @xcite .",
    "( note added : after publication of this paper , i was informed that the delayed decay of affleck - dine condensates has also been considered in @xcite . )    assuming that strongly charged condensates can reach a nearly circular rotational state , we recover the known result @xcite that breakup will occur . by considering the sound speed in the scalar condensate",
    ", we have shown that the time scales for breakup observed in numerical simulations @xcite are reproduced in a simple analytical treatment .",
    "given the results of @xcite we expect these `` strongly charged '' results to be useful for condensates with @xmath143 as high as @xmath144 .",
    "for condensates with even larger @xmath143 ratios , we have shown that the negative pressure of the condensate @xcite can still allow for the growth of seed perturbations .",
    "this , coupled with the weak attractive force between baryons can lead to q - ball / anti - q - ball pairs ."
