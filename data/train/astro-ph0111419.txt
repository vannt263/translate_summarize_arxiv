    "_ asca _ found that the @xmath0 fluorescent emission line in seyfert  1 galaxies is often very broad , and this is generally interpreted as the result of an origin in matter in an accretion disk rotating around a central black hole ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the line profile is thought to be sculpted by characteristic gravitational and doppler energy shifts . currently , study of the @xmath0 emission line is the only way to probe matter within a few to tens of gravitational radii in supermassive black holes .",
    "indeed , the broad @xmath0 lines provide some of the strongest evidence to date for the existence of black holes .",
    "it has been known since the early days of _ asca _ that the @xmath0 line in agn is not always tremendously broad ( e.g. @xcite ) and that the profile comes in a variety of shapes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been known that seyfert type 1.92.0 galaxies have a predominantly narrow @xmath0 line , with fwhm less than @xmath2 km / s , probably originating in cold matter far from the black hole ( e.g. ngc 2992 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was apparent that many seyfert 1.51.9 galaxies likely have composite narrow and broad @xmath0 line components ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have now shown that composite narrow and broad @xmath0 lines are common even in seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "1 ( from @xcite ) shows the narrow line in the _ chandra _ hetg data for ngc  5548 , compared to non - contemporaneous _ asca _ data showing the overall , broad @xmath0 line profile .",
    "2 shows a montage of more measurements of the @xmath0 narrow - line component in type  1 agn , again compared with non - contemporaneous _ asca _ measurements . note that _ chandra _ does nt always clearly detect the broad component of the line",
    "this is not surprising since the effective area of hetg in the fe - k band is so small . _",
    "the hetg data do not in any case reject the corresponding broad line measured by _",
    "asca _ _ . also note that _ chandra _ _ does _ detect a broad feature in ngc  4051 , f9 , and ngc  4151 ( for the latter see weaver & yaqoob , these proceedings ) . of course we do need simultaneous measurements with instruments that can measure both the narrow and broad components and we have a program to do this with _",
    "chandra _ and _ rxte _ ( some with _ xmm - newton _ ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the narrow lines ( nl ) range from tens of ev to over a 100 ev in some cases . in all type  1 agn studied by _",
    "hetg _ so far ( excluding nls1 ) , the narrow line appears to originate in cold matter , with its center energy around 6.4 kev . only in one case (",
    "ngc  3783 ; @xcite ) is the narrow @xmath0 line resolved ( in ngc  5548 it was marginally resolved @xcite ) . in that case",
    "its location is somewhere in between the blr and nlr . in all the other cases ,",
    "upper limits on the fwhm are @xmath3 km / s",
    ". its location could be any one or more of : blr , nlr , obscuring torus , or even the outer regions of the accretion disk .",
    "the latter is possible because _ we do not actually know the distribution of @xmath0 line emissivity over the disk_. the distribution may be flatter than @xmath4 and need not even be a power - law .",
    "for example , if the disk is illuminated by a distribution of magnetic flares all over the surface then the line emissivity could be very flat with radius .",
    "it may then appear that there is a separate nl , when in fact the disk is producing both the nl _ and _ the broad line ( bl ) .",
    "if the spatial distribution of flares varies with time , the nl will appear to vary .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "2 shows that a narrow @xmath0 line is detected in one observation of 3c  273 but not in another observation which has the same continuum luminosity .",
    "this strongly argues for a disk origin of the narrow line in 3c  273 .",
    "a program is under - way to retroactively re - interpret previous measurements of the @xmath0 line profiles and variability for as many agn as possible , in the light of new _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ results .",
    "recently lubiski and zdziarski ( @xcite hereafter lz01 ) have claimed that the @xmath0 lines in agn are _ systematically _ narrower and weaker ( smaller equivalent width , or ew ) than had previously been thought .",
    "they speculated that this result can be attributed to changes in the calibration of the _ asca _ instruments .",
    "specifically , lz01 refer to the calibration used by tanaka _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 @xcite ( hereafter t95 ) and nandra _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 @xcite ( hereafter n97 ) and that used in the tartarus agn database .",
    "we call the t95 and n97 calibration ` old ' and the tartarus calibration ` current '",
    "3 compares the @xmath0 line profiles for mcg  @xmath56@xmath530@xmath515 using the actual data and calibration files used by t95 @xcite and tartarus .",
    "a similar comparison is shown for 3c  120 in fig .",
    "4 but this time calibration effects are isolated by using the same spectral files but constructing old and current calibration for them .",
    "detailed spectral fit results and technical details on the different calibrations can be found in @xcite .",
    "now these observations of mcg  @xmath56@xmath530@xmath515 and 3c  120 have much higher signal - to - noise than typical @xmath6 day _ asca _ observations ( which constitute the lz01 sample ) , yet the calibration effects on the @xmath0 line are small .",
    "in fact simulations show that the current calibration reduces the ew and intrinsic width by only @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , all of the observations considered by lz01 were made before radiation damage made a significant impact on the ccds .",
    "therefore the principal differences between the old and current calibration for these early data are , ( 1 ) improvements in the sis response matrix , ( 2 ) multiplicative , energy - dependent corrections for the effective area ( the so - called ` arf filter ' ) , and ( 3 ) changes in the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) ray - tracing ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the latter is the _ only _ change that can make the old and current calibration have different effects on different observations since the first two are independent of position on the detector and independent of time of the observation ( as long as that time is early enough in the mission ) .",
    "even the change in xrt response is a smooth function of source off - axis angle , and its variation is small given the limited range of off - axis angles in observations .",
    "_ changes in calibration can not therefore produce wild differences in the @xmath0 lines in some sources and small differences in others as lz01 claim . _",
    "if one examines the @xmath0 line profiles for the type  1 agn in lz01 which do give wildly different line widths compared to n97 , one finds that the lines claimed to be narrowest by lz01 are in fact some of the broadest .",
    "however , the lines are can be complex and can not always be modeled by single gaussians , so the lz01 spectral fits could model the narrow line core only , grossly underestimating the width and ew .",
    "ngc  4151 has been observed by _",
    "asca _ several times .",
    "an unprecedented ao8 @xmath7 day observation in may 2000 ( exposure @xmath8  ks ) yielded an @xmath0 line profile with _ the highest signal - to - noise _ for any agn in the entire _ asca _ archive .",
    "the 57 kev band in the _ asca _ sis0 ao8 ngc  4151 data contains @xmath9 times more photons ( in total ) than mcg  @xmath56@xmath530@xmath515 .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the result of fitting the 0.610 kev _ asca _ ao8 ( sis0 ) data for ngc  4151 with two different complex continuum models ( power law plus a dual cold absorber and a warm absorber , as well as a thermal emission component ) and double gaussians for the @xmath0 line . it can be seen that the resulting @xmath0 line profile is hardly sensitive to the precise form of the continuum . in fact",
    "even if we fit the 310 kev band only with a simple single absorber ( plus power - law ) , the @xmath0 line profile is not substantially affected .",
    "it is also important to note that _ the relative strength of the red wing is variable _ in general : this has been known for mcg  @xmath56@xmath530@xmath515 for some time .",
    "the ao8 data clearly show this for ngc  4151 but that work will be presented elsewhere . in any case",
    ", we should not be surprised , if during a particular observation of ngc  4151 the red wing appears to be weak .",
    "the statistical quality of the _ asca _ ao8 data is good enough to reject claims that the broad @xmath0 line in ngc  4151 is really the result of a thick absorber mimicking the broad line . considering a spectral fit to the sis0 data in the 0.610 kev range with a power law plus warm absorber , thin thermal continuum , narrow @xmath0 line , plus a very thick , partially covering , absorber , to model the apparent broad red wing of the @xmath0 line",
    ", we obtain a poor fit .",
    "compared to a similar model with the thick absorber replaced by a broad gaussian the difference in @xmath10 for the thick absorber model compared to the broad line model is 43 , rejecting the former model at an extremely high level of confidence . the d.o.f .",
    "for the two models are equal because the thick absorber model has free covering factor and photon index .    19    fabian , a. c. , _ et al .",
