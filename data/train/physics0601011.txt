    "there is ample paleomagnetic evidence that the axial dipole component of the earth s magnetic field has reversed its polarity many times .",
    "the last reversal , the brunhes - matuyama transition , occurred approximately 780000 years ago .",
    "the mean rate of reversals varies from nearly zero during the kiaman and cretaceous superchrons to approximately 5 per myr in the present .",
    "some observations suggest a pronounced _ asymmetry _ of reversals with the decay of the dipole of a given polarity being much slower than the following recreation of the dipole with opposite polarity @xcite .",
    "observational data also indicate a possible _ correlation _ of the field intensity with the interval between subsequent reversals @xcite .",
    "a third hypothesis concerns the _ bimodal distribution _ of the earth s virtual axial dipole moment ( vadm ) with two peaks at approximately 4 @xmath1 10@xmath2 am@xmath3 and at twice that value @xcite .",
    "although these reversal features are still controversially discussed in the literature , it is worthwhile to ask if and how they could be represented within geodynamo theory . with view on the recent dynamo experiments in riga and karlsruhe @xcite",
    "one could also ask about the most essential ingredient for a dynamo experiment to exhibit irregular reversals in a similar way as the geodynamo does .    = . with higher values of @xmath4 , the field amplitude increases and the oscillation frequency decreases .",
    "note also the growing anharmonicity ( saw - tooth shape ) of the oscillations and the transition to a non - oscillatory regime ( as seen for @xmath5).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in a recent paper @xcite we had shown that a simple mean - field dynamo model with a spherically symmetric helical turbulence parameter @xmath0 can exhibit all three mentioned features of reversals .",
    "interestingly , all of them are attributable to the magnetic field dynamics in the vicinity of an _ exceptional point _",
    "@xcite of the spectrum of the non - selfadjoint dynamo operator where two real eigenvalues coalesce and continue as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "typically , this exceptional point is associated with a nearby local maximum of the growth rate dependence on the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "it is the negative slope of this curve between the local maximum and the exceptional point that makes even stationary dynamos vulnerable to some prevailing noise .",
    "this way , the system can leave the stable state and run towards the exceptional point and beyond into the oscillatory branch where the polarity transition occurs .",
    "a weakness of this reversal model was the apparent necessity to fine - tune the magnetic reynolds number and/or the radial profile @xmath6 in order to adjust the operator spectrum in an appropriate way . in a follow - up paper",
    "@xcite it was shown , however , that this fine - tuning is not necessary in the case of _ higher supercriticality _ of the dynamo .",
    "it turned out that for increasing magnetic reynolds number there is a strong tendency for the exceptional point and the associated local maximum to move close to the zero growth rate line were the indicated reversal scenario can be actualized .",
    "although exemplified by the simple spherically symmetric @xmath7 dynamo model , the main idea of this  self - tuning  mechanism of saturated dynamos into a reversal - prone state seems transferable to other dynamos .",
    "hence , reversing dynamos might be much more typical than what could be expected from a purely kinematic perspective .    in the present paper",
    "we go one step further and compare paleomagnetic data of five reversals from the last two million years with numerical time series resulting from our model .",

    "the critical dynamo number is 6.78 .",
    "the nearly harmonic oscillation for @xmath46 becomes more and more saw - tooth shaped for increasing @xmath4 , with a pronounced asymmetry between the slow field decay and the fast field recreation during the reversal . at @xmath5",
    "a transition to a steady dynamo has occurred .    in order to understand this behaviour",

    "2 the evolution of the magnetic field within approximately half a period of the anharmonic oscillation for the particular value @xmath47 at which the saw - tooth shape is already very pronounced .",
    "figure 2a shows the time dependence of @xmath48 during this half period , with the typical slow decay and the fast recreation of the field .",
    "this behaviour is analyzed in detail at 9 selected instants @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) for which the instantaneous fields @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "2d ) and the corresponding @xmath17 ( fig . 2e , 2f ) are depicted .",
    "the latter two plots reveal that @xmath6 undergoes only slight changes during the oscillation and that it comes very close to the unquenched , kinematic @xmath37 ( denoted by k ) when the magnetic field is small in the middle of the reversal .",
    "it is instructive to plug the instantaneous @xmath17 profiles into an eigenvalue solver ( for which the time derivatives on the left hand sides of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are replaced by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ) .",
    "figure 2b and fig .",
    "2c show the resulting instantaneous growth rates and frequencies during the half - oscillation .",
    "evidently , the reversal starts with a very slow field decay ( slightly negative growth rate ) which , however , accelerates itself and drives the system into an oscillatory behaviour ( the frequency becomes different from zero for @xmath51 ) . around @xmath52 , when the quenching of @xmath0 is weak , the instantaneous growth rate reaches rather high values .",
    "later we will see that for strongly supercritical dynamos these high growth rates result in a field dynamics that is much faster than what would be expected from the diffusion time scale .",
    "in figure 3a we relate this magnetic field evolution to the existence of exceptional points of the spectrum .",
    "it shows the instantaneous growth rate which results from the individual @xmath17 profiles , and from the unquenched ( kinematic ) @xmath6 profile k. in addition to the growth rates at the actual dynamo number @xmath47 ( indicated by the dashed vertical line ) , we have plotted the whole growth rate curves in the interval between @xmath53 . at the exceptional point e@xmath54 of the kinematic @xmath37 , the first eigenvalue branch k1 coalesces with the second branch k2 and both continue as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "for all other curves , only the exceptional point is indicated by @xmath32 whereas the branch of the second eigenvalue has been omitted . in this framework",
    ", a reversal can be described as follows : at the instant 1 , the growth rate is located close to the maximum of the non - oscillatory branch which is slightly below zero .",
    "the resulting slow field decay accelerates itself , because the system moves down ( instant 2 ) from the maximum of the real branch towards the exceptional point .",
    "then the system enters the oscillatory branch ( 3 - 7 ) .",
    "finally the system moves back again ( 8,9 ) but with opposite polarity .",
    "the transition point between oscillatory and steady dynamos ( @xmath55 ) is characterized by the fact that the maximum of the non - oscillatory branch crosses the zero growth rate line . beyond this point ,",
    "the field is growing rather than decaying , leading to a stable fixed point somewhere to the left of the maximum of the non - oscillatory branch , and hence to a non - oscillatory dynamo ( cf .",
    "the case @xmath5 in fig .",
    "1 ) . if noise comes into play it will soften the sharp border between oscillatory and steady dynamos .",
    "this means , in particular , that even above the transition point , the noise can trigger a jump to the right of the maximum from were the described reversal process can start ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    = and @xmath44 .",
    "the time interval includes 80 kyr before ( negative values ) and 20 kyr after ( positive values ) a polarity transition .",
    "note the quite different time scales for @xmath56 on one side , and for the other three examples on the other side.,title=\"fig : \" ]    having identified the exceptional point and the nearby local maximum as the spectral features that are responsible for both the slow decay before and the fast recreation of the field after the polarity transition , one may ask now why the operator of the actual geodynamo should possess just such a special spectrum .    a preliminary answer to this question",
    "was given in @xcite and is illustrated in fig .",
    "3b . roughly speaking ,",
    "highly supercritical dynamos seem to have a tendency to saturate in a state for which the exceptional point and its associated local maximum lie close to the zero growth rate line .",
    "interestingly , this happens independently on whether the exceptional point in the original kinematic case was above the zero growth rate line or below it .",
    "our example with @xmath35 belongs to the second type .",
    "starting from the kinematic @xmath37 , for which the exceptional point is well below the zero line , it rises rapidly above zero to a maximum value , but for even higher @xmath4 it moves back in direction to the zero line .    without noise and for @xmath57 ,",
    "the position of the local maximum above the zero growth rate line leads to a steady dynamo .",
    "the presence of noise will sometimes bring the actual growth rate below zero , and then the indicated reversal process can start . a number of time series for different values of @xmath4 and @xmath44 is depicted in fig .",
    "4 .    figure 5 shows reversal details for four particular choices of @xmath4 and @xmath44 . for later comparison with paleomagnetic data we have exhibited five typical reversals , and their averages , from 80 kyr before the polarity transition until 20 kyr after ( except the case @xmath56 for which the reversal takes much longer ) .",
    "in this section we will validate if our model can be fitted to real paleomagnetic data . for this purpose",
    "we have used recently published material about five reversals which occurred during the last two million years @xcite . actually , the data shown in fig .",
    "6a have been extracted from fig .",
    "4 of @xcite . in all five curves , as well as in their averages , the asymmetry of the reversal process is clearly visible .",
    "the dominant features are a field decay over a period of 50 - 80 kyr and a rather sharp field recreation within 5 - 10 kyr .",
    "it has been an old - standing puzzle to explain in particular this fast recreation when a diffusive timescale of 200 kyr has to be taken into account .",
    "a possible solution of this problem is to assume a turbulent resistivity which is much larger than the molecular resistivity ( e.g. , by a factor 15 - 20 in @xcite ) .    the comparison of the real data with the numerically time series in fig .",
    "6b shows that this assumption of turbulent resistivity is by no means necessary .",
    "apart from the slightly supercritical case @xmath56 which exhibits a much to slow magnetic field evolution , the other examples with @xmath3420 , 50 , 100 and @xmath58 show very realistic time series with the typical slow decay and fast recreation . as noted above , the fast recreation results from the fact that in a small intervall during the transition the dynamo operates with an nearly unquenched @xmath6 profiles which yields , in case that the dynamo is strongly supercritical , rather high growth rates .",
    "based on former results in @xcite and @xcite , we have shown that a simple but strongly supercritical @xmath7 dynamo model exhibits a number of features which are typical for earth s magnetic field reversals , in particular an asymmetric shape and correct timescales for the field decay and field recreation .    as it does not include the necessary north - south asymmetry of @xmath0 we can not claim that our model is an appropriate model of the geodynamo .",
    "however , recent papers by giesecke et al . have shown that a ) even in such realistic models @xmath0 may exhibit a sign change along the radius @xcite and b ) that such models can also give rise to reversals @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems worthwhile to identify the indicated reversal scenario in this and in more complicated geodynamo models .",
