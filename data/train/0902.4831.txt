    "the experimental measurements present that the charmful and charmless three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays have the same features .",
    "first , the threshold effect is observed in @xmath4 @xcite , where a curve peaks near the threshold area in the dibaryon invariant mass spectrum .",
    "this phenomenon found in all charmless cases can be understood in terms of a simple short - distance picture @xcite .",
    "particularly , this picture has been used to realize why charmless three - body decays @xcite have rates larger than charmless two - body decays @xcite ; that is , @xmath9 .",
    "one energetic @xmath10 pair must be emitted back to back by a hard gluon in order to produce a baryon and an antibaryon in the two - body decay .",
    "this hard gluon is highly off mass shell and hence the two - body decay amplitude is suppressed by order of @xmath11 . in the three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays , a possible configuration is that the @xmath12 pair is emitted collinearly against the meson .",
    "the quark and antiquark pair emitted from a gluon is moving nearly in the same direction .",
    "since this gluon is close to its mass shell , the corresponding configuration is not subject to the short - distance suppression .",
    "this implies that the dibaryon pair tends to have a small invariant mass @xcite .",
    "second , the dalitz plot of @xmath13 @xcite with asymmetric distributions signals a nonzero angular distribution asymmetry as measured in @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , while the above - mentioned short - distance picture predicts a correct angular distribution pattern for the decays @xmath19 , @xmath15 , and @xmath20 , it fails to explain the angular correlation observed in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the intuitive argument that the @xmath21 in the @xmath22 rest frame is expected to emerge parallel to @xmath23 is not borne out by experiment @xcite .",
    "likewise , the naive argument that the pion has no preference for its correlation with the @xmath24 or the @xmath25 in the decay @xmath18 is ruled out by the new belle experiment @xcite in which a strong correlation between the @xmath24 and the pion is seen .",
    "therefore , the study of the charmful baryonic @xmath0 decays @xmath26 may help improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism for the threshold enhancement and the angular distribution in three - body decays .",
    "we shall therefore focus on @xmath27 with @xmath28 or @xmath2 to see if we can explain the branching fractions .",
    "[ table1 ]    the branching fractions of the charmful baryonic @xmath29 decays are summarized in table [ table1 ] , where @xmath30 was first observed by cleo in 2001 @xcite .",
    "note that the decays @xmath31 and @xmath32 have similar results in rates .",
    "the nonobservation of @xmath33 is due to the fact that it proceeds via @xmath34 at the quark level .",
    "this leads to a suppression of @xmath35 compared to its neutral partner .",
    "likewise , it is expected that @xmath36 , consistent with the experimental upper bound for this decay mode . as for the rate difference between @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", it has to do with the baryonic form factors , which we are going to elaborate on later .",
    "to have the amplitudes , we shall adopt the generalized factorization approach @xcite , which has been well applied to the study of three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays @xcite .",
    "decay process : ( a ) current type and ( b ) transition type.,width=268 ]    under the factorization approximation , the decay amplitudes can be classified into three different categories : the current - type ( class - i ) , the transition - type ( class - ii ) , and the hybrid - type ( class - iii ) amplitudes .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath30 is the class - i current - type which proceed via a color - allowed , external @xmath39-emission diagram as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig](a ) , which is given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 to be specified later .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath4 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the class - ii transition - type via the color - suppressed internal @xmath39 emission diagram [ fig . [ fig](b ) ] .",
    "the amplitudes read @xmath45 with @xmath46 to be given later , where @xmath29 could be @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath44 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",

    "however , since we assume su(3 ) flavor symmetry , we can neglect these two form factors as they vanish for conserved currents .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of form factors is governed by the pqcd counting rules @xcite . in the large @xmath61 limit , the momentum dependence of the form factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 behaves as @xmath64 as there are two hard gluon exchanges between the valence quarks .",

    "since three gluons are needed to induce the @xmath85 transition , two for producing the baryon pair and one for kicking the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson , the pqcd counting rules imply that to the leading order @xmath86 just as the previous case for vacuum to the dibaryon transition , under the su(3 ) flavor and @xmath87 spin symmetries , the parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be expressed in terms of the reduced parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94",
