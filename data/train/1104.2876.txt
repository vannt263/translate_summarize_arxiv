    "understanding the possibility to exchange ch@xmath1 with co@xmath0 in hydrates is of great importance to the oil industry , and has been the focus of several studies @xcite . by studying the radial distribution function of a fully occupied si hydrate using molecular dynamic simulations , geng et al @xcite",
    "have recently suggested that a co@xmath0 + ch@xmath1 mixture in the hydrate lattice can be more stable than a hydrate with pure components , ch@xmath1 or co@xmath0 .",
    "the present work aims to find conditions for which this is true , using grand - canonical monte - carlo simulations ( gcmc ) in the study of the adsorption of pure co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 , as well as mixtures of co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 in an si hydrate .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of this type are excellently suited for this purpose , because they allow one to study also metastable configurations , in particular , non - fully occupied hydrates @xcite . molecular simulations allows one to study the conditions of hydrate formation which are complicated to work with experimentally . for a particular configuration of a hydrate with adsorbed gas(es )",
    "one can use the adsorption isotherms to obtain the helmholtz energy , which can be used to give information about relative stabilities .",
    "gcmc simulations have been used extensively to study adsorption processes @xcite and we shall take advantage of the method development described earlier @xcite .",
    "we shall use the chlatrate si structure , which forms at typical reservoir conditions ( for example , pressures up to @xmath4 bar or @xmath5 pa , which corresponds to reservoir depths up to 10 km @xcite ) .",
    "the structure , which is well established @xcite , has 8 cages per unit cell .",
    "interaction potentials for water are available through a series of systematic investigations @xcite .",
    "we will use a rigid water model and the rigid framework model for all of the calculations .",
    "the typical behavior of the adsorption isotherms remain essentially unaltered when the hydrate framework model becomes mobile ( and therefore is not presented here ) .",
    "the helmholtz energy difference is negative for a spontaneous process at constant volume and temperature .",
    "the process of practical interest in this study can be written schematically as the reaction @xmath6 the helmholtz energy difference per mole of formed unit cell in this reaction is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the long - term aim of the work is to obtain the values for @xmath7 which would decide on whether the hydrate formation is favorable or not .",
    "this paper concerns a first step in this direction .",
    "we will study the variation in the helmholtz energy of the hydrate with a mixed gas adsorbed , @xmath8 , compared to a metastable hydrate with empty cages @xmath9 .",
    "this difference is denoted by @xmath10 in this paper . since",
    ", adding a gas molecule in a cage stabilizes the hydrate , this helmholtz energy difference will normally decrease with the loading .",
    "however , if a gas hydrate with two components adsorbed is less stable than a single component one , the variation in the helmholtz energy would also increase with loading .",
    "the main purpose of the paper is to show this , and discuss how this process can be understood in terms of molecular behavior .",
    "the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath10 are related , but we return to the relationship and a discussion of @xmath7 in a subsequent paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : thermodynamics ] we discuss the basic thermodynamic relations which allow us to calculate the helmholtz energy and the molar heat of adsorption as a function of loading .",
    "the details of the simulations are specified in [ sec / simulations ] . in [ sec / results ]",
    "we provide our results .",
    "we report adsorption isotherms for the single component hydrates and the mixture of co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 in the hydrate , as well as the selectivity data for the mixture adsorption .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the helmholtz energy difference @xmath10 of the above hydrates as a function of loading . finally , we compare the data for the molar heat of adsorption with the structure of the hydrates .",
    "an overall discussion and conclusion are given in [ sec / conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the framework of water molecules in the si clathrate structure . in simulations we can control whether this framework is flexible or rigid . in both cases we specify and keep fixed the lattice parameters of the framework ,",
    "so the volume of the system @xmath11 is constant .",
    "we also keep the temperature of the system @xmath12 fixed .",
    "the helmholtz energy @xmath13 of the clathrate with given numbers of adsorbed guest molecules ( a loading ) is given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the pressure in the system , @xmath16 is the chemical potential of the @xmath17-th guest component and @xmath18 is the number of adsorbed molecules of component @xmath17 , while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the corresponding quantities for water .",
    "the number of compounds is @xmath21 . for pure components , @xmath22 , for a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide @xmath23 .",
    "the number of water molecules is fixed , while the number of guest molecules vary .",
    "the chemical potentials , and therefore the helmholtz energy , depend on the loading .",
    "we would like to calculate @xmath24 , the difference in the helmholtz energy of a filled clathrate @xmath25 and the helmholtz energy of the empty clathrate @xmath26 .",
    "we refer to this difference as the _ helmholtz energy of the mixture of gases in the hydrate_. it follows from [ eq / freeenergy/01 ] that @xmath27v + \\left[\\mu_{w}(n_{\\{i\\}})-\\mu_{w}(0)\\right]n_{w } + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\mu_{i}(n_{\\{i\\}})\\,n_{i}}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the hydrostatic pressure at the given volume and loading , while @xmath29 is the hydrostatic pressure at the same volume and zero loading .",
    "according to the gibbs - duhem relation we have @xmath30 integrating the equation at a constant temperature , volume , and a constant number of water molecules from zero loading to a given loading we obtain @xmath31 + n_{w}\\left[\\mu_{w}(n_{\\{i\\}})-\\mu_{w}(0)\\right ] + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\int_{0}^{\\mu_{i}^*(n_{\\{i\\}})}n_{i}\\,d\\mu_{i}(n_{\\{i\\ } } ) } = 0\\ ] ] which , after substitution into [ eq / freeenergy/03 ] and integration by parts , gives @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the specified chemical potential of each of the component . the right hand side of this expression can be easily obtained from gcmc simulations , in which one specifies the chemical potential of the adsorbing components and measures the number of adsorbed molecules .",
    "furthermore , this form is convenient for integration , because at low loadings the slope of the function @xmath34 approaches zero .",
    "the integration in [ eq / freeenergy/06 ] over the chemical potential of one component is done by keeping the chemical potentials of all other components fixed . for a two - component system",
    "this means that integration is performed first along the path of @xmath35 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 and then along the path @xmath37 from @xmath35 to @xmath38 .",
    "the chemical potential of the @xmath17-th component directly follows from its fugacity @xmath39 @xcite : @xmath40 where the first term in [ eq / freeenergy/07 ] is the contribution from the ideal gas . here",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 is the partition function for internal degrees of freedom . if the molecules are rigid ( which is the case for our simulations , see [ sec / simulations ] ) , @xmath42 has contributions only from rotation of the molecule . at high temperature @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the characteristic temperature of the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , @xmath45 is the thermal de brogile wavelength of component @xmath17 , @xmath46 is the molar mass , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are plank s constant , avogadro s number , the universal gas constant , and boltzman s constant , respectively .",
    "the heat of adsorption of gas(es ) into the hydrate at constant volume is equal to the internal energy change of the reaction at constant volume . from the internal energy of reaction",
    ", we define the partial molar energy for adsorption of a component @xmath17 ; @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the internal energy of the hydrate phase and @xmath53 is the corresponding value for the gas phase . for a guest molecule in the hydrate ,",
    "both energies have constant contributions from the translational energy , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number of degrees of freedom of the component , and these contributions cancel in the difference @xcite .",
    "the remaining contribution is due to the difference between the configurational parts of the internal energy @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in the literature",
    "it is common to consider the gas to be ideal , so that it acts as a reference state to an adsorbed phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 .",
    "this defines the partial molar heat of adsorption @xmath59 as    @xmath60    in this study we are interested only in the hydrate phase .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 defined by [ eq / heatofadsorption/03 ] is then a property of a hydrate phase with reference to an ideal gas phase .",
    "this is typical in the simulation community and conforms with the discussion in [ sec / freeenergy ] , to describe the hydrate phase only @xcite .",
    "we shall use [ eq / heatofadsorption/03 ] for hydrates filled with single components , and calculate the molar heat of adsorption of ch@xmath1 and co@xmath0 .",
    "the derivative of the internal energy of the hydrate with respect to the number of adsorbed molecules can be calculated in a number of ways @xcite . in gcmc simulations , one calculates the molar heat of adsorption from the fluctuations of the thermodynamic quantities as @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 denotes an ensemble average in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we perform grand - canonical monte carlo ( @xmath65vt ) simulations of ch@xmath1 and co@xmath0 in a 2x2x2 unit cell of si hydrate , which has 64 cages , with a lattice parameter 12.03  @xcite .",
    "the number of running cycles was varying from 500 to 500000 in order to achieve the desired accuracy .",
    "the system became equilibrated rather quickly , typically after 300 - 500 cycles .",
    "the number of mc moves per cycle is equal to the number of particles of each component in the system , with a minimum of 20 .    in gcmc simulations",
    "one specifies the chemical potential of a component and calculates the average number of particles which correspond to this chemical potential . for this a number of monte carlo moves is performed , typically attempts to displace a particle from one position in the box to another and to exchange particles with the reservoir . in the semi - grand canonical mc simulations , we specify @xmath20 and @xmath66 or @xmath16 , @xmath67 and we find the loading of the guest components @xmath18 and accordingly the helmholtz energy of the gas mixture in the hydrate . in our gcmc simulations the molecules were allowed to change their position and orientation . they were also subjected to regrow , swap , and identity change @xcite mc moves .",
    "furthermore , a series of nvt simulations has been performed to analyze the distribution of molecules between the cages . in this case",
    "the number of adsorbed molecules was specified , while the chemical potential was adjusted during the simulation .",
    "the guest molecules were allowed to change the position and orientation as well as regrow .",
    "the oxygen positions of water molecules were taken from crystallographic data @xcite .",
    "the orientation of hydrogen atoms was chosen random in accordance with the bernal - fowler rule @xcite .",
    "initially all the hydrogen atoms were assigned randomly to each of 4 sites of the water molecule ( 2 sites from the hydrogens and 2 sites for the hydrogen bonds to the neighboring molecule ) .",
    "then a short monte carlo procedure has been performed to displace the hydrogen atoms between the sites randomly , in order to satisfy 2 conditions : i ) each oxygen atom has only 2 hydrogen atoms , and ii ) there is only 1 hydrogen atom between each 2 oxygen atoms . the third requirement , that the number of the hydrogen atoms of the corresponding wyckoff type is given , was satisfied automatically after the above procedure .",
    "the water model is tip5pew @xcite .",
    "we performed simulations with both immobile and mobile water molecules , so in the latter case they were allowed to change their position and orientation . during the simulations we have found",
    "that behavior of the system with mobile and immobile water molecules is similar , while the fluctuations were larger for the case of mobile molecules . in the analysis of the results we therefore present the data for a rigid water framework .",
    "the description of the guest molecules was taken from the trappe force field @xcite .",
    "we performed simulations for the range of the temperature from 278 k to 328 k. the adsorption isotherms were qualitatively the same for all the temperatures in this range .",
    "we therefore focused on the temperature of 278 k.    the adsorbed components were assumed to be in equilibrium with an imaginary gas reservoir . specifying the chemical potentials of the components in this gas",
    "determines therefore the chemical potentials of the components , adsorbed into the hydrate .",
    "this procedure is typical in the molecular simulations of adsorption @xcite .",
    "the chemical potentials of the components can be specified in two ways .",
    "first , the pressure of the gas in the reservoir and its composition can be specified .",
    "the peng - robinson equation of state is used to calculate the chemical potential or the fugacity of each component .",
    "this method was used to obtain single component adsorption isotherms and @xmath68-@xmath69 diagrams for mixtures . the pressure varied in the range between 10@xmath2 pa and 10@xmath3 pa in these simulations .",
    "second , one can specify the fugacities of the components directly using the lewis - randall rule @xcite . according to the lewis - randall rule",
    ", the fugacity of each component equals the product of its mole fraction and the pure component fugacity at the same temperature and pressure of the mixture .",
    "this method was used to obtain the adsorption isotherms for mixtures .",
    "this allowed us to perform the integration of [ eq / freeenergy/06 ] along each chemical potential , keeping the chemical potentials of the other components constant .",
    "the fugacity of each of the components varied in the range between 10@xmath2 pa and 10@xmath3 pa .",
    "the single component adsorption isotherms for co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 at 278 k are shown in [ fig / loading ] .",
    "we see how the hydrate loading , @xmath70 , varies with applied pressure @xmath15 on a si unit cell with 8 cages .",
    "the pressure axis is given in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the error bar is less than the size of the symbol , for a hydrate with immobile water molecules .",
    "the adsorption isotherms of co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 for the case of mobile water molecules are also similar ( not shown ) .    at first sight",
    ", the adsorption isotherms in [ fig / np ] may look like langmuir adsorption isotherms , however the fitting of the one- or two- site profiles to such isotherms is not satisfactory .",
    "still , the co@xmath0 isotherm reveals a two - site adsorption behavior .",
    "this can be explained by the structure of si clathrate .",
    "a unit cell of an si hydrate has 6 large and 2 small cages .",
    "being a relatively large molecule , co@xmath0 tends to occupy large cages first .",
    "small cages start to be filled only after the large cages have been occupied .",
    "this can be also seen on [ fig / cages_co2 ] .",
    "this figure shows the distribution of co@xmath0 molecules between several cages , obtained from a nvt simulation .",
    "the positions of these molecules from 500 snapshots were combined and drawn on a single figure .",
    "when the loading of co@xmath0 is small ( @xmath71 ) , the loading of the large cages is much larger then the population of small cages . at intermediate loading ( @xmath72 ) , which corresponds to the plateau in the co@xmath0 adsorption isotherm ,",
    "some small cages start to be filled , while the other small cages remain almost unoccupied .",
    "finally , at high loading ( @xmath73 ) , all the cages are occupied uniformly .",
    "the cell with 2x2x2 units of si clathrate has 64 cages . having 66 molecules adsorbed into clathrate",
    "means that some cages contain 2 co@xmath0 molecules .",
    "this happen at large pressures only .",
    "double occupancy of a cage can be explained by the linear form of co@xmath0 molecule , which allows special orientation in large cages .",
    "the ch@xmath1 isotherm , on the other hand , reveals a one - site adsorption behavior .",
    "the reason for this is that ch@xmath1 molecules are rather small and have almost no preference between large and small cages .",
    "however , the cage size is not completely irrelevant for the ch@xmath1 distribution : otherwise the adsorption isotherm would be a perfect single - site langmuir curve .",
    "the typical distribution of ch@xmath1 molecules is shown on [ fig / cages_ch4 ] .",
    "the snapshots were obtained in the same way as those on [ fig / cages_co2 ] from @xmath65vt simulations at different gas pressures .",
    "this figure shows that ch@xmath1 fills the cages uniformly showing almost no preference to large or small cages , in contrast to co@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we computed the adsorption isotherms for different temperatures in the range between 273 k and 328 k. the results of simulations are presented on [ fig / t_np ] .",
    "one can see , that increasing the temperature leads to the decrease in the amount of adsorbed molecules both of co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 . nevertheless , the hydrate becomes completely filled at pressures about @xmath5 pa .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the distribution of the co@xmath0 molecules in cages with respect to the temperature .",
    "recall that if the loading is less then 6 , then mostly the large cages are being filled , while the higher loading correspond to filling also small cages .",
    "we see from [ fig / t_np - co2 ] that increasing the temperature makes the isotherm to cross the line @xmath74 at higher pressure .",
    "furthermore , the plateau at @xmath74 becomes less pronounced when the temperature is increased .",
    "this shifts the type of adsorption isotherm from 2-site to 1-site , which means that the difference between cages becomes less , when the temperature is increased .",
    "the ch@xmath1 adsorption isotherm is qualitatively the same at different temperatures .",
    "increasing the temperature only increases the pressure at which the desired loading is achieved .",
    "isotherms for hydrates loaded with mixtures of co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 are shown in [ fig / xpy_co2+ch4 - 01 ] .",
    "this figure shows the co@xmath0 mole fraction in the hydrate as a function of the gas pressure and the corresponding co@xmath0 mole fraction in the gas phase .",
    "one can identify two regions in the figure , with the pressure above approximately @xmath75 pa and below @xmath75 pa . as one can see from [ fig / np ]",
    "this is approximately the pressure where the adsorption isotherm of co@xmath0 reaches the plateau . in both regions the molar",
    "content of co@xmath0 in the hydrate increases gradually when the content of co@xmath0 in the gas phase increases .",
    "when the pressure is below @xmath75 pa the co@xmath0 molecules fill the large cages while the ch@xmath1 molecules fill both the small and the large cages .",
    "thus , there is no preference between large and small cages .",
    "therefore , the mixture composition in the hydrate is approximately the same as in the gas phase over the whole range of compositions , see [ fig / xy ] . at approximately @xmath75",
    "pa the large cages are all filled and only small cages are available .",
    "co@xmath0 molecules can not compete with ch@xmath1 molecules for these cages , since the former ones are larger than the latter ones .",
    "it is mostly ch@xmath1 molecules which occupy the small cages in the mixture , see [ fig / xy ] .",
    "[ fig / xy ] compares the results of the mixture loading with ideal adsorption solution theory ( iast ) @xcite .",
    "the concept of ideal solution for the adsorbed components is analogous to the raoult s law for vapor - liquid equilibrium .",
    "it holds well for mixtures of similar components which are adsorbed on similar sites . for segregated systems ( when one component adsorbs on one type of sites while the other component adsorbs on the other adsorption sites ) it is known that it does not work @xcite .",
    "as one can see from [ fig / xy ] , the mixture can be considered ideal at small pressures , which are below the pressure when co@xmath0 loading reaches the plateau . at these pressures co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 molecules",
    "occupy the large cages equally likely",
    ". even though ch@xmath1 and co@xmath0 molecules are different , the large cages are so large , that they show no preference to the components they would adsorb . at pressures larger than @xmath75",
    "pa we observe preferential adsorption for ch@xmath1 molecules , so the mixture can not be considered ideal . at these pressures",
    "the small cages are being filled , so it is natural that they prefer small ch@xmath1 molecules rater than large co@xmath0 molecules .",
    "it becomes clear that at high pressures iast does not hold .",
    "we next consider the dependence of loading on the fugacity of each of the component , which is shown on [ fig / nff ] .",
    "we see that the loading of each of the component increases proportionally to its fugacity .",
    "furthermore , the increase of the fugacity of one of the components complicates the adsorption of the other component and vice versa .",
    "this explains the dark triangular region in the bottom - right and the top - left corners of the figure for co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 respectively .",
    "furthermore , one can see the gradual filling of the hydrate with the increase of the total fugacity @xmath76 which is related to the gas pressure .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the adsorption isotherms on [ fig / nf_eos ] .",
    "we first report the helmholtz energy for the single component hydrates .",
    "[ fig / fn ] shows this helmholtz energy for co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 hydrates .",
    "one can see , that the more molecules are adsorbed , the lower is the helmholtz energy per mole .",
    "this means that the hydrate is becoming relatively more stable as the number of molecules increases .",
    "this is well known @xcite , because empty cavities are not stable and guest molecules are required to stabilize them .",
    "furthermore , one can see that the helmholtz energy for the co@xmath0 hydrate is lower than that of the ch@xmath1 hydrate over the whole range of loadings .",
    "this indicates that the co@xmath0 hydrate is more stable than the ch@xmath1 hydrate .",
    "furthermore , we consider the temperature dependence of the helmholtz energy of a single component hydrate . the computed data in the range of temperatures between 273 k and 328 k are presented on [ fig / t_fn ] .",
    "one can see , that variation of temperature does not affect the helmholtz energy at all .",
    "this means , that the change of the entropy with respect to the change in loading is zero , @xmath77 .",
    "this indicates that the adsorbed molecules in different cages do not interact .",
    "we next consider the helmholtz energy of the gas mixtures in hydrate . [ fig / fff_co2+ch4 ]",
    "shows how the helmholtz energy depends on the fugacities of each of the components .",
    "we see that there is a certain region where this energy is lowest , so the hydrate with gas mixture would be more stable at these composition . at low fugacities",
    "there are not that many molecules adsorbed , which means that many cages are empty .",
    "this makes the gas hydrate structure unstable , which explains the dark region on the figure in the bottom - left corner . if both fugacities are high , both co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 molecules prefer to occupy the cages .",
    "competition for an available cage makes the hydrate structure less stable , as well .",
    "this is indicated by the dark region on the figure in the top - right corner .",
    "finally , if only one of the two fugacities is large , while the other is low , only the high fugacity molecules tend to fill the cages and the hydrate structure becomes relatively more stable .",
    "these considerations of stability are not conclusive , however . as explained in the introduction a more complete set of thermodynamic data",
    "is needed to evaluate the possibility of hydrate formation .",
    "namely , the values of the helmholtz energy of different phases which can be formed of ch@xmath1 , co@xmath0 and water are required .",
    "we shall return to this point in our next work .",
    "it is still interesting to plot [ fig / fff_co2+ch4 ] in a @xmath15-@xmath69 scale , where @xmath15 is the gas pressure , which is in equilibrium with the guest molecules in the hydrate , and @xmath69 is the mole fraction of co@xmath0 in the gas phase . the distribution of the helmholtz energy of the hydrate with gas mixture for this case is shown in [ fig / fpy_co2+ch4 ] .",
    "the pressure and the mole fraction were calculated from the fugacities of the components using the lewis and randall rule @xcite .",
    "we see that the hydrate is more stable at high pressures ( i.e. at high loadings ) if pure gas is being adsorbed .",
    "in contrast , if we have a mixture , the highest stability is achieved at moderate pressures .",
    "[ fig / fpy_co2+ch4 ] shows that there is a region in the pressure - composition diagram , which connects a relatively stable methane hydrate with a relatively stable carbon dioxide hydrate .",
    "while at low and high pressures the hydrate with gas mixture is unstable , it is almost as stable as either single component hydrate at moderate pressures .",
    "this is very promising , since one of the goals of our research is to find a path on a phase diagram to convert a pure ch@xmath1 hydrate into a pure co@xmath0 hydrate without destroying its structure . in a pursuit of this path",
    "it will therefore be interesting to focus on the lightest region on the diagram .",
    "on [ fig / fpy_co2+ch4_p ] this path is drawn schematically .",
    "note that following this path implies that one does not meet any energy barrier : the value of @xmath10 along it is almost everywhere constant . in contrast , going from pure ch@xmath1 hydrate to pure co@xmath0 hydrate at constant pressure around @xmath78 pa requires crossing an energy barrier of 50 - 100 kj per mol of unit cell .",
    "we see that this path goes through a region where a mixture of ch@xmath1 and co@xmath0 is adsorbed into a hydrate .",
    "namely , one has first to decrease the pressure of pure ch@xmath1 hydrate down to approximately @xmath75 pa . at this pressure",
    "there is enough space in the large cages for co@xmath0 molecules to go into them .",
    "next , one has to increase the content of co@xmath0 in the surrounding fluid .",
    "this would lead to the filling of the large cages with co@xmath0 molecules while the ch@xmath1 molecules will be expelled out of the hydrate .",
    "when there is no ch@xmath1 in the mixture , the small cages are empty at the pressure @xmath75 pa , and this is the time to start filling them in with the co@xmath0 molecules .",
    "this is the last part of our path which ends up with a pure co@xmath0 hydrate .",
    "[ fig / hn ] shows the partial molar heats of adsorption , [ eq / heatofadsorption/06 ] , of the single component hydrates obtained from gcmc simulations . at high loading ( @xmath79 )",
    "the calculated value of the partial molar heat of adsorption starts to fluctuate .",
    "this is expected for gcmc simulations , since in the dense phase which is realized at high loadings , the fraction of accepted trial mc moves is quite low .",
    "this means that that we shall trust the results at small and moderate loadings only ( not more then 6 - 7 adsorbed molecules per unit cell )",
    ". both sets of data agree with the findings above .",
    "we see in [ fig / hn ] that the partial molar heat of adsorption of ch@xmath1 decreases almost linearly with the loading over the whole range of loadings .",
    "we also know that the change of the entropy @xmath80 with respect to the change in loading ( see [ eq / intro/01 ] ) is zero . the single - site adsorption isotherm shown on [ fig / np ] for methane",
    "can thus be explained by [ fig / hn ] alone .",
    "in contrast , for carbon dioxide one can distinguish the two regions for the partial molar heat of adsorption of co@xmath0 . at small loadings the partial molar heat of adsorption decreases , similar to that for ch@xmath1 . at this moment",
    "the large cages of the hydrate are being filled in . at moderate loadings",
    "the partial molar heat of adsorption has a tendency to increase , however .",
    "this corresponds to the filling of the small cages of the hydrate . as the co@xmath0 molecules prefer not to be in the small cages , more and more energy is required to get them into hydrate at high pressures .",
    "knowing that @xmath81 also here , the shape of the curve in [ fig / hn ] can explain the adsorption isotherm for co@xmath0 shown on [ fig / np ] .",
    "indeed , the profiles on [ fig / hn ] at small loadings are not exactly linear , which implies that the adsorption isotherm is not langmuir - like .    the profile for co@xmath0 in [ fig / hn ] changes direction not at @xmath74 which corresponds to the complete filling of the large cages .",
    "the minimum is when only 4 - 5 cages are filled in .",
    "this may be explained by a strong interactions of large asymmetric co@xmath0 molecule with water cages @xcite .",
    "the partial molar heat of adsorption of co@xmath0 is lower than the one of ch@xmath1 over the whole range of loadings which can be trusted .",
    "this supports the preferential filling of the large cages by co@xmath0 molecules .",
    "furthermore , we consider the temperature dependence of the partial molar heat of adsorption of a single component hydrate . the results of simulations in the range of temperatures between 273 k and 328 k are presented on [ fig / t_fn ] . within the error of simulation",
    "one can consider the partial molar heat of adsorption to be temperature independent , like the helmholtz energy , computed in the previous section .",
    "in this paper we studied the thermodynamic properties of an si hydrate filled with co@xmath0 , ch@xmath1 and the mixture of those . by performing grand - canonical monte carlo simulations",
    ", we obtained adsorption isotherms for single components and gas mixtures , partial molar heats of adsorption of single components , and the helmholtz energy of a hydrate with the gas mixture referred to an empty hydrate .",
    "the results show that the state of the hydrate is determined by the relation between the size of the clathrate cages and the guest molecules .",
    "the si hydrate unit cell has two types of cages , 6 large and 2 small ones .",
    "the small methane molecules can easily fill both the large and the small cages , while the larger and not spherically symmetric molecules of carbon dioxide prefer the large cages .",
    "this determines the two regions of the hydrate state with various loading .    at a small pressure",
    "the co@xmath0 molecules tend to fill the large cages only .",
    "every new adsorbed molecule decreases the helmholtz energy of the gas mixture in the hydrate so that the hydrate becomes more stable .",
    "this happens until all the large cages are occupied .",
    "then the small cages start to be filled .",
    "while the hydrate is still becoming more stable ( the helmholtz energy is decreasing ) , the relative increase in stability becomes smaller .",
    "the methane adsorption reveals almost no preference to cage type , so the partial molar heat of adsorption is always decreasing , which means that every new molecule is more welcome than the previous one .",
    "the helmholtz energy is always decreasing , which means that the fully occupied hydrate is the most stable one comparing to a partially filled hydrate .",
    "furthermore , we studied the temperature dependence of the loading , the helmholtz energy and the partial heat of adsorption . while the adsorption isotherm of single - component hydrate shifts when the temperature is changed , the dependence of the helmholtz energy and the partial heat of adsorption on loading is unaltered by the change of the temperature .",
    "this indicates that the adsorption may be considered as ideal , i.e. the interaction between adsorbed molecules in different cages is low .",
    "the single - component adsorption behavior determines the regime of mixture adsorption .",
    "the adsorbed mixture may be regarded as ideal , but only when the large cages are being filled . at this point",
    "there is almost no difference between the behavior of co@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 molecules . in contrast ,",
    "when small cages start to be filled , the hydrate with gas mixture reveals strong preference to ch@xmath1 adsorption .",
    "finally , the diagram obtained for the helmholtz energy of the gas mixture in hydrate is promising .",
    "it may suggest a way to convert ch@xmath1 hydrates , which are excessively available at the sea bottoms , to co@xmath0 hydrates .",
    "this could play a role for the question of co@xmath0 storage , without destroying a hydrate .",
    "if one considers [ fig / fpy_co2+ch4 ] as a starting point , a possible path corresponds to going from the top left corner ( pure ch@xmath1 hydrate , full loading ) to the top right corner ( pure co@xmath0 hydrate , full loading ) . in order to keep hydrate stable , i.e. to not use extra energy to destroy it",
    ", one has to go along the colored path on [ fig / fpy_co2+ch4_p ] .",
    "from the kinetic point of view it may be complicated to perform an exchange of molecules in a hydrate , since , unlike zeolites , a hydrate does not have empty channels for molecules to go in . in practice",
    ", the exchange could be performed in a distorted clathrate structure @xcite .",
    "existence of such a path must presently be seen as qualitative , as we are lacking information on the thermodynamic properties of the the other phases which can be in equilibrium with the hydrate phase , cf .",
    "[ eq / intro/01 ] .",
    "our further efforts are now directed into calculating the phase diagram and the remaining thermodynamic data .",
    "we would like to thank juan - manuel castillo sanches for help with simulations and bjrn kvamme for fruitful discussions .",
    "we are also grateful to the vista grant # 6343 .",
