    "the anisotropy of stellar orbits in elliptical galaxies can be estimated from the temperature of the hot interstellar gas through which they move .",
    "these two quite different galactic attributes are intimately related by the jeans equation for the stars and the condition for hydrostatic equilibrium in the gas .",
    "this simple relationship is valuable since both the anisotropy and gas temperature are difficult to extract from optical and x - ray observations , respectively .",
    "many massive elliptical galaxies are nearly spherical ( merritt & trembly 1996 ) and slowly rotating , but their stellar velocity ellipsoids are not in general isotropic .",
    "the non - spherical nature of the stellar velocity dispersion is represented by the parameter @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial stellar velocity dispersion and @xmath8 is the dispersion in a transverse direction , i.e. @xmath9 . if the orbits are predominantly radial , @xmath10 , the line of sight velocity profile becomes more strongly peaked than a gaussian profile with increasing projected radius @xmath11 ; if the orbits are mostly tangential , @xmath12 , the profile is more flat - topped and becomes broader with increasing radius .",
    "both @xmath0 and the galactic potential @xmath13 can be determined from optical observations of the line of sight velocity dispersion @xmath14 , the optical surface brightness distribution and the deviation of the stellar line profiles from a gaussian as expressed by the line - symmetric coefficient @xmath15 in a gauss - hermite expansion ( e , g , van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "stellar line profiles observed in most massive e galaxies indicate a preference for radial orbits with @xmath16 ( bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 ; gerhard et al . 1998 ; saglia et al . 2000 ) .",
    "accurate @xmath0 profiles from optical data require high quality data and considerable care in reduction and analysis .",
    "the radially anisotropic nature of stellar orbits in luminous elliptical galaxies provides important and otherwise unavailable information about the merger history of these galaxies ( naab , burkert & hernquist 1999 ) , so an improved or independent determination of @xmath0 would be desirable .",
    "similarly , the radial variation of the hot gas temperature @xmath17 k in elliptical galaxies depends on the spatial and spectral resolutions of x - ray detectors and the accuracy of the three - dimensional decomposition that converts @xmath18 as a function of projected radius @xmath11 to physical radius @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , it is often unclear whether the hot gas at any radius has a single temperature or a multitude of temperatures as might be expected if the gas were cooling .",
    "it is unclear if the gas cools at all .",
    "for example , high resolution x - ray spectra with xmm - newton of the large e galaxy ngc 4636 fail to show emission lines expected from gas at intermediate temperatures , such as the 0.574 kev ovii line ( xu et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggesting that the gas is not cooling below @xmath20 as in classical cooling flows .",
    "however , bregman , miller & irwin ( 2001 ) detected the ovi 1032,1038   doublet in ngc 4636 emitted from gas at @xmath21 k , implying that cooling near the expected rate may occur after all .",
    "as an additional source of confusion , the observed x - ray spectra can often be significantly improved by assuming two quite different discrete temperatures at each galactic radius ( e.g. buote 2002 for ngc 1399 ; buote et al .",
    "2002a and tamura et al .",
    "2003 for ngc 5044 ) .",
    "while the origin and physical nature of gas with only two ( or a limited continuum of ) temperature phases may be conceptually problematical , it may be related to certain heating mechanisms .",
    "nevertheless , there are good reasons for suspecting the accuracy or interpretation of gas temperature profiles @xmath1 in elliptical galaxies .    in the following discussion",
    "we illustrate the close relationship between the radial variations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 using data for the well - observed giant elliptical ngc 4472 . while currently available data for this galaxy are adequate to illustrate this relationship , more accurate optical and x - ray data will be necessary to verify @xmath0 or @xmath1 with confidence .",
    "we recognize that ngc 4472 is not perfectly spherical ; its optical image has been variously classified as e1 or e2 , however , optical determinations of @xmath0 for ngc 4472 and other nearly - spherical elliptical galaxies have been made under the assumption of spherical symmetry ( e.g. kronawitter et al .",
    "indeed the very concept of the @xmath22 anisotropy parameter is only valid in spherical geometry .",
    "similarly , the gas temperature @xmath1 determined from x - ray observations of ngc 4472 and other nearly spherical elliptical galaxies are based on the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "one justification for this is that the stellar gravitational potential that confines the stars and hot gas within the half - light radius is always more spherical than the underlying stellar luminosity distribution ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1996 ) .",
    "our discussion of the close relationship between stellar anisotropy and gas temperature is a thinly - veiled request for observers to concentrate on those luminous e galaxies for which the most accurate x - ray and optical data can be acquired .",
    "the jeans equation for the radial stellar velocity dispersion @xmath7 is @xmath23 where @xmath3 is the stellar luminosity density corresponding to the stellar velocity dispersions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium in the hot interstellar gas is @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath26 is the proton mass and @xmath27 is the molecular weight .",
    "the uniformity of the stellar mass to light ratio within the effective radius of ngc 4472 is excellent evidence that the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( brighenti & mathews 1997 ) .",
    "both equations contain the same gravitational term @xmath28 . eliminating this term results in an equation explicitly independent of the confining mass : @xmath29 = { d c^2 \\over d r } + { c^2 \\over r } \\left [ { d \\log \\rho \\over d \\log r } \\right].\\ ] ]",
    "this equation has been discussed previously , particularly in the context of the anisotropic orbits of galaxies in rich clusters that contain hot gas ( e.g. fabricant et al .",
    "in addition to hydrostatic equilibrium , the validity of this equation depends on the assumption that the gas pressure exceeds that of any other interstellar pressure such as turbulence , cosmic rays , etc .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( as well as @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) are known from observations , then equation ( 3 ) can be solved for @xmath32 and the line of sight velocity dispersion is then found from @xmath33   \\ell_*(r ) ( r^2 - r^2)^{-1/2 } r dr   \\over \\int_r^{r_t } \\ell_*(r ) ( r^2 - r^2)^{-1/2 } r dr } \\ ] ] ( e.g. binney & mamon 1982 ) . in this equation @xmath11",
    "is the projected radius and @xmath34 is some radius significantly beyond the limit of the available data ( we assume @xmath35 ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is known , equation ( 3 ) can be solved for @xmath32 for various parameterized temperature profiles @xmath1 until @xmath14 from equation ( 4 ) agrees with observed velocity dispersions . by this",
    "means it is possible to derive the gas temperature profile @xmath1 from a knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , if the gas temperature @xmath1 is securely known from x - ray observations , then @xmath0 can be determined by requiring that solutions @xmath36 of equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) pass through the observations .",
    "this close relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is possible and valuable because @xmath31 , @xmath30 and @xmath36 are much easier to determine from observations than either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .    except for the very central region ,",
    "the stellar brightness in ngc 4472 is well - fit with a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the stellar b - band luminosity density @xmath37 is determined by the total luminosity @xmath38 @xmath39 and the effective radius : @xmath40 kpc , assuming a distance @xmath41 mpc . however , within a small `` break '' radius , @xmath42 pc , the stellar luminosity flattens to @xmath43 ( gebhardt et al . 1996 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ) . in figure 1",
    "we compare the ( un - normalized ) stellar luminosity density @xmath31 in ngc 4472 with the hot gas density profile @xmath30 determined from x - ray observations .",
    "the remarkable proportionally @xmath44 was first discovered by trinchieri , fabbiano & canizares ( 1986 ) .",
    "x - ray observations of the hot gas temperature in the central region of ngc 4472 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "only three observations of the gas temperature are available in the region within 10 kpc where @xmath22 has been determined from optical observations .",
    "the filled circles show rosat deprojected gas temperature observations from buote ( 2000 ) . the linear temperature profile defined by these two temperature observations @xmath45 is shown in figure 2 with a solid line . from chandra data",
    "soldatenkov , vikhlinin & pavlinsky ( 2003 ) have recently provided an additional temperature measurement of @xmath46 at radius 1  = 0.0824 kpc that is shown with a filled square in figure 2 .",
    "the linear fit to the buote data passes within the error bars of the soldatenkov et al .",
    "observation , so all three observations are consistent with a linear temperature profile within the effective radius @xmath47 kpc .",
    "although the x - ray data is sparse in the region of interest , it is in perfect qualitative agreement with linear gas temperature profiles observed in other bright elliptical galaxies in @xmath48 ( fig . 1 of brighenti & mathews 1997 ) .",
    "the open circles in figure 3 show observations of the line of sight stellar velocity dispersion in ngc 4472 ( from bender et al .",
    "1994 ) that were used by kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to determine @xmath0 from optical observations alone .",
    "the filled circles in figure 3 are the data of fried & illingworth ( 1994 ) .",
    "both sets of observations lie entirely within the effective ( half - light ) radius , @xmath49 kpc .",
    "for some reason the normalization is systematically different in the two sets of optical observations .",
    "the fried - illingworth data have smaller error bars , less overall scatter and resemble in overall form the velocity dispersion profiles @xmath14 of other well - observed ellipticals [ e.g. gerhard et al . ( 1998 ) for ngc 6703 ] .",
    "the observational uncertainties apparent in the data sets shown in figure 3 make it difficult to determine with confidence any radial dependence of the stellar anisotropy .",
    "consequently , we assume that the orbital anisotropy @xmath22 in equation ( 3 ) is constant over the range @xmath50 kpc .    in figure 3",
    "we compare solutions of equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) with the observed line of sight stellar velocity dispersion in ngc 4472 .",
    "each solution curve @xmath14 is based on the linear gas temperature profile in figure 2 and a particular value of @xmath22 .",
    "more information about the solutions shown in figure 3 can be found in table 1 .",
    "of the three solid lines designed to fit the fried - illingworth data , solution 2 with initial @xmath51 km s@xmath52 and @xmath53 fits the data best .",
    "solutions 1 and 3 show additional marginally acceptable fits although they fall respectively below and above the fried - illingworth data at smaller projected radii @xmath11 .",
    "evidently @xmath54 is the most likely anisotropy based on the gas temperature observations . in some of our solutions of equation ( 3 ) @xmath55 becomes unphysically negative at a radius @xmath56 less than the outer limit of our integration in equation ( 4 ) , @xmath57 ; for these solutions we replace @xmath34 with @xmath56 . in solutions 4 - 6 , shown with dashed lines in figure 3 , we find that the anisotropy parameter must have values @xmath58 to be in approximate agreement with the data of bender et al .",
    "once @xmath59 is selected for each of these dashed line solutions in figure 3 , the vertical position of the solution is extremely sensitive to @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath22 must be specified to one part in 1000 to pass through the center of the bender et al . data .",
    "one may doubt if nature can be so discriminating",
    ". nevertheless , for either set of optical data , the corresponding values of @xmath22 are about twice as large as the @xmath60 found by kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from the bender et al .",
    "data .      the preferred orbital anisotropy in ngc 4472 determined by kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from the bender et al .",
    "observations can be accurately represented with @xmath61 which peaks at @xmath62 kpc where @xmath63 . in this section",
    "we assume that @xmath64 is correct and solve equation ( 3 ) for @xmath65 and @xmath1 . as before we consider only linear temperature variations defined by two temperatures @xmath66 and @xmath67 evaluated respectively at @xmath68 kpc and @xmath69 kpc . we seek values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for which solutions @xmath14 of equation ( 4 ) pass through or near the bender et al . optical data .",
    "we begin with a set of solutions for which @xmath70 and the temperature profile is constrained to agree with the observed linear @xmath1 in figure 2 .",
    "when @xmath31 and @xmath30 are taken from figure 1 as before , the only remaining undetermined parameter required to solve equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is @xmath59 . the four short dashed lines in figure 4 show the line of sight velocity dispersion profile @xmath14 for @xmath71 km s@xmath52 , corresponding to solutions 7 - 10 in table 1 . since we are using the kronawitter et al .",
    "@xmath64 , it is appropriate to compare these solutions only with the data of bender et al . from which @xmath64 was derived .",
    "of these , the best - fitting solution is 9 , but the overall flat or positive slope [ @xmath72 at larger @xmath11 does not resemble the @xmath14 profiles of most well - observed e galaxies . since none of these solutions is a particularly good fit to the bender et al .",
    "data , it appears that @xmath64 found from optical data alone is somewhat inconsistent with the observed hot gas temperature profile .    to explore alternate x - ray temperature profiles that may agree better with the @xmath14 of bender et al . , we consider solution 11 in which the hot gas is isothermal at the mean value of the two buote temperatures in figure 2 , @xmath73 k. this solution , shown with a dotted line in figure 4 , decreases slightly with @xmath11 , in better agreement with data in @xmath74 kpc",
    ". solutions with negative @xmath75 may fit even better , but all known x - ray observations for e galaxies have positive @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "finally , we consider solution 12 based on a temperature profile having the same slope as the observations in figure 2 , but with uniformly higher temperatures , @xmath77 k and @xmath78 k. in solution 12 ( solid line in figure 4 ) the radially decreasing line of sight dispersion @xmath14 follows the bender et al .",
    "data better than any other curve in figure 4 , possibly suggesting that the gas temperature should be higher than the observations in figure 2 . therefore ,",
    "either the gas temperatures from x - ray observations in figure 2 are too low or @xmath64 and the @xmath14 data from which it was derived are inaccurate .",
    "we have shown that equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) establish a useful correspondence between the anisotropy of stellar orbits in elliptical galaxies @xmath0 and the temperature of the hot interstellar gas @xmath1 . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath79 relation is based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium for the hot gas and requires reliable observations of the stellar and gas densities and the stellar line of sight velocity dispersions .",
    "this connection between @xmath22 and @xmath18 is possible only if the galaxies are nearly spherical , as emphasized by maggorian & ballantyne ( 2002 ) .",
    "if the gas temperature profile @xmath1 in an e galaxy is securely known from x - ray observations , @xmath0 can be determined from the observed stellar velocity dispersion using equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . in principle , this method of determining @xmath0 could be done at galactic radii much larger than @xmath80 where stellar observations of @xmath15 may be difficult but where observations of @xmath14 and x - ray gas temperatures are generally reliable .",
    "conversely , if @xmath0 can be observed with high precision from optical observations , the hot gas temperature @xmath1 can be found from equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) by using the gas density from x - ray observations .",
    "this means of determining @xmath1 may be particularly valuable in regions of the hot gas atmospheres where x - ray spectra indicate a two - temperature or limited multi - temperature thermal structure ( e.g. buote 2002b ) that may complicate the determination of the average local gas temperature .    as a representative example , we have used the @xmath22@xmath18 relation to determine @xmath0 in the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 4472 from the hot gas temperature profile @xmath1 found from x - ray observations .",
    "the resulting anisotropy , @xmath81 , indicates that the stellar orbits are considerably more radially biased than implied by the smaller @xmath82 determined from optical observations alone ( kronawitter et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these large @xmath22 for ngc 4472 are based on the fried - illingworth stellar velocity dispersions @xmath14 .",
    "somewhat lower anisotropies , @xmath58 are consistent with the velocity dispersion observations of bender et al . , but these @xmath22 still exceed the @xmath82 found optically by kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the kronawitter et al . @xmath70 and the bender et al .",
    "( 1994 ) data are correct , then the gas temperature in ngc 4472 may be higher than previously thought from x - ray observations and possibly have a different slope @xmath75 .",
    "these conclusions apply only to the limited region @xmath76 for which @xmath14 data currently exist for ngc 4472 .",
    "it is clear , at least for ngc 4472 , that currently available observations are not sufficiently accurate to establish either @xmath0 or @xmath1 with complete confidence .",
    "accurate optical observations of @xmath14 and stellar line profiles can be observed with 8 - 10 meter telescopes to several @xmath80 and @xmath1 is also often known at these large radii .",
    "in addition , it may be possible to determine gas temperature profiles with more accurate or prolonged x - ray observations than those in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath0 determined from x - ray emission can serve to calibrate the accuracy of purely optical determinations or to provide a test for hydrostatic equilibrium . to accomplish this",
    ", it would be desirable to obtain high quality stellar dispersion and gas temperature observations of those galaxies  such as ngc 4472 , ngc 4649 , ngc 1399 , m87 , etc .",
