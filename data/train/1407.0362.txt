    "a quantum system in equilibrium at a finite temperature is not in a pure state , but rather is described by a thermal density matrix .",
    "however , just like a classical pendulum or a loaded spring which keep performing for some time their periodic motion in a thermal environment , so can an appropriately entangled quantum system keep its coherence for a while .",
    "the thermal environment generates a random fluctuating force operating on the classical harmonic oscillator system .",
    "the `` fluctuation - dissipation theorem '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) then implies that these damp the initial ordered periodic motion leaving only the @xmath5 thermal energy per degree of freedom .",
    "similarly , thermal effects will tend to decohere the quantum system , which started say as a pure state .",
    "@xcite    rather than address the full and involved question of the general quantum version of the fluctuation dissipation theorem , we address here two examples .",
    "these are two effects which to certain degrees are spoiled and weakened by a randomizing and decohering thermal milieu .",
    "while these effects seem superficially to be unrelated , we believe that at a deeper level they are and both pertain to the general issue considered .",
    "the first effect is a  polarized \" version of the casimir force between two neutral parallel conducting plates @xcite .",
    "it arises when the two plates conduct in different directions . beyond its @xmath6 dependence on the separation @xmath7 of the two plates ,",
    "the casimir force per unit of area then depends also on the angle @xmath8 between the directions of conductance @xcite .",
    "this dependence reflects the vector nature of light , namely , the polarization degree of freedom .",
    "the casimir force and its variant can be viewed , like many other forces , as being generated by the the interaction of the plates ( or  big \" objects in general ) with smaller elements or modes of the intervening medium .",
    "the forces can be calculated exactly by using the euclidean path integral method introduced and extensively used in this context in the thesis of o. kenneth @xcite .",
    "the casimir force per unit area at finite temperatures is well known @xcite and can be readily derived by the path integral approach where the time direction is compactified down to a size of @xmath9 . when @xmath10 , the thermal casimir force has a @xmath11 dependence and is stronger than the ordinary ( i.e. , zero temperature ) casimir force @xmath12 as indeed suggested by a simplistic argument .",
    "below , we evaluate the polarized variant of the casimir effect for finite temperature .",
    "this calculation was motivated by the prospect that the effect will be measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "the setup considered was at room temperature of 300 k , i.e. , @xmath13 and plate separation a of few microns .",
    "contrary to  naive expectations \" , the calculation implies that the dependence of the force on @xmath8 , the angle between the conduction directions of the plate falls , off exponentially with temperature like @xmath14 .",
    "this is attributed to the randomizing effect on the polarization of the photons in a thermal background as they travel between the two plates .",
    "the second effect concerns the  aharonov - bohm force \" suggested to occur @xcite between magnetic fluxons immersed in a fluid of electrons due to phases which the electrons pick when circulating the fluxons . in particular , for  semions \" , namely half - fluxons - in units of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the _ electron _ rather than the cooper pair charge of 2@xmath16- which naturally arise inside superconductors , this ` topological ' force was found to be attractive even for fluxons with parallel magnetic fields .",
    "this was inspired on the one hand by analogy with the casimir effect with the electrons ( rather than the vacuum and/or thermal photons ) playing the role of the relevant excitations of the medium and by some remarkable features of the the ground state of electronic system in the presence of half - fluxons @xcite . to achieve it in a real setup of physical superconductors",
    ", we have to use a finite temperature @xmath17 so that we have both supeconductivity and fluxons and a finite fraction of unpaired electrons to generate the force of the form @xmath18 with @xmath19 the separation between the fluxons and @xmath20 the two - dimensional number density of the electrons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was remarked that unless somehow screened by countering currents , the force was rather large .",
    "here we note that decohering effects can randomize the elctrons phases over time intervals of order @xmath21 and naturally lead to an exponentially falling force between two nearby semions .",
    "the reduced symmetry of the present problem relative to the case of the casimir parallel infinite plates , hinders exact evaluation of the thermal path integral though it suggests the same qualitative results .",
    "we next speculate on the feasibility of testing the effect now that we have it in a more realistic and correct form .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : section 2 presents a discussion of the rather long relaxation time of a simple classical harmonic motion in certain cases even in the presence of a thermal background . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we briefly review the two effects / forces mentioned above and present the new and more involved finite temperature discussion . in section 5 we comment on the connection with the general theme of thermal decoherence and",
    "it is instructive to recall how classical systems can maintain  coherent \" motion despite a thermal background @xmath12 as we conjecture that similar persistence effects may be relevant also to the quantum case .",
    "consider then an ` ideal ' sensitive torsion balance designed to measure tiny @xmath12 say , gravitational forces .",
    "it consists of a horizontal bar hung at its center by a thin long and ideally ( ! ! ) a loss - free fiber .",
    "the system is enclosed inside a cylinder pumped to very low pressure of @xmath22 atmospheres .",
    "when gravitationally torqued by a pair of massive near - by spheres , the bar and fiber system starts performing a periodic harmonic twist motion .",
    "the question of interest is the extent to which finite , say even room temperature , effects of the medium impair the function of the torsion balance . for generic @xmath23",
    "kg masses of rod and external spheres , dimensions and distances of @xmath24 cm , and a nano - radian rotation of the bar , the gravitational energy involved and that of the resulting energy in the oscillatory mode are comparable with or smaller than @xmath25 , the generic thermal energy per degree of freedom . however , only after that much energy is pumped to that particular mode of motion of the rod will it s motion be appreciably affected .",
    "after the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium - all degrees of freedom and that of the whole rod considered here as well , will by the equipartition theorem , each have an energy of @xmath26 .",
    "however , if this relaxation is driven only by collisions with the ambient residual gas molecules ( or with thermal photons which only drastic cooling can eliminate ) the times required for damping this motion are very long and hence this effect does not hinder the performance of useful experiments .",
    "in the standard case of isotropic conducting plates of area @xmath27 , the casimir force per unit area is given by @xcite @xmath28 we now consider the case of plates which conduct only along one direction .",
    "the exact evaluation of the casimir energy / force per unit area utilizes the path integral . for clarity , we reproduce some of key steps from an earlier work @xcite . unless explicitly inserted otherwise , we will set both the speed of light @xmath29 and the boltzmann constant @xmath3 to unity ( @xmath30 ) in the calculations that follow . in the presence of conducting plates 1 and 2 , which are both parallel to the x@xmath12y plane and separated by a distance `` @xmath7 '' along the @xmath31 axis",
    "the partition function is given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 are the standard em fields and @xmath34 denotes the currents .",
    "in the last term , the scalar product @xmath35 is performed only along the area - time of the plates . here and",
    "henceforth , @xmath36 and @xmath37 will denote the currents in the first and second conducting plates , respectively .",
    "if both plates conduct only along a single spatial direction , then @xmath36 and @xmath37 will have spatial projection restricted to the @xmath38th plate ( along the specified conductance directions in each of the plates ) . the total current @xmath39 .",
    "as is well appreciated , the currents serve as lagrange multipliers forcing the vanishing of the respective components of the electric fields along the two plates . integrating ( after a wick rotation ) the quadratic form in @xmath40 we find    @xmath41,\\ ] ]    where we used the conservation of @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the resulting gauge freedom to choose the simple configuration space feynman propagator in 4-dimensional space - time , @xmath44 .",
    "it is important to underscore that the currents @xmath45 , the coordinates , and the momenta @xmath46 to appear shortly , all live in the 3-dimensional @xmath47 space .",

    "the latter manifests by replacing the energy , @xmath71 integration above by a sum over the matsubara frequencies @xmath72    @xmath73.\\ ] ]    using @xmath74 , we then have the casimir free energy per unit area at non - zero temperatures , @xmath75.\\ ] ] this last equality and further analysis bellow imply that at high temperatures ( or high matsubara frequency @xmath76 ) , all @xmath77 terms vanish exponentially .",
    "since the only other dimensionful energy parameter in the problem is @xmath78 with a the plate separation , the  high temperature \" dimensionless parameter @xmath79 where @xmath80 which is the ratio of the two energy scales must be large .",
    "the key observation is that if we keep only the lowest n=0 mode we lose @xmath81 dependence on the angle @xmath8 between the conductance directions !    as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hand01right ] ) , a matsubara index @xmath82 , or equivalently , @xmath83 , implies that @xmath84 . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : hand02 ] ) we find that @xmath85 identically and @xmath86    expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath87 , integrating each term , and summing up the resulting series @xmath88 , we obtain the high temperature limit of the casimir free energy : @xmath89 .",
    "the corresponding casimir force is set by @xmath90 ; this result will be further motivated by heuristic arguments to be briefly presented later . at high temperatures ( @xmath91 )",
    "this `` finite temperature casimir force '' is larger than that of the zero - temperature pure case of plates in the vacuum by a factor of order @xmath79 .",
    "our main concern here though is the resulting dramatic suppression of the dependence on the relative angle @xmath8 between the conductance direction in the two plates .",

    "@xmath101 k , we find already for this small separation @xmath7 that largest terms with non - trivial angular dependence , i.e. , the @xmath102 terms , are small .",
    "for @xmath103 micron , @xmath104 .",
    "the largest contribution to the casimir free energy and force originates from the first ( @xmath82 ) term in the matsubara sum which is trivially angle ( @xmath8 ) independent ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence originating from the non - zero matsubara frequencies is reduced by a factor of three for a plate separation of a micron ( and is exponentially decreasing in @xmath7 ) . reserving a more careful evaluation of this effect at various temperatures to future work",
    ", we still wish to have a better physical understanding as to why the rather strong @xmath8 dependence at @xmath0=0 rapidly diminishes as the temperature is increased . to this end , we briefly review heuristic albeit crude arguments that seems to suggest that the @xmath8 dependence is not altogether removed .",
    "forces between macroscopic objects are often the consequence of interaction with smaller particles and/or excitations in the surrounding medium . for our purpose",
    "it is useful to consider then two parallel plates immersed in a thermal molecular gas that are a distance @xmath7 apart .",
    "one might think that the molecules impinging on the plates from the outside there will generate a net pressure pushing them towards each other .",
    "this conflicts with basic expectation that in a system with uniform pressure _ no _ net force can be exerted on any object .",
    "the nice resolution is shown in the left panel of figure ( [ fig : figslide3 ] ) showing that the rare `` spoiler '' molecules that sneak in between the plates keep moving back and forth and reflecting from the plates exactly counter the effect of all the many outside collisions .",
    "if , however , as shown in the right panel of figure ( [ fig : figslide3 ] ) , the gas molecules have a distribution of sizes and in particular have diameters of order a then they will not be able to go inside and a net apparent attraction between the plates will thus be generated .",
    "[ ht ]     it seems natural to extend these simplistic arguments - which indeed have been verified in colloidal systems - to a gas of thermal photons .",
    "indeed photons/@xmath106 modes of wavelengths @xmath107 exceeding the plate separation @xmath7 - can not propagate inside this `` wave guide '' .",
    "such modes can not serve then as  spoilers \" for the inward pressure from the outside collisions .",
    "the number density of such modes of wavelength larger than @xmath108 is of the order of @xmath109 . in the @xmath110 regime",
    ", each mode has an energy of @xmath25 ( and each mode is is populated by @xmath111 quanta ) .",
    "the resulting net pressure and attractive force paper unit area @xmath112 is @xmath113 as predicted by the path integral formulation above .",
    "it is well known that many phenomena in q.e.d derive and/or can be attributed to the existence of the vacuum fluctuations with each mode carrying `` half '' a quantum or zero point energy of @xmath114 . a simple repetition of the above leads to @xmath115 .",
    "however when pushed further to more subtle effects such as the dependence of the force on the angle @xmath116 between the directions of conductivity of the two plates which is the topic of interest here , the naive argument seems to completely fail .    to see this",
    "let us consider the following setup which hopefully can be used to heuristically motivate and in some subtle incarnation also measure the effect . instead of having the parallel casimir plates made of full metal sheets we have two frames strung with sufficiently dense and thin parallel wires .",
    "these then correspond to the casimir plates with the preferred conductance directions namely along the wires in each frame .",
    "the two extreme cases studied above then correspond to the setting of figure ( [ fig : figslide4 ] ) .",
    "right panel : orthogonal plates ( @xmath117).,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    in the first case only photons polarized along the common - say @xmath118 direction - of the wire will be effectively reflected by the induced currents in the thin wires .",
    "we then expect that the casimir force in such an arrangement will be reduced by a factor half as and amusingly this was indeed found both for the @xmath119 and for the @xmath120 cases by the path integral method .",
    "if , however , the wires are crossed at 90 degrees then the polarized photons coming from the outside will sail through the left mesh and then reflect back from the right mesh .",
    "however since an equal amount of y polarized photons reflect from the outside of the right mesh - no net force should arise .",
    "this is flatly negated by the path integral computations .",
    "first it was found @xcite that for the @xmath1210 case , the force in the crossed case , as illustrated on the right panel of figure ( [ fig : figslide4 ] ) , is reduced by only by @xmath122 as compared with the parallel wires case , depicted in the lefthand panel of figure ( [ fig : figslide4]a ) .",
    "this can be ` explained ' by the fact that our argument naively assumed that all photons move along the @xmath31 direction whereas all direction of incidence should be considered .",
    "the key question still remains - why did we go so wrong in the thermal case and what makes here the direction / polarization effect decay so fast- as @xmath123 ?",
    "we believe that the answer is relatively simple though instructive .",
    "the naive argument fails because of the decoherence effects at finite temperature .",
    "clearly the path integral calculation which is far more sophisticated seems superior and is indeed correct .",
    "specifically we expect that practically at all times the photons are not in any specific polarization state but in an equal mixture of both .",
    "the exponential suppression of the effect with temperature could be qualitatively argued for as follows : the average number of photons in any mode @xmath46 of frequency @xmath124 is @xmath125 the probability of having zero thermal photons then is @xmath126 .",
    "since all thermal photons are maximally mixed we have then only the `` 1/2 '' vacuum photon contributing the exponentially suppressed effect .",
    "let us assume that the decoherence time is set just by the temperature and is indeed @xmath127 .",
    "if the distance travelled during this time - the decoherence distance @xmath128 is much larger than the separation of the plates @xmath7 than while in transit the photon could decohere @xmath129 times .",
    "the probability that it will stay in its original polarization state and contribute to the angular ( @xmath130 ) dependent force is then reduced by @xmath131 .",
    "the key observation is that , up to constants of order unity , @xmath132 is the shortest minimal decoherence time which is consistent with the quantum uncertainty relation : @xmath133 when we substitute the thermal energy ( @xmath134 for the energy uncertainty scale @xmath135 . in specific set - ups",
    ", we might have it much longer than that this lower bound scale .",
    "it is worth noting that the formal path integral approach in which the attraction between say two charged particles can be viewed as resulting from the joint propagation in the same background field is not completely different from what we are discussing albeit in a very simplistic view here .",
    "what the naive , almost mechanistic , approach sorely misses are aharonov - bohm ( or even coulomb ) phases of the form @xmath136 .",
    "we next turn to the effects of thermal decoherence on casimir - like forces generated by such aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phases .",
    "the better known evaluations of the casimir energy are by the summing the energy shifts of all the photon modes in the vacuum , induced by the introduction of the plates at their specified location .",
    "it is assumed that the plates or other conducting/ dielectric objects , have large inertia and can be viewed as static .",
    "some time ago it was pointed out @xcite that similar  ab type \" interactions are generated between magnetic fluxes @xmath137 located at given points @xmath138 inside a two dimensional region where the wave function of n electrons is non - vanishing .",
    "the introduction of the fluxes which play here the role of the heavy degrees of freedom modifies the the ground state wave - function :    @xmath139    the energy shift relative to the magnetic field free case , @xmath140 , generated by having magnetic fluxes depends on their sizes and location .",
    "this shift generates via a born oppenheimer type approximation , an interaction between the fluxes    @xmath141    where the gradients of @xmath142 are the forces @xmath143 that act on the fluxes @xmath144 . in the following we recall the estimate of this interaction and resulting forces between the fluxons",
    "so as to be able to discuss the thermal decoherence induced screening of theses forces .",
    "the calculations are greatly simplified if we first neglect the interaction between the electrons so that the ground state is antisymmetrized product state ( filling up a fermi circle in an appropriate parametrization ) .",
    "the total energy then is simply the sum of the shifts of the individual states    @xmath145    a sense of the size of the effect is obtained by considering first just one flux @xmath146 at the center of a circular disc of radius r with a uniform two dimensional electron density @xmath147 .",
    "the fluxon @xmath148 is the flux quantum appropriate to the charge e of a single electron . by rotational symmetry ,",
    "the initial electron wave functions are eigenstates of the angular momentum @xmath149 with integer eigenvalues @xmath150 . for the purpose of finding the effect of the fluxes , the exact @xmath151 form for the wave - functions ,",
    "can be wkb approximated by semiclassical paths of fixed radii .",
    "the introduction of the fluxon increases all of the @xmath152 values by @xmath153 ,    @xmath154    and correspondingly modifies the relevant angular parts of the energies @xmath155 .",
    "the sum of the energy shifts for a single @xmath156 pair is then shifted by @xmath157 .",
    "summing over all l and r values so as to account for all the @xmath158 electron states we find that the total energy shift is : @xmath159 where @xmath160 , the distance betweeen the electrons serves as a lower cutoff .    the logarithmic dependence of @xmath161 on the size of the system reflects an underlying scaling invariance of the effective two - dimensional potential generated by the fluxes .",
    "it suggests that the interaction between two fluxons @xmath162 and @xmath163 at a distance @xmath164 and far from the boundaries is :    @xmath165    with @xmath166 some function of the individual fluxes and a logarithmic dependence on the relative distance .    unlike the casimir force",
    ", the present force is of a toplogical nature .",
    "the energy @xmath167 due to a fluxon @xmath153 is proportional to @xmath69 only for @xmath168 .",
    "integer @xmath153 amount to pure gauge as a shift of all angular momenta by an integer amounts to a negligible `` surface '' effect modifying the energy of states with angular momenta near @xmath169 only .",
    "this and the time reflection symmetry corresponding to @xmath170 imply that @xmath167 is maximal for @xmath171 and falls off as @xmath172 in the @xmath173 $ ] interval and periodically repeats beyond that . for this reason the pair - wise force is maximal between fluxes of size @xmath174 .",
    "furthermore , the force is attractive even when the latter are parallel to each other since as the fluxons move closer together more electrons see just the effective total and trivial integer flux and pick no phase upon encircling the pair : @xmath175    the topological nature also manifests in that no force is experienced by a fluxon located outside the region where the electrons are confined since the phases picked up by the electrons when traveling along any closed loop -which drive all these effects,- do _ not _ depend on the location of out - side fluxon .",
    "half fluxons that are parallel to each other are particularly relevant as they may naturally occur in superconductors .",
    "unfortunately this makes calculations for assessing the observability of this new type of force much harder than for the case of the formally somewhat similar casimir effect .",
    "the casimir plates are well defined macroscopic objects whereas the fluxons are generated via a collective effect of the cooper pairs and electrons in the superconductor , i.e. , the basic element comprising the medium which generates the new force between the fluxons .",
    "it was conjectured @xcite that the large mutual interaction energies of the fluxons might induce some counter - currents of electrons which weaken the other - wise very strong force .    here",
    "we focus on the more concrete thermal decohering which can reduce the force .",
    "it too is connected with the specific material effects . in the case of",
    "the casimir plates one could reduce the ambient temperature to very low values so that ( when all constants are restored ) the dimensionless product @xmath176 is small enough and also the path integral formal calculation will allow a measurable angle dependent casimir forces .",
    "this however can not be done here even in principle .",
    "the temperature @xmath0 of the superconductor where we propose to study possible attraction between fluxons _ must _ be a finite fraction @xmath177 of the critical temperature for the onset of superconductivity , @xmath178",
    ". only then will a finite fraction @xmath179 of all the electrons remain unpaired into cooper pairs , and only these unpaired electrons generate the force between the half - fluxons .",
    "thus we have to address the question of the thermal decoherence effects on the new force between the fluxons . in order to disentangle this from other matter",
    "linked effects we use the idealization where the fluxons can be viewed as external rigid entities immersed into the electrons .",
    "we could then compute the ",
    "casimir like force \" per unit length due to the electrons in the medium by using a path integral and then include the thermal effects by compactifying the euclidean time direction to the distance 1/t .",
    "two technical difficulties may hinder such a calculation .",
    "first , even for non - interacting electrons , the path integral has the sign problem arising from the fermi statistics and the non - vanishing chemical potential .",
    "also the symmetry of the problem is reduced from the 3d translational invariance ( in the @xmath180 and @xmath181 directions ) when we have the parallel infinite casimir plates geometry to one with only a spatial invariance with @xmath31 the direction of the fluxons .",
    "@xcite    we will not attempt such a calculation here .",
    "we believe , however , that at @xmath119 , it will reveal the logarithmic interaction energy of @xcite . also as in the path integral calculation of the casimir force , at finite t , this long range interaction will be screened and fall exponentially with a characteristic decoherence length @xmath182 .",
    "it derives from the decoherence time @xmath183 for @xmath184 via @xmath185 as the latter fermi velocity is the velocity of the electrons . for the force to be readily measurable",
    "we need that the average distance l between the parallel fluxes in an abrikosov lattice be smaller than @xmath186 . but l must be greater than the radius d of the individual fluxons which , in turn , is of the order of the london penetration length @xmath187 .",
    "the condition then becomes @xmath188 whereas the opposite inequality characterizes the type ii superconductors in which abrikosov flux lattices exist .",
    "indeed the very existence of such lattices requires that the ordinary magnetic repulsive force between the parallel fluxons will dominate .",
    "in the current work , we discussed two quantum systems ( involving the casimir and ab type effects ) examined their stability to thermal decoherence .",
    "in the first case , an explicit path integral calculation for the finite temperature system , suggested substantial decoherence for the polarized casimir force rendering experimental attempts for measuring the relative conductance angle dependence force unlikely to succeed .",
    "we have not been able to perform an explicit @xmath119 and @xmath189 path integral evaluation of the second system with ab force between fluxons in a superconductor reflecting the phases ( sign flip ) picked up by unpaired electrons circulating the fluxons in superconductors .",
    "however similar arguments to those used in the casimir case suggest that the situation may be notably different .    the conventional coherence length for electrons @xmath190 is smaller in generic type ii superconductor than the london penetration length which in turn is smaller than the diameter of a single fluxon let alone the distance between two fluxons . at temperatures",
    "@xmath191 , the formal minimal de - coherence length which translates into an exponential screening of the original long range force at @xmath192 will then dramatically reduce the new force and make its detection rather difficult .",
    "there are many other obstacles of a more technical nature for observing this truly unique and interesting force such as the existence of impurities and the possible pinning of the fluxons on those .",
    "still it is not inconcievable that a dedicated high precision measurements of abrikosov lattices for disparate superconductors and temperatures in which both the fraction of unpaired electrons and the ( de)coherence length and of the magnetic field b ( changing the density of fluxons ) may reveal the existence of the force . while differing greatly in many details both of the above examples illustrate albeit the very different , effects of decoherence introduced by finite temperature and both serve as concrete actual examples of the much more formal yet general discussions of the effects of strongly and weakly coupled thermal baths on quantum systems .",
