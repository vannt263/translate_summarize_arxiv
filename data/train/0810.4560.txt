    "disorder may significantly affect the properties of physical systems . spatial localization of one - particle states ( anderson localization ) , for example , is due to uncorrelated random disorder  @xcite ; whereas short range  @xcite and long range correlated @xcite disorder have been associated with the appearance of delocalized states .",
    "interestingly , however , a recent experiment  @xcite shows that long - range correlated disorder may in fact either suppress or enhance localization .",
    "this scenario becomes yet more complex when two or more particles are considered and the effects of interactions are taken into account .",
    "a clear picture of the interplay between interaction and disorder is essential to advance our understanding of thermodynamic and kinetic properties , as well as the dynamical behavior of real quantum many - body systems .",
    "the interest in how interactions influence localization and transport properties of mesoscopic systems was boosted with the realization that persistent currents could only be explained if the role of the electron - electron interaction was addressed @xcite . in general , interaction between particles in disordered systems may lead to delocalization @xcite .",
    "the competition between interaction and disorder in many - body systems relates also to other interesting phenomena , such as the rich variety of quantum phase transitions of ultracold atomic bose gases in optical lattices @xcite , the transition from integrability to chaos @xcite in spin systems , and the enhancement of entanglement @xcite and the ` melting ' of quantum computers @xcite in the context of quantum information .    in the present work",
    "we investigate how disorder combined with interactions affect spatial localization and quantum correlations of a one - dimensional quantum system .",
    "in addition to uncorrelated disorder , we analyze also long - range correlated disorder",
    ". correlated disorder may appear in real systems  @xcite and may also be engineered .",
    "the latter includes the introduction of scatterers  @xcite or speckles  @xcite in a one - dimensional waveguide or yet the individual tuning of on - site energies via local fields  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the extensively studied hubbard model , where interaction occurs between particles in the same site , we consider interaction between particles in neighboring sites .",
    "both dilute and half - filled chains are analyzed .",
    "we study the level of delocalization , determined by the number of principal components npc , and the amount of multi - partite entanglement , quantified by a global entanglement measure @xmath0 , of all eigenvectors of the system .",
    "our numerical results show that : ( i ) in a non - interacting system , npc and @xmath0 decrease with uncorrelated on - site disorder and increase with correlated on - site disorder ; ( ii ) in a clean system , interaction restricts delocalized states to narrow energy bands and the average spatial delocalization decays , while the behavior of quantum correlations is non - monotonic ; ( iii ) in a disordered system the behavior of npc and @xmath0 with interaction depends highly on the number of particles , being non - trivial in a half - filled chain , where quantum chaos may develop ; ( iv ) on average , states of two - interacting particles appear to be delocalized in the considered finite systems with uncorrelated disorder , while one - particle states localize .",

    "when @xmath98 , the energies of the basis vectors form narrow bands of resonant states ( a@xmath109 ) , the energies being determined by the number of pairs of neighboring excitations and by the number of excitations placed at the edges of the chain ( border effects ) .",
    "these energies range from @xmath111 to @xmath112 and the bands are separated by @xmath28 . as the hopping term is turned on , only basis vectors belonging to the same symmetry sector can couple to form the wavefunctions .",
    "in addition , if @xmath113 , the effects of @xmath13 on states belonging to different bands are negligible and the bands , although now of finite width , remain separated . in this case , only states placed in the same band and showing the same symmetries can mix , so the level of delocalization is reduced to the number of states in the band .",
    "moreover , the number of states in a band decreases with the size of the clusters , that is , the number of neighboring excitations  @xcite .",
    "the overall effect in clean systems is therefore the monotonic decrease of average npc with interaction .",
    "the right panel ( a@xmath110 ) shows the values of npc . for this integrable system ,",
    "no clear relationship between npc and e is seen , as expected due to the absence of level repulsion .",
    "it is interesting to contrast this behavior with the 2d clean system , which is chaotic and outlines the shape typical of chaotic tbre  @xcite already at @xmath98 ( data not shown ) . by slightly increasing @xmath97 , the bands broaden .",
    "if @xmath113 , they remain uncoupled ( b@xmath109 ) : the number of resonant intra - band states then decreases and so does npc ( b@xmath110 ) .",
    "this explains the valley that precedes the peak in the npc curves shown in the main panel .",
    "larger disorder is then needed to overlap the bands ( c@xmath109 ) and increase delocalization ( c@xmath110 ) .",
    "notice that the average npc for @xmath98 and 0.3 is approximately the same , although the npc dependence on energy is significantly different ( cf . a@xmath110 and c@xmath110 ) .",

    "the case of @xmath108 is at the borderline , where band overlapping is significant and where level spacing distributions close to a wigner - dyson distribution may still be obtained . for larger interactions , such as @xmath114 ,",
    "the bands are very separated at @xmath98 and do not merge together by increasing @xmath97 , instead , larger disorder simply prevents resonances leading to the monotonic decay of npc ( see main panel ) .    .",

    "for @xmath115 , contrary to npc , the largest value of @xmath0 is found for a clean system in the presence of weak interaction , @xmath116 .",
    "this suggests that interactions are key ingredients for the generation of non - local correlations in a half - filled chain .",
    "therefore , we identify two main factors contributing for multipartite entanglement : the hopping term , which spreads the wavefunction [ a state with on - site localization obviously shows no global entanglement ] , and the interaction term , which further enhances the correlations between the particles .",

    "we studied how delocalization and global entanglement in a quantum many - body one - dimensional system are affected by the interplay between on - site ( uncorrelated and long - range correlated ) random disorder and nearest - neighbor interaction .",

    "when both @xmath47 and @xmath97 are present , the behavior of npc becomes non - trivial .",
    "a clean chain with interacting particles constitutes an integrable model with eigenvectors delocalized in the site - basis .",
    "as uncorrelated disorder is added , symmetries are broken . in the case of weak interaction , @xmath172 , this leads to the onset of chaos and the further increase of npc in the site - basis .",

    "key contributing factors for global entanglement are then interactions and symmetries .",
    "we have also briefly commented on the results for npc in bases other than the site - basis .",
    "the latter is considered in studies of spatial localization , which was our main goal in this work .",
    "however , it is also useful to separate regular motion from chaoticity by analyzing delocalization in a basis where the model is integrable . in the basis consisting of eigenstates of a clean system with interaction ( ip - basis ) ,",
    "a non - monotonic behavior of npc with @xmath47 was also verified for disordered systems with @xmath173 .",
    "this non - trivial behavior of npc with interaction in both the ip- and the site - basis appears to be a main indication of the complexity enhancement of wavefunctions in the chaotic region .",
    "the presence of correlated disorder ( @xmath174 ) has different consequences depending on the value of @xmath47 . by correlating on - site energies , the level of order increases .",
    "a disordered system with non - interacting particles then gets closer to the limit of a clean chain and npc increases . in the presence of interaction ,",
    "the effect is opposite , since here it is disorder that enhances delocalization by breaking symmetries and overlapping energy bands .",
    "the behaviors of npc and @xmath0 with @xmath32 reflect the non - trivial behavior of these quantities with @xmath97 when @xmath39 .",
    "the study of a dilute system allows for the consideration of larger chains . in the presence of uncorrelated disorder ,",
    "contrary to the one - particle case , on average , our results show no sign of anderson localization in the finite systems considered .",
    "long - range correlation delocalize both one and two - particle states .    in a future work ,",
    "we intend to search for conclusive evidences for the absence ( or not ) of localization of two - interacting - particle states in systems with uncorrelated disorder .",
    "we also aim to study in details the effects of symmetries on non - local correlations .",
    "another question worth investigation is how the integrable and chaotic regimes of the considered one - dimensional systems relate to different transport behaviors , namely diffusive or ballistic  @xcite , and to the problem of thermalization  @xcite .",
    "also interesting would be the comparison of results with the hubbard model and the inclusion of long - range interactions to the systems considered .",
