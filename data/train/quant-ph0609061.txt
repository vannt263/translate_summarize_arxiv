    "information storage by nmr , was suggested almost 50 years ago by anderson et.al @xcite .",

    ". the absolute intensity difference spectrum of these two experiments is obtained , followed by the integration of the peak intensities of the 5 bits corresponding to each of the letters .",
    "the pattern of the integrated intensities yields the zero intensity , only at those places where the required letter is present .",
    "the xor search not only searches the required letter , but also searches the letter having the complementary code . for example , as shown in @xcite , the letters `` o = 01111 '' and it s complementary `` p=10000 '' can be searched simultaneously .    in this work ,",
    "the spatial encoding is conjugated with hadamard spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we synthesize 256 phase encoded multi - frequency @xmath76 pulses , each of which consists of 256 harmonics and excite the 256 slices of the water sample , under z - gradient ( fig.[pulse sequence for spatial encoding ] ) .",
    "the phase encoding of the harmonics , in each of the pulses , is given by the rows of the 256 dimensional hadamard matrix , where + and - in the matrix , corresponds to the phases y and -y respectively .",
    "thus the application of the pulse under the gradient ( fig.[pulse sequence for spatial encoding ] ) , creates either @xmath77 or -@xmath77 magnetization of each slice .",
    "the 256 pulses are used to record the hadamard encoded data of 256 slices , by using the pulse sequence of fig.[pulse sequence for spatial encoding ] . as seen in the previous sections , the hadamard encoded data can be suitably decoded to obtain any element ( frequency ) of the hadamard matrix .",
    "it should be noted that , in this case the hadamard encoding is performed on the @xmath77 magnetization of various slices , whereas in the 2d gates ( fig.[pulse sequence]b , section ( ii ) ) , the encoding is done on the z magnetization of the observer qubit transitions .",
    "the hadamard encoded data of 256 slices , stored in 256 separate files , can be suitably decoded to write any binary information , which requires a maximum of 256 bits .    the hadamard encoded data is suitably decoded , to write the sentence , `` the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog '' ( fig.[fox]a , b ) .",
    "the xor search @xcite is performed to search a letter `` u '' , the ancilla pattern for the letter `` u '' is decoded in fig.([fox]c ) , and the difference spectrum of figs.[fox]a and [ fox]c , is shown in fig([fox]d ) .",
    "integration of absolute intensities of the peaks of each of the letters in fig.([fox]d ) , are shown in fig.([fox]e ) .",
    "the zero intensity in fig.([fox]e ) , indicates the presence of letter `` u '' .",
    "maximum intensity is observed for the letter `` j '' , which has a code complementary to letter `` u '' .",
    "the advantage of method is seen in the next example , in which the same data is used to write another sentence and search code for another letter . only the decoding pattern is different in example of figs.[pnmr]a , contains another sentence , `` principles of nuclear magnetic resonance '' , which consists of 200 bits of information .",
    "the letter `` e '' is searched by using the xor search .",
    "the encoded data can also be used for 256 bits of nmr photography @xcite .",
    "the spatial encoding @xcite has the advantage that the relaxation of all the slices ( bits ) is uniform .",
    "it may be pointed out that in the liquid crystal method @xcite as well as j - coupled systems @xcite all the lines are not independent and perturbation of one line can cause disturbance in other lines of the spectrum , which forms the basis of the z - cosy experiment @xcite . on the other hand , in spatial encoding method",
    "the pattern is inhomogeneous broadened and parts of the spectrum can be independently perturbed @xcite .",
    "in this paper we demonstrate the use of hadamard encoding for ( i ) two - dimensional quantum information processing and ( ii ) for parallel search using spatial encoding . for ( i ) , this method converts the 2d experiment to a small number of 1d experiments requiring the fourier transformation , only in the direct dimension .",

    "maps the magnetization of various slices , to the frequency space .",
    "each slice is treated as a classical bit which can exists either in 0 or 1 , which in the frequency space respectively correspond to no excitation and excitation .",
