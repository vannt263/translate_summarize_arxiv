    "strange meson and baryon photoproductions provide a very useful tool in studying the properties of strange hadrons and , in particular , in examining the structure of non - strange baryon resonances that can not be seen in the non - strange @xmath6 channel .",
    "this was shown manifestly in the investigation of kaon photoproduction off the nucleon targets , i.e. , @xmath7 , which has been studied intensively both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "these works show that nucleon resonances play a crucial role in understanding the production mechanisms of the reaction in the resonance region  @xcite .",
    "the recent upgrade plans of the photon - beam facilities such as the leps2 project at spring-8  @xcite and the clas12 project at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf )  @xcite will enable us to study the photoproduction processes of heavier strange - mesons with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "this will enrich our understanding of strange hadrons .",
    "in particular , the production of strange vector mesons can be investigated in detail .",
    "the experimental studies on the exclusive production of the @xmath2 vector mesons from photon - nucleon scattering have been reported only recently  @xcite in the data reported in refs .",
    "@xcite was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and was corrected later .",

    "@xcite . ] .",
    "these experiments have measured mostly the total and the differential cross sections and have shown that although the cross sections of @xmath2 photoproduction are small compared to those of kaon photoproduction , their values are non - negligible .",
    "it indicates that production reactions with heavier strange hadrons should be considered when analyzing higher nucleon resonances , which are still less known theoretically as well as experimentally ( see , for example , the particle data group ( pdg ) compilation for the @xmath8 resonances  @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that the upgrades of the experimental facilities can offer a chance to study various physical quantities of @xmath2 photoproduction in detail so that one can have enough data for unraveling the excited spectra of the non - strange baryon resonances .",
    "theoretically , @xmath2 photoproduction was studied in a quark model  @xcite and in the effective lagrangian approach  @xcite . in particular , refs .",
    "@xcite have emphasized the role of the @xmath9-channel scalar @xmath3 meson exchange and have suggested its experimental test .",
    "recently , new experimental data were announced by the clas collaboration at tjnaf  @xcite for the angular distribution of the cross sections for the reaction of @xmath10 . when compared with previous theoretical calculations  @xcite ,",
    "the new data show that the prediction of the model of refs .",
    "@xcite underestimates the cross sections near the threshold , which is in the @xmath8 resonance region .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to reconsider the theoretical model of refs .",
    "@xcite with higher nucleon resonances being taken into account .    in the present paper , we investigate @xmath11 photoproduction off the nucleon targets , i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath12 . employing the effective lagrangian method in the tree - level born approximation , we improve the model of refs .",
    "@xcite by including the contributions of nucleon resonances .",
    "because of isospin conservation , intermediate @xmath13 resonances are not allowed and nucleon resonances can only contribute to this process .",
    "therefore , it is of great significance to extract carefully parameters of the @xmath8 resonances such as their coupling strengths to the @xmath2 and the @xmath14 .",
    "more reliable resonance parameters might be obtained by full partial - wave analyses . however , since the threshold energy of @xmath11 production is about 2  gev , it is reasonable to start with only the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 as relevant nucleon resonances for this process near the threshold , other resonances being neglected .",
    "we will show that these two resonances are enough to address the important role of nucleon resonances in this reaction . following the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , we also take into account other production mechanisms that include the nucleon @xmath17 and hyperon @xmath18 pole contributions in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 channels , respectively , and the exchanges of strange mesons @xmath21 in the @xmath9 channel . a contact - term contribution is considered as well in order to fulfill the current conservation of the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the framework of our model .",
    "the effective lagrangians for the resonance interactions are given explicitly as well as those for the background production mechanisms .",
    "all the parameters used in the present calculation are given explicitly .",
    "we compare our results of the cross sections with the experimental data for the reaction of @xmath22 in sect .",
    "the predictions on the photon beam asymmetries are then discussed .",
    "we also discuss the dependence of these physical quantities on isospin .",
    "section  iv summarizes and draws conclusions .",
    "in the present work , we employ the effective lagrangian method at the tree - level born approximation .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for the reaction mechanisms of @xmath23 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which include the nucleon and nucleon resonance poles in the @xmath19-channel , the @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 meson exchanges in the @xmath9-channel , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 hyperon terms in the @xmath20-channel .",
    "the contact term is also taken into account to preserve the gauge invariance .",

    "<S> we investigate @xmath0 photoproduction off the proton and neutron targets in the effective lagrangian method in the tree - level born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 exchanges which are the main contributions to the reaction , we consider the contributions from the higher nucleon resonances @xmath4 and the @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath4 plays a crucial role in explaining the enhancement of the near - threshold production rate , which results in a good agreement with the experimental data for the proton targets , while the contribution of the @xmath5 is rather small . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion is drawn for @xmath2 photoproduction off the neutron targets . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the energy and angular dependence of the cross sections , we present the predictions on the photon - beam asymmetry . </S>"
