    "topological quantum computation@xcite is immune to certain types of noise .",
    "it has attracted much attention since it was proposed and becomes active again in recent years due to the progress in experiments .",
    "the gates used for quantum computation can be conducted by creating quasi - particles , braiding them and measuring their states .",
    "two well - known types of quasi - particles are fibonacci anyons and ising anyons ( majorana bound states ) .",
    "the former are capable of offering universal topological quantum computation , while the latter can not form an universal set of gates by braiding operation only .",
    "so the non - topologically protected gates have to be introduced in the computation .",
    "this type of gate always requires coupling between majorana bound states ( cmbs ) .",
    "although there is great progress in theories @xcite and experiments @xcite , the question how to couple two mbss is barely explored .",
    "recently , schmidt and his co - workers @xcite presented proposals to couple mbss by putting the system into a microwave cavity , where the microwave field can effectively drive population transfer between mbss .",
    "the authors found that if the microwave frequency approaches the band gap of the topologically trivial region , the coupling between the mbss is exponentially enhanced .",
    "in other words , by modulating microwave frequency or changing number of photons in the cavity , the cmbs can be controlled .",
    "inspiring by this idea , in this work , we study how the central chain affects cmbs .",
    "we realize the universal majorana qubit rotation ( umqr ) by controlling the tunable local gate voltage ( tlgv ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we first briefly review the kitaev model and calculate cmbs in presence of pairing coupling of the central chain itself . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we explore the performance of cmbs when there exist pairing couplings at the boundaries . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we extend our calculations to the central chain with long - range interactions . in sec .",
    "[ v ] we develop a scheme to control cmbs by modulating the amplitude or the frequency of the driving field .",
    "[ vi ] is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "we here consider an inhomogeneous kitaev chain @xcite which can be divided into three homogeneous parts .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the whole chain reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) denotes the hamiltonian of left ( right ) chain with sites from @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath7 represents the hamiltonian of central chain with sites from 0 to @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) denotes the hamiltonian of the coupling between the left ( right ) chain and the central chain . to be specific",
    "the hamiltonian of the three homogeneous kitaev chains can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spinless fermion creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath14 with chemical potential @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 label the beginning and end sites of the left , central , and right chain , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the hopping and pairing amplitudes , respectively . since the phase of the pairing amplitude can be removed from the hamiltonian by a gauge transformation , we here and hereafter assume both @xmath19 and @xmath21 to be real .    physically , the kitaev model can be exactly mapped into a spin-@xmath22 chain with xy interactions by jordan - wigner transformation @xcite and can be realized in the semiconductor nanowire proximity coupling to a @xmath23-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "this paradigm model shows plentiful fascinating topological properties and there are two distinct phases , i.e. , the topologically trivial and nontrivial phases .",
    "the critical points lie at @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .    by choosing @xmath26 ( the chemical potential can be modulated by tlgv @xmath27 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] ) and @xmath28 for the left and right chains , both chains are in the topologically nontrivial phase . as a result there exist mbss at the ends of both chains , depicted by the stars in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] .",
    "one can define majorana operators @xmath29 after substituting them into eq.([2a ] ) , the hamiltonian of left ( right ) chain becomes @xmath30 clearly , the majorana operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 are coupled with different sites .",
    "in particular the majorana operators @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 do not appear in eq.([4a ] ) , which indicate there are four mbss in our system .",
    "since the four mbss are decoupled to the remaining sites and only locate at the end of both left and right chains , we can ignore the hamiltonian of the remaining sites when we study cmbs .    , and the cmbs can be modulated by the voltage @xmath37 . ]",
    "note that to couple mbss one should choose the parameters @xmath38 to make sure the central chain is in the topologically trivial phase . otherwise the mbss @xmath39 and @xmath40 would disappear in this inhomogeneous chain . as we just consider the nearest - neighbour interactions in eq.([2a ] ) , only the mbss @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be coupled to the central chain .",
    "so the hamiltonian of interest is given by @xcite @xmath41 in order to obtain the energy spectrum of the central chain , it is convenient to carry out fourier transform @xmath42 by imposing periodic boundary condition ( we have set the lattice spacing to be unit and fourier transform will be precise when the number of sites is very larege , @xmath43 ) .",
    "the validity of fourier transform is also verified by the numerical calculations in fig .",

    "eq.([12 ] ) demonstrates that the effective cmbs can be induced by the central chain .",
    "physically , @xmath65 represents an amplitude for the mbss to tunnel across the central chain .",
    "this is a virtual co - tunneling process since there exists energy gap in the central chain and real electrons and holes can not tunnel from one mbs to another .",
    "in addition the coupling strength @xmath65 depends exponentially on the length @xmath8 , which is the reason why the mbss are topologically protected . in fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] , we plot the coupling strength @xmath65 versus the chemical potential @xmath66 and the pairing amplitude @xmath67 of the central chain",
    ". one can find that the analytical solutions are in agreement with the numerical solutions when the chemical potential is much larger than the hopping amplitude .",
    "it is also readily observed that the coupling strength @xmath65 decreases with the increasing of chemical potential @xmath66 and is enhanced by the pairing amplitude @xmath67 of the central chain , reminiscent of the results where the majorana qubit setup is placed in a microwave cavity @xcite .",
    "physically , it originates from the fact that the chemical potential associates with the energy gap , and the pairing amplitude is related to the feature of the energy spectrum ( cf .",
    "@xmath68 in eq.([4 ] ) ) . as we know , a larger chemical potential @xmath66 gives rise to a larger energy gap .",
    "the larger energy gap would prohibit the electron co - tunneling , leading to a weak cmbs .",
    "on the other hand , a larger pairing amplitude @xmath67 gives rise to wider of energy spectrum , making more quasi - particles participate in the cotunneling process .",

    "it is interesting to find that the pairing coupling is equivalent to adjust the effective hopping coupling between the central chain and the left ( right ) chain with an effective hopping @xmath78 .",
    "[ fig:04 ] demonstrates the coupling strength @xmath65 as a function of pairing amplitude in the central chain .",
