    "superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) allows studying the interaction between superconducting qubits ( or superconducting artificial atoms ) and quantized microwave fields ( see , e.g. , the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling strengths have been explored from the strong - coupling regime to the ultrastrong one  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the equally - spaced energy structure of the quantized microwave field can be changed to an anharmonic one , including dressed states  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear energy splitting in circuit qed has been experimentally shown by the rabi frequencies for different numbers of microwave quanta inside the cavity  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the experimental spectrum with the square root of the photon - number nonlinearity was reported  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear response of the vacuum rabi resonance was demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "current experimental data indicate that the nonlinearity of the microwave photons can be many orders of magnitude larger than that of macroscopic media . these experiments  @xcite lay a solid foundation for developing microwave nonlinear interactions , which might be used to improve qubit readout  @xcite , and open the door to further study microwave nonlinear quantum optics at the level of single artificial atoms and single microwave photons .",
    "for example , the photon blockade phenomenon  @xcite , where subsequent photons are prevented from resonantly entering a cavity , has recently been observed in circuit qed systems with resonant  @xcite and dispersive  @xcite qubit - cavity - field interactions .     and",
    "the vacuum noise @xmath0 , is applied to the cavity at the left port .",
    "the output field is measured at the right port.,width=8 ]    photon blockade originates from the anharmonic energy - level structure of the light field when the strong photon - photon interaction is induced by the nonlinear medium  @xcite . in circuit qed systems in resonance ,",
    "the anharmonicity of the microwave field is from a highly hybridization of the qubit and the microwave cavity field  @xcite .",
    "however , for the nonresonant case , the qubit can induce the photon - photon interaction when the qubit degrees of freedom are adiabatically eliminated  @xcite .",
    "this photon blockade is the analogue of coulomb blockade  @xcite , where single - electron transport , through a small metallic or semiconductor island sandwiched by two tunnel junctions in electron devices , occurs one by one due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , similar to the single - electron devices using the coulomb blockade , the photon blockade could be used as a single - photon source or single - photon transistor .",
    "one of the basic conditions for photon blockade is that the decay rate of the cavity field should be less than the photon - photon interacting strength .",
    "however , the decay of the photon - number states is very different from those of coherent states  @xcite ; thus , photon blockade might not be observed when the photon number inside the cavity is extremely large .",
    "in addition , bistability is one of the basic properties of nonlinear systems , but there is a lack of studies on the effect of bistability on the photon blockade . here",
    "we will study the relation between bistability and photon blockade and explore the possibility of unblocking the photon of the detecting field by using electromagnetically - induced transparency  @xcite .    in our paper , we will first describe the model hamiltonian in sec .",
