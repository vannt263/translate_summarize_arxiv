    "given two time series can one tell if they originated from interacting or non - interacting systems ? we show that with the help of embedding methods@xcite , takens theorem@xcite and some facts concerning renyi dimensions which we prove",
    ", one can succeed in case of chaotic systems .",
    "moreover , one can quantify the common part of the dynamics , which we call dynamics of interaction .",
    "it happens sometimes , especially in simple systems like electronic circuits or coupled mechanical oscillators , that one knows whether the systems under investigation are coupled or not , what is the direction and sometimes strength of the coupling",
    ". however , there are many complex phenomena in nature where one is unable to verify directly the existence of coupling between parts of the system in which the phenomenon takes place .    especially in complex spatiotemporal systems , like fluid systems , brain , neuronal tissue , social systems etc .",
    "one often faces the problem of characterization of interdependence of parts of the system of interest and quantifying the strength of interactions between the parts .",
    "recent research in neurology , for example , has shown that temporal coordination between different , often distant neural assemblies plays a critical role in the neurophysiological underpinnings of such cognitive phenomena as the integration of features in object representation ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a review ) and the conscious experience of stimuli @xcite .",
    "the critical empirical question , therefore , is which of the neural assemblies synchronize their activity .",
    "since coordination may take many forms , including complex non - linear relations , simple correlational methods may not be sufficient to detect it .",
    "the detection of nonlinear forms of coordination is also critically important for issues in cognitive science @xcite , developmental psychology @xcite , and social psychology @xcite .",
    "the method traditionally used for this purpose is correlation analysis . given two time series one studies their autocorrelation functions and cross - correlations .",
    "large cross - correlations are usually attributed to large interdependence between the parts .",
    "small cross - correlations are considered as the signature of independence of the variables .",
    "unfortunately , the linear time series analysis gives meaningful results only in case of linear systems or stochastic time series .",
    "it is well - known that spectral analysis alone can not discriminate between low - dimensional non - linear deterministic systems and stochastic systems@xcite , even though the properties of the two kinds of systems are different .    methods based on entropy measures represent one viable approach for detecting nonlinear relations between the activity of different neural assemblies @xcite .",
    "recently another approach based on nonlinear mutual prediction has been proposed and used in an experiment .",
    "pecora , caroll and heagy@xcite developed a statistics to study the topological nature of functional relationship between coupled systems .",
    "schiff et al.@xcite used it as a  basis of their method .",
    "the idea is as follows : if there exists a functional relationship between two systems , it is possible to predict state of one system from the known states of the other .",
    "this happens if the coupling between two systems is strong enough so that generalized synchronization occurs@xcite .",
    "the average normalized mutual prediction error is used to quantify the strength and directionality of the coupling@xcite .",
    "the method we introduce in the present paper does not assume generalized synchrony .",
    "we introduce the notion of the _ dimension of interaction _ , which measures the size of the dynamics responsible for the coupling between the two systems .",
    "more precisely , it is the dimension of the part of the attractor of the whole system , which is acted on by the dynamics of both subsystems .",
    "we also show how to obtain information concerning the strength and directionality of the coupling .",
    "the idea is , in fact , very simple . given two time series from subsystems of interest we construct another one which probes the whole system , for instance adding the two series . if the subsystems do not interact , dimension of the whole system is the sum of the dimensions of the two subsystems , all of which can be estimated from data . on the other hand ,",
    "if the subsystems have some common degrees of freedom , dimension of the whole system will be smaller than the sum of the dimensions of the two subsystems .",
    "our method can also be used to find out if two response systems have a common driver .",
    "we discuss this application in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we recall the definition of the renyi dimensions and formulate three theorems which form the basis of our method .",
    "the , rather straightforward , proofs have been relegated to appendix  a , since they are not crucial for understanding the method itself and can be omitted by readers whose main interest is in applications .",
    "we formulate our method in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "classification of all the possible interaction schemes is given in section  [ sec : class ] .",
    "a simple way of verifying the kind and direction of the coupling is provided .",
    "results from the simulations of coupled logistic and hnon maps are collected in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "final comments and outlook are given in the last section .",
    "our method presented in section  [ sec : method ] is based on three theorems relating dimensions of subsystems to the dimension of the whole system .",
    "the first one states the intuitively obvious fact that the dimension of a system consisting of two non - interacting parts is the sum of the dimensions of the subsystems .",
    "a less trivial theorems 2 and 3 establish interdependencies among the dimensions of the system and its interacting parts .",
    "before we state our theorems we shall recall the definition of the renyi dimensions .",
    "it is at present generally accepted that a lot of objects , both in the real physical space and in the phase space , are multifractals @xcite .",
    "this means they can be described by ( statistically ) self - similar probability measures .",
    "this usually implies that they can be decomposed into a ( infinite ) number of objects of different haussdorff dimensions , or , equivalently , they have non - trivial multifractal spectra of dimensions .    the renyi dimensions@xcite have drawn attention of physicists and mathematicians after publication of the papers by grassberger , hentschel and procaccia @xcite . for a probability measure @xmath0 on a @xmath1-dimensional space @xmath2",
