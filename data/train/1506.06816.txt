    "the frequency range of the next generation gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors , such as advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite and kagra @xcite interferometers , is designed to uncover the final inspiral and merger of compact object binaries ( ns - ns , ns - bh , bh - bh systems ) . due to the faint nature of gw signals , an associated electromagnetic ( em ) emission signal coinciding with a gw signal in both trigger time and",
    "direction could play a crucial role for confirming the astrophysical origin of the gw signals and studying the astrophysical origin of the gw sources ( e.g. host galaxy , distance , etc ) .",
    "short - duration @xmath0-ray bursts ( sgrbs ) have long been proposed to originate from mergers of compact object binaries @xcite .",
    "if so , sgrbs may provide the brightest em counterpart associated with events detected by those upcoming interferometers .",
    "however , observations of sgrbs suggest that at least some of them are collimated into a small opening angle @xcite , so that most gw signals would not be detected together with sgrbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "lately , additional em signatures of the compact binary mergers ( especially for ns - ns system ) becomes a topic of growing interest ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that a mildly isotropic , sub - relativistic outflow could be ejected during the merger of binary neutron stars , including the tidal tail matter during the merger and the matter from the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the typical mass and speed of the ejecta are in the range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently , several interesting em signatures from the ejecta have been well studied , whose brightness are essentially determined by the properties of the left over remnant from the merger .",
    "usually , the merger product is assumed to be either a black hole or a temporal hyper - massive neutron star which survives 10 - 100 ms before collapsing into the black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", an optical / infrared transient is expected to be powered by radioactive decay from r - process radioactive material @xcite , henceforth we call it a r - process - powered merger - nova times of the nova luminosity . ] . besides this thermal emission , a long - lasting radio emission is also expected from the interaction between the ejecta and the ambient medium , although it is normally too weak to be detected @xcite .",
    "such transients are more isotropic than sgrbs .",
    "depending on the direction of our line of sight , these transients could be detected alone or to be accompanied by sgrbs , provided that their luminosities are large enough @xcite .",
    "after several years of search @xcite , an r - process - powerd merger - nova was finally claimed to be detected in the infrared band with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) for grb 130603b @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite re - examined the late afterglow data of grb 060614 observed with hst , and found a significant f814w - band excess at @xmath3 days after the burst .",
    "they claimed that it is very likely another candidate of r - process - powered merger - nova .",
    "for both cases , the mergernova interpretation was based on one single data point .",
    "alternatively , it has long been proposed that the postmerger product could be a stable or super - massive millisecond magneter , if the equation of state of nuclear matter is stiff enough and the total mass of the two neutron stars is small enough @xcite .",
    "evidence of a magnetar following some sgrbs has been collected in the swift data , including the extended emission @xcite , x - ray flares @xcite and more importantly ,  internal plateaus \" with rapid decay at the end of the plateaus @xcite . nonetheless , available observations ( e.g. , the lower limit of the maximum mass of galactic nss and the total mass distribution of galactic ns - ns binaries ) and numerical simulations allow the existence of the post - merger massive ns remnant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "compared with the black hole merger remnants , the main consequences of magnetar merger remnants include the following :    * the spin - down of the ns remnant supplies an additional energy source to the system ; * the strong neutrino - driven wind from the ns provides additional mass outflow to the system .    in this case , the detectable em signatures from the system become much richer .",
    "besides the putative short grb signature , the following em signals may be expected .",
    "first , the magnetar would eject a near - isotropic poynting - flux - dominated outflow , the dissipation of which could power a bright early x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "second , the thermal emission from the ejecta could be significantly enhanced due to additional heating from magnetar wind @xcite .",
    "this power could exceed the r - process power , so that we may call the corresponding transient as a `` magnetar - powered merger - nova '' .",
    "finally , the magnetar - power would energize and accelerate the ejecta to a mildly or even moderately relativistic speed , and the interaction between the ejecta and the ambient medium could produce a strong external shock that gives rise to bright broad - band emission ( i.e. the double neutron star ( dns ) merger afterglow model , @xcite ) .",
    "some recently discovered transients could be interpreted within such a scenario , lending support to a post - merger magnetar remnant .",
    "for instance , the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) team recently reported the discovery of a rapidly fading optical transient source , ptf11agg . lacking a high - energy counterpart ,",
    "it has been proposed to be a good candidate for the dns merger afterglow emission @xcite . moreover , considering its broad - band data , grb 130603b and its claimed `` kilonova '' can be interpreted within the framwork of a magnetar - powered dns merger remnant given that the magnetar underwent significant energy lost through gw radiation @xcite .",
    "similar to grb 130603b , grb 080503 is a sgrb with bright extended emission .",
    "based on its negligible spectral lag of prompt emission and extremely faint afterglow , grb 080503 has been classified as a compact - star - merger - origin grb @xcite .",
    "the most peculiar feature in grb 080503 is that after the prompt emission ( began with a short spike and followed by extended emission ) and the early steep decay afterglow phase , it did nt immediately enter into the regular afterglow phase .",
    "being signal - less for about one day , it presented a surprising re - brightening in both the optical and x - ray bands . in the optical",
    ", it remained bright for nearly five days . within the post - merger remnant",
    "is a black hole , the scenario has been investigated for grb 080503 . a ",
    "r - process - powered merger - nova \" model can marginally explain the optical data , but the x - ray data could not be interpreted @xcite . in this work , we make a comprehensive analysis on the multi - band observations of grb 080503 , and suggest that the magnetar merger remnant scenario can well interpret the entire data set , making a solid case to connect the late optical excess of grb 080503 with a magnetar - powered merger - nova .",
    "we note that the idea that grb 080503 is a good candidate for a magnetar - powered transient has been qualitatively proposed by @xcite .",
    "grb080503 was detected by burst alert telescope ( bat ) on abroad _ swift _ satellite at 12:26:13 on 2008 may 3 ( see observational details in @xcite ) .",
    "its prompt emission ( in the 15 - 150 kev bandpass ) contains a short bright initial spike with a duration of 0.32 @xmath4 0.07 s , followed by a soft extended emission lasting for 232 s. the peak flux of the initial spike ( measured in a 484  ms time window ) and the fluence of the extended emission ( measured from 5  s to 140  s after the bat trigger ) are @xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 and @xmath8 erg cm @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "although the fluence ratio between the extended emission and the spike is as large as 30 in @xmath10 , @xcite further analyzed its features of hardness ratio and spectral lag in detail , and found that this burst is still more reminiscent of a compact - star - merger - origin grb .",
    "after the extended emission phase , the x - ray light curve decays rapidly ( @xmath114 , where @xmath12 ) until below the xrt detection threshold , and kept undetectable for about 1 day ( as shown in figure [ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "then the x - ray flux rebrightened to the level of @xmath13 around @xmath14 after the bat trigger .",
    "20 days later , the chandra x - ray observatory acis - s was again employed to conduct imaging on the relevant position , but no source was detected .    in the optical band ,",
    "many facilities were employed to search for afterglow signals on the first night after the trigger , such as swift uv - optical telescope ( uvot ) , keck - i telescope and gemini - north telescope , only a single gemini g band detection was obtained at 0.05 day .",
    "however , on the second night after the trigger , the afterglow surprisingly rise above the detection threshold to the level of @xmath15 and kept bright for nearly five days .",
    "later on , the localization region was observed with hubble space telescope in two epochs on 2008 may 12 and july 29 .",
    "although only upper limits were achieved , the results infer a rapid decay feature for the late optical excess component .    during the observation ,",
    "many attempts to measure the redshift of grb 080503 were operated , even with hubble space telescope .",
    "unfortunately , only an upper limit , @xmath16 , was achieved .",
    "if the equation of state of nuclear matter is stiff enough , the central product for a binary neutron star merger could be a stable or a supra - massive ns rather than a black hole .",
    "this newborn massive ns would be rotating with a rotation period in the order of milliseconds ( close to the centrifugal break - up limit ) , and may also contain a strong magnetic field @xmath17 similar to  magnetars \" .",
    "the millisecond magnetar is surround by a sub - relativistic ( @xmath18 ) ejecta with mass @xmath19 @xcite . considering a variety of the origins for the ejecta materials ,",
    "a spherical symmetry could be reasonably assumed for the ejecta @xcite .    shortly after the formation , the magnetar would be surrounded by a centrifugally supported accretion disc @xcite , launching a short - lived ( @xmath20 ) collimated jet @xcite .",
    "the jet could easily punch through the ejecta shell and then power the prompt short spike emission and the broad band grb afterglow emission @xcite . after the whole jet passing through , it is possible that the gap remains open as the poynting - flux - dominated magnetar wind continuously penetrates through the hole . due to the dynamical motion of the ejecta ,",
    "the ejecta materials tend to quench the outflow by closing the gap . during the early spindown phase",
    "when the poynting - flux luminosity is essentially a constant , the ram pressure of the ejecta may be balanced by the magnetic pressure of the outflow .",
    "after the characteristic spindown time scale @xmath21 , the magnetic pressure drops quickly , so that the gap is closed in a time scale of @xmath22 .",
    "the total duration when the magnetar wind leaks from the ejecta and make bright x - ray emission due to internal dissipation ( e.g. through an internal - collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ( icmart ) process , @xcite ) is the duration of the extended emission , i.e. @xmath23 . according to a more detailed estimate ( see appendix for details ) , this duration can be consistent with the observed duration of extended emission given reasonable parameters .",
    "after @xmath24 , the magnetar wind is stifled behind the ejecta , so that soft extended emission stops and the high - latitute emission in x - ray band shows up , which gives a rapidly dropping x - ray tail @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the situation when the central engine is shut down .",
    "trapped by the ejecta materials , the magnetar continuously spin down , and when the magnetar wind encounters the ejecta , a significant fraction of the wind energy ( parameterized as @xmath25 ) could be deposited into the ejecta , either via direct energy injection by a poynting flux @xcite , or due to heating from the bottom by the photons generated in a dissipating magnetar wind via forced reconnection ( if @xmath26 ) or self - dissipation ( if @xmath27 ) @xcite . such continuous energy injection not only heats the ejecta material to power the merger - nova , @xcite , but also accelerates the ejecta to a mildly or moderately relativistic speed , giving rise to strong afterglow emission by driving a strong forward shock into the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "note that the remaining fraction of the wind energy ( @xmath28 ) would be stored in the trapped dissipation photons and eventually diffuse out with a deducing factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the optical depth of the ejecta .    in summary , there are four emission sites and several emission components involved in this model ( as shown in figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) : i ) the jet component that powers the short spike in prompt emission and the grb afterglow emission ; ii ) the early magnetar wind component that powers the soft extended emission and the high latitude tail emission ; iii ) the magnetar - powered merger - nova emission acomponent , and the corresponding dns merger afterglow emission ; iv ) the late magnetar - wind - powered x - ray component when the ejecta becomes transparent . in the following ,",
    "we describe the details for calculating these main emission components .      considering a millisecond magnetar with an initial spin period @xmath31 and a dipolar magnetic field of strength @xmath32",
    ", its total rotational energy reads @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 for a massive neutron star ) .",
    "the spin - down luminosity of the magnetar as a function of time could be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the initial spin - down luminosity , and @xmath37 is the spin - down timescale .",
    "hereafter the convention @xmath38 is adopted in cgs units .",
    "the spin - down luminosity is essentially carried by a nearly isotropic poynting - flux - dominated outflow . in the free zone",
    "( e.g. in the direction of the cavity drilled by the jet , or the intrinsically open regions in the ejecta ) , the magnetar wind would leak out from the ejecta , and undergo strong self - dissipation beyond @xmath39 , giving rise to extended emission ( along the jet direction ) or a bright x - ray afterglow emission ( off - axis direction , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the confined wind zone",
    ", the magnetar wind is expanding into the ejecta , and the magnetic energy may be rapidly discharged via forced reconnection ( if @xmath26 ) or self - dissipation ( if @xmath27 ) .",

    "this powers the late x - ray excess ; * for this particular event , the dns merger afterglow emission is completely suppressed , since the ejecta mass is relatively large so that the ejecta is only mildly relativistic , and since the medium density is small .",
    "this emission component is not plotted in fig.[fig : fit ] .    in the interpretation",
    ", we adopt the isotropic kinetic energy of the jet as @xmath106 , which is based on the total emission energy of the short spike and assume a factor of @xmath107 for the @xmath0-ray emission efficiency .",
    "the values for initial lorentz factor ( @xmath108 ) and half opening angle ( @xmath76 ) of the jet are chosen as 200 and 0.1 , the values of which barely affect the final fitting results . to achieve the faintness of the grb afterglow emission , a relatively low value for ambient medium density ( @xmath109 ) is required , suggesting that grb 080503 may have a large offset relative to the center of its host galaxy , which in turn explains the extremely deep limit on its host at the afterglow location ( since the system may have been kicked out far away from a host galaxy ) .",
    "the microphysics shock parameters ( e.g. , @xmath90 , @xmath88 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) are all chosen as their commonly used values in grb afterglow modeling ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",

    "if , on the other hand , the wind contains a significant fraction of primary @xmath148 pairs , the magnetic wind may become leptonic - matter - dominated upon interaction with the ejecta , so that a strong reverse shock can be developed , which would predict additional radiation signatures @xcite .",
