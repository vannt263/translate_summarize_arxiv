    "there has been considerable recent interest in graphene sparked by its discovery and subsequent experimental study . in brief , for a carbon monolayer having one mobile electron per atom , a simple tight - binding model shows that the spectrum of low - energy excitations exhibits a linear dispersion relation centred on zeroes located at the six corners of the first brillouin zone ( see e.g. @xcite ) . using a linear transformation among the fields at two independent zeroes it is possible to recast the hamiltonian in dirac form with @xmath3 flavors of four - component spinor @xmath4 , the counting of the massless degrees of freedom coming from 2 carbon atoms per unit cell @xmath5 2 zeroes per zone @xmath5 2 physical spin components per electron .",
    "electron propagation in the graphene layer is thus relativistic , albeit at a speed @xmath6 .",
    "although this is a factor of @xmath7 slower than the speed of light in vacuum , it is still much faster than the speed of electrons in an ordinary conductor .",
    "the implications for the high mobility of the resulting charge carriers ( which may be negatively - charged `` particles '' or positively - charged `` holes '' depending on doping ) is the source of the current excitement .",
    "the stability of the zero - energy points is topological in origin , as emphasised by creutz  @xcite .",
    "while the above considerations apply quite generally , a realistic model of graphene must incorporate interactions between charge carriers .",
    "one such model , due to son @xcite , has @xmath0 massless fermion flavors propagating in the plane , but interacting via an instantaneous 3@xmath8 coulomb interaction . in euclidean metric and static gauge @xmath9",
    "the action reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electron charge , @xmath12 , and the @xmath13 dirac matrices satisfy @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in our notation @xmath16",
    "is a vector in the 2@xmath8 plane while the index @xmath17 runs over all three spatial directions . in the large-@xmath0",
    "limit the dominant quantum correction @xmath18 comes from a vacuum polarisation fermion- antifermion loop and the resummed @xmath19 propagator becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 corresponds to the classical propagation of v. in either the strong coupling or large-@xmath0 limits @xmath23 is thus dominated by @xmath18 , the relative importance of the original coulomb interaction being governed by a parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking , due to the spontaneous condensation of particle - hole pairs , is signalled by an order parameter @xmath25 .",
    "physically the most important outcome is the generation of a gap in the fermion spectrum , implying the model is an insulator .",
    "son @xcite postulates that this insulating phase exists in the corner of the phase diagram corresponding to large @xmath26 and small @xmath0 , and in particular that the insulator - conductor phase transition taking place at @xmath27 in the strong - coupling limit @xmath28 is a novel quantum critical point .",
    "the value of @xmath29 , and the issue of whether it is greater or less than the physical value @xmath3 , must be settled by a non - perturbative calculation . a recent estimate obtained by a renormalisation group treatment of radiatively - induced four - fermion contact interactions ,",
    "is @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the proposed physics is very reminiscent of the three dimensional thirring model , which is analytically tractable at large @xmath0 , but exhibits spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking at small @xmath0 and strong coupling @xcite .",
    "arguably the thirring model is the simplest field theory of fermions requiring a computational solution : the location of the phase transition at @xmath27 in the strong coupling limit has recently been determined by lattice simulations to be @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the apparent similarity of the two systems has led us to propose a thirring - like model pertinent to graphene , with lagrangian @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{eq : model2}\\ ] ] as for ( [ eq : model ] ) we assume a large-@xmath0 limit to estimate the dominant vacuum polarisation correction ; the resultant propagator for @xmath19 is @xmath33 in the strong - coupling or large-@xmath0 limits , @xmath34 coincides with @xmath35 , implying that the fermion interactions are equivalent .",
    "it is also the case that @xmath36 .",
    "this last limit is important because critical behaviour in the thirring model is governed by a uv - stable fixed point of the renormalisation group  @xcite .",
    "we thus expect predictions made with the model ( [ eq : model2 ] ) , and in particular critical behaviour such as the value of @xmath29 , to be generally valid for son s model ( [ eq : model ] ) in the limit of large @xmath37 .",
    "the lattice model studied in this paper is related to the lattice thirring model studied in @xcite , except that in this case we used the compact formulation for the auxiliary boson field .",
    "the simulations were performed with the standard hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm .",
    "@xmath38 vs. @xmath39 near @xmath40 for @xmath3 . ]",
    "the novelty of @xcite is that it is the first study of the thirring model by lattice simulations in the strong - coupling limit @xmath41 .",
    "since we aim to repeat the strategy here we should discuss how this was done .",
    "first , note that the vacuum polarisation calculation leading to the results ( [ eq : d_gr],[eq : d_th ] ) does not go through in quite the same way for the lattice regularised model ; rather , there is an additive correction which is momentum independent and uv - divergent : @xmath42 where @xmath43 comes from incomplete cancellation of a lattice tadpole diagram @xcite .",
    "this extra divergence not present in the continuum treatments can be absorbed by a wavefunction renormalisation of @xmath19 and a coupling constant renormalisation @xmath44 in the large-@xmath0 limit we thus expect to find the strong coupling limit of the lattice model at @xmath45 implying @xmath46",
    ". for @xmath47 @xmath48 becomes negative , and @xmath49 no longer describes a unitary theory .",
    "away from the large-@xmath0 limit , where chiral symmetry may be spontaneously broken , there is no analytical criterion for identifying @xmath50 ; however in this case a numerical calculation of @xmath51 shows a clear peak at @xmath52 , whose location is approximately independent of both volume and @xmath53 , indicating an origin at the uv scale @xcite .",
    "[ gr : beta_peak_nf2 ] exemplifies this behaviour in the lattice model with @xmath3 on system volumes @xmath54 : for @xmath55 we identify @xmath56 .",
    "since for orthodox chiral symmetry breaking the magnitude of the condensate is expected to increase monotonically with the coupling strength , we interpret the peak as the point where unitarity violation sets in , ie .",
    "we use simulations performed at @xmath58 to explore the strong coupling limit , and find clear evidence for a chiral symmetry restoring phase transition at a well - defined @xmath29 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gr : beta_peak ] @xmath59 decreases as @xmath0 increases from @xmath60 to @xmath61 . near @xmath62 the curve reaches a minimum , implying a significant change in the strong coupling behavior of the model .",
    "the rapid change in the value of the condensate at @xmath63 implies a signifacant change in the strong coupling behavior of the model .",
    "this can be a phase transition that separates a chirally broken from a chirally symmetric phase .",

    "equation of state fits to data generated with different fermion masses on different lattice sizes . ]",
    "since our model has anisotropic interactions in the spatial and temporal directions the correlation lengths near the transition diverge with different exponents , @xmath64 in the spatial directions , and @xmath65 in the temporal direction . in this case",
    "a modified hyperscaling relation holds : @xmath66 we carefully monitored the finite size effects in the spatial directions by comparing the values of the condensate at @xmath67 , @xmath68 extracted from simulations on @xmath69 and @xmath70 lattices .",
    "our results show that finite @xmath71 effects are negligible for @xmath72 .",
    "we fitted the data generated on several lattices with @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 to the following rg - inspired equation of state @xcite : @xmath76\\langle\\bar\\psi\\psi\\rangle^p + b\\langle\\bar\\psi\\psi\\rangle^\\delta,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 .",
    "the results show clearly that the model undergoes a second order quantum phase transition and the values of the most significant parameters are : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . the data and the fitted curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ gr : eos ] .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is close to the value of @xmath63 , where a rapid change in the @xmath59 vs @xmath0 occurs .",
    "we presented results from a non - perturbative monte carlo study of a thirring - like model pertinent to graphene .",
    "our analysis of its equation of state at strong coupling reveals that the model undergoes a second order quantum phase transition at @xmath82 , which is greater than the physical @xmath3 value .",
    "this result implies that freely suspended graphene may be an insulator for couplings @xmath1 larger than a critical coupling @xmath83 .",
