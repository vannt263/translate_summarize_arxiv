    "spin systems with quenched randomness have been extensively studied , leading to valuable insights that apply to ( for example ) spin glass materials , quantum hall systems , associative memory , error - correcting codes , and combinatorial optimization problems @xcite .",
    "gauge systems with quenched randomness , which have received comparatively little attention , will be studied in this paper .",
    "the gauge models we consider are intrinsically interesting because they provide another class of simple systems with disorder - driven phase transitions .",
    "but our investigation of these models has a more specific motivation connected to the theory of quantum error correction .    in practice ,",
    "coherent quantum states rapidly decohere due to uncontrollable interactions with the environment . but in principle , if the quantum information is cleverly encoded @xcite , it can be stabilized and preserved using fault - tolerant recovery protocols @xcite .",
    "kitaev @xcite proposed a particularly promising class of quantum error - correcting codes ( _ surface codes _ ) in which the quantum processing required for error recovery involves only _ local _ interactions among qubits arranged in a two - dimensional block , and the protected information is associated with global topological properties of the quantum state of the block",
    ". if the error rate is small , then the topological properties of the code block are well protected , and error recovery succeeds with a probability that rapidly approaches one in the limit of a large code block .",
    "but if the error rate is above a critical value , the _ accuracy threshold _ , then quantum error correction is ineffective .    in @xcite",
    ", a precise connection was established between the accuracy threshold achievable with surface codes and the confinement - higgs transition in a three - dimensional @xmath1 lattice gauge model with quenched randomness .",
    "the model has two parameters : the temperature @xmath3 and the concentration @xmath2 of `` wrong - sign '' plaquettes . on wrong - sign plaquettes (",
    "which are analogous to antiferromagnetic bonds in a spin system ) it is energetically favorable for the @xmath1 magnetic flux to be nontrivial . in the mapping between quantum error recovery and the gauge model ,",
    "the quenched fluctuations correspond to the actual errors introduced by the environment ; these impose sites of frustration , _ magnetic monopoles _ , corresponding to an `` error syndrome '' that can be measured by executing a suitable quantum circuit . thermally fluctuating magnetic flux tubes , which terminate at magnetic monopoles , correspond to the ensemble of possible error patterns that could generate a particular error syndrome .",
    "( the temperature @xmath3 is tied to the strength @xmath2 of the quenched fluctuations through a _ nishimori relation _ @xcite . ) when the disorder is weak and the temperature low ( corresponding to a small error rate ) , the system is in a magnetically ordered higgs phase . in the surface code , magnetic order means that all likely error patterns that might have produced the observed error syndrome are topologically equivalent , so that the topologically encoded information resists damage .",
    "but at a critical value @xmath4 of the disorder strength ( and a temperature determined by nishimori s relation ) , magnetic flux tubes condense and the system enters the magnetically disordered confinement phase . in the surface code , magnetic disorder means that the error syndrome can not point to likely error patterns belonging to a unique topological class ; therefore topologically encoded information is vulnerable to damage .    although the code block is two dimensional , the gauge model is three dimensional because one dimension represents _",
    "time_. time enters the analysis of recovery because measurements of the error syndrome might themselves be faulty ; therefore measurements must be repeated on many successive time slices if they are to provide reliable information about the errors that have afflicted the code block .",
    "if qubit phase errors , qubit bit - flip errors , and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at rates below @xmath4 , then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly from damage in the limit of a large code block .",
    "as we consider more and more reliable measurements of the syndrome , the corresponding three - dimensional gauge model becomes more and more anisotropic , reducing in the limit of perfect measurements to the two - dimensional random - bond ising model .",
    "the numerical value @xmath4 of the accuracy threshold is of considerable interest , since it characterizes how reliably quantum hardware must perform in order for a quantum memory to be robust . in the three - dimensional @xmath1 gauge model , @xmath4 is the value of the wrong - sign plaquette concentration where the confinement - higgs boundary crosses the nishimori line in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane .",
    "a lower bound on @xmath4 is provided by the critical concentration @xmath5 on the @xmath6 axis . in @xcite , an analytic argument established that @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we report on a numerical calculation that finds @xmath7 .    in the case where the error syndrome can be measured flawlessly ,",
    "the critical error rate is given by the critical antiferromagnetic bond concentration on the nishimori line of the two - dimensional random - bond ising model ( rbim ) .",

    "this property led nishimori to suggest that the boundary between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases occurs at @xmath80 at sufficiently low temperature , and thus that the phase boundary is vertical in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane below the nishimori point , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nishi]a . later , kitatani @xcite arrived at the same conclusion by a different route , showing that the verticality of the phase boundary follows from an `` appropriate condition . '' these arguments , while suggestive , do not seem compelling to us .",

    "( for an application of this trick in a related setting , see @xcite . )    using this method , we can determine whether @xmath245 exceeds one for any @xmath234 and hence whether the sample @xmath58 is a success or a failure . generating many samples , we can estimate @xmath231 . in principle , then we can calculate the failure probability for the optimal recovery scheme , in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 obey nishimori s relation . by a similar method , we can calculate the failure probability for the rpgm .",
    "however , we have not attempted this calculation .",
    "the three - dimensional random - plaquette gauge model , and the analogous antisymmetric tensor models in higher dimensions , provide new examples of multicritical points with strong disorder .",
    "these models have phase diagrams that qualitatively resemble the phase diagram of the two - dimensional random - bond ising model .",
    "our results indicate that the boundary between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases of the rbim is reentrant rather than vertical below the nishimori line .",
    "if the disorder strength @xmath2 satisfies @xmath246 , then the ground state of the spin system does not have long - range order . as the temperature @xmath3 increases with @xmath2 fixed",
    ", long - range order is first restored , and then lost again as the temperature increases further . at @xmath6",
    "the spins are frozen in a disordered state driven by quenched randomness .",
    "but apparently this ground state is entropically unfavorable  at low but nonzero temperature typical states in the thermal ensemble have long - range ferromagnetic order .",
    "this behavior seems less remarkable when considered from the viewpoint of our error recovery protocol . for given @xmath2 and a specified error syndrome , the recovery method with optimal success probability proceeds by inferring the most likely homology class of errors consistent with the syndrome .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason for the most likely single error pattern ( the ground state ) to belong to the most likely error homology class ( the class with minimal free energy ) even in the limit of a large sample .",
    "our numerical results indicate that for error probability @xmath2 such that @xmath247 , the probability that the ground state does not lie in the most likely homology class remains bounded away from zero as @xmath150 .    in our numerical studies of the rbim and rpgm at zero temperature , we have computed a homological observable , the failure probability .",
    "this observable has advantages over , say , the domain wall energy , because it obeys a particularly simple finite - size - scaling ansatz .",
    "therefore , we have been able to determine the critical disorder strength @xmath5 and the critical exponent @xmath15 to good accuracy with relatively modest computational resources .",
    "not surprisingly , our numerical values for @xmath5 are notably larger than rigorous lower bounds derived using crude combinatoric arguments in @xcite : @xmath248 compared with the bound @xmath249 in the rbim , and @xmath250 compared with @xmath251 in the rpgm .    the zero - temperature critical disorder strength @xmath5 is a lower bound on the value of the critical disorder strength @xmath4 along the nishimori line , and of special interest because of its connection with the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information .",
    "our result means that stored quantum data can be preserved with arbitrarily good fidelity if , in each round of syndrome measurement , qubit errors and syndrome measurement errors are independently and identically distributed , with error probability per qubit and per syndrome bit both below @xmath252 . for qubit errors and measurement errors occuring at differing rates ,",
    "an accuracy threshold could be inferred by analyzing an anisotropic random - plaquette gauge model , with differing disorder strength for horizontal and vertical plaquettes .",
    "relating these threshold error rates to fidelity requirements for quantum gates requires further analysis of the sort discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have also measured the critical exponent @xmath15 that controls the divergence of the correlation length as @xmath2 approaches @xmath5 , finding @xmath253 in the rbim and @xmath254 in the rpgm .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is also relevant to the efficacy of quantum error correction  through its connection with finite - size scaling , @xmath15 determines how large the code block should be to achieve a specified storage fidelity , for @xmath2 less than but close to @xmath5 .",
    "quantum computers are believed to be more powerful than classical computers  classical computers are unable to simulate quantum computers efficiently .",
    "the accuracy threshold for quantum memory is a fascinating phase transition , separating a low - noise quantum phase from a high - noise classical phase . in this paper",
    ", we have described one way to analyze this phase transition using methods from traditional statistical physics .",
    "furthermore , the connection with quantum memory provides an enlightening new perspective on local spin and gauge systems with strong quenched disorder .",
