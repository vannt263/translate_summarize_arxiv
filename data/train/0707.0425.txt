    "in 1999 , p. wiegmann and a. zabrodin realised @xcite that conformal maps from the exterior of the unit disc to the exterior of a simple closed analytic curve admit as functions of the exterior harmonic moments @xmath0 of the analytic curve the structure of an integrable hierarchy : the dispersionless toda lattice hierarchy .",
    "( the toda lattice hierarchy was introduced by k. ueno and k. takasaki in @xcite .",
    "a review of the dispersionless toda lattice hierarchy can be found in @xcite . )    as was shown earlier by l .- l .",
    "chau and y. yu @xcite , the normal matrix model defined by the probability distribution @xmath1 on the space @xmath2 of all normal @xmath3 matrices with the potential @xmath4 gives rise to a solution of the toda lattice hierarchy . in @xcite ,",
    "this connection between normal matrix models and conformal maps was picked up and the authors showed that the eigenvalues in the large matrix limit homogeneously fill the interior of the analytic curve with the exterior harmonic moments @xmath0 and encircled area @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , all these results remain on the level of formal manipulations as in general already the integral in diverges .",
    "the purpose of this work is now to proof these statements in a mathematically rigorous setting . to this end , we will first of all introduce a cut - off for the divergent integral by restricting ourselves to the space of those normal matrices whose spectrum lies in some compact domain .",
    "furthermore , we will only consider polynomial potentials .",
    "then , only finitely many exterior harmonic moments are different from zero and so the corresponding curve is polynomial . since , at least for curves with small encircled area @xmath5 , we have a bijective relation between a polynomial curve and its harmonic moments , we finally can prove that , provided @xmath6 is small enough , in the large matrix limit the eigenvalues indeed homogeneously fill the interior of the polynomial curve uniquely determined by the exterior harmonic moments @xmath0 and the encircled area @xmath5 .    moreover , we find that the distribution of the zeros of the @xmath7-th orthogonal polynomial @xmath8 associated to this matrix model is in the limit @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 ( up to some constant ) given by the discontinuity of the schwarz function of the polynomial curve with area @xmath11 and exterior harmonic moments @xmath0 , provided the zeros in this limit are confined to some one - dimensional tree - like graph .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in chaper one we will introduce the considered matrix model and review a few standard methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) to characterise the distribution of the eigenvalues . in the second chapter , we will show that polynomial curves with small area are uniquely determined by its exterior harmonic moments ( for star - like domains this was already shown in @xcite ) .",
    "then , after having introduced the concept of the schwarz function ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we will end up with the connection between harmonic moments of a polynomial curve and its parametrisation , which we will see is given by the dispersionless toda lattice hierarchy .",
    "thereafter , we will consider the large matrix limit , in chapter three from a general point of view which is well know from potential theory @xcite , and in chapter four , we will apply those results to potentials of the form with only finitely many non - vanishing @xmath12 , leading us to the desired result that for small @xmath6 the eigenvalues homogeneously fill the interior of the polynomial curve determined by the exterior harmonic moments @xmath0 and the area @xmath5 . in the last chapter",
    ", we will analyse the behaviour of the orthogonal polynomials of these potentials in the continuum limit and will find that they obey the toda lattice hierarchy .",
    "finally , we will connect the limiting distribution of the zeros of the @xmath7-th orthogonal polynomial to the discontinuity of the schwarz function of the corresponding polynomial curve and calculate it explicitly for the gaussian and the cubic case .",
