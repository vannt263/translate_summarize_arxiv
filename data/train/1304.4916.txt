    "the stability and oscillations of a gas bubble suspended in a liquid under the influence of an acoustic driving pressure field in the ultrasonic frequency range have been the subject of a large volume of scientific literature  @xcite .",
    "studies on the system have been made from different viewpoints coming from its diverse applications and occurrences .",
    "ultrasound is routinely used in medical ultrasonography including echocardiography , lithotripsy , phacoemulsification , use in treatment of cancer and for dental cleansing .",
    "other significant applications of ultrasonic forcing of fluids in which studies of bubble dynamics and cavitation become very important are in sonochemistry , sonoluminescence , ultrasonic cleaning of materials , waste water treatment and in focussed energy weapons .",
    "cavitation events which involve violent collapse of micron - sized bubbles in the fluid can cause immense damage to the surfaces they are in contact with .",
    "studies of cavitation events in pumps , turbines , surfaces exposed to hydrodynamic flow , etc . , continue to be of immense interest in industries and in technological designs of devices .",
    "rayleigh s study of bubble cavitation was motivated by the need to understand and explain the damage to ships propellers  @xcite . under ultrasonic forcing",
    ", the behaviour of a bubble in a fluid depends heavily upon its ambient radius and the amplitude and frequency of the driving sound field .",
    "thus the bubble can show regular oscillatory behaviour which can be periodic or it can show highly irregular oscillations which are chaotic and of unpredictable amplitude . for applications where damage caused on surfaces due to bubble cavitation can be disastrous , such as in medicine",
    ", it is desirous to operate the sonic device in a `` safe '' regime , and / or to be able to have control over the bubble s motion .",
    "often in biological systems , it is known that bubbles in fluids can be electrostatically charged .",
    "studies of the dynamics governing the oscillations , growth and collapse of charged bubbles are therefore of immense relevance because of their prevalence in diverse applications and situations . experimental and theoretical work on",
    "the presence of charge on gas bubbles in fluids goes back to , for example , the work of mctaggart , alty and akulichev  @xcite , and more recently the work of shiran and watmough and atchley  @xcite .",
    "none of the work , though , has addressed the issue of dynamics of a charged bubble under ultrasonic forcing . + it is interesting to know what effect the presence of electric charge on the bubble would have and see if the motion of such a charged bubble forced by ultrasound would vary significantly from that of an electrically neutral bubble in a fluid .",
    "this especially becomes of practical significance when we are looking at cavitation phenomena in fluids in real - life , be it in the context of cavitation in mechanical systems or in the case of bubbles in fluids in living tissue in a medical context . apart from the work in  @xcite , we are not aware of any other studies in the literature of the dynamics of acoustically forced charged bubbles suspended in a fluid .",
    "their work however used the value @xmath8 for the polytropic constant which entailed cancellation of all the charged terms ; thus their work does not really address the issue of charge which it sets out to do .",
    "the extremely nonlinear nature of the system , and the presence of a large number of parameters do not facilitate a straightforward analysis and it becomes essential to take the aid of numerical methods to get an understanding of the dynamics governing the observed behaviour . in this work",
    "we report some studies on the dynamics of a charged bubble in a liquid ( which we take to be water ) when ultrasound is incident on it .",
    "we assume that heat transfer across the bubble takes place adiabatically , and the gas is a monatomic ideal gas .",
    "we therefore take the polytropic constant @xmath9 .",
    "+ in section ii we discuss briefly the nature of the radial dynamics of a charged bubble .",
    "starting with a modified rayleigh - plesset equation , we obtain the time series of the bubble radius as also of its radial velocity and temperature .",
    "we also calculate the phase portrait of the bubble , under different pressure regimes .",
    "+ in section iii we discuss the pressure thresholds that influence bubble dynamics ; we introduce the expansion - contraction ratio @xmath10 which we had introduced in  @xcite that enables us to locate the presence of the blake and upper transient threshold pressures easily when plotted as a function of the driving pressure amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "the effects of driving frequency @xmath2 and charge on @xmath10 are demonstrated in the present work .",
    "+ the influence of @xmath4 and @xmath2 on the bubble dynamics are investigated in detail in section iv .",
    "we obtain an expression for the minimum charge required on a bubble for radial oscillations to occur at some velocity @xmath1 , as also the dependence on the forcing pressure amplitude @xmath4 of the maximum forcing frequency @xmath3 at which an uncharged bubble will oscillate with velocity @xmath1 .",
    "+ we then obtain , in section v , the bifurcation diagrams for the system with driving frequency as the control parameter , and also the bifurcation diagram with charge as the control parameter .",
    "we observe that the presence of charge on the bubble advances period - doubling bifurcations with driving frequency as control parameter .",
    "increasing @xmath4 causes the advancement of period doubling and halving bifurcations for charged as well as uncharged bubbles , and bands of chaotic behavior are observed at large @xmath4 .",
    "+ the effect of charge and driving frequency on the maximal temperature are discussed in section vi .",
    "we note that the pressure regime in which the bubble is being forced ( whether @xmath4 is above or below the upper transient threshold pressure ) determines the frequency dependence of the temperature , and we obtain rough limits on the maximum charge a bubble may carry depending on its ambient radius .",
    "+ we conclude the paper with a summary of the results in section vii .",
    "in real - life situations , bubbles in fluids often have some electric charge sticking to them .",
    "this has been seen in the case of gas bubbles in various liquids as well as for cavitation events in water . in our work , we adapt the procedures for describing cavitation and forced bubble oscillations ( that has a long and extensive literature ) , to include the presence of charge .",
    "+ description of ultrasonically forced bubble motion in a fluid has been made through the rayleigh - plesset equation  @xcite and its variants  @xcite modified to take into account compressibility of the fluid or various other factors .",
    "proceeding as we did in our earlier work  @xcite , we further modify the form of the rayleigh - plesset equation for the evolution in time of the bubble radius @xmath11 employed by  @xcite to include the presence of a constant charge @xmath12 on the bubble as follows  @xcite : @xmath13    @xmath14 denotes the ambient equilibrium radius of the bubble , @xmath15 the static pressure , and @xmath16kpa , the vapour pressure of the gas .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 and @xmath17 respectively ( @xmath18 being the driving frequency ) , the amplitude and angular frequency of the ultrasound forcing field .",
    "we consider water to be the liquid surrounding the bubble , and having density @xmath19 , viscosity @xmath20 , surface tension @xmath21 , and the velocity of sound in the liquid @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the polytropic index and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "+ the modified rayleigh - plesset equation above can be simplified and rewritten in dimensionless form  @xcite as @xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the overdot here corresponds to differentiation with respect to @xmath32 , and where the following dimensionless constants have been used : @xmath33    we have employed the dimensionless form of the equations for obtaining their numerical solutions . in all the expressions that follow , and in the numerical results shown in graphs , we have rescaled the quantities by the appropriate factors and only displayed the dimensional form for a physical grasp of the magnitudes of the quantities involved . + the presence of charge @xmath12 counters the effect of surface tension , reducing its effective value , and induces several interesting changes to the dynamics of bubble oscillations . in a previous work  @xcite we had obtained for the charged bubble , the blake threshold and radius and also some results for the upper transient threshold for cavitation . in the following sections , we describe some interesting consequences of the presence of charge on a bubble .",
    "+ as the bubble expands and contracts , the surface charge density decreases or increases respectively .",
    "the presence of charge lowers the surface tension and for sub - micron sized bubbles , dominates over it , influencing the minimum and maximum values of the radius and the maximum velocities achieved by the bubble , and changing its point of collapse .",
    "a charged bubble achieves higher temperatures within it than an uncharged one , the collapse of the bubble being more violent in the charged case .",
    "+ the above results indicate that since the bubble oscillations are more energetic for the charged bubble , the temperature attained by the gas within the bubble during its oscillations , would be higher as well . to confirm this , we calculate the temperature using equation ( [ eqf ] )  @xcite .",

    "we use the expression in order to get an idea of the magnitudes achievable by the temperature in the presence of charge .",
    "to better visualize the effect that the amplitude of the forcing pressure @xmath4 and charge @xmath12 have on the bubble dynamics , we consider a bubble being driven at 20 khz , i.e. , the lower limit of the ultrasonic spectrum . even in this lowest ultrasonic regime ,",
    "the time series of bubble radius , radial velocity , and temperature all show an enhancement in values due to charge .",

    "the blake threshold determines the pressure threshold beyond which an acoustically forced bubble undergoes drastic expansion . after the blake threshold and preceding the onset of bubble collapse following a larger threshold known as the upper transient threshold , @xmath5 , the bubble is essentially in an unstable regime .",
    "+ depending upon whether the amplitude of the applied acoustic forcing pressure is greater or lesser than @xmath5 , the response of the bubble to the frequency of the applied pressure wave varies drastically .",
    "+ at low amplitudes of the forcing pressure ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) , increasing driving frequency causes a proportional increase in the bubble s maximum radial velocity @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath6 first decreases with increasing driving frequency upto a frequency @xmath58 , after which @xmath6 rises with frequency but with large oscillations .",
    "as could be expected from the above observations , a similar observation can be made regarding the maximum temperature @xmath7 of the gas inside the bubble .",
    "+ a useful graphical illustration of the transient threshold pressures , i.e. of the blake threshold ( @xmath52 ) and the upper transient threshold ( @xmath5 ) pressures , can be obtained by plotting @xmath59 as a function of the amplitude of driving pressure .",
