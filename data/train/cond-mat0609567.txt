    "there is a range of values of the strength of the confinement potential for which spontaneous interlayer phase coherence is stable in double quantum dots@xcite . outside this stability",
    "range the shape of the groundstate is expected to undergo a reconstruction@xcite .",
    "it is the competition between the confinement potential and the coulomb interaction which drives such a reconstruction .",
    "when the confinement potential weakens the repulsive coulomb interaction pushes electrons from each other , and can create density depletions inside the droplet .",
    "the interplay between the reconstruction and the formation of merons in the presence of an external potential is unclear .",
    "we investigated within a hartree - fock ( hf ) theory how merons nucleate in the groundstate when a lateral distortion with a reflection symmetry is present in the confinement potential@xcite .",
    "we found that when a sufficiently large distortion is present merons can be nucleated .",
    "both density depletions and merons can coexist in the reconstructed states . in the present work we demonstrate by integrating the electron density that these merons have total charge @xmath0 .",
    "in addition we present numerical evidence for the presence of edge merons , which appear to have a half - integer winding number .",
    "an electron in each dot is in a parabolic potential @xmath1 . in the strong magnetic field",
    "limit the energy of an electron with the angular momentum @xmath2 in a quantum dot is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the magnetic length . hereafter we will measure @xmath7 in units of @xmath8 , using @xmath9 which is a dimensionless quantity proportional to the confinement potential strength ( for gaas @xmath10)^2/(b[t])^{3/2}$ ] ) .",
    "the real spins of all electrons are assumed to be frozen aligning with the magnetic field .",
    "we consider a distortion in the confinement potential of the dot that may be generated by attaching a metallic stripe vertically on the cylindrical metallic gate surrounding the vertical quantum dots .",
    "the vertical distance between two dots is @xmath11 .",
    "let us make a simple model for this type of distortions .",
    "we take a separable form for the distortion potential @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the strength of the distortion .",
    "the matrix elements of this potential are @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes an electron with the angular momentum @xmath16 in the dot labeled by @xmath17 .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are defined as @xmath20 the parameter @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) denotes the strength of the matrix elements of the disorder potential between intra ( inter ) layer electrons . the wavefunctions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the left and right dot wavefunctions along the vertical direction .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 the first term of @xmath26 represents the confining energy due to the parabolic potential . in the second term",
    ", @xmath27 is the distortion potential . in the interaction hamiltonian @xmath28 , the term @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) represents the coulomb interaction potential between the electrons in the same ( different ) dots . in the spatial coordinates ,",
    "those interactions are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , where @xmath33 is the dielectric constant .",
    "the spontaneous interlayer phase coherent state ( maximum density droplet state@xcite ) , and meron excitations are well approximated by a hf theory@xcite .",
    "the pseudospin density is computed with the calculated density matrix .",
    "[ fig : density3d.g_0.085.vi_0.50 ] displays total electron densities for two different strengths of the lateral distortion with the center at the coordinate @xmath34 by a gaussian lateral potential with the range @xmath35 .",
    "results for @xmath36 are shown for two different strengths of the distortion @xmath37 .",
    "the maximum density is bigger than @xmath38 , which implies that the total local filling factor is bigger than one where the merons are located .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of merons with negative charges on the background of the total electron density @xmath38 . at @xmath39",
    "a meron is formed with the charge @xmath40 and vorticity @xmath41 .",
    "for the bigger value @xmath42 two merons appear and the vorticities for the lower and upper merons are @xmath41 and @xmath43 , respectively . integrating the electron density over the range that satisfy @xmath44 , we find the excess charges to be @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which indicates that one meron exists in the upper figure of fig .

[ fig : density3d.g_0.085.vi_0.50 ] . we have attempted to evaluate the total excess charge carried by the merons using the expression@xcite @xmath47,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the polarization vector @xmath48 is @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the pseudospin ) . however , this method gave inaccurate results .",
    "we believe this is because the expression is valid only for slowly varying pseudospin fields .",

    "we observe merons inside the dots .",
    "the values of the polarization @xmath54 at the meron cores are , within numerical accuracy , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that the charges should be @xmath40 since the vorticities of these two objects are opposite .",
    "the total charge of the merons is thus @xmath57 .",
    "note that there are also five density depletions inside the dots ( the open circles in the figure ) .",
    "these modulations of electron densities are not simply related to the shape of @xmath58 . since",
    "the densities are inhomogeneous the hf single particle potential must be included into consideration .",
    "it is non - trivial to anticipate the shape of the hf single particle potential since it reflects the delicate interplay between the hartree self energy , exchange self energy , and confinement potential@xcite .",
    "we also observe an edge meron near the edge in fig .",

    "we draw a circle around the center of this object and see how the in - plane pseudospins rotate along the circle .",
    "the in - plane pseudospins nearly flips as the half circle is followed inside the dot .",
    "the magnitude of in - plane pseudospin values decreases to zero as the edge region is passed .",
    "we believe thus that the edge meron has approximately a half integer winding number .",
    "it is complicated to calculate accurately the excess charge of the edge meron since the electron density varies strongly near the edge even in the absence of an edge meron .",
