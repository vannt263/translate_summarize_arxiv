    "rx  j0146.9 + 6121  is an accreting neutron star with a @xmath325 min spin period , the longest known period of any x - ray pulsar in a be - star system .",
    "this fact was realized ( mereghetti , stella & de nile 1993 ) only after the re  discovery of this source in the rosat all sky survey and its identification with the 11@xmath4 magnitude be star ls  i  + 61@xmath5  235 ( motch et al .",
    "indeed the 25 min periodicity had already been discovered with exosat ( white et al .",
    "1987 ) , but it was attributed to a nearby source ( 4u 0142 + 614 ; see also israel , mereghetti & stella 1994 , hellier 1994 ) .    the optical companion of rx  j0146.9 + 6121  was classified as b5iiie ( slettebak 1985 ) , but coe et al .",
    "( 1993 ) derived a somewhat earlier spectral type of o9b0 .",
    "this star is probably a member of the open cluster ngc 663 at a distance of about 2.5  kpc ( tapia et al . 1991 ) . for this distance ,",
    "the 120  kev luminosity during the exosat detection in 1984 was @xmath6  erg  s@xmath1 ( mereghetti , stella & de nile 1993 ) .",
    "all the observations of rx  j0146.9 + 6121  carried out after its re - discovery yielded lower luminosities , of the order of a few @xmath7  erg  s@xmath1 ( hellier 1994 , haberl et al .",
    "1998 ) , until an observation with the _ rossi_xte  satellite showed that in july 1997 the flux started to rise again ( haberl , angelini & motch 1998 ) , though not up to the level of the first exosat observation .    here",
    "we report on observations performed with the _ rossi_xte  ( bradt et al . 1993 ) and _ beppo_sax  ( boella et al . 1997a ) satellites from 1996 to 1998 .",
    "rx  j0146.9 + 6121  was observed with the _ rossi_xte  satellite on march 28 , 1996 from 11:17 ut to 22:11 ut .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected with the proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al .",
    "the pca instrument consists of an array of 5 proportional counters operating in the 260 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000  @xmath8 and a field of view , defined by passive collimators , of @xmath9 fwhm .    for the analysis of the pca data , time intervals with a source elevation angle greater than 10@xmath10 were selected , resulting in a net exposure time of about 18.5 ks .",
    "only the top layer anodes of the five proportional counters were used to accumulate spectra and light curves of rx  j0146.9 + 6121  .",
    "the background was estimated using the latest version of the program pcabackest applicable to the time period of our observation ( version 1.5 ) . to account for the uncertainties in the response matrix ( version 2.2.1 )",
    ", we added a 2% systematic error to the pha data .",
    "attempts to fit the pca spectrum with single component models gave unacceptable results , due to the presence of some contamination from the nearby source 4u  0142 + 614 .",
    "in fact the pca collimator ( strohmayer & jahoda 1998 ) has a transmission of about 58% at the off - axis angle of this pulsar ( @xmath324 ) . since the luminosity of 4u  0142 + 614 shows little or no variability on long timescales ( israel _ et al . _",
    "1999a ) we can estimate its contribution and model it in the spectral analysis . assuming the spectral parameters measured with asca ( white et al .",
    "1996 ; n@xmath11  @xmath12 , power law photon index @xmath13 = 3.67 , blackbody temperature kt = 0.386 kev ) and reducing the normalization according to the collimator response , we expect from 4u  0142 + 614 @xmath310 counts s@xmath1 in the 2 - 20 kev range .",
    "this corresponds to about 18% of the background - subtracted counts detected by the pca in the same energy range .",
    "due to the soft spectrum of 4u 0142 + 614 , its contribution rises to over 35% of the counts in the 2 - 4 kev range .",
    "therefore we included in the fits the contribution from 4u 0142 + 614 with spectral parameters fixed at the above values .    even taking the contribution from 4u 0142 + 614 into account",
    ", a single power law can not describe the spectrum of rx  j0146.9 + 6121  .",
    "the residuals show clear evidence for an iron k emission line and for a spectral turnover at energies above @xmath315 kev",
    ". a better fit can be obtained by adding to the model a gaussian emission line and an exponential cut - off ( or a broken power law ) to the model . the best fit spectrum is shown in fig .  1 and its parameters",
    "are reported in table 1 .",
    ".[mag ] results of the _ rossi_xte  pca spectral analysis .",
    "all errors represent 90% confidence limits after introducing the 2% systematic error . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "all the spin period measurements of rx  j0146.9 + 6121  have been collected in table 4 and are shown in fig .",
    "the first two values , obtained with exosat in 1984 and with rosat in 1993 , imply a spin - up of at least @xmath14 s s@xmath1 ( equivalent to a spin - up timescale of the order of @xmath3300 years ) .",
    "note that this is a lower limit , since we do not know at which time after the 1984 outburst the spin period reached the smaller value measured in recent observations . in contrast , all period measurements obtained after the rediscovery of this source are consistent with small fluctuations around a smaller average spin - up .",
    "a linear fit to the 1993 - 1998 data yields a value of @xmath15s s@xmath1 .",
    "this behaviour can be interpreted by assuming that the rapid spin - up following the 1984 outburst was due to large angular momentum transfer through an accretion disk in a phase of high accretion rate .",
    "indeed in 1984 rx  j0146.9 + 6121  had a luminosity of @xmath16 erg s@xmath1 , while in all subsequent measurements it showed luminosities at least a factor ten smaller .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.6 , where all published flux values are plotted as luminosities for a distance of 2.5 kpc and after the appropriate conversions to the 2 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "a flux increase of a factor 5 within one week was detected during the _ rossi_xte  observation of july 1997 ( haberl , angelini & motch 1998 ) , indicating the possible start of a new outburst from rx  j0146.9 + 6121  . as a consequence",
    "one might have expected a corresponding increase in the spin - up . however , our two _",
    "beppo_sax  measurements , obtained respectively one and six months later , did not show any significant variation in the spin period .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the july 1997 outburst was smaller ( in peak luminosity and possibly in length , see fig .",
    "6 ) than the 1984 one .    though our folded light curve of rx  j0146.9 + 6121  is similar to those reported from previous observations , the better statistics of our data allows to confirm the presence of significant substructure in the pulse profile .",
    "examples of this are the small dip in the main broad peak occurring at phase @xmath30.6 and the structure in phase interval d , which is visible mostly in the higher energy range .",
    "note that , although rx  j0146.9 + 6121  was brighter during the july 1997 _ rossi_xte  observation reported by haberl et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , on that occasion the source was observed at a large offset angle resulting in a reduced count rate .",
    "we finally note that , contrary to previous reports we do not find any evidence for a spectral cut - off at low energy .",
    "a spectral cut - off at @xmath34 kev was obtained by a combined spectral fit of non simultaneous _",
    "rossi_xte  and asca data ( haberl , angelini & white 1998 ) and interpreted as possible evidence for a relatively weak magnetic field of the order of a few 10@xmath17 g. our results indicate a cut - off value in the range usually observed in x  ray pulsars .    until recently rx  j0146.9 + 6121  and",
    "x persei had extreme properties among be x - ray pulsars , by virtue of their long spin period and relatively low luminosity .",
    "new x  ray and optical observations led to the discovery of a few other systems with similar characteristics : rx j0440.9 + 4431 , rx j1037.5564 ( reig & roche 1999 ) , 1wga j1958.2 + 3232 ( israel et al . 1998 ) , and possibly 1sax j0103.27209 ( israel et al . 1999b ) .",
    "these long period x - ray pulsating sources are characterized by relatively low and steady luminosities , in contrast with the brighter systems the discovery of which has been favoured in the past during their strong outbutsts .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , which shows the luminosity versus pulse period of the 44 x  ray pulsars with be companions currently known . for rx  j0146.9 + 6121  and the other similar sources mentioned above , we have indicated the observed range of luminosity values . for the other systems we have reported the maximum observed luminosity , since in most cases only upper limits or very uncertain values exist for their quiescent fluxes .",
    "note that fast spinning , magnetized neutron stars are not visible at low luminosities , owing to the action of the centrifugal barrier in preventing accretion onto the neutron star surface ( stella , white & rosner 1986 ) . on the other hand , neutron stars with spin periods",
    "longer than a few hundreds seconds can easily display pulsed emission at low accretion rates .",
    "future , more sensitive observations will further increase this sample that probably forms the bulk of the be / neutron star binaries .",
