    "a star cluster manifests itself as a density concentration of comoving stars in space . born out of the same molecular cloud , the member stars have roughly the same age , similar chemical composition , and are at essentially the same distance from us .",
    "star clusters , therefore , serve as good test beds to study stellar formation and evolution . in order to diagnose the properties of a star cluster , such as its age , distance , size , spatial distribution , mass function , etc .",
    ", it is necessary to identify as completely as possible the member stars . in particular , with a sample of members including the lowest mass stars , or even substellar objects , one could trace the dynamical history of an open cluster , e.g. , the effect of mass segregation , stellar evaporation , and tidal stripping in the galactic environment .",
    "nearby open clusters are useful in study of their low - mass population .",
    "praesepe ( m44 ; ngc2632 ; the beehive cluster ) is such a rich ( @xmath2 members ) and intermediate - age ( 757  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stellar aggregation in cancer , as a member in the hyades moving group @xcite , also called the hyades supercluster .",
    "compared to praesepe , the hyades cluster itself has a scattered main sequence in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) because of the significant depth with respect to its distance .",
    "the advantages of studying stars in praesepe are numerous .",
    "first , with a distance determination ranging from 170  pc @xcite to 184  pc @xcite , the cluster is close enough to detect low - mass stars or even brown dwarfs . in this work",
    ", we adopted a distance @xmath3  pc @xcite , and metallicity [ fe / h]=0.16 @xcite .",
    "second , the proper motion ( pm ) of the cluster is distinct from that of the field stars , so contamination is minimized when identifying member stars .",
    "third , in contrast to a star cluster at birth , for which the spatial distribution of members is governed by the parental cloud structure , the stellar distribution in an evolved cluster depends mainly on the interaction between members , from which we could investigate the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "early pm measurements of praesepe included the pioneering work by @xcite to identify bright members within a 1-deg radius of the cluster center , and by @xcite who extended the detection limit to @xmath4  mag to include intermediate - mass members .",
    "@xcite combined early data and presented a list of nearly 200 pm members . using pms and photometry , @xcite identified a list of member candidates from @xmath5 to 18  mag within 2  of the cluster center . using optical and infrared photometry , @xcite selected member candidates with mass @xmath6 and concluded a mass function similar to the field , with no evidence of stellar evaporation .",
    "@xcite summarized the photometric surveys of praesepe members down to the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "notably , @xcite , with a limiting magnitude of @xmath7  mag , thereby reaching the stellar mass of @xmath8  m@xmath1 , derived a rising mass function toward the low - mass end , and presented evidence of mass segregation @xcite . with the two micron",
    "all sky survey ( 2mass ) and digital sky survey data covering a sky area of 100  deg@xmath9 , @xcite extended the lower main sequence to 0.1  m@xmath1 , and determined the radial density profile of member stars . @xcite",
    "surveyed a sky area of 300  deg@xmath9 to identify members by optical to infrared spectral energy distribution , and by pm measurements taken from ucac2 for bright stars or calculated from usno - b1 and sdss positions , reaching almost into the brown - dwarf regime .",
    "their sample of early - type stars is incomplete because of the bright limit of ucac2 , whereas for later - type members the incompleteness is caused by the detection limits of usno - b1 and 2mass .",
    "recently @xcite used sdss and ppmxl data to characterize the stellar members , including the mass segregation effect and binarity",
    ".    there have been efforts to identify brown dwarfs in praesepe .",
    "@xcite covered one deg@xmath9 down to @xmath10  mag and identified 19 brown - dwarf candidates without spectral confirmation .",
    "@xcite presented deep optical and near - infrared observations covering 2.6  deg@xmath9 to a mass limit of 0.06  m@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite explored the central 0.6  deg radius region , reaching a limit of @xmath11  mag corresponding to @xmath00.050.13  m@xmath1 , and identified one substellar candidate .",
    "@xcite performed an optical @xmath12 band and near - infrared @xmath13 and @xmath14 band photometric survey covering 3.1  deg@xmath9 with detection limits of @xmath15  mag and @xmath16  mag , and found a handful of substellar candidates .",
    "the substellar census was augmented by @xcite who , using very deep optical ( @xmath17 and @xmath18-band ) photometry of the central 0.59  deg@xmath19 region of the cluster , identified a few dozen substellar member candidates .",
    "the first spectroscopically confirmed l dwarf member in praesepe was secured by @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass function of praesepe was found to rise until 0.1  m@xmath1 @xcite , in contrast to the hyades , which have about the same age but are deficient of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "possible explanations include different initial mass functions for the two clusters , or that praesepe somehow did not experience as much dynamical perturbation in its environments @xcite . a recent study with the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) galactic clusters survey derived a declining mass function toward lower masses @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to secure a sample of highly probable members to address this issue .    the spatial distribution of star in a cluster is initially governed by the structure in the parental molecular cloud .",
    "as a star cluster ages , gravitational scattering by stellar encounters results in mass segregation @xcite ; that is , massive stars tend to concentrate toward the center of the cluster , whereas lower mass stars , with a greater velocity dispersion , are distributed out to greater radii .",
    "for praesepe , @xcite combined their observations , complete to @xmath20  mag and @xmath21  mag , with those of @xcite with @xmath22  mag , to show a clear mass segregation effect .",
    "while brown dwarfs may have a preferred spatial distribution within a young star cluster @xcite , they tend to be distributed uniformly as the cluster evolves @xcite .",
    "observational attempts to find and characterize members in a star cluster often are sufficiently deep but limited in sky coverage , or cover wide areas but are restricted to only brighter ( more massive ) members .",
    "studies with large sky coverages usually secure membership on the basis of photometry , lacking pm measurements for faint members . in this paper",
    ", we present photometric ( 2mass and pan - starrs ) and astrometric ( ppmxl ) diagnostics to select the member candidates in praesepe .",
    "our sample allows us to characterize the cluster including the binarity , its size , the mass function and the segregation effect .",
    "we describe the photometric and pm data in section  [ sec : data ] , and how we identified probable members in section  [ sec : selection ] .",
    "the discussion is in section  [ sec : dis ] , for which we compare our results with those in the literature .",
    "the binarity is discussed , and evidence of mass segregation and tidal stripping is presented .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary as section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "data used in this study include photometry and pm measurements within a 5-deg radius around the praesepe center ( r.a.=@xmath23 , decl.@xmath24 , j2000 ) .",
    "archival data were taken from the 2mass point sources catalog , ppmxl , and pan - starrs .",
    "the 2mass point source catalog @xcite has the 10@xmath25 detection limits of @xmath26  mag , @xmath27  mag , and @xmath28  mag , and saturates around 45  mag .",
    "the typical astrometric accuracy for the brightest unsaturated sources is about 7080  mas .",
    "ppmxl is an all - sky merged catalog based on the usno - b1 and 2mass positions of 900 million stars and galaxies , reaching a limiting @xmath29  mag @xcite .",
    "the typical error is less than 2  milliarcseconds ( mas ) per year for the brightest stars with tycho-2 @xcite observations , and is more than 10  mas  yr@xmath30 at the faint limit .",
    "pan - starrs ( the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ) is a wide field ( 7  deg@xmath9 ) imaging system , with a 1.8  m , f/4.4 telescope @xcite , equipped with a 1.4 giga - pixel camera @xcite . the prototype ( ps1 ) , located atop haleakala , maui , usa @xcite , has been patrolling the entire sky north of @xmath31 declination since mid-2010 . repeated observations of the same patch of sky with a combination of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 bands several times a month produce a huge inventory of celestial objects that vary in brightness or in position .",
    "deep static sky images and catalog of stars and galaxies are also obtained .",
    "the ps1 filters differ slightly from those of the sdss @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 filter extends 20  nm redward of @xmath37 for greater sensitivity and lower systematics for photometric redshift estimates .",

    ", ps1 will provide reliable photometry and astrometry . while incremental photometry of ps1 is available at the moment , the calibration of astrometry ,",
    "hence the pm measurements , will need yet to tie down the entire sky , so no ps1 pm data were used here .",
    "the photometric analysis and calibration is described in @xcite .",
    "ps1 photometry for each detected object has measurements at multiple epochs , but for the work reported here only the average magnitude is used . in our study , we therefore made use of the 2mass photometry for stars too bright for ps1 , plus the ps1 photometry for faint stars , and the ppmxl pms to select and characterize stellar member candidates . in matching counterparts in different star catalogues ,",
    "one arcsecond was used as the coincidence radius among ppmxl , ps1 , and 2mass sources .",
    "our membership diagnosis relies on grouping in sky position , in pms , and along the isochrones appropriate for the cluster in the infrared and optical cmds .",
    "the sources with 2mass photometric uncertainties greater than 0.05  mag , roughly reaching @xmath45  mag , @xmath46  mag , and @xmath47  mag , were removed from the sample .",
    "candidacy was then further winnowed in the @xmath13 versus @xmath48 cmd by including only objects with @xmath48 colors within 0.3  mag from the padova isochrones @xcite .",
    "this initial , wide range of colors allowed us not to adopt an _ a priori _ stellar evolutionary model , but in turn to put different models to test , as demonstrated below .    with the initial photometric sample",
    ", we then identified stars with pms close to that of the cluster .",
    "obviously the choice of the range is a compromise between the quality and the quantity of the candidate list .",
    "the optimal range was decided by how the cluster grouping is blended with the field .",
    "the ppmxl data toward praesepe are shown in figure  [ fig : ppmxl2deg ] .",
    "the pm distribution has two peaks , one for the cluster ( @xmath49masyr@xmath30 , @xmath50masyr@xmath30 ) and the other for field stars ( @xmath51masyr@xmath30 , @xmath52masyr@xmath30 ) .",

    "the average pm we adopted for the cluster is close to those listed by simbad , @xmath53masyr@xmath30 , and @xmath54masyr@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "naturally , around the peak of the cluster , the distribution is dominated by members , and away from the peak the contamination by field stars becomes prominent .",

    "only stars spatially within the central @xmath55 are displayed here for clarity .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we exercised two levels of pm selection .",
    "first , a gaussian function was fitted to the secondary ( cluster ) peak . even through the distribution",
    "is known to be non - gaussian @xcite , the top part of the peak can be reasonably approximated by a gaussian with a standard deviation of 9masyr@xmath30 .",
    "this is the pm range , namely within @xmath56masyr@xmath30 of the cluster s average pm , that we adopted to select pm membership .",
    "this range is similar to that used by @xcite ( 8masyr@xmath30 ) or by @xcite ( 8masyr@xmath30 in @xmath57 and 12masyr@xmath30 in @xmath58 ) .",
    "we note that @xcite derived , using relative pms on the basis of the ukidds data , a different mean motion ( @xmath59masyr@xmath30 , @xmath60masyr@xmath30 ) .",
    "the discrepancy may arise because these authors used the median value to choose the center of the pm range , yet the distribution is skewed because of the contribution from the field .",
    "the next level of pm selection is @xmath61masyr@xmath30 , at which there is about the same contribution from the cluster and from the field , i.e. , a 50% contamination of the sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : pmtrans ] compares the cases of 4 versus 9masyr@xmath30 .",
    "while bright candidates , including giant stars , are not much affected by the choice , the cluster sequence clearly stands out with the narrower pm range even without restrictions on position , color , or magnitude .",
    "the adoption of @xmath62masyr@xmath30 facilitates comparison between our results and previous works .",
    "but the @xmath63masyr@xmath30 sample was still kept for a more reliable selection of candidates .",

    "another highly probable member suggested by @xcite , j084039.3@xmath100192840 , already refuted by @xcite because of its ( @xmath195 ) color , is indeed not in our candidate list . of the six brown dwarf candidates proposed by (",

    "@xcite identified , but not tabulated , 24 _ hipparcos _ members in praesepe . with the identifications kindly provided by van leeuwen",
    ", we confirm that they are all enlisted in our candidate sample .",
    "the blue stragglers in the cluster suggested by @xcite , hd73666 , hd73819 , hd73618 , hd73210 , too bright for ps1 , are all confirmed to be pm members .",
    "our photometric selection precludes the white dwarfs known in the cluster @xcite .",
    "they are too faint for 2mass but have been recovered by ppmxl and ps1 , illustrated in figure  [ fig : compjjkggy ] .",
    "one additional white dwarf candidate is identified in our data ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 , j2000 ; @xmath202  masyr@xmath30 , @xmath203  masyr@xmath30 ) with @xmath204  mag , and @xmath205  mag .",
    "the white dwarf members follow the general cooling sequence from brighter / bluer to fainter / redder in the cmd .",
    "scaled with white dwarfs in the field , studied by @xcite also with ps1 data , the ones in praesepe have a cooling time scale of 0.20.4  gyr .",
    "a binary system with identical component stars would have the brightness of either star overestimated by 0.75  mag .",
    "a binary sequence therefore is often seen as a swath up to 0.70.8  mag above the main sequence of a star cluster in a cmd .",
    "multiple systems may have even larger magnitude differences . @xcite and",
    "@xcite estimated a multiplicity of @xmath206 for low - mass members in praesepe . in both the 2mass and ps1 cmds ( see figure  [ fig : memjjkggy ] ) , the binary sequence stands out clearly .",
    "such a distinct binary sequence was already noticed by @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath13 versus @xmath48 main sequence is characterized by a slanted upper part and turns nearly vertically below the mass of @xmath207  m@xmath1 . while the upper main sequence allows us to gauge the distance ( shifting vertically )",
    ", the vertical segment provides a convenient tool to estimate the reddening of a cluster ( shifting horizontally ) .",
    "this fact , however , also means the @xmath13 versus @xmath48 cmd can not be used to evaluate the binarity at the lower main sequence .",
    "instead , the ps1 cmd shows a monotonic track , so is useful for this purpose .",
    "there is no clear dividing line above the main sequence to separate binaries from single stars .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : memjjkggy ] demonstrates a magnitude difference of 0.5  mag above the main sequence as the dividing line . in this case",
    ", there are 242 stars above the line , or a binary fraction of about 23% of the total 1040 member candidates .",
    "no attempt was made to estimate separately the binarity of the 872 true member versus the 168 interloper samples .",
    "if the difference is lower to 0.4  mag or 0.3  mag , the number increases , respectively , to 302 ( 29% ) or 389 ( 37% ) .",
    "the relatively small increase in the binary fraction is the consequence of a distinct binary sequence of this cluster ; that is , the binaries in praesepe tend to be of similar - mass systems , as noted , for example , by @xcite .",
    "praesepe also seems to teem with multiple systems , as concluded by @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted an elaborative analysis on the binarity . adopting a brightness range from 0.376 to 1.5  mag above the ( single star ) main sequence",
    ", these authors derived a binary frequency of @xmath208 for the mass range of 0.45 to 0.2  m@xmath1 , @xmath209 for 0.2 to 0.1  m@xmath1 , and @xmath210 for 0.1 to 0.07  m@xmath1 .",
    "given the uncertainties in membership and binarity assignments , our data do not justify division of the sample into different mass bins , and we infer an overall binary frequency ( or multiplicity ) of at least 2040% .      the stellar mass was interpolated via a least - square polynomial fitting to the @xmath13 ( if too bright in ps1 ) or @xmath32 magnitude using the compilation of @xcite ( their table  5 ) , and adopting a distance modulus of 6.26  mag .",
    "the @xmath32 band observations saturate around @xmath211  mag , corresponding to @xmath212  mag in our sample , or about 0.6  m@xmath1 .",
    "the masses of our candidates range from @xmath213  m@xmath1 to @xmath214  m@xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity function of the cluster was derived by subtraction of the field contamination . for field stars",
    ", we selected the stars satisfying the same pm and isochrone criteria , but with angular distance between @xmath89 and @xmath68 from the cluster center . in figure",
    "[ fig : glf ] , the @xmath32 luminosity function of the member candidates listed in table  [ tab : members ] is subtracted by that of the field . the field distribution is flat , as expected , and contributes only as a small correction to the observed luminosity function .",
    "the corrected luminosity function rises spuriously near the ps1 saturation limit of @xmath2151115  mag , and then turns around near @xmath216  mag , or mass @xmath217  m@xmath1 .",
    "the mass function of praesepe members is shown in figure  [ fig : mf ] .",
    "we note that this is the mass function for the stellar systems , i.e. , with no binary correction . using optical @xmath12 band and near - infrared @xmath13 and @xmath14 photometric data , @xcite reported a rising mass function in the range from 0.6  m@xmath1 to 0.1  m@xmath1 then turning over , in agreement with previous works , e.g. , by @xcite .",
    "this increase in number with decreasing mass was shown by @xcite to continue into the brown dwarf regime , peaking around @xmath218  m@xmath219 then decrease until about @xmath220  m@xmath219 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also derived a rising , but flatter , mass function . on the other hand , @xcite , using also the ukidss photometry , but adding additional proper motion information , obtained an opposite result , namely , a declining mass function between 0.6  m@xmath1 and 0.1  m@xmath1 , different from those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our sample is more complete at the higher mass end than that by @xcite , but otherwise the mass function is consistent with theirs for stellar masses greater than around 0.3  m@xmath1 .",
    "overall , the mass function we obtained resembles that of the disk population @xcite for the massive part , but shows a deficit of the lowest mass population ( @xmath221  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "luminosity function of member candidates ( the red dash line ) is subtracted by the field population with the same photometric and pm selection criteria ( blue dotted line ) to derive the corrected cluster luminosity function ( solid blue line ) .",
    "the corresponding stellar mass is labeled at the top in unit of solar mass . ,",
    "scaledwidth=60.0% ]          even the youngest star clusters may have elongated shape @xcite , likely a consequence of filamentary structure in the parental clouds .",
    "subsequent encounters among member stars then circularize the core of a cluster .",
    "mass segregation occurs as energy losing massive stars sink to the center , whereas lower - mass members gain energies and occupy a larger volume in space .",
    "some stars may gain sufficient speed so as to escape the system .",
    "the lowest mass members are particularly vulnerable to such stellar `` evaporation '' .",
    "as the cluster evolves , the internal gravitational pull becomes weaker and external disturbances , such as differential rotation , or tidal force from passing molecular clouds and from the galactic disk , act together to distort the shape of a cluster and eventually tear it apart .",
    "the deformation and tidal stripping are effective even for globular clusters @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : segr ] shows how the stellar mass correlates with the spatial distribution .",
    "the radial density profiles have been computed for four different mass groups :  m / m@xmath222 ( 129 stars ) , m / m@xmath2230.20.35 ( 256 stars ) , m / m@xmath2230.350.7 ( 332 stars ) , and m / m@xmath224 ( 323 stars ) .",
    "the top panel shows the observed density profiles , while the bottom panel compares the normalized profiles .",
    "because of the normalization , no correction of the field contamination is necessary .",
    "relatively massive members appear to be centrally concentrated , whereas lower mass members are more scattered spatially , a result of mass segregation .",
    "mass segregation in praesepe was well demonstrated already by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our result is consistent with that by @xcite from 0.85  m@xmath1 to 0.15  m@xmath1 .",
    "when the radial density distribution shown in figure  [ fig : segr ] is parameterized with an exponential form , @xmath225 , the least - squared fitting yields @xmath226 ( for members @xmath227 ) , 0.96 ( 0.350.7  m@xmath1 ) , and 0.42 ( 0.20.35  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that a power - law function may be more appropriate . in any case , for the faintest sample",
    ", the density distribution is certainly not exponential .",
    "instead , it exhibits a sharp truncation beyond 1 .",
    "we interpret this as a consequence of stellar evaporation .",
    "this further supports the notion of a relative lack of low - mass stars in praesepe , as already demonstrated in figure  [ fig : mf ] .",
    "mass segregation is further manifested by the positional ( figure  [ fig : pos ] ) and pm distributions ( figure .",
    "[ fig : vel ] ) of the members ; namely , relatively massive members are concentrated in a smaller volume in space , and have a smaller velocity dispersion than lower - mass stars .",
    "the average stellar mass in our sample is @xmath228  m@xmath1 , close to that for a miller - scalo initial mass function . with the total number of members @xmath229 , the total stellar mass in the cluster",
    "then amounts to at least @xmath230 .",
    "the lowest mass stars , with a declining mass function , do not contribute significantly to the total mass . with a radius @xmath231  pc ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of the cluster then would be @xmath232  km  s@xmath30 , which is noticeably less than the typical value of 12  km  s@xmath30 for galactic open clusters . at the assumed distance of 179",
    "pc to praesepe , an intracluster pm dispersion of 1  mas  yr@xmath30 corresponds to a velocity dispersion of 0.8  km  s@xmath30 .",
    "our data thus are not precise enough to measure any pm gradient among members .",
    "the evidence is mounting that praesepe is dissolving .",
    "it is spatially extended with a sparse stellar density .",
    "@xcite suggested that praesepe might consist of two merging clusters .",
    "the relatively high fraction of equal mass pairs ( and of multiples ) may be the consequence of occasional stellar ejection during three - body encounters @xcite , or during the merging process .",
    "relevant time scales for a dissolving star cluster include : ( @xmath233 )  the dynamical ( crossing ) time scale , @xmath234 , ( @xmath235 )  the relaxation time , @xmath236 , and ( iii )  the evaporation time , @xmath237 @xcite . for praesepe ,",
    "these time scales are @xmath238  yr , @xmath239  yr , and @xmath240  yr , respectively .",
    "the lowest - mass members , having an average escape probability @xcite several times of that for the most massive stars , are particularly susceptible to ejection .",
    "the praesepe cluster therefore is almost fully relaxed , and tidal stripping has occurred , starting with the lowest mass members being witnessed to escape from the cluster .        .",
    "we have conducted a photometric and proper motion selection of member stars of the galactic open cluster praesepe , using 2mass , ppmxl and pan - starrs data .",
    "our sample is comprehensive in terms of sky area ( 3  radius ) , limiting magnitude ( @xmath241  mag ) , and reliability ( @xmath242 false positive rate ) .",
    "a total of 1040 member candidates are identified , 872 of which are highly probable members , down to about 0.1 solar masses . while for members more massive than 0.6  m@xmath1 , the padova isochrone works well , the bt - settl atmospheric model fits better toward fainter magnitudes .",
    "the binary frequency of praesepe members is about 2040% , with a relatively high occurrence of similar mass pairs .",
    "the mass function is consistent with that of the disk population , but with a deficit of stars less massive than 0.3  m@xmath1 .",
    "members show a clear evidence of mass segregation , with the lowest mass population being evaporated from the system . at the faint magnitude end , the bottleneck of membership selection for very faint objects remains the sensitivity of the pm measurements .",
    "once the ps1 completes its survey in early 2014 , increasing the photometric depth and the stellar pm baseline to more than 3.5 years , we expect to secure member lists for nearby star clusters well into the substellar regime .",
