    "one of the most topical applications in use of affect irradiation onto living organisms might be photodynamical therapy ( pdt ) combined with positron annihilation methods .",
    "pdt utilizes light of any waveband in combination with a photosensitizing agent to induce a phototoxic reaction which results with damage or death of pathogenic cells .",
    "antibacterial pdt , directed against bacterial and yield cells , has most demonstrative evidence in dermatology @xcite . at present , pdt is a main competitor for the antibiotical cure .",
    "if penicillin , discovered by fleming in 1928 , was not spread out in medicine , pdt would not be forgotten at a long date .",
    "photosensitizing reactions in pdt are the processes , in which absorption of light by a photosensitizer ( or a dye ) induces chemical changes in the outer wall at the surface of several types of bacterial and yeast cells , increases their permeability , and allows significant amounts of photosensitizer to be accumulated at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane .",
    "two types of such reactions may carry out , either via radical mechanism ( type i ) or energy migration to produce reactive singlet oxygen ( type ii ) .",
    "the target cells of bacteria are classified to gram - positive ( gram ( + ) , e.g. murein sacculus ) and gram - negative ( gram ( - ) , e.g. escherichia coli ( _ e . coli _ ) ) , they differ in structure and thickness of the peptidoglycan layer . the positive charge of the dye appears to promote a tight electrostatic interaction with negatively charged sites at the outer surface of any species of bacterial cells .",
    "singlet oxygen @xmath0o@xmath1 was first observed in 1924 . in 1931 , kautsky first proposed that @xmath0o@xmath1 might be a reaction intermediate in dye - sensitized photooxygenation @xcite .",
    "singlet oxygen is metastable states of triplet oxygen ( o@xmath1 ) with more high energy is less stable than triplet oxygen ( o@xmath1 ) .",
    "the energy difference between the lowest energy of singlet state and the lowest energy of triplet state is about 11400 k ( @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) = 0.98 ev ( = 94.2 kj / mol ) ) and corresponds to the transition in near - infrared at @xmath4 1270 nm .",
    "the theory of molecular orbital predicts three low - lying excited singlet states of triplet molecular oxygen o@xmath5 : o@xmath6 , o@xmath7 , and o@xmath8 , which differ in only spins and occupation of antibonding degenerated @xmath9 orbitals . amid these states ,",
    "namely o@xmath6 is called `` singlet oxygen '' as non - degenerated and more long - living state .",
    "because of the differences in the electron shells , singlet and triplet oxygen differ in their chemical properties .",
    "lifetime of singlet oxygen in vacuum equals 72 min and significantly decreases in dependence on a media .",
    "singlet oxygen reacts with many kinds of biological molecules such as dna , proteins and lipids @xcite .",
    "some notions to develop pas as a new noninvasive technique for the detection of molecular damage by uv radiation have issued in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the experiments on uv irradiated mouse s @xcite and cancer - diseased @xcite skin strikingly demonstrate the perspectives of positron annihilation spectroscopy ( pas ) in medicine .",
    "there were observed , that the long - living @xmath10-ps is trapping into the 10 - 15 nm depth of the outer cell layer @xcite .",
    "these scales imply to be comparable to penetration of photoinactivated dye oxygen into the outer layer of gram - negative bacteria , which is of just appropriate to porine and lipopolysaccharide size .",
    "these data motivate the consideration the perspectives of positrons and ps in the pdt use . to future experimental confirmations and medical applications , we rest here at the evaluation of positronium states for photoirradiated _ e. coli _ and the porphyrin photosentizer , 4 n  methyl - pyridinium ( meso ) ( t@xmath11mpyp ) , in the presence of the tris - edta agent .",
    "consider the photosensitization of _ e. coli _ with visible light of 250 w tungsten lamps for t@xmath11mpyp due to the pdt action ( figures 1 , 2 ) .",
    "the presence of the tris - edta agent @xcite , @xcite in the system might be useful to enhancing of the membrane permeability and facilitating the penetration of phototoxic molecules to the cytoplasmic membrane .",
    "the addition of tris - edta to gram ( - ) bacteria removes the divalent cations ( e.g. ca@xmath12 , mg@xmath12 ions ) which are present in large numbers to stabilize adjacent negative charged lipopolysaccharides molecules at the outer membrane .",

    "biochemical analysis performed on irradiated cells suggest that the cytoplasmic membrane is an important target of the photo - process @xcite . to reach this membrane from the outside ,",
    "singlet oxygen have to destroy an outer cell layer ( figure 2 ) .",
    "in particular , the result of its damage should be phase transformations or the pore formation of the outer lipidic layer of a cell . in this respect , dppc @xcite and stratum corneum @xcite",
    "have been studied with the doppler - broadening and pals techniques ( without specific therapeutic applications ) .    consider the main results of photo - destructive reactions of photosentizers in the bacterial layer structure and chemical agents , and the positronium formation after that .",

    "one of gram ( + ) bacteria @xcite , stratum corneum , was studied with pals to qualify the pore diameters .",
    "more specifically , yucatan miniature pig stratum corneum , separated with heat , was irradiated with polycarbonate ( of positron annihilation lifetime 2.103@xmath810.076 ns ) due to sandwich scheme with the @xmath86na source 0.51 mev before samples ( 15@xmath8715@xmath870.5 mm ) isolated by the enveloping aluminium foil .",
    "as it has been generally known , the thickness of an outer layer of gram ( + ) bacteria is 15 - 80 nm ( figure 2 ) .",
    "there , pore diameters ( from 0.54 to 0.6 nm ) in cyclodextrins and polycarbonats were measurable with pals by means of an application of the well - known tao - eldrup formula .",
    "in contrast to stratum corneum , a gram ( - ) bacterium has an outer layer of the 10 - 15 nm thickness , and shows low level of photosensitivity , perhaps due to highly organized outer wall , including murein and a trilamellar structure outside of the peptidoglycan layer @xcite .",
    "therefore , to increase the permeability of gram ( - ) bacteria , the biological agent such as t@xmath11mpyp is involving in pdt procedures .",
    "so , the logarithmic decrease in the overall survival of _ e. coli _ cells irradiated in the presence of the 8.4@xmath13 m t@xmath11mpyp porphyrin is 4.5 after 10 min irradiation .",

    "typical pals experiments with living systems ( @xcite , @xcite etc ) are carried out in frames of the sandwich type configuration of a sample with the positron source ( for example , @xmath86na ) .",
    "however , such a construction does not allow to study a living system in an equivalent to a living media an aqueous aggregation , and also causes troubles in delivery of light from a laser or a lamp .",
    "an alternative bulk construction schemes of a samples in ampules , applicable for liquids on the whole , are described , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the above arguments have proved the possibility of control with positron spectroscopy of states of outer membrane layers in bacterial cells irradiated in pdt .",
    "the next conclusions have been made .",
    "\\1 . as the lifetime order of magnitudes for @xmath10-ps and @xmath0o@xmath1 is comparable and different for an each medium ( with the exception of water ) , hence",
    ", one may measure the ps lifetime during the photoinactivation by singlet oxygen during the pdt procedure .",
    "the scenario involving the reactions of singlet oxygen of pdt into pals might be directly tested on the gram ( + ) bacterial system @xcite and spread out onto gram ( - ) bacteria .",
