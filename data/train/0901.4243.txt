    "a clear signal of the new physics ( np ) that lies beyond the standard model ( sm ) would be the existence of heavy new particles or `` resonances '' . in tev mass range , the main arena of search for these objects",
    "will soon be the cern lhc experiments as these particles can be produced or exchanged in high energy collisions .",
    "the direct experimental evidence for a resonance is the peak in the energy dependence of the measured cross sections seen above the sm background .",
    "once the resonance signal is observed , further analysis is needed to distinguish between scenarios that potentially may cause this effect .",
    "first step in this analysis would be the determination of the spin of the resonance which provides an important selection among different classes of non - standard interactions . in the second step ,",
    "then , one should test how likely this signal is accounted for by a certain np model based on the parameter space of the model , particle spectrum and production mechanism(s ) for the observed resonance .    in this",
    "regard , suppose lhc will observe a resonance in the @xmath2 1.5 - 2 tev mass range in the zz invariant mass distribution in the pp @xmath3 zz @xmath3 4 charged leptons mode .",
    "now , what could be the underlying theory that is responsible for this resonance ?    as a first possibility , recall @xcite that the first kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode of the spin-2 graviton from randall - sundrum ( rs ) extra - dimensional model @xcite may well account for this enhancement .",
    "the reason is that for graviton with mass in the range @xmath2 1.5 - 2 tev , the graviton production via gluon fusion with subsequent decay to longitudinal z boson pair is significantly dominating over all other possible sources within the rs model . in particular , the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) production mode is found to be about an order of magnitude smaller for this mass range @xcite .",
    "however , it is hard to reach the graviton mass bigger than @xmath2 2 tev as the graviton cross - section is small and the irreducible sm background to pp @xmath3 zz is starting to dominate for higher graviton masses .    another spin-2 candidate for the enhancement in the @xmath2 1.5 - 2 tev mass range in this mode is the tensor bound state of some strongly - coupled technicolor ( tc ) theory @xcite produced via vbf and decaying to the longitudinal z boson pair .",
    "such spin-2 resonance plays also an important role in these tc models since it helps to delay unitarity violation in the longitudinal @xmath4 and @xmath5 scatterings . in these scatterings , spin-1 isospin-1",
    "( technirho ) vector resonance will appear only in the @xmath6 and @xmath7-channels in the @xmath4 scattering and will not appear in the @xmath8 scattering at all .",
    "also , in the tc theories we will consider , the lightest spin-0 resonance is expected to be lighter than @xmath2 1 tev @xcite .",
    "finally , due to the parity conservation , the axial resonance can not directly participate in these tree - level scatterings either .",
    "this leaves the lightest spin-2 tc bound state as a strong candidate to account for the assumed - to - be - observed resonance .",
    "thus , in this paper we start with the assumption that there is indeed a spin-2 resonance observed and refer to other studies for discrimination techniques between spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 resonances @xcite .",
    "we will argue that due to the different production modes for the spin-2 states in rs and tc theories , it is possible to distinguish these models based on the angular analysis of the reconstructed longitudinal z bosons",
    ".    we will consider three different tc scenarios : minimal walking tc ( mwt ) @xcite , next to mwt ( nmwt ) @xcite and qcd - like tc theory .",
    "first two models have received significant attention in the literature due to the fact that these models successfully pass the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , mwt leads to new candidates for cold dark matter @xcite and , with addition of modest amount of tc - neutral matter , also to a novel unification of the sm couplings @xcite . in all of these tc theories",
    ", the technimatter will be singlet under qcd and , thus , the vbf will be the dominant production mechanism for the spin-2 bound state .",
    "parameters of the tc theories will be chosen such as to preserve the unitarity up to at least ( m@xmath9 + 0.4 tev ) and to account for the experimental evidence of the resonance .",
    "once this is accomplished , we will mimic the same resonance in the rs model and compare the angular distributions of reconstructed z bosons from both theories . due to the different production mechanisms",
    "the angular distributions will be different and we will see that , in a long run , lhc will have a fair chance to conclusively distinguish between spin-2 states from tc and rs theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss how the different production mechanisms for the spin-2 state reveal themselves in the angular distributions of the longitudinal z bosons . in section",
    "iii we present the amplitudes for the @xmath4 and @xmath8 scatterings and specify the parameters values for the three tc models we consider based on the unitarity and consideration of modified weinberg sum rules ( wsr ) . in parallel with section iii , section iv deals with the amplitudes and the parameters for the rs model . in section",
    "v we present our numerical results relevant for lhc phenomenology .",
    "final discussions and conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "in this section we show how the angular distribution of the reconstructed z bosons is connected to the production mechanism for the spin-2 resonance .",
    "such resonance has the total of five possible polarization states , but gluons can produce only @xmath10 and @xmath11 since gluons do not have longitudinal polarizations and the total angular momentum has to be equal to @xmath12 ( where we have chosen beam axis to be in the z - direction ) . now , suppose that the two gauge bosons from the decay of the resonance are produced at the polar angle @xmath13 .",
    "we rotate the gluon - produced resonance state specified by polarization tensor @xmath14 by this angle @xcite :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 corresponds to the resonance state with the z - axis aligned with the direction of the decay products , and @xmath17 is the familiar wigner @xmath18-matrix .",
    "independent wigner small @xmath19-matrix elements for the spin-2 state are presented in the appendix for completeness , see also @xcite .",
    "now we may easily derive the angular dependence of the helicity amplitudes for the channels appearing in our analysis .",
    "they follow from eq.([rotation ] ) for the @xmath20 resonance state which is produced either by two @xmath21 or by two @xmath22 gluon states :    @xmath23    now just use clebsch - gordan decomposition of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states in terms of 1@xmath261 final spin states to observe that , for example , helicity amplitude @xmath27\\equiv   { \\mathcal{a}}_{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 \\lambda_4}$ ] for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "notice that we have not included the @xmath31 and @xmath32 terms in eq.([decomp ] ) as the z bosons from the decay of the spin-2 resonance have longitudinal polarization and , thus , these terms can not contribute .",
    "the @xmath33 state of the resonance does not contribute due to the fact that a gluon is massless .    for longitudinal vbf , the only possible mode for the produced resonance is @xmath33 and the corresponding amplitude behaves as @xmath34 .",
    "inherent to our analysis is the assumption that the spin-2 resonance is produced essentially at rest so that its decay products are mostly back to back .",
    "we assume that the center of mass frame of the resonance can be determined experimentally in the clean pp @xmath3 zz @xmath3 4 charged leptons mode where the decay chain can be fully reconstructed .",
    "the original idea of technicolor @xcite is the postulate of the existence of additional tc gauge interaction similar to qcd with the dynamical scale of the order of the electroweak scale and some new matter fields called technifermions taken to transform according to a suitable representation of the tc gauge group .",
    "one of the explicit tc models we will consider in this paper will be the `` scaled - up '' version of qcd with technifermions in the fundamental representation of the tc gauge group .",
    "in two other models , technifermions will be in the adjoint ( mwt ) and two - index symmetric ( nmwt ) representations of the tc gauge groups su(2 ) and su(3 ) , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in all these models the technifermions are taken to be singlet under qcd and assigned anomaly free @xmath35 hypercharges .",
    "the electroweak gauge group @xmath36 is a part of the new global symmetry group associated with chiral dynamics of the technifermions .",
    "when strong dynamics of tc forces spontaneously breaks these new global symmetries the weak gauge bosons obtain their masses through the higgs mechanism in usual manner while the photon of electromagnetism remains massless .",
    "we begin with the brief review of the formalism for the scattering of the ( techni)pions . at high energies , the scattering of longitudinally polarized vector bosons ( @xmath37 ) can be approximated by the scattering of the would - be - goldstone bosons @xmath38 .",
    "if we think of these goldstone fields in analogy with the pions of qcd , we expect the @xmath39 scattering amplitudes to be unitarized by a spin - one , isospin - one vector resonance , like the techni - rho . as another alternative ,",
    "if we think of the goldstone fields in terms of the linear sigma model , we expect the scattering amplitudes to be unitarized by a spin - zero , isospin - zero scalar field like the higgs boson .",
    "both of these states , together with the spin-2 resonance will be included when we consider unitarity of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "we are interested in the strongly interacting longitudinal @xmath37 bosons in the tev region .",
    "we will ignore the up - down fermion mass splittings and , therefore , the su(2 ) `` isospin '' is conserved .",
    "the @xmath39 scattering amplitudes can then be written in terms of isospin amplitudes with the following assignment of the isospin indices , @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes either @xmath42 or @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the scattering amplitude is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "all the physics of @xmath49 scattering is contained in the amplitude function @xmath50 .",
    "given the amplitude function , the physical amplitudes for boson - boson scattering are given as follows @xcite , @xmath51    we will need only @xmath52 and @xmath53 amplitudes .",
    "contribution of the spin-1 ( technirho ) and spin-0 ( composite higgs ) resonances to the scattering is @xcite :    @xmath54 \\ , \\label{eq : inv_2}\\ ] ]    here @xmath55 gev appropriate for the strong dynamics at the electroweak scale .",
    "scaling up from qcd , note that the mass of the vector resonance should be as large as ( 246 gev/93 mev)@xmath56770 mev @xmath57 2 tev .",
    "however in a theory with walking dynamics the resonances are expected to be lighter than in a running , qcd - like , setup .",
    "similarly the coupling @xmath58 can be estimated by recalling that the qcd value that follows from @xmath59  mev would be @xmath60 .",
    "the contribution of a spin - two meson @xmath61 to the invariant amplitude comes from the effective chiral interaction lagrangian between the traceless symmetric tensor nonet field @xmath62 and the pions @xcite , @xmath63= -\\frac{g_2}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( f_2)_{\\mu\\nu}\\partial^{\\mu } \\vec{\\pi}\\cdot \\partial^{\\nu } \\vec{\\pi}+\\cdots$ ] , and the resulting contribution to the amplitude is @xmath64-\\frac{g_2 ^ 2 s^3}{12 m_{f_2}^4 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the mass of the spin-2 meson and its coupling with the pions , respectively .",
    "again , one can obtain a reference value for @xmath66 by relating to qcd where @xmath67  mev and @xmath68  mev gives @xmath69  gev@xmath70 so that @xmath71 . scaling the dimensionful numbers up to the eletroweak scale results in @xmath72  tev@xmath70 .",
    "it is easy to check that in the @xmath73 limit the @xmath74 $ ] piece @xmath75 in accordance with the angular analysis section [ angular ] .",
    "we note that the tensor interaction @xmath76 above can , on the gravity side , be compared to the gauge - invariant lagrangian for the kk graviton @xmath77 field coupled to the scalar bosons which is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath80 term in eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) , which would not be present in the graviton case , is due to the absence of the @xmath81 term , _",
    "i.e. _ the tracelessness condition for the @xmath62 .    to constrain the parameter space by unitarity of the @xmath82 scattering",
    "we apply the analysis of @xcite which we briefly review here for completeness . for the unitarity analysis the most general amplitude",
    "should be expanded in its isospin @xmath83 and spin @xmath84 components , @xmath85 , but it turns out that the @xmath86 @xmath87 component , @xmath88 \\ , \\ ] ] has the worst high energy behavior , and is therefore taken as a basis for the analysis .",
    "the possible resonances which contribute to the unitarity of @xmath82 scattering here are a light higgs , an axial ( which will be lighter than the vector in two of the three tc theories ) , vector and the tensor .",
    "the axial can only be lighter than the vector in a walking technicolor theory ( wt ) , where the second weinberg sum rule is modified .",
    "moreover , the chances of the axial being lighter than the vector are increased as the conformal window is approached , and the @xmath89 parameter decreases .",
    "also , light composite higgs can naturally emerge in strongly coupled theories with matter in higher dimensional representations such as mwt and nmwt @xcite .",
    "the axial resonance can not directly participate in the tree - level exchanges in the @xmath82 scattering due to parity invariance .",
    "rather , the constraint due to @xmath90 field is indirect and appears in the @xmath82 scattering because the pion eaten by the @xmath91 boson contains a certain amount of the longitudinal component of @xmath90 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath92 coupling are affected by the presence of @xmath90 , but since the dependence on @xmath93 comes together with other new parameters , it turns out that @xmath58 and @xmath92 remain completely free to take on any value . to see the effects of a light axial resonance in the @xmath82 scattering one imposes the wsr s and simultaneously requires that the @xmath89 parameter is small .",
    "since the wsr s are affected by walking dynamics the resulting constraints on the allowed region in the @xmath94 space are different with walking dynamics than in a theory with a qcd - like dynamics and a heavy axial .",
    "the wsr s , appropriately modified to account for the walking dynamics @xcite , read @xmath95 \\ , \\label{eq : wsr0 } \\\\ & & f_v^2-f_a^2=f_\\pi^2 \\label{eq : wsr1 } \\ , \\\\ & & f_v^2 m_v^2 - f_a^2 m_a^2 = a\\frac{8\\pi^2}{d(r)}f_\\pi^4 \\label{eq : wsr2 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 ( @xmath93 ) are decay constant and mass of the vector ( axial ) resonance , @xmath99 is the dimension of the fermion representation of the underlying gauge theory , and @xmath100 is an unknown number . in wt @xmath100",
    "is expected to be positive and of order one while in a qcd - like theory @xmath101 . for the mwt with two flavors in the adjoint representation of su(2 )",
    "we take @xmath102 , and the naive contribution to the @xmath89 parameter is @xmath103 . in the nmwt we have two flavors in the two - index symmetric representation of su(3 ) ,",
    "@xmath104 , and the naive estimate of @xmath89 is @xmath105 . we will also consider the constraints for a running theory , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the wsr s of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wsr0 ] ) - ( [ eq : wsr2 ] ) one demands that vector and axial resonances should not be broad by excluding the regions in the parameter space corresponding to , @xmath106    finally , combining the above constraints with the unitarity constraints gives the allowed regions for the parameters @xmath107,@xmath108,@xmath109 and @xmath110 in the three tc theories we will consider ( see appendix of @xcite where these constraints were translated to the constraints on the values of @xmath108 . in our analysis",
    "we added the tensor mass and coupling as extra parameters while in @xcite only @xmath107,@xmath108 were considered ) .",
    "specific values for the parameters will be given in detail in the section [ numerics ] , where we present our numerical results .    to conclude this section and to prepare for the numerical analysis of the total cross sections , we discuss the relevant production mechanism for spin-2 tc bound state , namely , vbf via @xmath111 or @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the probability for emission of ( an almost ) collinear longitudinal @xmath113 by a quark ( or anti - quark ) is suppressed by electroweak factor of @xmath114 .",
    "however , the coupling of longitudinal @xmath113 to spin-2 tc tensor is enhanced .",
    "moreover , vbf can proceed via valence quarks through the @xmath115 , @xmath116 or @xmath117 scatterings in addition to @xmath118 and @xmath119 annihilation ( which are suppressed due to the smaller sea quark content ) .",
    "hence , the other amplitudes with transverse polarizations for initial or final state bosons can be neglected due to the smaller couplings to the spin-2 tc tensor . as was explained in sec .",
    "[ angular ] , the expected angular dependence of the matrix element is @xmath120 as we will also see to arise from our numerical calculation .",
    "the required parton - level cross - section is given by @xmath121 where the subscript @xmath122 on @xmath123 denotes longitudinal polarization .",
    "the probability distribution for a quark of energy @xmath124 to emit a longitudinally polarized gauge boson of energy @xmath125 and transverse momentum @xmath126 ( relative to quark momentum ) is approximated by @xcite : @xmath127 ^ 2 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{lemission}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an example of @xmath111 fusion from @xmath117 scattering , the proton - level cross - section can then be written as @xmath128 where in the second line , we have used the fact that from eq .",
    "( [ lemission ] ) the average @xmath129 of the longitudinal @xmath123 is given by @xmath130 .",
    "here , @xmath131 tev is roughly the energy of the longitudinal @xmath123 in order to produce an _ on_-shell composite tensor state .",
    "hence , we can neglect transverse momenta in the parton - level cross - section , i.e. , set @xmath132 and integrate over the transverse momenta to obtain total probabilities , @xmath133 .",
    "also , @xmath134 is the parton distribution function ( pdf ) corresponding to @xmath7 , @xmath19 quarks in the proton ; the @xmath7 quark ( or @xmath135 ) can come from the first proton and @xmath19 quark ( or @xmath136 ) from the second proton or vice versa .",
    "expressions for contributions from @xmath137 emission from various other combinations of quarks and anti - quarks inside the protons can be similarly obtained . finally , we mention that the vbf offers the possibility to tag two additional highly energetic forward jets @xcite . in this case",
    "we have to consider the @xmath112 + 2 jets sm background .",
    "additional complication is the fact that in the present configuration of lhc experiments , pseudorapidity range @xmath2 6 - 10 is not covered .",
    "we will not pursue the forward - jets - tagging option here and only require two ( almost ) back - to - back z bosons in the central region with `` central - jet - vetoing '' @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the rs model and present the amplitudes needed for the numerical analysis . the rs framework @xcite features an extra - dimension which is taken to be a slice of ads@xmath138 space . at the endpoints of this five - dimensional space ( @xmath139 ) reside two branes which are usually labeled as an ultraviolet ( uv ) planck brane and an ir ( tev ) brane .",
    "the large hierarchy of scales is resolved by a geometrical exponential factor . due to the warped geometry ,",
    "the relationship between the @xmath140 mass scales ( taken to be of order @xmath141 where @xmath141 is the reduced planck mass in four dimensions ) and those in an effective @xmath142 description depend on the field - localization in the extra dimension .",
    "the zero - mode of the graviton is localized near the uv brane which has a planckian fundamental scale , whereas the higgs sector is localized near the ir brane where the `` red - shifted '' fundamental scale is in the tev - range .",

    "the sm fields are allowed to propagate in the extra dimension @xcite . in this scenario",
    "there are kk excitations of sm gauge and fermion fields in addition to those of the graviton .",
    "these states have masses in the tev range and are localized near the tev brane .",
    "the sm particles are the zero - modes of the 5d fields , and the profile of a sm fermion in the extra dimension depends on its 5d mass . by localizing light fermions near the planck brane and heavier ones near the tev brane ,",
    "the contributions to the fcnc and ewpt are suppressed by factors tev/@xmath149 where @xmath150 . as a consequence ,",
    "the kk graviton whose profile is peaked at the tev brane will couple mostly to the top quark , higgs ( or , by equivalence theorem , to the longitudinal @xmath91 and @xmath151 bosons ) , and kk excitations of the sm fields @xcite .",
    "standard model gluons have a flat profile so that their coupling to kk graviton is suppressed only by a factor of the size of the extra dimension ( in units of radius of curvature ) , i.e. , @xmath152 .",

    "@xmath171 as @xmath172 .    similarly as in the case of technicolor , to reliably compare against the possible experimental signal we need the parton - level signal ( @xmath173 ) cross - section , averaged over initial state spins and colors",

    "note that @xmath178 is the only independent non - zero matrix element for the above process .",
    "the total parton level cross section @xmath179 is related to the proton - level total signal cross - section as usual : @xmath180 where @xmath181 are the gluon pdf s and @xmath182 is the typical momentum transfer in the partonic process for resonant production of a kk graviton .",

    "the total proton - level cross section is obtained as in the rs model case , namely , using eq .",
    "( [ sigtot ] ) .",
    "finally , we will exploit the fact that the sm background is dominated by transversely polarized z bosons .",

    "these numerical values demonstrate the generic problem that lowering the spin-2 tensor mass , rs production dominates more and more over corresponding tc and sm background cases because gluon pdf s are larger in this region as compared to quark ones .",
    "thus , it is very hard to mimic the production for both sides with low spin-2 mass .",
    "thus , if the lhc happens to observe spin-2 state with such a low mass , rs would be the favored explanation out of the possibilities considered here .",
    "one might think that it is possible to lower the rs production by decreasing the value of c@xmath161 parameter .",
    "but then from eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) the graviton width decreases significantly .",
    "then the width of the rs graviton and spin-2 tc bound states are not expected to be the same anymore and therefore this should help to distinguish them in experiment .",
    "we can not lower the spin-2 tc resonance width because for such a big value of the tensor coupling in our numerical analysis the width of the spin-2 tc bound state is expected to get bigger , not smaller , than in the guiding scaled - up - qcd case .",
    "the fact that in our analysis we kept width of the spin-2 tc resonance close to the expected one from qcd but significantly increased the tensor coupling to the pions provides another tension in this problem .",
    "we emphasize that the above dominance of rs vs tc spin two production is characteristic to the rs model described in section [ rs ] .",
    "in particular , the ultraviolet scale in this model was taken to be @xmath215 but other possibilities can be envisioned . among these possibilities , in @xcite volume - truncated version , by a factor y @xmath148 6 , of the rs model was proposed with an ultraviolet cut off scale @xmath216 tev . in this `` little rs ( lrs ) '' model , the graviton cross - section considered in our paper would be lowered by a factor of @xmath217 and thus could agree in magnitue with the corresponding tc case with low spin-2 mass better @xcite .",

    "we assume 100 @xmath222 efficiency for our clean 4-lepton signal . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we want to stress that once we assume that the 1.5 - 2 tev resonance is observed in experiment , it means that the tensor has to dominate in tc case under consideration which in turn implies that due to different production mechanism there will be a difference between rs and tc cases . of course , it is possible that in tc case parameters are different than the ones we considered but then it is not always possible to find resonant behavior because spin-2 is _ the only _ resonance in our treatment which can appear in the s - channel ( except the composite higgs which is expected to be light ) and so the tensor coupling should be large enough ( qcd reference value would be appropriate choice , for example ) .",
    "the problem for such a qcd - like value of the tensor coupling is the dominance of the sm background , which is about twice bigger than the tc signal .",
    "summarizing , we choose the tc parameters based on the a ) requirement of unitarity , b ) saturation of weinberg sum rules and c ) experimental observation of a spin-2 resonance .    also , we would like to point out that in the typical rs model we are considering , the ratio between the graviton coupling to gluons and the graviton coupling to longitudinal gauge bosons is @xmath223 1/35 and , thus , one can not change the relative size of the gluon fusion vs. vbf graviton productions mechanisms .",
    "therefore , the vbf mechanism remains subleading to the gluon fusion even when , similar to tc case , one tries to increase the graviton coupling to `` would - be '' goldstones ( this would , however , be possible by increasing the c@xmath197 value ) .",
    "we analyzed three tc models and showed that it is possible to find parameter space for them which leads to spin-2 production similar to the rs case for the same mass and width of the tensor resonance .",
    "we emphasize that the choices of the parameter values we made for the tc theory are rather uniquely fixed by the requirement of unitarity and the wsr .",
    "the only unnatural value was the tensor coupling constant @xmath66 which was somewhat large compared to the qcd - like theory predictions .",
    "the most natural region of the spin-2 mass where the two models can yield similar results was found to be about 2 tev . for smaller mass ,",
    "rs production is expected to dominate due to high gluon densities and for higher mass the sm background becomes dominant .",
    "we showed that still ( assuming the two models give similar signals ) it is possible to discriminate the models based on angular analysis after we know the mass , width , and s / b values from experiment . knowing these values will suggest the corresponding angular distributions for the two theories .",
    "we note that our analysis can be also used as a prediction for the tc theories only ( without the reference to the rs ) . in this case , perhaps the tensor coupling value should be taken smaller ( close to the qcd value @xmath2244 tev@xmath70 ) .",
    "still , in the resonant region , the tensor will dominate as long as the other parameters are taking values similar to the ones we used in our analysis .",
    "angular distributions for this case will be dictated by the s / b ratio .",
