    "once a physical wavelength becomes larger than @xmath7 , it is causally disconnected from physical processes .",
    "the inflationary era is followed , respectively , by radiation - dominated and matter - dominated epochs during which these fluctuations can re - enter the cosmological horizon  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for a given physical scale @xmath8 , the horizon crossing time @xmath9 ( i.e. the instant when that scale re - enters @xmath7 ) is conventionally defined by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the scale factor .",
    "the collapse that gives rise to the formation of a pbh is now possible but only if the amplitude of the density fluctuation ( @xmath12 ) is larger than a specific threshold value @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the expansion of the overdense region will , eventually , come to a halt , followed by its collapse .",
    "the majority of the pbhs formed at a particular epoch have masses within the order of the horizon mass , @xmath13 , at that epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) given by @xmath14 however , in the case of perturbations with @xmath12 only slightly larger than the critical value , @xmath15 , the pbh masses rather obey the scaling law @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 in the case of a radiation - dominated universe .",
    "this power law scaling has been found to hold down to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the probability that a fluctuation crossing the horizon at some instant @xmath9 has of collapsing and forming a pbh can be written as ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass variance at horizon crossing .",
    "@xcite , based on a simplified model of an overdense collapsing region , found @xmath21 for a radiation - dominated universe .",
    "in more recent years the threshold @xmath0 has been extensively investigated by numerical simulations in pbh formation , in particular by numerically solving relativistic hydrodynamical equations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although @xcite reported the value @xmath22 in the case of a radiation - dominated expanding universe , this was later revised to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "usually @xmath0 is constant throught the radiation - dominated epoch , the exception occurring during cosmological phase transitions , when the value of @xmath0 decreases ( as a consequence of the decrease of the sound speed ) .",
    "this is relevant , since a lower value of @xmath0 favours pbh production ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "the standard model of particle physics ( smpp ) predicts : ( i ) the electroweak ( ew ) phase transition at temperatures of @xmath24 , responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the ew symmetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( ii ) the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transition at @xmath25 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as the expansion of the universe goes on , the temperature decreases and , by the temperature of the qcd transition , with the universe consisting on a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , we have @xmath27 . at the end of the qcd transition , when the universe becomes an hadronic gas ( hg ) , we reach @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the behaviour of @xmath0 during the qcd phase transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after reviewing , in section [ sec : the early universe ] , some key aspects concerning the early universe and the qcd phase transition we derive , in section [ sec : delta_c qcd ] , new results for @xmath0 considering three different models : the bag model ( bm ) , the lattice fit model ( lfm ) , and the crossover model ( cm ) . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we conclude with a general discussion .",
    "we have considered , for the radiation - dominated phase of the universe , the lowest accepted value of @xmath29 , which corresponds to the mexican - hat perturbation profile , a very representative one .",
    "table [ tabela - inicial ] ( section  [ sec : the early universe ] ) sums up key observational and derived parameters that we used throughout this paper .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order for the collapse of an overdense region in the early universe forming a pbh , we must have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the amplitude of the density fluctuation perturbation and @xmath15 a critical value which is related to the particular perturbation profile shape .",
    "we chose to work with @xmath29 since it corresponds to the representative mexican - hat perturbation profile .",
    "although the value of @xmath0 remains constant during the radiation - dominated epoch , it can experience important reductions during cosmological phase transitions , which lead to a higher probability @xmath32 of forming pbhs .    in particular , at the qcd phase transition",
    "@xmath33  m@xmath34 pbhs might be formed @xcite , even if only constituting a small fraction of the dark halo objets , they are not completely ruled out .",
    "a population of even smaller pbhs might also have formed , according to the scaling law given by equation ( [ scaling - law ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we explored the behaviour of @xmath0 during the qcd phase transition under three diferent models : bag model ( bm ) , crossover model ( cm ) , and lattice fit model ( lfm ) and obtained reductions of @xmath35 ( cm ) , @xmath36 ( lfm ) , and @xmath1 ( bm )  cf .",
    "table  [ delta - c - min ] .    assuming , for example , @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "* ) we get , for a radiation - dominated universe ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath38 ( equation [ bringmann_et_al_2001_eq5 ] ) , a negligible value . our new results , however , show that @xmath15 can get as low as 0.097 ( bm ; table  [ delta - c - min ] ) , which implies the much higher probability of @xmath39 , which lies very close to the observational constraints at the qcd epoch ( cf .",
    "although the bm is the one that offers the best prospects as regards pbh formation , even in the case of the cm ( a much smoother event : compare figures [ sobrinho2007_qcd_bagmodel_deltac_t ] and [ sobrinho2007_qcd_crossover_total ] ) an important contribution to pbh formation is still expectable .",
    "assuming , for example , @xmath40 we get @xmath41 .",
    "our next step will be to find an appropriate expression for the mass variance at horizon crossing , so that we might estimate the fraction of the universe going into pbhs during the qcd epoch and , consequently , their cosmological density .",
