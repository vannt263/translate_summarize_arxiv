    "<S> we measure the ac susceptibility of single - crystal cecoin@xmath0 in dc field parallel to the _ c _ axis and find further evidence for a high - field phase transition within the superconducting phase in this orientation . </S>",
    "<S> we apply up to 2.3 kbar uniaxial pressure along the @xmath1 axis and discuss the pressure dependence of the high - field phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the behavior of @xmath2 under uniaxial pressure for field along @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the heavy - fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath0 and its isostructural cousins ce(ir , rh)in@xmath0 and pu(co , rh)ga@xmath0 exhibit several intriguing features . </S>",
    "<S> collectively these compounds have ground states that are superconducting , antiferromagnetic , or both . </S>",
    "<S> the materials have significant two - dimensional character , suggested by their layered crystal structure and confirmed through electronic structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , within each family @xmath3 varies linearly with the ratio of lattice constants @xmath4 , illustrating how closely geometry and superconductivity can be linked @xcite . with a @xmath1-axis magnetic field cecoin@xmath0 also has a quantum critical point near the upper critical field , which can be shifted into the superconducting phase with hydrostatic pressure @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> yet another unusual feature appears in the high - field , low - temperature portion of the superconducting regime . </S>",
    "<S> this has been studied mainly for magnetic fields applied in the basal plane , where @xmath2 is about 11.8 tesla and a signature within the superconducting phase is seen near 10 tesla with magnetization @xcite , specific heat @xcite , neutron diffraction @xcite , and nmr @xcite measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the additional signature moves to higher fields as temperature increases , intersecting the @xmath5 curve near 300 mk . </S>",
    "<S> these data are of particular interest since cecoin@xmath0 is a good candidate to support the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) superconducting phase described almost 50 years ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this state is marked by a non - zero quasiparticle center - of - mass momentum and a spatially periodic superconducting order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> cecoin@xmath0 is in the extremely clean limit and has strong pauli limiting of its critical field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the high - field phase ( hfp ) is accompanied by a change of the normal - superconducting transition from second - order at low fields to first - order at high fields , in agreement with fflo theory @xcite . while the exact nature of the phase and its identification with fflo remain in question @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental evidence for the hfp with in - plane field is clear .    </S>",
    "<S> much less effort has been devoted to cecoin@xmath0 with magnetic field along the @xmath1 axis . </S>",
    "<S> a few measurements have indicated a high - field phase for this orientation too , as seen both by signatures within the superconducting phase @xcite and by a change of the normal - superconducting transition from second - order to first - order similar to that observed for in - plane field . </S>",
    "<S> however , other experiments have found no signatures @xcite , leaving even the experimental situation unclear . in this report </S>",
    "<S> we provide further evidence for the hfp phase in cecoin@xmath0 for @xmath6 , along with the uniaxial pressure dependence of the hfp boundary up to 2.32 kbar .    </S>",
    "<S> we measured three samples oriented with uniaxial pressure , dc field , and ac field parallel to the _ c _ axis . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure is applied with a bellows setup activated with helium gas from room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the samples had mass of 3.67 mg , 0.67 mg and 0.92 mg with area 2.78 @xmath7 m@xmath8 , 5.16@xmath9 m@xmath8 , and 6.97 @xmath10 m@xmath8 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental details , including sample preparation and orientation , are identical to those we reported previously @xcite , with the exception of the additional dc field used in this study .    for four runs in the pressure cell at nominally zero pressure and zero field , we found an average @xmath11 k. in each case the transition temperature measured in the pressure cell was within 24 mk of the value outside the pressure cell . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> the temperature shift can indicate the initial pressure applied during the experimental setup and cooling process , typically about 0.3 kbar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath3 in cecoin@xmath0 is not very sensitive to @xmath1-axis pressure , shifting by less than 17 mk / kbar @xcite , so it gives little information on the pressure offset . </S>",
    "<S> hence the values for applied pressure used in this paper do not include any offset for an initial pressure .    figure [ onset ] </S>",
    "<S> presents susceptibility curves near the onset of superconductivity for several applied fields , all at a pressure of 1.82 kbar . as indicated by the black lines in the figure </S>",
    "<S> , we determine @xmath3 by assuming the susceptibility is constant in the normal state and changes linearly just below @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> as usual for superconductors , the onset @xmath3 shifts to lower temperature as the applied field increases . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the transition decreases in magnitude and broadens in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude change is due to flux lines threading the sample , which lead to incomplete diamagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening is governed by the temperature - dependence of the vortex pinning . </S>",
    "<S> as temperature falls and the vortices are more strongly pinned , the behavior becomes increasingly diamagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to temperature sweeps below 400 mk and at fields above 4.5 tesla . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility has not saturated but retains a temperature - dependence which decreases with increasing field .    </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed that changing the pressure causes no systematic shift in either @xmath12 or @xmath13 . nor does field shift @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> together these indicate that only @xmath12 is affected and only by tuning applied field . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a decrease in superconducting transition magnitude with increasing field .    </S>",
    "<S> susceptibility at much lower temperatures appears in figure [ scfits ] . </S>",
    "<S> the data shown were measured at 1.42 kbar uniaxial pressure . </S>",
    "<S> when we increase the dc field the superconducting susceptibility @xmath12 decreases in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we track this shift as a function of field by picking out @xmath14 at a fixed temperature from each of these dat sets . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ kink ] shows some of the resulting @xmath14 vs @xmath15 curves . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat this procedure for each of the four temperatures indicated by the dashed lines of figure [ scfits ] . in each case </S>",
    "<S> we smooth the data by averaging @xmath14 in a 40 mk range centered at the desired temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the upper frame of figure [ kink ] shows data at 300 mk for several different pressures . </S>",
    "<S> each data set appears to have linear regimes , but also a kink where the slope changes abruptly . at each pressure </S>",
    "<S> we fit a function of exactly this form : two linear portions , with a kink at ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) where the slope changes . </S>",
    "<S> we use four free parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the slope on each side . </S>",
    "<S> we vary @xmath16 and @xmath17 manually , in steps of 0.01 tesla and 0.00075 , respectively . for each kink location </S>",
    "<S> , we solve for the slopes which best fit the data above and below @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we then select the kink location which minimizes the least squares error . </S>",
    "<S> the lines overlaid in the center plot are the result of this minimization . </S>",
    "<S> the lower plot indicates the location of @xmath16 and also the critical field @xmath2 at 300 mk for each pressure . the two decrease in concert with increasing pressure , showing that most of the kink s shift with pressure comes from the reduction of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the main portion of figure [ phase ] shows @xmath5 at ambient pressure , with @xmath16 also plotted . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in the lower part of figure [ kink ] , @xmath1-axis pressure reduces @xmath2 at low temperatures . at 500 mk , </S>",
    "<S> the change in @xmath18 is 0.04 t / kbar . </S>",
    "<S> hydrostatic pressure has a somewhat larger effect , between 0.06 and 0.08 t / kbar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , although increasing hydrostatic pressure also pushes the high - temperature , low - field portion of the @xmath5 dome up to higher @xmath3 , this shift is almost absent with uniaxial pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we recently reported that the zero - field @xmath3 has little dependence on @xmath1-axis pressure , rising only about 20 mk to a maximum near 2 kbar , so it is not surprising that @xmath1-axis pressure also has little effect on the phase boundary at very low fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the inset of figure [ phase ] expands the high - field , low - temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve is @xmath19 , normalized to 1 at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized @xmath2 curves at other pressures are nearly identical and are omitted from the graph . </S>",
    "<S> the symbols show the normalized kink field , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the kink agrees well with the proposed hfp boundary , which appears between 0.955 and 0.96 in other measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several transitions of the vortex lattice have also been observed @xcite , but the highest of these is near 0.85 , much lower than the kink . under uniaxial pressure both @xmath2 and @xmath16 decrease , by roughly the same factor . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is also approximately independent of temperature and forms a linear boundary well below @xmath2 .    to complement the temperature sweeps described above </S>",
    "<S> we also performed field sweeps at fixed temperature and pressure . </S>",
    "<S> one might expect a kink as in figure [ kink ] to appear directly in this measurement . </S>",
    "<S> however , in fact we find no evidence of a kink . at all fields below @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the slope of @xmath14 vs @xmath15 in the field sweeps is comparable to its high - field value in the temperature - sweep data . </S>",
    "<S> the low - field slope in the temperature sweeps is notably larger . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity to the measurement history could explain why some of the previous experiments have found no sign of a transition to the hfp for @xmath1-axis field .    </S>",
    "<S> one possible source of the kink is influence from the afm qcp , which at ambient pressure occurs at a field very close to @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , under hydrostatic pressure the qcp field decreases about five times as fast as @xmath2 , so that the qcp moves deep inside the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> while its behavior has not been tracked under uniaxial pressure , there is no reason to believe that @xmath2 and @xmath22 would remain close together . since we find that @xmath16 changes with uniaxial pressure only about 1.5 times as fast as @xmath2 , the kink is probably not an indication of the qcp .    </S>",
    "<S> another interpretation is in terms of thermally activated flux flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our temperature sweeps are nearly field - cooled measurements . </S>",
    "<S> although in practice we often do not exceed @xmath3 , we find no apparent difference in the low - temperature susceptibility between these temperature sweeps and those when the sample does begin in the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> the larger low - temperature slope for temperature sweeps indicates that the vortex pinning is stronger after field - cooling . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible explanation is that at higher temperatures the vortices fluctuate enough to find the most favorable pin sites , which they can not do when the field changes at low temperature . in the hfp </S>",
    "<S> , there is no such annealing effect , and the pinning strength always has the smaller value .    a change in pinning strength could arise from antiferromagnetic order in the region above @xmath16 , which could interact with the superconductivity . more generally , any change in the order parameter can reasonably be expected to affect the vortex pinning . </S>",
    "<S> several reports have been made along with theoretical descriptions suggesting this phase is the fflo phase ( see reference @xcite for an overview ) . in the fflo state </S>",
    "<S> periodic planar nodes appear perpendicular to the flux lines , leading to a segmentation of the vortices into pieces of length @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the quasiparticle wave vector @xcite which factors into the order parameter @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the pieces are relatively free of each other and hence better able than conventional vortices to position themselves at pin centers . hence pinning vorces on the flux lines </S>",
    "<S> should increase in the fflo phase . </S>",
    "<S> if the nodal planes reflect the crystal structure , then uniaxial pressure parallel to the flux lines would compress the segmentation length @xmath26 and change the periodicity of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> already strongly pauli - limited , cecoin@xmath0 under uniaxial pressure becomes even more so than with hydrostatic pressure , possibly due to increased hybridization between the ce - in layers . </S>",
    "<S> the way that @xmath16 tracks @xmath2 suggests a possible connection with the electron spin population . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical models suggest redistribution of spin states in the vortex cores upon entering the fflo state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , at the intersection of the nodal plane and the vortex core , excess spin states are emptied .    </S>",
    "<S> ultrasound measurements of the hfp boundary @xcite for in - plane field can also be interpreted in terms of vortex pinning . </S>",
    "<S> the vortices affect the ultrasound velocity more strongly in the hfp , which is consistent with increased pinning ; one explanation is segmentation of the vortices into short , somewhat independent pieces that can better take advantage of low - density pin sites . </S>",
    "<S> such segmentation could arise from the planar order parameter nodes of an fflo state . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , our work suggests _ lower _ pinning in the hfp . </S>",
    "<S> this may be evidence that the hfp phases for the two field orientations are not the same . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that the two measurements are not necessarily contradictory . </S>",
    "<S> the ultrasound signal comes from the most strongly pinned vortices , while our measurements probe the vortices that are most free to move . in principle </S>",
    "<S> the hfp could support a wider range of pinning strengths that produces both effects .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have measured ac susceptibility response of cecoin@xmath0 in an applied field , as well as under uniaxial pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for a phase boundary in agreement with previous indications of the transition to the hfp at zero pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we report a shift in this boundary with uniaxial pressure which roughly tracks @xmath2 , decreasing in field at a rate about 50% faster than the decrease of @xmath2 . for @xmath2 itself </S>",
    "<S> , pressure depresses the critical field at low temperatures but has little effect near @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this differs from hydrostatic measurements but is consistent with the minimal effect of uniaxial pressure on @xmath3 itself . </S>",
    "<S> the location and pressure dependence of the @xmath16 boundary provide further evidence for the hfp phase for @xmath6 in cecoin@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> an unanswered question is why the @xmath16 boundary shows up with temperature sweeps and not field sweeps . </S>"
