    "spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy is essential for mapping the distribution of mass , intracluster plasma , and heavy elements in galaxy clusters .",
    "although chandra and xmm - newton have provided a wealth of information on these quantities in the central regions of clusters , relatively little is known about their outer regions , at radii greater than @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the radius within which the mean cluster density is 200 times the critical cosmic density . in the simplest case of the collapse of a spherical density perturbation in an einstein - desitter universe",
    ", it is expected that the dark and bayronic matter within @xmath16 will have reached dynamical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "cluster emission from the vicinity of @xmath16 is difficult to observe efficiently with chandra and xmm - newton because of their relatively high ( and , in the latter case , time - variable ) levels of instrumental background .",
    "the study of cluster outskirts is important for several reasons .",
    "first , a direct x - ray measurement of total cluster mass ( e.g. , within @xmath16 ) requires knowledge of the icm temperature profile at this radius .",
    "this is especially important to facilitate comparison between x - ray and weak - lensing mass profiles , as the latter are difficult to measure in the inner regions of clusters .",
    "second , structure and cluster formation models make definite predictions about total mass and icm distributions to these radii @xcite , so measurements in this radial range offer a test of these models .",
    "finally , to the extent that @xmath16 marks the approximate boundary of the dynamically relaxed region of a cluster , one might expect to find inhomogeneities in the icm that could provide a direct view of the accretion processes by which clusters grow .",
    "rosat has been used to characterize the x - ray surface brightness of the outer regions ( @xmath17 ) of individual clusters  @xcite and , using stacking techniques , of ensembles of objects  @xcite .",
    "chandra surface brightness profiles in the range @xmath18 for a sample of relatively distant clusters have been studied by  @xcite .",
    "recent suzaku observations have successfully probed out to and beyond @xmath16 for a handful of clusters @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present suzaku measurements of the surface brightness and temperature of the intracluster medium of the x - ray luminous ( @xmath19 erg s@xmath5 ) cluster abell 1795 .",
    "this is a relatively hot ( spatially - averaged @xmath20 kev ) cluster with a cool core @xcite .",
    "although chandra shows a 40-arcsec - long ( @xmath21 kpc ) plume `` trailing '' the brightest cluster galaxy  @xcite , outside of the very center the cluster is quite regular and appears relaxed . from the observed temperature , and scaling relations derived from simulations  @xcite we estimate @xmath22 mpc , consistent with the chandra measurements of  @xcite , and @xmath23 mpc ( @xmath24 ) for our assumed cosmologycdm cosmology with @xmath25 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "one arc minute corresponds to 73 kpc at the cluster redshift ( @xmath28 ) in this cosmology .",
    "unless otherwise noted , quoted errors correspond to 90% confidence intervals . ] .",
    "we exploit the relatively low and stable suzaku background to trace the temperature and icm density to the vicinity of @xmath16 .    as noted by @xcite , if the virial radius @xmath29 is derived from the collapse of a spherical top - hat density perturbation , assuming that the cluster has just virialized , then for an einstein - desitter cosmology @xmath30 , independent of redshift . in general , however , @xmath31 is function of cosmology and redshift , and for our @xmath32cdm cosmology at the redshift of abell 1795 @xmath33 , so the virial radius is considerably larger than @xmath16 . for abell 1795",

    "abell 1795 was observed on 2005 dec 10 , during the suzaku performance verification phase , with a series of 5 overlapping pointings , illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the results reported here were obtained with xis  @xcite data from version 2.0.6.13 of the suzaku data processing pipeline .",
    "data obtained with 3x3 and 5x5 editing modes for each pointing were merged and standard filters ( requiring earth elevation greater than 5 degrees , sunlit earth elevation angle greater than 20 degrees , cutoff rigidity greater than 6 gev / c , and excluding data obtained during and just after passages through the south atlantic anomaly ) were applied .",
    "events in detector regions nominally illuminated by the xis calibration sources were also excluded .",

    "these spectral weights were chosen under the null hypothesis that surface brightness fluctuations in the cluster outskirts are due to cosmic background variations . when applied to cluster emission , they will result in an overestimate of the cluster surface brightness , however we estimate this to be less than 10% ( 5% ) in the 0.52 kev ( 28 kev ) range for the cluster temperatures and abundances measured in this work .",
    "errors in surface brightness between cluster regions of different temperatures ( ranging from 26 kev ) will be less than 2% due to the spectral weighting .",

    "a more plausible explanation may lie in the known discrepancy between chandra and xmm - newton temperatures for relatively hot ( @xmath225 kev ) clusters .",

    "we also note that the azimuthal range covered by the chandra observations  @xcite differs from that we observed with suzaku at these large radii . in principle , therefore , the discrepancy between chandra and suzaku results at this large radius could reflect azimuthal temperature variations in the cluster .",
    "in any event , we are principally concerned here with the cluster temperature profile at @xmath231 .",
    "given the good agreement between the suzaku and xmm - newton temperature profiles in this radial range , we base our subsequent analysis on the suzaku temperatures shown in figure  [ figtp ] .    fitting a power law ( assuming @xmath232 ) to the projected temperature at @xmath191 yields consistent slopes in the north and the south , and @xmath233 for a joint fit to all the data in this radial range .",

    "if the icm is not in hydrostatic equilibrium at this radius , one might expect azimuthal variations in icm density and temperature .",
    "for example , as we noted earlier in section  [ sec : sb ] , the simulations of  @xcite produce ( unfiltered ) clusters with distinct cool clumps at @xmath272 .",

    "adopting the mean of the north and south profiles for the deprojected temperature and density ( see table  [ dptab ] ) , together with the mean of the north and south temperatures measured in the final radial bin of each deprojected profile , we use equation  [ eqn1 ] to estimate the cluster mass . we obtain @xmath285 within @xmath286 mpc , the value of @xmath287 reported by @xcite .",

    "formally , these exceed our mass estimate by @xmath12 and @xmath291 , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy is almost entirely due to the difference in temperature estimated at these radii .",

    "finally , given that @xmath301 in our assumed cosmology  @xcite , our mass profile implies @xmath302 mpc .",
    "the rapidly falling temperature profile we observe implies a rapidly falling mass density profile and a slowly rising integrated mass profile ( see equation  [ eqn1 ] ) . a power - law approximation to our best - fit integrated mass profile in the region",

    "this is much flatter , for example , than the slope expected from an nfw model with scale radius @xmath305 mpc reported by @xcite .",
    "we have presented results of suzaku observations of two distinct regions in the outskirts of abell 1795 .",
    "we detect x - ray emission to @xmath306 mpc in both regions , and in the north trace the hot icm to @xmath169 mpc @xmath307 .",
    "we find that the x - ray surface brightness at @xmath2 mpc is significantly higher in the north than in the south .",
    "we measure the run of temperature with radius at @xmath308 and find that it falls relatively rapidly ( @xmath309 ) and reaches a value about one - third of its peak at the cluster outskirts .",
    "one possible interpretation of our observations is that the icm is not in hydrostatic equilibrium in the radial range @xmath18 , and that in the north we are seeing infalling plasma at relatively low ( @xmath310 kev ) temperature . in support of this picture",
    "we note that the x - ray surface brightness is neither azimuthally symmetric nor ( in the north ) falling monotonically with increasing radius .",
    "moreover , the rapidly falling deprojected temperature profile would require that there is relatively little gravitating mass at @xmath1 mpc if the icm is polytropic and in hydrostatic equilibrium , a result that conflicts with extrapolations of the best - fit nfw profiles derived from high - resolution chandra observations  @xcite .",
    "simulations  @xcite predict , and recent lensing and x - ray observations  @xcite provide evidence for , modest deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in the icm at @xmath311 .",
    "our observations of abell 1795 suggest that in some cases these deviations may be quite significant even in a cluster which appears to be relaxed at smaller radii .",
    "additional observations of a variety of clusters , with more complete azimuthal coverage than we have obtained , will improve understanding of the state of the icm in cluster outskirts , and therefore of cluster masses , structure and formation mechanisms .",
    "finally , we note that these and other observations of the low - surface - brightness outskirts of clusters have been made possible by suzaku s relatively low and stable non - x - ray background .",
    "the surface brightness sensitivity of our observations , @xmath312 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 deg@xmath7 ( @xmath3 ) , is less than 20% of the total cosmic background in this spectral band .",
    "our sensitivity was ultimately limited by time - variable solar wind charge exchange emission and by poisson variations in the extragalactic source density .",
    "we demonstrated here that variations in the geocoronal contribution can be modeled to this level from simultaneous observations of cluster - free background regions . to reduce background source density variations below this level in the relatively small cluster regions ( 0.010.03 deg@xmath142 ) we required information from the xmm - newton source catalog .",
    "future suzaku observations of cluster outskirts would benefit from coverage of larger ( @xmath313 deg@xmath142 ) solid angle in each radial bin , especially if deep x - ray source catalogs are not available .",
