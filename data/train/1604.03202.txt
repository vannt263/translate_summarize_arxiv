    "the tensor force is an important ingredient of the interaction among nucleons .",
    "this force is naturally derived in the meson exchange picture for the nucleonic interaction , and its presence is verified by the non - vanishing quadrupole moment of the deuteron . however , although some of its effects may be incorporated in the effective interaction , explicit inclusion of the tensor force had been avoided in the self - consistent nuclear structure calculations . only relatively recently",
    "the tensor force has been recognized to play a significant role in the @xmath12- or @xmath13-dependence of the shell structure  @xcite .",
    "the tensor force may be responsible for the appearance and disappearance of magic numbers  @xcite , which have been revealed in experiments utilizing the radioactive beams  @xcite .    while the effects of the tensor force on the nuclear mean field ( mf ) have been argued for spherical nuclei in a number of recent studies , investigations of its effect on nuclear deformation",
    "have remained limited .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite applied the skyrme energy density functional ( edf ) that contains the terms connected to the tensor force to the quadrupole deformation , and analyzed the influence of these terms in detail .",
    "although this treatment had already clarified some important aspects of the tensor force related to the nuclear deformation , the real effects of the tensor force remain elusive , primarily because the relevant edf terms are fully parameterized , with signs and strengths not well determined .",
    "it should be noted that the skyrme edf is constrained to the quasi - local form , and the relevant terms in it are not well distinguished from the contribution of the central force .",
    "one of the authors ( h.n . ) has developed semi - realistic nucleonic interactions  @xcite , which are based on the @xmath14-matrix approach  @xcite but are modified from the phenomenological viewpoints .",
    "it has been found that the magic numbers are well described by the m3y - p6 interaction throughout a wide range of the nuclear chart including unstable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "owing to the realistic tensor force in it , the semi - realistic interaction will be useful for investigating the tensor - force effects on nuclear deformation .",
    "conventional mf calculations , not featuring tensor force , have been successful in describing many significant aspects of quadrupole deformation at and around the @xmath15 stability  @xcite .",
    "however , unable to satisfactorily reproduce the @xmath12- and @xmath13-dependence of the shell structure , the reliability of these calculations for nuclei far off the @xmath15-stability , _ e.g. _ those in the so - called island of inversion  @xcite , might be questioned . in practice ,",
    "it has not been easy to capture deformation for @xmath1ne and @xmath2 mg  @xcite , although correlations beyond the mf framework may contribute  @xcite and interpretation other than deformation has not fully been excluded  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we apply the semi - realistic m3y - p6 interaction to the hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations assuming the axial symmetry , for the nuclei located near the shore ( _ i.e. _ the borderline ) of the island of inversion ; three @xmath0 isotones ( @xmath1ne , @xmath2 mg and @xmath3si ) and three @xmath4 isotones ( @xmath5 mg , @xmath6si and @xmath7s ) .",
    "this is the first application of the m3y - type semi - realistic interaction to deformed nuclei .",
    "we then investigate the tensor - force effects on quadrupole deformation in these nuclei .",
    "although we leave to future work inclusion of the pair and rotational correlations via the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) calculations and the angular - momentum projection ( amp ) , we note that these correlations are basically irrelevant to the tensor force .",
    "being free of complications which may be brought in by these correlations , our hf calculations are useful for studying the tensor - force effects on nuclear deformation .",
    "we have implemented self - consistent hf calculations with the non - relativistic effective hamiltonian @xmath16 , which is rotationally and translationally symmetric except the density - dependence .",
    "the nuclear part @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the indices of individual nucleons , is taken to be isoscalar .",
    "the term @xmath21 represents the coulomb interaction between protons .",
    "consistent with @xmath22 , the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "part is @xmath23 , with the total momentum @xmath24 and the mass number @xmath25 .",
    "the effective nucleonic interaction is @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two - nucleon interaction in the central , ls and tensor channels , all of which have the finite - range yukawa form in the m3y - type interactions .",
    "@xmath30 is the density - dependent central force , which is significant to give appropriate saturation properties  @xcite .",
    "we mainly use the m3y - p6 parameter - set  @xcite in this work . although a density - dependent ls channel was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , we here use @xmath31 which is density - independent . in the m3y - p@xmath32 interactions with @xmath33  @xcite",
    ", @xmath29 is kept unchanged from the m3y - paris interaction  @xcite that was obtained from the @xmath14-matrix .",
    "a detailed description of m3y - p6 is provided in ref .",
    "note that both the one- and two - body terms in @xmath34 are subtracted before iteration , and the coulomb exchange term is handled precisely .    in numerical calculations ,",
    "we have employed the gaussian expansion method  @xcite , which has been extended to the axially deformed mf calculations in ref .",
    "single - particle ( s.p . ) functions under axially deformed one - body fields are expressed by superposition of spherical gaussian basis - functions .",
    "whereas the spherical bases are impractical for describing very large deformations such as the superdeformation , they are suitable for arguing structure of deformed nuclei in terms of spherical orbits .",
    "numerical errors owing to the truncation with respect to @xmath35 ( orbital angular momentum ) are estimated as @xmath36  @xcite for normally deformed states studied here .    to obtain the deformed energy minima ,",
    "axially deformed configurations should be given as initial conditions .",
    "in the present calculations , we have set initial configurations by the deformed woods - saxon ( ws ) potential , assuming a certain value for the deformation parameter @xmath15 , and then have solved the hf equation iteratively until ensuring convergence .",
    "several minima have been searched for each nucleus by varying @xmath15 of the initial ws potential , from @xmath37 to @xmath38 in steps of @xmath39 .",
    "notice that the minimum of the total energy does not necessarily imply that the s.p .",
    "levels should be filled in the order of s.p .",
    "energies . when inverted or closely located s.p",
    ". levels are present around the fermi energy , we have conducted additional calculations by purposely filling the other configuration , and have compared the total energies .",
    "moreover , we have implemented the constrained hf ( chf ) calculations by adding the quadratic constraining term to the hamiltonian as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the mass quadrupole moment operator defined by @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 has been fixed to @xmath44 in all chf calculations in the present work .",
    "starting from each energy minimum of @xmath45 , we have gradually varied the value of @xmath46 .",
    "the variational calculations with respect to @xmath47 have been implemented for fixed @xmath43 and @xmath46 , by which a slater determinant @xmath48 has been determined .",
    "the gradient method has been used in these chf calculations , starting from the solution at adjacent @xmath46 .",
    "energy curves @xmath49 are plotted ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath50 as a function of the mass quadrupole moment @xmath51 ) , for @xmath52 that minimizes @xmath47 .",

    "influence of the c.m .",
    "motion on the quadrupole moment is removed in @xmath51 , while it is ignored in @xmath56 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we have also computed the expectation value @xmath57 , and plot @xmath58 to reveal tensor - force effects .",
    "one might think that the tensor - force effects are obtained via the minimization of @xmath59 , rather than the expectation value with @xmath60 that minimizes @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 ) . however ,",
    "since several parameters in m3y - p6 have been adjusted under the presence of @xmath29 , it is not clear what the state stands for that is obtained from the minimization of @xmath59 . in most of the present cases ,",
    "the effects of @xmath29 are perturbative and the minimization of @xmath59 almost coincides with @xmath58 , as will be shown later .",
    "the axial chf calculations have been also performed by adopting the gogny - d1 m interaction  @xcite for @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_n ] ) , which is one of the most successful effective interactions without including the tensor force .",
    "although other channels may also contribute , a comparison with the d1 m results suggests difference between interactions fitted with and without the tensor force .",
    "in this section we present @xmath49 for the @xmath0 and @xmath8 nuclei and discuss loss or persistence of the @xmath0 and @xmath8 magic numbers in them .",
    "it should be commented , however , that the definition of ` magicity ' is not necessarily obvious .",
    "theoretically , magicity is related to a large shell gap and resultant strong quenching of many - body correlations .",
    "therefore one of the reasonable theoretical definitions is given by the stability of the spherical hf configuration with respect to these correlations .",
    "although it is not easy to compare the shell gap and the correlations quantitatively , pairing was used as a measure of the correlations in ref .",
    "@xcite , by performing the spherical hfb calculations .",
    "the quadrupole deformation is another important correlation that may violate magicity . by implementing the axial hf calculations , persistence and loss of the @xmath0 and @xmath8 magicities against the quadrupole deformation",
    "are investigated , and the role of the tensor force in determining them is discussed . the neutron configuration in the ground state is @xmath64 [ @xmath65 if the @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) magicity is maintained .",
    "this configuration favors a spherical shape .",
    "as a deviation from this configuration leads to a certain deformation within the hf framework , the extent of the deformation is expected to be a measure of the magicity .      before proceeding to discuss the nuclei around the island of inversion , we show , in table  [ tab : min - n20a ] , @xmath51 and @xmath66 for the lowest and second lowest energy minima of the @xmath15-stable @xmath0 nuclei @xmath67s , @xmath68ar and @xmath5ca . the deformation parameter @xmath15 is also presented , which is extracted from @xmath51 via the following relation  @xcite , @xmath69 another deformation parameter @xmath70 is sometimes used  @xcite .",

    "there are two minima with very small deformation .",

    "as has been pointed out earlier , the tensor force contributes repulsively to the total energy .",
    "this is accounted for as follows .",
    "occupation of a proton @xmath95 orbit heightens the energies of neutron @xmath95 orbits while it lowers the energies of @xmath96 orbits .",
    "if pairs of neutron @xmath11 partners ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath149 orbits ) are fully populated , the contribution of the tensor force becomes negligibly small .",
    "however , owing to the @xmath11 splitting , the occupation probability of a valence @xmath95 orbit is necessarily higher than that of its @xmath11 partner",
    ". therefore the net effect of the tensor force is repulsive unless negligible .",
    "deformation is enhanced if the repulsive effect of the tensor force is weak in the deformed state compared with the spherical state , and _",
    "vice versa_. in all nuclei under discussion , protons occupy @xmath150 with a significantly higher probability than that of @xmath73 . in the @xmath4 nuclei ,",
    "the repulsive effect of the tensor force is maximal in the spherical state where @xmath10 is fully occupied .",
    "if the system is deformed , it tends toward the spin saturation , which suppresses the tensor - force effects .",
    "thus the tensor force facilitates the quadrupole deformation in the @xmath4 nuclei .",
    "it is commented that the tensor - force effects on the deformation in the @xmath4 nuclei have been argued within the shell model in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the @xmath0 nuclei",
    "the tensor - force effects are small in the spherical state , because the spin degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) for neutrons are saturated .",
    "once the system is deformed , the spin saturation is somewhat broken , and the tensor - force effects become sizable . this mechanism works stronger after level crossing . because protons partially occupy @xmath150 in this region , the neutron @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) level shifts up ( down ) owing to the tensor force .",
    "if level crossing occurs , the neutrons occupying @xmath73 are moved to a level dominated by @xmath135 .",
    "this causes energy loss of the deformed state . as a result",
    "the tensor force tends to suppress the deformation in the @xmath0 nuclei , opposite to what happens in the @xmath4 case .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ne30_e - q0][fig : s44_e - q0 ] , some of the tensor - force effects in the m3y - p6 results are reproduced in the d1 m results in an effective manner .",
    "this is also consistent with the results for the @xmath4 isotones based on the relativistic edf with the dd - pc1 parameter - set  @xcite , which does not contain the tensor force .",
    "this indicates that certain aspects of the tensor - force effects can be compensated by other channels .",
    "however , the tensor - force effects yield the @xmath12-dependence of the s.p . levels , which are not well converted to the other channels  @xcite . in the energy curves in figs .  [ fig : ne30_e - q0][fig : s44_e - q0 ] , we observe a visible difference between the m3y - p6 and d1 m results ( apart from constant shifts ) for the minimum at @xmath99 in @xmath6si and the minimum at @xmath130 in @xmath7s .",
    "in addition , we have found that m3y - p6 favors deformation more than d1 m in @xmath1ne .",
    "we have implemented axial hartree - fock ( including constrained hartree - fock ) calculations with the semi - realistic interaction m3y - p6 , which contains a realistic tensor force .",
    "this is the first application of the m3y - type semi - realistic interaction to deformed nuclei .",
    "effects of the tensor force on deformation have been investigated for the neutron - rich @xmath0 and @xmath8 nuclei , @xmath1ne , @xmath2 mg , @xmath3si , @xmath5 mg , @xmath6si and @xmath7s . with few exceptions",
    ", the tensor force does not significantly affect the intrinsic quadrupole moments that give the energy minima , indicating that its main effect is to create a configuration - dependent energy shift .",
    "it is reasonable to consider the tensor - force effects in terms of the occupancy of spherical orbits .    in the @xmath4 nuclei ,",
    "the tensor force favors deformation , as accounted for by the full occupation of @xmath95 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath10 ) for @xmath4  @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the tensor force tends to favor sphericity in the @xmath0 nuclei , because of the @xmath11-closure of the @xmath0 magic number . in particular , crossing between a @xmath96 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath89 ) level and a @xmath95 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath10 ) level in a deformed configuration leads to an energy loss . while most of these tensor - force effects seem to be absorbed into the other interaction channels , as concluded by comparing the m3y - p6 results to the d1 m results , a notable difference remains for several configurations .",
    "although inclusion of the pair and rotational correlations should be awaited , the present results obtained with m3y - p6 do not contradict experimental findings .",
    "the shape change in the @xmath4 isotones seems consistent with experiments . for the @xmath0 nuclei ,",
    "the deformed ground state of @xmath1ne and the spherical ground state of @xmath3si match the existing data quite well .",
    "whereas the lowest minimum in @xmath2 mg is nearly spherical in the present calculation , we have obtained another minimum with a close energy , which suggests shape coexistence . in a previous study",
    ", magic numbers were well predicted in a wide range of the nuclear chart by the spherical hfb calculations using the m3y - p6 interaction . as an exception ,",
    "@xmath0 was not broken in @xmath2 mg .",
    "the present result hints that , in the approaches based on semi - realistic interactions , this problem might be alleviated within the mf regime if the deformation is properly taken into account , not invoking beyond - mf effects as in some other studies .",
    "the authors are grateful to t. inakura for discussions .",
    "this work is financially supported in part by the jsps kakenhi grant number  24105008 and grant number  16k05342 .",
