    "there has recently been some ongoing intense interest in the thermodynamic product formula both in the general relativity community @xcite and in the string / m - theory community @xcite to understand the black hole(bh ) entropy @xcite of multi - horizons at the microscopic level .",
    "significant achievements have been made in case of asymptotically flat super - symmetric bhs in four and five dimension , where the microscopic degrees of freedom could be explained in terms of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) conformal field theory ( cft)@xcite . for microscopic entropy of extreme rotating bh , the results could be found in @xcite .    in case of a regular axi - symmetric and stationary space - time of einstein - maxwell gravity with surrounding matter , the entropy product formula of event horizon ( @xmath0 ) and cauchy horizon ( @xmath1 ) is@xcite @xmath2 in the absence of maxwell gravity",
    ", the product formula reduces to the following form @xmath3 the interesting point in the above formula is that they all are independent of the adm ( arnowitt - deser - misner ) mass parameter .    after incorporating the bps ( bogomolni - prasad - sommerfeld ) states the entropy product formula of @xmath4 should read @xmath5 where the integers @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the excitation numbers of the left and right moving modes of a weakly - coupled 2d cft",
    ". the integers also depend upon exactly all of the bh parameters .",
    "[ ss ] indicates that the product of @xmath4 could be expressed in terms of the underlying cft which can be interpreted in terms of a level matching condition .",
    "that means the entropy product of @xmath8 is an integer quantity @xcite and it also implies that it is quantized in nature .",
    "however in this _ letter _",
    ", we wish to analyze the general logarithm correction in entropy product formula due to the effect of thermal fluctuations around equilibrium .",
    "whenever we have taken into account of the quantum fluctuations the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula should be corrected that indicates the bekenstein - hawking entropy product formula of @xmath4 should also be corrected .",
    "this is the motivation behind this work .",
    "we have explicitly examined by giving some specific examples .",
    "the fact is that certain bhs ( in einstein gravity or other theories of gravity ) have larger than the planck scale length where the entropy is proportional to the horizon area @xcite .",
    "therefore there has been another motivation to find what the leading order corrections in bh entropy as well as in _ bh entropy product _ formula of @xmath4 when one reduces the size of the bh .",
    "it has been shown that in case of large bhs , the logarithm of the density of states is precisely the bh entropy with the corrections @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the area of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore it could be seen that the logarithmic corrections to bekenstein - hawking entropy of @xmath4 is a generic property of bhs .",
    "in this section we shall derive the logarithmic corrections to bh entropy ( which will be the _ master formula _ of our investigation ) for any thermodynamic system whose _ specific heat is positive _ that means the corresponding canonical ensemble is thermodynamically stable .",
    "thus this calculation is valid for all bhs whose specific heat is being positive .    to determine the leading order corrections to bh entropy of @xmath4 of any thermodynamical system due to small statistical fluctuations around equilibrium , we should follow the work by das et al .",
    "@xcite . in the micro canonical thermodynamical system",
    "the partition function computed at @xmath4 may be defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the temperature of the @xmath4 .",
    "we set boltzmann constant @xmath13 to be unity .",
    "the density of states of @xmath4 can be expressed as an inverse laplace transformation of the partition function : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a real constant and we have defined @xmath16 is the exact entropy as a function of temperature , not just its value at equilibrium .    now close to the equilibrium inverse temperature @xmath17 , we may expand the entropy function of @xmath4 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath17 .    substituting ( [ sbs0 ] ) in ( [ ipf ] )",
    "@xmath21    defining @xmath22 and choosing @xmath23 , @xmath24 is a real variable and computing a contour integration one can obtain @xmath25 the logarithm of the @xmath26 gives the corrected entropy of @xmath4 : @xmath27    this formula is applicable to all the thermodynamic system considered as a canonical ensemble , including bh consisting of @xmath4 .",
    "now from the idea of statistical mechanics the mean value of energy @xcite of any thermodynamical system is given by @xmath28 and the square value of the energy is given by @xmath29    the fluctuations are equal to the differences between special measured values @xmath30 and the mean value @xmath31 , or @xmath32 thus the mean value of the square of the fluctuation in energy is given by @xmath33~.\\label{sqeng}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this may be rewritten as @xmath34 the mean square of the fluctuation in energy is seen to be determined by thermodynamic quantities only .",
    "it is proportional to the heat capacity @xmath35 .",
    "this specific heat can be defined as @xmath36 \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{s_{0 , \\pm}''}{t_{\\pm}^2}~.\\label{engsh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it immediately follows that @xmath37 using ( [ eng2pf ] ) and ( [ ct2 ] ) we get the leading order corrections to the black hole entropy is given by @xmath38 to compute this entropy of @xmath4 , we would replace @xmath39 by @xmath39 , the hawking temperature and then we compute the specific heat @xmath35 for specific bhs having event horizon ( eh ) and cauchy horizon ( ch ) . without loss of generality , to make definite positivity of specific heat in the logarithmic term",
    "we have made key assumption that @xmath40 .",
    ". [ canoetp ] can be re - written as @xmath41 thus their product is found to be @xmath42\\ ] ] @xmath43 this is the key result of our investigation .",
    "now let us see what is the implication of this formula ?",
    "when we taking consideration the first order correction , it implies that the product is always dependent on mass .",
    "thus the theorem of ansorg - hennig@xcite `` the area ( or entropy ) product formula is independent of mass '' is not universal when we taking into consideration the leading order logarithmic correction .",
    "now we give some specific examples to explain it more detail .",
    "_ example 1 _ : first we consider the four dimensional reissner nordstrm ( rn ) bh . the bekenstein - hawking entropy and hawking temperature reads as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are mass and charge of the bh respectively .",
    "the specific heat is given by @xmath48 here , @xmath40",
    "when @xmath49 .",
    ", one can find the following thermodynamic quantities at @xmath1 : @xmath50    therefore , the entropy correction is given by @xmath51 it could be seen that the leading order corrections are logarithmic .",

    "now let us take another example say kehagias - sfetsos(ks ) bh @xcite in hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "_ example 2 _ : the entropy , hawking temperature and specific heat for ks bh@xcite are @xmath56,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is coupling constant , @xmath58 is called eh and @xmath59 is called ch . @xmath60 and @xmath61 here , @xmath40 when @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the entropy correction for ks bh is given by @xmath64    and their product yields @xmath65 @xmath66\\ ] ] @xmath67 again it indicates that when the logarithmic correction is taken into account the entropy product is not universal .",
    "now we are moving to the ads space , see what happens there ?",
    "first we consider schwarzschild - ads space - time .",
    "_ example 3 _ : the only one physical horizon @xcite is given by @xmath68 ~\\label{ehd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the entropy of @xmath0 is @xmath69\\right)^2 ~\\label{pd3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is cosmological constant .",

    "when @xmath74 .",
    "since in this case only one physical horizon that is eh , therefore the entropy correction formula , one obtains the schwarzschild bh . in this case",
    "the horizon is at @xmath75 and the specific heat is negative i.e. @xmath76 , to make it positive definite we have taken the @xmath77 to avoid the divergence in the logarithm term .",
    "therefore the log correction should be @xmath78 .",
    "this also implies that the correction should mass dependent .",
    "thus it is not universal .",
    "] should be @xmath79 although it is isolated case but it has still both log correction term and without log correction term depends upon the mass parameter so it is not quantized as well as not universal .",
    "now we consider the rn - ads case@xcite .",
    "_ example 4 _ : the quartic killing horizon equation becomes @xmath80 there are at least two physical horizons namely eh , @xmath58 and ch , @xmath59 .",
    "the entropy is given by @xmath81 the bh temperature of @xmath4 should read @xmath82 and the specific heat is given by @xmath83.~\\label{rn3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the specific heat @xmath40 definite when @xmath84 .    therefore the logarithmic correction turns out to be @xmath85 so we could not write the explicit product formula but it follows that the product of log correction should be mass dependent .    finally , we consider the simple rotating kerr bh :    _ example 5 _ :    the bh entropy and bh temperature are @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath46 and @xmath88 are mass and spin parameter of the bh respectively",
    ".    the specific heat @xcite is given by @xmath89 here , @xmath40",
    "when @xmath90 .",
    "finally the logarithmic correction is found to be @xmath91 once again when the logarithmic correction is taken into account the entropy product of @xmath4 is not mass - independent .",
    "lastly , we consider the kerr - newman bh :    _ example 6 _ :    the bh entropy and bh temperature are @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath46 , @xmath94 and @xmath47 are mass , spin parameter and charge of the bh respectively .",
    "the specific heat @xcite is @xmath95 here , @xmath40",
    "when @xmath96 .",
    "finally the logarithmic correction is found to be @xmath97 once once again when the logarithmic correction is taken into account the entropy product of @xmath4 for kerr - newman bh @xcite is not mass - independent .",
    "thus we can conclude from the above examples that when the logarithmic correction is considered the area ( or entropy ) product formula should _ not be universal_. this result should be valid for spherically symmetric regular@xcite bh , and kn - ads bh @xcite also .",
    "in this work , we have calculated the general logarithmic corrections in black hole entropy product formula by considering the stable thermal fluctuations around the equilibrium .",
    "we examined by giving some specific examples that whenever we taking the first order correction the entropy product formula should not be quantized nor does it mass - independent .",
    "we have made a key assumptions to avoid the divergence in the logarithm term is that the absolute value of specific heat for all horizons is always positive .",
    "all the derivations in this letter is valid for non - rotating bhs as well as rotating bhs . for extreme bh , @xmath98",
    ", hence the thermal fluctuation analysis ceases to be valid only for large quantum fluctuations ."
