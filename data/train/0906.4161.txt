    "over the past four decades , an enormous effort has been dedicated to developing two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) engineered at the interface of semiconductor heterostructures , and optimising their low temperature transport properties  @xcite .",
    "it is now possible to achieve low temperature mobilities in excess of @xmath4 in high quality gaas - algaas heterostructures  @xcite , and there is continued interest in further improving 2deg mobilities  @xcite .",
    "phenomena that are only observed in ultra - high mobility 2degs include anisotropies , stripe and bubble phases in higher landau levels  @xcite , microwave induced resistance oscillations  @xcite , and even denominator fractional quantum hall states  @xcite . the latter have attracted considerable interest due to proposals for topological quantum computers that use the possible non - abelian nature of the @xmath5 fractional quantum hall state  @xcite .",
    "since these even denominator fractional quantum hall states are only observed in ultra - high mobility 2degs at very low temperatures ( @xmath6 ) , there is renewed interest in understanding the factors limiting the electron mobility in gaas heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "the maximum attainable electron mobility is limited by phonon scattering , which can not be avoided .",
    "however for low temperatures , @xmath7k , phonon scattering is negligible , and the mobility is limited by other mechanisms . in gaas heterostructures these include interface roughness scattering , remote ionised impurity scattering , and background impurity scattering .",
    "interface roughness scattering is not important in high quality heterointerfaces at low densities , so the low @xmath8 mobility is limited by ionised impurity scattering  @xcite . in most two - dimensional gaas systems",
    "the carriers are introduced by modulation doping of the algaas , and this modulation doping provides a significant source of remote ionised impurity scattering  @xcite .",
    "remote ionised impurity scattering can be reduced with the use of large undoped algaas ` spacer ' layers between the 2deg and the modulation doping  @xcite , or eliminated entirely with accumulation mode devices in which the carriers are introduced electrostatically rather than through doping  @xcite .",
    "finally there are always ` background impurities ' incorporated in the crystal during the epitaxial growth process , and these will limit the mobility in both the very cleanest modulation doped samples  @xcite and in electrostatically doped samples .    in practice , experimentally determining the factors limiting the mobility in a particular sample is non - trivial , since many scattering mechanisms may be acting together .",
    "there are two key experimental parameters available to try and separate the different scattering mechanisms : the transport scattering time @xmath9 , obtained from the conductivity , and the single - particle relaxation time ( also known as the quantum lifetime ) @xmath10 , obtained from the shubnikov - de haas oscillations . for short range isotropic scattering",
    "the two times are equivalent ( e.g. in silicon mosfets ) , but for long range coulomb interactions ( e.g. from modulation doping ) @xmath1 and @xmath0 are quite different  @xcite .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that @xmath0 counts all scattering events , while @xmath9 is weighted towards large - angle scattering events that cause a significant change in the momentum . by comparing the measured @xmath1 and @xmath0 with numerical calculations",
    "it is possible to determine the nature of the predominant scattering mechanism in a 2deg at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for background impurity scattering in ultra - high mobility 2d systems , since the impurity levels are so low that they can not be measured by direct tools such as deep level transient spectroscopy .",
    "while the transport scattering rates can be calculated using first order perturbation theory for a variety of scattering mechanisms , direct comparison between experimental measurements and theoretical calculations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 in high mobility samples have been limited by a problem in calculating the single - particle relaxation time for background impurity scattering : there is no lowest order result for the single - particle relaxation time for homogeneous background doping due a divergent integral  @xcite . in a series of papers , gold and",
    "gtze extended the theoretical formalism to include multiple scattering effects in both the transport and single - particle cases  @xcite .",
    "this made it possible to calculate the ` renormalized ' single - particle lifetime for scattering from homogeneous background impurities  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we re - examine the scattering lifetime due to background impurities , and explicitly highlight how the logarithmic divergence in @xmath0 is due to the assumption of an infinitely thick heterostructure in refs .",
    "we derive a non - divergent scattering lifetime for a finite thickness heterostructure , both in the lowest order perturbation theory approach and in the multiple scattering theory . comparing these two approaches",
    "shows how the existing multiple scattering theory can lead to inaccurate scattering lifetimes in high quality heterostructures .",
    "finally we present the first comparison of theoretical results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 with experimental data from a gaas 2deg with only background impurity scattering .",
    "we obtain excellent agreement between the calculations and experimental data , and are able to extract the background impurity density in both the gaas and algaas regions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in section ii we review the standard concepts and expressions for ionised impurity scattering in a 2deg , with special emphasis on homogenous background scattering , and introduce the correct expression for background impurity scattering in a finite thickness sample . in section iii",
    "we evaluate these expressions for background impurity scattering , and compare the different approaches to calculating the single particle and quantum lifetimes . in section iv we compare our results with experimental data , followed by conclusions in section v.",
    "we restrict our analysis to 2degs at @xmath11 , and concentrate on re - examining how the scattering lifetimes are calculated for background impurity scattering , since other scattering mechanisms are readily treated with first order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "most gaas - algaas heterostructures share a common layer structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ( induced device ) ] : a gaas substrate / buffer with algaas layer(s ) above , and the 2deg accumulated at the heterointerface",

    "for the purposes of evaluating background impurity scattering , both types of heterostructure can be treated as consisting essentially of two layers : a gaas substrate below the 2deg of thickness @xmath12 , and algaas layers on top of thickness @xmath13",
    "@xcite .          in the lowest order of approximation ,",
    "the transport and single - particle scattering lifetimes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are calculated at @xmath11 by integrating the scattering potential @xmath14 with respect to the scattered wavevector @xmath15 : @xmath16 equations ( [ eqn : lowerordertaut ] ) and ( [ eqn : lowerordertauq ] ) can be derived via fermi s golden rule or by invoking the second klauder approximation to the self - energy @xmath17 , where the formalism is presented in  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath18 is the electron effective mass ( taken as @xmath19 for gaas ) and @xmath20 is the fermi wave vector , which in two - dimensional reciprocal space is a measure of the radius of the mass - shell at @xmath11 .",

    "it is necessary to divide the bulk sample into infinitesimal layers , and treat each layer as a @xmath27-doped layer of remote ionized impurities at a distance @xmath28 from the 2deg .",
    "the scattering potential due to one of these @xmath27-doped layers is : @xmath29 is the two - dimensional impurity density in the @xmath27-doped layer and @xmath30 is the form factor that accounts for the finite thickness of the 2deg .",
    "there are two form factors , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for scattering sites located in the algaas and gaas regions respectively  @xcite : @xmath33 @xmath34 the difference between the two form factors is due to the overlap between the wave function of the 2deg and the background impurities in the gaas region .",
    "the total scattering potential is obtained by summing the contribution from all of the delta - layers : @xmath35 to obtain : @xmath36    the three - dimensional background impurity density is now defined by @xmath37",

    "( [ eqn : lowerordertaut ] ) is well behaved , but eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lowerordertauq ] ) diverges as @xmath38 and can not be evaluated .",
    "the divergence in @xmath0 for background impurity scattering arises from the infinite limits in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : backgroundinfinitesum ] ) , which physically corresponds to an infinite sample , containing an infinite number of charged impurities located far from the 2deg .",
    "these charged background impurities , most of which are located far from the 2deg , lead to a divergence in the small angle ( small @xmath15 ) scattering rate due to the @xmath39 term in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : rii_scattering_uq ] ) , and hence to a divergence in @xmath10 .",
    "however the transport lifetime is convergent since it is less sensitive to small angle scattering events .",
    "the non - physical assumption of an infinitely thick sample has been a common assumption in previous calculations of background impurity scattering  @xcite .",
    "to solve the problem of the logarithmic divergence in the single - particle scattering rate , it is tempting to simply modify the lower limit of the integral in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lowerordertauq ] ) and replace it with the uncertainty of the 2d scattered wave vector @xmath15 .",
    "however , there are several problems with this approach .",
    "first of all , the integrand in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lowerordertauq ] ) contributes most strongly near the two limits of integration .",
    "thus the result of the integral is extremely sensitive to any modifications of these two limits .",
    "secondly one requires a precise knowledge of all the physical constraints that specify the uncertainty in @xmath15 regarding the system of interest .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath15 will depend on some of the same parameters that affect the scattering rate that one intends to calculate .",
    "only an approach which addresses the problem self - consistently would allow one to be confident of the results .",
    "thirdly even if one can remove the logarithmic divergence with this approach , there still exists the assumption that the heterostructure is infinitely thick .",
    "this assumption is not only physically unsound , but also produces inaccurate results as we demonstrate in section iii .",
    "the conventional way around the logarithmic divergence in the integral for @xmath0 is to use the multiple scattering theory developed by gold to calculate the renormalized single - particle scattering lifetime @xmath40",
    "the starting point for incorporating multiple scattering effects into the single - particle lifetime is to use the single - particle green s function with the mass - shell and third klauder approximations  @xcite .",
    "taking into account only electron - impurity interactions ( _ i.e. _ neglecting electron - electron interactions ) one arrives at the following expression for @xmath40 : @xmath41    eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : tauqrdoubleint ] ) is a self - consistent equation with a double integral that must be solved recursively to obtain @xmath40 .",

    "<S> we re - examine the quantum @xmath0 and transport @xmath1 scattering lifetimes due to background impurities in two - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the well - known logarithmic divergence in the quantum lifetime is due to the non - physical assumption of an infinitely thick heterostructure , and demonstrate that the existing non - divergent multiple scattering theory can lead to unphysical quantum scattering lifetimes in high quality heterostructures . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a non - divergent scattering lifetime for finite thickness structures , which can be used both with lowest order perturbation theory and the multiple scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the quantum and transport lifetimes for electrons in generic gaas - algaas heterostructures , and find that the correct ` rule of thumb ' to distinguish the dominant scattering mechanisms in gaas heterostructures should be @xmath2 for background impurities and @xmath3 for remote impurities . </S>",
    "<S> finally we present the first comparison of theoretical results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 with experimental data from a gaas 2deg in which only background impurity scattering is present . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain excellent agreement between the calculations and experimental data , and are able to extract the background impurity density in both the gaas and algaas regions . </S>"
