    "the prototype for the idea of this paper is the well - known correspondence between @xmath1-symmetric instantons ( or hyperbolic bps monopoles ) and the discrete nahm equation .",
    "recall that self - dual yang - mills instantons on @xmath0 correspond to adhm data @xcite , which consist of matrices satisfying certain algebraic constraints .",
    "if we impose an @xmath1 symmetry on the instantons , then the corresponding dimensional reduction gives hyperbolic monopoles @xcite , in other words bps monopoles on hyperbolic 3-space @xmath3 .",
    "such an @xmath1 action is classified by a positive integer  @xmath4 ; and then the monopole mass , or equivalently the asymptotic norm of the monopole higgs field , is @xmath5 . for a given value of @xmath4 , su(2 ) hyperbolic monopoles of charge @xmath6 are the same as su(2 ) instantons of charge @xmath7 . with suitable scaling",
    ", the @xmath8 limit corresponds to the curvature of the hyperbolic space tending to zero ; in other words the hyperbolic monopole tends to a monopole on @xmath9 .",
    "now bps monopoles on @xmath9 correspond , via the nahm transform @xcite , to solutions of the nahm equation , which is a set of ordinary differential equations on an interval of the real line .",
    "so one might expect the @xmath1-symmetric adhm constraints to be a discrete ( lattice ) version of the nahm equation , tending to it as @xmath8 ; and this is exactly what happens @xcite .",
    "this discrete nahm equation , which is a special case of the algebraic adhm constraints , forms an integrable one - dimensional lattice system @xcite ,    the subject of the present paper is to extend this idea to the case where there are two commuting circle symmetries rather than just one .",
    "so the starting - point is @xmath2-symmetric yang - mills instantons on @xmath0 , and the corresponding @xmath2-symmetric adhm data .",
    "such a @xmath2-action is characterized by a pair of positive integers @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "one special case which has been known for a long time is where @xmath12 or @xmath13 : this corresponds to spherically - symmetric hyperbolic monopoles of unit charge @xcite .",
    "the case of general @xmath14 was studied shortly afterwards @xcite , mainly in the context of instantons invariant under a finite cyclic group @xmath15 .",
    "the relevant expressions for such @xmath2-symmetric adhm data are reviewed in section  2 below . in section  3 , however , we forget about @xmath2-symmetric instantons as such , and focus on the constraint equations for the adhm data .",
    "it turns out that these may be interpreted as a two - dimensional lattice version of the hitchin equations @xcite , a gauge - theory system on @xmath16 ( or more generally on riemann surfaces ) .",
    "this lattice system is completely - integrable , in the sense of being the compatibility condition for a lax pair of lattice operators , and it tends to the hitchin system of partial differential equations as @xmath17 .",
    "the structure of the adhm data for @xmath2-symmetric su(2 ) instantons was described in @xcite , using the version of the adhm constraint equations due to donaldson @xcite .",
    "this section summarizes the relevant aspects , in a form suitable for our purposes here .    the data for su(2 ) instantons of charge @xmath18 consists @xcite of four complex matrices",
    "@xmath19 , where the @xmath20 are @xmath21 , @xmath22 is @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is @xmath25 .",
    "they satisfy the equation @xmath26 + ba=0,\\ ] ] and are required to be generic ( _ ie . _  to satisfy a maximal - rank condition ) .",
    "the ` gauge freedom ' in this data is @xmath27 where @xmath28gl(@xmath29 ) and @xmath30su(2 ) .",
    "the @xmath31-dimensional moduli space of instantons is the space of generic solutions of ( [ don_eqn1 ] ) , factored out by ( [ don_gauge ] ) . to convert @xmath19 into adhm data ,",
    "one also needs to solve @xmath32 + [ \\alpha_2 , \\alpha_2^*]+bb^*-a^*a = 0,\\ ] ] which has an essentially - unique solution @xcite . here",
    "@xmath33 denotes the complex - conjugate transpose of @xmath24 .",
    "now the standard action of so(4 ) on @xmath0 induces an action on the space of instantons , and we are interested in instantons which are invariant under the action of the maximal torus @xmath34 in so(4 ) .",
    "such @xmath2-symmetric instantons are classified by a pair @xmath14 of positive integers , with @xmath35 . for each choice of @xmath14 ,",
    "the solution space is 1-dimensional @xcite . from the instanton point of view",
    "this is because , given the imposed symmetry , the only remaining free parameter is the instanton scale .",
    "this in turn corresponds to an overall positive factor on the data @xmath19 .",
    "alternatively , thinking in terms of hyperbolic monopoles , we have a rotationally - symmetric hyperbolic monopole with a fixed axis of symmetry , and the free parameter is then the location of the monopole on its axis .",
    "the hyperbolic monopole has mass @xmath36 and charge @xmath11 .",
    "( from the instanton point of view , this is the same solution as a hyperbolic monopole of mass @xmath37 and charge @xmath10 : the swap - map @xmath38 has recently been used in the study of symmetric hyperbolic monopoles @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2-symmetric adhm - donaldson data may be written in the following form ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) . for a positive integer @xmath4 ,",
    "define @xmath39 matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 by @xmath42 @xmath43 then set @xmath44 @xmath45 , \\quad      b=\\left[\\begin{matrix } b_0 & 0 & \\ldots & 0 \\\\              0 & 0 & \\ldots & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right]^t.\\ ] ] here @xmath46 denotes the kronecker product of an @xmath47 matrix @xmath48 and an @xmath49 matrix @xmath50",
    ". the variables @xmath51 ( for @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are all positive real numbers .",
    "then the equations ( [ don_eqn1 ] ) and ( [ don_eqn2 ] ) become , respectively , @xmath59 @xmath60 in equation ( [ fgeqn2 ] ) , the indices have the range @xmath52 , @xmath56 , but undefined terms are to be omitted ; for example , if @xmath61 then the first term is omitted , since there is no variable @xmath62 .",
    "the ` stars ' are unnecessary in ( [ fgeqn2 ] ) , since the variables are real numbers ; but we retain them because the variables will become complex matrices in the next section .",
    "the system ( [ fgeqn1 ] , [ fgeqn2 ] ) consists of @xmath63 equations for @xmath64 variables , and has a one - parameter family of solutions , as mentioned previously .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath65 we get five equations for six variables , and the solution is @xmath66 , @xmath67 , with @xmath68 arbitrary .",
    "the case @xmath69 , @xmath70 is mentioned as an example in @xcite . for @xmath69 , @xmath71",
    "the solution is @xmath72 @xmath73 several other cases can be solved explicitly , but for general @xmath14 the solution is not known explicitly ( and may not be expressible in radicals ) . a numerical solution for the case @xmath74 is illustrated in the next section .",
    "finally in this section , let us consider the limit @xmath75 , with @xmath69 fixed .",
    "one way of interpreting this is as an axially - symmetric hyperbolic monopole of charge @xmath4 on a fixed hyperbolic space , letting @xmath8 to obtain a hyperbolic magnetic disc ; such a limit was recently described in detail in @xcite for the case @xmath12 .",
    "alternatively , we may think of an axially - symmetric 2-monopole on a hyperbolic space with curvature @xmath76 : then the limit @xmath8 should yield the nahm data for the axially - symmetric 2-monopole on @xmath9 . to take this limit , we can follow the same pattern as in @xcite .",
    "regard the index @xmath77 as labelling a one - dimensional lattice with lattice spacing @xmath78 , and put @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "then the limit @xmath8 leaves us with the differential equations @xmath82 the relevant solution of this is @xmath83 which corresponds to the nahm data for an axially - symmetric 2-monopole on @xmath9 .",
    "in the equations ( [ don_eqn1 ] , [ don_eqn2 ] ) , the vectors @xmath22 and @xmath24 play the role of boundary terms , and the interior terms only involve @xmath20 .",
    "if we focus on the interior equations by setting @xmath84 , then the remaining equations are , in effect , the self - dual yang - mills equations reduced to zero dimensions .",
    "the idea now is to forget about instantons as such , and simply to regard ( [ fgeqn1 ] ) , and ( [ fgeqn2 ] ) with @xmath85 , namely @xmath86 as a two - dimensional lattice system .",
    "the objects @xmath51 and @xmath54 no longer need to be real numbers : instead , we allow them to be complex @xmath87 matrices .",
    "so the order of the factors in each of the terms of ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) becomes important .",
    "the claim is that the resulting system is an integrable lattice version of the u(@xmath88 ) hitchin equations on @xmath16 .    in",
    "what follows , we shall take @xmath89 for simplicity , but it is straightforward to relax this condition .",
    "the question of what boundary conditions one might want to add to ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) is left open for the moment .",
    "the hitchin equations @xcite may be thought of as the self - dual yang - mills equations reduced to @xmath16 , obtained by factoring out two translations in @xmath0 , and the resulting system is as follows .",
    "let @xmath90 denote the usual @xmath16 coordinates , @xmath91 a gauge potential , and @xmath92 a pair of higgs fields .",
    "take the gauge group to be u(@xmath88 ) , so that @xmath93 are antihermitian @xmath87 matrices .",
    "then the hitchin equations are @xmath94 , \\quad d_x\\phi_1=-d_y\\phi_2,\\quad d_x\\phi_2=d_y\\phi_1,\\ ] ] where @xmath95 $ ] is the gauge field , and @xmath96 $ ] ( similarly for @xmath97 ) are the covariant derivatives of @xmath98 .",
    "the lattice equations ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) are a discrete version of ( [ heqns ] ) in the following sense .",
    "let us take the continuum limit by extending the method of @xcite and the previous section .",
    "namely , put @xmath99 and @xmath100 , write @xmath101 and take the limit @xmath8 .",
    "the result is the hitchin system ( [ heqns ] ) .",
    "the lattice system ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) is integrable simply by virtue of being a special case of the adhm constraints , but one can also see directly that it arises from a lattice lax pair .",
    "this is analogous to the lax pair for the discrete nahm equations @xcite .",
    "let @xmath102 be the operator which steps forward in the first index , namely @xmath103 ; and similarly let @xmath104 be the operator which steps forward in the second index . define a pair of operators on lattice @xmath88-vectors by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a complex parameter .",
    "then @xmath107=0 $ ] for all @xmath106 if and only if the equations  ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) hold .",
    "in other words , the lattice system  ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) is an integrable discretization of the hitchin equations  ( [ heqns ] ) .",
    "note that if we replace @xmath108 by the equivalent operators @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and take the limit @xmath8 using the expressions  ( [ ctmlimit ] ) , then we get the usual lax pair @xmath111 for the hitchin equations  ( [ heqns ] ) .",
    "since the hitchin system has a u(@xmath88 ) gauge invariance , one might expect the discrete version to have a local gauge invariance on the lattice , and this is indeed the case .",
    "indeed , the equations ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) are invariant under @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a u(@xmath88)-valued function on the lattice .    as an example , consider the simplest case @xmath114 , so the gauge group is u(1 ) .",
    "the continuum system is then linear , and in fact reduces to the cauchy - riemann equation @xmath115 .",
    "but the discrete system remains nonlinear .",
    "one may choose a gauge such that @xmath51 and @xmath54 are real - valued and positive , and the equations ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) then become @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes forward difference in the first index , @xmath118 backward difference in the first index , and similarly with @xmath119 referring to the second index .",
    "so from this point of view , the system ( [ eqns1_r ] ) is an integrable nonlinear discretization of the cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "one particular solution corresponds to instanton data : for this one imposes boundary conditions as in ( [ fgeqn2 ] ) . numerical solution of the equations when @xmath89 indicates that this solution satisfies @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; and such a numerically - obtained solution is plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] for the case @xmath122 .    .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    as yet , not much is known about the possible existence of explicit solutions  even in the simplest u(1 ) case  except for small values of @xmath4 . the simplest one which is defined on the infinite lattice seems to be @xmath123 where @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are real constants . whether one can find more general families of explicit solutions is an open question .",
    "we have seen that the algebraic constraints on adhm data for @xmath2-symmetric instantons can be generalized to give a set of lattice - gauge equations on a two - dimensional square lattice ; and this lattice system may be viewed as an integrable discrete version of the hitchin equations .",
    "since @xmath1-symmetric instantons may be interpreted as hyperbolic monopoles , we may view @xmath2-symmetric instantons in that context as axially - symmetric hyperbolic monopoles .",
    "but this treats the two circle actions differently , and a more even - handed interpretation of @xmath2-symmetric instantons is as a variant of the two - dimensional hitchin system .",
    "let us write the @xmath0 coordinates @xmath127 as @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and reduce by invariance in the @xmath130-directions .",
    "the gauge - potential components @xmath131 then become higgs fields @xmath98 .",
    "if we write @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 $ ] , then the reduced self - dual yang - mills equations become @xmath135 , \\quad d_1\\phi_1=-(r_1/r_2)d_2\\phi_2 .",
    "\\quad d_1\\phi_2=(r_2/r_1)d_2\\phi_1,\\ ] ] this is therefore an integrable variant of the standard hitchin system ( [ heqns ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ heqns_curved ] ) is invariant under @xmath136 , with @xmath98 having conformal weight zero . solutions of ( [ heqns_curved ] ) which actually correspond to instantons satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath137 as @xmath138 for @xmath139 , in terms of the two integers @xmath140 . for each pair",
    "@xmath14 , the equation ( [ heqns_curved ] ) has a one - parameter of ` instantonic ' solutions , corresponding to the solutions of ( [ fgeqn1 ] , [ fgeqn2 ] ) .",
    "one open question is whether less restrictive boundary conditions would allow more interesting moduli spaces of solutions of ( [ heqns_curved ] ) , no longer corresponding to instantons .",
    "clearly many other questions remain open as well . for example",
    ", it is likely that one could develop a more comprehensive treatment of the complete - integrability of the discrete system , in particular through understanding its spectral data , along the lines of what was done for the discrete nahm equations @xcite .",
    "another question is whether it is possible to impose boundary conditions on the lattice system ( [ fgeqn3 ] ) which allow nice moduli spaces of solutions , and/or a generalized nahm transform . in the special case corresponding to @xmath2-symmetric instantons ,",
    "this nahm transform is the adhm transform ; but this case is rather special , with each solution space being just one - dimensional . the hitchin equations  ( [ heqns ] ) admit a rich collection of moduli spaces of solutions , and whether any of this extends to the discrete version remains open .",
    "a final remark is that our starting - point above was the adhm construction for @xmath1- and @xmath2-symmetric instantons with gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "recently the @xmath1-symmetric case has been generalized to describe the discrete nahm equations corresponding to su(@xmath18 ) hyperbolic monopoles @xcite , and it might be interesting to see what happens for @xmath2-symmetric instantons for larger gauge group .    *",
