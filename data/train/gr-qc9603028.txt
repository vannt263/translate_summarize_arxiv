    "among the possible sources of gravitational waves , coalescing compact binaries are considered to be the most promising candidates for detection by near - future , ground based laser interferometric detectors such as ligo @xcite , virgo@xcite , geo600 , tama and aigo .",
    "there are two reasons for this : first , we can expect sufficiently large amplitude of gravitational waves from these systems .",
    "second , the estimated event rate , for neutron star binaries , is several / yr within 200mpc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observations of coalescing compact binaries are potentially important because they bring us new physical and astronomical information . they can be used to test general relativity @xcite , to measure cosmological parameters @xcite and neutron star radii .",
    "it may even be possible to obtain information about the equation of state of neutron stars@xcite .",
    "if a neutron star or a small black hole spirals into a massive black hole with mass @xmath4 , the inspiral wave form will be detected by the above detectors .",
    "such wave forms carry detailed information about the spacetime geometry around the black hole , and therefore may be used to test the black hole no hair theorem@xcite .",
    "when a gravitational wave signal is detected , matched filtering will be used to extract the binary s parameters ( i.e. masses , spins , ets.)@xcite . in this method ,",
    "the parameters are determined by cross - correlating the noisy signal from the detectors with theoretical templates .",
    "if the signal and the templates lose phase with each other by one cycle over @xmath5 cycles as the waves sweep through the ligo / virgo band , their cross correlation will be significantly reduced .",
    "this means that we need to construct theoretical templates which are accurate to better than one cycle during entire sweep through the ligo / virgo band @xcite .",
    "if we have accurate templates , we can , in principle , determine the mass of the systems within 1% error @xcite .",
    "thus , much effort has been expended to construct accurate theoretical templates @xcite .",
    "the standard method to calculate inspiraling wave forms from coalescing binaries is the post - newtonian expansion of the einstein equations , in which the orbital velocity @xmath6 of the binaries are assumed to be small compared to the speed of light . since , for coalescing binaries , the orbital velocity is not so small when the frequency of gravitational waves is in ligo / virgo band , it is necessary to carry the post - newtonian expansion up to extremely high order in @xmath6 .",
    "a post - newtonian wave generation formalism which can handle the high order calculation has been developed by blanchet , damour and iyer@xcite .",
    "based on this formalism , calculations have been carried out up to post@xmath7-newtonian order , or @xmath8 beyond the leading order quadrupole formula[12 - 20 ] . an another formalism",
    "is also developed up to @xmath9 by will and wiseman@xcite which is based on epstein - wagoner s formalism@xcite .",
    "although the post - newtonian calculation technique will be developed and applied to the higher order calculation , it will become more difficult and complicated .",
    "thus , it would be very helpful if we could have another reliable method to calculate the higher order post - newtonian corrections .",
    "recently the post - newtonian expansion based on black hole perturbation formalism is developed . in this analysis",
    ", one considers gravitational waves from a particle of mass @xmath10 orbiting a black hole of mass @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",
    "although this method is restricted to the case when @xmath13 , one can calculate very high order post - newtonian corrections to gravitational waves using a relatively simple algorithm in contrast with the standard post - newtonian analysis .",
    "this direction of research was first done analytically by poisson @xcite who worked to @xmath14 and numerically by cutler et.al .",
    "@xcite to @xmath8 .",
    "subsequently , a highly accurate numerical calculation was carried out by tagoshi and nakamura @xcite to @xmath0 in which they found the appearance of @xmath15 terms in the energy flux at @xmath1 and at @xmath0 .",
    "they also clarified that the accuracy of the energy flux to at least @xmath1 is needed to construct template wave forms for coalescing binaries .",
    "tagoshi and sasaki@xcite , using the formulation built up by sasaki @xcite , performed analytic calculations which confirmed the result of tagoshi and nakamura .",
    "these calculations were extended to a rotating black hole case by shibata , sasaki , tagoshi and tanaka(sstt)@xcite to @xmath8 .",
    "they calculated gravitational waves from a particle in circular orbit with small inclination from the equatorial plane to see the effect of spin at high post - newtonian orders .",
    "they found that the effect of spin on the orbital phase is important at @xmath8 order when one of the stars is a rapidly rotating neutron star with its pulse period less than 2 ms or a rapidly rotating black hole with @xmath16 .",
    "this analysis was extended to the case of slightly eccentric orbits by tagoshi @xcite .",
    "the absorption of gravitational waves into the black hole horizon , appearing at @xmath0 , was also calculated by poisson and sasaki in the case when a test particle is in a circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend these analyses in the rotating black hole case to @xmath0 order . once again , the calculation is based on the formalism developed by sasaki@xcite to treat a schwarzschild black hole . based on the post - newtonian expansion of the luminosity in the test particle limit when the central body is a schwarzschild black hole ( @xcite ) , cutler and flanagan @xcite estimated that we will have to calculate post - newtonian expansion of gravitational wave luminosity at least up to @xmath1 in order to obtain the theoretical templates which cause less systematic errors than statistical errors for the ligo detector",
    "further , in a previous paper @xcite , we suggested that the effect of spin at @xmath1 to the orbital phase of coalescing binaries would nt be negligible if spin of the black hole was large ( i.e. @xmath17 ) .",
    "also , the perturbation study can provide accurate templates for binaries with @xmath18(for example , binaries of @xmath19 black hole-@xmath20 neutron star ) .",
    "since ligo and virgo will be able to detect gravitational wave signals from binaries with masses less than @xmath21 , it is important to construct templates for such binaries .",
    "the frequency of gravitational waves from such a massive binary , however , comes into the frequency band for ligo and virgo at @xmath22 , i.e. , highly relativistic region .",
    "we do not know whether the convergence property of the post - newtonian approximation is good or not in such a highly relativistic motion .",
    "hence , it is an urgent problem to clarify at what point the convergence property of the post - newtonian expansion is good . for these purposes",
    ", we study the effect of spin beyond @xmath1 order in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the basic formalism to perform the post - newtonian expansion in our perturbative approach .",
    "first we perform the post - newtonian expansion of the teukolsky radial function using the sasaki - nakamura equation .",
    "we also show the post - newtonian expansion of the angular equation , which is given in appendix f. in section 3 , we first describe the post - newtonian expansion of the source terms .",
    "we consider circular orbits in the equatorial plane around a kerr black hole .",
    "then the gravitational wave luminosities to @xmath0 beyond the quadrupole formula are derived . in section 4 , we compare post - newtonian formulas with numerical data which gives the exact value of gravitational wave luminosity and investigate the convergence property of the post - newtonian expansion .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary and discussion .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the units of @xmath23 .",
    "we consider the case when a test particle of mass @xmath10 travels in a circular orbit around a kerr black hole of mass @xmath24 .",
    "we follow the notation used by sstt@xcite , but for definiteness , we recapitulate necessary formulas and definitions .    to calculate gravitational radiation from a particle orbiting a kerr black hole , we start with the teukolsky equation@xcite .",
    "we focus on the radiation going out to infinity described by the fourth newman - penrose quantity , @xmath25  @xcite , which may be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spheroidal harmonic function of spin weight @xmath28 , which is normalized as @xmath29 the radial function @xmath30 obeys the teukolsky equation with spin weight @xmath28 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the source term whose explicit form will be shown later , and @xmath33 .",

    "we extend those methods , performing the expansion of homogeneous solutions up to @xmath48 .    in order to calculate gravitational waves emitted to infinity from a particle in a circular orbit , we need to know the explicit form of the source term @xmath32 , which has support only at @xmath51 where @xmath52 is orbital radius in the boyer - lindquist coordinate , the ingoing - wave teukolsky function @xmath53 at @xmath51 , and its incident amplitude @xmath54 at infinity .",
    "we consider the expansion of these quantities in terms of a small parameter , @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , we need to expand those quantity in terms of @xmath50 since @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the orbital angular velocity of the particle and @xmath58 . in the case of a kerr black hole , other combination of parameters",

    ", we ignore the effect of absorption of gravitational waves by the black hole .",
    "we will briefly discuss its effect in the next section .",
    "a numerical study of @xmath278 from a particle in a circular orbit in the equatorial plane around a kerr black hole has been performed by shibata@xcite . since nothing was assumed about the velocity of a test particle , those results are correct relativistically in the limit @xmath13 . in that work",
    ", @xmath278 was calculated with accuracy @xmath290 .",
    "however we found that this accuracy is not sufficient to compare it with the post - newtonian formula for @xmath278 including terms up to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in this paper , we calculate @xmath278 again requiring the accuracy to be @xmath291 . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we have taken into account the contribution from the @xmath77 through @xmath172 modes in @xmath278 which is consistent with the post - newtonian formula .    in figs.1(a@xmath144e )",

    "we show the error for @xmath296 .",
    "since the radius of the inner stable circular orbit for @xmath297 is @xmath298 and a stable circular orbit is possible for @xmath299 , we also show the errors in the case when @xmath297 for @xmath300 in fig.2 .",
    "the error in the post - newtonian formula is defined as @xmath301 where @xmath302 and @xmath303 denote the post - newtonian formula and the numerical results respectively . as for @xmath302 ,",
    "we have used 2-pn , 2.5-pn , 3-pn , 3.5-pn and 4-pn formulas . here , we define n - pn formula as the expression for @xmath278 which includes post - newtonian terms up to @xmath304 beyond the quadrupole formula . in each figure ,",
    "open square , filled triangle , open triangle , filled circle , and open circle denote the error of 2-pn , 2.5-pn , 3-pn , 3.5-pn and 4-pn formulas , respectively .",
    "we note that in fig.2 , the errors in the 2.5- , 3- and 4-pn formulas become greater than unity for very small radius , because in such a region , @xmath278 for those pn formulas becomes negative .    from these figures , we find the following .",
    "\\(1 ) if we use the 2-pn or 2.5-pn formula , the error is always greater than @xmath305 when @xmath306 irrespective of @xmath307 .",
    "if we use the 3-pn formula , however , the error decreases significantly , and it becomes less than @xmath305 for @xmath308 , and less than @xmath309 for @xmath310 irrespective of @xmath307 .",
    "\\(2 ) if we adopt the 3.5-pn formula , the accuracy becomes better than that of 3-pn formula .",
    "the error is always less than @xmath305 when @xmath311 is greater than @xmath312 and less than @xmath313 when @xmath311 is greater than @xmath314 .",
    "this feature does not depend on @xmath307 .",
    "however , if we use the 4-pn formula , the accuracy is not improved compared with the 3.5-pn formula . in particular",
    ", this tendency is remarkable for smaller radius .",
    "\\(3 ) the accuracy of the 3.5-pn or 4-pn formula is not always better than that of the lower - pn one inside @xmath315 , where @xmath316 for @xmath317 and @xmath295 , @xmath318 for @xmath280 and @xmath293 , and @xmath319 for @xmath292 .",
    "thus , the convergence of the post - newtonian expansion seems rather poor around @xmath315 .    using the above results",
    ", we investigate the accuracy of the post - newtonian formulas as templates for various binary systems .",
    "as explained in section 1 , to investigate the accuracy of the post - newtonian formulas as templates , it is useful to check if they can predict the number of cycles of the gravitational waves , @xmath320 , with accuracy less than 1 .",
    "compact binary systems , the cycles are mainly accumulated around @xmath321hz which is the lowest frequency region in the ligo band , and @xmath320 is approximately given by @xmath322 where @xmath11 and @xmath10 are the total mass and reduced mass , respectively .",
    "this means that the template must have an accuracy less than @xmath323 when the frequency of gravitational wave becomes @xmath324hz .",
    "first we consider equal mass binary systems , that is @xmath325 . at @xmath324hz , the orbital separation of a binary of total mass @xmath11",
    "is approximately given by @xmath326 .",
    "we find that the 2-pn and 2.5-pn formulas are insufficient if @xmath327 , and the 3-pn formula is needed .",
    "the 3-pn formula seems adequate irrespective of @xmath307 .    on the other hand , the situation is slightly different in the case when a neutron star of mass @xmath328 spirals into a larger black hole . in such a case ,",
    "the number of the cycles of the gravitational waves is large compared with the equal mass case when the total mass is the same .",
    "thus , it seems that we need at least the 3.5-pn formula for binaries of mass greater than @xmath329 to obtain the required accuracy .",
    "also , for binaries of mass greater than @xmath330 , we need higher post - newtonian corrections beyond 4-pn order .    binary systems of total mass greater than @xmath331 can be detected when @xmath311 is smaller than @xmath332 . however , as mentioned in ( 3 ) above , the convergence property of the post - newtonian expansion becomes bad for small orbital separations .",
    "in particular , for @xmath333 , the accuracy of the post - newtonian expansion seems bad at @xmath334 .",
    "thus , it may not be appropriate to use the post - newtonian approximation for binaries of total mass @xmath331 with large mass ratio @xmath13 .",
    "a more detailed investigations of the convergence of the post - newtonian expansion will require the calculation to be carried beyond 4-pn order .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a post - newtonian expansion of gravitational waves from a particle in a circular orbit around a kerr black hole .",
    "the orbit lies in the equatorial plane and the calculations are accurate to @xmath0 beyond the quadrupole level .",
    "we have performed the post - newtonian expansion of the sasaki - nakamura equation and obtained the green function of the radial teukolsky equation up to @xmath48 using methods developed previously .",
    "then we obtained all the necessary radial functions to the required accuracy .",
    "we have also calculated the spin weighted spheroidal harmonics up to @xmath64 .",
    "the outgoing wave amplitude of the teukolsky function and the gravitational wave luminosities were derived up to @xmath0 beyond the quadrupole formula .",
    "it is worth noting that in the formula for @xmath335 in appendix g , there are terms such as @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 . in a previous paper@xcite , we pointed out that the term @xmath337 can be explained in terms of the quadrupole formula as the contribution of the quadrupole moment of the kerr black hole to the orbit of the test particle .",
    "a similar explanation is possible for @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "we can derive those terms by using the quadrupole formula @xmath340 , where @xmath341 is the orbital radius of a test particle in de donder coordinates .",
    "if multipole moments of the black hole exist , the orbital radius is changed due to the influence of those multipole moments ( or if we fix the orbital radius , @xmath57 is changed due to the multipole moments of black hole ) .",
    "we can calculate the leading order effect of the multipole moments to the orbital radius by using multipole expansion of the kerr metric ( eq.(10.6 ) of ref.@xcite ) . in this way",
    ", we find that the dominant effect of the multipole moments of a kerr black hole to @xmath278 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath342 where @xmath343 and @xmath344 are mass and current multipole moments of a kerr black hole given by @xmath345 .",
    "now we can interpret the term @xmath346 as the effect of the current octopole moment of a black hole and the term @xmath347 as the effect of both the mass quadrupole moment and @xmath80 mass multipole moment of a black hole .",
    "as for @xmath77 and @xmath348 mode , there are terms @xmath349 , @xmath350 , @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "the terms @xmath349 and @xmath350 can be explained as the correction to the radiative current quadrupole moment @xcite  @xcite .",
    "we expect that the terms @xmath351 and @xmath352 can also be derived simply in a similar way .    in section 4 , by comparing post - newtonian formulas for @xmath278 with numerical data , we indicated that the convergence of the post - newtonian expansion seems bad when orbital radii of binaries become less than @xmath332 .",
    "this suggests that the post - newtonian expansion may not be appropriate to construct theoretical templates for large mass ratio binaries where the total mass is greater than @xmath353 because gravitational waves from such binaries enter the ligo / virgo frequency band when @xmath354 .",
    "nevertheless , the higher order post - newtonian terms gradually improve the accuracy of the templates .",
    "hence , it is very natural to ask whether the post - newtonian expansion is always appropriate or not , and if appropriate , up to what order we need the post - newtonian terms to construct accurate templates .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to obtain the formulas for @xmath278 which include post - newtonian order terms beyond @xmath0 by extending techniques developed in this paper .",
    "extension of the present work up to the higher post - newtonian order , beyond @xmath0 , is very important and that is our future work .",
    "the analysis , in this paper , has been restricted to the case when a test particle moves in a circular orbit on the equatorial plane . however , as shown in a previous paper@xcite , inclination of the orbital plane from the equatorial plane will significantly affect the orbital phase evolution .",
    "hence , the present work should be considered as a first step toward the complete calculation of the energy and angular momentum luminosities including the orbital inclination .",
    "finally , we comment on the effect of absorption of gravitational waves by the black hole event horizon which should be taken into account when we consider the orbital evolution of black hole binaries .",
    "according to galtsov@xcite , the lowest order contribution of the gravitational wave absorption to @xmath278 is given by @xmath355 thus , the effect of absorption appears from @xmath8 if @xmath356 .",
    "although the coefficient is small compared with that of @xmath278 for the outgoing wave even in the case @xmath17 , we need the expression for @xmath278 due to the black hole absorption to obtain an accurate template up to @xmath0 . therefore , to obtain the higher order post - newtonian corrections to the black hole absorption is a problem for the future",
