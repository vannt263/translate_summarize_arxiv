    "the coupling of two or more driven diffusive systems can give rise to intricate and interesting behavior , and this class of problems has attracted much recent attention .",
    "models of diverse phenomena , such as growth of binary films  @xcite , motion of stuck and flowing grains in a sandpile  @xcite , sedimentation of colloidal crystals  @xcite and the flow of passive scalars like ink or dye in fluids  @xcite involve two interacting fields . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on semiautonomously coupled systems  these are systems in which one field evolves independently and drives the second field .",
    "apart from being driven by the independent field , the passive field is also subject to noise , and the combination of driving and diffusion gives rise to interesting behavior .",
    "our aim in this paper is to understand and characterize the steady state of a passive field of this kind .",
    "+ the passive scalar problem is of considerable interest in the area of fluid mechanics and has been well studied , see  @xcite for reviews .",
    "apart from numerical studies , considerable understanding has been gained by analyzing the kraichnan model  @xcite where the velocity field of a fluid is replaced by a correlated gaussian velocity field .",
    "typical examples of passive scalars such as dye particles or a temperature field advected by a stirred fluid bring to mind pictures of spreading and mixing caused by the combined effect of fluid advection and diffusion . on the other hand ,",
    "if the fluid is compressible , or if the inertia of the scalars can not be neglected  @xcite , the scalars may cluster rather than spread out .",
    "it has been argued that there is a phase transition as a function of the compressibility of the fluid  at large compressibilities , the particle trajectories implode , while they explode in the incompressible or slightly compressible case  @xcite .",
    "it is the highly compressible case which is of interest in this paper .",
    "+ specifically , we study and characterize the steady state properties of passive , non - interacting particles sliding on a fluctuating surface and subject to noise  @xcite .",
    "the surface is the autonomously evolving field and the particles slide downwards along the local slope .",
    "we consider a surface evolving according to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation .",
    "this equation can be mapped to the well known burgers equation with noise , which describes a compressible fluid .",
    "thus the problem of sliding passive particles on a fluctuating surface maps to the problem of passive scalars in a compressible fluid .",
    "we are interested in characterizing the steady state of this problem , first posed and studied by drossel and kardar in @xcite .",
    "using monte - carlo simulations of a solid on solid model and analyzing the number of particles in a given bin as a function of bin size , they showed that there is clustering of particles .",
    "however their analysis does not involve the scaling with system size , which as we will see below , is one of the most important characteristics of the system .",
    "we find that the two point density - density correlation function is a scaling function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath0 is the separation and @xmath1 is the system size ) and that the scaling function diverges at small @xmath2 .",
    "the divergence indicates formation of clusters while the scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath1 implies that the clusters are typically separated from each other by a distance that scales with the system size .",
    "a brief account of some of our our results has appeared in  @xcite .",
    "+ scaling of the density - density correlation function with system size has also been observed in the related problem of particles with a hard core interaction , sliding under gravity on a kpz surface  @xcite .",
    "however , the correlation function in this case has a cusp singularity as @xmath3 , in contrast to the divergence that we find for noninteracting particles .",
    "thus , while clustering and strong fluctuations are seen in both , the nature of the steady states is different in the two cases . in our case ,",
    "clustering causes a vanishing fraction of sites to be occupied in the noninteracting case , whereas hard core interactions force the occupancy of a finite fraction . in the latter case , there are analogies to customary phase ordered states , with the important difference that there are strong fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit , leading to the appellation fluctuation dominated phase ordering ( fdpo ) states .",
    "the terminology strong clustering states is reserved for the sorts of nonequilibrium states that are found with noninteracting particles  a key feature being the divergent scaling function describing the two point correlation function .",
    "+ in the problem defined above , there are two time scales involved , one associated with the surface evolution and the other with particle motion .",
    "we define @xmath4 as the ratio of the surface to the particle update rates . while we see interesting variations in the characteristics of the system under change of this parameter , the particular limit of @xmath5 is of special importance .",
    "there is a slight subtlety here as the limit @xmath5 does not commute with the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 .",
    "if we consider taking @xmath5 first and then approach large system size ( @xmath6 ) , we obtain a state in which the surface is stationary and the particles move on it under the effect of noise . in this limit of a stationary surface ,",
    "we obtain an equilibrium problem .",
    "this is the well known known sinai model which describes random walkers in a random medium .",
    "we will discuss this limit further below .",
    "now consider taking the large system size limit first and then approach @xmath7 ; this describes a system in which particles move extremely fast compared to the evolution of the local landscape .",
    "this leads to the particles settling quickly into local valleys , and staying there till a new valley evolves .",
    "we thus see a non - equilibrium scs state here , but with the features that the probability of finding a large cluster of particles on a single site is strongly enhanced .",
    "we call this limiting state the extreme - strong clustering state ( escs ) ( fig .",
    "[ omega ] ) . the opposite limit shown in fig .",
    "[ omega ] is the @xmath8 limit where the surface moves much faster than the particles . because of this very fast movement , the particles do not get time to `` feel '' the valleys and they behave as nearly free random walkers .",
    "+ the equilibrium limit ( @xmath5 followed by @xmath6 ) coincides with the sinai model describing random walkers in a random medium  @xcite .",
    "this problem can be analyzed analytically by mapping it to a supersymmetric quantum mechanics problem  @xcite and we are able to obtain closed form answers for the two quantities of interest  the two point correlation function @xmath9 and the probability distribution function of finding @xmath10 particles on a site @xmath11 .",
    "surprisingly , we find that not only do these results show similar scaling behavior as the numerical results for @xmath12 ( nonequilibrium regime ) but also the analytic scaling function describes the numerical data very well .",
    "the only free parameter in this equilibrium problem is the temperature and we choose it to fit our numerical data for the nonequilibrium system .",
    "interestingly , the effective temperature seems to depend on the quantity under study .",
    "+ the kpz equation contains a quadratic term which breaks the up - down symmetry , thus one can have different behavior of the passive scalars depending on whether the surface is moving downwards ( in the direction of the particles , corresponding to advection in fluid language ) or upwards ( against the particles , or anti - advection in fluid language ) . in this paper , we will consider only the case of advection .",
    "one can also consider dropping the nonlinear term itself ; this leads to the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation for surface growth .",
    "the problems of kpz anti - advection and passive sliders on an edwards wilkinson surface are interesting in themselves and will be addressed in a subsequent paper  @xcite . + apart form the static quantities studied above , one can also study the dynamic properties of the system .",
    "bohr and pikovsky  @xcite and chin  @xcite have studied a similar model with the difference that they do not consider noise acting on particles . in the absence of noise , all the particles coalesce and",
    "ultimately form a single cluster in steady state , very different from the strongly fluctuating , distributed particle state under study here .",
    "references  @xcite and  @xcite study the process of coalescence in time .",
    "further , they find that the rms displacement for a given particle increases in time @xmath13 as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is equal to the dynamic exponent of the surface , indicating that the particles have a tendency to follow the valleys of the surface .",
    "drossel and kardar  @xcite have studied the rms displacement in the same problem in the presence of noise and observe the same behavior .",
    "we confirm this result in our simulations and observe that the variation of @xmath4 does not change the result .",

    "the ratio @xmath48 controls the relative time scales of the surface evolution and particle movement .",

    "+ to see how the lattice model described above describes a kpz surface , consider the mapping of the above model to the well known asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) : consider an up slope to be a particle on a lattice and a down slope to be an empty space ( hole ) .",
    "the flipping of a hill to a valley then corresponds to the motion of a particle ( exchange of particle and hole ) . a coarse grained description of the asep leads to the kpz equation  @xcite .",
    "the continuum description of the asep , obtained by coarse graining over regions which are large enough to contain many sites , involves the density of particles @xmath49 and the local current @xmath50 .",

    "@xcite for a slightly different model .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the single step model which we use for monte - carlo simulations , can be mapped on to an asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "the particles / holes in the asep map to the up / down slopes in our model and the flipping of a hill to a valley is equivalent to swapping a particle with a hole . in  @xcite , apart from particles and holes , a third species called the second - class particles are introduced which act as holes for the particles and particles for the holes .",
    "when translated to the surface language , these second class particles behave like the sliders in our model , with the difference that they are not passive : there is no surface evolution at a site where second - class particles reside .",
    "the effect of non - passivity is relatively unimportant for kpz advection - like dynamics of the surface , as particles mostly reside on stable local valleys while surface evolution occurs at local hilltops .",

    "+ the result for @xmath9 also allows us to calculate the quantity @xmath113 first defined in  @xcite ; the lattice is divided into @xmath114 bins of size @xmath115 and we ask for the number @xmath113 of particles in the same bin as a randomly chosen particle .",
    "@xmath113 is a good measure of clustering - if @xmath113 rises linearly with @xmath115 , one concludes that the particles are fairly spread out , while if @xmath113 saturates or shows a decreasing slope , one concludes that particles are clustered .",

    "this clearly indicates that there are large fluctuations in the system which do not damp out in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "large fluctuations , which do not decrease with increasing system size , are also a feature of the fdpo state for particles with a hard core interaction  @xcite .",

    "we choose to call this state as the strong clustering state ( scs ) .",
    "the divergence at origin of the two - point density - density correlation function as function of the separation scaled by the system size , is its hallmark .",
    "the information we get from results on dynamics is that the particles have a tendency to follow the surface .",
    "this is brought out by the fact that the scaling exponent describing the rms displacement comes out to be equal to the dynamic exponent of the kpz surface . +      to see how the system behaves when we change the relative speeds of the surface and particle evolution , we vary the parameter @xmath48 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 being respectively the number of successive surface and particle update attempts ) in the range @xmath162 . when @xmath163 ( particles faster than the surface ) , we regain the scaling form of eq .",

    "when this valley is replaced by another one nearby under surface dynamics , all the particles tend to move to the new one .",
    "if the number of particle updates is greater than surface updates , there is a substantial probability that all the particles are able to move to the new valley before it is itself replaced by another one .",
    "thus there is a significant probability of the initial cluster surviving intact for a fair amount of time .",
    "numerically , we also find that    @xmath164    for @xmath165 , the particles settle down slowly in valleys and @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are respectively the times between successive surface and particle updates .",
    "though @xmath166 ; for large enough @xmath1 , the survival time of the largest valley @xmath169 is always greater than the particle sliding time @xmath170 .",
