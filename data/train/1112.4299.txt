    "the first one is that the su(3 ) symmetry is only approximate as the scattering lengths are different @xcite .",

    ", it is in turn independent of the nuclear spin with a very good approximation . as a consequence",
    ", the interactions between @xmath0yb atoms will have an increased symmetry , su(2 ) @xmath43 su(n ) , at ultracold temperatures @xcite . in ref .",

    "<S> one has to mention graphene , where electrons can be described by a @xmath4-dimensional dirac equation  @xcite ; bilayer @xmath5he , which shows quantum critical behavior  @xcite that resembles heavy fermion materials  @xcite ; atom corals  @xcite where quantum billiards could be simulated ; or cavity quantum electrodynamics where one can study the coupling between light and matter  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ultracold atomic clouds nevertheless have a distinguished place among quantum simulations . during the last two decades , experimental control developed to a high level in the tuning of microscopic parameters and in detection . </S>",
    "<S> ultracold atomic clouds are also very well isolated and free of unwanted perturbations , like disorder , phonons , etc . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the relevant time and length scales are typically larger than in solid - state systems ; therefore the behavior is more tractable experimentally , even in out - of - equilibrium situations .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of experiments with ultracold atomic clouds benefited from the advantages discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the realization of the hubbard model for two fermionic species  @xcite ( highly relevant for high transition temperature superconductivity  @xcite ) , ultracold atomic clouds have been used to study the mott transition for bosons  @xcite and the anderson localization by a disordered potential  @xcite , but also more abstract concepts such as gauge fields  @xcite and black holes  @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we shall investigate how negative absolute temperatures , @xmath3 , in ultracold atomic experiments can grant access to unexplored regions of phase diagrams . after a general discussion , we will focus on two model hamiltonians .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea of negative absolute temperatures is neither complicated nor new @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why @xmath3 is only seldom discussed is that for most physical systems , negative @xmath6 is not possible in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> however , as proposed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , ultracold atomic clouds in optical lattices can exhibit @xmath3 , presenting new possibilities to study correlated quantum systems .    to gain some insight about the @xmath3 regime , and to show connections to the more familiar case of @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the equilibrium partition function of a quantum system , @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the inverse temperature ( we set the boltzmann constant @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is the hamiltonian with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting ( many - body ) eigenstates and the corresponding energies . </S>",
    "<S> there is no principle which forbids @xmath14 in general . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , most physical systems have a spectrum @xmath13 that is bounded from below but has no upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example of such a spectrum is the kinetic energy of free particles , @xmath15 , or for ultracold atoms the trapping potential @xmath16 with confinement @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : z ] ) that without an upper bound in energy , no equilibrium is possible at @xmath14 as the partition function diverges . </S>",
    "<S> although this is the case for the vast majority of physical systems , it is not impossible to construct hamiltonians which have only an _ upper bound _ in energy , where , in turn , only @xmath18 is possible in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we shall below focus on how this can be achieved with ultracold atoms .    from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : z ] ) we can also see that while for @xmath19 the lower energy states have higher occupation probabilities @xmath20 , the opposite , an `` inverse population '' , is realized at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> inverse population of the energy levels leads to an unusual condition in matter , which is most widely used in lasers @xcite .    the most important consequence of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : z ] ) is that the phase diagram of @xmath11 with @xmath14 can be mapped to the phase diagram of a system with @xmath21 described by @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the equivalence that could be used in quantum simulations to chart new parts of phase diagrams experimentally , as we shall discuss later in the context of two models .     with an ultracold atomic cloud in a deep optical lattice.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    </S>",
    "<S> although establishing the correspondence between the hamiltonians @xmath11 and @xmath23 at @xmath19 and @xmath14 is completely trivial theoretically , it represents a major challenge in an experiment since ultracold atomic clouds are always prepared at @xmath7 . in order to achieve negative @xmath6 , one has to follow a certain protocol , as discussed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which we review here in the case of fermions in a deep optical lattice .    from the theoretical aspect , the term which determines the sign of @xmath24 is the external potential characterized by @xmath25 , since the kinetic and interaction terms ( described by the hubbard model ; </S>",
    "<S> see the review by bloch _ _ </S>",
    "<S> e__t al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) are bounded . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the main step is to reverse the external potential @xmath26 and then let the cloud relax . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why the cloud can not explode is energy conservation : the potential energy of the atoms can not be reduced indefinitely as it can only be converted to kinetic and interaction energy of the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since the external potential is not bounded from below , equilibrium at positive temperatures is excluded .    </S>",
    "<S> from the experimental side , the protocol involves the following steps ( see also fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : protocol ] ) : ( 1 )  load the cloud to an optical lattice in an ( insulating ) state at @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; ( 2 )  increase the height of the optical lattice suddenly to `` freeze '' the density distributions ; ( 3 )  reverse the sign of the external potential @xmath26 ( and possibly adjust other control parameters , as well ) ; ( 4 )  suddenly reduce the height of the optical lattice ; and ( 5 )  wait for the cloud to relax . according to the boltzmann simulation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the cloud should be close to an equilibrium state with @xmath29 within the typical experimental time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol works optimally when the initial state is an insulator , somewhat restricting the final parameters . to access a more extended region of the phase diagram , one should change the couplings quasi - adiabatically after step 5 .    although the dynamics restricted by the principle of energy conservation can lead to @xmath29 in a reversed parabolic potential , the final state could be too hot : the interesting correlated phases typically found in the low - temperature regime might not be accessed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the main source of heating is that the protocol is inescapably non - adiabatic . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is important to discuss which are the suitable conditions and estimate how much entropy is generated . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal parameters depend on the details of the specific system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we focus on two , rather different but theoretically important models to show how simulations could benefit from applying @xmath29 . </S>"
