    "there are more than 200 photometric systems that have been used in astronomy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the amount of information about a star that can be extracted from photometry is highly dependent on the choice of photometric filters .",
    "early on , strmgren introduced the @xmath0 system with the aim of characterizing the main stellar atmospheric parameters and reddening @xcite .",
    "strmgren s filters have widths of the order of 200  , and are thus considered intermediate - band . other systems with similar and narrower passbands have been introduced since , but most photometric systems use filters significantly broader than stromgren s , and therefore tend to provide lower sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters .    until recently , the most widely - used photometric system was the broad - band johnson - cousins @xmath1 , but with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which includes ccd - based photometry for 357 million unique optical sources over more than 11,000 square degrees @xcite , and 2mass @xcite , which includes nearly half a million near - ir sources over the entire sky , these new systems have taken over .",
    "the hegemony of the sdss system in the optical is illustrated by the fact that new and future instruments , such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , the dark energy survey ( des ) camera , or osiris @xcite on the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) are adopting the same system .    despite",
    "the widths of the sdss filters are 36 times larger than the strmgren passbands , @xcite have shown that , if the reddening is known with sufficient accuracy , it is possible to estimate stellar effective temperatures for late - type stars with a typical precision of @xmath2 k , and metallicities with a precision of @xmath3 dex from sdss photometry alone for stars of moderate metallicities .",
    "the sensitivity of sdss photometry to surface gravity is much weaker , and disentangling this parameter from the other two , even in the absence of reddening , may not be possible , but in any case we are not aware of any sucessful calibration .",
    "because of the vast number of sources with available sdss photometry , it is desirable to ensure that we are extracting all possible information captured by this system . the most straightforward techniques for mapping photometric indices into the quantities of interest , such as stellar atmospheric parameters , have provided limited success , and the time is ripe to explore new avenues .",
    "this work examines the possibility of using a simple technique inspired on the concept of compressed sensing ( cs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to reconstruct spectroscopic data of stellar objects from sdss photometry .",
    "if there is an accessible mapping between photometry and intermediate - dispersion spectra , the available tools for spectroscopic analysis could then be applied to the reconstructed spectra in order to recover the parameters of interest .",
    "the recent work on sdss spectra by @xcite indicates that for stars in narrow color bands ( about 0.02 mag wide in @xmath4 ) , principal component analysis ( pca ) can be applied , and most of the variance in the spectra is recovered with just 4 principal components .",
    "this result strongly suggests that the sdss intermediate - resolution spectra are highly sparse , and the most relevant information in the data can be compressed into just four numbers .",
    "this statement should be accompanied by a warning : sdss spectra typically have a modest signal - to - noise ratio ( most sdss spectra are for stars in the range @xmath5 and have typical signal - to - noise ratios at 500 nm between 65 and 8) .",
    "we also note that @xcite used the median difference between the original and reconstructed spectra to quantify the level of agreement .",
    "hence , significantly larger differences between the original and the spectra recovered with four components are expected for a small fraction of their sample , as we show in this paper .",
    "if the spectra are indeed sparse , there is a good chance that photometry alone can be used to reconstruct them to some precision ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for similar applications ) . in this paper",
    ", we explore this possibility in detail , in particular for the case when sdss stellar spectra can be represented as a linear combination of a small number of vectors , as concluded by @xcite .",
    "section 2 describes the basic concept and develops the mathematical method .",
    "section 3 applies the method to sdss spectra and photometry .",
    "section 4 discusses the error propagation from the photometry to the reconstructed spectra , and section 5 summarizes our findings .",
    "during the last few years , the emerging theory of compressed sensing is showing that the nyquist - shannon sampling theorem is too restrictive in case some details of the signal structure are known in advance .",
    "the interesting point of the new cs paradigm is that , in many instances , natural signals have a structure that is known in advance .",
    "the key point is that , typically , only few elements of the basis set in which we develop the signal are necessary for an accurate description of the important physical information . instead of measuring the full signal ( wavelength variation of the stellar spectrum in our case ) , under the cs framework one",
    "measures a few linear projections of the signal along some vectors known in advance and reconstructs the signal solving a non - linear problem .",
    "explicity , let @xmath6 be a vector of length @xmath7 that represents the sampled wavelength variation of the stellar spectrum . a standard spectrograph measures the spectrum by accumulating photons in wavelength bins determined by the spectral resolution . instead",
    ", we propose to measure scalar products of the signal with carefully selected vectors ( multiplex measurements ) , so that : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vector of measurements of dimension @xmath10 , @xmath11 is an @xmath12 sensing matrix that we particularize below and @xmath13 is a vector of dimension @xmath10 that characterizes the noise on the measurement process . note that the previous equation describes the most general linear multiplexing scheme in which the number of measurements @xmath10 and the length of the signal @xmath7 may differ . in the most standard multiplexing situation , the number of scalar products measured equals the dimension of the signal ( @xmath14 ) and it is possible to recover the vector @xmath6 provided that @xmath15 ( in other words , that every row of the @xmath11 matrix is orthogonal with respect to every other row ) .    our aim , though ,",
    "is to solve the previous linear system ( i.e. , obtain the spectrum @xmath6 ) from the smallest possible number of measurements @xmath9 . in general , this can be accomplished by solving the linear system using the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the @xmath11 matrix ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the solution through the svd fulfills that it is the one producing the smallest @xmath16-norm - norm of a vector is given by @xmath17 if @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 pseudo - norm is given by the number of non - zero elements of @xmath20 .",
    "] of the residuals , or equivalently , the least - squares solution . when @xmath21 , this solution is strongly affected by noise and is practically useless in general",
    "however , this problem can be overcome if the ingredient of sparsity is invoked .",
    "the success of cs techniques is fundamentally based on the idea that , if the signal of interest is sparse in a certain basis set ( or can be efficiently compressed in this basis set ) , the reconstruction is made possible",
    ". any compressible signal can be written , in general , in the following way : @xmath22 where now @xmath23 is a @xmath24-sparse - sparse if only @xmath24 elements of the vector are different from zero . ] vector of size @xmath7 and @xmath25 is the transpose of an @xmath26 transformation matrix associated with the basis set in which the signal is sparse .",
    "for instance , @xmath27 can be the fourier matrix if the signal @xmath6 is the combination of a few sinusoidal components . in our case",
    ", we will use the transformation matrix associated with the principal components .",
    "the combination of the previous two ingredients leads to the following multiplexing scheme : @xmath28 with the hypothesis that @xmath23 is sparse , i.e. , that the @xmath19-norm of @xmath23 is as small as possible .",
    "principal component analysis ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been applied to sdss data with the aim of classification , noise - reduction and compression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for different types of objects .",
    "the principal components ( eigenvectors of the correlation / covariance matrix of the database ) represent a complete basis set for a given database of spectra .",
    "one of the advantages of the pca decomposition is that the importance of an eigenvector ( measured as the associated absolute value of the eigenvalue ) decays typically like a power - law .",
    "therefore , if one considers that only @xmath7 principal components contribute significantly to the reconstruction of a spectrum , it can be seen that the vector @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis_decomposition ] ) is non - zero only in the first @xmath7 elements , and approximately zero in the rest . additionally , the matrix @xmath25 is built from the principal components ordered from the absolute value of their associated eigenvalues as columns .",
    "recently , @xcite have applied pca to sdss stellar spectra .",
    "they have analyzed a subset of the full spectral database of sdss and calculated the principal components separately for stars in intervals of 0.02 mag in the @xmath4 color .",
    "the range of colors considered spans @xmath29 , corresponding to mk spectral types a3 to k3 .",
    "according to @xcite , this segregation in @xmath4 color is roughly equivalent to a segregation in effective temperature due to the large correlation between this parameter and the @xmath4 color .",
    "it is also of interest to point out that the effect of reddening is limited by selecting stars with an estimated extinction below 0.3 mag in the @xmath30 band .",
    "thanks to the binning , the number of principal components needed in each interval to reach noise level is highly reduced .",
    "they demonstrate that the mean spectrum plus three principal components ( hereafter referred to as the first four principal components ) are more than enough to statistically reconstruct the stellar spectra at the noise level .    as a caveat ,",
    "note that the quality of the principal component decomposition of @xcite is only measured through the median difference .",
    "it is then expected that @xmath3150% of the stars in each bin have a decomposition that reproduce the spectra with a difference larger than the noise level ( see  [ sec : reconstruction ] ) .",
    "if a different binning is proposed in the future leading to new ( hopefully improved ) principal components , our reconstruction scheme remains unchanged and can be computed using exactly the same observations .",
    "thankfully , the segregation of @xcite is done using an observed quantity and the bin can be known just using photometric data .",
    "we take this highly efficient pca decomposition for reconstructing sdss stellar spectra from photometric measurements .",
    "in addition to the sparsity condition , the other important ingredient of our technique relies on the election of the sensing matrix .",
    "this matrix is the one that relates the underlying spectrum with the measurements we use in the reconstruction .",
    "our aim is to test whether photometric data can be used to reconstruct spectra , so that the sensing matrix is not a choice , but given by the weighting functions of the sdss filter set .",
    "figure [ fig : sensing_matrix ] shows the @xmath32 filter set and an example of an observed spectrum .",
    "note that filters @xmath33 and @xmath34 have important contributions outside the observed spectral range .",
    "consequently , the information they contain can not be easily utilized under the scheme presented in this paper and we carry out the reconstructions using only filters @xmath35 , @xmath30 and @xmath36 .    obtaining the magnitude in the filter @xmath37 of the sdss system from spectroscopic data reduces to the calculation of the following quantity @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the flux distribution of the star .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 is the effective transmissivity of the filter , including the filter response , the ccd quantum efficiency and the typical transmission of the sky for a point source ( in our cases adopted for an airmass of 1.3 ) .",
    "the flux measured for each filter can be estimated using the riemann integral as ( note that more precise quadrature rules can be used without a significant change in the following discussion ) : @xmath41 where we have made the integration in the wavelength axis and used @xmath42 instead of @xmath39 since the principal components of @xcite are given in terms of @xmath42 .",
    "the normalization constant for each filter is obtained likewise : @xmath43    note that one is able to isolate the flux from the observed magnitudes as : @xmath44 consequently , the flux associated to the measured photometric quantity can be written as the dot product of the original flux distribution @xmath45 and a weighting function , so that each column of the sensing matrix @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sensing ] ) is given by : @xmath46      the sparsity constraint of the spectrum is fulfilled automatically when using a principal component decomposition , with the additional advantage of knowing exactly which coefficients of the sparse vector @xmath23 are non - zero .",
    "therefore , the solution of the problem given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sensing2 ] ) is simpler than the full cs problem in which the non - zero elements of @xmath23 have to be identified .",
    "consequently , the solution to eq .",

    "<S> this process may facilitate the extraction of purely spectroscopic quantities , such as the overall metallicity , for hundreds of millions of stars for which only photometric information is available , using standard techniques applied to the reconstructed spectra . </S>"
