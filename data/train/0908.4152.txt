    "results of parsec - scale very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) measurements were not applied by @xcite in the process of identifying bright lat sources . however",
    ", this can provide important extra information and improve the estimation of the probability of correct identification since vlbi filters out objects which do not host strong compact jets at parsec scales .",
    "the latter is a strong characteristic of a radio loud blazar .",
    "vlbi can especially help in the region around the galactic plane where the available multi - band coverage of the sky is much poorer due to galactic absorption .",
    "an obvious weakness of the vlbi approach is the fact that radio weak objects ( e.g. , high energy selected bl  lacs ) are missed in the currently available large vlbi all  sky surveys .    during the last several decades",

    "we note that while the majority of those are of a blazar type , @xcite have found 10  per  cent of compact extragalactic radio sources to be optically associated with galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey . in this paper",
    "we use the 2/8  ghz vlbi surveys to associate the early _ fermi _  lat bright source list with radio counterparts at parsec scales , make a statistical check on the reliability of these identifications , and analyze the radio properties of the vlbi counterparts of the @xmath0-ray bright agn .",
    "the vlbi positions for more than 4,000 extragalactic sources covering the whole sky were used in this analysis .",
    "they are based on 2 and 8  ghz vlbi observations , most of which were performed in the period 1994 to 2007 @xcite .",

    "they concluded that the related @xmath0-ray and parsec - scale radio emission should originate in spatially close regions .",

    "we kept the _ fermi _  lbs catalog unchanged while the vlbi catalog was scrambled ; every source in the vlbi catalog was shifted in a random position angle for a random angular distance on the sky between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "after that , cross - identification of the catalogs was done as described above .",
    "this exercise was performed 1,000 times .",
    "the analysis was done independently for the lbs versus avs and lbs versus fvs lists .",
    "the mean number of chance associations was found to be 4.5 ( 4.1  per  cent of 111 true identifications , see ",
    "[ s : res_ass ] ) and 2.9 ( 3.7  per  cent of 79 identifications ) respectively .",
    "this shows with a very high level of significance that ( _ i _ ) almost all of the associations found are firm identifications , ( _ ii _ ) the original assumption of the method that the @xmath0-ray sky is dominated by blazars with strong parsec - scale jets is confirmed .",
    "the described above method of vlbi catalog scrambling was applied to represent the non - uniformity of the avs list , where sky regions of a special interest ( e.g. , the galactic plane ) are populated more densely .",
    "the @xmath23-radius was chosen as an optimal size to represent the non - uniformity being in the same time significantly greater than the @xmath8 values .",
    "we note that , for a uniform sky coverage in an original catalog , this method reproduces uniformity in the monte - carlo test .",
    "if we consider as a match _ fermi _  and vlbi sources with positional difference less than @xmath24 , we lose about 30  per  cent of identifications ( see figures  [ f : tsr95dp],[f : histdp ] ) while the chance coincidence probability drops only down to about 2  per  cent .",
    "we have performed a correlation analysis between the average _ fermi _  lat 100  mev  1  gev photon flux @xcite versus 8  ghz parsec - scale flux density measured by vlbi between 1994 and 2008 ( figure  [ f : sgr ] ) .",
    "the non - parametric kendall @xmath25 test confirms a positive correlation in figure  [ f : sgr ] at a confidence level greater than @xmath26  per  cent for the 100  mev  1  gev energy band ( the two upper limits were ignored by the test which did not affect the conclusion ) .",
    "this agrees with results of a similar analysis performed by @xcite for simultaneous lat @xmath0-ray  15  ghz vlba mojave @xcite measurements .",
    "possible systematics in this dependence resulting from the different properties of two populations of extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources ( low energy peaked versus high energy peaked ) were mentioned by @xcite .",
    "we do not go into detailed analysis of this in the present paper since @xcite have addressed this issue in their study .",
    "an even stronger test is done by analyzing the full fvs sample of 1848 sources which is complete down to 0.2  jy , separating them into lat detected and lat non - detected ( figure  [ f : flux_vcsx ] ) .",
    "we assume that lat non - detected objects have statistically lower @xmath0-ray photon flux and therefore should have lower radio flux .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test shows with a confidence greater that 99.99  per  cent that the distributions of the parsec - scale flux density for the lat detected and non - detected vlbi sources are drawn from different parent distributions .",
    "the median flux densities of these two distributions differ by a factor of 2.5 : 0.84  jy versus 0.34  jy .",
    "this strongly supports the correlation between @xmath0-ray and parsec - scale radio emission , confirming again the recent finding by @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that vlbi provides a very efficient tool to identify bright @xmath0-ray detections which have poor positional accuracy .",
    "application of this method is especially important for _ fermi _  lat identifications near the galactic plane where vlbi observations are affected by absorption and extended galactic emission to a much lesser degree than other radio observations .",
    "it is suggested that this method be incorporated into the process of identification of the _ fermi _  lat catalogs and for estimation of systematics in @xmath0-ray positions .",
    "the results of @xmath0-ray source identification by @xcite have been confirmed .",
    "six new identifications are reported for a follow  up analysis , all within @xmath21 from the galactic plane .",
    "it is estimated that more than 95  per  cent of the vlbi associations found are firm identifications .",
    "direct cross - correlation of the _ fermi _  lat and vlbi catalogs has confirmed with a very high level of significance the early finding of egret @xcite and _ fermi _  @xcite that most of the bright @xmath0-ray sources on the sky are compact blazars .",
    "it was found that _",
    "lat preferentially `` selects '' the brightest objects from a flux - density - limited sample of radio loud parsec - scale jets which supports the hypothesis of a direct correlation and physical connection between emission in the @xmath0-ray and radio bands .",
