    "this higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value @xmath5  gev , @xmath6 being the fermi constant , which breaks the su(2)@xmath7u(1)@xmath8 symmetry at high energies down to the electric u(1)@xmath9 below the symmetry breaking scale and leads to nonzero masses of the elementary particles .",
    "the higgs mechanism also predicts that the higgs fields can be produced as a massive bose particle in collider experiments if sufficient energy is provided in the process .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is expected to lie between the current experimental lower limit of @xmath10  gev  @xcite and about 1  tev .",
    "current analyses of electroweak precision observables yield a @xmath11  cl upper indirect bound of @xmath12  gev for the higgs boson mass  @xcite . while a higgs boson with a mass up to @xmath13  tev can be found at the lhc , precise and model - independent measurements of quantum numbers and couplings are likely to be restricted to a future @xmath14 linear collider  @xcite such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) project .",
    "the higgs mechanism predicts that the quark masses @xmath15 are related to the quark - higgs yukawa coupling @xmath16 through the relation @xmath17 .",
    "this makes the measurement of the yukawa coupling to the top quark ( @xmath18  gev  @xcite ) particularly important since it is expected to have a high precision . at a future @xmath14 linear collider",
    "the top yukawa coupling can be measured from the process @xmath19 since the amplitudes describing higgs radiation off the @xmath2 pair dominate the cross section .",

    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the summation of the singular terms leads to an enhancement of the total cross section that needs to be accounted for up to c.m.energies of about @xmath35  gev .",
    "the impact of the summations increases with the fraction of the phase space where the c.m.top velocity @xmath31 is nonrelativistic , i.e. it increases with the higgs and top quark masses and decreases with the c.m .",
    "a convenient measure for the impact of the nonrelativistic summations on the total cross section is the maximal relative velocity of the @xmath2 pair which is achieved at the _ low _ higgs energy endpoint @xmath36 , @xmath37 for small @xmath38 the summations have a large effect since the available phase space is predominantly nonrelativistic .    as was already demonstrated in ref .",
