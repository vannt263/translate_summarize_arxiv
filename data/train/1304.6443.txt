    "most of the elements in the mass range 60 @xmath17 a @xmath17 90 that we observe today in the solar system are produced by neutron capture on iron seed nuclei , mainly during the convective core helium and convective shell carbon phases in massive stars ( weak @xmath4 process ) @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the weak @xmath4 process depends on the network of nuclear reactions used for stellar calculations , above all on the main neutron source @xmath18ne@xmath19 mg and on its main competing reaction @xmath18ne@xmath20 mg , and on the set of neutron capture cross sections used in the energy range of he and c burning ( 0.25 @xmath21 t @xmath21 1.5 gk ) @xcite .",
    "since the rate of neutron captures is slow compared to the decay rate of unstable reaction products , in the @xmath4 process the neutron capture path follows the valley of stability .",
    "the final @xmath4 process abundances depend on the total amount of neutrons available integrated over time ( or neutron exposure )  @xcite , the history of the neutron density in the stellar regions where the @xmath4 process occurs , and on the initial stellar metallicity .",
    "light isotopes , depending on their abundance and neutron capture cross sections , can capture a large amount of free neutrons , thereby acting as neutron poisons in the burning environment .    the main neutron source for the @xmath4 process in massive stars is the @xmath18ne@xmath19 mg reaction . it is activated mostly at the end of the convective core he burning @xcite and in the convective carbon shell , on ashes of previous he core burning @xcite . the abundance of @xmath18ne is given by the initial cno abundances , where @xmath22n produced via h burning in the cno cycle forms @xmath18ne by capturing two @xmath23-particles in the initial he burning phases ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath4 process in massive stars is a secondary process because of its dependence on the initial metallicity , the @xmath18ne abundance , on the iron seeds and on the effect of light neutron poisons .",
    "because the efficiency and yields of the @xmath4 process decrease linearly with the initial metal content for massive stars with lower metallicities @xcite , the @xmath4 process contribution to galactic chemical evolution from massive stars becomes marginal at low metallicity .",
    "however , recent observations ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) show a puzzling enhancement of light @xmath4 process elements in very low metallicity stars .",
    "recent theoretical studies have shown that fast rotating massive stars may potentially have @xmath4 process yields orders of magnitude higher than non - rotating stars  @xcite . in this case",
    "primary @xmath18ne is produced in the convective he core , independently from the initial metallicity of the star .",
    "as a result , fast rotator yields could be relevant for the chemical evolution of heavy @xmath4 process elements .",

    "@xmath3o is the most abundant species in regions processed by advanced he burning via the @xmath26c@xmath27o reaction . because of its high abundance @xmath3o is the strongest neutron absorber , despite the low @xmath3o@xmath25o cross section @xcite .",
    "the present large uncertainties of the @xmath0o+@xmath23 rates ( together with other relevant rates , e.  g. , @xmath18ne+@xmath23  @xcite ) affects the theoretical @xmath4 process predictions of fast rotating massive stars at low metallicity  @xcite .    the neutron source @xmath18ne@xmath19 mg is activated in massive stars at stellar temperatures of typically t @xmath28 0.25    0.3 and t @xmath28 1  gk , during convective core he burning and convective shell c burning , respectively . for the reaction @xmath0o@xmath29 , center - of - mass energies of around 0.5  mev and 1.1  mev are therefore most important .",

    "its reliability is uncertain due to a strong background contribution from the @xmath30o@xmath31ne channel , as well as the inability of the experimental setup to discriminate between the n@xmath32 and n@xmath33 channels , leading to ambiguities in the detector efficiency determination .    to overcome these problems we remeasured the total yield of the reaction",

    "the @xmath23-beam was provided by the 4  mv kn accelerator at the university of notre dame nuclear science laboratory .",
    "energy calibration and resolution ( 1.1  kev ) were determined using the well - known resonances e@xmath39  kev and e@xmath40  kev in @xmath41al@xmath42si @xcite .",
    "the beam energy was reproducible within @xmath43  kev between different hysteresis cycles of the analyzing magnet during the course of the experiment .",
    "targets were prepared by anodization of 0.3 mm thick tantalum backings using h@xmath44o enriched to 90.1% in @xmath0o .",
    "this process is known to produce homogeneous films of ta@xmath44o@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the film thickness can be controlled in a reproducible way through regulation of the maximal anodization voltage .",
    "the target thickness was chosen to be about 9  kev of energy loss for an @xmath23 beam of 1000  kev and a target orientation of @xmath46 with respect to the beam direction .    to reduce carbon deposition a liquid nitrogen cooled copper tube ( cold finger )",
    "was mounted in front of the target .",
    "a bias of -400 v was applied to the cold finger for suppression of secondary electrons .",
    "the beam was scanned with magnetic steerers to produce a beam spot size of 1.4 cm @xmath47 1.6 cm on the target . in both parts of the experiment",
    "the target chamber was electrically isolated for charge collection and the targets were directly water cooled using deionized water .          for this part of the measurement a ge detector with a relative efficiency of 20% was placed at a distance of 5.4 cm from the target at an angle of @xmath49 with respect to the beam direction . in order to minimize radiation damage to the detector a 2.5 cm polyethylene disk was attached to the detector front cap .",
    "this reduced significantly the neutron flux in the detector .",
    "the transition from the first excited state to the ground state of @xmath37ne emits a @xmath10 ray with an energy of e@xmath50  kev @xcite .",
    "absolute efficiencies were established with calibrated @xmath51cs , @xmath52co and @xmath53ba sources and augmented using relative efficiency data from @xmath54co .",
    "there was enough absorbing material between source and detector ( 0.25 mm tantalum backing , 1 mm brass target holder and the 2.5 cm thick polyethylene disk ) to attenuate the low - energy photons emitted by the ba source ( e@xmath55  kev and e@xmath56  kev ) by approximately 98% , resulting in negligible summing effects in the ba measurements .",
    "summing corrections for the @xmath57co measurements amounted to less than 2% .",
    "the resulting efficiency curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1_eff ] .",
    "this part of the experiment was dedicated to the measurement of the @xmath0o@xmath34ne reaction by direct detection of the reaction neutrons .",
    "the detector consisted of 20 @xmath59he counters that were embedded in an arrangement of two concentric rings with diameter 6  cm and 11  cm , respectively into a 30 cm @xmath47 30 cm @xmath47 33 cm polyethylene moderator .",
    "the very high cross section of the reaction @xmath59he(n , p)@xmath59h ( q = 764  kev , @xmath60 barn ) for thermal neutron capture and its low sensitivity to photons make it an excellent neutron detector , although due to the thermalization in the polyethylene moderator the information on the neutron energy is mostly lost .",
    "additional shielding from background neutrons was provided by a 5 cm thick layer of borated polyethylene on the outside of the moderator . at the beginning of each experimental run",
    "the detector was centered around the target chamber by monitoring the neutron yield as a function of distance of the detector to the target holder .",

    "the absolute detector efficiency was determined using the reaction @xmath61v(p , n)@xmath61cr @xcite .",
    "this reaction with a neutron threshold of 1565  kev is known to produce mono - energetic neutrons that are approximately isotropic in the center - of - mass system .",
    "the thickness of the vanadium targets was about 30 @xmath62 , corresponding to a proton energy loss between 2.5 and 3 kev in the covered energy range .",
    "although a large number of narrow resonances has been observed in this reaction no pronounced angular distributions have been reported in the literature @xcite . since our data show a smooth behaviour , in agreement with similar calibration measurements using @xmath63v@xmath64cr @xcite , we believe it to be unaffected by any possible angular anisotropies .",
    "the reaction product @xmath61cr decays to the first excited state in @xmath61v by electron capture and subsequent emission of a characteristic e@xmath65  kev photon with a half - life of t@xmath66 d and a branching probability of 9.9 % @xcite .",
    "the activity and therefore the number of produced @xmath61cr nuclei was determined by counting the emitted @xmath10-rays using a pb - cu shielded counting station at notre dame . in this way",
    "the neutron detection efficiency of the detector was established with high accuracy without having to rely on cross section data .",
    "the experimental uncertainty is dominated by the efficiency determination of the ge detector ( 2% ) introduced by the uncertainty in the source activity and errors due to the activation procedure . to obtain sufficient @xmath63v activity it was necessary to run with large beam currents for which the count rate in the neutron detector was too high .",
    "therefore , the number of generated neutrons per accumulated charge had to be determined during several short runs with reduced beam current .",
    "this number was then used to scale the higher - current activation runs .",
    "we estimate the error resulting from this procedure to be @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting total error of the activation measurement is 5.4% .",
    "the @xmath63v activations were carried out at proton energies between 1600  kev to 2200  kev resulting in calibration points for neutron energies between 50  kev and 650  kev .",
    "in addition to measurements geant4 @xcite and mcnp @xcite simulations of the setup were used to determine the energy dependence of the efficiency towards higher neutron energies that were inaccessible to direct measurements @xcite .",

    "<S> background : :    the ratio between the rates of the reactions    @xmath0o@xmath1ne and    @xmath0o@xmath2ne determines    whether @xmath3o is an efficient neutron poison for the    @xmath4 process in massive stars , or if most of the neutrons    captured by @xmath3o@xmath5 are recycled    into the stellar environment . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is of particular relevance to    constrain the @xmath4 process yields of fast rotating massive    stars at low metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    recent results on the @xmath6 channel have made    it necessary to measure the @xmath7 reaction more    precisely and investigate the effect of the new data on    @xmath4 process nucleosynthesis in massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    the @xmath0o@xmath8 reaction has    been measured with a moderating neutron detector . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the    @xmath9 channel has been measured independently    by observation of the characteristic 1633  kev    @xmath10-transition in @xmath11ne . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction    cross section was determined with a simultaneous _ r_-matrix fit to    both channels . @xmath7 and    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 resonance strengths of states lying    below the covered energy range were estimated using their known    properties from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the reaction channels    @xmath0o@xmath13ne and    @xmath0o@xmath14ne were    measured in the energy range e@xmath15  kev to    2300  kev . </S>",
    "<S> a new @xmath0o@xmath7 reaction    rate was deduced for the temperature range 0.1  gk to 10  gk . at typical    he burning temperatures , the combination of the new    @xmath7 rate with a previously measured    @xmath6 rate gives approximately the same ratio    as current compilations . </S>",
    "<S> the influence on the nucleosynthesis of the    @xmath4 process in massive stars at low metallicity is    discussed . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    it was found that in he burning conditions the    @xmath6 channel is strong enough to compete with    the neutron channel . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a less efficient neutron recycling    compared to a previous suggestion of a very weak    @xmath6 channel . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 process    calculations using our rates confirm that massive rotating stars do    play a significant role in the production of elements up to sr , but    they strongly reduce the @xmath4 process contribution to    heavier elements . </S>"
