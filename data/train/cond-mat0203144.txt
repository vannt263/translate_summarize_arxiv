    "effective potentials are a key to unlocking the equilibrium behavior of many soft - matter systems@xcite .",
    "the basic philosophy behind this coarse - graining approach is that the initial effort in deriving these potentials is recouped when they are input into the well oiled machinery of liquid state theory@xcite , or when they are used in computer simulations@xcite .",
    "an archetypal example is the depletion potential , induced between colloidal particles by non - adsorbing polymers .",
    "asakura and oosawa@xcite first showed that a bath of such polymers , characterized by their radius of gyration @xmath0 , induces an attractive depletion interaction of range @xmath1 between two plates .",
    "their calculation was exact for non - interacting polymers .",
    "later , the same authors , and independently vrij@xcite , derived a depletion potential between two colloidal hard spheres ( hs ) by approximating the ( ideal ) polymers as penetrable spheres .",
    "this is often termed the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model .",
    "a good example of the effective potential coarse - graining approach is the calculation of the phase behavior of polymer - colloid mixtures by gast , hall , and russel@xcite , and also by lekkerkerker _",
    "et al._@xcite and meijer and frenkel@xcite",
    ". they found , using an ao depletion potential approach , that the fluid - fluid phase line of colloids of radius @xmath2 becomes metastable w.r.t .  the fluid - solid phase line if the size ratio @xmath3 is less than about @xmath4 , in qualitative agreement with experiments@xcite .",
    "their work demonstrates how an accurate knowledge of the depletion potential can lead to a good understanding of the equilibrium behavior of colloid polymer mixtures .",
    "the latter are important not only because of their relevance to many industrial and biological processes , but also because they form an important model system for equilibrium and non - equilibrium behavior in soft matter science .    whereas the depletion interaction for ideal polymers is now quantitatively understood ,",
    "the depletion interaction induced by polymers with excluded volume interactions is only qualitatively understood .",
    "experiments on the phase behavior@xcite and structure@xcite of polymer colloid mixtures also show deviations from the simple ao model@xcite , as do direct measurements of the depletion potentials@xcite .",
    "theoretical attempts to directly calculate the depletion potentials for interacting polymers include scaling theory@xcite , self - consistent field theory@xcite , perturbation theory@xcite , direct simulations@xcite , rg theory@xcite , as well an interesting new `` overlap approximation '' method@xcite .",
    "all these approaches show significant deviations from ideal polymer behavior , but many questions still remain .",
    "this is in contrast to binary hs colloid mixtures , where the deviations from the ao potential can now be quantitatively calculated with density functional theory ( dft)@xcite , and the effects of non - ideality on the phase behavior are fairly well understood@xcite .",
    "the goal of our paper is to derive a theory of similar accuracy for the depletion potential induced by interacting polymers in a good solvent    before we proceed , an important caveat is that the depletion potential becomes less relevant for phase behavior at larger size ratios @xmath5 , since many - body interactions become increasingly important@xcite .",
    "when @xmath6 , i.e.  when the colloids are much smaller than the polymers , other approaches , which treat the polymers on a monomer level , are more relevant .",
    "examples include integral equation techniques@xcite , scaling theory@xcite , or renormalization group theory ( rg)@xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the regime where @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath2 or smaller .",
    "we have recently performed a systematic study of the insertion free - energy of a single colloidal particle in a bath of interacting polymers@xcite ( henceforth referred to as paper i ) , and found important deviations from ideal polymer behavior . in particular",
    ", we found that the range of the depletion layer decreases with increasing density @xmath7 , and that this effect is most pronounced in the dilute regime , where @xmath8 ; here @xmath9 is the overlap density . in the semi - dilute regime , where @xmath10 , we found that the effects of the interactions could be well described by scaling theory@xcite . since these one - body effects were not well captured by ( non - additive ) hs like models , we do not expect straightforward extensions of the dft techniques that work so well for binary hard hs mixtures , to also perform well for two - body depletion potentials in polymer - colloid mixtures .    to calculate the depletion potentials",
    ", we use a similar approach to that used in paper i  a combination of scaling theories and computer simulations .",
    "since we found in paper i that the range of the depletion layer decreases with increasing density , we expect a similar trend for the range of the related depletion potential . throughout this work we focus on the dilute and semi - dilute regimes@xcite of the polymers , where the monomer density @xmath11 is low enough for detailed monomer - monomer correlations to be unimportant ; the melt regime , where @xmath11 becomes appreciable ,",
    "will not be treated here . since our models",
    "are all athermal , we set @xmath12 .    the paper is organized as follows : the case of the depletion interaction between two plates is discussed in detail in section ii .",
    "we show that it is closely related to the problem of determining the surface tension @xmath13 , which was solved in paper i. just as was found for @xmath13 , the depletion potential simplifies in the semi - dilute regime . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the depletion interaction between two spheres .",
    "we compare the results of direct monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the interaction between two hs colloids induced by a bath of self avoiding walk ( saw ) polymers to a potential derived within the derjaguin approximation@xcite .",
    "the derjaguin approximation works much better than one would naively expect because of a cancellation of errors related to the deformation of polymers around a sphere . using an extension of the derjaguin approximation",
    ", we derive a new semi - empirical depletion potential which appears to be nearly quantitative for @xmath14 , the regime where depletion potentials are most relevant for the phase behavior and structure of polymer - colloid mixtures .",
    "we derive the scaling behavior with density , and find important deviations from the ao model and other ideal - polymer theories .",
    "we also calculate the depletion potential between spheres within our new `` polymers as soft colloids '' coarse - graining scheme@xcite , where each polymer is represented by a single particle , interacting via a density - dependent effective potential . here",
    "we again find good agreement with the direct mc results for the dilute regime , but for @xmath15 , significant deviations are found . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the effect of polymer density on the virial coefficients between two colloids , and relate this to phase behavior of polymer - colloid mixtures .",
    "immersing a single hard wall ( or plate ) into a bath of non - adsorbing polymers in a good solvent reduces the number of configurations available for the polymers .",
    "this in turn results in an entropically induced depletion layer @xmath16 near the wall , discussed in more detail , for example , in paper i. associated with the creation of this depletion layer is an interfacial free energy cost per unit area @xmath17 , i.e.  a wall - fluid surface tension @xmath13 , which typically depends on the bulk density @xmath7 , or equivalently the bulk chemical potential @xmath18@xcite .",
    "bringing two such walls , of area @xmath17 , together from an infinite distance apart to a distance @xmath19 where the two depletion layers begin to overlap , changes the total free energy of the polymer solution .",
    "this change in the free energy or grand potential @xmath20 per unit area is called the depletion potential @xmath21@xcite . when @xmath22 , i.e.  when the two walls are brought into contact , the depletion potential reduces to the simple form @xmath23 reflecting the fact that the two depletion layers are completely destroyed .    in paper",
    "i , we used an extension of the gibbs adsorption equation to express the surface tension near a single wall as @xmath24 the derivation of this equation can be found , for example , in@xcite . here @xmath25 is the osmotic pressure of the polymer solution , and @xmath26 is the reduced adsorption near a single wall , defined as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the excess grand potential per unit area . in paper",
    "i , we used computer simulations of a saw polymer solution in a good solvent near a wall to calculate @xmath16 and @xmath26 for several values of @xmath29 .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the saw on a cubic lattice is a very good model for polymers in a good solvent . in the scaling limit , where the length @xmath30 tends towards @xmath31 ,",
    "its properties are universal , and agree with experiments on polymers in the same good solvent regime@xcite .",
    "for example , the radius of gyration scales as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the flory exponent , taken to be @xmath34 in this paper . by using an accurate fitting form which takes into account the correct scaling behavior , we expressed @xmath26 for all densities in the dilute and semi - dilute regimes . when this was combined with an rg expression for the pressure",
    ", we were able to calculate the surface tension @xmath13 as a function of density through eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) .",
    "our results agreed very well with some recent rg calculations@xcite .",
    "here we use @xmath13 together with eq .",

    "[ fig : w02-w0semi ] .",
    "these results are also compared to direct computer simulations of @xmath35 saw polymers@xcite . even though the @xmath35 simulations have not quite reached the scaling limit , the well - depths at contact",
    "are remarkably well reproduced , a result also found by tuinier and lekkerkerker@xcite with a similar theory .",
    "the simplest approximation for the depletion potential at finite separation @xmath19 would be a linear form with a slope equal to the osmotic pressure .",
    "this follows because @xmath36 is the volume term proportional to the work per unit area produced by the osmotic pressure : @xmath37 where the range is given by @xmath38 we note that this approximation is similar to that adopted by joanny , leibler , and de gennes who , in their pioneering paper@xcite , approximated the force between two plates as constant for @xmath39 and zero for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the correlation length , the relevant length - scale in the semi - dilute regime@xcite .",
    "this also results in a linear depletion potential .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vwall - simple ] we compare our simple linear potential to the direct saw simulations .",
    "the overall agreement is striking .",
    "the only ( small ) deviation occurs at larger distances @xmath19 where the true potential rounds off and develops a very small maximum before going to zero@xcite .",
    "the range @xmath42 of this simple potential decreases with @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : range ] , the largest relative rate of decrease occurs in the dilute regime , so that at @xmath43 , the range is @xmath44 , about @xmath45 of the low density limit of @xmath46 . in general , the range of a potential is not always unambiguously defined@xcite .",
    "of course for our linear one it is , and this simple definition would seem a very reasonable definition for the range of the full depletion potentials depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vwall - simple ] .",
    "further simplifications occur in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "for example , when the scaling forms@xcite for the osmotic pressure , @xmath47 and the reduced adsorption @xmath48 are used in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) , then , as shown in paper i , the integral simplifies and the potential at contact takes on the very simple form : @xmath49 the linear depletion potential ( [ eq2.6 ] ) then reduces to : @xmath50 and the range has simplified to @xmath51 as can be seen in figs  [ fig : w02-w0semi ]  and  [ fig : range ] , these simple expressions for the well - depth and the range work remarkably well in the semi - dilute regime , especially for @xmath15 .    deviations",
    "do occur for low densities since according to ( [ eq2.1 ] ) and ( [ eq2.2 ] ) , @xmath52 for @xmath53 , the same form as for ideal polymers .",
    "( [ eq2.7 ] ) therefore overestimates the well depth by a factor @xmath54 , as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : w02-w0semi ] . in the same limit the range of the depletion potential reduces to the functional form @xmath55 ,",
    "so that eq .",
    "( [ eq2.9 ] ) also overestimates the range at low densities by a factor @xmath54 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : range ] .    in the semi - dilute regime",
    "one can identify @xmath56@xcite .",
    "therefore the ansatz @xmath57 , originally postulated by joanny et al.@xcite , is very close to @xmath58 , the expression we derived for the range of the depletion potential in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "their potential is therefore quite accurate in the semi - dilute regime , but overestimates the range and the well - depth by a factor slightly larger than @xmath54 in the dilute limit .      for completeness",
    "we compare the results obtained in the previous section to those for ideal polymers , first obtained by asakura and oosawa in 1954@xcite .",
    "their ( exact ) depletion potential can be quite accurately approximated by a simple linear form@xcite : @xmath59 however , for interacting polymers , this is only true in the limit @xmath53 ; the validity of this expression rapidly deteriorates with increasing density . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w02-w0semi ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.10 ] ) underestimates the well depth for all but the lowest densities , while , as shown in fig  [ fig : range ] , it overestimates the range at all densities .",
    "one might think that replacing the ideal pressure @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.10 ] ) by the pressure of an interacting polymer system would bring an improvement for the well depth , even if this does not improve the approximation for the range . instead , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w02-w0semi ] , this naive approach leads to a severe overestimate of the well - depth .",
    "in fact , for the semi - dilute regime , the contact value of this naive `` improvement '' would scale as @xmath61 instead of the correct @xmath62 scaling .",
    "even for @xmath63 the differences are significant : @xmath64 , while @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 !",
    "in other words , the simple heuristic ansatz is almost never a real improvement ; for interacting polymers , the asakura - oosawa potential between two plates is only accurate at the very lowest of densities .",
    "we now turn to the polymer induced depletion interaction between two hard spheres . similarly to the case of two walls , when the surfaces of two such spheres are brought to within a distance where their depletion layers begin to overlap , the total free energy of the system changes ; this change again defines the depletion potential .",
    "since we found in paper i that the surface tensions associated with the polymer depletion layers around a single sphere show behavior which differs from that of ideal polymers or that of the ao model , we expect to find qualitative differences in the depletion potentials as well . the trends are expected to be similar to those found for the depletion potential between two walls , namely that the range should decrease and the well depth should increase with increasing polymer concentration .      to directly calculate the polymer induced depletion potential between two spheres , we performed grand - canonical simulations of @xmath71 saw polymers on a lattice of size @xmath72 , and computed the osmotic pressure or force exerted on two hard spheres placed in the same simulation box .",
    "the configuration space of polymers was sampled in the grand canonical ensemble with a combination of configurational bias monte carlo and pivot moves@xcite .",
    "the depletion force on the spheres was obtained from the ratio of the acceptance of virtual inward and outward moves of the spheres .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : forces ] these forces are shown for three different size ratios @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "for the first two size ratios , we computed the forces at three densities , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79@xcite , for @xmath76 , this was only done for the lower two densities . as expected , for a fixed size ratio , the range decreases , and the force at contact increases with increasing polymer density .",
    "for a given density , the range appears to contract slightly with increasing @xmath5 , as might be expected , since the polymers can deform more readily around the smaller colloids ( see the appendix for further discussion of this point ) . in each simulation",
    "we keep the size of the polymers fixed , so that the larger size ratios essentially correspond to smaller spheres .",
    "the computational costs scales with the size of the simulation box , which roughly sets the number of polymers needed to achieve a density @xmath29 in the accessible volume left by the colloids .",
    "the force can then be integrated to obtain the effective depletion potential : @xmath80 results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrad16-ejm - newpot ] for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : forces ] .",
    "because the curves are integrated , they appear smoother than the forces .",
    "there may still be some residual error in the potentials , which may explain why the range for the highest density seems slightly larger for the potential than for the force .",
    "also , the errors are likely too large to decide whether or not there is a repulsive bump in the potential .",
    "if it does exist , it is probably very small@xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to hard - core systems , where such bumps can be pronounced@xcite .",
    "the weakness or absence of a repulsive barrier in the case of interacting polymers can probably be traced to the very low monomer concentration @xmath11 . for shorter polymers ,",
    "whose behavior deviates significantly from the @xmath81 scaling limit , and where a substantial monomer density @xmath11 can more easily be achieved , such repulsive bumps might occur more readily@xcite .",
    "as expected , the range decreases while the force at contact and the potential well - depth increase with increasing polymer density . for a fixed density and polymer size @xmath0 , the force at contact and the well - depth decrease as the spheres become smaller ( or @xmath5 becomes larger ) .",
    "the same effect occurs for ideal polymers@xcite , where it has a simple geometric origin : the volume of a depletion layer of a given width @xmath82 decreases with decreasing size of the hard spheres .      in the case of two walls , the well - depth at contact",
    "has a clear interpretation in terms of the complete destruction of two depletion layers , and can therefore be expressed as a simple function of the wall - polymer surface tension @xmath13 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) . for two spheres ,",
    "the depletion layers do not completely overlap , and the depletion potential at contact is related to the surface tension of polymers surrounding two spheres in a dumbbell type configuration .",
    "a simple expression for the well depth at contact in terms of the surface tension @xmath83 is therefore less obvious .",
    "one way to make contact with the two wall case is to use the derjaguin approximation@xcite , which relates the force between two spheres of radius @xmath2 to the potential between two walls , @xmath84 , in the following way : @xmath85 where @xmath19 is the distance between the surfaces of the two spheres . in principle",
    "this approximation should only be accurate for very small size ratios @xmath5 , i.e.  for very large colloids .",
