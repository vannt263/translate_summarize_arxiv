    "it is clear that below the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath6 , the effective theory is the sm .",
    "this fact enables us to use the sm effective potential for the higgs boson when we treat the lightest higgs boson in the mssm .    as shown in @xcite , in order to calculate the higgs boson mass up to the next - to - leading logarithm approximation , we must consider the one - loop ep improved by two - loop rge for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 functions of the running coupling constants , masses and the @xmath33field for the higgs boson .",

    "we have not included the contributions from the gauge boson and would - be goldstone bosons because their contributions are negligible compared to those from the heavy fermions @xcite .",
    "note that our definition of @xmath28 differs by a factor of @xmath46 from most author s conventions .",
    "the above expression for the ep was obtained using the modified minimal substraction ( @xmath47 ) renormalization scheme , and all of the rge for the running couplings constants and masses listed in the appendix correspond to the choice of the landau gauge . in the @xmath47 scheme",
    ", the ep does not satisfy the usual homogenous rge unless an appropriate @xmath48 - independent term , which is the one - loop contribution to the cosmological constant , is added to the above expression .",
    "when such an appropriate term is included , the ep satisfies the usual homogeneous rge : @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 is the anomalous dimension of the higgs field .",
    "all of the parameters @xmath53 run with energy , and so the rge for the ep essentially states that a change in energy scale can be compensated for by a change in the values of the coupling constants and masses to ensure the renormalization group invariance of the ep .",

    "zero threshold corrections correspond to @xmath106 .",
    "maximum threshold corrections occur for @xmath107 . in this case",
    "the threshold correction becomes : @xmath108 the appropiate three generation boundary conditions are simply obtained by once again setting all of the fourth generation yukawa couplings to zero .",
    "we use the runge - kutta method to numerically integrate the appropriate rge . in order to derive the mssm4 upper bound on the higgs boson mass , we solve the system of coupled equations represented by equation ( 7 ) , using the @xmath29 functions listed in appendix b , by demanding consistency between the initial values at the degenerate fourth generation mass scale and the boundary conditions for the total set of couplings .",
    "for the three generation case , we solve the same system using the @xmath29 functions listed in appendix a by demanding consistency between the initial values at the @xmath109 scale and the boundary conditions for @xmath28 and the top quark coupling .    before presenting our mssm(3,4 ) results",
    ", it is appropriate at this point to discuss our choice of the range of @xmath26 . using the same criteria as gunion et al .",
    "@xcite ; i.e. demanding pertubative validity of the yukawa couplings out to the gut scale where the gauge coulings unify , we can determind an upper bound for @xmath26 .",
    "this constraint translates into the condition @xmath110 and into the requirement that two - loop contributions are small compared to the one - loop contributions in the rge out to the gut scale .    to check perturbative validity of the yukawa couplings out to the gut scale",
    ", we solve the sm rge subject to the boundary conditions given above and run the couplings out to the susy breaking scale , either 1 tev or 10 tev .",
    "the mssm4 beta functions listed in appendix c are then used to evolve the couplings out to the gut scale .",
    "the limit on the degenerate fourth generation fermion mass can be extracted when @xmath111 just saturates the above criteria of pertubative validity at the gut scale .",
    "it is clear from the beta functions in appendix c that @xmath111 grows the fastest of all the yukawa couplings when it is evolved with the mssm4 rge because @xmath112 for @xmath111 does not have terms proportional to minus @xmath113 .",
    "note that because the fourth generation neutral lepton carries less hypercharge than does the fourth generation charged lepton , the terms proportional to minus the @xmath114 in its rge are less significant for @xmath111 than for @xmath115 , allowing the terms contributing positively to @xmath112 for @xmath111 to dominate more readily . for @xmath15 tev and 10 tev ,",
    "we have observed that the upper bound on a degenerate fourth generation fermion mass @xmath116 gev .    our numerical value for the upper bound of @xmath117 differ from those of gunion et al .",
    "@xcite for at least two reasons .",
    "first , while gunion et al . only assume degeneracy among the quark and lepton sectors separately , we adopt a completely degenerate fourth generation , principally so as to reduce the number of parameters .",
    "second , and more importantly , the discrepancy between the two results arises from different choices of @xmath6 and application of appropriate rge .",
    "gunion et al .",
    "choose @xmath6 as @xmath118 and use the susy rge even below the low susy breaking scale of @xmath118 .",
    "their results allow for much heavier quarks @xmath119 gev , @xmath120 gev , while they restrict the leptons to lower masses @xmath121 gev .",
    "as mentioned above , we choose @xmath6 as 1 tev or 10 tev and use the sm4 rge to evolve couplings below @xmath6 .",
    "even with this derived bound on a possible fourth generation degenerate fermion mass , we continue to consider the cases of increasing @xmath26 all the way out to @xmath26 = 250 gev , just as in our one - loop results @xcite .",
    "these `` out of bounds '' cases are still considered because neglecting them involves the implicit assumption that no new physics becomes manifest between @xmath6 and the gut scale . if this assumption is relaxed , the above requirement of pertubative validity all the way out to the gut scale is clearly not necessary , it is only necessary for pertubative validity to hold out to some intervening mass scale between @xmath6 and @xmath122 .",
    "the choice of 250 gev as the cut - off for @xmath26 arises from requiring @xmath123 out to @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to note that for @xmath124 gev , the possibility of gauge unification is lost and the hierarchy problem becomes less drastic , thereby weakening the need for supersymmetry . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one of the most appealing features of the mssm theories is the possibility of gauge unification .",
    "all values of @xmath125 110 gev eradicate this feature .",
    "another reason for considering supersymmetry is that it helps provide a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "supersymmetry makes sense out of the tremendous difference between the weak scale and the gut scale where new physics holds . as @xmath26 increases , pertubative validity",
    "requires that new physics start at some scale @xmath1 less than the gut scale .",
    "@xmath1 descreases with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "as the difference between the weak scale and @xmath1 becomes smaller , the hierarchy problem becomes less and less drastic , thereby weakening the motivation for supersymmetry .    in fig .",
    "( 1 ) we present our numerical two - loop results for the lightest higgs boson mass bounds in the mssm4(solid lines ) as a function of @xmath26 for the case @xmath15 tev and ( a ) no threshold corrections and ( b ) maximum threshold corrections . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) and fig .",
    "( 2 ) , the upper curve corresponds to @xmath126 and the lower curve to @xmath127 . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also present the lightest higgs boson mass bounds in mssm3(dotted lines ) for the same paarameter sets .",
    "our three generation results are in agreement with those of casas et al .",
    "2 shows the case for @xmath128 tev . in the analysis",
    ", we fix the running top quark mass @xmath129 gev and @xmath130 . after shifting to pole masses ,",
    "we find @xmath131 = 177 gev in all cases .",
    "as @xmath26 increases @xmath13 of the mssm4 increases rapidly . choosing @xmath126 results in a greater upper bound on the higgs mass ,",
    "primarily because this choice requires a larger initial value of @xmath132 which in turn makes @xmath28 larger at the scale where the mass is evaluated . as one can see from figs . 1 and 2",
    ", the presence of the fourth generation raises the lightest higgs mass compared to the three generation case .",
    "in particular , in the range 50 gev@xmath133 110 gev which permits a susy gut , the difference between the mssm3 and mssm4 bounds on @xmath13 ranges from 7 gev ( @xmath26 = 50 gev ) to 30 gev ( @xmath134 gev ) . for the case",
    "@xmath128 tev , the difference becomes more pronounced .    in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , we present the one - loop running higgs mass @xmath135 ( solid lines ) and the two - loop running higgs mass @xmath135 ( dotted line ) results in the mssm4 .",
    "our one - loop results are based on the analysis given in @xcite . as can be seen from those figures ,",
    "the difference between one - loop @xmath135 and two - loop @xmath135 results in the @xmath15 tev case becomes larger as @xmath26 increases , but the difference between the one and two - loop depends strongly on @xmath136 . for @xmath126 , the two - loop results are positive with respect to the one - loop results , while for @xmath137 , the two - loop affects lower the one - loop results in the region 50 gev @xmath138 100 gev .",
    "a similar situation holds for the @xmath128 tev case , where @xmath137 leads to negative two - loop contributions for @xmath139 gev .",
    "the abscissa of our plots is to be interpreted as the running mass of the degenerate fourth generation leptons .",
    "the pole masses of the fourth generation quarks , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , are slightly greater than @xmath26 , and this difference increases with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "for example , when @xmath26 = 50 gev , both @xmath140 and @xmath141 are @xmath5 52.5 gev .",
    "when @xmath26 = 170 gev , both @xmath140 and @xmath141 are @xmath5 177 gev .",
    "lastly , when @xmath26 = 250 gev , @xmath140 and @xmath141 are @xmath5 261 gev .",
    "in this section , we study the lower bounds on the higgs boson mass in the sm with three and four fermion generations .",
    "let us describe our procedure for determining a lower bound on the higgs boson mass in the sm .",
    "again , we employ a consistent two - loop analysis and use equation ( 23 ) .",
    "we first alert the reader to our phenomenologically viable assumption that the physical vacuum corresponding to the vaccum expectation of the higgs field of 246 gev is indeed the true vacuum of the effective potential ; i.e. that the physical vacuum corresponds to a global , not merely a local , minimum of the effective potential .",
    "this assumption is consistent with our intention to accept the sm as a truly valid theory and compute the consequences ; i.e. to zeroth order there is no motivation to consider the physical vacuum to be anything other than the true vacuum . if one considers the possibility that the physical vacuum is a meta - stable vacuum with a lifetime longer than the age of the universe , that there exist deeper minima of the potential , then the sm lower bounds on the higgs boson mass become less stringent in general for certain choices of @xmath1 and @xmath142 @xcite . but for @xmath143 gev and @xmath144 gev , the sm3 absolute stability lower bound is relaxed by only @xmath145 gev when one only immposes metastability requirements , and this small effect only becomes diminished with the inclusion of a fourth generation .",
    "we obtain lower limits on the sm higgs boson mass by requiring stability of this observed vacuum @xcite .    working with the two - loop rge",
    "requires the imposition of one - loop boundary conditions on the running parameters . as pointed out by casas et al .",
    "@xcite , the necessary condition for vacuum stability is derived from requiring that the effective coupling @xmath146 0 rather than @xmath147 for @xmath148 , where @xmath1 is the cut - off beyond which the sm is no longer valid .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath149 in the sm4 is defined as : @xmath150 \\right\\}\\ ] ] where the three generation case is simply the same as the above expression without the fourth generation yukawa coupling contributions .",
    "we then solve the rge in the same manner as in the susy case but impose this boundary condition on @xmath149 .",
    "again , we fix @xmath151 = 170 gev and @xmath152 .    before discussing the higgs boson mass bound ,",
    "let us consider an upper bound on @xmath26 .",
    "this upper bound can be determined by considering the so - called `` triviality '' bound on the higgs mass derived from the requirement that no landau pole occurs for @xmath149 all the way out to the cut - off scale @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath26 could continue out to any value up to the cut - off @xmath1 , then one would presumably obtain both a lower bound on the higgs mass from considerations of vacuum stability as well as an upper bound from the requirement @xmath153 ; i.e. , that there be no landau pole for @xmath149 out to @xmath1 .",
    "but clearly @xmath26 must be bounded from above somehow , for otherwise all of the fourth generation yukawa couplings will become nonpertubative at some scale well below @xmath1 , which in turn would feed the other couplings via the rge until they also become nonpertubative . in this way , we can obtain an upper bound for @xmath26 , the value of @xmath26 where the vacuum stability and `` triviality '' bounds coincide . for @xmath129 gev and @xmath154 gev ,",
    "it turns out that the upper bound on @xmath26 is @xmath5 100 gev .",
    "interestingly , this value is close to the upper bound on @xmath26 derived in the mssm4 .    in fig .",
    "5(a ) , the upper curve is the sm4 lower bound on the higgs mass derived from vacuum stability requirements .",
    "the cut - off scale @xmath1 is @xmath18 gev and @xmath128 tev .",
    "the horizontal line just beneath it is the sm3 lower bound .",
    "the curve starting below the sm3 lower bound is the mssm4 upper bound with susy parameters @xmath128 tev , @xmath126 and maximum threshold corrections ; i.e. , the absolute maximum mssm4 upper bound .",
    "the bottom flat line is the mssm3 upper bound for the same set of susy parameters .",
    "5(b ) displays the same results for @xmath6 = 1 tev and the same set of remaining susy parameters as above .",
    "these curves intersect and divide the ( @xmath155 ) plane into several regions .",
    "eventual measurement of the higgs mass and any experimental evidence for a fourth generation of fermions could serve as a filter to select among or to discard some of the four theories considered .",
    "for example , a light higgs mass ( @xmath156 gev ) would rule out both the sm3 and the sm4 independently of any considerations of @xmath26 .",
    "the region above the bottom curve completely rules out the mssm3 and mssm4 . considering just the four gerneration theories",
    ", it is interesting to note that the region between the two highest lying curves , where both the sm4 and the mssm4 are excluded as viable theories , is increasing in area as @xmath26 increases .",
    "this behaviour further suggests that any possible fourth generation fermions must have masses not much greater than 100 gev .",
    "recall that the results we present are all derived with a running top quark mass @xmath157 = 170 gev and @xmath158 .",
    "this @xmath157 results in all cases in an @xmath131 = 177 gev .",
    "we now discuss the uncertainties to be assigned to our results induced by the uncertainties in @xmath131 and @xmath159 for all four theories . for the mssm3",
    ", @xmath160 gev induces shifts in @xmath131 of @xmath161 gev and in the higgs boson mass upper bound of @xmath162 gev .",
    "when we let @xmath163 , the bounds shift downward by@xmath164 1 gev and when @xmath165 , the bounds shift upward by@xmath164 1 gev .",
    "the above results correspond to @xmath6 = 1 tev .",
    "choosing @xmath128 tev leaves the @xmath159 behaviour unaltered , but the uncertainties in the higgs mass upper bound induced by @xmath166 gev grow to @xmath167 5 gev .",
    "the mssm4 uncertainties are virtually identical to the mssm3 uncertainties . for the sm3 , letting @xmath168 = @xmath167 5 gev results in changes in the higgs boson mass vacuum stability lower bound of @xmath167 9 gev . for the sm4 ,",
    "the induced shift is similar , @xmath169 gev .",
    "for both the sm3 and the sm4 the uncertainties in @xmath159 result in larger shifts of the higgs boson mass than in the mssm theories .",
    "when @xmath159 changes by @xmath167 .005 , the lower bounds in the sm theories change by @xmath170 6 gev .    in conclusion , we have studied the upper bounds on the lightest higgs boson mass @xmath13 in the mssm with four generations by solving the two - loop rges and using the one - loop ep .",
    "we have considered the fourth generation of quarks and leptons with the degenerate mass @xmath26 .",
    "our implementation of the appropriate two - loop rge makes our results the most precise determination of the sm4 and mssm4 higgs mass bounds to date .",
    "we have shown how the bounds on @xmath13 depend on @xmath26 . in the region of large @xmath26 , the bounds on @xmath13 increase with increasing @xmath26 , while they are relatively insensitive to @xmath26 in the region of small @xmath26 .",
    "an upper bound on @xmath26 ( 100 gev@xmath171 110 gev ) is derived in two independent ways ; one from requiring pertubative validity all the way out to the gut scale and one from requiring vacuum stability in the pure sm4 out to the planck scale .",

    "<S> we present lower bounds on the higgs boson mass in the standard model with three and four fermion generations sm(3,4 ) , as well as upper bounds on the lightest higgs boson mass in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm with three and four generations mssm(3,4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis utilizes the sm(3,4 ) renormalization - group - improved one - loop effective potential of the higgs boson to find the upper bounds on the higgs mass in the mssm(3,4 ) while the lower bounds in the sm(3,4 ) are derived from considerations of vacuum stability . </S>",
    "<S> all the bounds increase as the degenerate fourth generation mass increases , providing more room in theory space that respects the increasing experimental lower limit of the higgs mass .    * i. introduction *    with the discovery of the top quark at the tevatron , the higgs boson is now the only unknown sector of the standard model ( sm ) . despite the remarkable agreement between theory and experiment exhibited in electroweak precision measurements </S>",
    "<S> , it is generally believed that the sm is not the final theory of elementary particle interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the sm suffers from various theoretical blemishes , most notably the naturalness / fine - tuning problem associated with one fundamental physical higgs scalar ; i.e. the vacuum expectation value is quadratically unstable against radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> another aesthetically unappealing feature of the sm is the lack of gauge unification at some gut scale , typically @xmath0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) addresses both of these issues @xcite . because of the nature of supersymmetry ( susy ) , the higgs sector in the mssm consists of two cp - conserving higgs doublets with opposite hypercharge assignments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the quartic coupling of the higgs potential is arbitrary in the sm and thus the higgs boson mass is usually considered an adjustable parameter . nevertheless , </S>",
    "<S> if certain theoretical assumptions are imposed , upper and lower bounds on the higgs boson mass can be obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement of vacuum stability yields a lower bound on the higgs boson mass which depends on the top quark mass and the cut - off scale @xmath1 beyond which the sm is no longer valid , while an upper bound follows from requiring that no landau singularity appears up to a scale @xmath1 . in the mssm , </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic upper bounds on the lightest higgs boson mass are obtained from the quartic higgs coupling which is no longer artibtrary but is constrained by susy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> much previous work has been done in this area @xcite , but previous determinations of the higgs boson mass bounds in the mssm and the sm have been forced to treat the top mass @xmath2 as an unknown parameter . </S>",
    "<S> these results display the higgs boson mass bounds as a function of the top mass for a given set of parameters . with increasing precision of the measurement of the top quark mass , the aforementioned bounds and an eventual measurement of the higgs mass can serve to either validate or discard both the mssm and the sm , even though the couplings of the lightest mssm higgs boson are indistinguishable from those of the sm higgs boson . for a top quark mass @xmath3 gev , the mssm upper bound exceeds the sm lower bound . if a higgs mass lies between these two bounds for such a top quark mass , then no new information is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs mass is measured with a value exceeding the mssm upper bound and the sm lower bound , then the sm remains the only viable theory , while if the measurement lies below the mssm upper bound and the sm lower bound , then only the mssm survives . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting situation is realized for a top quark mass @xmath4 175 gev and when the higgs mass lies in a region between the two bounds , with the sm lower bound exceeding the mssm upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation demands the introduction of new physics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we fix the running top quark mass to be 170 gev , which corresponds to a top quark pole mass of @xmath5 177 gev , the possible scenarios are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> for the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath6= 10 tev and @xmath7 and maximum threshold corrections , the upper bound on the physical higgs mass is @xmath5 142 gev , while for the same set of parameters and @xmath8 1 tev , the upper bound is @xmath5 135 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound from the sm with the cut off scale @xmath9 gev where new physics becomes absolutely necessary is @xmath5 148 gev . </S>",
    "<S> as the experimental lower bound for the higgs boson mass continues to rise , these theoretical bounds become more and more relevant . </S>",
    "<S> if the mssm is a faithful description of nature , then @xmath10 gev for @xmath11 tev and so should be detected in the very near future . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson may be detected with @xmath12 gev and all of the attractive features of the mssm , e.g. gauge unification , a taming of the naturalness / fine - tuning problem , etc . </S>",
    "<S> remain intact . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> suppose the experimental lower limit on @xmath13 is pushed above 142 gev . </S>",
    "<S> such a scenario rules out the mssm as a viable theory . </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs mass is eventually measured and is greater than @xmath5 148 gev , then the sm provides a consistent and faithful description of nature all the way up to energy scales of @xmath14 . for @xmath15 tev , the region 135 gev@xmath16 gev rules out both the sm and the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> if a higgs boson is measured with a mass lying within this range consistent with all electroweak precision data to date , should we simply abandon the sm and all of its remarkable successes ? </S>",
    "<S> noting that all the precision electroweak data indicates that @xmath17 370 gev at one sigma order @xcite , we take the opposite approach , in the sense that we add an extra representation , a fourth generation , to both theories and calculate the higgs mass bounds in the standard model with four generations ( sm4 ) and in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model with four generations ( mssm4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothetical fourth generation will differ from the familiar three in more ways than one , but most importantly the fourth generation neutral lepton must be massive with a mass greater than half the z boson mass in order to not disturb the agreement between theory and experiment in measurements of the z width @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so as best to be able to use the aforementioned bounds as a filter to discriminate between the mssm higgs boson and the pure sm higgs boson , we will fix @xmath1 to be @xmath18 gev , the scale where we know new physics becomes necessary in order to incorporate gravity . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that lower values of @xmath1 relax the sm lower bounds @xcite , but we note that the lower bounds on the sm higgs boson mass are insensitive to the precise value of @xmath1 for large @xmath1 ; i.e. for @xmath19 gev@xmath20 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> several authors have derived the upper and lower bounds on the higgs boson mass in the sm with extra generations as a function of the extra fermion masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds on the lightest higgs boson mass in the mssm4 have been calculated very recently in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , those bounds are based on one - loop order renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> as pointed out by casas et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the one - loop predictions of mass bounds of the sm higgs and the lightest mssm higgs boson are strongly dependent on the scale at which the higgs boson masses are calculated , while the two - loop results are almost flat as a function of scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , two - loop results are more stable and meaningful . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to examine the physical ( pole ) higgs boson mass bounds in the sm4 and the mssm4 up to the two - loop level .    </S>",
    "<S> the search for the higgs boson being one of the major tasks along with that for supersymmetric sparticle and fourth generation fermions at future accelerators such as lep200 and lhc makes it a theoretical priority to examine the bounds on the higgs boson mass in the sm and its supersymmetric extension and to look for any distinctive features . </S>",
    "<S> the actual measurement of the higgs boson mass could serve to exclude or at least to distinguish between the sm(3,4 ) and the mssm(3,4 ) models for electroweak symmetry breaking . in order to carry out this procedure </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt the basic assumptions that all superpartners of the sm particles as well as another higgs scalar orthogonal to the lightest one have masses of the order of the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath6 so that the effective low - energy theory below @xmath6 is equivalent to the sm with a single higgs doublet ( sm3 or sm4 ) @xcite .    since the bounds on the higgs boson mass in the models with four generations depend on the fourth generation fermion masses </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to impose some possible constraints on the fourth generation fermion masses . </S>",
    "<S> the close agreement between the direct measurements of the top quark mass at the tevatron and its indirect determination from the global fits of precision electroweak data including radiative corrections within the framework of the sm imply that there is no significant violation of the isospin symmetry for the extra generation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the masses of the fourth generation isopartners must be very close to degenerate ; i.e. @xmath21 we are subscribing to the philosophy of trying to be as least destructive as possible to the sm in our proposal of an additional generation of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> one argument often cited to disparage the sm as being an incomplete , effective theoy , a mere model , is the existence of the large number of free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for aesthetic reasons no different in principle from the accepted reasons for possibility of gauge coupling unification in the mssm as additional support for its likely validity , we propose the simplest non - trivial solution to the phenomenologically imposed inequalities : a completely degenerate fourth generation , thus appealing to aesthetic proclivities as a compensation for extending the sm by this additional mass parameter . </S>",
    "<S> one can think of the analogy of a forced , damped harmonic oscillator , where the more familiar three generations are analogous to the arbitrary initlal conditions contained in the transient solution , while the degenerate fourth generation is analogous to the in - phase , steady - state solution . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the limit on the masses of the extra neutral and charged leptons , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , has been improved by lep1.5 to @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis yields upper bounds on @xmath26 that are the same in both the mssm4 and sm4 cases . as will be discussed in detail later , the upper bound derived in the sm4 case results from requiring vacuum stability with a cut - off at the planck scale @xmath9 gev while that derived in the mssm4 results from requiring pertubative validity out to the gut scale . imposing these constraints leads us to restrict the range of @xmath26 to 50 gev @xmath27 gev . </S>",
    "<S> if we restrict @xmath26 to lie within this range of values , why has there been no direct experimental observation of a fourth generation at the tevatron ? as we mentioned earlier , our proposed fourth generation differs qualitatively from the other three . </S>",
    "<S> because of the mass degeneracy between isodoublets , w decay products resulting from a transition between fourth generation isopartners will be vanishingly soft and such a scenario could be hidden in the data . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we will assume that the fourth generation quarks do not mix with the known quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is plausible since the mixing angles are so small that the new particles can leave the tevatron detectors without decaying .    </S>",
    "<S> our paper is organized as follows . in section </S>",
    "<S> i , we first present our one - loop effective potential(ep ) improved by the two - loop renormalization group equations ( rge ) analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , to the best of our knowledge , the present work is the first to present and to apply the sm4 two - loop rge with a massive fourth generation neutral lepton . just as the two - loop corrections contribute significantly to the resulting bounds in the three generation case @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we find that our two - loop results provide substantial contributions to previous one - loop results for the four generation theories previously calculated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an expression for the higgs boson mass is derived up to next - to - leading logarithm order . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii our method for solving the rge so as to evaluate the expressions for the mass is described . </S>",
    "<S> we first evaluate this expression at the appropiate energy scale in order to make a meaningful comparison with our earlier one - loop results . </S>",
    "<S> next , following the example of casas et al.@xcite , we shift all running masses to the physical pole masses . </S>",
    "<S> upper bounds are obtained by imposing different boundary conditions on the higgs self - coupling @xmath28 which correspond to different values of supersymmetric mixing parameters , tan@xmath29 , and supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are presented and a bound on @xmath26 derived from requirements of pertubative validity out to the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn in section iii to our analysis of the vacuum stability bounds in the sm3 and the sm4 . </S>",
    "<S> another independent upper bound on @xmath26 is derived which is the same as that derived in the mssm4 case . finally , we compare all four scenarios and discuss the errors associated with our results arising from uncertainties in the strong coupling constant and the value of the top quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> all of the relevant renormalization group equations are presented in the appendix . </S>"
