    "the first fermi - lat catalog of grbs ( ackermann et al 2013a ) presents temporal and spectral information on the emission above 100 mev measured by the fermi satellite during the prompt ( burst ) and extended ( afterglow ) phases of 28 grbs . for several well - monitored sources ,",
    "the high - energy emission displays a power - law decay in time .",
    "that behaviour and the x - ray and gev fluxes being compatible with each other within the blast - wave afterglow model , prompted kumar & barniol duran ( 2009 , 2010 ) to attribute the lat high - energy emission to the forward - shock that powers the afterglow emission at lower ( optical and x - ray ) photon energies ( see also ghirlanda et al 2010 ) .    for four bright fermi long - grbs ( 080916c - ackermann et al 2013a ; 090902b - abdo et al 2009a ; 090926a - ackermann et al 2011 ;",
    "110731 - ackermann et al 2013b ) , the lat prompt - emission spectrum ( above 100 mev ) is a power - law harder than the band spectrum of the gbm emission ( above @xmath0 kev ) . for three of those bursts ,",
    "the slope of the lat power - law spectrum does not change ( within measurement errors ) at the end of the prompt phase .",
    "furthermore , the lat light - curve is continuous at the end of the burst , in all four cases .",
    "these two facts indicate that , at least for bright long - grbs , the lat emission mechanism is the same as for the afterglow ( i.e. the forward - shock ) .",
    "the absorption of high - energy photons , discussed by fenimore et al ( 1993 ) for cgro - batse bursts , has been reconsidered for the gev photons of fermi - lat bursts ( e.g. abdo et al 2009 ) and used to set lower limits on the _ burst _ source lorentz factor , usually found to be between 200 and 1000 ( e.g. ackermann et al 2013a ) .",
    "a detailed treatment of the source dynamics has been shown to reduce those limits ( granot et al 2008 , hascoet et al 2012 ) , as does the possibility that the burst mev emission ( the target photons for the gev test photons ) arose at a smaller radius than the lat emission ( zou et al 2011 , hascoet et al 2012 ) .",
    "direct evidence for photon - photon attenuation in lat afterglows exists only for the afterglow 090926a ( ackermann et al 2011 ) , whose spectrum shows a cut - off at 2 gev . the optical thickness to pair - formation should vary with time , yielding a variable cut - off energy in the lat spectrum and a variable slope of the attenuated spectrum .",
    "an evolving optical thickness can also alter the flux of the emergent emission , and the attenuated light - curve should be correlated with the spectral evolution .",
    "the purpose of this article is to identify the effects that pair - formation has on the afterglow light - curve , and the correlation between features of the attenuated light - curve and the spectrum evolution .",
    "first , we calculate the optical thickness to photon - photon absorption of the forward - shock emission on itself , quantifying its flux with the aid of lat measurements ( taken as a proxy for the unattenuated , intrinsic afterglow emission ) .",
    "then , we consider how that optical thickness evolves while the forward - shock flux , radius , and lorentz factor vary , and study the attenuated forward - shock light - curve .",
    "finally , we compare the expected features of the attenuated light - curve and the corresponding spectral evolution with fermi - lat observations of grb afterglows .",
    "first , we argue that most of the target photons that absorb a test - photon ( of energy @xmath1 above 100 mev ) were produced within the last dynamical timescale since the test - photon was released .",
    "the kinematics of the interaction between a target - photon emitted at radius @xmath2 by a spherical surface , moving at lorentz factor @xmath3 , interacting with a test - photon at radius @xmath4 shows that the angle ( relative to the radial direction ) at which the target - photon was emitted is @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",

    "the afterglow unabsorbed energy flux above the test - photon energy @xmath1 is normalized to @xmath68 , which , for @xmath61 , corresponds to a photon flux @xmath69 in the 100 mev10 gev range , as typically measured by lat at @xmath70 10 s after trigger .",
    "given some of the approximations made , the coefficient given in equation ( [ tau ] ) is likely mis - estimated by a factor of about 2 , but that leads to a small error in the following results for the ejecta lorentz factor , because that coefficient is raised to a small , sub - unity power .",
    "a larger error is made if the afterglow power - law spectrum measured by lat above 100 mev does not extend sufficiently below 100 mev , which may happen if the lat emission process is inverse - compton .",
    "alternatively , if the lat emission is synchrotron , then afterglow x - ray observations ( which indicate that the peak of synchrotron spectrum is below 1 kev at 1001000 s ) imply that the synchrotron power - law spectrum is well below 100 mev even at the earliest lat measurement .",
    "equation ( [ tau0 ] ) quantifies the optical thickness to pair - formation for a lat test - photon absorbed by a target - photon that arose from the same mechanism as the lat emission , i.e. a target - photon that is the extrapolation of the lat spectrum below 100 mev ( equation [ epst ] ) .",
    "_ during the burst _ , the absorption of ( more than ) 100 mev lat photons on ( less than ) 10 mev grb photons can be estimated from equation ( [ final ] ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the fluences of each component , @xmath73 is the peak energy of the prompt emission , @xmath74 is the low edge of the lat range , all photon energies are in @xmath75 units , and we allowed for different lorentz factors of the prompt and afterglow sources .",
    "the lat afterglow fluence @xmath76 during the prompt phase is 150 percent of the 10 kev1 mev prompt emission fluence @xmath77 ( ackermann et al 2013a ) .",
    "the grb spectrum being softer ( @xmath78 ) than the spectrum of the lat afterglow ( @xmath79 ) , decreases the relative number of burst photons above the threshold of @xmath80 mev ( equation [ epst ] ) for pair - formation by a factor @xmath81 , for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "given that the afterglow source is unlikely to be more relativistic than the grb source ( @xmath84 ) , it follows that , for the brighter lat afterglows ( @xmath85 ) , pair - formation opacity for 100 mev photons on burst photons is negligible relative to that on afterglow photons , provided that the lat power - law spectrum extends below @xmath80 mev ( equation [ epst ] )",
    ". however , for the dimmer lat afterglows ( @xmath86 ) , pair - formation on burst photons should be dominant . in that case , the lower limits on the afterglow source initial lorentz factor @xmath87 derived below ( from the condition of optical thinness for the 100 mev afterglow photons ) are underestimations .",
    "_ after the burst _",
    ", a lat test - photon can be absorbed by a grb target - photon , even though the former was emitted ( at @xmath4 ) after the latter ( at @xmath88 ) , provided that grb photon moves at a sufficiently large angle @xmath89 relative to the lat photon s direction ( toward the observer ) . according to equation ( [ gamma ] ) , the grb photon",
    "s emission angle must be larger than the inverse of the grb source lorentz factor , which implies that the burst emission absorbing the lat afterglow emission is highly `` de - beamed '' relativistically , by a factor @xmath90 . adding that to equation ( [ grbaglow ] ) and taking into account that the afterglow fluence @xmath76 is only slowly decreasing after the burst",
    ", it follows that the absorption of lat photons by the grb emission can be ignored safely .",
    "the interaction of the relativistic ejecta with the ambient medium drives a reverse shock into the ejecta shell and forward shock that sweeps the ambient medium . before the reverse shock sweeps up the ejecta shell , both shocked fluids move at the same and constant lorentz factor .",
    "after the reverse shock has crossed the ejecta shell , the motion of the shocked fluids is significantly decelerated by the interaction with ambient medium .",
    "the deceleration timescale @xmath91 , defined by the reverse shock having crossed the ejecta shell , is also the time when a substantial fraction of the ejecta energy has been transferred to the swept - up ambient medium . for simplicity , we consider only the case of a sufficiently thin / dense shell of relativistic ejecta ; then , at @xmath92 , the shocked fluid moves at nearly the lorentz factor @xmath87 of the unshocked ejecta . in the case of a thick / tenuous ejecta shell , the pre - deceleration lorentz factor of the shocked fluid",
    "depends on the geometrical thickness @xmath93 of the ejecta shell and the following calculation would yield a constraint on @xmath93 instead of @xmath87 .    to relate the observer arrival - time of the forward - shock photons to that shock s radius",
    ", we note that most photons are emitted from the edge of the `` visible '' area , where the radiating fluid moves at an angle @xmath94 relative to the direction toward the observer .",
    "the electrons radiating synchrotron emission above 100 mev are most likely cooling on timescale smaller than the dynamical time , hence they are located immediately behind the forward - shock , which moves that @xmath95 .",
    "then , at @xmath92 , when the source moves at constant @xmath87 , the photon arrival - time @xmath96 is @xmath97 the shock radius @xmath4 can be substituted in equation ( [ tau ] ) , leading to @xmath98    to continue , the time - evolution of @xmath57 is needed . for that",
    ", we assume that the afterglow emission above 100 mev is synchrotron from the forward - shock that energizes the ambient medium , but the calculations below for the attenuated flux can be easily extended to the inverse - compton emission or to the reverse shock emission , as long as the target - photon ( below 10 mev ) and the test - photon ( above 100 mev ) are from the same spectral component ( i.e. they arise from same emission mechanism and same radiative process ) .",
    "this condition allows us to relate the flux of absorbing photons ( of energy below the lat range ) to that measured by lat .",
    "prior to the onset of deceleration and at photon energies above the cooling frequency of the synchrotron spectrum , the forward - shock synchrotron flux should rise as @xmath99 .",
    "below the cooling frequency , the rise is @xmath100 ; the following calculations would be very similar , and all the important features of the photon - photon attenuation on the emergent light - curve can be captured by the low cooling - frequency case .",
    "thus , if we parametrize the flux above 100 mev by @xmath101 , to match lat measurements at 10 s , equation ( [ ttd ] ) gives @xmath102    at the deceleration radius , about 1/3 of the initial ejecta energy has been transferred to the energized ambient medium , whose comoving frame internal energy is larger by @xmath87 than its rest - mass ( this is one of the shock - jump conditions ) .",
    "thus , the forward - shock s energy at @xmath91 is @xmath103 substituting @xmath104 in equation ( [ time ] ) , the deceleration timescale is @xmath105 after @xmath91 , the afterglow intrinsic flux should decrease as @xmath106 with @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the slope of the energy spectral flux @xmath109 , thus @xmath110 is expected for @xmath61 .",
    "equation ( [ e ] ) with @xmath4 and @xmath111 instead of @xmath104 and @xmath87 , and the general result @xmath112 lead to @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "then , equation ( [ tau0 ] ) yields @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath116 increases for @xmath117 and decreases for @xmath118 .",
    "lat afterglows have @xmath119 , thus @xmath116 should increase slowly as @xmath120 or be nearly constant at the value reached at @xmath91 .",
    "adding to this that @xmath121 increases with time , it leads to the conclusion that optical thickness to pair - formation plays a role in shaping the afterglow light - curve if @xmath122 . substituting equation ( [ td ] ) in ( [ t1 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath123 thus , for @xmath87 equal to @xmath124 we have @xmath125 .",
    "note that the critical value @xmath126 is quite well determined ( if redshift is known ) , as other quantities appear at very small powers .",
    "if @xmath127 , then @xmath128 , and pair - formation opacity is negligible , except when @xmath129 and could exceed it after @xmath91 , owing to a slow @xmath130 increase ( for @xmath61 ) . in this case , the peak of the lat light - curve occurs at the deceleration time ( @xmath131 , and equation ( [ td ] ) gives @xmath132    the interesting situation occurs for @xmath133 , for which @xmath122 . in this case",

    ".    given that @xmath140 for @xmath133 and @xmath141 for @xmath127 , it follows that there is an upper limit to the lat light - curve peak epoch , reached when @xmath142 ( i.e. for @xmath143 ) : @xmath144 a somewhat lower @xmath145^{-15/17} ... $ ] s ( with remaining quantities above at a small power ) is obtained if the synchrotron cooling frequency were above 100 mev . a similar result should be obtained if the lat emission were inverse - compton , as that changes only the rise of the afterglow flux before @xmath91 , affecting @xmath126 and @xmath146 .",
    "the existence of an upper limit to the lat light - curve peak epoch is a consequence of the intrinsic afterglow light - curve having a peak and of the optical thickness to pair - formation increasing with time ( for a wind - like medium , that optical thickness is , most likely , decreasing in time , as discussed in the next section ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the effect of photon - photon absorption on the emergent flux above 100 mev , calculated by integrating spectral flux @xmath147 attenuated by the optical thickness @xmath148 . for @xmath61 , the optical thickness increases after the deceleration time ( the peak of the intrinsic light - curve ) as @xmath130 and the attenuated flux displays a faster decay than the intrinsic light - curve .",
    "note that , for such a slowly varying optical thickness , the attenuated light - curve decay , @xmath149 , there is little curvature in the attenuated light - curve , and it still resembles a power - law .",
    "thus , lat light - curves decaying faster than expected for the forward - shock model ( i.e. faster than the x - ray emission at same time ) , may be due photon - photon attenuation in the source .",
    "figure 2 shows the obvious correlation between a significant effect of photon - photon attenuation on the lat light - curve ( fig 1 ) and the lack of higher energy photons .",
    "furthermore , figure 2 illustrates the progressive softening of the afterglow spectrum above 100 mev , owing to an increasing @xmath148 .",
    "together with the intrinsic and attenuated light - curves shown in figure 1 , this suggests the less trivial , but still intuitive , conclusion that lat light - curves decaying faster should have lat spectra that soften faster .",
    "figure 3 shows the peak flux ",
    "peak epoch curve obtained by varying the ejecta initial lorentz factor , but with the intrinsic afterglow flux fixed at the deceleration time ( instead of 10 s ) .",
    "an upper limit to the peak epoch of the emergent light - curve still exists , being characterized by @xmath150 and @xmath151 s. again , for @xmath133 , the peak flux of the emergent emission decreases fast with decreasing @xmath87 .",

    "the change in the evolution of @xmath116 across @xmath91 yields a point of inflection in the attenuated light - curve if @xmath153 , as illustrated in figure 4 . for @xmath154 not much above unity , the emergent light - curve displays a power - law decay that is slower than that of the intrinsic flux , but for @xmath155 , the attenuated light - curve has a second peak that may be detected by lat .",
    "figure 5 shows how a faster evolving @xmath116 induces an evident curvature in the attenuated light - curve .",
    "considering that @xmath156 , a spectral slope @xmath108 sufficiently far from 4/3 should illustrate that effect .",

    "as such light - curves are expected from a fast increase of @xmath116 , perhaps caused by energy injection in the forward shock , their origin in this process should be corroborated with the corresponding plateau or slow decay in the x - ray light - curve .",
    "none of the above four lat afterglows have simultaneous xrt coverage .",
    "_ afterglow rises_. lat light - curves with rises are seen for afterglows 080916c , 090510 , 090902b , 090926a , and 110731 , with peaks at 1 - 10 s. a spectral evolution throughout the entire afterglow is evidenced only for 090926a , with a spectral hardening from @xmath201 at 5 - 10 s to @xmath202 after 100 s. furthermore , the lat spectrum displays a cut - off at @xmath203 gev and at 3 - 20 s , and photons above 2 gev appear after 20 s. thus , this afterglow offers good evidence for the optical thickness to pair - formation decreasing throughout the afterglow . at late times",
    ", the spectrum should be unattenuated ; being harder than @xmath204 , it implies that the decrease in @xmath116 should be associated with a wind - like ambient medium .",
    "two - peaked light - curves and long - lived humps ( or plateaus ) could be difficult to observe with lat , given that the expected flux at the second peak or during the plateau is strongly attenuated by photon - photon absorption .",
    "an interesting effect of pair - formation is that , if the ambient medium is homogeneous , then there is an upper limit to the epoch of the light - curve peak that an adiabatic ( no energy injection ) forward shock can yield ( eq [ tpmax ] ) , that upper limit having a moderate dependence on the afterglow energy - to - ambient density ratio .",
    "later occurring peaks could be produced by a wind - like medium .",
    "none of the lat afterglows with light - curve peaks violate the upper limit for a homogeneous medium , nevertheless that does not identify the type of external medium because it may just be a selection effect : later occurring peaks are intrinsically dimmer and harder to detect .",
    "instead the identification of the ambient medium stratification can be done reliably from the evolution of the afterglow spectrum ( a softening of the afterglow spectrum is obtained only for a homogeneous medium ) .    in conclusion , there is tentative evidence that lat may have observed the effects of photon - photon attenuation in two afterglows : 090926a ( peaked ligh - curve and spectral hardening ) and 100620 ( convex light - curve and spectral softening ) , and maybe also in 110625 ( steep decay and spectral softening ) . aside from the difficulty of measuring with lat the spectral evolution that should accompany the above - listed light - curve features arising from photon - photon attenuation , the paucity of afterglows displaying the expected pair - formation features may be due to the narrow range of ejecta lorentz factors @xmath87 required for those features to occur ( @xmath205 ) and for the emergent attenuated emission not to be too dim ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "conversely , the general lack of `` self - absorption '' features in lat afterglow light - curves implies that @xmath207 , which is consistent with the lower limits on the lorentz factor inferred for gbm bursts ( ackermann et al 2013a ) .",
