    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts a phase transition from a hadron gas ( hg ) phase to a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase with variations of thermodynamic parameters such as temperature ( @xmath0 ) and/or baryon density ( @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations indicate that the chiral and de - confinement phase transitions are a smooth crossover along the temperature axis , i.e. with @xmath1 = 0 , while various other models predict that the phase transition becomes first order at high baryon density  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the qcd critical point is thus expected as the first order phase transition line should end somewhere at finite @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in order to study the properties of qgp in these experiments , it is important to choose an observable which is sensitive enough to the medium property in the early stage .    it has been proposed that the shapes of the event - by - event net - charge distributions are sensitive to the presence of the critical point , as they are related to the conserved number susceptibilities of the system and hence to the correlation length  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the shape of the emission source function can also provide signals for a second - order phase transition or proximity to the qcd critical point  @xcite .",
    "two - pion correlation measurements provide important information about the space - time evolution of the particle emitting source in the collision .",
    "an emitting system which undergoes a strong first order phase transition is expected to demonstrate a much larger space - time extent than would be expected if the system had remained in the hadronic phase throughout the collision process .",
    "the phenix detector at rhic has explored the above possibilities in the recent beam energy scan ( bes ) program of rhic . during 2010 and 2011 ,",
