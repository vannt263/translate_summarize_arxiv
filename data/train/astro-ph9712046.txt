    "abell 2029 ( a2029 ) is a richness class ii , bautz - morgan class i cluster of galaxies at a redshift of @xmath11 ( abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) . with an x - ray flux of @xmath12 ( 210 kev ) @xmath13 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath3 ( david et al .",

    "a2029 is one of the most regular rich clusters known , particularly in its x - ray properties ( slezak , durret , & gerbal 1994 ; david , jones , & forman 1995 ; buote & tsai 1996 ) . as a result",
    ", it seems likely that the intracluster gas in a2029 is in hydrostatic equilibrium out to a large radius .",
    "thus , a2029 is an ideal candidate for the determination of the total gravitational mass of the cluster at large radii using the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this requires that the gas temperature and density be determined as a function of radius the cluster .",
    "previous observations using the @xmath17 monitor proportional counter ( mpc ) found an average gas temperature of @xmath18 kev ( david et al .",
    "however , this observation does not provide any information on the distribution of temperatures .",
    "david et al .  ( 1995 ) derived the mass of a2029 from _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observations assuming that the gas was isothermal .",
    "this paper presents new _ asca _ x - ray spectra of a2029 .",
    "we use these spectra to constrain the temperature variation in the cluster .",
    "we also analyze archival _ rosat _ pspc observations of the x - ray image and spectrum of a2029 .",
    "we use the _ asca _ derived temperature gradients and _ rosat _ derived x - ray surface brightness to determine the variation of the total gravitational mass and gas mass with radius in the cluster . as a test of the hydrostatic assumption , we search for asymmetries in the the temperature distribution which would be indicative of recent dynamical activity , such as a subcluster merger .",
    "we also constrain any abundance gradients in the intracluster gas in the cluster . the use of _ asca _ spectra to determine the spatial variation of the spectral properties of the x - ray emitting gas in a2029 requires that the effects of the energy - dependent point spread function ( psf ) be corrected .",
    "this is particularly difficult when the x - ray surface brightness is strongly peaked to the cluster center , as is true in a2029 .",
    "a2029 contains a very strong cooling flow , which is centered on the large central cd galaxy ( ugc 9752 = ic 1101 ) .",
    "the presence of a cooling flow has been established based both on analyses of the x - ray surface brightness profile ( arnaud 1989 ; sarazin , oconnell , & mcnamara 1992 ) , and on analyses of the x - ray spectrum of the central cluster region ( white et al .",

    "the cluster was observed with _ asca _ on 1994 february 1920 .",
    "the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) detectors operated with two chips per detector being active ( s0c0,1 and s1c2,3 ) , and the observation included both bright and faint mode sis data .",
    "there were a number of problems with the attitude control during a portion of this observation , which resulted in the original standard attitude file being incorrect .",
    "for the first 1180 seconds of the integration , the attitude was about 20 arcmin off .",
    "we discarded this portion of data .",
    "the attitude settled into an accurate and steady value for the remainder of the observation .",
    "the gas imaging spectrometer detector 3 ( gis3 ) data was taken during the period when the events were recorded with a bit error .",
    "this error was corrected , although this data has fewer spectral channels as a result of this .",
    "the data were screened using relatively strict versions of the standard cleaning criteria . when these screening operations were complete , the exposures were 29,612 , 29,710 , 34,365 and 34,162 seconds for the sis0 , sis1 , gis2 , and gis3 , respectively .",
    "the sis and gis spectra were corrected for background using blank sky observations which were screened in the same manner as the data . for the gis",
    ", the background was constructed by weighting blank sky observations with differing values of the cut - off rigidity ( @xmath29 ) by the actual distribution of @xmath29 values during the screened exposure time . for the sis , a long observation with the same minimum cut - off rigidity ( @xmath30 ) was used . for the analysis of the spatial variation of the x - ray spectrum (   [ sec : spatial ] ) , we added a systematic uncertainty of 20% in the background to the other uncertainties in deriving confidence intervals for parameters .",
    "a2029 was observed with the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) for 3,236 seconds on 1992 january 24 ( observation wp800161 ; u. briel , p.i . ) and for 12,550 seconds on 1992 august 10 - 11 ( observation rp800249 ; c. jones , p.i . ) .",
    "the first observation was discussed previously in slezak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , while the second was presented in david et al .",
    "the two observations were combined , and were aligned using the positions of two bright point sources .",
    "the pspc data was screened for periods of high background based on a master veto rate @xmath31 170 ( plucinsky et al .",
    "1993 ) , for other times of high background based on the light curve of counts in the background region used for the extraction of the spectrum ( see below ) , for periods of 15 seconds after switching on the high voltage , and for periods with an uncertain aspect solution .",
    "the analysis of the pspc was done with a combination of the iraf / pros software , the xspec / xanadu software , the xselect program , and snowden s sxrb package for the analysis of diffuse x - ray emission ( snowden 1995 ) .",
    "the screened data contained a total exposure of 12,905 seconds and the average master veto rate was 87.05 .",
    "the data were corrected for particle background , scattered solar x - ray background , the long term enhancements ( lte ) in this background , and after - pulses . with these backgrounds",
    "removed , the image was corrected for exposure and vignetting .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc spectra and x - ray surface brightness profiles were corrected for background using four regions at radii from 24 to 44 arcmin which were free of strong sources or obstruction by the instrument ribs . because of calibration uncertainties at the softest and hardest energies , we restricted the pspc spectra to energies of 0.22.2 kev ( channels 6 - 32 ) .",
    "we fit the observed spectra with thermal emission models for a low density plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium . where possible , we used models based on both the raymond - smith code ( raymond & smith 1977 ) and the mekal code ( e.g. , kaastra et al .",
    "the mekal code includes a better treatment of the iron l lines near 1 kev , based on measurement and calculations of the atomic parameters by liedahl and his colleagues ( e.g. , liedahl et al .",
    "we did not fit mekal models during the spatial analysis of the spectra in   [ sec : spatial ] , as the mekal spectra were not available in a form which could be used with the programs employed to correct for the energy - dependent point - spread - function ( psf ) .",
    "however , at higher temperatures , we found that the raymond - smith and mekal spectra gave almost exactly the same results .",
    "larger differences are found between the raymond - smith and mekal spectra at lower temperatures , and these become more important when the spectrum includes the cooling flow regions at the center of the spectra .",
    "however , we still found that the spectral parameters from fitting raymond - smith and mekal models were in good agreement . because the mekal model generally gave slightly better fits , we report the results using this model in  ",
    "[ sec : global ] and [ sec : cflow ] .",
    "we considered two simple models for the thermal distribution of the gas in each region where the spectrum was extracted .",
    "the first model assumed thermal emission at a single temperature ; we refer to this as a `` single temperature '' model . in table  [",
    "tab : spectra ] , these models labeled as `` 1 t . '' this model is characterized by two spectral parameters , the temperature of the gas and the ratio of the abundances in the gas to the solar values , and by the overall emission integral of the gas which normalizes the spectra .    as discussed above",
    "(   [ sec : intro ] ) , there is considerable previous evidence from x - ray spectra and images for a cooling flow at the center of a2029 .",
    "thus , we also considered a simple spectral model for ambient gas and a cooling flow .",
    "the gas in the cooling flow was assumed to cool from the temperature of the ambient gas to very low temperatures due to its own radiation .",
    "the abundances in the cooling flow gas were taken to be those in the ambient gas , as expected if the cooling gas originated as intracluster gas .",
    "the cooling flow gas was assumed to cool at constant pressure ; more detailed spectral models have indicated that this is a reasonably accurate approximation ( wise & sarazin 1993 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of this cooling flow component is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the photon energy , @xmath34 is the luminosity emitted in the photon energy range @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the mean mass per particle in terms of the proton mass @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the ambient gas temperature in the cluster from which the gas is assumed to cool , @xmath39 is its current temperature , the emissivity of the gas per unit volume and photon energy is @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the mass density of the gas , and the total emissivity ( cooling rate ) of the gas is @xmath42 ( e.g. , wise & sarazin 1993 ) .",
    "we will refer to this model as the `` single temperature plus cooling flow model . '' in table  [ tab : spectra ] , these models labeled as `` cf . '' this model is characterized by a single additional parameter , the cooling rate @xmath43 .",
    "the global cluster x - ray spectrum ( [ sec : global ] ) and the spectrum of the inner cooling flow region (   [ sec : cflow ] ) were fit to these models using xspec version 9 .",
    "because this version of xspec did not contain a model for the cooling flow spectrum using the mekal emission code , we constructed such a model .",
    "the analysis of the spatial variation of the spectrum , correcting for the effects of the energy - dependent psf of _ asca _ , was done with the program of markevitch et al .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc data in the hard band of 0.5 to 2.0 kev ( pi channels 52 to 201 ) were used to construct an image of the region of the _ asca _ observation .",
    "this hard band is useful because it reduces the background in the image without much loss of counts from the hot intracluster gas .",
    "this image was corrected for particle and solar x - ray background , exposure , and vignetting as discussed above .",
    "the resulting image was adaptively smoothed with a variable smoothing kernel so that each smoothing beam had a signal to noise ratio of at least five ( huang & sarazin 1996 ) .",
    "contours of the x - ray surface brightness for the central portion of the resulting image are shown in figure  [ fig : pspc_image ] .",
    "2.7truein    0.2truein    the _ rosat _ pspc image of a2029 contains a large number of presumably unrelated point sources .",
    "there are two moderately strong point sources located approximately 4 arcmin ( src .",
    "a ) and 9 arcmin ( src .",
    "b ) from the center of the cluster . src .",
    "a is known to be a background active galaxy nucleus ( agn ; bregman , private communication ) .",
    "b has not been identified to our knowledge .",
    "these sources are labeled on figure  [ fig : pspc_image ] , and are discussed further in   [ sec : spatial ] , where they are included in the determination of the variation in the x - ray spectrum of a2029 .",
    "when these sources are removed , the contours of the x - ray surface brightness of a2029 in figure  [ fig : pspc_image ] appear elliptical and quite regular .",
    "this agrees with the previous conclusions reached by slezak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) using wavelet techniques applied to the shorter _ rosat _ pspc exposure , and by buote & tsai ( 1996 ) using the power ratio technique applied to the longer _ rosat _ pspc exposure .",
    "there is general agreement that a2029 is regular and that it lacks any strong substructure .",
    "this is also consistent with the tendency for clusters with large cooling flows to be regular ( e.g. , buote & tsai 1996 ) .",
    "the regularity of a2029 makes it a particularly attractive candidate for applying the hydrostatic method to determine the mass distribution .    at the faintest levels ,",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc observation shows x - ray emission from a2029 extending out to a radius of approximately 20 arcmin from the cluster center . in   [ sec : spatial ] , we will analyze the x - ray spectrum of a2029 out to a radius of 16 arcmin .",
    "all of this region is included in the fields of view of both of the gis detectors .",
    "however , the sis detectors only cover a fraction of the cluster emission . in figure",
    "[ fig : pspc_image ] , the dashed squares give the approximate fields of view of the two chips used on the sis0 detector ( s0c0 and s0c1 ) .",
    "the corresponding regions for the sis1 detector chips ( s1c2 and s1c3 ) are similar and have about the same orientation , but are displaced about 1 arcmin to the west .",
    "the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ observations were used to determine the integrated spectrum of the cluster . for this purpose",
    ", we determined the spectrum within 16@xmath24 ( @xmath1 mpc ) of the center of the cluster .",
    "this region is shown as the outermost dashed circle in figure  [ fig : pspc_slices ] .",
    "this region extends nearly to the bright ring of enhanced background near the edge of each of the _ asca _ gis detectors , and lies well within the ribs on _ rosat _ pspc detector . since the _ asca _ sis spectra cover only a portion of this region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pspc_image ] ) , we do not include the sis data in this determination of the global spectrum .",
    "later , we will find that the cluster has significant spatial variations in its x - ray spectrum , due to a cooling flow at the cluster center (   [ sec : cflow ] ) and due to a radial temperature gradient (   [ sec : spatial_t ] ) .",
    "thus , it would be difficult to directly compare the sis spectra with those from the gis and pspc , which cover the same larger region of the cluster .",
    "the spectra were binned to insure that there were at least 20 counts per spectral channel , so that the @xmath44 test gave reliable results .",
    "we excluded appropriately sized regions around each of the two point sources labeled a and b in figure  [ fig : pspc_image ] .",
    "the results of fitting `` single temperature '' and `` single temperature plus cooling flow '' models to the observed spectral are summarized in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "the first column enumerates the rows for reference in the text .",
    "the second column indicates the region of a2029 being considered , and the third column lists the instrument(s ) used .",
    "the fourth column gives the model being fit to the data .",
    "columns 58 give the galactic hydrogen absorbing column @xmath45 , the ambient gas temperature @xmath46 , the heavy element abundance , and the cooling rate ( the latter is only given for the cf models ) .",
    "column 9 gives the resulting @xmath44 and number of degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) for the best - fit model .",
    "the final column gives the probability that the value of @xmath44 would be this large if the data were drawn from the best - fit model with only statistical uncertainties .",
    "because it is likely that there are systematic errors in the responses of the instruments , these numbers may not be accurate .",
    "the uncertainties in the parameters give the 90% confidence region .    because of their nearly disjoint spectral bands , we find that the _ rosat _ pspc ( 0.22 kev ) and _ asca _ gis s ( 0.511 kev ) provide nearly orthogonal but complementary information of the spectrum of a2029 .",
    "we first discuss the results from _ rosat _ and _ asca _ separately , and then jointly fit all of the spectra .",

    "for the high ambient gas temperature in a2029 , the low energy band of _ rosat _ makes it relatively insensitive to changes in the temperature .",
    "moreover , at these high temperatures , the strongest spectral feature due to heavy elements is the 7 kev iron k line complex , which is beyond the band of _",
    "rosat_. on the other hand , the low energy band of the pspc does make it very sensitive to the galactic absorbing column .",
    "the absorbing column required by the pspc spectrum is consistent with the galactic value of @xmath26 @xmath10 ( stark et al .",
    "1992 ) . however , the temperature is lower than that given previously by the @xmath17 mpc ( @xmath18 kev ; david et al .",

    "( @xmath121 kev ; ",
    "[ sec : global_gis ] ) .",
    "an examination of the residuals for this single temperature fit suggested that the poor fit was due to additional soft x - ray emission .",
    "the poor fit of a single temperature spectrum to the pspc data and the previous evidence for a cooling flow at the center of the cluster suggest that a cooling flow component be added to the model spectrum . the best - fit single temperature plus cooling flow model",
    "is shown in the second row of table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "this provided a considerably improved fit ( a reduction of @xmath122 for one additional d.o.f . ) . in this model ,",
    "53% of the counts in the pspc spectrum come from the cooling flow component .",
    "because of the soft band of the pspc , the temperature of the gas is very poorly defined in this model . at the 90% confidence limit , only a lower limit on the temperature is determined . as noted before , varying the temperature has little effect on the soft x - ray spectrum in the single temperature model , and even less in the cooling flow model ( eq .",
    "[ eq : cflow ] ) .",
    "the reason for the latter is that most of the softer emission in the cooling flow model comes from gas at which has cooled to lower temperature , so that the integral in equation  ( [ eq : cflow ] ) is nearly independent of the upper limit temperature @xmath38 for @xmath123 .",
    "the abundance of heavy elements is also rather poorly determined by the single temperature plus cooling flow fit to spectrum , and only gives a lower limit .",
    "as noted above , the fe k lines can not be observed with _",
    "rosat _ to constrain the abundances .",
    "the cooling flow component does produce strong line features within the pspc band due to heavy elements , including the l lines of iron and the k lines of c , n , o , ne , and mg .",
    "however , the strengths of these lines are not strongly dependent on the abundance of the heavy elements , at least if they are all assumed to vary together and the abundance is not too low .",
    "the reason is that , at temperatures @xmath124 kev where these lines are strongest , heavy element line emission dominates the cooling of the gas .",
    "thus , if the abundances are increased , the line emission rate is increased but the cooling time is decreased by nearly the same factor . in equation  ( [ eq : cflow ] ) , increasing the abundance increases both @xmath125 in the numerator and @xmath126 in the denominator by approximately the same amount .",
    "on the other hand , the _ rosat _ pspc spectrum does give an excellent determination of the absorbing column , and a good determination of the cooling rate @xmath43 . as noted above , the absorbing column is reasonably close to the galactic value from stark et al .",
    "the cooling rate also agrees well with previous determinations ; we discuss this in more detail below (   [ sec : global_both ] ) .",

    "we did nt use the _ asca _ sis0 or sis1 spectra , because these instruments did not cover the entire region of the cluster ( figure  [ fig : pspc_image ] ) .",
    "later , we will find that the cluster has significant spatial variations in its x - ray spectrum , due to a cooling flow at the cluster center (   [ sec : cflow ] ) and due to a radial temperature gradient (   [ sec : spatial_t ] ) .",
    "thus , it would be difficult to directly compare the sis spectra with those from the gis and pspc , which cover the same larger region of the cluster .",
    "the results of fits to these spectra are summarized in rows 3 and 4 of table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "because of the hard energy band of the gis spectra , these observations have strengths and weaknesses which are the opposites of those of the _ rosat _ pspc .",
    "the gis provides accurate measures of the ambient gas temperature and the iron abundance , but do not usefully constrain the soft x - ray absorption or the cooling rate .",
    "these two spectra were fit first with the single temperature model .",
    "this gave an accurate determination of the temperature and of the iron abundance , but only an upper limit on the absorbing column .",
    "the fit was adequate , with a @xmath44 per d.o.f .",
    "because of the evidence for a cooling flow in a2029 , we also tried a fit which included a cooling flow .",
    "this provided only a marginal improvement in the fit ( @xmath127 for one extra fitting parameter ) , and accordingly , only an upper limit on the cooling rate .",
    "because of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of the the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ spectra , and the fact that the best - fit individual spectra gave consistent results ( table  [ tab : spectra ] ) , we determined the best - fit spectrum for the combined data sets of _ rosat _ pspc and _ asca _ gis2 and gis3 spectra .",
    "we allowed for a variation in the overall calibration between _",

    "also , the image regions were restricted to the area within @xmath131 of the center of each of the gis detectors .",
    "the observed _ asca _ x - ray spectra were accumulated within each image region . for a given set of spectral parameters for the model regions , we determined the predicted spectra in the image regions , including the detector response and the redistribution of photons among image regions by the energy - dependent _ asca _ psf .",
    "the parameter of the spectra in the model regions were varied until the best - fit model ( minimum @xmath44 ) for the observed spectra in the image regions was found .",
    "an annealing technique ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) was used to avoid false minima .",
    "we were careful to use spectral bins which were large enough that the gaussian approximation to poisson uncertainties was valid , so that the @xmath44 test could be applied .",
    "the energy - dependent _ asca _ psf was approximated by interpolation between gis images of cyg x-1 taken at various locations in the focal plane ( takahashi 1995 ) .",

    "the lower energy cutoff should not affect the determinations of the high temperatures found for the gas . excluding lower energies",

    "a relative systematic psf uncertainty ( 5% for circularly symmetric image regions , 15% for other region shapes ) was added to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the instrumental contributions to the psf are different for the sis and gis .",
    "for modeling of the sis data , the gis cyg x-1 calibration images were corrected for the energy dependence of the intrinsic gis detector blurring by additional smoothing resulting in a final constant resolution ( gaussian @xmath132 ) .",
    "the cluster sis data also were smoothed to the same resolution .    because of its superior spatial resolution , the _ rosat _ pspc image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pspc_image ] ) was used to determine the distribution of projected emission measure within the cluster .",
    "errors due to photon statistics and the background correction in the _ rosat _ pspc image where included in the spectral analysis . at each step in the iteration to find the best - fit _ asca _ spectra , the spectrum in each model region was used to determine the emission within the band of the _ rosat _ pspc image including the _ rosat _ pspc response , and the surface brightness in the pspc image was converted into a distribution of emission measure on the sky . because there is some uncertainty in the overall _ rosat _ to _ asca _ calibration , we allow this to vary , and only use the _ rosat _ pspc image to fix the relative emission measure variation across the sky .",
    "this emission measure distribution and the spectral parameters were used to determine the predicted _ asca _ spectra within the image regions , including the redistribution by the psf . because a small miss - alignment of the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ images can affect the spectral fit , it is important to align the _",

    "we did this , but we also vary the offset between the two satellite data sets , and include an estimate of the resulting uncertainties in the alignment on our spectral fits .",
    "the use of the _ rosat _ pspc image to constrain the emission measure distribution in the _ asca _ only works well if the same spectral component provides the bulk of the emission in these two disjoint spectral bands ( 0.52.0 kev for the _ rosat _ image , and 2.511 kev for the _ asca _ data ) .",
    "this is probably a reasonable assumption in the outer parts of a2029 , but not in the inner cooling flow region . there",
    ", most of the _ rosat _ photons come from cooling gas , while much of the _ asca _ spectrum is contributed by hotter , ambient gas . to avoid errors due to this , we free the normalization of the central _ asca _ spectrum relative to the outer regions during the spectral fitting .",
    "two bright x - ray point sources are seen on the _ rosat _ pspc image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pspc_image ] ) at about 4 and 9 arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "a region around each of these sources was excluded from the _ asca _ cluster spectra .",
    "however , because of the broad _ asca _ psf , some emission from each of these point sources may be included in the adjoining cluster image regions .",

    "( thermal spectra were found to provide poorer fits than power - law spectra . )",
    "we found that contamination from these sources only has a small effect on the derived spectral properties of the cluster regions except for the outermost cluster regions .",

    "in fact , the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ fluxes of source a ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pspc_image ] ) agree within the uncertainties when corrected for the different spectral bands , but source b is about 3 times fainter in the _ asca _ observation than in the _ rosat _ data .",
    "the photon power - law indices of sources a and b were @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , in the best - fit models .",
    "the uncertainties in derived spectral quantities are 90% confidence regions from 200 monte carlo simulations of fitting the data with random statistical and systematic uncertainties added .",
    "the radial temperature variation in a2029 was determined by accumulating the _ asca _ sis and gis spectra in four adjoining annuli with boundary radii of 0 , 1.5 , 5 , 10 , and 16 arcmin .",
    "the outer radius of the outermost model annulus was taken to be 20 arcmin .",

    "even when we freed the normalization of this region ( i.e. , no longer set the normalization of this region relative to the others from the _ rosat _ pspc image ) , the fit was only improved very slightly .",

    "first , this was a much worse fit to the spectra .",
    "based on the f - test and the simulations of the uncertainties in the fits , this isothermal fit can be rejected at the @xmath31 96% confidence level .",

    ", this implies that there is a very large correction for scattering of the central emission in the fe k line spectra of the outer regions .",

    "as has generally been found with cooling flows clusters ( e.g. , jones & forman 1984 ) , the beta model does not fit the sharply peaked central surface brightness within the cooling radius .",

    ", we will use this fit to describe the gas distribution .",
    "we adopt the linear fit to the radial temperature in the gas derived from the _ asca _ spectra ( eq .  [ eq : t_linear ] ) . assuming the abundances of the heavy elements are 0.40 of the solar value , which was the best - fit abundance for the global cluster spectrum",

    "the fraction of the total cluster mass which is due to the intracluster gas is rising steeply with radius at the largest radii .",

    "we have analyzed the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ pspc x - ray observations of the rich cluster abell 2029 .",
    "the _ asca _ gis and _ rosat _ pspc are in good agreement on the global x - ray spectrum , and give an average ambient gas temperature of @xmath70 kev ( including the effects of a cooling flow ) . if the gas temperature is assumed to be constant in the analysis of the spatially resolved _",

    "the global x - ray spectra , central x - ray spectra , and _ rosat _ surface brightness all require a cooling flow at the cluster center .",

    "one concern with modeling the cooling flow spectrum and absorption in a2029 is that the _ asca _ sis and _ rosat _ pspc spectra do not appear to be consistent .",
    "this may indicate that there are calibration problems with the _ asca _ sis spectra at low energies .",
    "the pspc image shows that the cluster is elliptical , but is very regular and smooth .",
    "this agrees with previous analyses of the optical and x - ray distribution of the cluster ( slezak et al .",
    "1994 ; david et al .  1995 ; buote & tsai 1996 ) .",
    "we also find that there is no significant evidence for any irregularities in the temperature distribution in the cluster , as would be produced by a subcluster merger .",
    "structure in the x - ray surface brightness and particularly the gas temperature distribution has been interpreted as evidence for mergers and other hydrodynamic activity in many other clusters ( e.g. , henry & briel 1995 ; markevitch et al .",
    "1996,1997 ) .",
    "the lack of structure in the x - ray properties of a2029 suggests that the cluster is relaxed and that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we use the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium to determine the gravitational mass of the cluster as a function of radius . within a spherical radius of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 mpc ) ,",

    "the gas fraction of the cluster at this radius is @xmath169 , and the gas fraction is is increasing with radius at the largest radii .",
