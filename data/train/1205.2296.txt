    "there are well recognised and long - standing difficulties in describing high - mass star formation as a simple scaled - up version of the low - mass case ( eg kahn 1974 , shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) .",
    "radiation pressure is sufficient to prevent further accretion once fusion commences in the stellar core , preventing the formation of a star much more massive than 20@xmath3 in the simple low mass theory .",
    "this led to alternative models of high - mass star formation being suggested ( e.g.  bonnell , vine & bate 2004 , stahler , palla & ho 2000 , mckee & tan 2003 ) which can generally be subdivided into two groups : those that overcome the mass limit by forming massive stars through competitive accretion in dense cluster cores and those that look for a working version of the scaled - up low - mass star formation paradigm , essentially overcoming the pressure from the star through self - shielded disc accretion .",
    "dynamical models of disc accretion around massive stars are now being produced which appear to overcome the mass limit ( eg krumholz et al .",
    "2009 who model the formation of a 40@xmath3 star , and kuiper et al .",
    "2010 who find radiation pressure is not an efficient means of preventing disc accretion even in very massive stars ) .",
    "such models are therefore currently favoured as the most likely .",
    "this agrees with limited observational data , where infrared interferometry has revealed disk - like structures ( eg .  kraus et al .",
    "however we still have little direct evidence for accretion in a large sample of young massive stars .    the obvious alternative method to apply to a large sample",
    "is to look for kinematical evidence of a disc .",
    "the 2.3@xmath2 m co first overtone rotation - vibration emission is believed to mostly arise in an accretion disc in young stars ( eg , carr 1989 , chandler , carlstrom & scoville 1995 , bik & thi 2004 , blum et al .",
    "2004 , wheelwright et al .",
    "2010 , davies et al .",
    "the physical conditions required for its origin are characteristic of the properties of a disc that is self - shielded ( temperature in the range 10005000k , density greater than 10@xmath4@xmath5 ) , since it allows for the presence of molecular gas relatively near the exciting star . generally , the spectra of objects studied in this way have been better fitted by a disc model than other alternatives .",
    "however not all massive young stellar objects show co bandhead emission ( eg porter , drew & lumsden 1998 ) .",
    "there are many reasons why this might be , but the most plausible are that the accretion rate may simply be too low to give detectable emission , or , there may be too little column density to create the self - shielding condition required in the disc to prevent the intense uv flux from more massive stars reaching the mid - plane and destroying the co. the co bandhead is also relatively complex to interpret without high signal - to - noise data ( eg wheelwright et al ) because of the blending of the multiple rotational transitions that make up the @xmath6 vibrational transition .",
    "another complicating factor in high mass stars is that other emission mechanisms are also likely to be present .",
    "the most obvious of these is a stellar wind which can clearly be seen in at least some massive young stellar objects ( eg drew , bunn & hoare 1993 , bunn , drew & hoare 1995 , the models presented by sim , drew & long 2005 , and see section 3.2 ) .",
    "a powerful stellar wind is a fairly natural consequence of a high accretion rate in any hot star system .",
    "winds in young stars are usually traced by recombination lines of common elements , particularly hydrogen and helium ( eg simon et al .",
    "1983 and persson et al .",
    "1984 at moderate spectral resolution , and bunn , drew and hoare 1995 at high enough resolution to fully sample the line profiles ) .",
    "these lines can also be excited in nebular gas and in a disc as well .",
    "an ideal study should combine tracers sensitive to the winds as well as those that sample density and temperature and ionisation ranges more typical of an accretion disc in order to clearly distinguish the origin of the emission .",
    "therefore we need a transition that is only strongly excited at the higher densities seen in circumstellar discs around young stellar objects ( eg @xmath7@xmath5 ) .",
    "fortunately , there are other similar well studied situations from which we can draw likely candidates .",
    "for example , spectra of both active galactic nuclei ( eg baldwin et al 2004 ) and classical be stars ( zorec et al .  2007 ) show fluorescent fe@xmath8 emission consistent with an origin in a disc .",
    "it is not seen in ordinary nebular gas ( eg as in an hii region : see , for example , lumsden & puxley 1996 ) .",
    "feii emission straddles the boundary between where co emission might still arise ( neutral material ) and ionised material since its ionisation potential is only 7.9ev , with fe@xmath9 having an ionisation potential of 16.2ev .",
    "carciofi & bjorkman ( 2006 ) have successfully modelled the origin of this emission in be star disks from an origin in the shielded material near the disk mid - plane .",
    "accretion discs around young stars are likely to have additional opacity due to dust , but a similar partially ionised zone will exist within them .",
    "fluorescent excitation typically occurs when an atom / ion is irradiated by either uv continuum or lyman series photons .",
    "the excited atom / ion cascades back down to the ground state , leading to transitions that would not typically be seen from the standard recombination process .",
    "the optical feii lines have been well studied and modelled in both active galaxies and be stars ( eg baldwin et al .",
    "2004 ; carciofi & bjorkman 2006 ) but there are also infrared transitions that are more suitable for studying heavily embedded young stellar objects .",
    "in particular there are two strong lines near 1.6@xmath2 m ( eg see the spectrum of @xmath10 carina in hamann et al .",
    "1994 ) , of which the transition at 1.6877808@xmath2 m is both in a region of good atmospheric transmission , and near enough in wavelength to the hi br11 line that both can be compared without the need to worry about differential extinction .",
    "the 1.6877808@xmath2 m c@xmath11f@xmath12z@xmath11f@xmath12 transition arises from an upper level 6.2ev above the ground state ( johansson 1978 ) and is likely to be pumped by ly@xmath13 in situations just such as we are seeking ( the dense ionised / neutral boundary ) as discussed by johansson & letokhov ( 2007 ) .",
    "previous observations ( porter et al .",
    "1998 ) indicate this particular line may be relatively common in massive young stellar objects , and more prevalent there than in lower mass objects ( hamann & persson 1992 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper therefore is straightforward .",
    "we have observed a small sample of eight intermediate and high mass young stellar objects with sufficient spectral resolution to resolve the kinematics of the line emission in both feii and hi recombination lines for the first time . the bulk of this sample have near and/or mid - infrared interferometric data available , allowing plausible limits to be placed on the inclination of the system and the size of any infrared emitting region in a disc .",
    "the comparison of both feii and hi tracers is ideal for testing whether the feii samples a different emission region from the hi recombination lines .",
    "the sample is therefore ideal for testing the value of the feii line as a disc tracer , as well as expanding on the use of hi lines as studied previously ( eg bunn et al 1995 ) to those present in the @xmath14 band .",
    "our work presents a velocity resolved study of the higher brackett series members 114 and 124 for the first time .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the sample and the observations made , in section 3 we discuss the observational results together with some simple model fits to our data and in section 4 we sum up the evidence as to which features might be the best kinematical tracers of discs or winds around young massive stars .    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      the fluorescent feii emission is a clear tracer of emission from a disk in classical be stars ( carciofi & bjorkman 2006 ) .",
    "detailed models have been derived for observations of the optical feii lines in be stars ( eg arias et al 2007 ) , showing that even quite complex line profiles can be explained in terms of emission from a relatively narrow ring .",
    "it therefore seems natural to consider whether a disc model can explain these relatively younger objects .",
    "currently , the 1.688@xmath2 m feii line is not yet included in any radiative transfer model . nor",
    "do we understand its source function well enough , given its potential origin as a laser ( johansson & letokhov 2007 ) , to reliably model even in the fashion of arias et al .",
    "we therefore rule out detailed calculations at this point , and leave that to future work .",
    "instead , we adopt a `` proof of concept approach '' and attempt to fit the observed line profiles with a simple accretion disc model but without a detailed source function for the line emission , or attempting to enforce a correct temperature structure for the emission zone .",
    "specifically , we use the constraints given by other observations to fix the mass of the star and the inclination ( as quoted in table [ properties ] ) , and then test how well a disc can fit the observed line profile .",
    "the model in question consists of a keplerian disc within which the line flux per unit area is proportional to the local surface density .",
    "the structure of the rotating disc is given by the standard @xmath13-disc model  as described by , eg , pringle ( 1981 ) .",
    "the accretion rate and value of @xmath13 are not fitted in this process , since the model is being fitted to a normalised line profile , and thus the actual surface density is unimportant . furthermore , the variation of surface density with radius is insensitive to both @xmath13 and the accretion rate . as a result , the only free parameters are the intrinsic line width and the outer radius of the emitting area .",
    "the latter is poorly constrained for most of the objects however since they exhibit single peaked emission .",
    "in that instance the outer radius is a lower limit set by the model line width , since we clearly can not constrain this parameter strongly in the case of a near face - on inclination .",
    "turbulent line broadening is added to the disc model in order to achieve the final fits .",
    "this is represented by a gaussian , and the width is given in table [ feii_fits ] .",
    "no other line broadening mechanism is considered as we do not expect any to occur  even thermal broadening is likely to be insignificant for iron .",
    "indeed , as noted by johansson and letokhov ( 2007 ) , the conditions under which this feii line is emitted are likely to lead to mild lasing , which actually narrows the natural line profile .",
    "we also do not expect the opacity in this transition to be significant .",
    "the model is used to determine the line profiles for a given set of input parameters .",
    "the model profiles are then smoothed to the instrumental resolution , before being compared to the observed profiles . to find the best fitting profiles ,",
    "the outer radius and line width are allowed to vary between 1100au and 175kms@xmath1 respectively and the powell method ( as implemented in ) is used to minimize the residual of the fit .",
    "we present a comparison of the best fitting model profiles and the data in figure [ fe_ii_line_prof ] . a detailed case - by - case discussion of the best - fitting parameters is deferred to the next section , but it is clear that , in general , the observed feii 1.688@xmath2 m line profiles can be modelled by emission from circumstellar discs of an appropriate size . the major exception to this is s106 irs , which we discuss in detail in section [ s106comments ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that gl  490 , mwc  297 and mwc  349a also appear similar in feii and br12 if we ignore the broad br12 line wings .",
    "a disc model can also partly explain the br12 emission in all of these sources as discussed below , consistent with the results from fitting the iron line .",
    "a disc model does not fit the hi lines from the other sources well at all .",
    "the h@xmath13 line in this source shows an asymmetric double peak ( vink et al .",
    "2002 ) , closer to line self - absorption than to evidence for a rotating disk .",
    "the velocity separation between the peaks is @xmath16120kms@xmath1 , compared to only about @xmath17kms@xmath1 as seen in our br@xmath18 spectrum .",
    "this is also consistent with the self - absorption picture since we would expect h@xmath13 to be more optically thick at velocities near , and to the blue of , systemic compared to br12 if a dense wind is present ( as is evidenced by figure [ fig3a ] ) .",
    "eisner et al .  (",
    "2003 ) find an inner radius of 0.73au from modelling their continuum interferometric data with a flat dusty disc .",
    "any disc within this radius must be dust - free .",
    "vink et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that their h@xmath13 polarisation data can be explained by a straightforward line depolarisation effect , where the continuum light is scattered by a small scale disc , whereas the emission line itself arises on scales larger than the disc , likely in a wind .",
    "the small scale disc could be the extension of the dusty disc detected by eisner et al .",
    "down to the star .",
    "the line wing / peak ratio is roughly the same for br@xmath18 and h@xmath13 , but larger for br12 ( cf figure [ fig3a ] ) , suggestive of stark broadening .",
    "the line wings can be fitted equally well by both a power - law , with exponent @xmath19 , and an exponential ( figure [ br12_fits ] ) .",
    "we also explicitly fitted the castor et al ( 1970 ) model .",
    "a formally good fit is achieved , but the key parameters in this case , the width of the line core , the electron temperature ( width ) and opacity , are highly degenerate .",
    "effectively there is little difference between a very broad intrinsic line and a highly scattered one .",
    "peak ratio for the br12 and br@xmath18 data , and the closeness of the power - law exponent to the canonical @xmath20 , both suggest that stark broadening is present however .",
    "the feii emission in this object is not fitted perfectly by a disc model , but the profile is clearly very different from the brackett lines . in this instance",
    "it is plausible that the hydrogen lines arise in a large scale wind , whereas the feii is mostly tracing the inner disk .",
    "schreyer et al .  ( 2006 ) detect a relatively large - scale ( @xmath21au ) molecular disc in approximate keplerian rotation from which they derive an inclination of @xmath22 .",
    "the position angle for this disc is the same as that found at 2 cm by campbell , persson & mcgregor ( 1986 ) , and both lie orthogonal to the direction of the observed large scale molecular outflow observed by mitchell et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , similar to other equatorial wind systems ( eg hoare 2006 ) .",
    "oudmaijer , drew & vink ( 2005 ) also inferred the presence of a small scale disc from near infrared spectropolarimetry .",
    "oudmaijer et al .",
    "did however require the initial line emitting material to lie internal to the scattering disc , and that the disc did not extend down to the stellar surface .",
    "our br12 profile looks very similar to the br@xmath18 profile in bunn et al .",
    "bunn et al .",
    "also infer a relatively flat br@xmath13/br@xmath18 ratio in gl  490 out to velocities @xmath23kms@xmath1 , before an upturn is seen .",
    "however , the evidence for a turn - up in these earlier cgs4 data may be compromised by poorer continuum subtraction , since the data were taken with a smaller array and at lower spectral resolution , spatial resolution and free spectral range .",
    "comparison of our br12 profile with the br@xmath18 and br@xmath13 profiles in bunn et al .",
    "suggests that the broad line wings are relatively stronger in br12 which slightly favours stark broadening .",
    "there is a good fit to the castor et al model for br 12 as well , and in this instance the parameters are well defined with @xmath24 and @xmath25k .",
    "the very low value of the electron temperature implied by the fit is a concern , but we do not have sufficient signal - to - noise to determine if the wings extend further in velocity .",
    "the line wings do not follow the expected power law for stark broadening either , having an exponent of only @xmath26 . in this instance , the relatively poor signal - to - noise prevents a truly firm conclusion .",
    "the brackett lines differ from the feii line largely in a strong red asymmetry , and stronger evidence for broad line wings in the hydrogen lines .",
    "the feii emission can be successfully fitted with a keplerian disc .",
    "the inferred lower limit to the outer radius is much smaller than the size of the structure seen in the radio map which is several hundred au across .",
    "given the similarity of the line core in this object between br12 and feii it is possible that a disc may be a suitable explanation for the hydrogen line emission as well , especially given the orientation of the radio emission .",
    "there is no self - absorption in any of the lines observed either here or in bunn et al .",
    "so there is no requirement for a strict wind component to be present .",
    "m17sw irs1 is a young binary star located just beyond the edge of the m17 hii region and is also known as the kleinmann - wright object ( kleinmann & wright 1973 ) .",
    "estimates of its luminosity range from about 5000  ( chini et al .  2004 ) to 50000  ( follert et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the latter is more consistent with the presence of hei 2.058@xmath2 m emission as reported by both porter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and hanson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the deredenned flux ratio is very similar to that presented by bunn , drew & hoare , and as noted by them is rather similar to that for bd+40@xmath154124 .",
    "br@xmath18 does show weak red asymmetric self - absorption which might suggest the presence of infalling ionised gas .",
    "the br12 and feii emission have very different profiles , again in a similar fashion to bd+40@xmath154124 .",
    "the feii data can be explained by a disc , at both a near edge - on inclination as measured by follert et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , as well as nearer to face - on ( cf table [ feii_fits ] ) .",
    "however , an edge - on disc requires a very large spread in the feii emission region , almost out to the full extent of the mid infrared emission region seen by follert et al . without further information however we can not rule out either possibility .",
    "the degeneracy between inclination and outer radius of disc is of course a well known problem in this situation , but m17sw irs1 is the only source in which the result of fixing the inclination at the value given in table [ properties ] leads to results that are then difficult to interpret in light of other data .",
    "the most likely model for this source is the same as discussed for bd+40@xmath154124 , namely a disc giving rise to the feii emission and a wind the brackett line emission .",
    "the wings on br12 are relatively weak in this source , but the power law profile of the wing is @xmath27 , suggesting that stark broadening may be present . a formally good fit to the castor et al model can be achieved but the values of both opacity and electron temperature are again highly degenerate with the core line width , and no meaningful physical parameters can be obtained .",
    "the br12 line in m8e is best described as a relatively narrow gaussian superposed on a much broader `` pedestal '' .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the br@xmath13 and br@xmath18 profiles in bunn , drew & hoare .",
    "the line core is similar to br@xmath18 , but the higher velocity line wings are less evident .",
    "br@xmath13 has broad wings but the profiles are not a match .",
    "it is possible the greater wavelength coverage of the data presented here may partially explain this difference .",
    "it can not be explained easily with simple line broadening mechanisms outlined in section [ hydrogen ] since there is no simple trend with quantum number @xmath28 .",
    "an exponential fit is a better match to the broad wings than a power - law , and the latter also has a very low exponent of @xmath29 .",
    "neither matches at the highest velocities however .",
    "the castor et al model is formally a very poor fit .",
    "one other notable aspect of our data is that the line centre velocity of the brackett lines are significantly offset with respect to systemic . as shown by table [ simplefits ] ,",
    "these lines have @xmath30kms@xmath1 , whereas the feii line has @xmath31kms@xmath1 , which is in agreement with the measured molecular gas value , and the br@xmath13 and br@xmath18 data of bunn et al .",
    "the fact that both br11 and br12 lines agree in velocity rules out a simple wavelength error in part of the data since they are observed in different echelle settings .",
    "bunn et al .",
    "infer a relatively flat br@xmath13/br@xmath18 optically thick ratio in m8e out to velocities @xmath23kms@xmath1 , with only weak , if any , evidence of a turn - up at higher velocity .",
    "the feii line can be modelled by a disc , but the relatively weak line emission is noisy and hence does not particularly constrain other models .",
    "linz et al .  ( 2009 ) can only set an upper limit on the size of the disc in the mid - infrared of @xmath16100au , which is consistent with our feii disc model .",
    "the similarity of the core of the br12 line and the feii line , if we ignore the velocity offset mentioned above , suggests both have a common origin .",
    "overall though the difference in velocity , the unusual `` pedestal '' on br12 and the fact that the line widths do not simply scale with @xmath28 all make it difficult to ascribe an origin to the emission .",
    "the inclination of this source is the subject of debate .",
    "drew et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find a near edge - on inclination is necessary to explain the observed optical absorption line data , since otherwise the star is near break - up velocity .",
    "by contrast all of the interferometry data is best modelled by a near face - on orientation instead . an edge - on model is also more likely to lead to double - peaked line profiles if an ionised disc is a contributor . for consistency with the other objects studied here , where we have adopted inclinations from interferometric data , we do the same here .",
    "the br@xmath13/br@xmath18 ratio presented in murdoch & drew ( 1994 ) is similar to the br@xmath18/br12 ratio of bd+40@xmath154124 or m17sw irs1 shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",

    "the opacity to thomson scattering is greater than unity , so the conditions on the actual model are not met .",
    "the implied electron temperature is also very low ( @xmath36k ) and not physically meaningful .",
    "the match of the castor et al profile in a case where the intrinsic line core itself is very narrow does argue for scattering being the dominant mechanism , but that this model itself is insufficient to accurately estimate key physical parameters related to the scattering .",
    "if we accept a mostly face - on inclination for this source then our feii profile can be fitted well by a disc model , with an outer radius that is well within the extent of the ionised gas as seen in the radio map .",

    "( 2011 ) as well ( which otherwise reach a very similar conclusion to malbet et al ) .",
    "however the relatively clear evidence for significant scattering in the line wings largely reduces this problem . in a face - on orientation , the lack of a clear line effect in the spectropolarimetry of oudmaijer & drew ( 1999 ) is not significant , since an asymmetry in the source structure as seen on the sky is required to give rise to such a signature , and this is naturally not present . a counter argument to this is that weigelt et al .",

    "this is clear in our feii disc fit , which formally is very poor .",
    "however , this is mostly due to a weak blue - red asymmetry in the observed data , which can not be modelled within the context of our very simple prescription .",
    "kraus et al .  ( 2000 ) also had some difficulty in fitting the v=20 co bandhead with a keplerian disc profile .",
    "a disc is clearly present in this source , however , given the maser emission .",
    "it may simply be that the disc is not completely keplerian as also suggested by the maser observations of weintroub et al .",
    "danchi et al .  (",
    "2001 ) derived an outer radius of about 50au from near - infrared interferometry , consistent with what we find from modelling the feii data , and the origin of the mm / sub - mm masers ( thum et al .",
    "1994 ) , though all are rather larger discs than the best fit that kraus et al .",
    "find for their disc model .",
    "the hi br@xmath18 profile also appears very similar to that shown in hamann and simon ( 1986 ) , and shows what is likely to be weak blue self - absorption or a very asymmetric disk .",
    "the broad wings can again be ascribed to electron scattering ( meyer et al .",
    "2002 ) , in agreement with the spectropolarimetry of oudmaijer et al .",
    "the hydrogen lines have generally been interpreted as the combination of emission from a slow stellar wind and a rotating disc ( eg hamann & simon , 1986 , 1988 ) .",
    "this wind must be on larger scales than the disc modelled by danchi et al .",
    ", since otherwise the velocities would be anomalously low .",
    "another possibility is a disc - wind since the low expansion velocity evident in the hydrogen lines naturally arises in a model where the wind is launched from the disc at some distance from the star ( eg gordon 2003 , hollenbach et al 1994 , sim et al .  2005 ) .",
    "the br@xmath18/br12 line ratio plot shows a distinctive pattern different from any of either our sources or those presented in bunn et al .",
    "it is however consistent with self - absorption in the lines due to an outflowing wind in the sense that the opacity increases uniformly towards the blue .",
    "we also considered the ratio after the individual line profiles had been cross - correlated , in order to compensate for any residual velocity calibration errors that might be present , which could have an effect here given the steepness of the profile .",
    "the result shows a slightly flatter line ratio , but still with a distinct slope in the same sense as shown here .",
    "kraus et al .  found that the high series pfund lines were singly peaked with widths @xmath38kms@xmath1 .",
    "this suggests these lines arise in optically thin gas far from the star in the disc - wind , or in the nebula .",
    "however such a large scale optically thin pfund component should be reflected in both the balmer and brackett lines as well , and is not .",
    "the mid infrared interferometry presented by quirrenbach , albrecht & tubbs ( 2006 ) also shows the high excitation mid infrared hydrogen lines are less extended than the dust continuum emission .",
    "instead the pfund and higher series lines must , on energetic grounds , arise near the central source , and the single peaked nature implies optically thin , approximately spherical , wind emission .",
    "it is probable therefore that the infrared recombination lines largely arise from a combination of disc - wind and spherical wind .",
    "s106 irs is the exciting star of the sh 2 - 106 hii region ( see , eg , saito et al .",
    "the hii region is best modelled as a bipolar flow which is almost oriented in the plane of the sky ( eg solf & carsenty 1982 ) .",
    "s106 irs has a variety of reported extinction values in the literature .",
    "the value given in table [ properties ] is from a fit to the silicate absorption spectrum as measured by iso in a large beam ( van den ancker et al .",
    "2000 ) which will be dominated by the emission from s106  irs .",
    "the fits to the co bandhead by chandler et al .",
    "( 1995 ) shows that a disc of radius 12au is likely to be present .",
    "the br@xmath18 and feii lines in s106 irs are remarkably similar ( figure [ fig2 g ] ) , though br@xmath18 has a larger fwzi than the feii line .",
    "perhaps the greatest surprise is that despite the near edge - on nature of this source , a disc model is a very poor fit ( figure [ fe_ii_line_prof ] ) .",
    "we observed the feii line in s106 irs at two epochs separated by 378 days .",
    "the data shown in figure [ fig2 g ] are the average of these observations .",
    "there was no evidence that the hi br11 line varied between these observations but there is some tentative evidence of a change in the feii line .",
    "this is shown in figure [ s106-epoch ] where we plot the data from the two epochs , after slight smoothing to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "there is a clear dip in the data at the velocity of maximum absorption for the second epoch .",
    "we can understand both the line profile and the variability if the feii line in this case does arise in a clumpy ( hence variable ) wind .",
    "the remaining differences in the line profile between the br12 and feii line then are due largely to the differing opacities in the two lines .",
    "we already know that s106 irs shows strong p - cygni absorption in the hei 2@xmath39s2@xmath39p transition at 2.058@xmath2 m ( drew et al.1993 ) , indicative of a stellar wind with a high mass loss rate ( see also felli et al .  1984 ) .",
    "the br@xmath18/br12 ratio plot for this source is similar to the br@xmath13/br@xmath18 ratio presented in drew et al .",
    "( 1993 ) but with better signal - to - noise at high velocity . drew et al .",
    "found an upturn at @xmath40kms@xmath1 in their br@xmath13/br@xmath18 ratio , which they interpret as evidence that br@xmath18 is becoming optically thin .",
    "however we see no such evidence . drew et al",
    ".  tried to deblend the prominent 5@xmath41g-4@xmath42d hei line from br@xmath13 at around this wavelength , whereas we have not done the same for the 2.16475@xmath2 m 7@xmath43g4@xmath43f hei lines which may explain the difference , though it should in theory enhance the up - turn in our data and suppress it in theirs .",
    "we therefore accept our line ratio as indicative for the source as a whole . a broadening mechanism is therefore required to explain the line wings as in other sources .",
    "the br12 wings have a power law profile with exponent @xmath44 , similar to the case of bd+40@xmath154124 .",
    "an exponential or the castor et al model give a slightly poorer fit . since our castor et al model",
    "does not match the central absorption we do not consider the fitting parameters further for this source .",
    "the enhanced wings seen in the brackett lines appear more prominently in br12 than br@xmath13 however , more suggestive of stark broadening .",
    "an almost unresolved nebular core further complicates the picture for our br@xmath18/br12 ratio .",
    "the nebular line arises from a much larger volume than the rest of the emission , and should have a lower extinction correction applied since the hii region is optically visible .",
    "this explains why the ratio plotted in figure [ fig3d ] exceeds the nominal case b value .",
    "overall most of the lines in this source can be explained by a dense wind ( as in drew et al .",
    "2003 ) which must be primarily along the equatorial direction to avoid veiling the nebula from the star . in this instance",
    ", the feii emission may also arise from the disc - wind , given the asymmetric wind - like profile it has .",
    "blake & boogert ( 2004 ) observed the m band fundamental co transition in this source .",
    "their results show a clear double peaked profile which they model as a disc with @xmath45 , consistent with the interferometry of eisner et al .",
    "notably the blue peak of their co profile is enhanced with a narrow emission component in the same fashion as our feii profile .",
    "this is suggestive of a localised spot of enhanced emission , which must have an origin in a source with constant velocity ( ie not the disc ) , since our data and the blake & boogert data are separated by 23 years .",
    "we do not quite resolve the blue and red peak in this source despite the almost edge - on nature .",
    "the disc model fits well despite this if we ignore the extra `` spike '' .",
    "notably , eisner et al .  ( 2003 ) suggest that a disc of similarly small size is present in their interferometry , though they favour one with a puffed up inner geometry .",
    "pontopiddan , blake & smette ( 2011 ) model the co as arising at 3.5au , outside the emission region for the @xmath46-band continuum .",
    "vv ser is observed to have a disk shadow , consistent with this modelling ( see discussion in pontopiddan et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the h@xmath13 profile is asymmetric double peaked ( reipurth , pedrosa & lago , 1996 ) with a velocity separation of 250kms@xmath1 between the red and blue peaks , again suggestive of a weak p - cygni profile .",
    "our data lack such obvious p - cygni effects , but the ratio shown in figure [ fig3e ] is otherwise similar to most of the other objects .",
    "an exponential fit to the line wings is marginally preferred .",
    "a power - law fit gives an exponent that is again rather shallow at @xmath47 .",
    "the line wings are stronger relative to the peak in the lower series lines for vv ser ( eg figure 3(e ) ) , which is suggestive of a scattering origin as well .",
    "the castor et al model gives a formally good fit but the opacity and electron temperature are effectively undefined in the result as was the case for other sources due to degeneracy in the best fitting model .",
    "a larger wavelength coverage would perhaps have helped identify the source of the broad line wings in this source .",
    "a wind origin for the remaining hydrogen emission seems likely given the very different br12 and feii profiles , with the latter almost certainly coming from a disc ( figure [ fig2h ] ) .",
    "our results show clearly that a wide variety of physical environments can be traced using near infrared spectral lines .",
    "it is clear that the combination of hi , feii and , where available , hei lines can help to disentangle the otherwise complex line profiles observed .",
    "hydrogen line ratios are particularly powerful in showing the need for a line broadening mechanism in all objects expect mwc  349 .",
    "specifically , data with sufficient spectral resolution _ and _ wavelength coverage allowed us to identify a likely origin in stark broadening in the wings of hydrogen lines in bd+40@xmath154124 , m17sw irs and s106 irs , and electron scattered wings in mwc  297 , and probably vv ser .",
    "better signal - to - noise , as available with larger telescopes , and an even larger free spectral range would have allowed us to be more conclusive about the origin of the wings in both gl490 and m8e as well .",
    "one important consequence of the presence of strong line broadening mechanisms in the high series infrared hydrogen lines is that , on their own , they are poor tracers of a wind or a disc .",
    "a better tracer of a wind are undoubtedly the hei lines from metastable levels , although , unfortunately , not every young stellar object shows this emission . the hydrogen lines do however provide a means to test for the presence of very dense circumstellar material ( through broadening ) .",
    "we also attempted to utilise the model of castor et al .",
    "( 1970 ) to estimate physical scattering parameters , assuming that was the dominant mechanism .",
    "the fits were either highly degenerate in the parameters where the core line width is close to matching that required for the wings ( eg bd+40@xmath154124 , m17sw irs and vv ser ) , or else returned values that indicate that although the profile can be a good match , the estimated parameters are not physically sensible ( eg mwc  297 )",
    ". it may be that the success of this model in the case of lk h@xmath13 101 by hamman and persson ( 1989 ) was fortuitous , since it is a very similar type of object .",
    "they fitted to h@xmath13 which will have more easily detectable wings for electron scattering , and hence they can be seen to higher velocities which is what drives the fit to the electron temperature .",
    "it is worth considering briefly why the model fits at all if the parameter estimation is so poor .",
    "the reason is simply that outlined by laor ( 2006 ) ",
    "multiple scattering gives rise to a close to exponential profile , and the high velocity component of the castor et al model is essentially very close to an exponential .",
    "it seems clear that a full monte - carlo approach to modelling these systems , such as that outlined in kurosawa et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , is required to proceed much further with any analysis .",
    "we have also shown that the 1.688@xmath2 m z@xmath11f@xmath12c@xmath11f@xmath12 feii line is seen in massive and intermediate mass young stellar objects .",
    "we have successfully modelled this line with a simple keplerian disc in all sources bar s106 irs .",
    "the model results are largely in agreement with those found from interferometric near and mid infrared measurements of the continuum where such data exist .",
    "we therefore ascribe a disc origin to the feii line in most sources , since we know from the interferometry and other data that these sources do have discs , and our simple model fits are largely successful .",
    "this is in agreement with previous findings from optical data that fluorescent feii emission is a good disc tracer in classical be stars .",
    "the counter - example of s106  irs cautions against too simple an over - interpretation of this result however .",
    "overall therefore , these data are strongly suggestive that all of the sources observed have evidence that a disc is present , as expected for such young sources , and the line broadening indicates a very dense circumstellar environment .",
    "the likeliest origin for the bulk of the emission lines is a combination of a disc and a wide opening angle wind or disc - wind .",
    "the relative contributions of the latter varies widely between different species and even different lines of the same species .",
    "the similarity of features between these sources and lower mass t tauri stars is notable .",
