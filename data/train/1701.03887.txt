    "recently , a new type of material consisting of a black phosphorus monolayer ( phosphorene ) has emerged as a viable candidate in the field of two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials  @xcite . unlike graphene which does have a plannar structure , phosphorene forms a puckered honeycomb structure , owing to a @xmath0 hybridization with a high in - plane structure anisotropy which has been affected in the optical and transport properties of phosphorene  @xcite .",
    "charge - carrier mobilities are very high at room temperature @xmath1 @xmath2 v@xmath3 s@xmath3  @xcite and they exhibit a strongly anisotropic behavior in phosphorene - based field effect transistor with a high on / off ratio of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the band structure of few - layer black phosphoreus has a direct gap , spanning a wide range in the visible spectrum from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ev  @xcite .",
    "the edge magnetism has been explored in different edge cutting directions  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of @xmath7 transition - metal atoms induces magnetism , where the magnitude of the magnetic moment depends on the metal species and the result can be tuned by the applied strain  @xcite .",
    "also , it is found that a spin - polarized state appears in monolayer black phosphorus by non - magnetic impurity doping  @xcite .",
    "these properties make phosphorene a quite interesting 2d material for next generation electronic and spintronic devices based on the spin degree of freedom , which are almost dissipationless unlike those based on the charge degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the conservation of angular momenta between itinerant electrons and localized magnetizations in magnetic materials leads to the fascinating concept of spin - transfer torque ; the spin angular momentum of the electrons can be transferred to the magnetization via their mutual exchange coupling which enables to derive the dynamics of magnetization by charge current .",
    "sloncwezski and berger were the first to theorize about the existence of this phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "it is found to be important in all known magnetic materials and present in a variety of material structures and device geometries composed of magnetic - nonmagnetic multilayers such as magnetic tunnel junctions , spin valves , point contacts , nanopillars , and nanowires  @xcite .",
    "the spin current flowing into the magnetic region exerts a torque on the magnetization , if the current polarization direction is non - collinear to the local magnetization in the magnetic material .",
    "this spin - transfer torque effect can cause magnetization switching for sufficiently large currents without the need for an external field .",
    "the switching aspect provides a unique opportunity to create fast - switching spin - transfer torque magnetic random access memories ( stt - mram )  @xcite , with the advantage of low - power consumption and better scalability over conventional mrams which use magnetic fields to flip the magnetizations .",
    "spin - torque oscillator is another prominent example that serves as a field generator for microwave assisted recording of hard - disk drives  @xcite .",
    "also , the spin - transfer torque leads to the spin - torque diode effect in magnetic tunnel junctions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this new discovery in condensed matter and material physics has expanded a mean available to manipulate the magnetization of magnetic materials and as a result have accelerated technological development of high - performance and high density magnetic storage devices  @xcite .",
    "another important quantity in this field is the tunneling magnetoresistance which occurs at ferromagnetic / normal / ferromagnetic ( f / n / f ) hybrid structures .",
    "the resistance of the junction is different for parallel ( p ) and anti - parallel ( ap ) magnetiozation configurations and it can be experimentally measured  @xcite .",
    "spin - polarized resonant tunneling has been intensely studied  @xcite because of its potential for applications in spin - transfer torque switching enhancement  @xcite , cavity polaritons using the resonant tunneling diode  @xcite , and in the spin - dependent resonant tunneling devices for tuning the tunneling magnetoresistance  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the charge and spin transport characteristics of the monolayer phosphorene f / n / f hybrid structure in which the two f regions with non - collinear magnetizations are connected through the normal segment of length @xmath8 .",
    "we model our system within the scattering matrix formalism  @xcite .",
    "a similar study has been utilized in graphene  @xcite and silicene  @xcite . within the scattering formalism , we find that the transmission probability of an incoming electron from the spin @xmath9-band of the left f region of the f / n / f structure with p configuration of magnetizations has a decreasing behavior with respect to an increase of the incidence angle , while a peak structure appears for an incoming @xmath10-band electron in the proposed structure with small length @xmath8 .",
    "we demonstrate the appearance of a peak structure with perfect transmission for the @xmath9-band electron together with additional peaks in the transmission probability of the @xmath10-band electron , by increasing the contact length @xmath8 .",
    "however , both the incoming electrons from the @xmath11- and @xmath10-bands to the f / n / f structure with ap alignment of magnetization vectors have decreased transmission probabilities with the increase of the angle of incidence for small contact lengths and peak structures for large contact lengths .",
    "the application of a local gate voltage to the large - length n region of the f / n / f structure leads to the amplification of transmission probability at defined angles of incidence and the attenuation of the transmission at other travelling modes in the proposed structure with @xmath12-doped n region .",
    "then , we evaluate how it is possible to control the magnitude of the charge conductance by means of a local gate voltage in the n region , and manipulating the magnetization directions of two f regions .",
    "depending on the chemical potential of the f region @xmath13 , the charge conductance can be suppressed away from the ap alignment of magnetizations and finite at ap alignment in the n - type doped f / n / f structure . in particular , it displays a maximum near ap configuration and a minimum at p configuration in the corresponding structure with",
    "p - doped n region .",
    "we further demonstrate that the proposed spin valve structure exhibits a remarkably large magnetoresistance in analogy to the giant magnetoresistance in magnetic materials  @xcite , which can be tuned to unity for determined ranges of @xmath13 .",
    "more importantly , we find that the perfect spin valve effect is preserved for large lengths of the n region and shows strong robustness with respect to increasing the chemical potential @xmath14 with the local gate voltage . in addition , we compute the equilibrium magnetic torque exerted on the magnetic order parameter of the right f region along @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions and demonstrate the penetration of the torque into the f region . we show that the sign change of the torque can be realized by means of the gate voltage in the n region and tuning the exchange field of the f region , in addition to its magnitude changes .",

    ", changing the exchange field @xmath158 value , leads to the sign change of the torque @xmath157 in addition to its magnitude changes [ see fig . [ fig:7](c ) ] .",
    "however , the magnitude of the torque component @xmath151 increases with increasing the @xmath158 value , and can be two order of magnitudes larger than that of the @xmath157 .",
    "a large discrepancy between @xmath151 and @xmath157 originates from the anisotropic band structure of phosphorene .",
    "note that in graphene f / n / f structure , @xmath151 is qualitatively similar to @xmath157  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the magnetotransport characteristics of a monolayer phosphorene ferromagnetic / normal / ferromagnetic ( f / n / f ) junction with non - collinear magnetizations .",
    "we have found that the transmission probabilities of the incoming electrons from the spin @xmath11- and @xmath10-bands of the f region have different behavior by increasing the angle of incidence to the f / n / f structure with parallel ( p ) alignment of magnetization vectors , when the length of the n region @xmath8 is small .",
    "the transmission probability has a monotonically decreasing behavior with the incidence angle for an incoming @xmath9-band electron , while a peak structure appears for an incident @xmath10-band electron .",
    "increasing the contact length @xmath8 leads to the appearance of a peak structure with unit transmission for the incoming @xmath9-band electron and the enhancement of the peaks number in the transmission probability of the incoming @xmath10-band electron . while the transmission probabilities , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , of the both incoming @xmath11- and @xmath10-bands electrons to the proposed structure with anti - parallel ( ap ) alignment of magnetizations have decreasing behavior with respect to the angle of incidence for small contact lengths and peak structures with the amplitudes @xmath119 for larger lengths @xmath8 .",
    "also , applying a local gate voltage to the n region with large length @xmath8 amplifies the transmission probability at defined angles of incidence and attenuates it at other traveling modes in the corresponding f / n / f structure with @xmath12-doped n region .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the charge conductance of the proposed structure can be changed significantly by tuning the chemical potential of the n region @xmath104 , and the relative orientation of the magnetization directions in the two f regions .",
    "interestingly , the charge conductance of the n - type doped f /",
    "n / f structure can be almost zero away from the ap configuration of magnetizations , for determining ranges of the chemical potential of the f region @xmath43 .",
    "more importantly , it attains a minimum at p configuration and a maximum near ap configuration in the corresponding structure with p - type doped n region .",
    "we have further demonstrated that the proposed structure exhibits a relative difference of the electrical resistance in the p and ap alignments of magnetizations , which can be tuned to unity for defined values of @xmath43 .",
    "this perfect spin valve effect is more robust with respect to an increase of @xmath104 and is preserved even for large lengths of the n region .",
    "furthermore , we have evaluated the equilibrium spin - transfer torque , which can be used to derive domain - wall motion in ferromagnetic materials , acting on the magnetization of the right f region .",
    "we have found that the total torque is not absorbed in the interface region , and both the magnitude and sign of the torque components can be controlled by tuning @xmath104 , and the exchange field of the f region .",
    "this work is partially supported by iran science elites federation .",
    "having said before , we calculate the transmission amplitudes @xmath65 and @xmath64 by matching the wave functions of the three regions of the left f , n region , and the right f region at the two interfaces , namely @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "those amplitudes read as @xmath171 with            finally , the spin - dependent transmission probabilities obtains from the above relations as follow @xmath176 we mention that the transmission probabilities of the incoming spin @xmath10-band electron , @xmath177 , can be obtained from the above formulas by replacing @xmath11 with @xmath10 , and vice versa .",
