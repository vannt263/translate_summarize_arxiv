    "the search for observational evidence of variations in the ` fundamental ' constants that can be measured in our four - dimensional world is an extremely exciting area of current research , with several independent claims of detections in different contexts emerging in the past year or so , together with other improved constraints .",
    "see @xcite for a non - technical introduction , and @xcite for an extensive compilation of existing constraints",
    ".    the importance of this search can not be over - emphasized . varying non - gravitational constants are forbidden by general relativity and all metric theories of gravity .",
    "a varying @xmath0 violates the equivalence principle , signaling the breakdown of gravity as a purely geometric phenomenon and proving the existence of additional gravitational fields ( apart from the metric ) in the universe .",
    "indeed , many models proposed as explanations for varying @xmath0 are _ already _ ruled out by the standard gravitational tests alone , regardless of any predictions and experimental results on @xmath0 itself .",
    "the recent explosion of interest in the study of varying constants is mostly due to the results of webb and collaborators @xcite of a @xmath2 detection of a fine - structure constant that was _ smaller _ in the past , @xmath3 for @xmath4 ; indeed , more recent work @xcite provides an even stronger detection .",
    "an independent technique was used to measure the ratio of the proton and electron masses , @xmath5 @xcite . using two systems at redshifts @xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xmath8 or @xmath9 depending on which of the ( two ) available tables of ` standard ' laboratory wavelengths is used .",
    "this is an obvious clue that systematic effects , possibly as large as @xmath10 , may still be unaccounted for .",
    "a recent re - analysis @xcite of the oklo bound using new samarium samples collected deeper underground ( aiming to minimize contamination ) also finds two possible results , @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "note that these are given as rates of variation , and effectively probe time scales corresponding to a cosmological redshift of about @xmath13 .",
    "unlike the case above , these two values correspond to two possible physical branches of the solution .",
    "the first of branch provides a null result , while the second is a strong detection of an @xmath0 that was _ larger _ at @xmath14 , that is a relative variation that is opposite to the webb _",
    "result . even though there are some hints ( coming from the analysis of gadolinium samples ) that the first branch is preferred , this is by no means settled and further analysis is required to verify it . while in itself this second branch would nt contradict webb _",
    "( since oklo probes much smaller redshift and the suggested magnitude of the variation is smaller than that suggested by the quasar data ) , it would have striking effects on the theoretical modeling of such variations .",
    "proof that @xmath0 was once larger would sound the death knell for any theory which models the varying @xmath0 through a scalar field whose behavior is akin to that of a dilaton .",
    "examples include bekenstein s theory @xcite or simple variations thereof @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can quite easily see @xcite that in any such model having sensible cosmological parameters and obeying other standard constraints @xmath0 must be a monotonically increasing function of time .",
    "since these dilatonic - type models are arguably the simplest and best - motivated models for varying alpha from a particle physics point of view , any evidence against them would be extremely exciting , since it would point towards the presence of significantly different , yet undiscovered physical mechanisms .",
    "however , given that there are both theoretical and experimental reasons to expect that any recent variations will be small , it is crucial to develop tools allowing us to measure @xmath0 in the early universe , as variations with respect to the present value could be much larger then . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have carried out a joint analysis using cmb and big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) data , finding evidence at the one sigma level for a smaller alpha in the past ( at the level of @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) , though at the two sigma level the results were consistent with no variation .",
    "this also established the existence of various important degeneracies in the problem .",
    "we have recently performed @xcite an up - to - date analysis of the cosmic microwave background constraints on varying @xmath0 as well as , for the first time , an analysis of its effects on the large - scale structure ( lss ) power spectrum .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of why both of these are affected by variations in @xmath0 .",
    "although these cmb and lss constraints are complementary , and can help break degeneracies by determining other cosmological parameters , they certainly can not be blindly combined together .",
    "we are not combining direct constraints on the parameter @xmath0 itself , obtained through both methods , to obtain a tighter constraint .",
    "this can not be done , since the cmb and lss analyses are sensitive to the values of @xmath0 at different redshift ranges , so there is no reason why these values should be the same .",
    "additionally , there is no well - motivated theory that could relate such variations at different cosmological epochs .",
    "all that one could do at this stage would be to assume some toy model where a certain behavior would occur , but this would mean introducing various additional parameters , thus weakening the analysis .",
    "we chose not to pursue this path and leave the analysis as model - independent as possible .",
    "what we are doing is using additional information ( which is also sensitive to @xmath0 ) to better constrain other parameters in the underlying cosmological model , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the densities of various matter components , which we can reliably assume are unchanged throughout the cosmological epochs in question .",
    "in other words , we are simply _ self - consistently _ selecting more stringent priors for our analysis .",
    "the constraints obtained by combined analysis are reported in @xcite .",
    "as one would expect , when constraints from other and independent cosmological datasets are included in the cmb analysis , the constraints on variations on @xmath0 become significantly stronger .    the precision with which the forthcoming satellite experiments map and planck will be able to determine variations in @xmath0",
    "can be readily estimated with a fisher matrix analysis ( fma ) .",
    "some authors have already performed such an analysis in the past , but their analysis was based on a different set of cosmological parameters and assumed cosmic variance limited measurements . in our fma",
    "@xcite we also take into account the expected performance of the map and planck satellites and we make use of a cosmological parameters set which is well adapted for limiting numerical inaccuracies . furthermore , the fma can provide useful insight into the degeneracies among different parameters , with minimal computational effort .",
    "map will be able to constrain variations in @xmath0 at the time of last scattering to within @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , all others marginalised ) .",
    "this corresponds to an improvement of a factor of 3 relative to current limits , planck will narrow it down to about half a percent .",
    "if all other parameters are supposed to be known and fixed to their ml value , then a factor of 10 is to be gained in the accuracy of @xmath0 .",
    "however , if all parameters are being estimated jointly , the accuracy on variations in @xmath0 will not go beyond @xmath21 , even for planck .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath17 suffer from partial degeneracies with @xmath0 , which are discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "planck s errors , as measured by the inverse square root of the eigenvalues , are smaller by a factor of about 4 on average . for all but",
    "one eigenvector planck also obtains a better alignment of the principal directions with the axis of the physical parameters .",
    "this is of course in a slightly different form the statement that planck will measure the cosmological parameters with less correlations among them .",
    "we have shown that the currently available data is consistent with no variation of @xmath0 from the epoch of recombination to the present day , though interestingly enough the cmb and lss datasets seem to prefer , on their own , variations of @xmath0 with opposite signs . whether or not this statement has any physical relevance ( beyond the results of the statistical analysis ) is something that remains to be investigated in more detail . in any case , any such ( relative ) variation is constrained to be less than about @xmath1 .",
    "the prospects for the future are definitely bright .",
    "the forthcoming satellite experiments ( including data on polarization and temperature - polarization cross - correlation ) will provide a dramatic improvement on these results .",
    "these tools , together with other measurements coming from bbn @xcite and quasar and related data @xcite offer the exciting prospect of being able to map the value of @xmath0 at very many different cosmological epochs , including early - universe constraints with an accuracy comparable to the currently existing recent - universe ones @xcite .",
    "this should allow us to impose very tight constraints on higher - dimensional models where these variations are ubiquitous .",
