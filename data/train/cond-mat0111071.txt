    "edge electron states in various materials attracted a great deal of attention recently . in this paper , we discuss some experiments proposed to observe the effects of such states in the organic quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) conductors @xmath0 and the inorganic quasi - two - dimensional perovskites @xmath1 . for general overviews of these materials ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to encourage practical realization of these experiments by summarizing basic ideas and giving quantitative order - of - magnitude estimates without going into deep theoretical physics and mathematical formalism .",
    "the latter can be found in the cited references .",
    "in general , a system with an energy gap has delocalized electron states in the bulk with energies above and below the energy gap",
    ". however , it may also have bound states with energies inside the gap , which are localized near the sample edges or other inhomogeneities .",
    "the energy gap may be of different origin , e.g.  insulating or superconducting . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fisdw ] , we study the case where the gap is produced by the magnetic - field - induced spin - density wave ( fisdw ) in @xmath0 . in secs .",
    "[ sec : midgap ] and [ sec : srru ] , we consider triplet superconducting states in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 are q1d crystals consisting of conducting chains parallel to the * a * axis , with substantial interchain coupling in the * b * direction and much weaker coupling in the * c * direction @xcite , along which we select the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 axes .",
    "the lattice spacings are @xmath6 nm , @xmath7 nm , and @xmath8 nm , whereas the typical sample dimensions are @xmath9 mm and @xmath10 mm .",
    "thus , a typical sample contains @xmath11 chains and @xmath12 layers .",
    "when a magnetic field @xmath13 is applied along the * c * axis , it causes a phase transition into the fisdw state , which exhibits the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) .",
    "the hall conductivity per one ( * a*,*b * ) layer is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a small , @xmath13-dependent integer number , @xmath16 is the electron charge , and @xmath17 is the planck constant . in general , it is expected that @xmath15 chiral gapless edge states should exist in an iqhe system along the perimeter of the sample , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fisdw ] .",
    "such edge states were indeed constructed theoretically for fisdw in refs .",
    "@xcite .      as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the edge states travel with the group velocities @xmath18 m / s perpendicular to the chains and the fermi velocity @xmath19 km / s parallel to the chains , where @xmath20 k is the fisdw gap . in the time - of - flight experiment described in ref .",
    "@xcite , a pulse , sent by the pulser , perturbs the edge states ( see fig.[fig : fisdw ] ) .",
    "this perturbation is carried downstream and reaches the detector d1 with the delay time @xmath21 @xmath22s and the detector d2 with the greater delay @xmath23 .",
    "the pulse can be electric ( perturbing the occupation number of the edge states ) , or magnetic ( creating spin polarization of the edge states ) , or thermal ( perturbing the electron temperature of the edge states ) .",
    "the time - of - flight experiments with electric perturbations have been successfully performed in semiconducting qhe systems @xcite .",
    "since the chiral edge states are gapless , their the specific heat @xmath24 is linear in temperature @xmath25 and should dominate at low temperatures , where the bulk contribution is frozen out because of the fisdw gap @xmath26 .",
    "the edge specific heat per one chain is @xmath27 @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant @xcite . multiplying this number by the total number of chains @xmath30",
    ", we obtain the total edge specific heat @xmath31 @xmath28 .",
    "this value is smaller than the bulk specific heat in the normal state by the factor @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 @xmath22 m is the coherence length ) , but it may be still measurable with a sensitive technique @xcite .",
    "1d chiral electron gas of temperature @xmath25 carries thermal current @xmath34 .",
    "let us consider a fisdw sample with a heat source on the left , a heat drain on the right , and two thermometers @xmath35 and @xmath36 on the sides , as show in fig.[fig : tqhe ] .",
    "the circulating edge current raises its temperature to @xmath35 by gaining thermal energy from the heat source and flows along the top edge of the bar maintaining that temperature ( assuming no heat loss ) until it reaches the heat drain .",
    "there the edge current loses its thermal energy , drops its temperature to @xmath36 , and returns along the bottom edge maintaining that temperature .",
    "the net heat current from the source to the drain is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the thermal hall conductance , @xmath39 is the temperature difference in the @xmath4 direction , and @xmath40 is the average temperature of the edges .",
    "eq.([hall ] ) demonstrates the thermal qhe proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "both the thermal and electrical hall conductances are quantized with the same integer @xmath15 and are related to each other by the wiedemann - franz law for free electrons @xcite .",
    "detection of the thermal qhe will therefore confirm the existence of the chiral edge states in the fisdw phase .",
    "the quantum of thermal hall conductance per one layer is @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "the total thermal hall conductance is obtained by multiplying this number by the number of layers @xmath43 .",
    "the quantum of thermal conductance has been measured in the state - of - the - art experiments @xcite .    the above consideration assumed an idealized case where the longitudinal thermal conductances @xmath44 and @xmath45 are zero .",
    "in general , there will be nonzero temperature gradients in both @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions : @xmath46 because of the wiedemann - franz law , we expect that @xmath47 in the qhe regime , where @xmath48 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ hall ] ) approximately holds .",
    "however , there also exist phonon contributions to @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in ( tmtsf)@xmath49clo@xmath50 ,",
    "the longitudinal thermal conductance per layer due to phonons is @xmath51 at @xmath52 and shows a power - law temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "the phonon contribution is comparable to the quantum of @xmath38 and can be made even smaller at lower temperatures , so an observation of the thermal qhe in the fisdw state of @xmath0 is feasible . in general ,",
    "the thermal hall conductance can be determined from the relation @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "in @xmath0 , the upper critical magnetic field @xmath54 exceeds the pauli paramagnetic limit by a factor greater than 4 @xcite , and the knight shift does not change between the normal and superconducting states @xcite .",
    "this indicates the triplet character of superconductivity in these materials @xcite .",
    "the triplet order parameter can be written as @xmath55 $ ] , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the spin indices , @xmath58 are the spin pauli matrices , and @xmath59 is the antisymmetric spin metric tensor .",
    "we only consider the case of a uniform spin orientation : @xmath60 , where * d * is a unit vector .",
    "the simplest triplet pairing potential @xmath61 is an odd function of @xmath62 , i.e.  it has opposite signs on the two sheets of the fermi surface located near @xmath63 .",
    "this sign change results in formation of andreev bound states with energies exactly in the middle of the energy gap ( midgap states ) at the edges perpendicular to the chains , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "unlike in the fisdw case discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fisdw ] , these midgap edge states are not chiral .      conceptually , the most straightforward way to detect the midgap edge states is by electron tunneling between a normal metal and the superconducting @xmath0 .",
    "tunneling into the edges perpendicular and parallel to the chains should exhibit a zero - bias peak and a gap , as shown in the left and right panels of fig.[fig : tunnel ] , correspondingly .",
    "unfortunately , it turned out difficult to achieve good tunneling junctions with the organic @xmath0 .",
    "below we discuss alternative experiments .",
    "when a magnetic field @xmath13 is applied parallel to the vector * d * , the energies on the spin - up and spin - down midgap states split because of the zeeman effect . at zero temperature",
    ", only the lower - energy states would be occupied , thus the edge states should be spin - polarized , yielding the magnetic moment @xmath64 a  m@xmath65 per chain ( @xmath66 is the bohr magneton ) , or @xmath67 a  m@xmath65 for the whole edge @xcite . at a finite temperature ,",
    "the edges would exhibit a curie - like paramagnetic spin response to the magnetic field , opposite to the diamagnetic meissner response of the bulk .    in order to perform the experiment proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is necessary to know the orientation of vector * d*. the theoretical analysis @xcite of the @xmath54 anisotropy @xcite indicates that @xmath68 .",
    "however , recent knight shift measurements @xcite indicate that @xmath69 .",
    "we will consider the former case below . in the latter case ,",
    "magnetic field @xmath70 would quickly suppress superconductivity by the orbital effect . in the case",
    "@xmath71 , local magnetic susceptibility could be measures using a coil , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coil ] , or by another method .",
    "as the coil approaches to the sample end , magnetic susceptibility should change sign from diamagnetic to paramagnetic because of the edge states contribution .",
    "they are localized within the coherence length @xmath72 @xmath22 m , where @xmath73 mev is the superconducting gap @xcite .      for @xmath74",
    ", the zeeman - split edge states effectively form a two - level system .",
    "it should exhibit the schottky anomaly in specific heat : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total number of chains .",
    "( [ schottky ] ) reaches the maximum @xmath77 at the temperature @xmath78 proportional to the magnetic field . in order to avoid the contribution from the extended bulk states above the gap",
    ", the temperature should be lower than the energy gap : @xmath79 , thus the magnetic field should be well below the pauli limiting field : @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath1 is a quasi - two - dimensional perovskite with the superconducting transition temperature @xmath81 k. the main fermi surface is a cylinder of radius @xmath82 , and the interlayer spacing is @xmath83 nm @xcite .",
    "we assume the typical sample dimensions to be @xmath84 mm and @xmath85 mm , which makes @xmath86 layers .",
    "the superconducting pairing in @xmath1 is believed to be triplet and chiral .",
    "the simplest proposed pairing potential has the form @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was suggested that the gap @xmath88 is a real function of * k * with the nodes .",
    "the theoretical fit @xcite of the tunneling data supports the horizontal lines of nodes , with @xmath88 being a periodic function of @xmath89 .",
    "however , in the present paper , we only consider the simplest case @xmath90 without nodes , because we focus on the question whether the superconductivity in @xmath2 is chiral .",
    "the main experimental evidence for that is the change of muon spin relaxation time at @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "however , this is rather indirect indication of the time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "below we discuss experiments with the chiral edge states , which could give direct proofs of the time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "these experiments do not depend qualitatively on whether @xmath88 is constant or modulated .",
    "a @xmath92-wave superconductor has chiral andreev edge states , which circulate around the perimeter of the sample with the group velocity @xmath93 m / s @xcite , where we used the value @xmath94 k. these states are analogous to those in qhe systems , e.g.  the fisdw system discussed in sec.[sec : fisdw ] .",
    "the conventional qhe with electric voltage is not possible in superconductors @xcite , but the spin qhe is possible @xcite . the chiral character of the edge states in @xmath1 could be detected in the time - of - flight experiments described in sec .",
    "[ pulse1 ] , performed with magnetic or thermal , but not electric pulses .",
    "suppose a short pulse of a magnetic field parallel to @xmath95 is applied at a certain point on the edge of the sample .",
    "the pulse would create a local population imbalance between the up and down spin states and , thus , a local magnetization .",
    "this spin imbalance will then travel along the edge with the group velocity @xmath96 , and the corresponding magnetization can be detected at a distance @xmath97 at the time @xmath98 with a high - sensitivity squid magnetometer @xcite .",
    "given the typical sample size , the time delay could be about @xmath99 @xmath22s .",
    "the duration of the pulse should be shorter than @xmath100 , but longer than @xmath101 ps .",
    "the maximum possible spin imbalance is achieved when @xmath102 at @xmath103 t , which generates magnetic moment @xmath104 a  m per unit length of the edge .",
    "note that @xmath105 will not produce the effect .",
    "however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ thermalqh2 ] , the longitudinal thermal conductance in @xmath1 is much greater than the transverse one , so the edge pulse could quickly diffuse into the bulk .",
    "the chiral edge states in a @xmath92-wave superconductor should produce the thermal qhe @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the thermal hall conductance is given by eq .",
    "( [ hall ] ) with @xmath106 , and the factor 2 removed for lack of spin degeneracy .",
    "however , the longitudinal thermal conductivity in @xmath1 at @xmath107 k is @xmath108 w / k@xmath65  m @xcite .",
    "this translates into the thermal conductance @xmath109 per layer , which is three orders of magnitude larger than the quantum of thermal hall conductance .",
    "thus , the thermal transport in @xmath1 should be predominantly longitudinal , and it would be problematic to detect a very small transverse temperature difference @xmath110 in the experimental setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tqhe ] .",
    "the chiral edge states in a @xmath92-wave superconductor also carry the ground - state electric current @xmath111 a per layer @xcite , where @xmath112 kg is the effective electron mass .",
    "multiplied by the number of layers @xmath113 , this translates into the total surface current of 5.6 a , which would generate a huge spontaneous magnetic field in the bulk of the superconductor . however",
    ", this magnetic field is actually screened by the meissner supercurrent of the condensate @xcite .",
    "the distribution of electric current and magnetic field near the surface of @xmath1 was calculated self - consistently in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming an infinitely long sample in the * c * direction .",
    "they found that the edge states current is localized within the coherence length @xmath114 nm , whereas the condensate counter - current flows within the larger penetration depth @xmath115 nm , as sketched in fig.[fig : squid ] . because of the difference between @xmath116 and @xmath117 , there is a non - zero magnetic field near the surface , with the maximal value @xmath118 g reached at the distance @xmath117 and exponentially decreasing inside the bulk .",
    "( here @xmath119 t  m@xmath65 is the magnetic flux quantum . )",
    "this magnetic field produces the magnetic flux @xmath120 t  m per unit length of the edge , which could be detected by a scanning squid microscope @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : squid ] . the total magnetic flux through the squid pickup loop of the size @xmath121 @xmath22 m is @xmath122 , big enough for squid detection .",
    "on the other hand , squid microscope would not resolve the boundaries between domains with opposite chiralities , where the average magnetic flux is zero @xcite .",
    "many of the experiments discussed above are technically very challenging .",
    "the most realistic experiment appears to be the observation of spontaneous magnetic flux at the edges of @xmath2 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : squid ] .",
    "it only requires cooling the sample below 1 k and scanning the edges with a squid microscope having the typical magnetic flux sensitivity and pickup loop size @xcite .",
    "positive or negative result of such an experiment would permit to make a definite conclusion whether superconductivity in @xmath1 is chiral or not , i.e.  whether it breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
