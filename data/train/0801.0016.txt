    "an explicit calculation shows that    @xmath74    this is diagonal if @xmath75 . if we introduce the new coordinate @xmath76 it is also manifestly a flat metric , and it covers a wedge shaped region .",
    "given the function @xmath77 we can reparametrize @xmath78 so that we end up with polar coordinates , or rindler coordinates if the metric is lorentzian , and read off the opening angle of the wedge .",
    "anyway the small theorem is proved .",
    "there is an exception if @xmath79 and @xmath80 , since then the metric is degenerate .",
