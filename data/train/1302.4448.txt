    "the spin evolution of pulsars and magnetars is studied by long term monitoring of pulse arrival times , allowing the spin period , spin - down rate , orbital motion and astrometric variations of the neutron star ( ns ) to be inferred .",
    "the variation of these pulse arrival times from the best fit models of the timing evolution is referred to as timing noise .",
    "timing noise was first observed in the crab pulsar @xcite and has been identified as a ubiquitous property of pulsars @xcite .",
    "recently much effort has been made to understand the stochastic timing noise in millisecond pulsars , as timing arrays of low - noise recycled pulsars will allow the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "millisecond pulsars typically have relatively low inferred surface magnetic field ( @xmath3 g ) , due to age and accretion history .",
    "most isolated pulsars have spin - down inferred surface magnetic fields ( @xmath4 ) in the range @xmath5 g , while the highest known magnetic fields are possessed by magnetars ( @xmath6 g ) .",
    "magnetars include anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) whose x - ray luminosities dwarf their spin down luminosities and most likely originate from internal magnetic field decay @xcite ; and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , hard x - ray transient sources that can undergo extreme outbursts .",
    "mode - changing and nulling behaviors in pulsars have been linked to spin - down torque variations @xcite , implying that such behavior is indicative of variations of the open field line regions of the magnetosphere .",
    "recent simultaneous x - ray and radio observations of psr b0943@xmath710 @xcite have provided evidence that such variability is indicative of rapid _ global _ variations of the magnetosphere .    in this letter",
    "we study the timing noise for radio pulsars and magnetars , inferring a source of timing noise in high b - field pulsars and axps which correlates strongly with magnetic field .",
    "we examine physical models to explain the dependence of this timing noise on @xmath4 , and identify this timing noise as evidence for global magnetospheric variability .",

    "here we adopt the approach of modelling timing noise as a random walk process @xcite .",
    "we utilize the formalism of @xcite in order to define the random walk strengths of various processes : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , for random walks in phase , frequency , and spin - down respectively , where @xmath11 is the occurrence rate of the random walk steps , and @xmath12 indicates an ensemble average .",
    "the quantities @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denote stochastic variations in phase , frequency , and spin - down rate , respectively .",

    "tn^2 t^-5 , where , @xmath16 is the time span over which the observations were taken , @xmath0 is the rms phase residual of the data for a given timing solution , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are correction factors @xcite to compensate for random walk power removed by the @xmath20th - order polynomial fit when the residuals are determined .",
    "previous analyses @xcite have shown that simple random walk processes can not explain the totality of timing noise .",
    "we argue that if some random walk timing noise component becomes dominant as magnetic field increases from @xmath21 g to @xmath22 g this should result in a lower bound in the distribution of the random walk strength that increases with @xmath4 .    in figure [ strengthplot ]",
    "we show the random walk strengths for various pulsars versus @xmath4 the surface dipole magnetic field strength . the strengths @xmath23 and",

    "[ strengthplot ] ]    while there is no obvious correlation between @xmath4 and the random walk strengths for phase noise ( @xmath30 ) or spin - down noise ( @xmath31 ) in figure [ strengthplot ] , there appears to be a weak correlation of the fn strength ( @xmath32 ) with @xmath4 across the range of magnetic field .",

    "we note , however , that above a field strength of @xmath28 g , the lower bound of the fn strength distribution rises sharply with @xmath35 .",
    "we focus on fn as the change in @xmath23 along this lower envelope is larger than the intrinsic scatter of the distribution for fn ( particularly due to the inclusion of axp timing data ) .",

    "these scalings are within the @xmath37 confidence intervals for the timing noise scalings inferred by @xcite for magnetars , except for the dependence on @xmath16 , which may be different due to their inclusion of sgrs after outburst to evaluate the mean timing properties of the population .",
    "caution must be used in interpreting scaling laws with inferred @xmath38 because any correlation is based on the same dynamical quantities . with this in mind , we consider two different physical models of timing noise due to magnetospheric variability , torque variation , and moment of inertia variation .",
    "spin - down torque variation and mode - changing are associated with perturbations of the open field lines @xcite . the frequency noise strength for torque variability should scale as @xmath39 @xcite , which is inconsistent with",

    "relativistic force - free solutions of the magnetosphere that take into account the poloidal currents @xcite lead to similar results as their differences are concentrated near the light cylinder , while most of the mass and energy density is near the ns surface . even for plasma density several orders of magnitude larger than for gj @xcite the contribution of the plasma to the moment of inertia of the magnetosphere can be safely ignored .     versus @xmath4 for the same pulsars and magnetars shown in figure [ strengthplot ] .",
    "@xmath67 is the number of moment of inertia random walk steps that occur per year .",
    "we compare this to the fractional moment of inertia contained in the magnetosphere , @xmath68 ( assuming an aligned dipole for a @xmath69 mass ns with radius 12 km).[noiseplot ] ]",
    "mode - changing and nulling events are related to rapid variability of the open field line region of the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "recent observations have shown that such rapid variability may be a global magnetospheric phenomenon @xcite , and not simply confined to the open field lines .",
    "thus , the magnetospheric moment of inertia could also vary on a short timescale .",

    "we define @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a stochastic component to the moment of inertia associated with magnetospheric variations , and @xmath74 is the moment of inertia of the ns that is strongly coupled to the crust such that the coupling timescale is much shorter than the timescale of the variability .",
    "this component is the part of the star that can then respond effectively to the moment of inertia variation .",

    "modeling the stochastic variation of the moment of inertia as a random walk we have @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are random amplitudes and times , while @xmath86 is the unit step function .",
    "the first term of equation then corresponds to fn , while the second term is sn .",
    "considering realistic observing spans the first term must dominate . using the definition of @xmath23 , the variability of the moment of inertia",
    "can then be expressed as _ 1 yr^1/2 i_rms / i_c = , where @xmath87 is the number of random walk steps per year .",
    "this value is plotted against @xmath4 in figure [ noiseplot ] , as well as various fractions of the magnetospheric moment of inertia @xmath88 , assuming an aligned magnetic dipole and a ns mass @xmath69 and radius @xmath89 km .",
    "we note here that above @xmath90 the moment of inertia variability is bounded by @xmath91 .",
    "if the timing noise observed at this lower bound is due to variability of the moment of inertia it follows then that @xmath92 .",
    "assuming @xmath93 to reflect the variability timescales observed in pulsar nulling or mode - changing @xcite , and the strongly coupled fraction of the ns moment of inertia to be @xmath94@xcite over the variability timescale , we can estimate the rms amplitude of the magnetospheric moment of inertia variability , @xmath95 magnetars that are visible in radio vary in timescales ranging from minutes to days depending on the radio frequency @xcite , hinting at varying @xmath67 with radius , yet still allowing reasonably small fluctuations of the magnetospheric moment of inertia .",
    "the magnetosphere is expected to be dynamic near the light cylinder , due to reconnection and instability @xcite .",
    "however , the amplitude of this contribution to the moment of inertia variation is suppressed by a factor @xmath96 as the magnetic field is much weaker there .",
    "this implies that the variability of the moment of inertia must instead occur near the ns surface , where the magnetospheric moment of inertia is largest .",
    "glitches in pulsars and magnetars are impulsive increases in the rotation frequency . the smallest detectable glitch size can be estimated from the timing noise level , by comparing the ( pre - fit ) phase change due to the stochastic noise over the data span required to infer the existence of small glitch , to the phase change due to the glitch itself , @xmath97 for frequency noise .",
    "if the expected phase change due to the noise is larger than the phase change due to the glitch , then a glitch can not be definitively identified . in the continuous limit where",
    "the details of cadence and fitting can be simplified we can then estimate the smallest observable glitch size by assuming that several ( @xmath98 ) time - of - arrival observations , with cadence @xmath99 month , on either side of a small glitch are needed to characterize it .",
    "this gives the estimate @xmath100 .    in figure [ glitch plot ]",
    "we show the relative glitch sizes @xmath101 as a function of magnetic field for the glitching pulsars listed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we also include glitches and glitch candidates from axps 4u 0142@xmath761 @xcite , 1e 2259.1@xmath7586 @xcite , 1e 1841@xmath27045 @xcite , rxs j170849.0@xmath27400910 @xcite and 1e 1048.1@xmath275937 @xcite .",
    "we find that for @xmath102 g , the minimum observed glitch is roughly given by @xmath103 , which is consistent with our estimates above .",
    "thus , we find consistent evidence from glitches for an increase with @xmath4 of the timing noise floor .    while in principle",
    "a glitch due to a change in the magnetospheric moment of inertia could be detected , it would require a large ( @xmath104 ) change in the total magnetospheric moment of inertia to be above the timing noise .",
    "such an event would almost certainly be accompanied by torque variations and particle outflows , as seen during giant flares in sgrs , which would dominate the timing change due to the magnetospheric moment of inertia .    , versus @xmath4 , for radio pulsar glitches @xcite , and for axp glitches @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the magnetospheric moment of inertia to the total moment of inertia ( @xmath68 ) , is also plotted as a function of @xmath4 , along with 10% and 1% of @xmath68 .",
    "the minimum observed glitch size serves as a proxy for the timing noise , scaling with @xmath105 for @xmath106 and is consistent with our estimates of timing noise.[glitch plot ] ]",
    "we have examined pulsar and axp timing noise measurements reported in the literature and shown that a component of timing noise exists which depends on the spin - inferred dipole surface magnetic field strength ( @xmath107 such that @xmath108 ) .",
    "this timing noise component begins to dominate at @xmath2 g , and is responsible for a sharp rise in the floor of the timing noise values across both pulsar and axp populations .",
    "this provides yet another connection between high - b radio pulsars and axps , demonstrating a continuum of behaviors in these nss , as independently suggested by , for example , quiescent x - ray luminosities of these objects @xcite , further ` unifying ' radio pulsars and axps @xcite .",
    "variations near the open field lines can lead to mode changing and torque variability @xcite , however this would result in a frequency noise strength that scales as @xmath109 , and can not explain the observed timing noise dependence .",
    "we have shown that the magnetospheric moment of inertia is @xmath110 , and have proposed a model of magnetospheric moment of inertia variation that is consistent with the observations of both the timing noise strengths and the size of the smallest observable glitches in high-@xmath4 systems . by assuming a rate similar to the known variability in the open field line regions of some pulsars @xcite we can estimate an amplitude for the variability of the magnetospheric moment of inertia @xmath111 .",
    "this variation must occur near the ns surface , where the moment of inertia contribution is largest , as we find that timing noise due to variability confined near the light cylinder is too small to contribute significantly .",
    "recent observations @xcite have also provided evidence that there exists rapid global variability in pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "we suggest that rapid global magnetospheric variability , perhaps due to reconnection or variable currents which have been proposed in pulsar models @xcite , acts as a source of timing noise through moment of inertia variations .",
    "other potential sources of this magnetic field - timing noise dependence that could also be considered are the internal field evolution as a source of moment of inertia variability , or the interaction of the superfluid vortices with the magnetic field affecting glitch dynamics .    _",
