    "recent studies of nets , ranging from social networks to power grids and the internet , revealed that in many cases the degree distribution @xmath6 , i.e. the probability that an arbitrary vertex is connected to exactly @xmath7 other vertices , often exhibits a power law , namely that @xmath8 holds @xcite .",
    "networks for which this relation is fulfilled are called _ scale - free _ ; scale - free networks differ from the classical random graphs @xcite ,",
    "for which the distribution @xmath6 is poissonian , and from small - world - networks @xcite .",
    "recent works have clarified that the properties of scale - free networks , in particular percolation , differ markedly from the classical case @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath6 for @xmath7 large , the so - called tail of @xmath6 , which is quantified by @xmath9 , is fundamental in differentiating between the distinct classes of behavior : thus for @xmath10 the critical exponents change from the usual values found for classical graphs @xcite .",
    "now , the topological properties of a network are reflected in the spectral properties of its connectivity matrix @xmath11 : this matrix is constructed by letting its off - diagonal elements @xmath12 be @xmath13 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are connected or @xmath16 otherwise ; moreover , the diagonal elements @xmath17 of @xmath11 are zero . for scale - free networks",
    "it was found that the density of the eigenvalues of @xmath11 has a triangular form with a power - law tail @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", many problems ranging from the dynamics of randomly branched polymers @xcite and the stress relaxation of near critical gels @xcite , over random resistor - capacitor networks @xcite to glassy relaxation dynamics @xcite , depend on the laplacian @xmath18 ; @xmath18 is connected to @xmath11 via : @xmath19 a whole series of works based on @xmath18 were devoted to classical deterministic and random graphs , such as cayley - trees ( dendrimers ) , hyperbranched macromolecules , the erds - rnyi ( er ) random graph and bond diluted cayley - trees @xcite .",
    "based on the laplacian , many time and frequency - dependent observables can be written as integrals over @xmath0 , the density of eigenvalues of @xmath18 : the structure of these observables is either @xmath20 or some related form , in which @xmath21 is replaced by @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , for random walks , the site averaged return probability @xmath23 of a random walker to the origin is obtained with the choice @xmath24 @xcite .",

    "this integral equation allows us to determine @xmath0 for the classes of scale - free networks discussed in ref",
    "the ensemble of networks under consideration is obtained by starting from @xmath25 vertices .",
    "each vertex @xmath14 has its degree @xmath26 , and the probability distribution of the @xmath26 is @xmath6 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can then connect the vertices pairwise through bonds ( random pairing ) , while fulfilling the condition that the number of bonds emanating from each vertex @xmath14 is given by its degree @xmath26 .",
    "all such possible combinations create the ensemble . in the limit",
    "@xmath27 the probability that a certain vertex is involved in a closed loop of bonds vanishes like @xmath28 @xcite ; thus , in this limit a typical network realization is a set of connected treelike clusters .",
    "such a treelike structure may also be created as follows : we start from a vertex , say @xmath14 , whose random degree @xmath7 is chosen from the given distribution @xmath6 .",
    "then each of the @xmath26 bonds of vertex @xmath14 ends in a new vertex .",
    "one must note now that the probability of reaching via a randomly chosen bond a vertex of degree @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath29 , i.e. it obeys the distribution @xmath30 it follows that we must now distribute the degrees of the newly produced vertices according to @xmath31 , eq . ( [ verbindprob ] ) .",
    "the procedure is then continued step after step and stops only where no new bonds were produced in the previous step .",
    "the method creates all the random trees of the ensemble .",
    "two examples of such ensembles are the bond diluted cayley tree with functionality @xmath32 @xcite , where @xmath33 , and the erds - rnyi random graph , whose degree distribution is @xmath34 @xcite .    depending on the @xmath6-distribution , the ensemble consists either exclusively of finite clusters or it includes an infinite , connected cluster , containing a finite fraction of the vertices of the system @xcite . in refs .",
