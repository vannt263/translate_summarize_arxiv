    "the magnetotransport properties of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in high magnetic fields are successfully described in the edge channel or landauer - bttiker picture @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . according to this model the spatial current distribution in a 2deg in high magnetic fields",
    "is strongly influenced by the filling factor of the 2deg . at the edges of a hall bar the landau levels ( lls ) of the unbounded 2deg",
    "are bent upwards in energy due to the confining potential .",
    "the intersections of these upwards bent landau levels with the fermi energy form the so - called edge states @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "electrons in edge states at opposite edges of the hall bar flow into opposite directions . at integer filling factors the fermi energy lies in the regime of localized states between two landau levels of the 2d - bulk , and a sufficiently small electric current is carried by the edge states only . in thermal equilibrium",
    "all edge states at the same sample edge have the same chemical potential .",
    "scattering between edge states of the same sample edge ( inter - ll scattering ) is likely to occur after a distance which is called the equilibration length @xmath1 .",
    "however , this kind of scattering event does not lead to a nonzero magnetoresistance @xmath2 along the current direction as it can not reverse an electron s direction of motion . over distances up to the equilibration length a nonequilibrium population between edge states ( of the same edge ) can be maintained .",
    "the transport regime in which no equilibration between edge states ( of the same edge ) occurs is called the adiabatic regime . at noninteger filling factors the fermi energy lies within the topmost partially filled landau level .",
    "this topmost ( further also referred to as nth ) landau level can form a bulk conductance channel that allows backscattering of electrons , which leads to a nonzero longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath2",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "the nth channel is almost perfectly decoupled from the lower n@xmath3 edge states @xcite .",
    "this means that the edge states propagate unaffected by the bulk channel just as they would do for integer filling factors .",
    "here we study the photoconductivity of nanostructured 2degs caused by intraband absorption in the quantum hall regime .",
    "intraband photoconductivity of 2degs @xcite has successfully been described by neppl _",
    "_ @xcite using a bolometric model , which was originally employed to explain the mechanism of photoconductivity caused by intersubband resonance in 2degs .",
    "later the same model was also applied to cyclotron - resonance - induced photoconductivity in the quantum hall regime @xcite and to photoconductivity of systems with reduced dimensionality @xcite . in cyclotron resonance ,",
    "the absorption of radiation excites single electrons from the n@xmath3st ( bulk ) ll below the fermi energy to the nth ll above the fermi energy . within a bolometric model the excited electrons thermalize via electron - electron interactions and a new quasi - equilibrium corresponding to a higher electron temperature",
    "is established .",
    "as the longitudinal resistance @xmath2 depends on temperature , the increased electron temperature results in a change of the longitudinal resistance , @xmath4 , which is measured in a photoconductivity experiment .    in more recent photoconductivity experiments , an enhanced cyclotron resonance amplitude in the adiabatic transport regime close to a current injecting contact @xcite was observed .",
    "the longitudinal resistance in the adiabatic regime at low temperatures and bias currents under illumination by a far - infrared laser was observed to show a sharp maximum @xcite at the cyclotron resonance .",
    "the authors concluded that the cyclotron resonance absorption process induces a nonequilibrium population of edge states .",
    "they infer that this also leads to inter - edge scattering ( i.e. to scattering events that are able to reverse the electrons direction of motion ) and thus to an increase in longitudinal resistance .",
    "this increase in resistance can be observed directly in photoconductivity @xcite and in magnetotransport @xcite .",
    "we investigate the photoconductivity properties of an antidot superlattice which allows us to excite the cyclotron resonance and the fundamental magnetoplasmon mode by illumination with thz - radiation .",
    "we find that at noninteger filling factors mainly resonant electron heating contributes to photoconductivity in both absorption processes . under adiabatic transport conditions at a filling factor of @xmath0 , on the contrary , only the cyclotron resonance ( cr ) is observed . here",
    ", in addition , the cr amplitude has a different dependence on the applied bias current than the magnetoplasmon and the cyclotron resonance amplitudes in the dissipative transport regime .",
    "this indicates that the photoresponse in the adiabatic transport regime is generated by a process different from electron heating which is mainly responsible for the photosignal in the dissipative regime .",
    "the sample investigated here is a square antidot superlattice with a period of 500  nm , fully covering the distance of @xmath5 between adjacent voltage probes on a @xmath5 wide hall bar ( fig .",
    "[ adots ] ) .",
    "the antidot - superlattice is prepared on a gaas / algaas heterostructure with a mobility ( at @xmath6 k ) of @xmath7 and an electron density @xmath8 in the unpatterned 2deg .",
    "the 2deg has a distance of 37  nm from the sample surface .",
    "the antidots are written by e - beam lithography and transferred into the 2deg by shallow wet etching . in the patterned region",
    "the density is smaller by about 7@xmath9 compared to the unpatterned 2deg .",
    "the antidots have a triangular shape ( width  =  300  nm , height  =  200  nm ) @xcite . however , this is not essential for the results presented here .",
    "we study the photoresponse , in particular the change in resistance @xmath10 in response to the thz - illumination , by measuring the photo - induced voltage @xmath11 between two voltage probes in four - point geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ adots ] .",
    "we apply dc bias currents @xmath12 of up to 10  @xmath13 between source and drain contacts .",
    "the bath temperature during the measurements is 4.2  k , and magnetic fields of up to 12  t are applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2deg .",
    "we use a broad - band mercury lamp to irradiate our samples .",
    "the light source is modulated by a fourier - transform - spectrometer to spectrally analyze the measured photoresponse @xmath11 . in the spectral range of interest to us , between 0 and @xmath14 ( 0 to 6 thz ) , the hg lamp has an integrated intensity of a few micro - watts .",
    "in fig .  [ 02131484t](a ) typical data in the dissipative regime at a magnetic field of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and a bias current of @xmath17 applied from the source to the drain contact are shown .",
    "as can be seen there , we detect the cyclotron resonance ( cr ) and a magnetoplasmon resonance ( mp ) .",
    "the photoresponse @xmath18 was recorded between contacts 3 and 4 .",
    "[ 02131484t](b ) shows a spectrum taken at the reference section on the same hall bar ( contacts 1 and 2 ) .",
    "there only the cyclotron resonance is resolved .",
    "we record the photoresponse spectra for a series of magnetic fields between 0 and 12  t and fit the spectral resonance position of the magnetoplasmon as a function of the applied magnetic field by the formula @xmath19 @xcite@xcite to extrapolate the zero - magnetic - field plasmon frequency @xmath20 .",
    "this @xmath20 is compared to the calculated frequency @xmath21 of a plasmon in a two - dimensional electron gas with a two - dimensional modulation of the charge density with periods @xmath22 and @xmath23 along the @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions , respectively .",
    "we determine @xmath21 from sample - specific parameters via the formula @xcite@xcite    @xmath26    where in our case @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the 2d electron density , @xmath29 the effective mass , @xmath30 the wave - vector as defined by the above formula and @xmath31 the effective dielectric constant .",
    "for @xmath31 we use@xcite @xmath32,where the distance @xmath33 of the 2deg from the sample surface equals @xmath34 in our samples .",
    "the effective mass @xmath35 is deduced from the frequency of the cyclotron resonance , measured in the reference section .",
    "we fit our data by the @xmath36 mode and obtain very good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "therefore , the resonance beside the cyclotron resonance is identified as the fundamental ( 1,0 ) or the degenerate ( 0,1 ) magnetoplasmon mode in the superlattice .",
    "figure [ 031780t](a ) shows photoconductivity spectra taken at a magnetic field of b  =  8.0  t ( corresponding to a filling factor of @xmath37 of the 2deg ) for bias currents applied between source and drain contacts ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 in steps of @xmath40 .",
    "as expected , with no bias current applied no photoconductivity is observed ( curve @xmath41 ) . for bias currents of @xmath42 both the cyclotron resonance ( cr ) and the magnetoplasmon ( mp ) are observed in the photoresponse @xmath18 and have a large amplitude already . for higher bias currents up to @xmath43 the photoresponse amplitude in the cyclotron resonance slightly increases and finally decreases again .",
    "the photoresponse amplitude in the magnetoplasmon absorption , on the other hand , decreases monotonically .",
    "[ 031780t](b ) shows data analogous to those in fig .  [",
    "031780t](a ) , but for a magnetic field of @xmath44 , corresponding to a filling factor of @xmath45 . under these conditions , up to high bias - currents of @xmath46 only the cyclotron resonance is observed , but not the magnetoplasmon .",
    "only for very high bias currents of @xmath43 a magnetoplasmon - induced photoresponse is beginning to develop .",
    "the amplitude of the cyclotron resonance increases linearly with increasing bias current .    for a filling factor of @xmath47 ( b  =  7.2  t ) ( not shown ) both the cyclotron resonance and the magnetoplasmon",
    "are observed in the photoresponse , but the magnetoplasmon only for bias currents higher than about @xmath48 .",
    "summarizing , at integer filling factor @xmath0 of the 2deg only the cyclotron resonance is observed in photoresponse . at @xmath49",
    "both the magnetoplasmon and the cyclotron resonance are observed in photoresponse .",
    "figure [ 0317ui ] shows the amplitudes of the spectra from figs .",
    "[ 031780t](a ) and [ 031780t](b ) as a function of the bias current between source and drain .",
    "open circles correspond to the cyclotron resonance maximum , black dots to the magnetoplasmon signal .",
    "the dashed interpolating lines are guides to the eye only . for comparison ,",
    "the differential longitudinal resistance @xmath50 as a function of the bias current , recorded in the same geometry as the photoresponse , is plotted ( solid line ) .",
    "figure [ 0317ui ] demonstrates that the amplitude of the magnetoplasmon signal qualitatively follows the differential longitudinal resistance @xmath50 for different magnetic fields ( filling factors ) .",
    "it will be shown in the following that therefore the magnetoplasmon signal can be explained by heating of the electron gas corresponding to the bolometric model @xcite .    in the bolometric model the photoresponse of a sample",
    "is regarded as a change in the voltage ( or resistance or conductivity , depending on whether a voltage , resistance or conductivity is measured in the specific sample geometry ) caused by an increased electron temperature . in our case , the longitudinal voltage is measured in a four point geometry ( fig .  [ adots ] ) .",
    "thus the photoresponse corresponds , in terms of the bolometric model , to a temperature - induced change in the longitudinal voltage @xmath51 .",
    "the increase in electron temperature , @xmath52 , is provided by the resonant absorption of the thz radiation .",
    "since the absorption coefficient does not strongly depend on magnetic field or filling factor and since filling factor - induced oscillations of the electronic specific heat are rather weak , we can for simplicity assume that @xmath52 does not depend on magnetic field or filling factor in the present , small signal limit .",
    "thus , the photoresponse is determined by the dependence @xmath53 of the voltage u on temperature .",
    "on the other hand , a sufficiently high bias current @xmath12 also produces an increase in electron temperature .",
    "thus the differential @xmath54 , is directly proportional to @xmath53 .    the amplitude of the magnetoplasmon - induced photoresponse as a function of bias - current @xmath12 resembles very much the differential longitudinal resistance @xmath54 and thus @xmath53 .",
    "thus the bolometric model can describe the photoresponse mechanism at the magnetoplasmon resonance as heating of the electron gas .    a nonzero longitudinal voltage @xmath55 is , on the other hand , a rough measure for the amount of conduction through bulk , dissipative electronic states .",
    "thus the appearence of the magnetoplasmon in photoconductivity can be taken for an indicator of beginning bulk conductivity .    for @xmath37 ( b  =  8  t )",
    "the amplitude of the cyclotron resonance has a behaviour similiar to that of the magnetoplasmon ( fig .  [ 0317ui](a ) ) , even though the features occur at higher bias currents . for @xmath56 or b  =  6.8  t ( fig .  [ 0317ui](c ) ) ,",
    "in contrast , the amplitude of the cyclotron resonance signal increases linearly with increasing bias current while the amplitude of the magnetoplasmon response and the longitudinal resistance ( solid line ) stay almost zero up to bias currents of @xmath46 .",
    "the suppression of the magnetoplasmon and the vanishing longitudinal resistance indicate that the 2d - bulk is still insulating .",
    "thus only the edge - states contribute to the conductance at an external magnetic field of b  =  6.8  t ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , we attribute the cyclotron resonance part of the photoresponse at @xmath0 to backscattering of the topmost edge states . at b  =  8  t",
    "probably both mechanisms are important , as will be discussed below .    summarizing the discussion ,",
    "the magnetoplasmon absorption leads to a photoresponse only in the dissipative transport regime , when the 2d - bulk is conducting , which also manifests itself in a nonzero ( differential ) longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath57 .",
    "the cyclotron resonance absorption leads to a photoresponse also in the adiabatic transport regime , when only the edge - states contribute to electric conductance .    as for the mechanism of backscattering",
    "we follow the argumentation of diessel _ et al . _ and propose that the absorption of thz radiation at the cyclotron resonance in the regime of the qhe at @xmath58 leads to a nonequilibrium population of edge states and thus to an enhanced inter - edge scattering rate , i.e.  rate of backscattering from one edge of the hall bar through the insulating bulk region to the other edge .    in the case of an antidot superlattice",
    "as studied here , not only the extended edge states at the boundaries of the hall bar exist , but also localized states around the antidots .",
    "we propose that backscattering in our superlattice takes place in several steps via the current loops localized around the antidots .",
    "we will now briefly discuss our data for different other filling factors ( magnetic fields ) . at a filling factor of @xmath47 ( b  =  7.2  t ) ( fig .  [ 0317ui](b ) )",
    "the cyclotron resonance behaves similiar to @xmath0 ( b  =  6.8  t ) ( fig .",
    "[ 0317ui]c ) .",
    "magnetoplasmon amplitude and @xmath2 are both almost zero for small bias - currents below 2@xmath59a and then increase in a way very similiar to each other .",
    "this is explained as follows : for low bias - currents below @xmath60 the sample is in an adiabatic state of conductance and only the cyclotron resonance absorption produces a photoresponse .",
    "for higher bias - currents bulk transport is beginning to be thermally activated , such that the sample is in a dissipative state now .",
    "correspondingly also the magnetoplasmon absorption generates a photoresponse . at a magnetic field of b  =  6.2  t , still in the plateau region of @xmath2 around integer filling factor @xmath45 ( not shown ) , the data are very similiar to those for @xmath0 ( b  =  6.8  t ) ( fig .  [ 0317ui]c ) .",
    "the reason for this is , that  up to bias - currents of @xmath61  the 2deg is still in an adiabatic state ( @xmath2 is still vanishing ) .",
    "thus only the cr absorption generates a photoresponse . for a filling factor of @xmath62 ( b  =  8.6  t ) ( not shown ) , where @xmath2 is nonzero the data resemble those for @xmath63 ( b  =  8  t ) ( where @xmath64 as well ) ( fig .",
    "[ 0317ui](a ) ) .",
    "this is because the 2deg is in a dissipative state .",
    "thus both cr and mp absorption lead to a photoresponse .",
    "now there remains to be discussed _",
    "why _ the magnetoplasmon is visible in the photoresponse in the dissipative transport regime only , but the cyclotron resonance occurs both in the dissipative and the adiabatic transport regimes , i.e. why only cr absorption is able to induce backscattering of edge - states .",
    "the extent of the edge - states into the 2d - bulk is comparable to the edge depletion length , which is of the order of a few 100  nm .",
    "the characteristic coherence length @xmath65 of a collective excitation with a frequency / wave vector - dependence @xmath66 is generally equal to @xmath67 with the scattering time @xmath68 . for the magnetoplasmon in our samples we have @xmath69",
    "this means that the magnetoplasmon excitation has its full strength only a distance @xmath69 away from the sample boundaries , i.e. deep in the 2d - bulk . at the location of the edge states ,",
    "not much more than 100  nm away from the boundaries , the magnetoplasmon has almost vanished .",
    "when only the edge - states contribute to electric conduction , as is the case under adiabatic transport conditions , the magnetoplasmon in the 2d - bulk can not be converted into a photoresponse .",
    "this conversion could only be done by the edge - states , but at the location of the edge - states the magnetoplasmon oscillation strength is already negligible .",
    "the characteristic length for the cyclotron resonance is the magnetic length .",
    "even though the cyclotron resonance as a collective phenomenon is affected by finite - size effects up to macroscopic dimensions @xcite , it is sensitive to the local potential landscape even in the nm - range @xcite .",
    "thus absorption in the cyclotron resonance can be converted into a photoresponse also by the edge states .",
    "we have examined cyclotron resonance- and magnetoplasmon - induced changes in the longitudinal voltage of an antidot superlattice in high magnetic fields by means of photoconductivity measurements . in the dissipative transport regime",
    "we detect both magnetoplasmon and cyclotron resonances in the photoresponse . in the adiabatic transport regime at integer bulk",
    "filling factor @xmath45 we detect only the cyclotron resonance in the photoresponse . to explain these experimental results , i.e. the different dependencies of the amplitudes of the photoresponse in the cyclotron resonance and in the magnetoplasmon resonance on the applied bias current at different filling factors , we suggest a model , wherein different mechanisms generate photoconductivity in the magnetoplasmon resonance and in the cyclotron resonance , respectively .",
    "according to this model electron heating is responsible for photoconductivity in the dissipative transport regime . in the regime of adiabatic transport at integer filling factor @xmath0 the photoresponse is generated by backscattering of the topmost edge state , and this backscattering can be caused by the cyclotron resonance only .",
    "the reason for why only the cr can cause backscattering of edge states is that cyclotron and magnetoplasmon resonances have different characteristic lengths .",
    "the characteristic length of the cyclotron resonance is comparable to the lateral extent of the edge - states , thus cr absorption can induce backscattering of edge - states .",
    "the characteristic length of the magnetoplasmon is by almost an order of magnitude larger than the lateral extent of the edge - states , thus mp absorption can_not _ induce backscattering of edge - states .",
