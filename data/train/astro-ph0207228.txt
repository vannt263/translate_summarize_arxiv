    "when two stars ( or other bodies ) come into close alignment on the sky , the foreground star may either eclipse or microlens the background star . as the stars align , if the angular size of the foreground star is much larger than its gravitational deflection angle , then the foreground star can eclipse ; if the contrary is true then it can magnify . more precisely , gravitational lensing by a point mass produces two images of a distant object , one interior and one exterior to the einstein radius in the lens plane , @xmath0^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath1 is the gravitational radius for a lens of mass @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the distances to the lens or source .",

    ", the inner image can become unocculted if the lens is smaller than the einstein radius ( figure 1 ) .",
    "occultation is most important in microlensing if @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radius of the lens star ( assumed to be spherical ) . in galactic microlensing ,",
    "typically @xmath6 , so the occultation of the inner image occurs , but is usually rather faint .",
    "in special circumstances , such as in eclipsing binaries containing compact objects @xcite or lensing by giant stars , @xmath7 , so the effects of both microlensing and occultation must be included .",

    "we summarize .",
    "the lensing equation for a point source and point lens , neglecting diffraction and strong relativistic effects , is @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the image and source position angles in units of @xmath11 . in the limit that the source is much smaller than the einstein radius and",
    "is not aligned with the lens , then the point - source magnification is an adequate approximation @xcite . solving this equation ,",
    "the image positions are @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the image interior to the einstein radius and @xmath14 is the image exterior to the einstein radius ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "the magnifications of the images are @xmath17 or @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "if the size of the lens star is less than the size of the einstein radius , @xmath20 , then the inner image will be occulted for @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath22 , which means that the inner image is occulted when the source is distant from the lens and unoccults when the source approaches the lens .",

    "however , if the images can be resolved directly and the demagnified inner image is brighter than the lens star , then appearance of the inner image might be detectable .    if the size of the lens star is greater than the einstein radius , @xmath26 , then the inner image is always occulted and the outer image will be occulted for @xmath27 which corresponds to @xmath28 . during occultation",
    "the source star disappears so that one can only see the lens star .",
    "thus , the total magnification for microlensing of a point source is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the step - function . in the limit @xmath31",
    ", this reduces to the usual microlensing magnification @xcite , while in the limit @xmath32 , @xmath33 is negligible , @xmath34 , and occultation simply occurs when @xmath35 .    at the point of occultation , @xmath36 , and",
    "since @xmath10 can be measured from a fit to the microlensing lightcurve , one can measure @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the sign is determined by whether the image appears ( @xmath38 ) or disappears ( @xmath39 ) at the center of the event .",
    "the average astrometric position of the images during the microlensing event is @xcite @xmath40 where the difference in image position is measured with respect to the position of the lens on the sky .",
    "when @xmath25 , then the change in position during occultation of the inner image is @xmath41 this has a weaker dependence on @xmath37 than the magnitude change , but will still be quite small unless @xmath42 . in the case where @xmath43 , then the source will be completely occulted , so the centroid change is simply @xmath44    the point source approximation has two limitations :",
    "during eclipse ingress or egress , the finite size of the source causes a smooth transition , and if the surface brightness of the source and lens are similar and @xmath45 , then the source must also have have a size similar to the einstein radius to contribute a significant fraction of the flux .",
    "thus , in the next section we derive a more general formula including the finite extent of the source .",
    "in the case of a circular source with uniform surface brightness , the images may be partly or fully eclipsed by the lens star .",
    "the magnification ( or dimming ) is equal to the ratio of the unocculted area of the images to the area of the unlensed source since surface brightness is conserved during lensing . for a uniform source the area can be computed by integrating over the image boundaries using stokes theorem @xcite . in the case of a point - mass lens ,",
    "this integral can be solved analytically as first shown by @xcite for @xmath31 . for an extended source with normalized radius @xmath46",
    "it is more useful to define a two - dimensional lensing equation to integrate over the source . @xcite",
    "define a complex lensing equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the complex coordinate for the source plane in units of @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the complex coordinate for the lens plane in units of @xmath51 . comparing to equation [ lenseq ] , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we assume that the source has a uniform surface brightness in the region @xmath54",

    "the lensing magnification for a uniform source is simply the ratio of the area of the lensed images to the area of the source .",
    "the integral over area can be converted to an integral over the source boundary using stokes theorem @xcite , giving @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the position angle of the image .",
    "the total magnification is @xmath62 in case of a finite - sized lens , @xmath63 should be replaced in the integrand with @xmath64 whenever @xmath65 . in other words ,",
    "when an image is partially occulted , then the inner boundary is given by the edge of the lens , while the outer boundary is given by the edge of the outer image .",
    "there are several different cases to consider :    1 .",
    "@xmath66 : point source ( equation [ pointmag ] ) ; 2 .",

    "@xmath67 , @xmath69 : extended source , inner image fully occulted , outer image may be partly occulted .",
    "the expressions for @xmath70 in each of these cases are summarized in tables 1 and 2 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 superscripts refer to the point - source magnification @xcite , extended - source magnification @xcite , or occulted - extended source magnification ( below ) , respectively and @xmath73 .",
    "each of the magnification expressions in tables 1 and 2 are given in equations [ pointmag ] and [ firsteq]-[lasteq ] , with the the range of the variables for which the functions apply given in the columns .",
    "as an example of how the computation proceeds , we consider the case in which @xmath69 and the source overlaps the shadow of the lens ( for example , the source in figure 1(d ) at @xmath74 ) . in this case",
    "the inner image is completely occulted while the outer image is partially occulted , so we must integrate equation [ stoke ] for @xmath75 between @xmath76 $ ] .",

    "a uniform source causes rather sharp features in the lightcurve during the ingress and egress of the occultation , and leads to flatter lightcurves during transit .",
    "however , a limb - darkened source has a smoother ingress / egress and has curvature during a transit .",
    "thus , in the next section we consider microlensing and occultation of a limb - darkened source .",
    "limb darkening causes a star to be more centrally peaked in brightness compared to a uniform source .",
    "this leads to larger magnification during microlensing or larger dimming during transit / occultation .",
    "thus , including limb - darkening is important for computing accurate microlensing / occultation lightcurves . describing limb - darkening with a quadratic law @xmath107 where @xmath108 , leads to a magnification of @xmath109^{-1 } \\int_0^{r_s } dr i(r ) { d \\mu r^2 \\over dr},\\ ] ] where @xmath110 can be computed from the expressions in the previous section ( replacing @xmath111 with @xmath112 ) .",
    "we could use a more accurate limb - darkening formula , but rely on a quadratic law for simplicity .",
    "given the complicated dependence of the magnification on the radius , this integral is best done numerically using a finite - difference approximation for the derivative of the uniform magnification .",
    "an example is shown in figure 6 - in this case the dip during occultation is deeper due to limb - darkening since the source is brighter at the center , and thus more flux is lost , and the magnification decreases toward the origin rather than increasing as in the uniform source case . both the uniform and the limb - darkened cases are shallower when compared to the pure occultation case due to magnification of the background source . a second example is shown in figure 7 . in this case",
    "the limb - darkening causes a weaker magnification as the outer limb is magnified , while the peak is increased due to the more concentrated brightness . in the special case that @xmath113 , the integral is tractable analytically as follows , and is shown as the solid dots in figures 6 and 7 .",

    "we can include limb - darkening exactly in this case @xcite .",

    "the equations for microccultation are most relevant for equality of the einstein radius and lens radius which occurs if @xmath131 .",
    "we compute @xmath132 for several interesting objects in table 3 ( not to be confused with their actual distances ) , including a white dwarf ( sirius b ) , brown dwarf ( gliese 229b ) , red giant ( capella ) , blue supergiant ( rigel ) , yellow supergiant ( deneb ) , and red supergiant ( betelgeuse ) .",
    "application of the microccultation equations to white dwarfs , brown - dwarfs , nearby supergiants , and giants in globular clusters are discussed next .",
    "white dwarfs in eclipsing binaries are the most likely location to see microccultation @xcite .",
    "known white - dwarf binaries which transit their companions have small semi - major axes ( likely a selection effect ) , and thus small einstein radii , changing the depth of transit by only a few percent @xcite . due to common - envelope evolution ,",
    "white - dwarf binaries have typical semi - major axes @xmath133 au and masses of @xmath134 , so @xmath135 .",
    "this is comparable to the size of white dwarfs , @xmath136 cm , so both occultation and microlensing will be important .",
    "@xcite apply the formulae derived here to estimate how many white dwarfs may be found in transit searches for extrasolar planets .",
    "for example , the kepler survey @xcite may find @xmath137 white dwarfs , comparable to the expected number of terrestrial planets .",
    "white dwarf transit events will require including both lensing and occultation in modeling the lightcurves .    though smaller in mass , brown dwarfs in eclipsing binaries may have some observable microlensing effects during eclipse . as gas planets and brown dwarfs",
    "have very similar sizes , their transits of companion stars may look quite similar .",
    "however , in the limit of a large source the depth of the transit scales as @xmath138 ( for a uniform source ) , so brown dwarfs will have a transit of smaller depth since @xmath51 is larger .",
    "this will affect the measurement of limb - darkening which also changes the depth of the transit ( equation [ limbmag1 ] ) . in the case of a 0.05 @xmath139 brown dwarf with radius @xmath140 in orbit at 1 au about a g - type star , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the transit depth differs by @xmath143 from a @xmath144 planet of the same radius . such photometric precision can be obtained with hst @xcite and other planned satellites , and will be indicated by a slight brightening outside of the transit ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the difference can be much larger , @xmath145% , if the primary is also a brown dwarf .",
    "lensing events caused by nearby stars may also show the signs of both microlensing and occultation .",
    "the most extreme case is the star betelgeuse which has a distance of @xmath146 pc and a mass of @xmath147 , giving an einstein radius of @xmath148 cm for sources at much larger distance .",
    "this is only slightly larger than the size of betelgeuse , @xmath149 cm , so that distant stars passing behind betelgeuse would create two visible images as they approach ; a full occultation would never occur ( unless the mass of betelgeuse were much smaller ) .",
    "distant galaxies would create an einstein ring surrounding the star with the center occulted .",
    "the challenge involved in carrying out such an observation is resolving a faint background source from the bright foreground star and waiting long enough for betelgeuse to pass in front of a star or galaxy . in every microlensing event",
    "an occultation should occur when @xmath150 . since this usually leads to a demagnified image ,",
    "extremely accurate photometry is necessary to see an occultation event .",
    "a final application of the microccultation equations is to giant stars acting as lenses in globular clusters .",
    "there are about @xmath151 evolved giant stars in milky way globular clusters . for a giant star at the clump with a mass of @xmath152 , the einstein radius for a separation of 1 pc",
    "is @xmath153 , comparable to the size of the star , @xmath153 .",
    "if the relative velocity is @xmath154 km / s then red giants in globular clusters cover about @xmath155 @xmath156 yr@xmath157 which is about @xmath158 of the total area in globular clusters .",
    "thus , about @xmath159 stars in globular clusters must be monitored to find a single red giant transit event per year and a typical event will last about one month .",
    "a lightcurve of a lensing event by a red giant in a globular cluster would allow one to measure @xmath37 and @xmath111 , as well as @xmath160 and @xmath161 for the source star . since the einstein radius in this case is @xmath162^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath132 is the separation of the lenses in the cluster , one can estimate the surface gravity of the lens giant , @xmath163 @xcite , given that @xmath132 will be of order the scale - length of the globular cluster .",
    "we have computed exact formulae for lensing of a uniform extended source by an opaque , spherical lens ( with escape velocity much smaller than @xmath164 ) .",
    "the formulae only differ significantly from the usual occultation or microlensing formulae in the limit that @xmath7 , which may be relevant for lensing by white dwarfs in binaries or lensing by giant stars .",
    "small deviations due to lensing in eclipsing brown - dwarf binaries may be detectable with very precise photometry , which may be another application of the expressions derived here .",
