    "in this notes we would like to give a self contained introduction into the subject of calibrated geometries @xcite while setting the focus on the important example of @xmath0-calibrated geometries .",
    "calibrated geometries arise in supergravity and string theory quite naturally in the investigation of classical solutions of the equations of motion ( eom ) , which preserve some amount of supersymmetry for the case of 11d supergravity some important examples of brane solutions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "( killing spinors ) @xcite .",
    "typical examples are provided by the widely used brane solutions @xcite . nowadays",
    "the application of calibrated geometries is one of the main computational tools in supergravity and string theory and the objective of current research .",
    "therefore an understanding of the basic concepts is very useful @xcite . in recent years",
    "the attempts to provide a full classification of supersymmetric solutions of all supergravities of physical interest have benefited a lot from the progress in understanding ( generalised ) calibrations @xcite .",
    "further work in this direction may be performed and belongs certainly to the most inspiring developments in supergravity and string theory , nowadays . to set the scene we want to motivate the origin of calibrated geometries by giving a simple example . for this purpose",
    "we consider branes , which prove to be generic supersymmetric solutions of supergravities and are most important in applications .",
    "one can also look at them from a different point of view .",
    "rather then considering them as solutions of a given supergravity one might regard them as dynamical objects moving in a fixed supergravity background , too .",
    "the action from which the dynamics of the brane in the background follows is called p - brane action @xcite .",
    "[ bsp1 ] in a flat background and in the absence of other gauge fields the p - brane action governing the dynamics is simply the volume functional of the brane embedded into flat d - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the solutions of the corresponding equations of motion are minimal surfaces . if @xmath1 is the embedding map and for simplicity we assume it describes effectively the embedding of a 2-manifold @xmath2 into @xmath3 , i.e. + @xmath4 + with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "if the bound is saturated , i.e. the equality sign holds , one obtains a peculiar geometry given by the equation + @xmath15 + i.e. the pullback of the khler form @xmath16 is the volume form on @xmath2 .",
    "this statement is a local one . according to wirtingers theorem",
    "this is a property characteristic of complex submanifolds of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "so the surfaces calibrated with respect to the khler form @xmath16 are just the complex submanifolds of @xmath17 .",
    "similar bounds but formally different geometries can be established by utilising one of the other three squares in @xmath18 , too this seems to be ambiguous . a complete resolution of this ambiguity will be given in this review . .",
    "+    * ( preliminary ) :* a calibration consists of a closed differential form @xmath16 , which provides a lower bound for the volume of a brane solution such that for all submanifolds @xmath19 @xmath20 when evaluated on any tangent plane . if a submanifold ( brane ) saturates the bound we call it calibrated .",
    "the saturation of the bound can be translated into constraints on the geometry of the submanifold ( brane ) .    in the next sections we want to develop an understanding for the interplay of closed differential forms defining a calibration and geometrical constraints . in order to be as explicit as possible",
    "we limit ourself to a detailed study of the simplest but nevertheless nontrivial example of @xmath0-calibrated geometry .",
    "the reason for calling it a @xmath0- calibrated geometry will become clear later .",
    "the advantage of @xmath0-calibrations is , that everything can be computed easily and so most insight into the subject is possible .",
    "it can be seen as a role model for more sophisticated constructions of calibrated geometries @xcite .",
    "there exists other reviews , which might be consulted for further reading @xcite .",
    "here we choose the following strategy .",
    "as was pointed out in example [ bsp1 ] the study of the local geometry is enough in order to derive the constraints ( differential equations ) governing the geometry of the manifold .",
    "therefore our plan is to start with a formal discussion of the local geometry of @xmath0-calibrated submanifolds by studying the geometry of two planes in @xmath21 in section [ sec_g24 ] , first @xcite .",
    "having achieved a complete understanding of the geometries we want to investigate the whole topic from the perspective often taken in string theory in section [ sec_stringpict ] @xcite .",
    "here we rederive the @xmath0-conditions from the string picture in the case of an d2-d4 bound state @xcite .",
    "finally we generalise the recipe to generate the differential equations to the case of @xmath22-calibrations in section [ sec_slac_d ] @xcite .",
    "the grassmanian of 2-planes in @xmath3 is defined through : + @xmath24 + i.e. as a subset of the six dimensional space @xmath25 .",
    "its elements are 2-planes generated by two vectors dual to the two 1-forms @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "+ we would like to study the structure of the manifold @xmath23 .",

    "we compute the norm of the three vector obtained via the projection of @xmath34 into the `` + ' ' -eigenspace of @xmath31 .",
    "the following equation holds this is due to the definition of the scalar product of two differential p - forms @xmath41 .",
    "here vol denotes the volume form . : + @xmath42 + setting @xmath43 merely reflects the fact that the area spanned by normed vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 is equal to one .",
    "we obtain the result that the three `` vector '' @xmath44 is of norm 1/2 .",
    "+ the general element of @xmath45 can be written as the three `` vector '' + @xmath46 + using the following abbreviation @xmath47 the following identity holds : + @xmath48 + comparing the previous result of the norm of @xmath44 with the latter identity one obtains + @xmath49 + i.e. the vector @xmath50 associated with @xmath44 is of unit norm .",
    "a completely analogous result holds for the `` - '' eigenspace : + @xmath51 + basically the vector @xmath50 associated with @xmath52 is again of unit norm .",
    "in addition for two 2-forms belonging to the `` + '' and the `` - '' eigenspaces , respectively , the formula + @xmath53 + holds , i.e. the decomposition is an orthogonal one .",
