    "the weighted superposition mechanism ( wsm ) of two properly defined classes of events explains several experimental facts @xcite ( shoulder structure in @xmath0 vs @xmath1 , quasi - oscillatory behaviour of @xmath2 vs @xmath3 , energy dependence of forward - backward multiplicity correlations ) which altogether characterise collective variables properties in high energy  collisions and  annihilation . in  collisions",
    "the two classes of events are the soft one ( without mini - jets ) and the semi - hard one ( with mini - jets ) ; in annihilation one distinguishes between two - jet and three - jet samples of events .",
    "it should be pointed out that the qualifying assumption of the wsm is that the multiplicity distribution ( md ) is described for each class of events in terms of the pascal , , negative binomial ( nb ) , md ; its characteristic parameters are @xmath4 , , the average charged particle multiplicity , and @xmath5 ( linked to the variance @xmath6 by the relation @xmath7 . )",
    "this assumption leads to a sound description of the experimental data .",
    "the nb ( pascal ) md is well known in high energy physics and has been justified in the framework of qcd .    in extrapolating the wsm from the gev to the tev energy domain @xcite for  collisions ,",
    "it was found that , in the scenarios most favoured by tevatron results , the semi - hard component is characterised by a decrease of the average number of clans , @xmath8 , and by a corresponding increase of the average number of particles per clan , @xmath9 , as the c.m .",
    "energy increases from 900 gev to 14 tev .",
    "it seems that van der waals - like cohesive forces are at work among clans .",
    "somehow , clan aggregation is occurring and , accordingly , particle population density per clan is expected to become larger as the c.m.energy increases .",
    "aggregation will of course be maximal when the average number of clans reaches 1 : under which conditions the decrease of the average number of clans to one unit could be extrapolated to 14 tev ? furthermore , assuming that these conditions are verified at 14 tev , are they related to asymptotic properties the semi - hard component or are they the benchmark of a new class of events , , of a third component to be added to the soft and semi - hard ones ? it should be pointed out that the onset of a third class of events in terms of a second shoulder in @xmath0 vs @xmath1 is suggested in minimum bias events in full phase - space also by monte carlo calculations with pythia version 6.210 , with default parameters but using a double - gaussian matter distribution ( so - called ` model 4 ' ) .",
    "coming to the first part of the above question , since one is forced to exclude that a sudden decrease of the average number of clans to one unit could be anticipated in the semi - hard component at 14 tev c.m.energy ( it would imply , quite unlikely , heavy discontinuities in @xmath10 and @xmath11 general behaviours ) , it is proposed to consider the following relation as the benchmark of a new class of events : @xmath12 which indeed implies @xmath13 .",
    "we start by describing the general shape of the md : the kno plot reveals that events with multiplicities smaller than the average are numerous , while events with multiplicities larger than the average are less probable although they extend to very large multiplicities .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath5 parameter , as well known , is related to the integral of the two - particle correlation function .",
    "thus one obtains @xmath14 because @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; this indicates that two - particle correlations in the new component are much larger than in the semi - hard component , a confirmation of particle aggregation .",
    "in addition , since @xmath17 controls @xmath1-factorial cumulant moments behaviour at any order @xmath1 , @xmath18 is expected to be much larger than @xmath19 .",
    "finally , let us consider the strength of forward - backward multiplicity correlations , @xmath20 : it was established in @xcite that in the framework of clan structure analysis @xmath21^{1/2 } }      =   \\frac { 2 { { b}_{\\text{iii } } } { { p}_{\\text{iii } } }            ( 1- { { p}_{\\text{iii } } }   ) } { 1   - 2   { { b}_{\\text{iii } } }             { { p}_{\\text{iii } } } ( 1-{{p}_{\\text{iii } } } ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the ` leakage parameter ' , , the fraction of particles of one clan which do not leak to the hemisphere opposite to where the clan was first emitted ( @xmath24 ) . being for the third class @xmath25 , with @xmath26 one should have @xmath27 and since for @xmath28 the corresponding leakage controlling fb multiplicity correlations close to its maximum ( leakage parameter close to 1/2 ) one obtains that @xmath29 and fb multiplicity correlations in the third component are much stronger than in the semi - hard class of events .",
    "this appears to be an indication , in view of the extremely high virtuality and hardness of these events , of a huge colour exchange process at parton level of which strong fb multiplicity correlations are presumably the hadronic signature .    in conclusion , in this framework one should expect to see at 14 tev in  collisions three classes of events , each one described by a nb ( pascal ) md or by one of its limiting values :    \\1 . the class of soft events with @xmath30 constant as the c.m .",
    "energy increases ;    \\2 .",
    "the class of semi - hard events with @xmath11 which decreases as the c.m .",
    "energy increases ;    \\3 .",
    "the class of hard events with @xmath25 and @xmath31 , , @xmath32    the total @xmath1 charged particle md @xmath33 should therefore be written as follows : @xmath34 with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the weight factors of the three classes of events with respect to the total sample of events .    assuming that at 14 tev the third class of events is 2% of the total sample of events and that @xmath39 and extrapolating @xmath36 and @xmath37 from their behaviour in the gev energy range @xcite one gets in full phase - space ( fps ) the numbers in table  [ tab : ii ] ( notice that small variations of @xmath40 below 0.12 in equation ( [ eq:4prime ] ) give @xmath41 . )    in the pseudo - rapidity interval @xmath42 , assuming that the clan is either ( i ) spread out over all the phase - space or ( ii ) concentrated in @xmath43 , the results in table  [ tab : ii ] are obtained . for more details , see @xcite .",

    "it should be stessed that informations coming from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) do not help to understand this behaviour , which is a peculiar property of hadron - hadron scattering ; indeed the clan size in dis tends to have a leptonic character ( contrary to the average number of clans which tends to be hadronic ) @xcite ."
