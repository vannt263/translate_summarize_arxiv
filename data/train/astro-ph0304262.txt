    "recent advances in understanding the nature of @xmath0 centauri , the most massive milky way globular cluster ( @xmath3 m@xmath2 , meylan _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , have now placed on a firmer ground its accretion origin as opposed to formation within the milky way . unlike the majority of the milky way globular clusters ,",
    "@xmath0 cen is a complex chemical system with an extended star formation history .",
    "for instance , the multiple - peak metallicity distribution ( e. g. , pancino _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , the correlation between age and metallicity ( e.g. , hughes & wallerstein 2000 ) , and the s - process heavy - element enhanced enrichment in cluster stars ( e.g. , smith _ et al . _ 2000 ) argue for a star formation history of 2 to 4 gyr .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between the enhancement of s - process elements with metallicity argues for a self - enrichment process within this system ( vanture , wallerstein & suntzeff 2002 ) as opposed to the build - up of the whole system by merging a few chemically distinct fragments .",
    "( 2002 ) show that the present - day @xmath0 cen is not unique among globular clusters in its ability to retain its own stellar ejecta , but its frequent passages through the galactic disk should have swept out all of the s - process enriched gas from agb stars .",
    "this is the case for all of the globular clusters within 10 kpc of the galactic center , but not for @xmath0 cen .",
    "the internal kinematics of @xmath0 cen lend further support to an accretion origin .",
    "the cluster rotates relatively rapidly causing an ellipticity of @xmath4 ( merritt , meylan , & mayor 1997 ) , while most of the galactic globular clusters have an ellipticity of @xmath5 ( majewski _ et al .",
    "however , the metal rich stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath6 ) in @xmath0 cen do not share the bulk rotation of the metal poor stars , and have a lower velocity dispersion ( norris _ et al .",
    "the metal rich stars also show a north - south elongation in contradistinction to the well - known east - west elongation of most of @xmath0 cen s stars ( pancino _ et al .",
    "the distinctive features of the metal - rich stars may be related to an accretion event within @xmath0 cen .    the extended star - formation history of @xmath0 cen , the presence of stars formed from agb - enriched gas , and the evidence of a merger / accretion event point to a formation of @xmath0 cen not only away from the milky way , but also at the bottom of the potential well of a massive galaxy .",
    "thus , we wish to explore a previously established hypothesis : @xmath0 cen is the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy captured and disrupted by the milky way ( freeman 1993 ) .",
    "a dwarf sinking to the center of the galaxy is subject to dynamical friction with simultaneous mass loss due to the interaction with the galactic tidal field .",
    "all of the dwarf is stripped off except for the nucleus which , presumably , is left with the present - day orbit of @xmath0 cen .",
    "this orbit is retrograde , of low energy and low inclination , and highly eccentric .",
    "it has an apocenter of only 6.4 kpc , a pericenter of @xmath7 kpc , and a period of 120 myr ( dinescu , girard , & van altena 1999 ) .",
    "can the capture scenario produce the current orbit of @xmath0 cen , and if so , under what conditions ?",
    "zhao ( 2002 ) made the first attempt to model this accretion event using a semi - analytical calculation .",
    "he found that , if the dwarf is launched from 50 kpc from the galactic center , the remnant will not decay to the present orbit .",
    "this is because strong tidal shocks reduce the mass to the point that dynamical friction becomes too inefficient to drag the system to the current low - energy orbit of @xmath0 cen .",
    "zhao s analysis was simplified by a number of assumptions .",
    "for instance , the mass outside the tidal radius is instantaneously stripped , and the bulge and disk contributions to the dynamical drag were not taken into account in the 50-kpc launch .",
    "we re - investigate the accretion scenario by means of n - body simulations in order to follow the evolution of a dwarf galaxy falling into the milky way .",
    "in our simulations , we use the model by kuijken and dubinski ( 1995 ) that reproduces closely an exact solution of the set of collisionless boltzmann and poisson equations .",
    "the parameters of the model have been determined based on the observed properties of the milky way .",
    "we assume the solar radius , the disk exponential scale length , and the disk vertical scale height to be 8 kpc , 3.5 kpc and 245 pc respectively .",
    "the circular velocity of the disk at the solar radius is taken to be 220 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the surface density within 1.1 kpc of the disk plane in the model is equal to 69.8 m@xmath2 pc@xmath9 with the disk contribution being 45.5 m@xmath2pc@xmath9 . with the generally accepted cutoff radius of the disk of 28 kpc , the disk s total mass in the model is 5 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath2 .",
    "the mass of the bulge is 0.75 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath2 within 2.4 kpc .",
    "the halo is approximated by a lowered isothermal sphere ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) with the central potential @xmath128 .",
    "the halo mass inside 50 kpc is 4.9 @xmath10 10@xmath13 m@xmath2 which is within the observationally inferred limits 5.4@xmath14 ( wilkinson & evans 1999 ) .",
    "a more detailed description of the milky way model can be found in tsuchiya ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have examined the dynamics of the disrupting dwarf galaxy using two different density profiles : 1 ) a king profile , or lowered isothermal density distribution ( king 1966 ) , and 2 ) a hernquist density profile ( hernquist 1990 ) .",
    "our king profile has a deep central potential ( @xmath15 ) with a density distribution in the central regions equivalent to an @xmath16 cusp within our numerical resolution .",
    "the highly - concentrated king profiles were chosen to model a satellite with a steep central density cusp in an attempt to mimic the nuclear region that would presumably end as an @xmath0 cen - like object .",
    "for the king profile , we have examined a set of six models whose total masses and half - mass radii are summarized in table 1 ( k1 through k6 ) .",
    "the hernquist model has a shallower density distribution than the king model , with an @xmath17 cusp in the central regions .",
    "we have examined nine models of the henquist profile whose parameters are also listed in table 1 ( h1 through h9 ) . in order to follow the dynamics of the central nucleus of a nucleated dwarf galaxy  as the hypothetical progenitor of @xmath0 cen  we place at the center of our preferred model dwarf galaxy an extended particle that has a mass of 10@xmath18 m@xmath2 , and @xmath19 pc .",
    "we then follow the evolution of the dwarf galaxy and its central nucleus until the nucleus sinks to an orbit close to the center of the milky way .",
    "a more detailed description of the simulations and results is given elsewhere ( tsuchia , korchagin , & dinescu 2003 ) .",
    "the simulations have been done with the self consistent field ( scf)-tree code that has a detailed description in tsuchiya ( 2002 ) .",
    "a hierarchical tree algorithm has been used to calculate the dynamics of the softened particles representing the disk , the bulge of the milky way , and the dynamics of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "we have used 70,000 particles to represent the disk , and 10,000 particles for the bulge .",
    "the results presented here make use of a rigid halo , to avoid a long computational time ; these models did not take into account dynamical friction on the halo .",
    "we have however tested one model ( i.e. , our preferred one , h4 , see table 1 , and the following section ) using a `` living '' halo . this halo has been modeled with the scf algorithm ( hernquist & ostriker 1992 ) . the halo distribution is sampled by 100,000 particles .",
    "we have taken the tolerance parameter to be 0.7 , and the softening length to be 0.01 of the disk scale length which corresponds to 35 pc in our milky way model .",
    "we found that the decay time for the simulation with the living halo is shorter than that for the rigid one ( 1.8 gyr versus 3 gyr ) , but the relation between the satellite s bound mass and apocenter distance is similar for the two halos ( tsuchia , korchagin , & dinescu 2003 ) .",
    "the king model dwarfs are sampled by 50,000 equal - mass particles . for the hernquist model dwarfs ,",
    "we adopt a multi - mass n - body model .",
    "this is because we need to achieve a better mass resolution in the central regions of the dwarf galaxy , as the hernquist model undergoes heavy mass loss down to @xmath20 m@xmath2 , while the king models stop losing mass at @xmath21 m@xmath2 ( see the next section ) .",
    "the hernquist distribution function has been divided into three energy groups .",
    "the lowest energy group is sampled by 50,000 particles with the mass of each particle being 2 @xmath10 10@xmath22 of the total mass of the dwarf .",
    "the middle and the highest energy groups are sampled by particles with masses 2@xmath10 10@xmath23 , and 2@xmath10 10@xmath24 of the total mass of the dwarf , respectively , and the number of particles in each group is 45,000 .",
    "the dwarf was hence sampled by 140,000 particles in total .",
    "the multi - mass model allows us to achieve a much better resolution of the dynamics of the central regions of the dwarf compared to that given by equal mass models .",
    "the dynamics of the central 10@xmath18 m@xmath2 of the dwarf is therefore sampled by approximately 50,000 particles .",
    "to approximately match the current orbit of @xmath0 cen , we have chosen the initial position and velocity of the satellite to be ( x , y , z ) = ( 50 , 0 , 30 ) kpc , and ( @xmath25 ) = ( 0 , -20 , 0 ) km s@xmath8 . here , x is positive away from the galactic center , y is positive toward galactic rotation , and z is positive toward the north galactic pole ; the sun is at ( x , y , z ) = ( 8 , 0 , 0 ) . due to the small initial velocity , the dwarf falls into a very eccentric orbit with a typical pericenter of @xmath7 kpc . at each pericentric passage , the dwarf experiences strong shocks mainly from the encounters with the bulge which strip off the dwarf s outer layers . simultaneously with the mass loss , the dwarf sinks into a smaller orbit .",
    "the king and the hernquist models have qualitatively different evolutionary sequences . in figure 1",
    "we show the bound mass ( at apocenter ) as a function of the apocentric distance for the king profiles ( fig .",
    "1 a ) and for the hernquist profiles ( fig 1 b ) . for the same total mass , the king models with higher central densities ( table 1 ) sink deeper . once the dwarf mass decreases to @xmath26 m@xmath2 , there is practically no more orbital decay .",
    "these models lose mass approximately exponentially with time .",
    "the ever decreasing mass - loss rate requires a time that is longer than the age of the galaxy in order to reach a remnant with a bound mass of @xmath27 m@xmath2 ( tsuchiya , korchagin & dinescu 2003 ) . for",
    "the hernquist model dwarfs the evolutionary sequences ( fig .",
    "1 b ) show that the orbit decay stops at a given radius that depends on the central density ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the dwarf continues to lose significant mass as opposed to the king models .",
    "in fact , all the models but h1 have completely dissolved after a time less than 5 gyr . from these tests ,",
    "we have chosen as our best representation of the progenitor of @xmath0 cen , model h4 . in figure 2",
    "we show the galactocentric distance of the center of mass of the tidally bound mass of the disrupting dwarf as a function of time for the model that includes the nucleus , and for the model that does nt ( see section 2 ) . after approximately 2 gyr from the beginning of the simulations , the model with the nucleus",
    "establishes itself into a low - energy orbit with pericentric and apocentric distances of about 1  kpc and 6  kpc .",
    "the time evolution of the galactocentric radius of the nucleated model illustrates that indeed the nucleus has near - stationary radial oscillations after 2.5 gyr ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the non - nucleated model is completely disrupted in 2 gyr .",
    "this is more clearly seen in figure 3 , where the mass of the gravitationally bound particles is shown as a function of time for the nucleated model , and the non - nucleated one . after 3 gyr from the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the mass of the gravitationally bound particles surrounding the central nucleus is about 2 @xmath10 10@xmath18 m@xmath28 as can be seen in figure 3 . by 4 gyr , further stripping decreases the mass of the gravitationally bound mass of the nucleated dwarf to the mass of the central nucleus .",
    "we speculate that this is a likely evolutionary history of the progenitor of @xmath0 cen .    in figure 4",
    "we show a snapshot of the distribution of the stripped material taken at 3 gyr .",
    "the left panel shows the distribution in the galactic plane , while the right panels shows the distribution perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "the stripped particles fill in a flattened , disk - like volume with a radius of about 10 kpc , and a vertical scale height of about 2.5 kpc .",
    "the volume density of the stripped matter in the solar neighborhood is low however .",
    "the estimated volume density of the stripped matter at @xmath29 8 kpc is about 2 @xmath10 10@xmath24 m@xmath28 pc@xmath30 .",
    "dinescu ( 2002 ) analyzed the beers _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) kinematically unbiased catalog of metal poor stars , and found an excess of rr lyrae stars in the retrograde sample when compared to the prograde sample .",
    "the metallicity range of the sample where this excess was found is [ fe / h ] = -2.0 to -1.5 , and the orbital eccentricities are larger than 0.8 ( see fig . 3 in dinescu 2002 ) .",
    "these properties are representative of @xmath0 cen and its debris characteristics .",
    "specifically , 30 rr lyrae stars were found in the retrograde sample , and 15 in the prograde one , amounting to an excess of 15 stars within a volume of 175 kpc@xmath31 .",
    "cseresnjes ( 2001 ) estimated a population of @xmath32 rr lyrae stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr ) , assuming that the galaxy lost about 50@xmath33 of its total mass . assuming also that rr lyrae stars trace the light , he estimated an integrated absolute v - magnitude of -14.7 for the whole sgr system . estimating the number of rr lyrae stars in a dwarf galaxy from the integrated absolute v - magnitude , assuming a mass - to - light ratio m / l@xmath34 of 7 ( e. g. , prada & burkert 2002 ) , and using the density of debris in the solar neighborhood estimated by our preferred model",
    ", we obtain a number of 65 rr lyrae stars in the volume of 175 kpc@xmath31 . keeping in mind that the beers ( 2000 ) catalog is not complete , the number of excess rr lyrae found by dinescu ( 2002 ) is in reasonable agreement with the expected number from @xmath0 cen progenitor s debris .",
    "we have shown that a dwarf satellite with an initial mass of @xmath1 m@xmath2 , a hernquist density profile of @xmath35 kpc , and a nucleus of @xmath36 m@xmath2 can be dragged to the current low - energy orbit of @xmath0 cen .",
    "the remnant is a central nucleus with a mass within a factor of 2 to a few of that of present - day @xmath0 cen .",
    "we suggest two refinements to the model to fully reconcile the current mass of @xmath0 cen with that of the remnant .",
    "the first one is purely computational in nature : one can explore results from higher - resolution simulations that allow a @xmath37 m@xmath2 nucleus .",
    "the second one involves a more sophisticated model : one can replace the nucleus with a collection of individual particles in order to follow the mass loss due to frequent disk passages , presumably down to the present - day mass of @xmath0 cen .",
    "in fact , leon , meylan & combes ( 2000 ) show that @xmath0 cen has tidal tails related to its last passage through the disk , and indicating mass loss .",
    "this study lends support to the hypothesis that @xmath0 cen is the core of a disrupted satellite galaxy captured from the outer halo , and it underlines that the dwarf needs specific initial conditions in order to reproduce @xmath0 cen s characteristics .",
    "our results do not exclude the scenario proposed by zhao ( 2002 ) where the satellite is captured from the edge of the galactic disk .",
    "this latter scenario however , implies ram - pressure stripping by the galactic disk , thus challenging the complex abundance pattern that @xmath0 cen possesses .",
    "the debris from the parent galaxy forms a disk - like structure within 6 kpc of the galactic center .",
    "kinematical surveys within 1 - 2 kpc of the sun should be able to detect such a structure , as a retrograde feature ( dinescu 2002 ) .",
