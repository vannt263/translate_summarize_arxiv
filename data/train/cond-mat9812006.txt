    "the denomination _ kondo lattice_@xcite applies to systems which are characterized by a lattice of localized magnetic moments coexisting with a conduction band .",
    "examples are found among cerium compounds , such as ceal@xmath0 , cecu@xmath1 , cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 , etc.,@xcite as well as some uranium or other rare - earth compounds.@xcite at high temperatures , the localized moments behave essentially as independent impurities , similarly to what happens in dilute alloys . at low temperatures , a coherent _ heavy - fermion _",
    "behavior is observed where the system resembles a fermi - liquid with enhanced values of parameters such as the specific - heat constant @xmath3 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath4 .",
    "this is a scenario found in the cerium compounds mentioned above .",
    "however , deviations from this behavior are observed : some systems can show a magnetically ordered ground state , as happens , for example , in ceal@xmath2 , ceb@xmath1 , and cepd@xmath2al@xmath0 , or become superconducting at low temperatures , as is the case of cecu@xmath2si@xmath2,@xcite cecu@xmath2ge@xmath2 at high pressures,@xcite and some uranium compounds like upt@xmath0,@xcite ube@xmath5,@xcite and uru@xmath2si@xmath2,@xcite among others . besides that , neutron - scattering experiments@xcite point to the presence of strong short - range magnetic correlations in cecu@xmath1 , ceincu@xmath2 , and ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 , for which a fermi - liquid ground state is stable , but that are probably close to the conditions for a magnetic instability .",
    "this coexistence of magnetic correlations and kondo effect was recently discussed by iglesias , lacroix , and coqblin@xcite within a mean - field approach that has points in common with a slave - boson treatment by coleman and andrei.@xcite their analysis was restricted to the case of a half - filled conduction band , which is of relevance for kondo insulators.@xcite the role played by the conduction - band filling is obviously very important for metallic compounds that show heavy - fermion behavior , and to the discussion of _ underscreened _",
    "systems.@xcite    in this paper we study the effect of band filling in the stability of the kondo state and short - range magnetic correlations in the kondo lattice using a mean - field approach closely related to the one employed in ref .  .",
    "two mean - field parameters are introduced , in connection with the local correlations generated by the kondo effect , and the non - local ones that indicate tendency towards magnetic order .",
    "these quantities behave as order parameters of thermodynamic phases where one of them or both are non - zero , while both vanish in the high - temperature `` normal '' phase . besides the order parameters themselves ,",
    "we calculate the free energy , the specific heat , and the single - particle density of states .",
    "we focus on the changes observed when one moves away from half - filling , as well as the competition between correlations induced by the kondo coupling and those produced by a heisenberg exchange term added to the original kondo - lattice model .",
    "when this interaction is strong , the system first develops magnetic correlations , and only at a lower critical temperature does the kondo effect appear , depleting but not suppressing the existing correlations .",
    "in contrast , when the heisenberg interaction is small compared to the local kondo coupling , the latter dominates , giving rise to a single phase where magnetic correlations are mostly induced by the kondo effect , and can even change sign when the band filling is low enough .",
    "the specific heat that we obtain in the metallic case shows an enhanced linear coefficient , indicating that important qualitative aspects of the physics of heavy - fermion systems are retained in the mean - field approach .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model hamiltonian and the fermionic representation of localized moments . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mean - field ] we choose the relevant fields in terms of which we rewrite the hamiltonian , perform the mean - field decoupling , find the energy eigenvalues , and introduce self - consistency equations for the mean - field parameters , as well as relations to obtain the physical quantities of interest .",
    "our results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , and a critical discussion of them appears in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the usual kondo - lattice hamiltonian is @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for the total conduction - electron spin at lattice site @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the spin operator associated to the localized moments , and the first term in the right - hand side describes the conduction band in usual notation .",
    "we choose spin-1/2 localized moments , assigning them to `` @xmath10 electrons '' .",
    "we also add a heisenberg - like interaction between nearest - neighbor localized spins .",
    "the kondo - lattice hamiltonian then reads @xmath11 the term with the factor @xmath12 is just a constant provided that we remain in the subspace of unit occupation number for the @xmath10 electrons at every site , which is the constraint that ensures the equivalence of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kondo ] ) and  ( [ eq : model ] ) if the exchange interaction is also included in the original model .",
    "the spin operators are rewritten in the usual fermionic representation @xmath13 there is no unique way of rewriting the hamiltonian in terms of fermion operators .",
    "for instance , the terms involving the @xmath14 component of the spins can be left as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spins ] ) , or the number operators can be explicitly written as products of creation and annihilation operators , whose ordering can then be altered using the fermionic anticommutation relations .",
    "the final choice of form to write down these terms will actually depend on the mean - field decoupling that will be employed , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "the first step in constructing the mean - field hamiltonian is to choose the relevant _ fields_. the original hamiltonian is naturally written in terms of _ spin fields_. however , if we just introduced a mean - field decoupling of spin products we would end up with a magnetic hamiltonian . since we intend to describe the kondo effect as well , we have to choose fields that couple @xmath15 and @xmath10 electrons at the same site , since these will tend to form local singlets .",
    "we can also couple @xmath10 electrons from neighboring sites in order to describe the short - range magnetic correlations that will develop between the localized moments . a convenient way to do",
    "this is to define the ( hermitian ) fields @xmath16 where @xmath17 labels the spin orientation ( up or down ) with respect to the @xmath14 axis , and @xmath8 and @xmath18 are nearest - neighbor sites in the definition of @xmath19 .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the contributions of transversal spin components in terms of these fields .",
    "we have @xmath20 where we have made explicit usage of the constraint @xmath21 .",
    "products involving the @xmath14 component of the spins are slightly more complicated to deal with , and sometimes these are decoupled as spin fields.@xcite however , this breaks the spin symmetry , and results in the stability of a magnetic state , with total suppression of the kondo effect , unless the local average magnetic moment is forced to be zero .",
    "hence , we will avoid this procedure , using the same kind of representation for all spin components .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations , we obtain @xmath22 due to the constraint @xmath21 at all sites , the terms containing number operators in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : szsz ] ) will yield a constant shift of the energies ( after summation over the lattice sites ) .",
    "this terms can then be dropped , leaving the kondo and heisenberg parts of the hamiltonian respectively written as @xmath23 and @xmath24    we now proceed with a standard mean - field decoupling of the operator products in these hamiltonians , introducing the mean - fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hk ] ) and  ( [ eq : hh ] ) ones sees that each field couples with a spin - independent quantity .",
    "thus , there will be no breakdown of spin symmetry , i.  e. , no magnetic states . taking this into account , together with translational invariance",
    ", we can simplify the notation , using @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we are now in a position to put all contributions together : the noninteracting terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) and the mean - field versions of the interaction hamiltonians ( [ eq : hk ] ) and  ( [ eq : hh ] ) . reverting to the fermionic representation , and adding a chemical potential @xmath29 for the conduction electrons ,",
    "we can write the complete mean - field hamiltonian @xmath30 with @xmath31 where @xmath14 represents the coordination number of a site in the lattice , and @xmath32 is the total number of sites .",
    "we will choose the conduction band to be a tight - binding band of width @xmath33 ( with nearest - neighbor hopping only ) in a ( hyper)cubic lattice in @xmath34 dimensions , so that we can write @xmath35 where @xmath29 labels the wavevector components , and @xmath36 is the lattice parameter . with this choice , the term with @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmf ] ) will have the same @xmath38-dependence as the conduction band , except for the band width .",
    "we see , thus , that the mean - field decoupling introduces a non - zero band width to the @xmath10 electrons . at this point",
    ", we have to replace the constraint @xmath21 with the much weaker constraint @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the virtual charge fluctuations introduced by the fermion representation of the localized spins have been `` put in the mass shell '' by the mean - field decoupling .",
    "of course , this real charge fluctuations are spurious , but the method relies on the expectation that the physics of the system will be reasonably preserved on the phase - space surface where the constraint @xmath39 holds . in order to improve on this point one would have to envisage better ways to take into account the constraint of single occupancy on the @xmath10 levels at each site .    leaving aside , for the moment",

    "@xmath12 plays the role of a chemical potential for the @xmath10 electrons , being fixed by the condition @xmath46 .",
    "the mean - field parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are determined through the selfconsistency equations @xmath49    we also check the self - consistency process by evaluating the free - energy , which can be written as @xmath50   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox { } + \\bar e_{\\text{k } } + \\bar e_{\\text{h } } - ( e_0 - \\mu n)n \\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the temperature ( in energy units ) .",
    "finally , we can calculate the average internal energy @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the fermi function .",
    "the last term in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : freen ] ) and  ( [ eq : energ ] ) is needed to compensate for the fact that @xmath29 and @xmath12 are already included in the hamiltonian .",
    "the specific heat can now be obtained as @xmath54 , and we can check for an enhanced linear coefficient @xmath3 , which is a signature of heavy - fermion behavior .",
    "in order to be close to real systems , we considered a three - dimensional simple - cubic lattice ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "however , given that all wave - vector dependence occurs through @xmath56 , we turn all @xmath38 sums into integrals over the conduction - band energies , for which we use a semi - elliptical density of states of the form @xmath57 here we have set @xmath58 , so that all energies are measured in units of the half band width .",
    "we choose both @xmath59 and @xmath37 to be negative , which corresponds to the usual kondo coupling , and antiferromagnetic heisenberg interactions between nearest - neighboring localized spins .",
    "the latter would be naturally interpreted as generated by a superexchange mechanism , and could also mimic the rkky interaction in the mean - field hamiltonian , although this is a debatable issue : we will see below that there exist _ induced _ spin correlations due to the kondo coupling alone , and these are more closely related to the rkky mechanism .     and @xmath48 as functions of temperature for @xmath60 ( top ) and @xmath61 ( bottom ) , in the case where the heisenberg interaction is small compared to the kondo coupling : @xmath62 , @xmath63.,width=302 ]    after numerically solving the set of self - consistency equations , we find that both @xmath47 and @xmath48 behave as typical mean - field order parameters , which vanish at high temperatures , and become non - zero through second - order phase transitions at well defined critical temperatures .",
    "we identify the region where @xmath64 with the kondo regime , and the corresponding critical temperature is interpreted as the kondo temperature ( @xmath65 ) for the lattice .",
    "we call @xmath66 the temperature below which short - range magnetic correlations appear ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "when @xmath68 , both transitions occur at the same temperature , while @xmath69 comparable to or larger than @xmath70 gives @xmath71 , as obtained earlier for the half - filled case.@xcite we show a typical example of this behavior in figs .",
    "[ fig : lgxtjhsm ] and [ fig : lgxtjhla ] , where we compare the results for a half - filled and a less - than - half - filled conduction band .",

    "@xmath62 , @xmath72.,width=321 ]    departure from the half - filled situation causes a reduction of the critical temperatures , except for @xmath66 in the large-@xmath69 regime . although the sign of @xmath48 does not have a direct physical meaning , since spin correlations are related to the square of the operator associated to @xmath48 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : szsz ] ) , we believe that the change of sign observed in fig .  [",
    "fig : lgxtjhsm ] for the case of low band filling indicates that the nearest - neighboring spin correlations have become ferromagnetic , as expected in this limit .",
    "this is only observed at low temperatures , where the kondo effect is large , and the induced part of the correlations dominate .",
    "in contrast , close to @xmath65 , @xmath47 is small , and the antiferromagnetic correlations due to the heisenberg interaction dominate . in order to check this",
    ", we would have to calculate the average @xmath73 that appears in the spin - spin correlations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : szsz ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is related to averages of products of number operators in each site , which are non - trivial in spite of the non - interacting nature of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "more specifically , these products involve number operators at displaced wavevectors , which prevents the transformation of momentum summations into energy integrals .",
    "notice , however , that when @xmath48 goes to zero , spins in different sites become decoupled in the mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "then , their correlations go to zero , which should happen when they change from antiferro- to ferromagnetic .",
    "( top ) and @xmath74 ( bottom ) for @xmath69 small , showing the complex topolgy that arises at low filling .",
    "the values of the free energy for each contour , quoted on the right , are in units of the half band width . ]    in fig .",

    "( left panel ) , the heisenberg coupling dominates , keeping @xmath48 almost unchanged , while @xmath47 is strongly reduced as we move away from @xmath60 , since we have an underscreening situation .",
    "this picture is completely changed in the small-@xmath69 regime ( right panel ) .",
    "now both parameters are reduced as one moves away from half - filling .",
    "one sees that @xmath48 is now equally sensitive to @xmath45 , which suggests that in this regime the part of the inter - site correlations _ induced _ by the conduction electrons is dominant .",
    "it eventually yields ferromagnetic spin correlations , as discussed above .",
    "we checked that a similar behavior is observed if we fix @xmath75 , when all spin correlations are induced by the conduction electrons .",
    "we have cut the curves in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lgxn ] for small @xmath45 because the convergence of our numerical calculations , which involve iterating the set of self - consistency equations for the mean - field parameters and occupation numbers , becomes very delicate in that region . in order to see what is happening , we evaluate the free energy @xmath76 [ eq .  ( [ eq : freen ] ) ] for fixed @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath45 , and @xmath51 , adjusting only @xmath29 and @xmath12 . typical contour plots of @xmath76 at low temperature as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , for half - filling and for @xmath45 very small , in the small-@xmath69 regime , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : freen ] .",
    "we can see that the minimum at finite @xmath47 and @xmath48 that exists at half - filling is displaced towards small values of @xmath47 and negative values of @xmath48 as @xmath45 is reduced .",
    "eventually , a new minimum appears for @xmath77 , since the energy eigenvalues , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigen ] ) , are symmetric with respect to the sign of @xmath48 when @xmath78 .",
    "thus , when @xmath47 approaches zero ( as @xmath45 is reduced ) we have two shallow minima separated by a very broad and low maximum at @xmath79 , which causes problems to the numerical iteration of the self - consistency equations since distant points in the @xmath47-@xmath48 space are very close in free - energy .",
    "our results for the specific heat as a function of temperature are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : spheatjhsm ] and [ fig : spheatjhla ] .",
    "the phase transitions appear in the usual `` lambda shape '' characteristic of mean - field approximations .",
    "there are two jumps in the case of large @xmath69 , at the temperatures where the kondo effect and the magnetic correlations disappear .",
    "these points coincide when @xmath69 is small .",
    "we can also see the existence of a gap at the fermi level for the half - filled band , yielding an exponentially vanishing specific heat for @xmath80 .",
    "in contrast , away from half - filling one sees a linear regime at low temperatures .",
    "the linear coefficient obtained for @xmath61 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the corresponding value in the absence of interactions .",
    "we have , thus , some enhancement of @xmath3 , although the true heavy - fermion limit ( @xmath85 ) is not reached .",
    "such an enhancement should correspond to a high density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level .",
    "we calculated the dos as @xmath86 in terms of the one - particle green s functions @xmath87 the dos depends on temperature through @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which appear in the energies @xmath88 .",
    "we plot the low - temperature dos in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] , for both @xmath60 and @xmath61 , in the small-@xmath69 regime .",
    "we can see that the fermi level ( @xmath89 falls in the gap for @xmath60 , while it is located at a point corresponding to a very high density of states away from half filling .",
    "the gap that is observed immediately above the fermi level in the latter case explains the reduction ( or at least levelling off ) of the specific heat just above the linear region in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheatjhsm ] . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the gap in the dos as well as the peaks around it are narrowed until a superposition of a free conduction band and a localized @xmath10-level is recovered above @xmath65 .    , for @xmath60 ( top ) and @xmath61 ( bottom ) , with @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the frequencies are measured in units of @xmath90 .",
    "notice that the fermi level ( vertical dashed line ) lies in the gap at half - filling , and inside a high peak for @xmath91.,width=321 ]",
    "we have presented here a detailed mean - field analysis of the kondo lattice , emphasizing the effects of conduction - band filling in the properties of the system .",
    "the regime where the kondo effect is observed , and the one in which short - range magnetic correlations are present appear as thermodynamic phases with well defined critical temperatures .",
    "these phases are characterized by non - zero values of the mean - field parameters associated to local correlations between localized and conduction electrons ( @xmath47 ) , and between localized electrons on nearest - neighboring sites ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we find a regime in which the kondo effect and short - range magnetic correlations coexist , in agrrement with experimental observations in some ce compounds.@xcite the main consequence of changing the electronic density in the conduction band with respect to half - filling is a tendency to suppress the kondo effect .",
    "magnetic correlations are equally suppressed if a direct heisenberg interaction between nearest - neighboring localized spins is weak , while they are almost insensitive to the band filling for strong heisenberg interactions . in the latter case",
    "the critical temperatures for the two order parameters are different , and one notices a partial suppression of magnetic correlations in the region where the kondo effect is observed .",
    "the phase transitions appear as lambda - shaped peaks in the specific heat , which also shows an enhanced linear coefficient in the metallic situation ( @xmath92 ) , corresponding to an enhanced density of states at the fermi level .    to a good extent ,",
    "the physics of kondo systems is recovered here , at least qualitatively , both for insulators ( @xmath60 ) and conductors ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "a weak point of this treatment is the impossibility to describe magnetically ordered states . here",
    "one would have to go back to the choice of relevant fields , trying to write down a hamiltonian in which both kondo and spin fields were present before the mean - field decoupling .",
    "it would be interesting to improve the method along these lines without loosing its formal simplicity .",
    "this simplicity constitutes the main quality of this approach , allowing evaluation of many relevant physical quantities in an unrestricted range of parameters and conditions , and yielding qualitative understanding of the behavior of the system as a whole .",
