    "the redshifts exhibited by distant sne 1a can be encompassed by the addition of a cosmological constant to the field equations of general relativity .",
    "these can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the einstein tensor ( not to be confused with newton s gravitational constant in the right member ) and @xmath2 is the matter energy - momentum tensor .",
    "@xmath3 is einstein s cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath4 can be interpreted as a constant energy density of the cosmological vacuum .",
    "it is a constant  dark energy \" density that uniformly pervades cosmological spacetime . with the adoption of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric and an appropriate value for @xmath3 , the solutions of eq . 1",
    "provide a good description of an expanding and accelerating universe .",
    "fitting the solution to the luminosity distance vs. redshift data for sne 1a yields a numerical value for @xmath3 that implies that  dark energy \" must consitute about 73% of the mass - energy density of the universe ( suzuki et al .",
    "about 23% of the remaining mass - energy must consist of  non - baryonic dark matter \" , which leaves about 4% ordinary baryonic matter .",
    "if  dark energy \" represents the ground state oscillations of all of the quantum fields within the cosmos , we might expect its value to be roughly 120 orders of magnitude larger ( carroll 2004 , sec .",
    "4.5 ) than the @xmath5 erg @xmath6 that is needed to explain the cosmological redshift observations .",
    "in addition to this rather glaring discrepancy , the energy density of matter would decrease in an expanding universe , which would allow only one coincidental moment of time in which matter and vacuum energy densities might be of comparable magnitude .",
    "thereafter the expansion of the universe must accelerate . in view of the discomfort caused by the size discrepancy and the coincidence problem , there is reason to consider a different approach to understanding the cosmological redshifts .",
    "though well established in the research literature , ( yilmaz 1971 , 1982 , 1992 , mizobuchi 1985 ) the yilmaz gravity theory is neither well known nor widely utilized , but it has passed all of the previously known observational tests and remains as a viable gravity theory . the yilmaz theory is a metric theory of gravity in a preferred set of coordinates .",
    "it differs from einstein s general relativity primarily by the role of the metric coefficients , @xmath7 .    in the einstein theory ,",
    "the metric coefficients are generalizations of the gravitational potential of newton s theory . in the yilmaz theory",
    ", @xmath7 is merely the generalization of @xmath8 , the lorentzian metric of special relativity .",
    "the gravitational potential , @xmath9 is also extended to become a tensor field , @xmath10 such that the curved spacetime metric is a function of the @xmath11 ; i.e. @xmath12 in this way , gravity is regarded as a field in its own right , and not something manifest solely by spacetime curvature . in general , @xmath13 in matter free space and also @xmath14 in general .",
    "thus there will be localized field energy in matter free space .",
    "it is this field energy that takes the place of the cosmological constant and permits an accurate accounting of the redshifts of sne 1a .",
    "it is of second degree in the derivatives of gravitational potentials and automatically of the appropriate sign and magnitude ( see appendix ) .",
    "it also contributes to spacetime curvature in a way that was forbidden by fiat in einstein s theory .    in the yilmaz theory ,",
    "the presence of free fall is indicated by a locally minkowskian metric .",
    "removal of constraining forces that prevent free fall is represented by choice of reference position for potentials .",
    "thus , unlike general relativity , free - fall is not achieved by a coordinate transformation , but rather by the choice of reference position for potential , such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 resulting in a locally minkowskian metric .",
    "particles of mass - energy are the sources of the potentials .",
    "the metric coefficients are functions of the potentials ; i.e , @xmath17 and the potentials obey generalized coordinates dalembertian equations . for a parcel of proper mass density @xmath18 and speed @xmath19 , @xmath20 and : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dalembertian operator .",
    "it is apparent that where spacetime curvature is negligible , these equations reduce to those of a special relativistic field theory .",
    "one of the central tenets of the yilmaz theory is that the speed of light in space free of matter must be isotropic .",
    "this condition can be enforced in part by adhering to the use of  harmonic coordinates \" for which @xmath23 it ensures that the phase speed of light will be the same in every direction)propagating in the space of eq .",
    "7 should satisfy a generalized dalembertian equation , @xmath24 .",
    "this will generate nonzero terms of the form @xmath25 and make the phase speed of light depend on its direction of travel unless @xmath26 .",
    "this harmonic gauge condition is assumed to hold for the metric of eq .",
    "7 and must also hold if @xmath27 were to represent a gravitational wave . ] .    in his first presentation of the theory in terms of tensor potentials , in 1971 , yilmaz stated the relation between the fields @xmath28 and the metric as a functional differential equation @xmath29 where @xmath9 is the trace of @xmath28 .",
    "it was later shown ( yilmaz 1975 , 1992 ) that this can be integrated to yield a metric form which is exact for many cases of physical interest : @xmath30})_{\\mu \\nu}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the metric of the minkowskian background , @xmath32 is the trace of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the identity matrix .",
    "the exponential function is defined in terms of its ordered taylor expansion and @xmath31 is the minkowskian metric .",
    "( in rectangular coordinates , @xmath31 is diagonal with elements ( 1 , -1 , -1 , -1 ) . )    although the equations of the yilmaz theory are decidedly nonlinear , they are very easy to use in weak field situations",
    ". one of their striking features is that gravitating masses move in potentials that obey a superposition principle and they interact via a field stress - energy tensor , @xmath35 .",
    "thus multiple body interactions are easily encompassed in the yilmaz theory ( yilmaz 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "in contrast there are no easy multiple body solutions in general relativity .    for a metric in",
    "coordinates @xmath36 one would normally need at least the potentials @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , however , for a cosmological description , we will assume that the metric has the isotropic form : @xmath39for which @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in this case , we find from eq .",
    "6 that @xmath42 is required and @xmath43 and @xmath44 the harmonic coordinate condition , eq .",
    "4 , provides two relations @xmath45 @xmath46 it is apparent from eqs .",
    "10 & 11 that we must have @xmath47 , independent of time , and @xmath48 , must be independent of @xmath49 .",
    "eq . 3 then gives the equations to be solved for these potentials as : @xmath50 and @xmath51 as eq .",
    "12 stands , it is inconsistent because @xmath52 is supposed to have no time dependence , yet @xmath53 has time dependence in the right member .",
    "this inconsistency can be removed by choosing our observation point to be located at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where the present value of mass - energy density would be @xmath56 . and requiring that @xmath57 although @xmath58 would remove the inconsistency , it would describe an inhomogeneous universe . to avoid this , we require @xmath59 .",
    "this removes the inconsistency and leaves eq .",
    "12 as @xmath60",
    "in this section we will obtain a solution of eqs .",
    "13 & 15 and a relation between redshift and luminosity distance for sne 1a for a model universe consisting of an expanding , isotropic , spherically symmetric , pressureless cosmic dust comprised of galaxy sized dust particles .",
    "we will use the metric form of eq .",
    "7 as applied by an observer located at @xmath54 at the present time , @xmath55 .",
    "there is no  universal \" time for the universe in this approach nor is there a scale factor for the entire universe .",
    "there is only the local time of an observer at the origin of coordinates . for these present conditions , @xmath61 at the observer s location and the observer s local spacetime is minkowskian .",
    "photons emitted at earlier ( negative ) times and at large distances , @xmath62 , will be detected as redshifted by @xmath63 .",
    "photons emitted at earlier times into a particular solid angle will be spread over a larger aperture as the universe expands while they are in transit . as a result",
    ", they will appear to have come from a more distant source .",
    "in conventional frw cosmology , the measured photon flux is diminished by two factors of @xmath64 .",
    "the individual photons redshift by a factor ( 1 + z ) , and the photons hit the detector less frequently , due to time dilation . in the present approach ,",
    "one of these factors is taken into account in @xmath65 .",
    "the apparent luminosity distance will be enlarged and given by @xmath66 .    for this model universe , it is assumed that motions of the dust particles are always very small compared to the speed of light .",
    "thus only @xmath67 is nonzero .",

    "taking @xmath70 , with @xmath71 a positive integration constant , satisfies eq .",
    "14 then provides for a cosmos with a matter density that decreases with time ; i.e. , an expanding universe .    defining @xmath72and converting @xmath73 to spherical coordinates , eq .",

    "mizobuchi ( 1985 ) applied the 1971 theory to a cosmological model consisting of a perfect fluid .",

    "the approach taken here was motivated by that of mizobuchi ( 1985 ) but correcting the error leads to significantly different results .",
    "a third attempt to apply the yilmaz theory to cosmology was provided by ibison ( 2006 ) .",
    "ibison assumed the correctness of the flat - space frw metric @xmath116 and found a coordinate transformation to the form of eq . 7 .",

    "the cosmological principle asserts that the universe is spatially homogenous and isotropic , but it does not demand strict adherence to the frw metric .",

    "yilmaz ( 1971 ) showed that his theory would change einstein s field equations ( eq .",
    "1 ) to the form @xmath120 where @xmath35 is a stress - energy tensor of the gravitational field .",
    "this addition of @xmath35 is about the smallest correction that one might imagine for einstein s general relativity .",
    "since @xmath35 adds only second order corrections , leaving the first order theory basically intact , it passes all of the weak - field tests that have been taken as confirmation of einstein s theory . without endorsing a particular form such as the yilmaz @xmath35 , lo ( 1995 )",
    "has shown that the inclusion of a gravitational field stress - energy term is necessary in order for einstein s field equations to correctly encompass his gravitational radiation formula .",
    "@xmath35 is generally of second order in the derivatives of the potentials @xmath121 and is small .",
    "for example , with @xmath122 in the present calculations ( see appendix ) , @xmath123 has a value of about @xmath124 at the observer s location at the origin of coordinates . of course , it has larger values at distant locations and earlier times when the matter density of the universe was larger .",
    "the replacement of a cosmological constant with @xmath35 provides a term that is of the correct order of magnitude and sign without regard to any other properties of the quantum vacuum . in this way",
    ", the yilmaz theory eliminates the need for  dark energy \" , however , the density @xmath125 , obtained here is at least an order of magnitude larger than the known baryonic mass density of the cosmos .",
    "thus a need for a considerable amount of dark matter remains in the yilmaz theory .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the solution of the yilmaz equations found here fails to conserve energy .",

    "while a few of the basic concepts of the theory have been presented here , the theory is well developed and informative discussions of various aspects of the theory have also been provided by alley ( 1995 ) , menzel ( 1976 ) , mizobuchi ( 1985 ) and yilmaz ( 1975 ) .",
    "perhaps the most well - known idea of the theory is the exponential metric for the space beyond a static , spherically symmetric mass , @xmath130 . in this case ,",

    "photons emitted at the surface would be extremely red shifted as observed distantly and very little , if any , luminosity would be observed for the object .",
    "a correct treatment of realistic compact objects of astrophysical interest will require consideration of the trapped radiation fields , especially in cases involving an active collapse process .",
    "although it is unlikely that massive point particles actually exist , @xmath138 would be zero only for @xmath54 .",
    "this should be regarded as just a classical physics point particle singularity rather than an event horizon .",
    "the kretschmann invariant is zero rather than divergent at @xmath54 .",
    "there is no curvature singularity there .",
    "the yilmaz gravitational energy expression , @xmath35 , is essentially einstein s gravitational stress - energy pseudotensor expressed in terms that eliminate pseudotensors and leave a true tensor quantity ( yilmaz 1992 , yilmaz & alley 1999 ) .",

    "this procedure eliminates them , but it is merely a mathematical artifice .",
    "no bimetric theory is intended here and there is no further need of a minkowskian metric .",

    "instead of having separate gravitational potentials , the metric coefficients of general relativity take the dual roles of potentials and descriptors of spacetime geometry .",
    "one of the problems that this presents for quantum theory is that the covariant derivatives of the metric tensor are identically zero .",
    "potentials such as @xmath52 and @xmath53 that exist separately from the metric may provide a path to a quantum theory of gravity ( yilmaz 1995 , 1997 , 1980 ) .",
    "this needs further exploration .",
    "although there have been indications of small things amiss with general relativity , such as the failure to have a complete correspondence limit with special relativity ( yilmaz 1975 , alley 1995 ) ) , they have not generally led to serious consideration of rival theories .",
