    "the study of nonlinear growth processes has recently become of central interest in physics , an example is provided by the kpz equation @xcite . originally devised to describe crystal growth , it has been since then applied to a wide range of systems , from bacterial growth @xcite to directed polymers @xcite .",
    "one of the essential features of the kpz equation is its nonlinear term introduced in order to account for lateral growth beyond the linear approximation such as described by the edwards - wilkinson model @xcite .",
    "the kpz equation is given by    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the surface position , @xmath2 is the viscosity and @xmath3 is a space and time dependent noise .",
    "there is an interesting connection between the kpz equation and the burgers equation .",
    "the latter is a nonlinear diffusion equation for the velocity field of a fluid in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "the velocity is a gradient field , @xmath5 , and its equation is written as    @xmath6    where the external stirring force is given by @xmath7 and its correlation is @xcite    @xmath8   \\exp \\left [ - \\frac{({\\bf x } - { \\bf x'})^2 } { 2n \\delta ^2 } \\right].\\ ] ]    @xmath9 is the energy injected into the fluid per unit time and unit mass and @xmath10 is the length scale at which energy is injected .    in terms of the random potential",
    "the correlation function is    @xmath11 . \\label{phi}\\ ] ]    through the hopf - cole transformation @xcite , @xmath12/z({\\bf x } , t)$ ] , the burgers equation can be put into a linear form with a multiplicative noise    @xmath13    the above equation is a schrdinger equation in the imaginary time .",
    "a similar equation for real time has been considered by several authors in a different context , such as the description of quantum open systems @xcite or the spontaneous collapse of the wave function [ csl model ] in an attempt to solve the quantum measurement problem @xcite .    in a previous article @xcite",
    ", we have presented an analogy between the csl model and enhanced diffusion .",
    "we started from a comparison of our result for @xmath14 in the beable interpretation of the csl model with similar results obtained by shlesinger _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we show that this analogy extends much further by exploring a similarity between the csl modified schrdinger equation and the kpz , burgers equations .",
    "the first section establishes an analogy between the kpz and the csl models , which provides a dictionary we use throughout the paper to move from one system to another and which allows us to introduce a reynolds number for the csl model . in section two",
    "we develop the stochastic picture underlying our beable interpretation of the csl model and connect it with the burgers equation through the velocity field .",
    "this enables us to introduce the intermittency corrections and a fokker - planck equation [ fpe ] corresponding to the stochastic equation for the csl model in the random force approximation @xcite .",
    "an analysis of this system of equations allows us to introduce a time scale characterizing the dominance of enhanced diffusion over the standard ( wiener ) diffusion .",
    "some of the results are numerically illustrated with the sample paths of our stochastic differential equation .",
    "section iii presents our conclusions .",
    "the csl model modifies the schrdinger equation by introducing a multiplicative noise in the evolution of the wave function . in one dimension ,",
    "the evolution equation in the stratonovich form for a free particle of mass @xmath15 is given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a white noise , so that @xmath18 and @xmath19 and    @xmath20\\ ] ]    characterizes the localization of the wave function .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath2 is equal to @xmath21 and @xmath22 is related to the localization scale @xmath23 and the frequency of collapse @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "these parameters are chosen in such a way that the new evolution equation does not give different results from the usual schrdinger unitary evolution for microscopic systems with few degrees of freedom , but when a macroscopic system is described there is a fast decay of the macroscopic linear superpositions which are quickly transformed into statistical mixtures @xcite .",
    "the above modified schrdinger equation is similar to eq.([z ] ) in the imaginary time . from this analogy",
    "the noise term may be written as @xmath26 , which gives the following correlation function    @xmath27.\\ ] ]    comparing this equation with eq.([phi ] ) , we identify the injection length scale @xmath10 with @xmath28 and the injected energy @xmath9 with @xmath29 and can then easily obtain the reynolds number for the csl model by using the relation @xcite : @xmath30 , which gives @xmath31 . for large reynolds number we are in the domain of fully developed turbulence , which in the csl case corresponds to a quantum system undergoing frequent collapses as @xmath24 is large .",
    "the analogy between turbulence and the csl model also provides a clarification regarding the issue of energy non - conservation in the original model for the collapse of the wave function proposed by ghirardi , rimini and weber [ grw ] @xcite .",
    "the celebrated kolmogorov analysis of 1941 [ k41 ] @xcite , identifies @xmath10 as the scale at which energy @xmath9 is injected into the system and a much smaller scale @xmath32 at which energy is dissipated . for distances",
    "@xmath33 such that @xmath34 , we have what is called the inertial regime , where energy is transferred to ever smaller length scales . the analogous result for the collapse model",
    "has that the energy is injected at the localization scale @xmath23 , which in turn is much larger than the atomic scale . in the framework of the collapse model , energy non - conservation coming from the collapse",
    "has always been discussed in terms of the magnitude of the effect itself and the constants were chosen in such a way as to make it a hardly observable effect at all . here",
    "we stress , in analogy with turbulence , that the system does not gain energy indefinitely , for the energy injected in the collapse will be dissipated at the atomic scale .",
    "the disparity of scales is such that this fact was naturally unnoticed by the proponents of the collapse model .    for completeness ,",
    "let us end this section adding that it is in the inertial regime that kolmogorov s scaling results    @xmath35    though it fails when @xmath36 is larger than 3 , a phenomenon known as intermittency , to which we shall return in the next section .",
    "we have recently analyzed the csl model from a microscopic point of view @xcite . in order to do",
    "so we used vink s treatment @xcite , which shows that two alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics that treat position as a classical concept , the causal interpretation due to bohm @xcite and the stochastic interpretation due to nelson @xcite , are actually particular cases of bell s beable interpretation @xcite .",
    "the beable interpretation is an attempt by bell to treat physical quantities that exist independently of observation and therefore can be assigned well defined values .",
    "his approach used fermion number , a discrete quantity , and vink extended it to any observable that takes discrete values on small scales .",
    "one starts from the equation for the probability density @xmath37 on a given basis    @xmath38    where the source matrix @xmath39 is given by    @xmath40    from a stochastic point of view , the probability distribution of @xmath41 values satisfies the master equation    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the transition probability for jumps from state @xmath44 to state @xmath45 .    to reconcile the quantum and stochastic views we equate ( [ disc ] ) and ( [ me ] ) :    @xmath46    with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "there is great freedom to find solutions of eq.([j ] ) .",
    "bell chooses a particular one for @xmath49 ,    @xmath50    restricting the position of a particle in one dimension to the sites of a lattice , @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 the lattice distance , it follows from the discrete version of the schrdinger equation that @xmath54 is given by    @xmath55 ' p_{n } \\delta _ { n , m-1 } - [ s ( an ) ] ' p_{n }   \\delta _ { n , m+1 } \\ } , \\ ] ]    where use was made of the polar form of the wave function @xmath56 and @xmath57 is expanded up to first order in @xmath53 . in the expression above @xmath58 ' = [ s(an+a ) -",

    "bell s choice becomes    @xmath59'}{ma } \\delta _ { n , m-1 } .\\ ] ]    this term leads to transitions only between neighboring sites .",
    "however , we could also have added to @xmath60 the solution of the homogeneous equation derived from eq.([j ] ) :    @xmath61 ^2 /2\\sigma \\right\\ } .\\ ] ]    this extra term introduces transitions between more distant sites .",
    "assuming @xmath62 sufficiently small , we can approximate @xmath63/(m - n)$ ] by @xmath64'/r(an ) $ ] and arrive at the following langevin equation for the particle position in the continuum limit    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is a free parameter , @xmath67 is a white noise , such that @xmath68 , @xmath69 and    @xmath70.\\ ] ]    eq.([nelson ] ) coincides with nelson s stochastic equation with @xmath71 .",
    "a similar equation was obtained in our analysis of the microscopic dynamics of the csl model .",
    "this is so because the new terms in the source matrix @xmath39 coming from the modified schrdinger equation ( [ csl ] ) do not contribute to the displacement @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the connection between the csl ( beable ) equation and the burgers equation is now straightforward . in imaginary time @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which , replacing @xmath75 by @xmath76 , corresponds to the hopf - cole transformation .",
    "the velocity satisfies then the burgers equation if we assume the relation between the random force and the random potential without the minus sign @xmath77 ( a point that was already noticed by garbaczewski _ et al _ @xcite ) .    to simplify the following calculations , the hamiltonian is set equal to zero as done in @xcite .",

    "\\label{dx}\\ ] ]    this equation describes the evolution of the position of a tracer in a turbulent medium .",
    "the first term on the right hand side describes a single free particle deterministic evolution and we choose @xmath84 as a short notation for the term derived from the initial wave function @xmath85 = [ \\langle x\\rangle -x][\\nu /\\delta x - \\sqrt{\\delta x \\delta p -   \\hbar ^2 /4 } /m \\delta x ] + \\langle p\\rangle /m$ ] .",
    "the two other terms describe the stochastic processes .",
    "the last term corresponds to a brownian diffusion and the second one is responsible for the @xmath86 behavior of the mean square displacement , which is the same time dependence obtained by richardson in his pioneering studies of turbulence @xcite .",
    "notice that the coefficient of @xmath14 corresponds to the injected energy @xmath87 as expected from hydro dynamical turbulence @xcite and coincides with the result in the previous section .    moreover , the time dependence and nonlocal character of the second term on the r.h.s . of the equation above are in accordance with the concept of lvy walk as introduced by shlesinger _",
    "et al _ @xcite when studying the phenomenon of enhanced diffusion .",
    "the basic difference between the more familiar lvy flight @xcite and lvy walk is that for the latter , although the walker visits all sites visited by the flight , the jumps do not occur instantaneously , but there may be a time delay before the next jump . by introducing time , shlesinger _",
    "et al _ obtained an integral transport equation involving a scaled memory which is nonlocal in space and time .",
    "contrary to the infinite mean square displacement obtained in a lvy flight , the solution of such transport equation leads to a finite mean square displacement such as the one obtained by richardson .    from eq.([dx ] ) , it follows that momentum satisfies    @xmath88 g(x - z ) .",
    "\\label{dp}\\ ] ]    the stochastic process for momentum derives from the introduction of the random potential in the modified schrdinger equation , which in turn is responsible for the localization of the wave function .",
    "this process vanishes when the grw parameters go to zero .",
    "the fpe corresponding to eq.([dx ] ) , which is a stochastic differential equation with a colored noise introduced by @xmath89 , is obtained as done by zoller _",
    "et al _ @xcite",
    ". however , as we are in the inertial regime we use the random force approximation @xcite : @xmath90 getting the following simplified equation for momentum    @xmath91    the fpe is then    @xmath92 p(x , p , t ) .",
    "\\label{fpe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a nice feature of our model is to obtain the above phase - space equation of evolution . differently from richardson @xcite",
    ", we started from purely theoretical arguments and took into account the discontinuous nature of the particle velocity .",
    "although eq.([fpe ] ) is the same one as obtained by grw @xcite , we believe it is an oversimplification of the problem and the correct fpe to be used when studying the diffusion of a tracer should come from the complete equation for momentum , eq.([fpe ] ) .",
    "this is so because the random force approximation is deemed to be incorrect @xcite , since within it there is no intermittency .",
    "however , as we show below , there is a way out of this shortcoming which allows us to obtain the intermittency corrections even in the case of the random force approximation .      having eqs .",
    "( [ dx ] ) and ( [ dp ] ) we can now proceed to obtain the mandelbrot intermittency corrections @xcite to richardson s law . in order to do",
    "so we replace a white noise in time by an affine one @xcite called fractional brownian noise    @xmath93    which gives for the anomalous diffusion term @xcite    @xmath94    this corresponds to one of the intermittency corrections obtained by shlesinger _",
    "et al _ @xcite provided we identify @xmath95 with @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 being the euclidean dimension and @xmath99 , the fractal dimension .",
    "for the momentum variable the non - white noise gives    @xmath100    which leads to the scaling relation obtained by shlesinger _",
    "@xcite for the root - mean - square velocity .",
    "we now see that , within the random force approximation , the intermittency corrections can still be obtained as eq.([ww])leads to @xmath101 .      neglecting the deterministic term in eq.([dx ] ) , we find the mean square displacement @xmath14    @xmath102    which has two contributions : the usual brownian one , coming from the @xmath103 term , and the enhanced diffusion @xcite , arising from the multiplicative noise in the modified schrdinger equation . in fig.1",
    "we illustrate , with sample paths from eq.([dx ] ) , the enhanced diffusion vis -  - vis the brownian diffusion .",
    "we see that the numerical simulation exhibits the expected behavior of enhanced diffusion    comparison of the two terms in eq.([tenh ] ) allows us to determine the time scale beyond which the enhanced diffusion dominates over the brownian one    @xmath104    using the grw parameters @xcite : @xmath105 , @xmath24(micro ) @xmath106 , @xmath24(macro ) @xmath107 , @xmath15(micro ) @xmath108 , @xmath15(macro ) @xmath109 , we estimate the time scale , which is approximately @xmath110 , independently of the macro or microscopic nature of the system .",
    "a second time scale is given by the characteristic collapse time , which is of the order of @xmath111 .",
    "it does depend on the macro / microscopic nature of the system .",
    "fig.2 displays the two time scales .",
    "the dashed line indicates the schrdinger evolution , by which we mean the evolution of the wave function undisturbed by the collapse term . for the microscopic system",
    "enhanced diffusion manifests itself even before collapse occurs , opening an interesting window for experimental tests of this scenario , which would help to put stricter bounds on the parameters of the grw / csl models @xcite .",
    "in this article we found further points of contact between turbulence and the csl model , identifying the csl counterparts of important quantities in turbulence , such as the reynolds number and the injected energy .",
    "finally a study of the different time scales governing enhanced and brownian diffusion indicates that there is a region of parameter space of the csl model amenable to experimental test , an investigation we plan to follow in a forthcoming publication .",
