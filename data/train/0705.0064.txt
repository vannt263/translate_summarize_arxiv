    "this has been employed successfully to obtain the critical interaction strength for attractive condensates under 3d trapping @xcite .",

    "this forms three wavepackets with no atom transfer between them ( figure  [ fig7](c ) ) .",
    "this dynamical method of generating solitons is loosely analogous to the experimental generation of solitons .",
    "however , whereas the alternating phases arise naturally in the experiment , we must introduce them numerically .",
    "when the phase imprinting is terminated , and providing the critical number @xmath137 is not exceeded , the solitons oscillate axially and repeatedly collide ( figure  [ fig7](c ) ) , as observed experimentally .",
    "the alternating phase structure prevents overlap and suppresses the collapse instability .",
    "however , the solitonic interaction excite collective modes in the solitons .",
    "when @xmath12 exceeds a critical value , the system is unstable to collapse and the solitons are destroyed .",
    "this critical value depends on the lengthscale @xmath138 , and so to obtain @xmath137 we must vary @xmath138 to obtain the most stable configuration .",
    "we find that the most stable configurations arise when @xmath139 . in order to generate a @xmath140 state we perform a similar process by imposing three @xmath0-phase steps at @xmath128 and @xmath141 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig7](b ) . under stable parameters ,",

    "a similar trend was predicted in the quasi-1d approach of michinel _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "an important question is how many solitons are favoured to exist for a given number of atoms @xmath12 .",
    "the addition of a soliton involves adding a @xmath0-phase slip to the system , which is energetically costly .",
    "we can therefore expect that the most energetically - favourable number of solitons will be the minimum number of solitons / phase slips that can support @xmath12 atoms without being unstable to collapse .",

    "all three data sets diverge away from the ratio @xmath152 as @xmath123 increases .",
    "the divergence is greatest for low scattering lengths , which is related to the fact that these wavepackets are widest ( since the soliton size is characterised by @xmath154 ) and therefore interact most with their neighbours .",
    "the region above the points represents configurations of the system which are completely unstable to collapse .",
    "the region below the lines in figure  [ fig8](a ) also represents stable configurations of the system , but these configurations consist of a higher number of solitons / phase slips , and therefore correspond to higher energy .     versus the most stable number of solitons @xmath123 ( up to @xmath140 ) for scattering lengths @xmath155 nm ( red pluses / dashed line ) ,",

    "note that both @xmath123 and @xmath12 were averaged over many observations , and generally feature an error representing the spread in their observations .",
    "although this data shows the same trend as our numerical data in figure  [ fig8](a ) ( for fixed @xmath3 ) , it should be note here that each point corresponds to a different scattering length . we have therefore plotted the corresponding numerical results in figure  [ fig8](b ) .",
    "however , it is important to note the following : the number of atoms measured experimentally in the system @xmath160 will typically include non - condensed atoms , whereas in our analysis @xmath12 describes the total number of atoms in the bec .",
    "in other words , these experimental and theoretical parameters are not necessarily equal .",
    "initially we assume that all the experimentally observed atoms are in the bec , i.e. @xmath161 ( black circles in figure  [ fig8](b ) ) .",
    "the numerical data is similar to the experimental data with most numerical points lying within the spread of the experimental observations .",
    "however for two data points the numerical data over - estimates @xmath123 , e.g. where the experiment observes close to one and two solitons we predict two and three solitons , respectively .",
    "however , assuming that @xmath162 of the atoms observed experimentally represent non - condensed atoms , i.e. @xmath163 ( red crosses in figure  [ fig8](b ) ) , we find that these two anomalous points are corrected and every numerical point is consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "this is a conservative estimate for the number of non - condensed atoms given the ` hot ' state of the condensate in the experiment .",
    "note that if there was zero phase difference between the solitons they would overlap upon collision , and the critical number would then be @xmath126 for @xmath164 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the solutions of an attractively - interacting bose - einstein condensate in the mean - field limit using the full gross - pitaevskii equation and variational techniques .",
    "radial confinement is assumed throughout , and in the axial direction we consider the absence of trapping and the presence of confining or expulsive harmonic potentials . in particular",
    "we evaluate the critical interaction parameter @xmath14 for condensate collapse across the whole range of axial geometries using the full gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we note that the variational method is not particularly sensitive to whether the sech - based or gaussian - based ansatz is used , even in the limits of zero and strong axial trapping .",
    "we find that the variational method gives good qualitative agreement with the full gross - pitaevskii equation , but that significant quantitative differences can exist , particularly in the important critical points for collapse and expansion .    in the absence of axial trapping , bright solitary wave solutions exist , which are self - trapped in the axial direction by the attractive interactions . according to the full solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation , we find that bright solitary wave solutions are stable to collapse only when the interaction parameter @xmath165 .",
    "analysis of the energy ` landscapes ' reveals a finite excitation energy to excite the bright solitary wave to non - solitonic states , characterised by either collapse or dispersion of the wavepacket . unless the interaction parameter is close to the collapse condition , i.e. @xmath166 , the bsw will tend to decay by dispersion .",
    "the excitation energy of a bright solitary wave is proportional to the radial trap frequency , and for sufficiently weak radial trapping , the excitation energy can be less than the typical thermal energy , indicating thermodynamic instability of such states .    in the presence of either a confining or expulsive axial potential , @xmath14 becomes dependent on the trap geometry . for the confining potential , we regain the results of gammal _ et al . _ @xcite and good agreement with the experimental measurement of @xmath14 @xcite . under an expulsive axial trap ,",
    "there is also a _ lower _",
    "critical interaction strength @xmath111 below which the trap leads to expansion of the wavepacket .",
    "therefore @xmath14 and @xmath111 define the upper and lower boundaries of a range of solutions .",
    "however , when the trap ratio @xmath2 exceeds a critical value @xmath167 ( based on the full gross - pitaevskii equation ) , no solutions exist for any interaction strength . whereas for expulsive potentials and no confinement the main decay channel is dispersion , with axial confinement the only decay mechanism is collapse .",
    "note that , for a weak expulsive potential , one can tune the system such that the energy barrier for collapse and dispersion are equal .    finally , based on the jila experiment @xcite we have generated dynamical states of multiple ` solitons ' with alternating phase .",
    "we have mapped out the critical numbers for these states and find good agreement with the quantitative experimental data , confirming the important role of @xmath0-phase differences in systems of multiple solitons .",
