    "in the case of the @xmath0-meson form factor @xmath249 ( that is given by the overlap of the @xmath9-wave functions ) , we found a two - resonance dominance pattern , when just two lowest bound states in the @xmath18-channel contribute .    analyzing the large-@xmath18 behavior of the @xmath248 form factor ( given by exact @xmath0-pole vmd ) , we established that its asymptotic normalization in the soft - wall model is much lower ( by factor 2.566 ) than that of the hard - wall model .",
    "this difference is explained by essentially lower value of the soft - wall model @xmath92 wave function at the origin .",
