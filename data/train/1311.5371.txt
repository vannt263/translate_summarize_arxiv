    "one can draw the following conclusions : comparing with the exact ci results , the results from the improved sum rule formulas are more accurate than the tdhf results .",
    "the improved accuracy of the sum rules can be explained by the fact that the static hf calculations could be performed with a larger basis than the time - dependent hf calculations .",

    "nevertheless , the plot is suitable to trace the finite size effects , with the frequency minima for @xmath137 , as well as monotonic behavior of large systems .",
    "as the frequencies approach the ideal limit only very slowly , we conclude with a remark that one can give a numerical proof for the large-@xmath0 behavior in the tf approximation . for that purpose ,",
    "one uses the ideal density to calculate the kinetic energy , the trap energy and the interaction energy ( with arbitrary fixed @xmath56 ) as a function of the particle number .",
    "such a calculation reveals that , for each coupling parameter @xmath56 , there exists a large particle number for which the interaction energy becomes negligible compared to the other two contributions .",

    "<S> we investigate the quantum breathing mode ( monopole oscillation ) of trapped fermionic particles with coulomb and dipole interaction in one and two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this collective oscillation has been shown to reveal detailed information on the many - particle state of interacting trapped systems and is thus a sensitive diagnostics for a variety of finite systems , including cold atomic and molecular gases in traps and optical lattics , electrons in metal clusters and in quantum confined semiconductor structures or nanoplasmas . </S>",
    "<S> an improved sum rule formalism allows us to accurately determine the breathing frequencies from the ground state of the system , avoiding complicated time - dependent simulations . in combination with the hartree - fock and the thomas - fermi approximations this enables us to extend the calculations to large particle numbers @xmath0 on the order of several million . tracing the breathing frequency to large @xmath0 as a function of the coupling parameter of the system reveals a surprising difference of the asymptotic behavior of one - dimensional and two - dimensional harmonically trapped coulomb systems .    </S>",
    "<S> trapped systems are of major interest in many fields of research . </S>",
    "<S> prominent examples are correlated electrons in metal clusters , e.g. @xcite , confined plasmas @xcite , ultracold quantum gases in traps or optical lattices @xcite , electrons in quantum dots @xcite ( `` artificial atoms '' ) , excitons in bilayers and quantum wells , e.g. @xcite trapped ions @xcite , and colloidal particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these systems may differ in many physical details , their theoretical descriptions are often similar . </S>",
    "<S> a key property of finite systems in traps are the low - lying collective oscillations since they serve as a valuable diagnostic tool for the investigation of time - dependent and static features , e.g. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of these collective modes is comparable to that of spectroscopy in atomic systems . on the other hand , from the theoretical point of view , </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of normal modes is interesting as the results can be used to check the quality of models and of nonequilibrium simulations . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we concentrate on the breathing mode  the ( uniform ) radial expansion and contraction of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this collective mode can easily be excited in experiments , e.g. by modulation of the confinement frequency or by a rapid compression or expansion @xcite .    for classical systems , </S>",
    "<S> the breathing mode is well understood @xcite . however , </S>",
    "<S> if one incorporates quantum effects , the description of the mode becomes more complex . in our recent works </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we reported results from time - dependent simulations and presented some unique properties of the quantum breathing mode . among others , we discovered that the breathing mode comprises a superposition of at least two oscillations , which is a pure quantum effect . while one of the corresponding frequencies , @xmath1 , has a universal value that equals twice the trap frequency , the other one , @xmath2 , is strongly dependent on various system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the present work is to determine how the frequency @xmath2 is influenced by , e.g. , the particle number , the coupling parameter of the system , the dimension of the system and the type of binary interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these results are crucial for exploiting the above mentioned diagnostic potential of the breathing mode . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis for bosons with contact interaction in a one - dimensional trap that is complementary to ours is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the numerical results in our previous works are based on time - dependent approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the high numerical effort of these simulations poses strong restrictions on the accessibility of several physical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the particle number usually does not exceed the values @xmath3 in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems @xcite and @xmath4 in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems @xcite . to overcome this problem , </S>",
    "<S> a simple semi - analytical estimator for the breathing frequency has been presented in our recent work  @xcite . as this estimator </S>",
    "<S> is solely based on equilibrium quantities , it enables one to save the computational effort of the time propagation in computer simulations , and , additionally , to use the breathing frequency as an experimental tool to determine the kinetic , trap and interaction energies of trapped systems . in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we validated the accuracy of the estimator , comparing its predictions with the results from correlated time - dependent calculations . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we make use of it to describe physical situations for which no time - dependent calculations are available . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically study one- and two - dimensional systems of charged fermionic particles in the range from small finite systems to gases with many particles . </S>",
    "<S> such a joint analysis of the dimensionality and the particle number has not been performed so far . to work out how the equilibrium approach is connected to existing theories for the collective motions of many - body systems </S>",
    "<S> , we further extend the theoretical foundations of the breathing mode , providing a systematic description in terms of time - dependent perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to conclude that the breathing mode is characterized by the spectrum of the initial hamiltonian . to avoid an exact diagonalization of this hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , we follow the well - known sum rule formalism @xcite to extract an approximation for the lowest excitation energy from the ground state . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , we show how to improve the sum rule formulas , which turns out to be important , especially for small systems . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rules allow us to apply ground - state methods with strongly reduced computational costs . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we are able to considerably extend our previous results for fermionic particles with coulomb interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are performed in the framework of the hartree - fock approximation , for small weakly coupled systems with significant finite - size effects , and the thomas - fermi approximation , for the transition to large systems . </S>",
    "<S> one of the major results from our analysis is that the dimension of the system has a strong influence on the qualitative behavior of large systems : with growing particle number , a one - dimensional system behaves more like an ideal quantum system ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , while a two - dimensional system , by contrast , approaches the classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this unexpected behavior is indicated by the lowest frequency of the breathing oscillation as well as a localization parameter which relates the average extension of the system to that of an ideal quantum system . discussing how the total energies scale in non - interacting and </S>",
    "<S> strongly coupled ( classical ) systems , we further provide an explanation for the behavior in terms of simple quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> we start our presentation with a brief review of the quantum mechanical description of the trapped system . expressing the excitation of collective modes in terms of time - dependent perturbation theory , we lay the foundation for the application of the sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly recapitulate the most important sum rule formulas and show how their accuracy can be improved . using this formalism , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze how the breathing frequency depends on the particle number , the coupling parameter and the dimensionality of the system . </S>"
