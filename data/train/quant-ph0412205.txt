    "the emergence of classical behavior from a quantum system is a problem of interest in many branches of physics @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the quantum to classical transition involves two necessary and related conditions : _ correlations _ , i.e. the wigner function of a quantum system should have a peak at the classical trajectories ; and _ decoherence _ , that is , there should be no interference between classical trajectories . to study quantitatively the emergence of classicality , it is essential to consider the interaction of the system with its environment , since both , the loss of quantum coherence and the onset of classical correlations , depend strongly on this interaction @xcite . using this point of view , classicality is an emergent property of an open quantum system .",
    "the strength of the coupling between system and environment sets the decoherence time which , roughly speaking , indicates the timescale after which the system can be considered classical @xcite .",
    "the very notion of quantum open system implies the appearance of dissipation and decoherence as an ubiquitous phenomena and plays important roles in different branches of physics ( from quantum field theory , many body and molecular physics to theory of quantum information ) , biology and chemistry .",
    "oftentimes , a large system can be described adequately as a composite system , consisting of two or a few subsystems ( degrees of freedom ) interacting with their environment ( thermal bath ) comprising a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "examples include electron transfer in solution , large biological molecules , vibrational relaxation of molecules in solution , excitons in semiconductors coupled to acoustic or optical phonon modes .",
    "quantum processes in condensed phases are usually studied by focusing on a small subset of degrees of freedom and treating the rest as a bath .",
    "decoherence is the main ingredient in order to find classicality .",
    "the interaction between the system and the environment induces a preferred basis which is stable against this interaction , and becomes a classical basis in the hilbert space of the coupled system .",
    "preferred pointer states are resilient to the entangling interaction with the bath .",
    "this `` einselection '' ( environment induced superselection ) of the preferred set of resilient pointer states is the essence of the environment .",
    "it is accepted that a rapid loss of coherence caused by the coupling with the environment is at the root of the non - observation of quantum superpositions of macroscopically different quantun states @xcite .",
    "a relevant property of the pointer states is their insensitivity to being monitored by the interaction with environment ( and , therefore , are resistant to the entanglement caused by the environment ) .",
    "the less the states entangle , the more stable they are .",
    "all other states evolve into joint system - environment states , preserving their purity .",
    "our concern in this letter is to analyze the effect of the zero point fluctuations of the environment , as a source of decoherence .",
    "the coupling of a quantum system to an environment generally leads to energy fluctuations in the test particle even at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "since phases are time integrals of energy , zero point energy fluctuations make possible that decoherence occurs even at zero temperature .",
    "these fluctuations are a consequence of the finite coupling energy between the test particle ( system ) and the bath , and of the fact that the halmiltonian of the isolated system does not commute with the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "vacuum fluctuations have several observable effects .",
    "the lamb shift is a widely known example .",
    "another one is the casimir effect . in these examples",
    "the effect of vacuum can be thought in terms of the renormalization of the original parameters characterizing the system .",
    "in contrast , the fluctuations we deal with in this letter are not only absorbed into renormalized parameters of the test particle .",
    "not only does the environment renormalize , but also it is a source of dissipation and noise for the system .",
    "therefore , we are considering the effect of quantum fluctuations of the environment over a quantum system , as the only source of decoherence ( meaning that there is no possible thermal fluctuations inducing classicality ) .",
    "the question about the influence of zero temperature environment on the interference phenomena has been discussed in the last years @xcite .",
    "there have been studies on the temperature dependent weak localization measurements @xcite , reporting residual decoherence in metals at zero temperature , in contradiction to theoretical predictions @xcite , and on the zero - point decoherence induced by coulomb interactions in disordered electron systems ; just to mention a few examples .    in previous works",
    "( see for example @xcite for an excellent review of the _ state of the art _ of decoherence ) about decoherence in quantum brownian motion , most of the conclusions are simply numerical or analytical only in the high temperature limit @xcite .",
    "low temperature case was discussed in @xcite showing a numerical estimation of the decoherence rate .",
    "s. sinha , in ref .",
    "@xcite , studied the zero temperature case analytically . under some approximations",
    "the author found an expression for the time dependence of the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix . in this letter",
    ", we complete that study showing an exact calculation of diffusive terms , and also providing the decoherence timescale for different situations of interest .",
    "in addition , we solve the master equation for an upside - down brownian particle to emphasize the role of zero temperature fluctuations during a second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "let us consider a quantum particle ( characterized by its mass @xmath0 and its bare frequency @xmath1 ) linearly coupled to an environment composed of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators ( of mass @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 ) .",
    "we may write the total action corresponding to the system - environment model as ( we set @xmath4 ) @xmath5 & = & s[x ] + s[q_n ] + s_{\\rm int}[x , q_n]\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int_0^t ds \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } m ( { \\dot x}^2 - \\omega^2 x^2 ) + \\sum_n \\frac{1}{2 } m_n ( { \\dot q}_n^2 - \\omega_n^2 q_n^2)\\right ] - \\sum_n c_n x q_n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the coordinates of the particle and the oscillators , respectively .",
    "the particle is coupled linearly to each oscillator with strength @xmath8 .    the relevant objects to analyze the quantum to classical transition in this model are the reduced density matrix ( obtained from the full density matrix integrating out all the degrees of freedom of the environment noted as @xmath9 ) , and the associated wigner function @xmath10 the reduced density matrix satisfies a master equation .",
    "hu - paz - zhang @xcite have evaluated the master equation for the quantum brownian motion problem ( alternatively , one can write an equation of the fokker - planck type for the reduced wigner function @xcite in order to study the dynamics in phase space )    @xmath11 - i\\gamma(t)\\bigl[x,\\bigl\\ { p,\\rho_{\\rm r}\\bigr\\}\\bigr ] -d(t)\\bigl[x,\\bigl [ x,\\rho_{\\rm r}\\bigr]\\bigr ]   -f(t)\\bigl[x,\\bigl [ p,\\rho_{\\rm r}\\bigr]\\bigr ] .",

    "@xmath15 is the dissipation coefficient related to the friction kernel defined below , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the diffusion coefficients , which produce the decoherence effects .",
    "diffusion coefficients come from the noise kernel , source of stochastic forces in the associated langevin equation .",
    "@xmath17 is named anomalous in the literature since it generates a second derivative term in the phase space representation of the evolution equation , just like the ordinary diffusion term @xcite . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the dissipation and noise kernels , respectively , @xmath20 @xmath21 is the spectral density of the environment , defined as @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the physical high - frequency cutoff , which represents the highest frequency present in the environmet ) . in the high temperature limit of an ohmic environment ( where @xmath24 ) the coefficients in eq.([coef ] ) become constants .",
    "in particular , the diffusion coefficient can be approximated by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dissipation coefficient @xcite . in this limit , while @xmath26 is a constant and @xmath27 , the coefficient @xmath28 can be neglected . therefore , the term proportional to @xmath29 is the relevant one in the master equation at high temperatures in order to evaluate decoherence",
    ".    we will evaluate the time dependent coefficients of the master equation at zero temperature .",
    "for this , we set @xmath30 .",
    "these coefficients have been evaluated previously in refs.@xcite .",

    "the expression can be very well approximated , when @xmath34 , by    @xmath44    this coefficient is the normal diffusion at @xmath45 .",
    "this is for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in time scales longer than the memory time @xmath46 .",
    "this coefficient is an oscillatory function of time .",
    "in fact , only in the limit @xmath47 , as @xmath48 goes to @xmath49 , we can have an asymptotic value @xmath50 , independent of time @xcite ( fig . 1 ( e ) ) .",
    "in any other case , the coefficient has an initial transient and approaches the asymptotic value @xmath51 as the @xmath48 ( see fig . 1 ( c ) ) .",
    "it is important to note , that in the opposite case , when @xmath52 , normal diffusion is a linearly growing function of time , @xmath53 , similar to the result obtained in ref.@xcite .",

    "on top we show frequency renormalization ( a ) and dissipation coefficients ( b ) .",
    "plots below show the normal @xmath29 ( c ) and anomalous @xmath60 ( d ) diffusion coefficients for short times in order to show the initial transient .",
    "asymptotic values of diffusion are shown in ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "the parameters used in the plot are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63.,width=377 ]    in fig . 1",
    ", we show the time behavior of these coefficients .",
    "it is easy to probe asymptotic behavior also from analytical expressions .",
    "it has been noted that the master equation in the high temperature limit ( or even in the @xmath64 constant approximation ) has the pathology that the density matrix loses its positivity at short times ( shorter than @xmath65 ) .",
    "this violation is essentially due to the action of the friction term .",
    "master equation ( [ master ] ) does not have the pathological behaviour of the master equation at high temperature @xcite .",
    "the dissipation coefficient is a time - dependent function that vanishes initially together with its first derivative .",
    "therefore , the initial behaviour of the density matrix is diffusion dominated and positivity is preserved , even in the perturbative case , up to second order with respect to the coupling constant between system and environment .    with these coefficients at hand , we will evaluate the decoherence time following refs.@xcite .",
    "we will analyze the decoherence process in a simple case .",
    "we prepare an initial superposition of delocalized ( in position or momentum ) states .",
    "we consider two wave packets symmetrically located in phase space , of the form @xcite : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 @xmath68^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is normalization , and @xmath70 is the initial width of the wave packet . in terms of the wigner function ,",
    "the state at time @xmath71 is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74    all the coefficients are functions of time , determined by the evolution propagator of the reduced density matrix and the initial state .",
    "the explicit form can be found in ref .",
    "the initial state is such that @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 indicate the evolution of the fringes in the momentum and coordinates directions of the phase space .    as it was defined in the previous literature",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , the effect of decoherence is produced by an exponential factor @xmath80 , defined as    @xmath81^{\\frac{1}{2}}}.\\ ] ]    initially , @xmath82 , and it is always bounded @xmath83 .",
    "the fringe visibility factor @xmath84 evolves in time as @xmath85 . in the high temperature approximation ,",
    "the anomalous coefficient is neglected and we obtain the very well known decoherence rate considering only the constant diffusion term , proportional to @xmath86 . in our present case , at zero temperature , both coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath60 contribute to the fringe visibility factor .",
    "a conservative choice is to assume fringes always stay more or less frozen at the initial values , and we can set @xmath87 and @xmath88 . neglecting the initial transient ( i.e. @xmath34 ) , we use eqs.([dlarge ] ) and ( [ flarge ] ) to evaluate @xmath84 . in order to have the simplest analytical expression for the decoherence rate , we use a short time approximation to evaluate @xmath89 , giving @xmath90 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we get    @xmath91    in order to evaluate the decoherence time @xmath92 , we have to solve @xmath93 . from eq.([aint ] ) it is not possible to find a global decoherence time - scale at @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , we can find limits in which we are able to give different scales for decoherence .",
    "for example , for large natural frequency @xmath1 , such as @xmath95 ( @xmath47 ) , it is easy to see that    @xmath96    giving a very short decoherence time - scale ,    @xmath97    this result will be valid as long as the product @xmath98 , in order to be able to neglect the initial transient .",
    "it coincides with the decoherence time evaluated directly from @xmath51 as in ref.@xcite . in this limit",
    ", the anomalous coefficient does not play any role ( as we could check using @xmath99 in ( [ td1 ] ) ) .    in the opposite limit ,",
    "when @xmath52 ( for times @xmath100 ) , we can approximate @xmath84 using asymptotic limit of @xmath48 and @xmath101 by    @xmath102   , \\label{a2}\\ ] ]    resulting in a decoherence time bound , @xmath103 , which could be large for very underdamped systems . here , the logarithmic correction is due to the @xmath17 diffusion term ( unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , where anomalous diffusion was neglected ) .",
    "this scale is longer than the decoherence time in the high temperature , even in the case of low temperature for high natural frequency of the brownian particle .",
    "our result is still smaller than the saturation time @xmath104 , the time in which @xmath84 reaches its maximum value .    in the case",
    "we can neglect the second term in ( [ a2 ] ) [ for example considering `` macroscopic '' trajectories ( large @xmath105 ) ] , we can show    @xmath106    summarizing , in this section we have shown analytical expressions for the decoherence rate at zero temperature .",
    "we were able to extract the decoherence timescales in different cases , giving new results respect to previous works @xcite and showing how to get known numerical results .",
    "in this section we are concerned with the analysis of the quantum to classical transition of the order parameter during a second order phase transition @xcite . in a realistic model",
    "one should address this problem in the context of quantum field theory@xcite .",
    "this is a very difficult task since non gaussian and non perturbative effects are relevant . for this reason , we will only concentrate here in a toy model in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "guth and pi @xcite considered an upside down harmonic oscillator as a toy model to describe the quantum behavior of this unstable system .",
    "this toy model should be a good approximation for the early time evolution of the phase transition , as long as one can neglect the non - linearities of the potential @xcite . in this section",
