    "much has been accomplished in previous years to shrink the feature size of nanomagnets in view of increasing the storage density of magnetic random access memories ( mram ) and hard disk drives , but also to develop materials exhibiting a magnetic anisotropy strong enough to resist thermal fluctuations at small dimensions , while remaining switchable by accessible magnetic fields @xcite . in the ubiquitous soft alloy ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 ( permalloy , py ) ,",
    "the magnetic anisotropy can , in certain cases , be tailored by the geometry of the nanostructure . for instance , appropriately sized py ellipses have two stable states , where the magnetization lies along the longer in - plane dimension of the element .",
    "another type of anisotropy exists in this material that remains to be harnessed to technological applications : configurational anisotropy ( ca ) @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is a direct effect of the rotational symmetry order ( @xmath2 ) of a nanostruture on its magnetic anisotropy : triangles ( @xmath2=3 ) evidence a six - fold anisotropy , squares ( @xmath2=4 ) a four - fold anisotropy , and pentagons ( @xmath2=5 ) a ten - fold anisotropy@xcite .",
    "note that the necessity for easy and hard axes to present the same symmetry leads to frequency doubling for odd orders of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "configurational anisotropy relies on the fact that at small dimensions , a uniform magnetization can not be sustained anymore in non - ellipsoidal structures , leading to a sizable deformation of the spin arrangement into an energetically more favorable state , balancing exchange and demagnetization energy costs .",
    "this effect could for instance allow the coding of multiple `` bits '' per nanostructure , or be used for complex toggling or switching mechanisms in mram type structures .    to be of interest however , it is necessary to have an excellent control of this anisotropy .",
    "different approaches have been proposed to measure higher - order magnetic anisotropies , such as rotating field magneto - optic kerr effect ( rotmoke ) @xcite in magnetic thin films , or modulated field magneto - optical anisometry ( mfma ) @xcite in supermalloy ( ni@xmath0fe@xmath3mo@xmath4 ) and fe nanostructures presenting ca . in both methods , large static fields are used to impose macrospin - like behavior in the structure , in order to interpret the data within a stoner - wohlfarth ( sw ) model and extract a value for the strength of this anisotropy . here",
    "we present an alternative reliable and straight - forward experimental technique to obtain the six - fold anisotropy field of submicron triangles , and we use micromagnetic simulations to define a criterion estimating the maximum triangle dimensions up to which this parameter can indeed be defined .",
    "equilateral py triangles were fabricated on silicon by a 20kv electron beam lithography , followed by thermal evaporation and a lift - off process .",
    "a typical scanning electron micrograph of these triangles was presented in ref .",
    "their widths and thicknesses varied between @xmath5=150 - 300  nm , and @xmath6=6 - 26  nm , and they were spaced by @xmath5 into large @xmath7 arrays . in these nanostructures , configurational anisotropy is responsible for two possible magnetization states : a buckle state where the global magnetization lies parallel to the edge , and the spins buckle from one corner to the other ; or the y - state , where @xmath8 follows a triangle bisector , the spins splaying in ( or out ) from two corners toward the third @xcite .",
    "we have shown recently that for triangle dimensions above 100  nm wide/10  nm thick , only the buckle state can be stabilized @xcite , such that the @xmath9 [ modulus @xmath10 directions are easy axes , and the @xmath11 [ @xmath10 directions hard axes .",
    "while nanostructures exhibiting ca can not , by definition , exhibit a macrospin behavior in the strict sense , it is tempting to compare their reversal to a stoner - wohlfarth ( sw ) model @xcite , where the global magnetization is defined as @xmath12 , and the pseudo macrospin anisotropy is described by the simple energy functional @xmath13 , with @xmath14 defined with respect to the base of the triangle and @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is positive , giving the buckles to be easy axes as is the case in our samples . to compute a sw switching astroid , a zeeman term",
    "was then added to this expression and the total energy @xmath17 studied as a function of the applied field @xmath18 , with @xmath19 once again defined with respect to the base of the triangle .",
    "the astroid is constructed as follows , taking the example where the field @xmath20 is ramped along the hard axis @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ sw]c ) . starting from the @xmath22 energy functional @xmath23 ,",
    "a positive field is ramped up to @xmath24 for which a first transition is observed ( @xmath25 to @xmath26 ) upon a local sign inversion of @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitude of this transition is @xmath26 . with increasing field",
    ", the @xmath28 to @xmath26 transition occurs at @xmath29 ( amplitude of @xmath25 ) and finally @xmath26 to @xmath9 occurs at @xmath30 ( once again a @xmath26 transition ) . for a field",
    "applied exactly along @xmath11 , the @xmath9 and @xmath26 positions are strictly speaking degenerate and the transition field then diverges ; this actually leads to a computational artifact creating a slight asymmetry along the @xmath11 [ modulus @xmath10 directions .",
    "the @xmath26 transition shown in fig .",
    "[ sw]c ( field @xmath30 ) will however be possible as soon as the field is brought away from the bisector . applying the field in the opposite direction ( @xmath11 + @xmath28 ) gives transitions of equal amplitude at identical fields .",
    "for the field applied within @xmath31 of the easy axes @xmath9 [ @xmath10 , an initial @xmath26 transition is followed at much higher field by a full @xmath28 transition .",
    "note that there are two different types of @xmath26 transitions : the `` lower - field '' ones with maxima along @xmath9 [ @xmath10 , and the `` higher - field ones '' , with maxima along @xmath11 [ @xmath10 .",

    "[ sw]a presents equal maxima along the easy and hard axes .",
    "the envelope of the full astroid is therefore a twelve - pointed star .",
    "the sole effect of increasing the anisotropy field is to expand the astroid , keeping all features identical , as shown in fig . [",

    "following these calculations , a possibility to extract a value of @xmath16 from experimental data would be to use an experimental switching astroid . the latter has been measured @xcite , but this method tends to yield fairly large error bars on the transition fields , as it requires to isolate specific transitions as small kinks in the hysteresis loops .",
    "another solution consists of _ forcing _ @xmath26 rotations of the magnetization in the triangles , for instance by using a large rotating field . by measuring the field amplitude required to observe a magnetization flip from one buckle to the next",

    "a triangle in a @xmath9 buckle , a rotating field of 324  oe will therefore induce a rotation toward the @xmath26 buckle just as it crosses the @xmath65 direction .",
    "faraday effects and other perturbations tend to introduce an arbitrary slope to the loops , which we have subtracted for clarity ; the amplitude of the transitions are therefore not directly comparable with the simulations .      for each array ,",
    "@xmath66 loops were measured under increasing values of @xmath42 , starting from the lowest one giving a 6-stepped loop .",
    "the data was then represented as a polar plot representing the rotating field amplitude as a function of the transition angles @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ polar ] ) . note that both @xmath49 and @xmath38 transitions are represented .",
    "they were obtained by applying the field counterclockwise or clockwise .",
    "the experimental @xmath68 data evidences the same characteristics as the computed higher - field @xmath26 transitions either side of @xmath21 [ @xmath10 in the sw astroid .",
    "mainly , if the magnetization lies along the bottom edge of the triangle ( @xmath9 buckle ) , it can only flip by @xmath69 to the following buckle under the torque of a field applied along @xmath70 at the least .",
    "when this angle is increased , the field required to obtain a transition strongly decreases , and ceases to be measurable at about @xmath71 .",
    "this is naturally reminiscent of the magnetization reversal mechanism in ellipses , where the additional torque from an @xmath54 field perpendicular to @xmath53 greatly reduces the switching field .",
    "we then attempted to fit the experimental @xmath68 data to the higher - field @xmath26 transitions calculated in the sw astroid ( fig .",

    "6-steps hysteresis loops were easily obtained under a rotating field , and a @xmath68 polar plot of @xmath26 transitions readily extracted . before retrieving @xmath77 values from these data however ,",
    "the validity limits of this method needs to be questioned .",
    "indeed , while the 6-stepped hysteresis loops seem to warrant a macrospin - like behavior , and therefore legitimize the approach described above , it can be argued that the existence of a @xmath26 transition is not a good criteria for a macrospin behavior in our nanostrutures , being an easy , small amplitude sliding of spins from one buckle to the next . a full @xmath28 reversal , or any procedure allowing the magnetization to relax would be a more reliable control test .",
    "the experimental switching astroid now becomes a useful tool , as it is measured by applying a saturating field along a direction @xmath78 , letting @xmath8 relax while reversing the field direction , and observing the configurational changes of the spins leading to a full reversal of the magnetization along @xmath79 .",

    ", a simple remanence loop along the @xmath9 direction of the triangle should evidence the passage by a vortex state , seen as the presence or absence of a second step in the loop , and determine whether it is legitimate to extract an @xmath77 value from the data obtained under a rotating field .",

    "above this value ( thickness 18  nm , width 150  nm , full line in fig .",
    "[ loops ] ) , a double step transition evidences the formation of a vortex , and therefore the boundary of applicability of our sw - based analysis of the six - fold anisotropy field .",
    "the cut - off dimension between macrospin and non - macrospin - like behaviors are therefore quite similar between simulations and experiments in the explored size range : 15 nm thick , 200  nm wide for the first , 18  nm thick , 150  nm for the second .",
    "it may be argued that the zero - temperature nature of these computations lets the system enter shallow energy wells , such as the vortex configuration , whereas thermal fluctuations in the experiment leave them unnoticed . within the explored dimensions ,",
    "the volume of the nanostructure at the boundary can however be considered identical between simulations and experiment .",
    "following this measurement , six - fold anisotropy fields were extracted from the moke data for triangles @xmath5=150 - 300  nm and @xmath6=6 - 15  nm , as summarized in table [ tab : h6 ] . @xmath77",

    ", the values agree well with the anisotropy fields obtained in thinner triangles using mfma @xcite ; the thinnest sample presented in the present study for instance ( 6  nm thick , 300  nm wide ) has an anisotropy field of @xmath85 , very comparable to the 107  oe obtained by mfma in 5  nm thick , 270  nm wide triangles .",
    "the method presented here however , gives an estimation of the limit of a macrospin description of configurational anisotropy . finally ,",
    "these anisotropy fields are comparable to experimental uniaxial anisotropy fields @xmath86 obtained in permalloy ellipses @xcite , with the major difference that they are obtained in non - elongated structures via configurational anisotropy .       in elliptical or rectangular platelets",

    "increasing @xmath6 creates more charges at the structure edges , and decreasing the width ( keeping @xmath89 constant ) brings these poles closer together , both leading to a larger @xmath88 @xcite . a monotonous increase of @xmath86 as a function of @xmath90",
    "is then expected .",
    "this is in part what is observed in the triangles : at fixed triangle width , the anisotropy field increases with @xmath6 ( table [ tab : h6 ] ) . at fixed triangle thickness however ,",
    "@xmath77 first increases when the width decreases , and peaks at around 200  nm before decreasing .",
    "interestingly , this latter trend with width is not observed for anisotropy fields extracted from zero - temperature micromagnetic simulations ( fig .",
    "[ rot ] ) following the procedure described in section [ sec : results ] : the @xmath77 fields are in this case found to increase monotonously with increasing thickness and decreasing structure size . for the smaller structures ( @xmath91 9  nm thick , 150 nm  wide ) the anisotropy energy @xmath92 deduced from the experimental anisotropy fields",
    "amounts to about 10@xmath93 ( volume @xmath94 of the triangle , symmetry order @xmath2 of the structure @xcite ) .",
    "thermal fluctuations then become sufficient to overcome the anisotropy barrier , and @xmath77 starts to decrease as the structure is brought closer to the superparamagnetic regime .",
    "note that configurational anisotropy is weak enough to let us observe the ferromagnetism - superparamagnetism transition at larger dimensions than in permalloy ellipses @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have devised a simple experimental method to extract the six - fold anisotropy fields of permalloy triangles presenting configurational anisotropy . using a large rotating field to impose a particular @xmath26 transition , we created conditions to compare our data to a stoner - wohlfarth model .",
    "moreover , using micromagnetic simulations , we proposed a straightforward test to assess the validity of this approach for triangles of any given dimensions . finally , we highlighted the specificity of configurational anisotropy in which the usual thickness over width dependence of the anisotropy field is not fully observed due to the proximity of the superparamagnetic regime .",
    "equipped with this fundamental parameter characterizing the magnetic anisotropy , further work will focus on assessing the stray field interaction between these structures , in order to compare them to typical values of nanomagnets currently used in data storage technologies ."
