    "quantification of correlations in bipartite quantum systems is one of the important problems in quantum information .",
    "quantum correlations can be considered as the resources for quantum information processes @xcite .",
    "initially , it was assumed that entanglement which plays an important role in quantum computing and quantum information processing , is the only kind of nonclassical correlation in a quantum state .",
    "this issue has been widely studied in the last decade and various entanglement measures have been introduced to measure entanglement such as entanglement of formation , entanglement of cost , relative entropy entanglement , and negativity .",
    "indeed , entanglement is not the only responsible correlation for the quantum bypassing classical regimes and there exists some quantum correlations other than entanglement which result in the quantum effects in quantum information processes .",
    "for instance , bennett _ et al .",
    "_ showed the possibility of quantum nonlocality without entanglement @xcite .",
    "also , it is shown that separable states can be used for quantum speedup @xcite . in order to quantify the quantumness of correlations in bipartite states ,",
    "it has been proposed several measures such as quantum discord @xcite , quantum deficit @xcite , quantumness of correlations @xcite , and quantum dissonance @xcite .    in particular , quantum discord which historically is the first introduced measure for the nonclassicality based on the openheim - horodecki paradigm ,",
    "has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "it is based on the difference between two quantum extensions of classically equivalent concepts namely the mutual information .",
    "although quantum discord has a simple definition , its explicit evaluation is hard to perform in practice especially for multi - qubit states and is often only given by numerical methods .",
    "however , some analytical expression of quantum discord for two - qubit states are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is known that since some separable states still have quantum correlations , these correlations with quantum nature are more general than entanglement . in particular , luo @xcite introduced a quantum - classical classification based on measurement - induced disturbance ( mid ) to characterize statistical correlations in bipartite states . in this scenario ,",
    "classical states are classified in terms of nondisturbance under quantum measurement .",
    "however , quantum systems and thus quantum correlations are disturbed under generic measurements and the magnitude of the disturbance can be considered as a measure to characterize the quantumness of states .",
    "recently , girolami _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the quantum discord due to its asymmetric definition does not properly determine the distinction between classical - classical and classical - quantum states and thus it is not strongly faithful .",
    "also , by characterizing quantum correlations in the paradigmatic instance of two - qubit states , they observed that mid overstimates quantum correlations so that for some classical states we obtain nonzero correlation .",
    "they therefore proposed an ameliorated measurement - induced disturbance ( amid ) as a quantifier of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to characterize and quantify the quantum correlation for bipartite systems which are initially prepared in three - qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) @xcite @xmath1 states under various noisy channels where the first two qubits belong to party @xmath2 and the third qubit belongs to party @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that this class of w states can be used for perfect teleportation , superdense coding , and as an entanglement resource @xcite .",
    "this state belongs to the category of w states @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a real number , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are phases , and reduces to @xmath8 for @xmath9 and zero phases .",
    "then , the initial states are affected by noisy channels which results in decreasing of the quantumness of states .",
    "we quantify the quantum correlations for the initial ghz and w states in the presence of noise and investigate the robustness of these states under different kinds of noise .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we characterize quantum correlations using mid and amid approaches . secs .",
    "[ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] are devoted to determine quantum correlations for the ghz and w states , respectively .",

    "consider a bipartite state @xmath10 for a system with two parties @xmath2 and @xmath3 . based on measurement - induced disturbance ,",
    "the quantum correlations of @xmath10 , that is denoted by @xmath11 , is given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is quantum mutual information that quantifies the total correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath14 in which @xmath15 and @xmath16 are complete projective measurements for parties @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",

    "note that if @xmath21 , we conclude @xmath10 is not perturbed with respect to local measurement @xmath22 , therefore @xmath10 is a classical state . otherwise , it is a quantum state and possesses quantum correlation . for our case , since party @xmath2 has two qubits , it is convenient to write eq .",

    "the time evolution of multi - qubit ghz states in the presence of noise is studied analytically in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we study analytically the evolution of ghz state under various noisy channels and obtain corresponding quantum correlations using the measurement - induced disturbance approach .",
    "also , we numerically obtain quantum correlations using amid which does not suffer from overestimating quantum correlations of mid approach .",

    "<S> we study quantum correlation of greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w states under various noisy channels using measurement - induced disturbance approach and its optimized version . </S>",
    "<S> although these inequivalent maximal entangled states represent the same quantum correlation in the absence of noise , it is shown that the w state is more robust than the ghz state through most noisy channels . also , </S>",
    "<S> using measurement - induced disturbance measure , we obtain the analytical relations for the time evolution of quantum correlations in terms of the noisy parameter @xmath0 and remove its overestimating quantum correlations upon implementing the ameliorated measurement - induced disturbance . </S>"
