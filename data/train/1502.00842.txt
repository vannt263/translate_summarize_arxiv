    "distributed storage systems ( dss ) are becoming increasingly important due to the explosively grown demand for large - scale data storage , including large files and video sharing , social networks , and back - up systems . distributed storage systems store a tremendous amount of data using a massive collection of distributed storage nodes and , to ensure reliability against node failures , introduce a certain of redundancy .    the simplest form of redundancy is replication .",
    "dss with replication are very easy to implement , but extremely inefficient in storage efficiency , incurring tremendous waste in devices and equipment . in recent years , some efficient schemes for distributed storage systems , such as erasure codes @xcite and regenerating codes @xcite , are proposed .",
    "we focus on erasure codes in this paper .",
    "mds codes are the most efficient erasure codes in term of storage efficiency .",
    "when use an @xmath11 $ ] mds code , the data file that need to be stored is divided into @xmath1 information packets , where each packet is a symbol of the coding field .",
    "these @xmath1 information packets are encoded into @xmath12 packets and stored in @xmath12 storage nodes such that each node stores one packet . then the original file can be recovered from any @xmath1 out of the @xmath12 coded packets .",
    "although mds code is storage optimal , it is not efficient for node repair .",
    "that is , when one storage node fails , we must download the whole file from some other @xmath1 nodes to reconstruct the coded packet stored in it .    to construct erasure codes with more repair efficiency than mds codes , the concepts of locality and locally repairable code ( lrc )",
    "were introduced @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the @xmath15th code symbol @xmath16 in an @xmath11 $ ] linear code @xmath17 is said to have locality @xmath18 if there exists a subset @xmath19=\\{1,2,\\cdots , n\\}$ ] containing @xmath15 and of size @xmath20 such that the punctured subcode of @xmath17 to @xmath21 has minimum distance at least @xmath22 .",
    "we will call each subset @xmath23 a _ repair group_. thus , if @xmath24 has locality @xmath18 , then @xmath24 can be computed from any @xmath25 other symbols in the repair group @xmath23 .",
    "a code is said to have all - symbol locality @xmath18 ( or is called an @xmath26 code ) if all of its code symbols have locality @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath27 .",
    "the code has a higher repair efficiency than mds code if @xmath28 . the minimum distance of an @xmath26 linear code is bounded by ( see @xcite ) : @xmath29 however , for the case that @xmath30 and @xmath31 , there exists no @xmath26 linear code achieving the above bound @xcite .",
    "the most common case of @xmath26 linear code is that @xmath12 is divisible by @xmath32 . for this case , in the constructions presented in the literature , all code symbols of an @xmath26 linear code are usually divided into @xmath33 mutually disjoint repair groups such that each repair group is a codeword of an @xmath34 $ ] mds code .",
    "[ fg - ex - code1 ] illustrates a @xmath35 systematic linear code with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the information symbols and @xmath39 are the parities .",

    "each group is a codeword of a @xmath40 $ ] mds code .",
    ", height=92 ]    as pointed out in @xcite , in distributed storage applications there are subsets of the data that are accessed more often than the remaining contents ( they are termed `` hot data '' ) .",
    "thus , a desired property of a distributed storage system is that the subsets of hot data can be retrieved easily and by multiple ways .",
    "for example , for the storage system illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fg - ex - code1 ] , suppose @xmath42 is hot data",
    ". there are two `` easy ways '' to retrieve it from the system : downloaded @xmath42 directly from the node where it is stored , or decode it from any four coded symbols in the first group .",
    "another way is to decode it from some six coded symbols , but this is not an easy way because to decode @xmath42 , one has to decode the whole data file .",
    "-group decodable code : @xmath38 are information symbols and @xmath43 are parities .",
    "each codeword has @xmath44 buckets and each bucket is a codeword of a @xmath40 $ ] mds code that is encoded from @xmath45 information symbols .",
    "clearly , each bucket is a repair group.,height=92 ]    in this work , we introduce a new family of erasure codes , called _ group decodable code ( gdc ) _ , for distributed storage system , which can provide more options of easy ways to retrieve each information symbol than systematic codes . given a set of design parameters @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of information symbols , each codeword of an @xmath2-group decodable code is a @xmath3-tuple of strings , called _ buckets _ , such that each bucket is a string of @xmath4 symbols that is a codeword of a @xmath5 $ ] mds code ( which is encoded from @xmath6 information symbols ) .",
    "so such codes have the following two properties :    * _ locally repairable _ : each code symbol has locality @xmath7 . *",
    "_ group decodable _ : from each bucket we can decode @xmath6 information symbols .",
    "[ fg - ex - code2 ] illustrates a @xmath46-group decodable code .",
    "there are six information symbols @xmath38 .",

    "clearly , each bucket is a repair group .",
    "so each code symbol of this code has locality @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , this code provides more options of easy ways to retrieve each information symbol than the code in fig .",
    "[ fg - ex - code1 ] .",
    "for example , @xmath42 can be downloaded directly from two nodes or can be decoded from any four symbols in bucket 1 or any four symbols in bucket 2 . in the case",
    "that @xmath42 is requested simultaneously by many users of the system , the can ensure that multiple read requests can be satisfied concurrently and with no delays .",
    "we establish an upper bound of the minimum distance of group decodable code for any given set of parameters @xmath0 ( theorem [ up - bnd ] ) .",
    "we also prove that there exist linear codes of which the minimum distances achieve the bound , which proves the tightness of the bound ( theorem [ up - bnd - tight ] ) .",
    "our proof gives a method to construct @xmath2-group decodable code on a field of size @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the length of the code .",
    "some existing works consider erasure codes for distributed storage that can provide multiple alternatives for repairing information symbols or all code symbols with locality .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced the metric `` local repair tolerance '' to measure the maximum number of erasures that do not compromise local repair .",
    "they also presented a class of locally repairable codes , named pg - blrc codes , with high local repair tolerance and low repair locality .",
    "however , they did not present any bound on the minimum distance of such codes .    in @xcite ,",
    "the concept of @xmath50-locality was defined , which captures the property that there exist @xmath51 pairwise disjoint local repair sets for a code symbol .",
    "an upper bound on the minimum distance for @xmath11 $ ] linear codes with information @xmath50-locality was derived , and codes that attain this bound was constructed for the length @xmath52 . however , for @xmath53 , it is not known whether there exist codes attaining this bound .",
    "upper bounds on the rate and minimum distance of codes with all - symbol @xmath50-locality was proved in @xcite .",
    "however , no explicit construction of codes that achieve this bound was presented .",
    "it is still an open question whether the distance bound in @xcite is achievable .",
    "another subclass of lrc is codes with @xmath54-locality : any set of @xmath3 code symbols are functions of at most @xmath55 other code symbols @xcite .",
    "hence , for such codes , any @xmath3 failed code symbols can be repaired by contacting at most @xmath55 other code symbols .",
