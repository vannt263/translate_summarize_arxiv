    "the accurate measurements of processes involving neutral mesons oscillations like @xmath2,@xmath3 and @xmath7 have become a great laboratory to check standard model ( sm ) consistency as well as new physics models feasibilities .",
    "it is well known that mesons oscillations are forbidden at tree level in the sm , but may be generated by taking into account loop corrections or introducing dimension-6 operators  @xcite .",
    "experimental precision data up to now are completely consistent with sm predictions regarding mesons oscillations , thus several analysis have been performed in order to test and constrain new models . in the case of 331 models",
    "@xcite , fcnc arise naturally at tree level in the quark sector because the new neutral gauge boson @xmath1 predicted by the model couples differently with the third family , leading to non - universal interactions . up to",
    "now it has been thought that this gauge boson was the unique source of fcnc at tree level in the 331 model . here",
    ", we are going to show that there are two other sources induced by cp - even and -odd scalars instead . in this work will be adopting a 4 texture zeros for the quark mass matrices in the calculation of mass difference terms for the neutral mesons systems @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , hence different conclusions may arise in more general approaches . in order to explain these novel contributions we are going to put them in perspective , firstly summarizing the key features of the model , and then describing how the scalars interact with the sm quarks .",
    "our framework is the @xmath0 model  @xcite , based in the gauge group @xmath8 , a direct extension of the electroweak sector of the sm .",
    "this model features many of the sm virtues while elegantly providing interesting explanations for dark matter signals  @xcite and for many theoretical questions , such as number of families  @xcite among others @xcite . since our goal is to unveil the sources of fcnc we will leave out detailed discussions about the model and give a prompt and sufficient description of it in order to allow the reader to follow our reasoning . for those who are seeking a complete description of the model",
    "we recommend the reviews  @xcite .      likewise",
    "the sm , the leptonic sector is arranged with left - handed fields appearing in triplets , @xmath9 , and right - handed ones in singlets , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents the three generations . in the hadronic sector , the first two families are placed as anti - triplets @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , while the third one is placed as triplet , @xmath14 . the first two and the third family of quarks are in different representations due to an anomaly cancellation requirement adequately described in previous works @xcite . as a consequence of this non - universality in the quark sector , sources of fcnc will arise at tree level in the @xmath0 model as we will show later . similarly to the sm , these fermions acquire mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism in the scalar sector presented hereafter .",
    "the scalar sector is composed of three scalar triplets namely ,    @xmath15    these scalars allow us to build the scalar potential ,    @xmath16    which is responsible for the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism @xmath17 and @xmath18 as described in  @xcite .",
    "after the diagonalization procedure we find a cp - even @xmath19 and a cp - odd @xmath20 basis as follows ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the vev of the neutral scalars @xmath26 and @xmath27 while @xmath28 is the vev of the neutral field @xmath29 . here",

    "@xmath31 stands for the standard higgs boson , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two heavy cp - even scalars . in eq . @xmath34 and @xmath35 fields are goldstone bosons while @xmath36 is a heavy massive pseudoscalar .",
    "in particular the scalars @xmath33 and @xmath36 are responsible for the fcnc in the scalar sector of the 331 model as we will demonstrate in the next sections .",
    "the other scalars of the model such as the charged ones , are not important in our analyses .",
    "the triplet of scalars given in the eq.([conteudoescalar ] ) , will be responsible for generating all fermions masses , except for neutrinos , through the yukawa lagrangian : @xmath37    mass terms for neutrinos are obtained either by dimension five effective operators @xcite or by adding a scalar sextet  @xcite or a scalar anti - triplet  @xcite . since the neutrinos masses are completely irrelevant to our discussions we are going to skip to the gauge sector .      in the gauge sector",
    "the model recovers the standard gauge bosons and adds five more , known as @xmath38 ; the first four carry two units of lepton number and thus are called bileptons . as we can see in eq.([massvec ] ) their masses are roughly determined by the scale of symmetry breaking of the model , the value of @xmath28 .",
    "in particular the new neutral gauge bosons @xmath1 is under novel lhc experiments results regarding dilepton ressonance searches at @xmath39 tev  @xcite . assuming that @xmath1 and z share the same couplings to fermions",
    ", these experiments have imposed a strong constraint on @xmath1 mass , @xmath40 tev with 95% c.l .",
    "cms searches for a heavy gauge boson @xmath41 @xcite , have put competitive bounds on the spectrum of the model .",
    "the latter provides equivalent constraints on parameter space of the model .",
    "we will take @xmath1 for simplicity , with no impact on our conclusions .",
    "however we highlight that in the @xmath0 the couplings to fermions involving @xmath1 are lower than the ones involving the z , as can be checked in eq .. how precisely this experimental constraint affects our model is completely out of the scope of this work .",
    "notwithstanding , we are going to be conservative and adopt this lower mass limit throughout our analysis .",

    "the next sections will be devoted to explaining how the fcnc emerge in the @xmath0 model , and to quantify them according to recent data .",
    "as aforementioned fcnc is suppressed in the sm at tree level but reveals itself naturally in the @xmath0 model . in the most general case , the neutral gauge bosons of the model namely , @xmath43 and @xmath44 mix and provide the neutral currents derived in appendix [ appendix1 ] .",

    "expanding these fields around their @xmath78s we find @xmath79    substituting eq . into eq .",

    "this scenario would lead to mixing among the @xmath94 and the @xmath95 and consequently to changes in the w bosons couplings with standard model particles which are largely disfavored by the precise measurements regarding the @xmath94 properties and couplings@xcite .    with these matrices we can find the yukawa lagrangian eq . in terms of the physical scalar bases given determined in eq.([hdfisicos1])-([hufisicos3 ] ) in the appendix([appendix ] ) . through these",
