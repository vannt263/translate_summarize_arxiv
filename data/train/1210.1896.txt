    "therefore the acceleration can be associated either with non - stationary electric fields ( electromagnetic waves ) or with time - varying magnetic fields . in the latter case",
    "the work can be done by the induced electric field @xmath5 the basic idea of acceleration by electromagnetic inhomogeneities in astrophysical conditions was suggested by @xcite who assumed that the galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) were accelerated by collisions of charged particles with fluctuations of magnetic fields ( magnetic clouds ) moving chaotically with the velocity dispersion @xmath6 .",
    "one of the features of this theory was that it yielded naturally a power - law spectrum of accelerated particles .",
    "the rate of particle acceleration by this stochastic mechanism is about @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the particle kinetic energy and velocity , and @xmath10 is the average time of particle collision with the clouds .",
    "this rate of acceleration is slow because @xmath11 . in kinetic equations ,",

    "one of the several interpretations of the hxr excess from the coma cluster in the range 20 - 80 kev was an assumption that it was produced by bremsstrahlung radiation of suprathermal electrons ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , this model was criticized by @xcite who concluded from simple estimates that in this case the intracluster plasma in coma had to be overheated very fast .",
    "the point is that suprathermal electrons emitting the hxr excess lose their energy mainly by coulomb losses , i.e. , they lose their energy by heating the background plasma . if these electrons generate an x - ray flux @xmath19 by bremsstrahlung , they transfer the energy flux @xmath20 to the background plasma .",

    "this seems to make plasma overheating inevitable .",
    "however , we should point out that in effect particle acceleration may also be accompanied by plasma cooling due to run - away flux of high energy particles from thermal pool , and more careful analysis is necessary to define which of these effects ( plasma heating or cooling ) prevails .",
    "this analysis is presented in the following sections .",
    "a natural source for suprathermal particles is stochastic acceleration of seed particles from a background plasma .",
    "these particles are accelerated when the rate of acceleration @xmath25 exceeds the rate of the coulomb losses @xmath22 .",
    "a characteristic energy called the injection energy @xmath26 is the energy above which a non - thermal spectrum is formed by acceleration .",
    "it is determined by equating these rates of acceleration and loss .",
    "the kinetic equation in the particle momentum space describing stochastic particle acceleration from background plasma has the form ( assume isotropic distribution ) @xmath27=0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the diffusion coefficient of stochastic ( fermi ) acceleration , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 describe particle momentum losses and diffusion due to coulomb collisions .",
    "these coefficients are calculated from the total distribution function @xmath30 ( see appendix  [ appendix - kin ] ) , and therefore in general the equation is nonlinear .",
    "an analytical solution of this equation for the case of weak acceleration from a background plasma with temperature @xmath31 was obtained by @xcite .",
    "the term of stochastic acceleration was taken in the phenomenological form @xmath32 the analysis was provided for the case when the characteristic time of stochastic acceleration , @xmath33 is much larger than the time of thermal particle collisions , @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the density and @xmath31 is the temperature of background plasma , @xmath37 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath38 is the electron rest mass and @xmath39 is the mass of accelerated particles .    in this case",
    "the injection energy @xmath26 is much larger than the plasma temperature , @xmath40 .",
    "coulomb collisions keep the equilibrium maxwellian distribution for most part of the momentum range , and the coefficients of eq .",

    "this excess at @xmath44 is formed by coulomb collisions in the transition range between the thermal ( maxwellian ) and non - thermal parts of the spectrum .",
    "if the hxr excess is due to bremsstrahlung emission of electrons from this transition region then the relation  ( [ c_en ] ) used by @xcite can not be applied to the estimate of @xmath20 and more accurate calculations are necessary .",
    "bremsstrahlung emission of electrons from the transition region was calculated in @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that the necessary energy input @xmath20 for coma was about one order of magnitude less than obtained by @xcite .",
    "this may solve the problem of the plasma overheating .",
    "however , their linear analysis of equation  ( [ e_k ] ) does not include variations of temperature @xmath31 which is supposed to be constant .",
    "more reliable conclusions can be derived from analyses of the nonlinear equation in the form similar to those used by @xcite , when a feedback of accelerated particles on the plasma temperature is taken into account .",
    "very recently @xcite and @xcite provided similar numerical analysis for the case of stochastic acceleration from a background plasma .    the nonlinear kinetic equation describing particle coulomb collisions is derived in @xcite ( see appendix [ appendix - kin ] ) .",
    "using this theory @xcite derived coefficients of this equation for the case of isotropic and homogeneous distribution function for non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "later , @xcite extended their analysis to the general case of anisotropic distribution function .",
    "numerical analysis of these equations has been performed by @xcite for the isotropic stochastic acceleration in the form @xmath62 @xcite stated that the continuous stochastic acceleration of thermal electrons produced a nonthermal tail .",
    "but for the hard x - ray emission in the coma cluster this model actually can not work because the energy gained by the particles is distributed to the whole plasma on a timescale much shorter than that of the acceleration process itself . moreover , bremsstrahlung is relatively inefficient to cool the accelerated electrons , the energy of this tail is quickly dumped into the thermal background plasma and heat the plasma .",
    "similarly , @xcite obtained numerical solutions of the nonlinear isotropic kinetic equations which included effects of plasma heating for the stochastic diffusion in the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the kinetic energy normalized to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are free parameters .",
    "@xcite concluded that their calculations confirmed qualitatively results of @xcite that the required input energy @xmath20 was lower than that follows from the estimate ( [ c_en ] ) but by a factor of 2 or 3 only , and that did not solve the problem of plasma overheating .",
    "besides , they argued that their calculations confirmed results of @xcite that stochastic acceleration could not work in clusters because the energy gained by the particles was distributed to the whole plasma on timescales much shorter than that of the acceleration process . at acceleration rates smaller than the thermalization rate of the background plasma , there is very little acceleration .",
    "the primary effect of acceleration is heating of the plasma . in the opposite case , at higher energizing rates ,",
    "a distinguishable nonthermal tail is developed , but this is again accompanied by an unacceptably high rate of heating .",
    "in other words it follows from these investigations that it is problematic to accelerate particles from a background plasma because the main effect of this acceleration is plasma overheating .",
    "the energy supplied by external sources in the form of stochastic ( fermi ) acceleration is quickly absorbed by a background plasma .",
    "an interesting question arises : whether any conditions exist when the stochastic acceleration generate prominent nonthermal tails while the plasma is not overheated and its temperature varies relatively slowly . from the analysis in the following sections",
    ", we argue that the answer is affirmative .",
    "first , we estimate variations of plasma temperature derived in quasi - stationary approximations when the distribution function can be presented as @xmath70 . in this case , @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are slowly varying functions of @xmath17 .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate the isotropic form of the kinetic equation  ( [ equp ] ) .",
    "this equation describes stochastic particle acceleration from background plasma and it is exactly the same as eq .",

    "the appropriate boundary conditions are eqs .",

    "the particle kinetic energy @xmath64 is also normalized to @xmath65 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath76 , @xmath29 and @xmath13 are normalized accordingly .",
    "the stochastic fermi acceleration is supposed to be isotropic and has a phenomenological form as @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are arbitrary parameters .",
