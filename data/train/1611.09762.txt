    "this paper is concerned with two closely related topics in planar fractal geometry : the furstenberg set problem , and exceptional sets of orthogonal projections .",
    "i start with the central definition :    [ furstenbergsets ] let @xmath0 .",
    "a set @xmath1 is a furstenberg @xmath2-set , if there exists a set of unit vectors @xmath19 with positive length such that the following holds : for every @xmath20 , some line @xmath4 parallel to @xmath5 satisfies @xmath21 \\geq s$ ] . here",
    "@xmath22 is hausdorff dimension .",
    "the terminology was introduced in 1999 by t. wolff @xcite , who proved the following lower bound for the hausdorff dimension of furstenberg sets :    the hausdorff dimension of compact furstenberg @xmath2-sets is at least @xmath23 .",
    "wolff suspected that his bound is not sharp , and made the following conjecture :    [ furstenbergconjecture ] the hausdorff dimension of compact furstenberg @xmath2-sets is at least @xmath24 .",
    "where does the name `` furstenberg set '' come from ? in 1970 , h. furstenberg @xcite proved the following theorem .",
    "assume that @xmath25 are integers such that @xmath26 is irrational .",
    "assume that @xmath27 $ ] are closed sets invariant under @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath0 , and assume that some line @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31 \\geq s$ ] . then @xmath32 is a furstenberg @xmath2-set .",
    "furstenberg was interested in the problem : how do lines intersect product sets of the form @xmath32 ?",
    "he conjectured that @xmath33 \\leq \\max\\{0,{\\dim_{\\mathrm{h}}}(a_{p } \\times a_{q } ) - 1\\}\\ ] ] for every line @xmath30 .",
    "keeping in mind furstenberg s theorem cited above , the upper bound would evidently follow , if only one could prove the lower bound @xmath34 for all furstenberg @xmath2-sets .",
    "however , the estimate @xmath34 is too optimistic in general : as shown by wolff @xcite , conjecture [ furstenbergconjecture ] is the strongest possible for general furstenberg sets . in other words ,",
    "the sets in definition [ furstenbergsets ] are too general to help solve furstenberg s conjecture for the special sets of the form @xmath32 .",
    "fortunately , the services of general furstenberg sets are no longer required for this purpose : only this year , furstenberg s conjecture was spectacularly verified ( independently ) by p. shmerkin @xcite and m. wu @xcite , with two very different techniques !    for general sets , progress in conjecture [ furstenbergconjecture ] has been quite modest . around the year 2000 , katz and tao @xcite observed that improving wolff s bound for furstenberg @xmath35-sets is roughly equivalent to proving a `` @xmath36-discretised '' sum - product theorem in @xmath37 .",
    "the latter task was then accomplished in 2003 by bourgain @xcite .",
    "hence , the combined efforts of katz - tao and bourgain give the following improvement to wolff s bound :    there is an absolute constant @xmath12 such that the hausdorff dimension of compact furstenberg @xmath35-sets is at least @xmath38 .",
    "of course , the theorem also gives an improvement for furstenberg @xmath2-sets with @xmath2 very close to @xmath35 , but , to the best of my knowledge , wolff s bound remains the world record for other values of @xmath39 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to prove a bourgain - katz - tao type @xmath13-improvement to wolff s bound for all values @xmath40 . as a notable caveat",
    ", the method only works for packing dimension :    [ mainfurstenberg ] for @xmath40 , there exists a constant @xmath41 such that every furstenberg @xmath2-set @xmath11 has packing dimension @xmath15 .",
    "the foremost reason , why the proof of theorem [ mainfurstenberg ] does not give information about hausdorff dimension  or even lower minkowski dimension  is that it relies on the counter assumption @xmath42 , which gives information about @xmath11 on two different scales , namely @xmath36 and @xmath43 .",
    "assuming @xmath44 does not have similar consequences . for a reader familiar with kakeya sets ,",
    "i mention that a similar issue seems to stand in the way of improving wolff s bound @xmath45 for the hausdorff dimension of kakeya sets in @xmath46 : the improved lower bound @xmath47 from 2000 by katz , aba and tao @xcite is only known for upper minkowski dimension .",
    "finally , i mention that several papers have been written around wolff s conjecture [ furstenbergconjecture ] in the past few years .",
    "an article of zhang @xcite completely solves a discrete variant of the conjecture , plus its analogues in higher dimensions .",
    "zhang also studied a variant of the problem in finite fields @xcite .",
    "most recently , ellenberg and erman @xcite used machinery from algebraic geometry to study a `` @xmath48-plane '' variant of wolff s conjecture in finite fields .      the second topic of the paper are orthogonal projections .",
    "this is one of the most classical  and popular  topics in fractal geometry , so the amount of literature is immense : for a reader interested in finding out ( much ) more than covered below , i suggest taking a look at the recent survey of fraser , falconer and jin @xcite .",
    "fix @xmath0 , and let @xmath1 be a borel set of hausdorff dimension @xmath49 . in 1968 , kaufman @xcite proved , improving an earlier result of marstrand @xcite from 1954 , that @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the orthogonal projection @xmath52 . under the assumption @xmath49 , kaufman s bound is sharp : in 1975 , kaufman and mattila @xcite constructed explicit compact sets @xmath1 with @xmath53 such that @xmath54 under the assumption @xmath55 , the sharpness of is an open problem .",
    "the following improvement is conjectured ( in ( 1.8 ) of @xcite , for instance ) :    [ mainc ] assume that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath58    it is well - known that there is a connection between the case @xmath59 of conjecture [ mainc ] and wolff s conjecture [ furstenbergconjecture ] for furstenberg sets . as observed in 2012 by d. oberlin @xcite , an improvement to conjecture [ mainc ]",
    "immediately gives an improvement to wolff s bound for furstenberg sets arising from a special  but rather natural  construction .",
    "as far as i know , there is no published evidence of a converse , but it seems very likely that progress in wolff s conjecture [ furstenbergconjecture ] would also lead to progress in conjecture [ mainc ] .",
    "i now concentrate on the case @xmath59 . if @xmath0 and @xmath1 is a borel set with @xmath60 , then @xmath49 , and holds for @xmath11 .",
    "curiously , it appears to be very difficult to capitalise on the stronger assumption @xmath60 , and beat the estimate .",
    "in fact , the only known improvement to kaufman s bound follows  once again  from bourgain s discretised sum - product theorem .",
    "the next theorem appeared in another paper of bourgain @xcite from 2010 :    [ bourgain ] given @xmath61 , there exists @xmath62 such that the following holds . if @xmath1 is a borel set with @xmath60 , then @xmath63 for all @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is an exceptional set of hausdorff dimension @xmath66 .",
    "in particular , @xmath67    in brief , theorem [ bourgain ] marks a substantial improvement over kaufman s bound for values of @xmath2 very close to @xmath35 , but for other values of @xmath68 , kaufman s bound remains the world record .",
    "it is no coincidence that the situation is reminiscent of the known bounds for furstenberg @xmath2-sets , for @xmath2 close to , or far from , @xmath35 .",
    "the second main result of the paper is a small improvement for the packing dimension variant of kaufman s bound , for any @xmath40 :    [ mainprojections ] let @xmath40 . if @xmath1 is a is @xmath69-measurable with @xmath70 , then @xmath17 for some @xmath12 depending only on @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for the appearance of @xmath71 is the same as in theorem [ mainfurstenberg ] , and the proof does not to give any improvement for the dimension of @xmath72 .",
    "the assumption @xmath70 is quite convenient , but nothing more : the proof would also work for borel sets @xmath11 with @xmath60 .    theorem [ mainprojections ] first appeared in a preliminary version of this paper @xcite ( which is now superseded by the current article , and hence not intended for publication ) . in the present paper , the proofs of theorems [ mainfurstenberg ] and [ mainprojections ] are deduced from a single discrete result , theorem [ main ] below , which concerns incidences between certain finite families of points and @xmath36-tubes in the plane . at the level of this incidence result , theorem [ mainprojections ] is strictly easier than theorem [ mainfurstenberg ] , as the relevant families of @xmath36-tubes are somewhat special .",
    "both main results , theorem [ mainfurstenberg ] and [ mainprojections ] , will be proven simultaneously .",
    "section [ reductions ] reduces the proofs to compact sets , and to corresponding claims about upper minkowski dimension ( instead of packing dimension ) .",
    "section [ scalesection ] reduces the proofs further to the discrete result , mentioned above .",
    "section [ incidencesection ]  the main section of the paper  contains and proves the discrete result , theorem [ main ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main ] states , very roughly , the following : if every point in a large , but finite and not - too - concentrated , set @xmath73 meets many @xmath36-tubes with not - too - concentrated angles , then there are either very many tubes altogether , or at least the tubes are difficult to cover by @xmath43-tubes .",
    "the proof has two phases : the first  and longer ",
    "one reduces the proof to sets @xmath74 of a special , product - like , form .",
    "the second phase proves the result for these product - like sets @xmath74 ( see proposition [ productprop ] ) , using some standard tools from additive combinatorics , and eventually reducing matters to a discretised version of bourgain s projection theorem , theorem [ bourgain ] .",
    "an open ball in @xmath75 with centre @xmath76 and radius @xmath77 will be denoted by @xmath78 .",
    "the hausdorff measure and content of dimension @xmath79 will be denoted by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively . given real numbers @xmath82 , the notation @xmath83 means that @xmath84 for some constant @xmath85 . if the dependence of @xmath86 on a parameter @xmath87 needs to be emphasised , i will write @xmath88",
    ". the notation @xmath89 means that @xmath90 , and @xmath91 stands for @xmath92 .",
    "the notation @xmath93 means that @xmath94 for some absolute constant @xmath85 , where @xmath16 is a `` scale '' .",
    "the meaning of @xmath16 will be clear from the context , whenever the notation is used .",
    "the notations @xmath95 and @xmath96 are then defined as above .",
    "given a bounded set @xmath97 , the notation @xmath98 stands for the least number of balls of radius @xmath36 required to cover @xmath99 .",
    "the _ upper minkowski dimension _ of @xmath99 is @xmath100 the _ packing dimension _",
    "@xmath71 is defined in below .",
    "in this short section , i reduce the proofs of theorems [ mainfurstenberg ] and [ mainprojections ] to establishing analogous statements for minkowski dimension ( instead of packing dimension ) , and just for compact sets .",
    "i start with reductions concerning furstenberg sets .",
    "let @xmath1 be an arbitrary furstenberg @xmath2-set , and let @xmath19 be the associated set of unit vectors with @xmath101 .",
    "the definition of packing dimension is @xmath102 where the @xmath103 is taken over all countable covers of @xmath11 with bounded sets @xmath104 . since taking closures does not affect the upper minkowski dimension @xmath105 , one may restrict attention to covers by compact sets @xmath104 .",
    "now , given any @xmath12 , i claim that one of the sets @xmath104 is ( essentially ) a furstenberg @xmath106-set .",
    "this is rather straightforward : since the sets @xmath104 cover @xmath11 , one has @xmath6",
    "= \\sup_{i } { \\dim_{\\mathrm{h}}}[f_{i } \\cap l_{e } ] , \\qquad e \\in s_{k},\\ ] ] so for any fixed @xmath3 , it holds that @xmath107 for some @xmath108 .",
    "consequently , there exists @xmath108 such that @xmath109 for some @xmath110 and for a positive set of vectors @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath104 is a furstenberg @xmath106-set .",
    "since @xmath12 was arbitrary , it follows that it suffices to prove theorem [ mainfurstenberg ] for the minkowski dimension @xmath105 , for compact sets @xmath11 , and under the extra assumption that @xmath111    as a slightly less obvious reduction , i claim that , without loss of generality , one may assume that the lines @xmath4 , @xmath20 , form a compact set . to formalise the statement , i recall the ( standard ) concept of point - line duality in the plane :    [ pointlineduality ] the points in @xmath112 are in one - to - one correspondence with non - vertical lines in @xmath112 via the mapping @xmath113 for every set of points @xmath74 , define the set of lines @xmath114 .",
    "similarly , for a set @xmath115 of non - vertical lines @xmath115 , define the set of points @xmath116 .",
    "a family of lines will be called open / closed / compact etc .",
    "if the point set @xmath117 has the same topological property .",
    "i will also write @xmath118",
    ".    now , let @xmath119 . deleting a set of lines with sufficiently small measure",
    ", one may assume that every line in @xmath120 makes a positive ( and uniformly bounded from below ) angle with the @xmath121-axis .",
    "then @xmath122 is a bounded graph , that is , a set of the form @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a bounded set of positive length , and @xmath125 is a bounded function .",
    "consider the compact line set @xmath126 then every line @xmath127 has the property .",
    "this follows easily from the upper semi - continuity of hausdorff content with respect to hausdorff convergence and the compactness of @xmath11 .",
    "namely , assume for a moment that @xmath127 is such that @xmath128 can be covered by finitely many open balls @xmath129 with @xmath130 choose a sequence of lines @xmath131 converging to @xmath132 locally in the hausdorff metric .",
    "then , using the compactness of @xmath11 , the sets @xmath133 can also be covered by the balls @xmath129 for all @xmath134 large enough , contradicting .",
    "the set @xmath135 may no longer be a graph , but it certainly satisfies @xmath136 .",
    "[ genfs ] let @xmath137 .",
    "assume that @xmath138 is a compact set , and @xmath115 is a compact set of lines with @xmath139 with the property that @xmath140 for every @xmath141 , and for some constant @xmath110 .",
    "also , assume that every line @xmath141 makes an angle @xmath142 with the @xmath121-axis .",
    "then @xmath11 is called a _ generalised furstenberg @xmath2-set_.    by the previous discussion ( and a simple coordinate - change , if necessary , to accommodate the angle requirement ) , the proof of theorem [ mainfurstenberg ] is now reduced to proving to following statement :    [ maingeneralised ] @xmath143 for every generalised furstenberg @xmath2-set @xmath11 , where @xmath12 only depends on @xmath2 .",
    "i now turn to the  much shorter  reduction related to the projection result , theorem [ mainprojections ] .",
    "the following observation is a special case lemma 4.5 in @xcite :    assume that @xmath1 is @xmath69-measurable with @xmath70 , and @xmath144 for some @xmath145 .",
    "then , there exists a compact set @xmath146 with @xmath147 such that @xmath147 and @xmath148    it follows immediately that it suffices to prove theorem [ mainprojections ] for @xmath105 instead of @xmath71 , and for compact sets @xmath11 with @xmath70 .",
    "also , one may restrict attention to the case @xmath149 , since compact subsets with finite measure can always be found , and proving the theorem for any subset implies it for the whole set . for purposes of easy reference ,",
    "i record the result explicitly :    [ mainprojections2 ] let @xmath14 . if @xmath1 is a is compact with @xmath149 , then @xmath150 for some @xmath12 depending only on @xmath2 .",
    "the proofs of both the main theorems are based on counter assumptions .",
    "if theorem [ maingeneralised ] fails , then for arbitrarily small @xmath12 , there exists a generalised furstenberg @xmath2-set @xmath151 such that @xmath152 for all small enough @xmath16 , say @xmath153 .",
    "recall that @xmath154 is the least number of balls of radius @xmath36 required to cover @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , if theorem [ mainprojections2 ] fails , then for arbitrarily small @xmath12 , there exists a number @xmath14 , a compact set @xmath155 with @xmath156 , and a set of vectors @xmath65 with @xmath157 such that @xmath158 for all @xmath159 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to pick the scale @xmath160 so that the information from the counter assumptions and is as useful as possible .",
    "this scale @xmath36 will only be chosen once , but it can be chosen arbitrarily small ( by choosing @xmath161 very small ) .",
    "this will be useful  and implicitly assumed  countless times below .",
    "for example , i will always implicitly assume that @xmath162 is far larger than various constants @xmath85 , which appear throughout the proof .",
    "i start by recalling some basic facts about `` discretising @xmath2-dimensional sets '' .",
    "as far as i know , the following definition is due to katz and tao @xcite :    [ deltasset ] fix @xmath163 .",
    "a finite @xmath36-separated set @xmath164 is called a @xmath165-set , if @xmath166 for all @xmath167 and @xmath168 . here and below",
    ", @xmath169 stands for cardinality .",
    "an open ball of radius @xmath16 will be called a _",
    "@xmath36-ball_. a collection of @xmath36-balls will be called a @xmath165-set , if the centres of the balls form a @xmath165-set .",
    "the following proposition explains the rationale behind @xmath165-sets :    [ deltasset ] let @xmath16 , and let @xmath170 be a set with @xmath171 .",
    "then , there exists a @xmath165-set @xmath172 with cardinality @xmath173 , where @xmath85 is an absolute constant .",
    "the proof is very close to that frostman s lemma ; the details can be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "note that any @xmath165-set @xmath174 satisfies @xmath175 .",
    "so , slightly informally , proposition [ deltasset ] says that sets @xmath176 with @xmath177 contain @xmath165-sets with near - maximal cardinality .",
    "now , i will pick a suitable scale @xmath16 .",
    "recall the sets @xmath178 and @xmath179 . since @xmath178 is a generalised furstenberg @xmath2-set ,",
    "it comes bundled with a compact set of lines @xmath115 with @xmath139 .",
    "clearly , one also may assume @xmath180 , since a finite - measure subset @xmath181 can be found , and then the pair @xmath182 satisfies the same hypotheses as @xmath183 .",
    "let @xmath11 be either one of the sets @xmath179 or @xmath117 , so that @xmath184 and @xmath149 .",
    "i will treat @xmath185 as an absolute constant in the @xmath186-notation below ; in particular @xmath187 .",
    "let @xmath188 be a frostman measure supported on @xmath11 , that is , @xmath189 and @xmath190 for all balls @xmath191 .",
    "next , let @xmath192 be an efficient @xmath193-cover for @xmath11 , that is , @xmath194 one may assume that the diameters of the balls in @xmath192 are of the form @xmath195 , @xmath196 . for @xmath197 , set @xmath198 , and observe that @xmath199 in particular , there exists an index @xmath196 with @xmath197 and @xmath200 here @xmath201 is the smallest number with @xmath202 .",
    "now , i set @xmath203 so that @xmath204 .",
    "note that @xmath205 .",
    "in particular , implies that @xmath206 observe that @xmath207 by , and on the other hand every ball @xmath208 satisfies @xmath209 .",
    "thus , implies that there are @xmath210 balls in @xmath211 , denoted by @xmath212 , such that @xmath213 discarding a few balls if necessary , one may assume that @xmath214 for each ball @xmath215 , choose a @xmath216-set @xmath217 with @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "this is possible by proposition [ deltasset ] , since and the linear growth of @xmath188 imply that @xmath220 . write @xmath221 then @xmath222 , and @xmath223 for @xmath224 .",
    "i will now verify that @xmath74 is a @xmath216-set for some @xmath225 .",
    "fix @xmath226 and @xmath227 , let @xmath224 be the unique ball with @xmath228 .",
    "there are two cases to consider : if @xmath229 , one needs only note that @xmath230 by , and recall that @xmath231 is a @xmath216-set with @xmath218 .",
    "so , let @xmath232 .",
    "this time , if @xmath233 for some ball @xmath234 , then then @xmath235 is large enough to ensure that @xmath236 .",
    "hence , by @xmath237 for @xmath234 , and , and the disjointness of the balls in @xmath212 , one obtains @xmath238    the main achievement of the previous argument was that , for a suitable scale @xmath239 , a @xmath216-set @xmath240 has now been constructed with @xmath225 , along with a family of @xmath43-balls @xmath192 such that    * [ p1 ] @xmath222 , and @xmath241 , * @xmath242 and @xmath243 for all @xmath244 .",
    "next , relying on the counter assumptions and , i will accompany @xmath74 with a finite family of @xmath36-tubes .",
    "for technical reasons , i will consider two types of @xmath36-tubes in this paper : the _ ordinary _ ones , which are nothing but @xmath245-neighbourhoods of lines in @xmath112 , and then the _ dyadic _ ones , which i now proceed to define :    for @xmath246 , @xmath247 , a dyadic @xmath36-tube is a set of the form @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is a dyadic square of side - length @xmath36 , and @xmath250 is the point - line duality mapping from definition [ pointlineduality ] .",

    "@xmath746 tubes remain in each @xmath272 , and then one can re - define @xmath264 as the union of the reduced families @xmath272 .",

    "second , @xmath750 this can be arranged by perturbing the sets @xmath692 slightly and adding a few tubes to @xmath264 .",
    "third , if @xmath751 , and @xmath752 are two tubes both containing certain points @xmath753 and @xmath754 , then @xmath755 can only contain one point in @xmath756 .",
