    "compact gas - embedded clusters are observed to be the formation sites of a significant fraction of stars in the local universe .",
    "following star formation , feedback processes  ranging from protostellar outflows , photoionization - driven gas overpressure , stellar winds to , eventually , supernovae  expel the gas not yet converted into stars .",
    "that is , the efficiency with which a cluster parent core turns its gas into stars is always smaller than 100 per cent .",
    "not only does gas expulsion terminate star formation , it also leaves the newly - formed cluster out - of - equilibrium , thereby forcing it into violent relaxation . in an attempt to regain a state of equilibrium , the cluster expands , loses a fraction of its stars or , even , undergo complete disruption .",
    "these are the _ cluster infant weight - loss _ and _ cluster infant mortality _ , respectively .",
    "the dynamical response of clusters to gas expulsion implies that the cluster age distribution , the cluster mass function , the ratio between the mass in clusters and the mass in stars , as well as the distribution function of cluster half - mass radii all constitute promising diagnostic tools of star cluster formation conditions .",
    "* baumgardt & kroupa ( 2007 ) ) have built and made available to the community an @xmath0-body model grid describing the temporal evolution of cluster mass - loss and cluster spatial expansion for a wide range of local star formation efficiencies ( sfe ; i.e. the mass fraction of dense molecular gas that cluster - forming cores turn into stars ) , gas - expulsion time - scales and external tidal field impacts . to date , this is the most comprehensive grid of model clusters through violent relaxation .",
    "combined to the ever increasing quality of cluster observational data - sets ( including the much needed cluster half - mass radius , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* scheepmaker et al.2007 ) ) , the time is now ripe to decipher observed properties of young star clusters so as to probe their formation and environmental conditions .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "following a brief reminder of violent relaxation chief parameters in section [ sec : parmentier : para ] , i highlight how formation and environmental conditions affect the shape of the cluster mass function in section [ sec : parmentier : mf ] .",
    "i also present some preliminary results about ongoing work regarding the relation between the luminosity of the brightest young cluster and the present star formation rate ( sfr ) of spiral galaxies , namely , the @xmath1 relation ( section [ sec : parmentier : brightest ] ) .",
    "in what follows , the mass of a cluster is defined as the stellar mass enclosed within its tidal radius .",
    "we assume that the impact of the external tidal field arises solely from the smooth gravitational potential of a milky - way - type galaxy , i.e. , at this stage , we neglect the potential impact on the early evolution of a star cluster of its natal giant molecular cloud .",
    "we adopt the jacobi radius of a cluster as an estimate of its tidal radius ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baumgardt et al . , in press ) , their eq .  1 ) .    in the course of violent relaxation",
    ", the mass @xmath2 of a star cluster evolves rapidly and must therefore be defined as an instantaneous quantity .",
    "it obeys : @xmath3    in this equation , @xmath4 is the mass of the cluster - progenitor molecular core , @xmath5 is the local sfe and @xmath6 is the stellar mass fraction of the initially gas - embedded cluster still contained within the cluster tidal radius at time @xmath7 .",
    "when using the term (gas-)embedded cluster mass , this refers to the stellar mass @xmath8 . in all",
    "the work presented here the local sfe is assumed to be uniform among all cores of a given simulation ( i.e. no core - mass dependent sfe ) .",
    "the bound fraction @xmath6 depends on the time @xmath9 elapsed since gas expulsion and on the gas expulsion time - scale @xmath10 ( both expressed in unit of the molecular core crossing - time ) , on the local sfe @xmath5 and on the impact of the external tidal field .",
    "the latter is quantified as the ratio between the half - mass radius @xmath11 and the tidal radius @xmath12 of the gas - embedded cluster ( see below for details ) . the older the cluster and/or the lower the sfe and/or the quicker gas expulsion and/or the stronger the host galaxy tidal field , the lower the bound fraction @xmath6 .",

    "because a cluster expands following gas expulsion , the mass fraction of stars it loses depends on how compact the gas - embedded cluster is compared to its tidal radius @xmath12 .",
    "the impact of the external tidal field is therefore accounted for by the ratio @xmath13 .",
    "as will be shown in section [ sec : parmentier : mf ] , the cluster - forming core mass - radius relation is therefore of paramount importance to the outcome of violent relaxation since it influences both the depth of the core potential well , hence the gas - expulsion time - scale , and the sensitivity to the external tidal field of the exposed cluster ( see also ( * ? ? ? * parmentier 2009 ) ) .",
    "in this section , i show how specific combinations of the core mass - radius relation , local sfe and external tidal field lead to cluster mass functions markedly different from the core mass function and , therefore , to mass - dependent cluster infant mortality .",
    "cluster - forming cores are spatially resolved in the nearby regions of our galaxy only and the slope of the core mass - radius relation remains therefore ill - determined ( see ( * ? ? ? * parmentier , kroupa & baumgardt , subm . ) for a discussion ) .",
    "i consider two extreme cases in turn : constant core radii and constant core surface densities .",

    "a sequence of increasing core mass equates with a sequence of increasing densities and deepening potential wells . as a result ,",

    "* parmentier et al .  ( 2008 ) ) showed that the shape of the post - violent - relaxation cluster mass function is strongly sensitive to the local sfe ( see their figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "while a local sfe @xmath15 is conducive to a cluster mass function mirroring the core mass function ( mass - independent infant mortality and weight - loss ) , a local sfe @xmath16 results in the survival of the  initially  highest - mass embedded - clusters only .",
    "for an exposed cluster to survive so low a local sfe , gas must be expelled adiabatically , a condition which is met by high - mass cores and their deep potential well .",

    "* parmentier et al .  ( 2008 ) ) did not investigate is the time - evolution of the power - law mass function of embedded clusters in the bell - shaped cluster mass function .",
    "the topic of evolving secularly ( i.e. when violent relaxation effects have faded away ) a power - law cluster mass function in a bell - shape is extensively covered in the literature .",
    "starting from a power - law at an age of @xmath1750 - 100myr , internal 2-body relaxation and external tidal stripping preferentially removes low - mass clusters , thereby carving a turnover in the mass function .",

    ", high - mass clusters have a higher density , which results in slower gas expulsion , shorter crossing - time and  once exposed  faster evolution than their low - mass counterparts .",
    ", width=377 ]    this is the perfect example to illustrate that the evolutionary stage of a cluster is not determined by its age in an absolute sense . as for the gas expulsion time - scale ,",
    "what matters is the age expressed in unit of a core crossing - time ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : parmentier : mcl ] ) .",
    "this implies that , keeping all other parameters alike , clusters born in cores of higher densities evolve  once exposed  at a rate faster than those formed out of low - density cores . figure [ fig : parmentier:3snap ]",
    "shows the embedded - cluster mass function ( i.e. the core mass function shifted by @xmath19 in @xmath20 to account for the constant 20 per cent local sfe ) and snapshots of the cluster mass function at ages of @xmath21 and @xmath22myr .",
    "the early cluster mass function ( age @xmath23myr , dotted line with @xmath24-signs ) shows prominent substructures , with the cluster mass still little affected by infant weight - loss in the low- and high - mass regimes ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) .",
    "their origin arises from how the bound fraction @xmath6 evolves with time and as a function of gas - expulsion time - scale . in fig .",
    "[ fig : parmentier : fb ] , the solid and dotted lines show the @xmath6 time - evolutions for explosive ( @xmath27 ) and adiabatic ( here @xmath18 ) gas expulsions , respectively .",
    "a massive embedded cluster ( say , @xmath28 ) expels its residual gas on an adiabatic time - scale and hence retains a bound core of stars in spite of the low sfe of @xmath29 per cent . also , by virtue of the high density of its natal core , a young age of 15myr equates with several hundreds of core crossing - times .",
    "accordingly , cluster violent relaxation is over by this young age .",
    "this is why most of the bell - shape , which arises from clusters initially more massive than @xmath30 , is already carved by an age of 15myr .",
    "in contrast , low - mass clusters ( e.g. @xmath31 ) have low core densities , long core crossing - times and the same age of 15myr equates with a few @xmath32 only , a stage at which the instantaneous bound fraction @xmath6 is still close to unity .",
    "consequently , the low - mass regime of the cluster mass function at an age of 15myr sticks to the embedded - cluster mass function . as clusters age to 50myr , the cluster mass function in the high - mass regime does not evolve anymore and the low - mass regime of the mass function disappears as low - mass objects experience infant - weight loss until their eventual dissolution . +     and the tidal radius @xmath12 of the embedded cluster on its stellar mass @xmath33 for constant surface density cores .",
    "owing to their large spatial extent , high mass clusters show a higher sensitivity to the external tidal field and present a greater likelihood of disruption following gas expulsion.,width=377 ]    .    following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* parmentier et al .  ( 2008 ) ) , molecular cores of constant surface density have an ( almost ) constant gas - expulsion time - scale .",
    "yet , the infant mortality and infant weight - loss rates of their embedded clusters are markedly mass - dependent owing to the tidal field impact .",
    "we insist that this effect takes place even if all cores are located within the same limited region of a galaxy within which the external tidal field does not vary markedly .",
    "the ratio between the initial half - mass radius and initial tidal radius of these embedded clusters scales as @xmath34 and , therefore , high - mass clusters have a greater sensitivity to the external tidal field since the volume of space in which they can freely expand is smaller than for low - mass clusters when compared to the initial cluster size .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : parmentier : rhrt ] where the core mass - radius relation is @xmath35pc , the local sfe is @xmath36 and the galactocentric distance is @xmath37kpc in a milky - way - like potential . as a result",

    "fig : parmentier : mf_sb ] ) .",
    "+    the key - point to retain from this section is that the shape of the cluster mass function , the mass - radius relation of cluster - forming cores , their local sfe and the external tidal field are intimately entwined issues .",
    "that most observed mass functions of young clusters are power - laws with a spectral index @xmath38 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "( 2007 ) ) for a possible turnover in the cluster mass function of the antennae merger ngc  4038/39 ) therefore tells us something about cluster formation conditions which are common to different types of cluster environments .",
    "the high sensitivity to the external tidal field of high - mass cores of constant surface density may be a hint that , contrary to theoretical expectations , the index @xmath39 of the mass - radius relation @xmath40 of cluster - forming cores is shallower than @xmath41 .",
    "more simulations are required to settle this point definitively .",
    "in particular , greater attention must be paid to cluster radius - related quantities , e.g. the distribution function of young cluster half - mass radii and the reason why clusters lack a clear mass vs. half - mass radius correlation ( ( * ? ? ? * larsen 2004 ) ) .",
    "we will investigate these aspects in a forthcoming paper .",
    "myr . as can be understood from fig .",

    "time spans in the history of galaxies characterized by vigorous star formation therefore show up prominently in cluster age histograms for two reasons : _ ( i ) _  the number of clusters is larger and _ ( ii ) _  these more numerous clusters also include more massive ones which experience longer dissolution time - scales and which are therefore more likely to be observed .",

    "the @xmath1 relation gets shallower when the sfr increases due to the greater sensitivity to the external tidal field of high - mass embedded clusters and hence the larger amount of infant - loss they experience .",
    "in contrast , for constant core radii , it gets steeper towards higher sfr as , in this case , higher mass cores experience slower gas expulsion and thus retain a larger bound fraction of stars .    in the case illustrated in fig .  [",

    "the core mass function is a schechter function with a spectral index @xmath38 and its break - mass @xmath47 has been adjusted so that , following star formation and infant weight - loss , the break - mass of the cluster mass function is about @xmath48 as observed for spiral galaxies ( ( * ? ? ? *",

    "we emphasize once again that the simulation time span ( 10myr ) is shorter than the age range of clusters shown in this plot ( @xmath45myr ) .",
    "since the model vertical location is also cluster - age dependent through both the amount of infant weight - loss and the cluster mass - to - light ratio , the limited time span of our simulations prevents us from drawing firm conclusions about the best local sfe estimate .",
    "having now a firm handle of how cluster formation and environmental conditions affect the relation between the present sfr and the mass of the young most massive cluster , we are ready to perform simulations on a grander scale encompassing @xmath49myr of dynamical evolution and in which cluster mass - to - light ratio variations will be taken into account .",
    "this will give us a _ lower _ limit on the local sfe in gas - embedded clusters of spiral galaxies , the actual value depending on the importance of the distributed mode of star formation .",
