    ". mixing assumptions are convenient in this context because they measure how events generated by time series observations  rather than the observations themselves  relate to one another and therefore also measure dependence of functions of such time series .",
    "the downside to these assumptions is that they can be hard to verify for a given application .",
    "@xcite describes alternatives and considers parametric classes of functions that behave like mixingales , but his results come at the expense of lipschitz continuity conditions on these functions and rule out many applications of interest .    in this paper",
