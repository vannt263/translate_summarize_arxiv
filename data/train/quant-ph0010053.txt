    "quantum communication experiments widely use dielectric four - port devices such as beam splitters or optical fibers as basic elements for constructing optical quantum channels . since any frequency - dependent dielectric function describing an optical element , by virtue of the kramers - kronig relations , is necessarily a complex function of frequency ,",
    "absorption is always present which leads to well - known phenomena as decoherence and entanglement degradation . in order to study the problem , quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of dielectric media",
    "is needed .",
    "a consistent formalism of quantum electrodynamics in absorbing media is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the green function expansion of the electromagnetic field with respect to the fundamental variables of the system composed of the field , the dielectric matter and the reservoir .",
    "all relevant information about the dielectric and geometric properties are contained in the classical green function of the corresponding scattering problem .",
    "the formalism is especially suited for deriving input - output relations of the field at dielectric slabs @xcite on the basis of measurable quantities as transmission and absorption coefficients . from the input - output relations",
    "we can then derive closed formulas for calculating the output quantum state from the ( known ) input quantum state @xcite .",
    "that is , the complete density matrix after the transformation is known , which makes the theory most suitable for studying entanglement properties of quantum states of light .",
    "the theory has also been extended to cover amplifying media .    in this article",
    "we will proceed as follows .",

    "we shortly review the basic formulas needed for the following considerations .",
    "suppose the electromagnetic field has already been quantized and the green function for a four - port device has been rewritten in the form of transmission and absorption matrices @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the amplitude operators of the incoming and outgoing damped waves at frequency @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , can then be connected by the quantum - optical input - output relations in the following way : @xmath5 with @xmath6 where @xmath7 represent either device annihilation operators @xmath8 for absorbing devices ( @xmath9 ) or creation operators @xmath10 for amplifying devices ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ 1.2 ] ) is nothing but current ( or energy ) conservation .",
    "the formulas are valid for any chosen frequency .    by defining the `` four - vector '' operators @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 for an absorbing device , and for an amplifying device , with @xmath16 being some auxiliary bosonic ( `` two - vector '' ) operator . the input - output relation ( [ 1.2 ] ) can then be extended to the four - dimensional transformation @xmath17 with @xmath18 the matrix @xmath19 is either an element of the compact group su(4 ) ( for absorbing devices ) or of the non - compact group su(2,2 ) ( for amplifying devices ) . by introducing the ( commuting ) positive hermitian matrices",
    "@xmath20 which , by eq .",

    "equivalently , the wigner function ( for arbitrary @xmath25-parametrized phase - space functions , see @xcite ) transforms as @xmath26 = w_{\\rm in}\\big[{\\bf j } { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}^+(\\omega ) { \\bf j } { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\alpha$}}(\\omega)\\big ] .\\ ] ]",
    "let us make first a general remark on entanglement transformation .",
    "one of the requirements to be satisfied by any entanglement measure @xmath27 is that a cp map does not increase entanglement @xcite , that is , @xmath28 looking at eq .",
    "( [ 1.8 ] ) , we see that a quantum - state transformation is in fact a cp map for both absorbing and amplifying four - port devices because in both cases an ancilla ( the device ) is coupled to the hilbert space of the field , a unitary transformation is performed in the product space @xmath29 , and the trace with respect to the device is taken at the end .",
    "an obvious consequence is that amplification does not help to increase entanglement .",
    "now we turn to the problem of transmitting two light beams prepared in an entangled quantum state through absorbing optical fibers represented by their transmission coefficients @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ eightport ] ) .    as an example",
    "let us consider the two types of bell states @xmath31 applying eq .",

    "it is seen that the entanglement of the states @xmath44 decays considerably faster than that of the states @xmath45 , which can be understood from the argument that in the former case absorption acts on both photons simultaneously .",
    "since the states considered here live in hilbert spaces with dimension 2@xmath462 it would also be possible to compute the exact amount of entanglement by applying the theorem of lewenstein and sanpera @xcite which states that in that case the equality sign in ( [ 2.5 ] ) is realized for a decomposition of the density matrix in the form @xmath47 @xmath48 with maximal @xmath49 .    as a second example ,",

    "since the criterion is based on properties of the wigner function for gaussian states , we can readily use eq .",

    "the quantum - state transformation can be used to derive upper bounds on the entanglement content of a given quantum state of the incoming field .",
