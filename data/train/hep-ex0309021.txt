    "`` physicists , colleagues , friends , lend us your ears  we have come to praise charm , not bury it ! ''",
    "we have chosen such a theatrical opening not merely to draw your attention to our review .",
    "we feel that charm s reputation  like caesar s  has suffered more than its fair share from criticisms by people that are certainly honourable . of course , unlike in caesar s case the main charge against charm is not that it reaches for the crown ; the charge against charm is one of marginality , i.e. that charm can teach us nothing of true consequence any longer : at best it can serve as a tool facilitating access to something of real interest  like beauty ; at worst it acts as an annoying background  so goes the saying .",
    "our contention instead is :    * while charm of course had an illustrious past , which should not be forgotten and from which we can still learn , * it will continue to teach us important lessons on _ standard model _ _ ( sm ) _ dynamics , some of which will be important for a better understanding of beauty decays , and * the best might actually still come concerning manifestations of _ new physics_.    the case to be made for continuing dedicated studies of charm dynamics does _ not _ rest on a single issue or two : there are several motivations , and they concern a better understanding of various aspects of strong and weak dynamics .    in this article",
    "we want to describe the present state - of - the - art in experiment and theory for charm studies .",
    "we intend it to be a self - contained review in that all relevant concepts and tools are introduced and the salient features of the data given .",
    "our emphasis will be on the essentials rather than technical points .",
    "yet we will provide the truly dedicated reader with a cicerone through the literature where she can find all the details .",
    "we sketch charm s place in the @xmath1  why it was introduced and what its characteristics are  and the history of its discovery .",
    "then we describe the basic features of the experimental as well as theoretical tools most relevant in charm physics .",
    "subsequent chapters are dedicated to specific topics and will be prefaced with more to the point comments on the tools required in that context : production , spectroscopy and weak lifetimes .",
    "we shall then address exclusive leptonic , semileptonic and nonleptonic transitions , before we cover @xmath0 oscillations , cp violation and the onset of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this discussion prepares the ground for an evaluation of our present understanding ; on that base we will make a case for future studies of charm physics .",
    "unlike for strangeness the existence of hadrons with the quantum number charm had been predicted for several specific reasons and thus with specific properties as well .",
    "nevertheless their discovery came as a surprise to large parts or even most of the community @xcite .",
    "strangeness acted actually as a ` midwife ' to charm in several respects . extending an earlier proposal by gell - mann and levy , cabibbo @xcite made the following ansatz in 1963 for the charged current j_^(+ ) [ j_^(- ) ] = cos_c |d_l_u_l [ |u_l_d_l]+ sin_c |s_l_u_l [ |u_l_s_l ] [ cabibbocur ] ( written in today s notation ) , which successfully describes weak decays of strange and nonstrange hadrons . yet commuting @xmath2 with its",
    "conjugate @xmath3 yields a _",
    "neutral _ current that necessarily contains the @xmath4 term sin@xmath5 cos@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "yet such a strangeness changing neutral current ( schnc ) is phenomenologically unacceptable , since it would produce contributions to @xmath7 and @xmath8 that are too large by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the match between leptons and quarks with three leptons  electrons , muons and neutrinos  and three quarks  up , down and strange  had been upset already in 1962 by the discovery that there were two distinct neutrinos .",
    "shortly thereafter the existence of charm quarks was postulated to re - establish the match between the two known lepton families @xmath9 and @xmath10 with two quark families @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "later it was realized @xcite that the observed huge suppression of strangeness changing neutral currents can then be achieved by adopting the form j_^(+ ) = |d_c , l_u_l & + & |d_c , l_c_l + d_c = cos_c d + sin_c s & , & s_c = -sin_c d + cos_c s [ gimcurrent ] for the charged current .",
    "the commutator of @xmath2 and @xmath3 contains neither a @xmath13 nor a @xmath14 piece .",
    "even more generally there is no contribution to @xmath7 in the limit @xmath15 ; the gim mechanism yields a suppression @xmath16 . from the value of @xmath7 one",
    "infers @xmath17 gev .",
    "this procedure can be illustrated by the quark box diagram for @xmath18 oscillations , fig.([fig : box ] ) .",
    "it is shown for a two - family scenario , since the top quark contribution is insignificant for @xmath19 ( though it is essential for @xmath20 ) .",
    "oscillations [ fig : box],height=113 ]    , height=113 ]    to arrive at a renormalisable theory of the weak interactions one has to invoke non - abelian gauge theories @xcite . in those the gauge fields couple",
    "necessarily to the charged currents and their commutators thus making the aforementioned introduction of charm quarks even more compelling .",
    "yet one more hurdle had to be passed .",
    "for there is still one danger spot that could vitiate the renormalizability of the standard model .",
    "the so - called triangle diagram , see fig.([fig : anomaly ] ) , has a fermion loop to which three external spin - one lines are attached  all axial vector or one axial vector and two vector : while by itself finite it creates an anomaly , the adler - bell - jackiw ( abj ) anomaly .",
    "it means that the axial vector current even for _ massless _ fermions ceases to be conserved on the loop , i.e. quantum level .",
    "the thus induced nonconservation of the axial current even for massless fermions creates infinities in higher orders that can not be removed in the usual way .",
    "the only way out is to have this anomaly , which does not depend on the mass of the internal fermions , cancel among the different fermion loops . within the sm this requires the electric charges of all fermions  quarks and leptons - to add up to zero .",
    "with the existence of electrons , muons , up , down and strange quarks already established and their charges adding up to @xmath21 , this meant that a fourth quark with three colours was needed each with charge @xmath22  exactly like charm .",
    "there is an ironic twist here : as described below , the discovery of open charm hadrons was complicated and therefore delayed , because the charm threshold is very close to the @xmath23 lepton threshold ; cancellation of the abj anomaly then required the existence of a third quark family ( which in turn allows for cp violation to be implemented in the sm in charged current couplings ) .",
    "the fact that charm ` bans ' these evils is actually the origin of its name .",
    "it was the first quark flavour _ pre_dicted , and even the salient features of charm quarks were specified :    * they possess the same couplings as @xmath24 quarks , * yet their mass is much heavier , namely about 2 gev .",
    "* they form charged and neutral hadrons , of which in the @xmath25 sector three mesons and four baryons are stable ; i.e. , decay only weakly with lifetimes of very roughly @xmath26 sec  an estimate obtained by scaling from the muon lifetime , as explained below . *",
    "charm decay produces direct leptons and preferentially strange hadrons .",
    "* charm hadrons are produced in deep inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "glashow reiterated these properties in a talk at ems-74 , the 1974 conference on experimental meson spectroscopy and concluded @xcite :    \" what to expect at ems-76 : there are just three possibilities :    1 .",
    "charm is not found , and i eat my hat .",
    "charm is found by hadron spectroscopers , and we celebrate .",
    "charm is found by outlanders , and you eat your hats . \"    a crucial element in the acceptance of the @xmath27 theory as the sm for the electroweak forces was the observation of flavour - conserving neutral currents by the gargamelle collab . at cern in 1973 . despite this spectacular success in predicting weak neutral currents of normal strength in the flavour - conserving sector together with hugely suppressed ones for @xmath13 transitions ,",
    "the charm hypothesis was not readily accepted by the community  far from it . even after the first sightings of charm hadrons",
    "were reported in cosmic ray data @xcite , a wide spread sentiment could be characterized by the quote : `` nature is smarter than shelly [ glashow ] ... she can do without charm . '' in the preface we have listed three categories of merits that charm physics can claim today . here",
    "we want to expand on them , before they will be described in detail in subsequent sections .    *",
    "the production and decays of strange hadrons revealed or at least pointed to many features central to the sm , like parity violation , the existence of families , the suppression of flavour - changing neutral currents and cp violation .",
    "charm physics was likewise essential for the development of the sm : its foremost role has been to confirm and establish most of those features first suggested by strange physics and thus pave the way for the acceptance of the sm .",
    "it did so in dramatic fashion in the discovery of charmonium , which together with the observation of bjorken scaling in deep inelastic electron - nucleon scattering revealed quarks acting as dynamical degrees of freedom rather than mere mathematical entities .",
    "the demands of charm physics drove several lines in the development of accelerators and detectors alike .",
    "the most notable one is the development of microvertex detectors : they found triumphant application in charm as well as in beauty physics ",
    "they represent a conditio sine qua non for the observation of cp violation in @xmath28  and in the discovery of top quarks through @xmath29-flavour tagging , to be followed hopefully soon by the discovery of higgs bosons again through @xmath29-flavour tagging",
    ". some might scoff at such historical merits . we , however , see tremendous value in being aware of the past  maybe not surprisingly considering where two of us live and the other two would love to live ( we are not referring to south bend here . ) . * the challenge of treating charm physics _",
    "quantitatively _ has lead to testing and refining our theoretical tools , in particular novel approaches to qcd based on heavy quark ideas",
    ". this evolutionary process will continue to go on .",
    "the most vibrant examples are lattice qcd and heavy quark expansions described later . * charm",
    "can still ` come through ' as the harbinger or even herald of new physics .",
    "it is actually qualified to do so in a unique way , as explained in the next section .",
    "charm quarks occupy a unique place among up - type quarks . _ top _ quarks decay before they can hadronize @xcite , which , by the way , makes searches for cp violation there even more challenging . on the other end of the mass spectrum",
    "there are only two weakly decaying light flavour hadrons , namely the neutron and the pion : in the former the @xmath30 quark decays and in the latter the quarks of the first family annihilate each other .",
    "the charm quark is the only up - type quark whose hadronization and subsequent weak decay can be studied .",
    "furthermore the charm quark mass @xmath31 provides a new handle on treating nonperturbative dynamics through an expansion in powers of @xmath32 .",
    "decays of the down - type quarks @xmath33 and @xmath29 are very promising to reveal new physics since their ckm couplings are greatly suppressed , in particular for beauty .",
    "this is not the case for up - type quarks .",
    "yet new physics beyond the sm could quite conceivably induce flavour changing neutral currents that are larger for the up - type than the down - type quarks . in that case charm",
    "decays would be best suited to reveal such non - standard dynamics .",
    "a candidate event for the decay of a charm hadron was first seen in 1971 in an emulsion exposed to cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "it showed a transition @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting a charged hadron that could be a meson or a baryon .",
    "it was recognized that as the decaying object @xmath36 was found in a jet shower , it had to be a hadron ; with an estimated lifetime around few@xmath37 it had to be a weak decay .",
    "assuming @xmath35 to be a meson , the mass of @xmath36 was about 1.8 gev .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite analyzed various interpretations for this event and inferred selection rules like those for charm .",
    "it is curious to note that up to the time of the @xmath38 discovery 24 papers published in the japanese journal _ prog .",
    "theor . physics _ cited the emulsion event versus only 8 in western journals ; a prominent exception was schwinger in an article on neutral currents @xcite .",
    "the imbalance was even more lopsided in experimental papers : while about twenty charm candidates had been reported by japanese groups before 1974 , western experimentalists were totally silent @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that kobayashi and maskawa working at nagoya university in the early 70 s were encouraged in their work  namely to postulate a third family for implementing cp violation  by knowing about niu s candidate for charm produced by cosmic rays .",
    "afterwards the dams against postulating new quarks broke and a situation arose that can be characterized by adapting a well - known quote that `` ... nature repeats itself twice , ... the second time as a farce '' .",
    "it was pointed out already in 1964 @xcite that charm hadrons could be searched in multilepton events in neutrino production .",
    "indeed evidence for their existence was also found by interpreting opposite - sign dimuon events in deep inelastic neutrino nucleon scattering @xcite as proceeding through @xmath39 .",
    "the october revolution of 74  like any true one  was preceded by a period where established concepts had to face novel challenges , which created active fermentation of new ideas , some of which lead us forward , while others did not .",
    "this period was initiated on the one hand by the realization that spontaneously broken gauge theories are renormalizable , and on the other hand by the slac - mit study of deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "the discovery of approximate bjorken scaling gave rise to the parton model to be superseded by qcd ; the latter s ` asymptotic freedom '  the feature of its coupling @xmath40 going to zero ( logarithmically ) as @xmath41  was just beginning to be appreciated .",
    "attention was turned to another deep inelastic reaction , namely @xmath42 . in some quarters there",
    "had been the expectation that this reaction would be driven merely by the tails of the vector mesons @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 leading to a cross section falling off with the c.m .",
    "energy faster than the @xmath46 dependence of the cross section for the ` point like ' or ` scale - free ' process @xmath47 does .",
    "on the other hand it was already known at that time that within the quark - parton model the transition @xmath42 would show the same scale - free behaviour at sufficiently high energies leading to the ratio @xmath48 being a constant given by the sum of the quark electric charges squared .",
    "the three known quarks @xmath24 , @xmath30 and @xmath33 yield @xmath49 .",
    "it was pointed out by theorists that having three colours would raise @xmath50 to a value @xmath51 .",
    "yet the data seemed to paint a different picture .",
    "data taken at the adone storage ring in frascati yielded @xmath52 at @xmath53 gev .",
    "the old cambridge electron accelerator ( cea ) in massachusetts was converted to an @xmath54 machine in 1972 .",
    "measurements made there showed no signs of @xmath50 decreasing : @xmath55 and @xmath56 at @xmath57 and @xmath58 gev , respectively . yet these findings were not widely accepted as facts due to the low acceptance of the detectors .",
    "the first measurement of @xmath54 annihilation with a large acceptance detector was performed by the mark i collaboration at slac s spear storage ring for @xmath59 gev .",
    "when their initial results were announced at the end of 1973 , they caused quite a stir or even shock .",
    "they established that @xmath50 was indeed in the range of @xmath60 and not falling with energy . the publicly presented data with their sizeable error bars actually seemed to show @xmath50 rising like @xmath61 meaning @xmath62 approaching a constant value @xcite .",
    "this was taken by some , including a very prominent experimentalist , as possible evidence for electrons containing a small hadronic core .",
    "the 74 revolution thus shares more features with other revolutions : in the end it did not produce the effect that had emerged first ; furthermore even prominent observers do not own a reliable crystal ball for gazing into the future . rather than revealing that electrons are hadrons at heart , it showed that quarks are quite similar to leptons at small distances .",
    "the new physics invoked to induce the rise in @xmath50 was parameterized through four - fermion operators built from quark and lepton bilinears .",
    "some amusing effects were pointed out @xcite : if the new operators involved scalar [ pseudoscalar ] fermion bilinears , one should see @xmath62 decrease [ increase ] _ with time _ from the turn - on of the beams . for in that case the cross section would depend on the transverse polarization of the incoming leptons , and the latter would grow with time due to synchrotron radiation . later more precise data did away with these speculations .",
    "they showed @xmath50 to change with @xmath63 as expected from crossing a production threshold .",
    "other theoretical developments , however , turned out to be of lasting value . in a seminal 1973 paper @xcite m.k .",
    "gaillard and b. lee explored in detail how charm quarks affect kaon transitions  @xmath18 oscillations , @xmath64 , @xmath65 etc .",
    " through quantum corrections .",
    "their findings firmed up the bound @xmath66 gev .",
    "together with j. rosner they extended the analysis in a review , most of which was written in the summer of 1974 , yet published in april 1975 @xcite with an appendix covering the discoveries of the fall of 1974 . at the same time",
    "it was suggested @xcite that charm and anticharm quarks form unusually narrow vector meson bound states due to gluons carrying colour and coupling with a strength that decreases for increasing mass scales .",
    "the theoretical tools were thus in place to deal with the surprising observations about to be made .",
    "it is fair to say that the experimental signatures described above did not convince the skeptics  they needed a damascus experience to turn from",
    "` saulus ' into ` paulus ' , from disbelievers into believers .",
    "such an experience was provided by the october revolution of 1974 , the discovery of the @xmath38 and @xmath67 viewed as absurdly narrow at the time .",
    "it provides plenty of yarn for several intriguing story lines @xcite .",
    "one is about the complementarity of different experiments , one about the value of persistence and of believing in what one is doing and there are others more . on the conceptual side",
    "these events finalized a fundamental change in the whole outlook of the community onto subnuclear physics that had been initiated a few years earlier , as sketched above : it revealed quarks to behave as real dynamical objects rather than to represent merely mathematical entities .",
    "one exotic explanation that the @xmath38 represents an @xmath68 bound state fell by the wayside after the discovery of the @xmath67 .",
    "the two leading explanations for the new threshold were charm production and ` colour thaw ' .",
    "since the early days of the quark model there were two types of quarks , namely the gell - mann - zweig quarks with fractional charges and the han - nambu @xcite quarks with integer charges . of those there are",
    "actually nine grouped into three triplets , of which two contained two neutral and one charged quark and the last one two charged and one neutral quark .",
    "the han - nambu model was actually introduced to solve the spin - statistics problem of baryons being s - wave configuration of three quarks .",
    "the idea of ` colour thaw ' is to assume that up to a certain energy each of the three triplets acts _ coherently _ reproducing results as expected from gell - mann - zweig quarks , i.e. @xmath69 . above this energy those ` colour ' degrees of freedom get liberated to act _ incoherently _ as nine quarks producing @xmath70 !    charm gained the upper hand since it could provide a convincing explanation for the whole family of narrow resonances as ` ortho- ' and ` para - charmonia ' in a dramatic demonstration of qcd s asymptotic freedom . `",
    "colour thaw ' could not match that feat .    yet",
    "the final proof of the charm hypothesis had to be the observation of open charm hadrons .",
    "in one of the ( fortunately ) rare instances of nature being malicious , it had placed the @xmath71 threshold close to the charm threshold .",
    "typical signatures for charm production  increase production of strange hadrons and higher multiplicities in the final state  were counteracted by @xmath72 events , the decays of which lead to fewer kaons and lower hadronic multiplicities .",
    "it took till 1976 till charm hadrons were observed in fully reconstructed decays .",
    "the need for the quantum number ` colour ' had arisen even before the emergence of qcd as the theory for the strong interactions . on the one hand",
    "there was the challenge of reconciling fermi - dirac statistics with identifying the @xmath73 baryon as an @xmath74 system in the symmetric @xmath75 combination : having colour degrees of freedom would allow for the wavefunction being odd under exchange for an s - wave configuration . on the other hand",
    "the aforementioned avoidance of the abj anomaly implied the existence of three colours for the quarks .    `",
    "colour ' is of course central to qcd .",
    "its introduction as part of a non - abelian gauge theory is required by the need for a theory combining asymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet and confinement in the infrared . with three colours @xmath76 combinations",
    "can form colour singlets .",
    "it should be noted that studying @xmath77 around the charm threshold revealed several other manifestations of colour :    * ( i ) * it had been noted before the discovery of the @xmath38 that three colours for quarks are needed to also accommodate the observed value of @xmath78 within quark dynamics . yet",
    "this argument was not viewed as convincing till data indeed showed that @xmath50 below and ( well ) above the charm threshold could be adequately described by two ` plateaus ' ",
    "i.e. relatively flat functions of the c.m .",
    "energy  with their difference in height approximately @xmath79 .    *",
    "( ii ) * the amazingly narrow width of the @xmath38 resonance can be ascribed naturally to the fact that the decay of this ortho - charmonium state to lowest order already requires the @xmath80 to annihilate into three gluons making the width proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "it is amusing to remember that one of the early competitors to the @xmath82 explanation for the @xmath38 was the speculation that the colour symmetry is actually broken leading to the existence of non - colour singlets in the hadronic spectrum .    *",
    "( iii ) * the lifetime of @xmath23 leptons is reproduced correctly by scaling it from the muon lifetime @xmath83 with @xmath84 ; @xmath85 or @xmath86 would not do .",
    "likewise for the prediction of the leptonic branching ratio br@xmath87 for @xmath84 .",
    "this is remarkably close to the experimental number @xmath88 with the difference understood as due to the qcd radiative corrections . *",
    "( iv ) * similar estimates were made concerning the lifetime and semileptonic branching ratio for charm .",
    "yet the former is a rather iffy statement in view of @xmath89 and the complexity of defining a charm _",
    "quark _ mass .",
    "the latter , which argues in favour of @xmath90 ( again modulo qcd radiative corrections ) is actually fallacious if taken at face value .",
    "these two points will be explained in sect .",
    "[ weaklife ] .",
    "the birth of the charm paradigm and its experimental confirmation fostered a time of development in experimental techniques , which has few parallels in the history of high energy . for charm was predicted with a set of properties that facilitate their observation .",
    "its mass was large by the times standards , but within reach of existing accelerators .",
    "it possessed charged current couplings to @xmath30 and @xmath33 quarks , and therefore should be visible in neutrino beams available then ; @xmath91 colliders had come into operation .",
    "open charm would decay preferentially to final states with strangeness , making them taggable by particle i d detectors able to discriminate kaons from protons and pions .",
    "hidden charm states would have a large decay rate to lepton pairs providing a clean and signature .",
    "charm lifetimes would be small , but within reach experimentally .",
    "charm would decay semileptonically , thus providing chances of observing the relatively easy to detect muon .",
    "in this section we will retrace the historical development , from which we will draw lessons on the production environments - focusing on various colliders versus fixed target set - ups - and then sketch key detector components .        the @xmath92 was discovered simultaneously 1974 by two experiments , one at the brookhaven fixed target machine with 30 gev protons and the other one at slac s spear @xmath91 collider , neither of which was actually searching for charm",

    "a very rich and gratifying experimental program was pursued at spear and doris by a succession of experiments : mark i - iii , crystal ball , dasp , pluto etc .",
    "their achievements went well beyond mapping out charmonium spectroscopy in a detailed way : a host of new experimental procedures was established  actually a whole style of doing physics at a heavy flavour ` factory '",

    "indirect evidence for their existence surfaced in neutrino experiments .",

    "neutrino - induced @xmath106 events were seen @xcite indicating that the new resonance was correlated with strangeness in weak reactions as required by the presence of charm .    an intense hunt for finding charm hadrons at accelerators",

    "was gradually replaced by computer techniques  from semi - automatic scanning machines @xcite to fully automatic systems driven by the forward spectrometer tracking information @xcite . the new technique saved time in both finding and reconstructing candidate events without introducing a bias in event selection . in 1979 , in a few months five thousand events were analysed in an experiment on negative pion beam of 340 gev at cern @xcite , and the huge ( at the time ) number of four charm pairs , five charged and three neutral charm particles were detected .",
    "these improved emulsion techniques were applied in full to study charm neutrino production by e531 at fermilab and by chorus at cern . the e531 collaboration @xcite collected more than 120 charm events ; among its most notable results was the confirmation of the lifetime differences first seen in cosmic ray data a few years earlier @xcite .",
    "this new technique contributed also to early beauty searches .",

    "both beauty hadrons @xmath99 and @xmath111 were detected , and their decays into charmed particles observed clearly showing the full sequence of decays from beauty to light quark .",
    "wa75 detected about 200 single charm pairs events , among them two peculiar ones with simultaneous production of two pairs of charm .",
    "the chorus detector@xcite combined a nuclear emulsion target with several electronic devices . by exploiting a fully automated scanning system it localized , reconstructed and analysed several hundred thousand interactions",
    ". a sample of about 1000 charm events , a ten - fold increase over e531 , was obtained by chorus .",
    "this big sample should allow the measurement of the , so far never measured , total charmed - particle production inclusive cross - section in antineutrino induced event @xcite .    the scanning speed achievable with fast parallel processors increases by about one of magnitude every three years .",
    "soon a scanning speed of 20  @xmath112s should be possible@xcite .",
    "these developments assure a continuing presence of emulsion techniques in high energy physics .",
    "bubble chambers made important contributions as well .",
    "charm decays were seen in the 15  ft bubble chamber at fermilab @xcite .",
    "very rapid cycle bubble chambers coupled with a forward magnetic spectrometer contributed since the early days of charm physics at fermilab @xcite and cern @xcite .",
    "lebc was utilized by na16 and na27 searching for charm states at cern , while slac operated the shf ( slac hybrid facility ) .",
    "yet these devices have remained severely limited in the statistics they can generate , due to low repetition rate of 20 - 40 hz , the short sensitivity time 200 microseconds , and to the small fiducial volume .",
    "thus they are of mainly historical interest now .",
    "charm quark physics witnessed in a very distinct fashion the very transition from image to logic@xcite which is common to several fields of particle physics . turning point of such transition was the replacement of emulsions and bubble chambers with electronic imaging devices .",
    "the na1 experiment at cern was one of the first experiments that introduced silicon and germanium devices into the field .",
    "this was soon followed by one of the major breakthroughs in the detector techniques of the last 20 years : the silicon microstrip high - resolution vertex detector .    to measure lifetimes ,",
    "na1 used a telescope composed of several silicon detectors ( 150 - 300 microns thick ) with beryllium sheet targets in between , installed directly in the photon beam fig.[fig : na1 ] .",
    "the telescope acts as an active target : when an interaction occurs , the silicon device detects the energy released by the recoil system ( the nuclei or a proton ) and by particles emerging from the interaction points .",
    "the pattern on the detected energy in the subsequent detectors identifies production and decay locations along the silicon telescope .",
    "the recoil fragment or nucleon releases sufficient energy to identify the interaction point even when the emerging particles were neutral .",
    "the ideal sequences of energy - deposited steps are shown in fig.[fig : na1 ] , for photoproduction of both charged and neutral charmed mesons pairs compared to a typical event configuration .",
    "the first determination of the time evolution curve of a charmed particle was obtained by na1 collaboration with this innovative device proving a lifetime of @xmath113  s out of a sample of 98 events @xcite . na1",
    "published data also on the @xmath114 lifetime and production asymmetry@xcite .",
    "finally microstrip vertex detectors were brought to the scene .",
    "this new device allowed one to perform tracking of particles trajectories upstream of the forward spectrometer magnetic field , and to reconstruct with precision the primary ( production ) and the secondary ( decay ) vertices of short living particles in the events .",
    "it moved lifetime determinations to the fully digital state and also opened the field to search and study specific decay channels .",
    "microstrip vertex detectors are composed of several stations , each formed of three microstrip planes typically 200 - 300 micron thick , with strips running at different orientation . between the target ( passive cu or be bulk or active silicon telescope ) where the interaction occurs ( primary vertex ) , and the subsequent decay ( secondary vertex ) there is an empty region were most of the searched decays should happens , whose size must be optimised taking into account expected lifetimes and their relativistic boost .",
    "a second series of microstrip detectors is placed at the secondary vertex location and downstream to it .",
    "this configuration allows one to reconstruct the sequence of decay vertices , and to link emitted tracks to those reconstructed in the forward spectrometer .",
    "the strips typically were 20 - 100 micron wide , 20 - 50 micron pitch .",
    "spatial resolutions on the plane perpendicular to the beam of the order of several microns were obtained . the multiple coulomb scattering limits to 4 - 5  mm the total thickness allowed .",
    "the first examples of this kind of apparatus are accmor@xcite on hadron beams and na14 ( fig.[fig : na14 ] ) , e691 ( fig.[fig : e691 ] ) on photon beams .    by the mid-80 s fixed target experiments using microstrip vertex detectors",
    "had become mature , the technique migrated from cern to the us , experiments with thousands of channels were built and took data for more than ten years .",
    "the two main experiments at fixed target were operated at fnal : e691 @xcite ( later running also as e769 and e791 ) and e687@xcite , later upgraded to e831-focus .",

    "threshold machines like spear and doris in the past , bes in the present and also cleo - c in the future allow many unique measurements benefiting from low backgrounds and beam - energy constraints .",
    "they suffer somewhat from the fact that the two charm hadrons are produced basically at rest thus denying microvertex detectors their power .",
    "a @xmath115 factory , as lep and slc have been , on the other hand benefits greatly from the hard charm fragmentation : the high momenta of the charm hadrons and their ` hemispheric ' separation allows to harness the full power of microvertex detectors ; similar for beauty hadrons .",
    "the lep experiments aleph , delphi , l3 and opal together with sld have made seminal contributions to our knowledge of heavy flavour physics in the areas of spectroscopy , lifetimes , fragmentation functions , production rates and forward - back asymmetries .",
    "the advantage of @xmath99 factories is their huge statistics with low background level .",
    "we are probably not even near the end of the learning curve of how to make best use of it .",
    "photoproduction experiments have been a crucially important contributor .",
    "the charm production rate is about 1/100 of the total rate with a final state that is typically of low multiplicity .",
    "a crucial element for their success was the ability to track the finite decay paths of charm hadrons routinely , which has been acquired due to the dedicated r & d efforts described above .",
    "their forte is thus in the areas of time - dependent effects like lifetimes , @xmath117 oscillations and cp violation there .",
    "the largest cross sections for charm production are of course found in hadroproduction . in high energy _ fixed target _",
    "experiments one has to deal with a signal to background of a priori about 1/1000 with high multiplicity final states .",
    "that this challenge could be overcome again speaks highly of the expertise and dedication of the experiments . at hadron colliders like the tevatron the weight of the charm cross section",
    "is higher  about 1/500 of the total cross section  yet so is the complexity of the final state .",
    "cdf , which previously had surprised the community by its ability to do high - quality beauty physics , is pioneering now the field of charm physics at hadron colliders with its ability to trigger on charm decays .",

    "the distinct properties predicted for charm decays ( mentioned in sect.[expinst ] : short but finite lifetime , dominance of kaon decays , relevant branching ratio for semimuonic decays ) gave a definite roadmap for the development of new experimental techniques .",
    "experiments suddenly converted on flight their objectives to the new physics quests , and a big r&d adventure started to conceive new devices able to reach the needed spatial resolutions .",
    "this pushed the migration of the semiconductor detector technique from nuclear to high - energy experiments .",
    "first ideas relied on silicon active targets , where jumps in silicon pulse height would be a signal for jumps in charged particle multiplicity , i.e. , of a charm decay point .",
    "space resolution was limited by the thickness of the silicon targets .",
    "key element for the transition to modern charm lifetime measurements was the silicon microstrip detector .",
    "such a transition could not have been accomplished without the development of daq systems able to handle the very large dataflow provided by the huge number of channels in microstrip detectors .",
    "the advantage given by the lorentz boost at fixed - target experiment was immediately realized .",
    "it was also realized that , given the statistical essence of the lifetime measurement , a very large data sample was needed to reach high statistical precisions .",
    "porting of silicon microstrips to collider charm experiment is a relatively recent history pioneered by cleo , and fully embraced by b - factories by the usage of asymmetric beams in order to avail of some lorentz boost .",
    "silicon pixels were the natural quantum leap from microstrip detectors , providing two - dimensional readout , reduced thickness and therefore less multiple scattering , lower track occupancy and better space resolution , at the cost of a much increased number of readout channels .",
    "in the course of r&d for vertex detectors for charm , several good ideas were investigated , such as the use of scintillating fibers as micron - resolution tracking devices@xcite which did not last in charm physics but had many applications in hep , or elsewhere .",
    "vertex reconstruction for charm decays is intimately linked to the possibility of triggering on it .",
    "charm physics at hadron colliders was born very recently with the success obtained by cdf at tevatron in exploiting a hadronic trigger based on the online reconstruction of vertex impact parameters .",
    "future experiments such as btev at fermilab ( see sect.[btev ] ) plan an aggressive charm physics program based on a first level trigger selecting events with secondary vertices reconstructed in pixel detectors .",
    "particle identification , namely the rejection of pions and protons against kaons , was immediately recognized as a winner in charm physics . in pioneer @xmath91 experiments",

    "ring - imaging cerenkov counters only appeared at @xmath91 colliders with cleo , and have been further improved with b - factories .",
    "the unique role of semielectronic and semimuonic decays in understanding the underlying hadron dynamics gave momentum to electron and muon particle identification techniques , with collider experiments traditionally more efficient in identifying the former , and fixed target experiments favoured by the higher muon momentum is deploying muon filters and detectors .",
    "finally , electromagnetic calorimetry was recognized as a necessity in charm physics by cleo  ii , with the operation of a world - class csi crystal array .",

    "there is much more involved than a ` merely academic ' interest in fulling understanding all aspects of qcd : studying the onset of the quark - gluon plasma and its properties can teach us essential lessons on the formation of neutron stars and other exotic celestial objects and even on the early universe as a whole .    following the analogy with qed one undertakes to create a high energy density of roughly @xmath160 ( compared to @xmath161 for ordinary cold nuclear matter ) by colliding heavy ions against each other .",
    "if this energy density is maintained for a sufficiently long time , a phase transition to the de - confined quark - gluon plasma is expected to occur with ensuing thermalization .",
    "the crucial question is which experimental signatures unequivocally establish this occurrence .",
    "one of the early suggestions @xcite has been that a _ suppression _ in the production of heavy quarkonia like @xmath38 , @xmath67 , @xmath162 etc . can signal the transition to the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this is based on a very intuitive picture : the high gluon density prevalent in the plasma ` debye'-screens the colour interactions between the initially produced @xmath163 and @xmath164 quarks and other quarks as well .",
    "after the matter has cooled down re - establishing the confining phase , hadronization can take place again . yet",
    "the @xmath163 and @xmath164 quarks have ` lost sight ' of each other thus enhancing the production of charm hadrons at the expense of charmonia even more than under normal conditions , i.e. when hadronization is initiated _ without _ delay .",
    "more specific predictions can be made @xcite : the more loosely bound @xmath67 is even more suppressed than @xmath38 , one expects certain distributions in @xmath165 and feynman @xmath166 @xcite etc .",
    "gross features of these predictions have indeed been observed in heavy ion collisions at the cern sps and at rhic by the na38 @xcite , na50 @xcite and phenix @xcite collaborations , respectively .",
    "these findings were indeed interpreted as signaling the transition to the quark - gluon plasma . however this conclusion has been challenged by authors @xcite , who offered alternative explanations for the observed suppression that does not invoke the onset of the quark - gluon plasma . a better understanding of charmonia production in ordinary proton - nucleus would certainly help to clarify this important issue . alternatively one can probe more detailed features of charmonium production , like the polarization of @xmath38 and @xmath67 @xcite . as described in sect.[oniumprod ] the application of nrqcd to this problem has so far been met with less than clear success , which could mean that _ non_perturbative dynamics can not be treated by nrqcd , at least not for charmonia .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma might offers a scenario where nrqcd s _ perturbative _ features can be tested and vindicated .",

    "we divide candidate discoveries into three categories , namely those that will certainly make it onto the ` valhalla ' list , those that are likely to do so and those with no more than an outside chance ; a necessary condition for all three categories of discoveries is of course that they happen .",
    "any measurement that unequivocally reveals the intervention of new physics falls into this category . finding any mode with lepton number violation like @xmath167 or @xmath168 , sect.[dmue ] , or with a familon @xmath169 , sect.[familon ] , qualifies as would @xmath170 in clear excess of the sm prediction , sect.[evenrarer ] .",

    "it means that discoveries in this category can hope for elevation to valhalla only if they receive an _ unequivocal theoretical _ interpretation and/or provide important input to other measurements of pantheon standing .",
    "this is best illustrated by the first example .    in sect.[ddosc ] we have expressed skepticism about our ability to base a conclusive case for new physics on the observation of @xmath117 oscillations .",

    "it is even more essential that unambiguous measurements are matched with a clear - cut theoretical interpretation .",

    "the pursuit of those goals requires even larger samples of high quality data .",

    "a synopsis of existing and planned initiatives was shown in sect .",
    "[ keycomp ] , tables [ tab : expts ] and [ tab : future ] .      with the end of fixed target programs at the fermilab tevatron and the cern sps ,",
    "no photoproduction experiments with real photons are planned .",
    "focus still has significant new analyses in progress and under active consideration , and will provide results in channels such as semileptonics , all - charged hadronic decays , and spectroscopy .",
    "the two experiments h1 and zeus at hera will refine and extend their analysis of charm ( and even beauty ) production and fragmentation in the next few years , until their shutdown planned for 2007 .",
    "collisions of on- and off - shell photons ( and off - shell weak bosons ) with protons provide a dynamical environment more involved than @xmath54 annihilation , yet less complex than hadronic collisions . as an extra bonus one can even study the transition to hadroproduction by going from the deep inelastic regime in momentum transfers ",
    "gev@xmath180  to @xmath181 .      after having",
    "proved to the scientific community the feasibility of doing first - class b physics at a hadron collider , cdf is now opening a new chapter in the study of charm hadrons at the tevatron by triggering on them .",
    "this new ability will give us access to huge statistics .",
    "we can expect  or at least hope  that , even after severe cuts , the available data samples will be of unprecedented size , thus allowing us to study single and multiple charm production including their correlations , and the excitations and decays of single and double charm baryons and their decays .",
    "it might even extend considerably our sensitivity for @xmath117 oscillations , as well as cp violation accompanying them and in dalitz plot distributions , where the normalization is not essential .",
    "the ultimate surprise from cdf would be the ability to decently reconstruct in their electromagnetic calorimeters photons and neutral pions from charm decays .",
    "the compass experiment @xcite at cern was proposed in 1996 with a `` phase ii '' devoted to charm hadroproduction and a full spectrum of intended measurements , from lifetimes to spectroscopy , measurement of @xmath171 and searches for @xmath117 oscillations and cp violation .",
    "the experiment is currently taking data in its muonproduction mode for structure functions measurements .",
    "the hadroproduction `` phase ii '' foreseen for 2006 will be devoted to production of exotics and glueballs , and to some charm physics items @xcite .",
    "they plan to collect @xmath182 fully recostructed charm events in a one - year running of @xmath183 .",
    "the most emphasized item is @xmath178 baryon spectroscopy . assuming @xmath178 baryons are produced at the selex rate with respect to @xmath114 , sect.[c2bar ] , scaling rates up and considering efficiencies and acceptances via simulation , they end up with an estimate of @xmath184 reconstructed @xmath178 baryons .",
    "a more pessimistic estimate based on measured hadroproduction cross section for @xmath25 baryons scaled to @xmath178 production yields about 100 reconstructed @xmath178 baryons .",
    "the @xmath99 factories at kek and slac have had a spectacularly successful start - up with respect to both their technical performance thus exceeding its design goal of @xmath185 , while kek - b had established a new world record of @xmath186 . ] and the impact of their measurements .",
    "for those have already promoted the ckm description of heavy flavour dynamics from an ansatz to a tested theory .",
    "they are also highly efficient factories of charm hadrons .",
    "there are three sources for their production : ( i ) continuum production ; ( ii ) production of single charm hadrons in @xmath99 decays driven by @xmath187 and ( iii ) production of a pair of charm hadrons or of charmonium in @xmath99 decays due to @xmath188 .",
    "there are further advantages beyond the sample size : the multiplicities in the final states are relatively low ( though not as low as at a tau - charm factory ) ; good vertexing is available and the two @xmath99 decays can in general be separated on an event by event basis ; in particular for charm emerging from @xmath99 decays several correlations with quantum numbers like beauty , strangeness , lepton number etc . can be exploited .",
    "such methods will become especially powerful once one has accumulated sample sizes of about 500 @xmath189 for @xmath190 , which might be the case by 2005 , and has succeeded in fully reconstructing one of the beauty mesons in about @xmath191 events @xcite .",
    "one can then study the decays and decay chains of the other beauty mesons with exemplary cleanliness .",
    "this should allow us to study @xmath0 oscillations with excellent control over systematics and enable us to measure certain quantities for the first time like the absolute values for charm _",
    "baryon _ branching ratios @xcite .",
    "studying charm decays at threshold in @xmath54 annihilation offers many unique advantages :    * threshold production of charm hadrons leads to very clean low multiplicity final states with very low backgrounds .",
    "* one can employ tagged events to obtain the _ absolute _ values of charm hadron branching ratios in a model independent way .",
    "* likewise one can measure the widths for @xmath192 and @xmath193 with unrivaled control over systematics . * with the charm hadrons being produced basically at rest the time evolution of @xmath108 decays can not be measured directly . yet by comparing epr correlations in @xmath110 decays produced in @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 one can deduce whether oscillations are taking place or not , as explained in sect.[ddosc ] .",
    "one such machine has been operating since 1990 , namely the bepc collider with the bes detector in beijing .",
    "presently they are running with a luminosity of @xmath197 at the @xmath38 .",
    "there are plans for upgrades leading to considerably increased luminosities in the near future .",
    "to fully exploit the advantages listed above one can not have enough luminosity .",
    "several proposals have been discussed over the last 15 years for tau - charm factories with the ambitious goal of achieving luminosities of up to the @xmath198 range for the c.m .",
    "energy interval of 3 - 5 gev .",
    "one such project is realized at cornell university .",
    "they plan to operate cesr - c with luminosities @xmath199 in the range @xmath200 gev for three years starting in 2003 using a modified cleo - iii detector .",

    "data samples of that size and cleanliness would provide ample material for many important studies of the sm :    * they will presumably complete the charmonium spectroscopy , provide authoritative answers concerning charmonium hybrids and clarify the situation with respect to candidates for glueballs and hybrids in charmonium decays like @xmath210 .",
    "* cleo - c s measurements of the widths for @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 will be in a class by themselves : with an integrated luminosity of 3 @xmath189 the uncertainties are expected to be in the 3 - 5 % regime , about an order of magnitude better than what is achievable at the @xmath99 factories with an integrated luminosity of 400 @xmath189 ! * the absolute branching ratios for nonleptonic decays like @xmath214 and @xmath215 [ @xmath216 will be measured with uncertainties not exceeding the 1% [ 2% ] level .",
    "the improvement over the present situation would be even greater for charm baryon decays .",
    "* significant improvements in the direct determination of @xmath217 and @xmath218 from @xmath219 and @xmath220 modes could be obtained .",
    "* one could measure the lepton spectra in inclusive semileptonic decays separately for @xmath108 , @xmath108 and @xmath221 mesons .",
    "absolute charm branching ratios and decay sequences represent important engineering inputs for @xmath99 decays , and the present uncertainties in them are becoming a bottleneck in the analysis of beauty decays .    extracting precise numbers for the decay constants @xmath171 and @xmath172 provides important tests for our theoretical control over qcd as it is achievable through lattice qcd as described before .",
    "the same motivation applies to _ exclusive _ semileptonic @xmath110 decays : to which degree one succeeds in extracting the values of @xmath218 and @xmath217  assumed to be known by imposing three - family unitarity on the ckm matrix  provides a sensitive test for the degree to which lattice qcd can provide a quantitative description of nonperturbative dynamics and can be trusted when applied to _ exclusive _ semileptonic decays of beauty mesons .    comparing the measured lepton spectra in _ inclusive _",
    "semileptonic decays separately for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath221 mesons with expectations based on the @xmath32 expansion can provide us with novel lessons on the on - set of quark - hadron duality .",
    "all of this can be summarized by stating that a tau - charm factory provides numerous and excellent opportunities to probe or even test our mastery over qcd .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether searches for @xmath0 oscillations and cp violation can be extended in a more than marginal way , as long as the luminosity stays below @xmath222 .",
    "the gsi laboratory in germany has submitted a proposal for building a new complex of accelerators on its site .",
    "one of its elements is hesr , a storage ring for antiprotons with energies up to 15 gev .",
    "it might allow an experimental program contributing to three areas of charm physics :    * in @xmath223 annihilation  implemented with internal targets  one can exploit the superior energy calibration achievable there  @xmath224 100 kev vs. @xmath224 10 mev in @xmath54 annihilation  to add to our knowledge on charmonium spectroscopy and to search for charm(onium ) hybrids through formation as well as production processes .",
    "the methodology employed would be an extension of what was pioneered by the isr experiment r 704 and the fnal experiments e 760/e 835 .",
    "* one can study open charm production in @xmath103 collisions with heavy nuclei like gold .",
    "the goal is to analyze how basic properties of charm quarks like their mass are affected by the nuclear medium , i.e. whether it really lowers their masses , as discussed in sect.[hvynucl ] . * since @xmath225 annihilation is driven by the strong forces , it leads to huge data samples of charm hadrons , which could be employed to look for novel phenomena like cp violation in the charm meson sector .",
    "of course , one needs very clean signatures since there is a huge background of non - charm events . for the same reason this is not an environment for precision measurements .",
    "the btev experiment @xcite at the fermilab tevatron was proposed to measure oscillations , cp violation and rare decays in both charm and beauty decays .",
    "the goal is _ to perform an exhaustive set of measurements of beauty and charm particle properties in order to overdetermine the parameters of the ckm matrix , and to either precisely determine sm parameters or to discover inconsistencies revealing new physics_.    production of beauty and charm hadrons in @xmath226 interactions at 2  tev center of mass energy is peaked in forward - backward regions within a few hundreds milliradians .",
    "the experiment thus has effectively a fixed - target geometry .",
    "initially conceived as a two - arm spectrometer , btev , due to funding constraints , is now proposed and awaiting approval with a one - arm detector .",
    "while the btev detector is made of the standard set of subdetectors for charm and beauty physics ( including state - of - the - art em calorimetry ) , the feature that should allow it to be a protagonist in charm physics is the first level trigger on detached vertices , which makes btev efficient for fully hadronic final states . in one year of data taking @xmath227 at a luminosity of @xmath2282s1 @xmath229 @xmath230 pairs will be produced . with a 1% trigger efficiency and 10% reconstruction efficiency",
    ", btev expects @xmath231 _ reconstructed _ charm decays in one year ( in addition to @xmath232 reconstructed @xmath233 and 1500 @xmath234 ) .",
    "btev will be able to perform all studies done so far by fixed - target experiments with the higher hadronic background supposedly tamed by superior detector solutions both in tracking ( pixel detector ) , and in neutral reconstruction ( crystal em calorimeter ) .",
    "as far as charm is concerned major emphasis is placed on probing high - impact physics topics such as @xmath235 oscillations , cp violation and doublecharm spectroscopy .    with @xmath231 reconstructed",
    "charm decays , btev expects to reach a sensitivity of @xmath236 on the oscillation parameter @xmath237 in both semileptonic and hadronic final states . with",
    "@xmath191 reconstructed , background - free scs decays , the sensitivity to cp violating asymmetries will be of order @xmath138 ; btev will thus enter the range of sm predictions for direct cp violation there .",
    "particular care will be taken to keep the systematics under sufficient control .",
    "the definition of the primary vertex and secondary interactions in the target , which were the main sources of systematic errors at fixed - target experiments , will not be an issue here .",
    "btev is anticipated to measure semileptonic formfactors with a percent level precision  similar to what is expected from cleo - c , yet with very different systematics .",
    "finally btev s photon reconstruction capability will allow high sensitivity probes of @xmath238 . within the sm they are  unlike @xmath239  dominated by long - distance dynamics with predictions for their branching ratios ranging from @xmath240 up to @xmath126 .",
    "these rates can be significantly enhanced in susy scenarios with the comparison of @xmath241 versus @xmath242 providing an important diagnostic .",
    "the tau - charm factory with the precise measurements it will allow has been called a `` qcd machine '' .",
    "such a label implies that a quantitatively precise theoretical treatment of charm(onium ) transitions can be given .",
    "lattice qcd represents our best bet in this respect .",
    "this theoretical technology has made considerable progress through the creation of more efficient algorithms together with the availability of ever increasing computing power .",
    "we have certainly reason to expect such progress to continue .",
    "one can also benefit from two complementary approaches to treating charm physics on the lattice : one can approach the charm scale from below largely by ` brute force ' , i.e. by using finer and larger lattices ; or one can approach it from above by scaling down from the heavy quark limit and from @xmath29 quarks . in either case it will be essential to perform fully unquenched lattice simulations of qcd , which seems to be within reach .",
    "in particular the recent ` manifesto ' of ref . @xcite expresses considerable optimism that a real breakthrough in this direction is happening right now . in any case",
    "there is good hope that the anticipated progress in our experimental knowledge of charm dynamics will be matched by progress in our theoretical understanding with _",
    "defendable _ theoretical uncertainties in the decay constants and semileptonic formfactors on the percent level .",
    "the discovery of charm states achieved much more than ` merely ' establish the existence of a second complete quark family ",
    "it marked a true paradigm shift in how the community viewed quarks : before the observation of bjorken scaling in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering quarks were regarded by many as objects of mathematical convenience ; certainly after the discoveries of @xmath38 and @xmath96 they were seen as real physical objects albeit confined ones .",
    "many important lessons of philosophical , historical and sociological relevance on progress in general and in the sciences in particular can be drawn from this transition    it also gave nature an opportunity to show its kindness , which is much more than its customary lack of malice : the discovery of charm mesons with lifetimes @xmath243 sec provided the impetus for developing a new _ electronic _ technology to resolve such lifetimes , namely silicon microvertex detectors .",
    "those were ready ` just in time ' to take on another challenge , namely measuring lifetimes of beauty hadrons .",
    "resolving track lengths of a particle with a lifetime @xmath243 sec is to first order equivalent to that of a particle with three times the lifetime and mass .",
    "the silicon technology has been and is still experiencing spectacular success in tracking @xmath134 oscillations , cp asymmetries in @xmath244 and tagging top quark decays through beauty hadrons in their final state .",
    "@xmath99 tagging is also an essential tool in searching for higgs bosons .",
    "more generally the search for and analysis of charm hadrons gave rise to new detector components , trigger devices and experimental setups and strategies that are now firmly established in the mainstream of hep .",
    "they have met with spectacular successes in beauty physics .",
    "every truly good story actually points to the future as well and in more than one way , and this is certainly the case here as well .",
    "the thesis of this review is that a strong case can be made for continuing dedicated studies of charm dynamics to be pursued at existing facilities like cleo - c , the @xmath99 factories at kek and slac and fnal s tevatron collider .",
    "this case rests on three pillars , one experimental and two more of a theoretical nature :    * more precise data on charm spectroscopy and decays are needed as _ engineering input _ for refining our analysis of beauty decays . to cite but one non - trivial example concerning the determination of @xmath245 : to extract @xmath246 including its uncertainty accurately from real data",
    ", one has to know the masses , quantum numbers and decays of the various charm resonances and combinations occurring there .",
    "this applies also when measuring @xmath247 , @xmath248 at zero recoil .",
    "* likewise the theoretical tools for treating beauty decays rely on input from the charm sector .",
    "consider the just mentioned example : sum rules derived from qcd proper relate the contributions of different charm resonances to semileptonic @xmath99 decays to the basic heavy quark parameters that in turn control the theoretical expressions for @xmath99 decay rates .",
    "+ furthermore the tools for describing beauty decays have not only been developed first for charm decays , but can still be calibrated and refined with more precise and comprehensive charm data .",
    "this will enhance considerably their credibility in treating beauty decays .",
    "this is true for considerations based on quark models , light cone sum rules , hqe and in particular for lattice qcd as described in the previous section . in particular for the validation of the latter charm can act as an important bridge , since lattice qcd should be able to approach charm dynamics from higher as well as lower scales . *",
    "the existence of charm hadrons and their basic properties has provided essential confirmation for the sm . yet at the same time it offers a unique angle to searches for physics beyond the sm , which is ` orthogonal ' to other approaches .",
    "in contrast to @xmath33 and @xmath29 quarks charm is an up - type quark ; unlike top it hadronizes and can thus exhibit coherent phenomena that enhance cp asymmetries nor @xmath134 oscillations , and cp violation could not manifest itself through @xmath249 or in @xmath250 . ]",
    "this will however not happen ` automatically '  dedicated efforts will be required .",
    "the fact that no new physics has shown up yet in charm transitions should not at all deter us from continuing our searches there . on the contrary it has been only very recently that we have entered the experimental sensitivity level in @xmath0 oscillations and cp violation , where a signal for new physics would be believable . finally , experience has shown time and again that when one gives hep groups data and time , they will find novel ways to formulate questions to nature and understand its replies .",
    "an artist once declared that true art is due to 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration , i.e. committed long term efforts .",
    "this aphorism certainly applies to progress in fundamental physics as demonstrated by charm s tale .",
