    "the spatial association of grb  980425 with the unusual type ib / c supernova sn1998bw at @xmath8 provided the first tantalizing evidence that some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are related to the end - stages of the lives of massive stars @xcite .",

    "the association of grbs with star - forming regions is important for models of their progenitors and can be used to probe the physics of star formation and the global star - formation history of the universe @xcite .",
    "grb  990712 was first localized by _ bepposax _ and detected as having the strongest @xmath10-ray afterglow observed to date @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a bright , decaying optical afterglow ( oa ) ( @xmath11 ) four hours after the burst . @xcite",
    "measured a preliminary redshift of @xmath12 from a set of absorption and emission lines , which makes it the nearest grb with a secure redshift that has been observed to date ( apart from sn1998bw ) .",
    "eso new technology telescope images obtained 3.7 days after the burst led @xcite to hypothesize the existence of a bright host galaxy with @xmath13 on the grounds of an apparent leveling off of the light curve relative to the suspected power - law decline ( @xmath14 ) @xcite of the oa .",
    "subsequent eso very large telescope imaging @xcite confirmed the leveling off of the light curve , and yielded evidence for the existence of an extended object contributing to the flux at the position of the grb .",
    "@xcite predicted that the existence of a sn would lead to a bump in the light curve around 1 august 1999 , and that a sn model could be distinguished from a no - sn model in late _ hst _  and ground - based imaging , as the oa would be brighter and the host fainter in the sn scenario than in the no - sn scenario .",
    "these predictions are presented in @xcite , which reports the discovery and early light curve of the oa of grb  990712 .    in this _ letter _",
    "we present late _",
    "hst _ imaging , as well as ground - based imaging and spectroscopy , aimed at testing these predictions . at the time of the _ hst _ observations the @xmath15-band magnitudes of the host galaxy and the oa",
    "are predicted to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the sn scenario , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the no - sn scenario .",
    "we assume a standard friedman cosmology with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . at @xmath23",
    "this corresponds to a scale of 5.6 proper kpc per arcsecond , a luminosity distance of 2.37 gpc , a distance modulus of 41.88 , and a look - back time of 4.9 gyr .",
    "including a cosmological constant of @xmath24 increases these values by @xmath25% .",
    "direct images were obtained with the dfosc on the danish 1.54-m telescope at la silla on 7 ( @xmath15 band ) and 9 ( @xmath26 band ) october 1999 ut , i.e. , 87 and 89 days after the burst .",
    "exposure times were @xmath27 minutes in each band and the seeing full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) was @xmath28 . the photometry was carried out using sextractor v2.0.13 @xcite .",
    "the calibration was tied to the internal reference stars of @xcite and gave @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the galaxy at the location of the grb .",
    "two more @xmath15 images ( 120 sec and 180 sec ) were obtained with the eso 3.6-m telescope on 12 november 1999 ut ( 123 days after the burst ) in @xmath31 seeing ( see  [ section : spectra ] ) .",
    "these images yielded @xmath32 for the host galaxy .",
    "the ground - based images thus showed no signs of a transient source .",
    "the photometry is consistent with host magnitudes of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "_ hst _ observations of the oa were made on 29 august 1999 ut , 47.7 days after the burst , as part of the cycle  8 program go-8189 .",
    "six 620 second exposures were taken with the stis in each of its 50ccd ( clear , hereafter referred to as cl ) and f28x50lp ( long pass , hereafter referred to as lp ) modes .",
    "the ccd gain was set to 1 e@xmath35/adu , giving a read - out noise of 4 e@xmath35/pixel , and the data was processed through the standard stis pipeline .",
    "we retrieved this data from the _ hst _ data archive and combined the images using the dither ( v1.2 ) software @xcite as implemented in iraf ( v2.11.1)/stsdas ( v2.0.2 ) .",

    "figure  [ figure : galaxy ] shows the drizzled cl image of the probable host galaxy .",
    "conversion from counts to @xmath38 magnitudes was achieved using the zero points given in the stis instrument handbook .",
    "we assumed that the galaxy had a power - law spectrum of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is constant , and converted the @xmath38 magnitudes to standard johnson @xmath26- and kron - cousins @xmath15-band magnitudes using @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents the @xmath26- or @xmath15-band magnitude , as appropriate , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the instrumental @xmath38 magnitudes measured in the cl and lp filters , @xmath45 is the appropriate zero point , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the central frequencies of the cl and lp filters , and @xmath48 .",
    "we estimated the total @xmath38 magnitude of the oa on both the cl and the lp images by using the daophot / allstar ii @xcite photometry package . a point - spread function ( psf )",
    "was constructed in the manner described in  4 of @xcite .",
    "the oa was identified by matching the coordinates of the oa given by @xcite to the cl and lp stis images , and looking for point sources inside the @xcite error circle ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : galaxy ] ) .",
    "the allstar `` sharp '' statistic is related to the angular size of an object relative to a psf .",
    "isolated point sources will have `` sharp '' values of @xmath49 while extended sources will have `` sharp '' values @xmath50 .",
    "the only point source ( `` sharp '' @xmath51 in the cl filter and @xmath52 in the lp filter ) on the stis images that lies within the error circle is located @xmath53 ( @xmath54 drizzled stis pixels ) from the @xcite position for the oa . therefore , we conclude that this point source is the oa for grb  990712 .",
    "the brighter , point - like feature 024 to the southeast of the oa has `` sharp '' @xmath55 in the cl filter which suggests that it is the nucleus of the galaxy and not a point source ( see   [ section : host ] ) .",
    "aperture corrections were performed by using the daophot ii addstar routine to generate an artificial star with the same instrumental magnitude as the oa and measuring the total flux in apertures with radii of @xmath56 ( cl ) and @xmath57 ( lp ) .",
    "tables  14.3  and  14.5 of the stis instrument handbook suggest that these radii correspond to @xmath58% of the encircled energy in the psf .",
    "the oa magnitudes are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which yields a color of @xmath61 .",
    "the galactic reddening towards the oa ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath65 and @xmath66 to obtain extinction - corrected magnitudes of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "a visual examination of each stis image , after the psf for the oa has been subtracted , shows that we have slightly oversubtracted the oa .",
    "we estimate that this oversubtraction has resulting in our magnitudes being overestimated by at most @xmath69 mag in the @xmath26 band and @xmath70 mag in the @xmath15 band .",
    "therefore , the true magnitudes of the oa are @xmath71@xmath72 and @xmath73@xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding range in color is @xmath75@xmath76 , and in spectral index is @xmath77 .",
    "we used the eso faint object spectrograph and camera 2 ( efosc2 ) , mounted at the cassegrain focus of the eso 3.6-m telescope , to obtain a 30-minute optical spectrum of the host galaxy of grb  990712 on 12 november 1999 ut .",
    "the weather conditions were good , with @xmath31 seeing and photometric sky .",

    "the slit was @xmath81 wide and oriented along the parallactic angle .",
    "the data were reduced with iraf and the ctio long - slit package .",
    "a spectrum of the standard star ltt9491 @xcite was used to perform the relative flux calibration . as the standard was observed with a relatively narrow slit ( @xmath81 ) , we tied the absolute flux calibration to our measurement of the @xmath26-band flux for the galaxy .    the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ figure : spectrum ] ) exhibits four prominent narrow ( unresolved ) emission lines which we identify as [ ] @xmath823727 , h@xmath834861 , and [ ] @xmath844959,5007 .",

    "the host galaxy is an extended source with elliptical isophotes , a bright , concentrated nucleus , and a bright , extended feature to the northwest of the nucleus .",
    "the nucleus has a fwhm of @xmath101 ( @xmath102 kpc ) in the cl filter , which is only slightly wider than the psf .",
    "there is some indication that the isophotes twist to the north at the northwest end of the galaxy and to the south at the southeast end .",
    "the integrated @xmath26- and @xmath15-band magnitudes of the galaxy were obtained by subtracting the light from the oa and performing aperture photometry with an aperture of radius @xmath103 in each of the cl and lp images .",
    "the measured spectral index is @xmath104 , and eq .",
    "[ equation : mag ] yields @xmath105 and @xmath106 . correcting for galactic extinction , and assuming no internal extinction in the host galaxy ,",
    "gives @xmath107 .",
    "for @xmath23 the observed @xmath15-band is approximately equivalent to the rest - frame @xmath108-band , so @xmath109 .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath110 in the rest frame for blue galaxies with redshifts of @xmath111 .",
    "this corresponds to the host galaxy for grb  990712 having @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the @xmath108-band luminosity of a typical blue galaxy at @xmath23 .",
    "we estimated the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in the host galaxy using eq .  2 of @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "the total sfr is @xmath114@xmath115 yr@xmath116 , depending on the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the sfr is corrected for extinction in our galaxy , but it assumes that there is no dust , or obscured star formation , in the host galaxy .",
    "this is probably a poor assumption so our derived sfr should be considered to be a lower limit on the true sfr in the host .",
    "the implied [ ] luminosity ( table  [ table : lines ] ) , corrected for galactic extinction , is @xmath117  erg  s@xmath116 .",
    "if we assume that the strength of the [ ] line is related to star formation then this corresponds to a sfr of @xmath118 yr@xmath116 @xcite .",
    "this is 23 times as large as the sfr derived from the continuum flux , possibly indicating internal extinction in the host or a contribution from non - thermal emission .",
    "the derived sfr ( from the [ ] flux ) is @xmath119% of the sfr found by @xcite for the host of grb  990123 and comparable to that of the host of grb  970508 @xcite .",
    "the specific sfr per unit luminosity of the grb  990712 host galaxy is @xmath120 times that of the host galaxies of grb  990123 and grb  970508 .",
    "the oa is located in the bright , extended source @xmath121 ( @xmath122 kpc ) to the northwest ( @xmath123 north of east ) of the nucleus ( see fig .  [",
    "figure : galaxy ] ) .",
    "this region has a fwhm of @xmath124 ( @xmath125 kpc ) , which is significantly more extended than the stis psf ( fwhm @xmath126 ) .",
    "the surface brightness , after subtracting the oa and correcting for galactic extinction , is @xmath127 and @xmath128 for an integrated color of @xmath129 .",
    "the oa is located @xmath130 ( @xmath131 pc ) south of the center of this extended structure .",
    "the total @xmath26-band flux in the feature , after subtracting the flux from the [ ] emission line , is @xmath132 @xmath133jy . assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath134 the sfr is @xmath135@xmath136 yr@xmath116 depending on the imf .",
    "again , we wish to stress that this is a lower limit on the true sfr in the feature . the estimated sfr is approximately one third of the sfr that @xcite found for the star - forming region that coincides with the position of grb  990123 whereas the diameters and luminosities are comparable .",
    "the spectroscopic data demonstrate that all emission lines , both forbidden and permitted , have narrow widths that are consistent with a seyfert  2 galaxy ( the instrumental resolution only gives an upper limit on the rest - frame velocity widths of a few hundred @xmath137 ) .",
    "the ratio [ ] /h@xmath94 is greater than three , which is indicative of an active galaxy @xcite .",
    "the object lies on the borderline between regions and narrow - line agns in the @xmath138[]@xmath139 vs.@xmath138[]/ [ ] ) diagram ",
    "uncorrected for extinction , see @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the host galaxy of grb  990712 may be a seyfert  2 galaxy , but further spectroscopic observations will be needed to confirm this .",
    "for example , a measurement of @xmath138[]@xmath140 from near - ir spectroscopy would discriminate between a star - forming galaxy or a seyfert  2 @xcite .",
    "cccc    @xmath141 & @xmath142 & @xmath143 & @xmath144 + @xmath145 & @xmath146 & @xmath17 & @xmath147 + @xmath148 & @xmath149 & @xmath150 & @xmath151 + @xmath152 & @xmath153 & @xmath154 & @xmath155 + @xmath156 & @xmath18 & @xmath16 & @xmath157 + @xmath158 & @xmath159 & @xmath160 & @xmath161 +    table  [ table : predictions ] summarizes the predicted and observed @xmath26- and @xmath15-band magnitudes for the oa and its host galaxy in both the pure power - law ( pl ) , and power law + supernova ( pl+sn ) scenarios .",
    "the magnitudes for the host galaxy are the weighted means of the magnitudes that we obtained from the danish 1.54-m and eso 3.6-m telescopes , and the _ hst_. allowing for small systematic uncertainties , the observed magnitudes and colors for the host and oa are consistent with the predictions of the pure power - law model , which indicates that the oa followed a slow power - law decay with a constant index of @xmath4 , with no significant late - time break towards steeper decay . our results are inconsistent with the presence of a sn like sn1998bw .",
    "the discrepancy between the observations and the predictions of the pl+sn scenario suggests that a sn in the late - time light curve of grb  990712 would have had to be @xmath5 mag fainter than sn1998bw to be consistent with the data presented in this _",
    "letter_. therefore , we conclude that either grb  990712 did not produce a sn , or that the flux received from the sn was much smaller than expected from scaling sn1998bw to @xmath23 .",
    "if there was no sn then this supports the view that long - duration grbs have more than one type of progenitor @xcite .",
    "grb  970508 is the only other grb for which there is some evidence that a sn was _ not _ present .",
    "however , the paucity of observations around the time of the predicted peak luminosity of the sn makes it difficult to unambiguously rule out a sn contribution in grb  970508 s light curve .",
    "therefore , grb  990712 provides the first solid evidence that not all long - duration grbs are associated with standard - candle sne .",
    "there are some similarities between grb  990712 and grb  970508 that suggest that they may be members of the same class of bursts .",
    "both had shallow late - time decay slopes ( @xmath4 ) , both appear to lack a 1998bw - type sn , both bursts were strong @xmath10-ray sources , and both bursts have host galaxies that are significantly fainter than @xmath162 .",
    "if there was a sn associated with grb  990712 , then its peak intensity was @xmath5 mag fainter than that of sn1998bw .",
    "type ib / c sne are poor standard candles since their predicted peak intensities can vary by 12 mag , with a mean peak @xmath108-band magnitude that is 1.16 mag fainter than that of sn1998bw @xcite . moreover , the predicted peak magnitude for a sn associated with grb  990712 depends on the cosmological model , the exact spectral shape of sn1998bw at very short wavelengths , the width of the lightcurve peak , the possible extinction in the host galaxy , and the possible evolution of sne with redshift . a large sample of grb afterglows with measured redshifts and detectable sn signatures is needed to establish the intrinsic luminosity distribution of sne accompanying grbs .",
