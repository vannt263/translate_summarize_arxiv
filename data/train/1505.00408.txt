    "often their inter - particle potential is long - range and similar to the coulomb one .",
    "usually , this kind of potentials cause divergences ( that s why they are often called `` catastrophic '' ) and complicates consideration @xcite . on the other hand , mentioned systems are very interesting due to their application to the studies of a variety of peculiar phenomena in different fields of science @xcite .",
    "it seems to be the most challenging problem to treat coulomb - like systems with high concentrations of interacting particles @xcite .",

    "it is rather difficult , since traditional methods of statistical mechanics can not be applied to systems with coulomb - like interactions because of free - energy divergences .",
    "moreover , partition function can be exactly evaluated only for few model systems of interacting particles in the thermodynamical limit @xcite .",
    "thus , basing on @xcite , we will use alternative approach that employs hubbard - stratonovich representation of the partition function @xcite . besides , we use approach involving probability distribution function for the whole lattice as in @xcite , but construct it from single - particle distribution functions with a special procedure .",

    "it is very useful to notice , that this is the only summand that approaches infinity if @xmath98 .",
    "this means that can be used for different lattice comparison even without screening .",
    "we will only need to measure energy starting from @xmath99 as `` ground - level '' .",
    "one more thing to notice .",
    "coulomb is a long - range interaction and localization distance @xmath3 should not play any significant role in approximation .",
    "here we see that it is really absent .",
    "rather different may be a picture for short - range interactions or effective interactions with uncompensated @xmath59 ( example  [ subsec : capillary_interaction ] ) .",
    "last example we will consider is a rough estimation of capillary interaction energy .",
    "this results will be used in section  [ sec : electrons_on_helium ] .",
    "more discussion on physics of the phenomenon and references we postpone until  [ sec : electrons_on_helium ] .",
    "it is known , that electrons deform liquid - helium surface when pressed against with electric field and this causes effective interaction with potential  @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is force caused by electric field , @xmath102 surface tension of liquid helium , @xmath103 distance between particles , @xmath104 modified bessel function , and @xmath105  @xcite capillary length that depends on the fluid properties only .    since we know that capillary interaction is essentially two - dimensional ( particles should be localized on some surface , no three - dimensional analogue ) we will use   with   and  . performing calculations ( appendix  [ subsec : appendix_capillary_v_k ] ) we get @xmath106 so we can immediately write @xmath107    for our purposes ( see section [ sec : electrons_on_helium ] ) a very rough approximation would be enough .",
    "so we use the same trick as in appendix [ subsec : approximation_f_int ] , but perform integration instead of summation and dealing with theta functions ( see appendix [ subsec : approximation_f_cap ] ) @xmath108    one should notice , that @xmath109 , so logarithm value is less then zero and thus whole expression is less then zero .",
    "it coincides with the fact that capillary interaction makes particles attract each other @xcite .",

    "allows to calculate energy of any lattice just inserting correct matrix @xmath73 and performing summation .",
    "but much more interesting is finding the lattice with minimal energy when particles density @xmath70 is fixed .",
    "obtained result can be verified experimentally .",
    "both sums in are highly convergent and this is very convenient for numeric calculations .",
    "thus we will limit summation with @xmath110 .",
    "this limit was found experimentally : taking more summands does not change calculated minimal lattice and free energy . on the other hand , taking less results in wrong lattice .",
    "and one more thing to mension .",
    "searching for lattice with minimal energy does not need calculation of full expression for @xmath84 .",
    "we need to minimize only parts with @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , they both contain @xmath111 , which means , that results of minimization do not depend of particle charge .",
    "minimization was performed with standard function findminimum of wolfram mathematica v.9 .",

    "performing this one may notice that @xmath116 cancel out in exponents and denominators .    before considering results ,",
    "one more remark should be done .",
    "mapping between set of all possible parameter values ( translation vectors ) and all possible bravais lattices is not a bijection .",
    "it is rather a surjection one lattice may be described with different sets of parameters ( different translation vectors ) . for minimization algorithms to be not confused",

    "upper figure shows different choice for second translation vector @xmath61 and @xmath117 . using reflections",
    "one may show that lattice on bottom figure is the same as on the upper one .",
    "so @xmath118 is possible choice as well .",
    "when performing numerical calculations additional restrictions are used to overcome this uncertainty . , width=226 ]    figure [ fig : lattice_uncertainty ] shows uncertainty when choosing parameters for lattice description for 2d case .",
    "one may see that it can be eliminated if we claim that projection of @xmath61 on @xmath60 is less then a half of @xmath60 . in terms of parameters",
    "this may be expressed as @xmath119    restrictions for 3d case are more sophisticated .",
    "but they may be achieved similarly as . actually should be kept for 3d as is .",
    "we only need to add analogous considerations for @xmath62 .",
    "first of all we introduce projection of vector @xmath62 on @xmath64 plane ( see figure  [ fig : vectors ] ) and take particles density into account ( substituting @xmath115 from  ) @xmath120 obviously this projection should fall into parallelogram constructed on @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this condition is an obvious extension of two - dimensional case to third dimension .",

    "particle from layer above @xmath64 plane is shown with circle and below the plane with filled circle .",
    "particles in @xmath64 plane are not explicitly shown .",
    "if particle from above the plane is projected into the upper half of @xmath121 parallelogram a reflection with respect to @xmath64 plane can be used to get representation where this particle is in lower half of parallelogram .",

    "we get following conditions @xmath122    now we can present results of numerical minimization in form of figure  [ figure_hcp ] and following table .",
    "looking at figure  [ figure_hcp ] , one my see , it is very similar to hexagonal close packing ( hcp ) lattice .",
    "hcp consists of two interleaving planes with triangular 2-d lattice in each as well .",
    "so we may check , if this is really hcp lattice by comparing their parameters .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     results show that lattice obtained by numerical calculations is really hcp .",
    "this complies with experimental data and computer simulation @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider electrons on the liquid helium surface , calculate localization distance and compare it to obtained in other works .    in the presence of an external field electrons",
    "can be pressed against the helium surface with significant force .",
    "but they can not go through this surface , because quantum effects push them out @xcite .",
    "thus they deform surface and this deformation , in its turn , changes interaction potential between electrons .",
    "the problem of finding explicit expression of this potential is solved by adding to coulomb interaction effective capillary interaction .",
    "the lateral for two electrons on the helium surface was calculated in  @xcite .",
    "we aim to find localization distance for electrons on the liquid helium surface . to achieve this goal",
    "we will minimize single - particle s free energy @xmath74 over @xmath3 ( localization distance , see example [ subsec : two_dim_fermi ] ) .",
    "so first of all we construct @xmath74 and find @xmath123 .    in section [ sec : stat_descr ] we developed a method for treating some quantum systems .",
    "example [ subsec : two_dim_fermi ] shows how to use it for two - dimensional system of fermi - particles .",

    "potential energy is more complicated . in section [ sec : lattice ]",
    "we developed methods for its calculation .",
    "there are two parts of potential energy for electrons on the liquid helium surface @xcite : coulomb interaction and capillary interaction . for coulomb interaction we can find a shortcut it was shown in @xcite that this part approximately does not depend on localization distance @xmath3 .",
    "besides , one may think on approximate expression for coulomb interaction from example [ subsec : coulomb_potential ] .",
    "it does not contain @xmath3 , and the same behavior we may expect from coulomb interaction for 2d lattice . since we are interested in derivative @xmath123 , consideration of this part of potential energy may be omitted .",
    "more interesting is capillary interaction presented in example [ subsec : capillary_interaction ] , approximation .",
    "it contains explicit dependence on @xmath3 and thus should be taken into account .",
    "bringing it all together we get @xmath124 independently on lattice we are considering .    substituting electron charge @xmath125 and solving equation @xmath126 we get @xmath127 if temperature tends to be small @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath128 ) @xmath129 this result does not differ from the classical one presented in  @xcite .",
    "if we consider more carefully , some interesting result may be obtained .",
    "let s consider low densities so that any value of @xmath3 may be treated as much lower than interelectron distance @xmath116 .",
    "then we may notice that solution for @xmath3 exists if @xmath130    last equation means that there is no lattice if temperature @xmath131 is too high , or if field @xmath132 is too weak .",
    "this statement is in agreement with our physical intuition .",
    "in conclusion we want to make some overview of results we have obtained .    in * section  [ sec : stat_descr ] * we started with a statistical description of inhomogeneous system of interacting particles .",
    "it was shown that variety of quantum systems may be described with no much difference from classical ones .",
    "we found an expression for free energy .",
    "the main feature of this equation appeares in expression for `` entropy part '' of free energy .",
    "obtained result is applicable to a wide variety of systems with different number of dimensions .    to make a step aside from pure theory we considered an example  [ subsec : two_dim_fermi ] of two - dimensional system of fermi particles .",

    "one may notice that for any `` catastrophic '' potential there is only one diverging term .",
    "but this term does not contain information on `` lattice geometry '' , it depends on mean particle density only .",
    "this means , we can compare two lattices with equal mean particle density even if inter - particle potential is `` catastrophic '' .    in this approach",
    "all potentials are classified into two groups : ones with self - interaction ( often effective interactions through medium ) and without .",
    "examples [ subsec : coulomb_potential ] and [ subsec : capillary_interaction ] demonstrate how to use proposed technique in both cases .",
    "later they are reused for treating grains in dusty plasma ( section  [ sec : dust_crystal ] ) and electrons on the liquid - helium surface ( section  [ sec : electrons_on_helium ] ) .    in * section  [ sec : dust_crystal ]",
    "* we considered grains in dusty plasma .",
