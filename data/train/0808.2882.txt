    "in 2006 , the superfluid state was realized in a @xmath3li fermi gas loaded on an optical lattice@xcite . in the optical lattice ,",
    "atoms feel a periodic potential produced by standing wave of laser light@xcite .",
    "thus , together with a tunable pairing interaction associated with a feshbach resonance@xcite , we can now study lattice effects on fermi superfluids in the bcs - bec crossover region .",
    "since fermi gases in optical lattices are similar to conduction electrons in metals , superfluid lattice fermi gases may be also useful for the study of metallic superconductivity .",
    "various effects of optical lattice on superfluid fermi gases have been studied theoretically@xcite . among them , one important effect is an anisotropic fermi surface .",
    "when the lattice potential is strong , the lattice fermi gas is expected to be close to the hubbard model , consisting of nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath4 and on - site pairing interaction @xmath5 . in this case , the fermi surface in the cubic lattice has the nesting property at the half - filling , characterized by the nesting vector @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 is the lattice constant .",
    "this perfect nesting induces strong density wave fluctuations , the strength of which is comparable to pairing fluctuations@xcite . as a result , the coexistence of superfluid state and density wave state is realized in the half - filling case@xcite .",
    "since the competition between these two kinds of fluctuations is absent in a uniform fermi superfluid , this coexistence phenomenon is characteristic of lattice fermi superfluids .",
    "we note that the anisotropic fermi surface has been recently observed in a @xmath8k lattice fermi gas@xcite .    besides this",
    ", kinetic properties of bound pairs ( cooper pairs ) are also strongly affected by optical lattice potential . in the strong coupling regime of the hubbard model",
    ", it has been shown that the hopping of a bound pair between lattice sites is accompanied by virtual dissociation@xcite .",
    "this comes from the fact that the ordinary hubbard model consists of the _ atomic _ hopping and on - site interaction .",
    "namely , when the bound pair moves between lattice sites , each atom in this molecule has to move one by one .",
    "this tunneling process naturally leads to the enhancement of molecular band mass in the strong coupling regime as @xmath9@xcite , where @xmath10 is the molecular binding energy .",
    "since @xmath10 diverges in the strong coupling limit , the molecular mass @xmath0 also diverges , leading to the vanishing superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath1@xcite .",
    "we note that the molecular mass equals twice the atomic mass in the strong coupling regime of a _ uniform _ fermi superfluid with no optical lattice , leading to the finite value of @xmath11@xcite ( where @xmath12 is the fermi temperature ) .",
    "the hubbard model is usually expected to be valid for the optical lattice system when the lattice potential is strong . however , orso and co - workers@xcite recently studied a bound state problem in a realistic cosine - shape optical lattice potential , and showed that the molecular band mass @xmath0 actually does not diverge but remains finite even in the strong coupling limit .",
    "their result indicates that the hubbard model is _ not _ valid at least for the strong coupling limit of optical lattice system .",
    "thus , it is an interesting problem whether or not the molecular tunneling accompanied by dissociation predicted in the hubbard model is really realized in a superfluid fermi gas loaded on an optical lattice .",
    "this is also related to the problem about the validity of the hubbard model for superfluid fermi gases loaded on optical lattices .    in this paper , we investigate a bound pair of fermi atoms in an optical lattice . including a cosine - shape periodic potential , we calculate molecular wavefunction .",
    "we show how the spatial structure of the bound pair changes during the tunneling through the lattice potential .",
    "we also compare molecular kinetic properties in the optical lattice potential with results in an attractive fermi hubbard model , in order to examine the validity of the hubbard model for superfluid fermi gases in optical lattices .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated tunneling properties of a bound pair of fermi atoms in an optical lattice . including a realistic one - dimensional cosine - shape periodic potential , we have calculated the molecular wavefunction , binding energy , excitation spectrum , and band mass .",
    "we have also discussed validity of the hubbard model for superfluid fermi gases in optical lattices .    in the strong coupling regime of the hubbard model , the molecular tunneling through the lattice potential is accompanied by virtual dissociation into two atoms .",
    "this tunneling phenomenon does not actually occur in the strong coupling regime of real optical lattice system , where the bound pair moves in the lattice potential without dissociation .",
    "however , in the intermediate coupling regime , spatial structure of the molecular wavefunction indicates that the molecule dissociates into two atoms when the center of mass position is located at the top of the lattice potential .",
    "our results show that the tunneling mechanism accompanied by virtual dissociation is realized in the optical lattice system , not in the strong coupling regime , but in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "we have also examined the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath1 in the strong coupling bec limit , where the simple fermi hubbard model is no longer valid . including the correct molecular tunneling process in this limit",
    ", we showed that @xmath1 is finite but is still low compared with the maximum @xmath1 obtained in the intermediate coupling regime of the hubbard model .",
    "so far , the bcs - bec crossover in a lattice fermi gas has been mainly examined based on the hubbard model consisting of the atomic hopping and on - site pairing interaction .",
    "since this model gives vanishing @xmath1 in the strong coupling limit , the observation of a finite and constant @xmath1 in the bec regime of a lattice fermi gas would be an evidence of the pair tunneling without dissociation .",
    "although @xmath1 in this regime is expected to be low , the observation of the finite @xmath1 in the bec regime is an important challenge to clarify the validity of the hubbard model in considering the bcs - bec crossover regime of lattice fermi gases .",
    "we also note that the molecular tunneling with virtual dissociation enhances the molecular mass .",
    "this naturally leads to the suppression of @xmath1 in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "thus , the observation of the decrease of @xmath1 in the intermediate coupling regime would be an indirect evidence of the virtual dissociation of the bound pair during the tunneling through the lattice potential .",
    "since the superfluid fermi gas in an optical lattice is an important many - body system in both cold atom physics and condensed matter physics , we expect that our results would be useful for the study of basic properties of this interesting system .",
    "this work was supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research from mext , and ctc program of japan .",
    "in the superfluid phase , we take @xmath194 in eq . ( [ eq.5.1 ] ) , where @xmath195 is the bec order parameter . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "ignoring the fluctuation term having the form @xmath196 , we find that eq .",
