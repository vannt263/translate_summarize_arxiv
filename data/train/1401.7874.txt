    "in a laser wakefield accelerator ( lwfa ) a single laser pulse , with a peak intensity of order @xmath2{w cm^{-2}}$ ] , propagates through a plasma and excites a density wave via the ponderomotive force , which acts to expel plasma electrons from the region of the laser pulse .",
    "as described in recent reviews,@xcite the electric fields developed within the plasma wave are of the order of @xmath3{gv m^{-1}}$ ]  some three orders of magnitude greater than possible with a conventional accelerator .    in mp - lwfa a train of low - energy laser pulses , rather than a single high - energy pulse ,",
    "is used to excite the plasma wave .",
    "the plasma wakefields excited by the pulses will add coherently  so that the amplitude of the wakefield increases with each additional pulse  if the pulses are spaced by the plasma period @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the mean electron density .",
    "excitation of a plasma wakefield by single and multiple laser pulses is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : concepts ] .",
    "we note that driving a wakefield with a train of @xmath7 pulses has several potential advantages over lwfa .",
    "first , the driving laser energy is spread over the duration of the pulse train , reducing by a factor of @xmath7 the peak laser intensity to which the optical components are exposed .",
    "importantly , the reduced intensity would enable the use of an optic of small - diameter @xmath8 and short focal length @xmath9 to couple the pulse train into the plasma ; this would considerably reduce the space required for staged plasma accelerators@xcite and potentially avoid the need for plasma mirrors .",
    "second , mp - lwfa offers scope for additional control by adjusting the spacing , centre frequency , energy , and duration of the pulses in the train ; this flexibility is likely to be important for developing advanced plasma accelerators which are optimized for efficiency , which are stable against longitudinal variations of the plasma density@xcite and/or which exploit longitudinal tapering to achieve acceleration beyond the dephasing length.@xcite third , it has been shown that large amplitude ( nonlinear ) wakefields can be excited more efficiently , and with reduced plasma instabilities , by a train of pulses than with a single pulse of the same total energy.@xcite      in order to develop a more quantitative understanding of the operation of a mp - lwfa we have investigated the plasma wave that could be driven by a pulse train with parameters similar to that which could be produced by a state - of - the - art , high - repetition fibre laser system , as described below .",
    "our calculations were performed using weakly relativistic electron fluid equations @xcite and the particle - in - cell code osiris.@xcite each laser pulse in the train was assumed to have an energy of , a pulse duration of @xmath10{fs}$ ] , and a centre wavelength of @xmath11{\\mu m}$ ] ; the pulses were taken to be focused to a spot size of @xmath12{\\mu m}$ ] , corresponding to a peak normalized vector potential of @xmath13 and spaced by the plasma period .",
    "calculations were performed for a plasma density of @xmath14{cm^{-3}}$ ] , which maximises the electron energy gain produced by this pulse train .     within the plasma wave as a function of the number of pulses in the pulse train described in the main text .",
    "the solid black line shows the results of fluid simulations , and the results of pic simulations are shown for the case of stationary ( blue ) and mobile ( red ) xe@xmath15 ions , and for mobile hydrogen ions ( grey ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : fluid_sims ] shows the growth predicted by fluid simulations of the maximum axial accelerating field @xmath16 as a function of the number of the pulse within the train ; it can be seen that @xmath16 grows linearly .",
    "the amplitude of the plasma density wave ( not shown ) grows in similar way and reaches a relative value of @xmath17 on axis .",
    "this corresponds to only a mildly nonlinear wakefield and hence there was no need to adjust the spacing between laser pulses to counter relativistic detuning .",
    "our fluid simulations do not include ion motion , which is expected to be significant for pulse trains with a total duration which is not short compared to the ion plasma period @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "to understand the effect of ion motion we performed pic simulations for neutral plasmas comprising electrons and : ( i ) pre - ionized hydrogen ions ; ( ii ) immobile pre - ionized xe@xmath15 ions ; and ( iii ) mobile pre - ionized xe@xmath15 ions .",
    "the pic simulations of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluid_sims ] show that ion motion will indeed limit the total number of pulses which can usefully be used in a mp - lwfa . for the chosen parameters the useful number of pulses is @xmath20 , at which point the plasma wave accelerating field has reached @xmath21{gv / m}$ ] . for an accelerator with a length equal to half the dephasing length , @xmath22{mm}$ ]  corresponding to acceleration in the accelerating _ and _ focusing phases of the plasma wave  the energy gain is @xmath23{gev}$ ] .",
    "state - of - the - art femtosecond solid - state lasers used for particle acceleration are joule - class titanium - sapphire chirped - pulse amplification ( cpa ) systems .",
    "@xcite lasers of this type can easily generate the high peak intensities required for driving plasma accelerators , but they can only operate at a relatively low average power due to their poor thermo - optical properties and low efficiency ( typically much less than 1% ) .",
    "in contrast , innovative diode - pumped solid - state lasers such as slab , thin - disc and fibre lasers are able to provide ultra - short laser pulses with _ average _",
    "power@xcite above , but _",
    "powers of only a few gw .        recently , it has been proposed that the demanding requirements of lwfas operating at high @xmath0 could be met by coherently combining the output of many lasers.@xcite this approach involves spatially separated amplification of the pulses , which distributes the challenges imposed on the laser gain medium from one emitter to many and , in effect , operates as an amplifying interferometer .",
    "this scheme has been extensively investigated using optical fibres as the gain media , and performance beyond that possible from a single fibre amplifier has been demonstrated.@xcite this idea can be further extended into the temporal domain by splitting each pulse into a short train , which is amplified and then temporally recombined into a single high - energy pulse  an approach known as divided - pulse - amplification ( dpa).@xcite it is anticipated that a combination of spatial and temporal multiplexing will allow the production of joule - level pulses with @xmath0 in the khz range .",
    "multi - pulse lwfas could be driven by a related approach , but with the additional requirement of the generation of a train of 100 - 200 pulses .",
    "pulse trains can be generated using beam splitters and delay lines,@xcite or by employing spectral - shaping ; however , these methods typically introduce losses exceeding 50% , or have challenging alignment requirements . here",
    "we outline one method for generating a pulse train suitable for mp - lwfa based on interference of two spectrally - separated pulses in a variation of the well - known plasma beat - wave accelerator.@xcite in this approach broadband pulses are amplified in two cpa systems and partially compressed to the duration required of the entire pulse train . if the pulses have a constant angular frequency difference @xmath24 , then when combined the temporal profile will correspond to that of the stretched pulses modulated by a cosine - squared function of period @xmath25 .",
    "we note that it may also be possible to generate a train of pulses with optimized parameters by phase - only filtering ; this is compatible with cpa since it maintains a broad - band spectrum with minimal amplitude modulation.@xcite    figure [ fig : laser_design ] shows a conceptual design of a table - top laser system suitable for driving a mp - lwfa .",
    "pulses from a femtosecond oscillator are separated into two spectral branches with centre wavelengths of and .",
    "each spectral branch is amplified as follows : the pulse is stretched to a few nanoseconds duration ; the repetition rate is reduced to and the pulse is pre - amplified ; the pulse is then amplified in a 16-amplifier dpa scheme in which the pulse is split into a train of 8 replicas ; following temporal recombination , the pulse is partially recompressed .",
    "the two spectral branches are then combined to form the mp - lwfa pulse train of @xmath26 , , pulses at @xmath27{khz}$ ] .",
    "an important feature of this approach is that it is possible to manipulate the spectral phases of the two stretched pulses so that the two spectral branches , when partially compressed , have a non - constant angular frequency difference @xmath28 . combining these branches will then generate a pulse train with controllable , non - uniform pulse spacing .",
    "the additional control enabled by phase manipulation of two spectrally - broad spectral branches will allow resonance to be maintained for nonlinear plasma wake - fields , as discussed by previous authors.@xcite it also offers scope for achieving auto - resonance by down - sweeping the beat frequency across the local plasma frequency , as discussed by lindberg et al.;@xcite this could provide stability against variations in the local plasma density , or allow mp - lwfas to achieve acceleration beyond the de - phasing length by employing tapered plasmas.@xcite",
    "the high pulse repetition rate which could be achieved with mp - lwfas would make them ideal drivers of femtosecond radiation sources providing high mean photon flux as well as exceptionally high peak brightness .",
    "here we consider radiation generation in undulators and from the betatron motion of the transverse oscillation of the electrons as they accelerate in the plasma wakefield .",
    "we note that radiation generated by other methods , such as thomson and compton scattering , @xcite would also benefit from the high values of @xmath0 enabled by mp - lwfa . in the calculations below we assume electron beam parameters consistent with existing lwfa performance@xcite and the fluid and pic simulations given above : an electron energy of ; 1% relative energy spread ; a bunch charge of ; a normalized transverse emittance of @xmath29{\\mu m}$ ] , and a gaussian temporal profile of fwhm .",
    "as outlined in the methods section , the radiation generated by betatron motion within the mp - lwfa can be estimated using standard theory,@xcite noting that for the parameters we have considered the mp - lwfa will not operate in the `` blow - out '' regime as is usually assumed .",
    "for efficient betatron radiation production it will be necessary to operate closer to the non - linear regime which can be achieved by using tighter focusing or higher plasma densities .",
    "figure [ fig : radiation]a ) shows the calculated average flux of a mp - lwfa - driven betatron source operating at @xmath27{khz}$ ] . for these calculations",
    "the betatron oscillation amplitude was assumed to be @xmath30{\\mu m}$ ] and the laser focal spot size was decreased to @xmath31{\\mu m}$ ] to ensure a stronger wake , which was calculated by the fluid code . at a photon energy of we",
    "find that the _ average _ flux is @xmath32{photons\\,s^{-1},per\\,0.1 \\%\\,bandwidth}$ ] . this average flux is greater than existing beam lines on 3rd generation synchrotron light sources used for sub - picoseond time resolved studies , and with a significantly improved temporal resolution ( compared with @xmath33{ps}$ ] ) .",
    "we note that using a still smaller laser spot size would increase the amplitude of the betatron motion , and hence the output photon flux ; optimizing the laser - plasma parameters for betatron emission will be the focus of further study .",
    "the mp - lwfa beam can be used to drive spontaneous undulator radiation with high average brightness and ultra short pulse duration .",
    "more interestingly , the mp - lwfa could be coupled with advanced accelerator transport techniques and undulator technology which are able to accommodate the relatively large energy spread generated by lwfas ; as suggested recently , these techniques include transverse gradient undulators ( tgu ) or bunch decompression.@xcite    in a tgu the magnetic field of the undulator varies with transverse position . if the beam transport system is arranged",
    "so that each energy component of the electron beam enters the undulator at a different transverse point then it is possible to match the fel resonance condition over the entire transverse dimension ( and hence energy spectrum ) of the electron beam by matching the dispersion function at the entrance of the undulator to the tgu field gradient .",
    "figure [ fig : radiation](b ) shows the results of a full 3d time - dependent simulation with the code@xcite genesis of the peak power of the fel radiation generated by the mp - lwfa beam in a tgu with the undulator and electron beam parameters reported in table [ tab : undulator_parameters ] .",
    "these show that sase saturation can be reached in the soft x - ray range ( @xmath34{nm}$ ] ) within a long undulator , yielding a peak power exceeding .",
    "this is a factor 20 larger than the power obtained from a planar undulator with the same electron beam .",
    "harmonics of @xmath35 can also be generated , albeit at significantly reduced power .",
    "the proposed fel scheme holds the promise of generating femtosecond x - ray pulses of gw peak power at khz pulse repetition rates , driven by  and therefore synchronised to  a compact femtosecond visible laser system .",

    "the advantages of mp - lwfa  such as the potential for high - repetition rate operation and the use of small diameter optics whilst avoiding optical damage  have been highlighted above .",
    "here we briefly discuss some potential issues arising from driving plasma accelerators with a train of laser pulses , before some concluding remarks .",
    "a wakefield driven by a single ( laser or particle ) pulse can be subject to a deleterious transverse , or ` hosing ' , motion when the tail of the driver is not centred transversely in the wake driven by its head.@xcite similar behaviour could also occur in a mp - lwfa if there is a transverse offset between pulses in the train .",
    "we have developed an analytical model@xcite of hosing in mp - lwfa which shows that , in the absence of a guiding structure , a single off - axis pulse trailing an on - axis pulse will oscillate transversely with an angular frequency @xmath39 which depends on the longitudinal separation of the two pulses and the strength of the wakefield driven by the leading pulse .",
    "the oscillation is found to be stable if the longitudinal pulse separation is @xmath40 with @xmath41^{-1}$ ] , i.e.  if the pulses are separated by slightly less than @xmath42 .",
    "further , the hosing can be stabilized for @xmath43 by channelling the laser pulses in a waveguide with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the frequency that an off - axis pulse would oscillate in the waveguide in the absence of a plasma wave .",
    "these conclusions have been confirmed by numerical simulations , as will be reported elsewhere.@xcite    we envisage operating mp - lwfa in a linear or quasi - linear regime in which the laser pulses have a peak power below the critical power for relativistic self - focusing.@xcite this regime has advantages in that the driving laser pulses propagate without self - focusing , and with reduced spectral shifting and self - steepening ; however , it would be necessary to guide the laser pulses over the length of the accelerator using a hollow capillary waveguide@xcite or plasma channel.@xcite in this regime the wake amplitude in a mp - lwfa would be below the threshold for self - trapping;@xcite this brings a significant advantage in terms of zero dark current , but also means that some method for injecting electrons into the wakefield would be necessary .",
    "controlling electron injection will enable the generation of high - quality , stable electron bunches and for these reasons many techniques are being developed for plasma accelerators.@xcite    in conclusion mp - lwfa offers a route for enabling plasma accelerators operating at multi - khz pulse repetition rates to be driven by table - top laser systems with high wall - plug efficiency .",
    "novel plasma accelerators of this type would be ideal for driving compact coherent and incoherent radiation sources providing femtosecond thz to x - ray pulses which are intrinsically synchronized to the driving laser system .",
    "the temporal resolution achieved by mp - lwfa - driven incoherent light sources would be at least three orders of magnitude better than possible with extant 3rd generation sources , yet with comparable average photon flux . likewise mp - lwfas could drive fels with comparable peak power to operating fels , but at a significantly higher repetition rates .",
    "further developments  such as plasma accelerator staging  would allow generation of coherent radiation at shorter wavelengths than considered here .",
    "in the longer term the mp - lwfa could provide a stageable , efficient , and high - repetition rate structure capable of reaching beam energies of interest for particle colliders .",
