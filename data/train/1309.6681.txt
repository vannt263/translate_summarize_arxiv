    "one of the challenges of lattice qcd calculations is to determine the spectra of mesons and baryons .",
    "however , in the case of resonances the main difficulty is that they do not correspond to isolated energy levels in the spectrum of the qcd hamiltonian on the lattice . in the case of one or two channels ,",
    "the problem is formally solved under the framework of lscher  @xcite , which relates the measured discrete value of the energy in a finite volume to the scattering phase shift at the same energy , for the same system in the infinite volume .    in the last decade",
    ", two and three hadron systems have been studied extensively with unitary chiral models , @xmath2 , and dynamical generation of many baryon and meson resonances has been found @xcite .",
    "recently , the unitary chiral models have also been extended to investigate the interaction of two hadrons in a finite volume  @xcite . within this method",
    "it is possible to determine the energy levels of the system considered in a box and from there determine physical observables in infinite volume , providing in this way predictions and analyzing methods which can be very helpful for lattice qcd studies .    in the present case",
    "we study the @xmath3 system and coupled channels , in which the @xmath1 state is formed  @xcite , in a finite volume following the model developed in ref .  .",

    "we will also consider the case where the meson - baryon system moves with a four momentum @xmath21 in the box . in this case",
