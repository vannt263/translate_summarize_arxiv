    "colloidal suspensions provide valuable systems for the study of collective effects and phase transitions ( see e.g @xcite or more specifically @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recent advances in optical trapping techniques have enlarged the whole field and opened the possibility to obtain quasi two - dimensional systems , which can furthermore be subject to an external potential . a possibility to realize such external perturbations",
    "is through the interference of laser beams , the typically micron - sized colloids being attracted to the regions of highest intensity : for instance , unusual phases have been reported in the case of 1d troughs @xcite , such as floating solids or locked smectic phases @xcite .",
    "the situation of a two - dimensional periodic substrate , some instances of which can be realized by 3 laser beams , is remarkably rich and has been addressed experimentally @xcite , numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "the control parameters governing the static behaviour are numerous : filling fraction ( mean number of colloids per substrate minimum ) , pinning amplitude ( trap strength , increasing with laser intensity ) , temperature , and concerning the substrate geometry , lattice spacing and aspect ratio ( i.e rectangular unit cell instead of a square one ) .",
    "in addition , the colloids considered are highly charged objects , so that the debye length of the suspension , modified by changing the salt content , is a crucial parameter . in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the experimentally relevant ground state of those 2d systems , where the long range orientational order observed has been coined `` colloidal molecular crystal '' . if the external laser potential is strong enough , the colloids are irreversibly bound to the potential minima . in cases",
    "when more than one colloid is trapped in a single minimum we speak of a  colloidal molecule  .",
    "its size is determined by the interplay between light forces and interparticle repulsion .",
    "figure [ fig : example]-a ) provides an illustration of typical phases observed when the ratio of the total number of colloids in the system to the total number of external potential minima is exactly two . whereas defects are present at finite temperature , we observe that the ground state is free of such objects , so that each trap captures exactly two colloids .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "the first goal is to provide a thorough numerical investigation of orientational ordering in colloidal molecular crystals on two - dimensional periodic substrates",
    ". we will focus on stoichiometries 2 and 3 , where dimers and trimers are formed , respectively , with the underlying square or triangular symmetry for the potential .",
    "we will also address the situations where the corresponding lattice unit cell is distorted by changing the aspect ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the second objective is to critically test several assumptions that led to the theoretical frameworks used in refs .",
    "@xcite to study such problems . in section [ sec : rigid ] , we will start with an approach , common to refs @xcite , where the composite objects ( @xmath1-mers ) formed in each trap are considered as rigid entities with an orientational degree of freedom only , while the confining potential is taken into account implicitly .",
    "this allows for a significant reduction of the complexity of the problem .",
    "reference phase behaviour is thus obtained , which will be tested against more realistic simulations in section [ sec : flexible ] , where each colloid is resolved and the confining potential explicitly accounted for .",
    "finally , we will also test the relevance of the various effective potentials used in @xcite to construct a tractable hamiltonian allowing for analytical progress .",

    "this binding energy is of several @xmath90 at large @xmath25 , while it is very small at small @xmath25 , in the @xmath88 regime @xcite .",
    "the assumption of discrete angles therefore fails at large @xmath25 ( weak light potentials ) and leads to the correct results only at small @xmath25 , where , however , due to the shallow binding in the angular direction , there is no _ a - priori _ reason to justify it but for ground state properties .",
    "the parameter regime of the experiments @xcite is marked as a shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : angles](a )",
    ". interestingly , the experimental situation is somewhat intermediate between both limiting regimes and neither of the approaches seems to be perfectly appropriate .",
    "however , other realizations of the light confinement are possible , like creating isotropic optical point traps instead of using the interference patterns as in @xcite .",
    "for such an experiment , the present approach  the lower curve in fig.[fig : angles](a ) , corresponding to the isotropic trap  would be relevant .",
    "finally , we also note that numerical simulations of colloidal molecules in the anisotropic light confinement ( [ anisov ] ) have been performed in @xcite .",
    "the parameters studied there ( @xmath99 ) are nevertheless quite distant from those of the experiments @xcite where @xmath100 . in an aqueous solution ,",
    "@xmath101 can not be achieved with 3 @xmath102 size colloids as used in @xcite , since the inverse debye length @xmath103 is bounded from below by the solvent dissociation . moreover , in the regime @xmath104 , the pair - wise additivity assumption leading to the yukawa potential is questionable , and many - body effects could play an important role .",
    "we have provided a numerical analysis of the type of long range orientational orders selected in so - called colloidal molecular crystals , where a given integer number @xmath1 of colloids is trapped in each potential minimum of a light lattice .",
    "we investigated the cases of dimers ( @xmath28 ) and trimers ( @xmath105 ) on both square and triangular lattices , together with deformed geometries obtained when a given direction of the original lattice is expanded or shrunk by a factor @xmath0 .",
    "the sequence of phases reported is rich . for triangular lattices mostly , and although we were only interested in the lowest energy configuration , we have uncovered the relevance of the flexibility of the @xmath1-mers in a given trap , whereas previous approaches envisioned those composite objects as a rigid entity . in most cases ,",
    "the qualitative predictions derived within the rigid picture appear qualitatively correct though .",
    "we have also addressed the adequacy of truncating interactions to colloids located in nearest neighbour traps , and found that in some cases , the quasi degeneracy between states of different orientational orders makes second nearest neighbours and possibly more remote shells relevant .",
    "we emphasise that the pinning potential we considered is of isotropic form , and therefore does not favour any orientation of the trapped @xmath1-mers . on the other hand",
    ", it was assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the pinning potential itself leads to a discrete set of possible orientations , which were supposed to match the lattice symmetry .",
    "in particular , such an assumption would only be compatible with the ferromagnetic @xmath2 and antiferromagnetic @xmath13 phases for dimers on the square lattice .",
    "our investigation shows that several other tilted phases exist , with an angular selection due to coulombic repulsive interaction alone . instead of a discrete set of predefined angles",
    "we find that the angular coordinates change continuously with parameters .",
    "we have explored in detail the limits of validity of both assumptions and have concluded that working with discrete angles can only be justified if the light confinement is very strong or when colloids repel weakly .",
    "we have shown however that the angular confinement is very weak in this regime .",

    "while colloidal positional degrees of freedom are limited to a 2d plane , microions and solvent molecule are not subject to confinement , which results in a traditional three - dimensional - like screened coulomb interaction between macroions",
    ".    strictly speaking , expression ( [ eq : yukawa ] ) is not an energy but a free energy since it includes an entropic contribution from the microions ; we also stress that the ground state we consider are reached at constant @xmath103 while the latter is a temperature dependent quantity ; this is in line with the numerical approach of @xcite , and relevant to experiments where the aforementioned ground state may be approached by tuning the pinning amplitude at constant temperature .",
