    "in the last couple of years , gas - like states comprised of @xmath0 clusters in atomic nuclei have attracted increased interest @xcite .",
    "it is basically considered that all of the @xmath0-clusters in such states occupy the same @xmath4-orbital , which has a spatially extended distribution @xcite .",
    "this situation is well expressed by introducing the so - called thsr ( tohsaki horiuchi schuck rpke ) wave function , where the oscillator parameter is large , which is completely different from the normal @xmath4-orbital for each nucleon .",
    "the most plausible candidates for such gas - like states of @xmath0 clusters are the second @xmath5 state of @xmath6c@xmath7 ( 3@xmath0 ) at @xmath8 mev and more generally , states around the @xmath9-threshold energies .",
    "the squared overlap between the wave function of a microscopic cluster model and the thsr wave function has been found to be more than 90@xmath10 for @xmath6c @xcite , which suggests that the single thsr wave function is a good approximation for the description of the gas - like state .",
    "furthermore , a candidate for the gas - like state of 4@xmath0 clusters around the threshold energy in @xmath1o has been studied by both theoretical and experimental approaches @xcite .    lately , the research into gas - like states comprised of @xmath0 clusters moved onto the second stage .",
    "for instance , the possibility of gas - like states of @xmath0 clusters around a core in heavier nuclei has been suggested @xcite .",
    "the coherent emission of @xmath0 clusters from the compound nucleus in heavier nuclei has been reported @xcite , which leads us to a hypothesis that gas - like states of @xmath0 clusters can be formed not only in @xmath6c and @xmath1o but also in heavier nuclei with some core . using the @xmath11si+@xmath2 mg reaction ,",
    "the compound states of @xmath12fe have been populated , and the @xmath13be(@xmath14 ) and @xmath6c(@xmath15 ) emissions from these states have been observed , which are much enhanced compared to the sequential @xmath0-emission . from a statistical model point of view , it is natural to consider that the emitted second @xmath5 state of @xmath6c is formed inside the coulomb barrier of the compound nucleus .",
    "the enhancement of the emission of the gas - like states of @xmath0 clusters could be due to the lowering of the effective coulomb barrier for the condensed states @xcite , since the kinetic energy of the emitted @xmath6c in coincidence with @xmath16-emission has been observed to be much smaller than the energy sum of three @xmath0 s in the sequential 3@xmath0 emission .    to study the possibility of gas - like states of @xmath0 clusters in heavier nuclei from the theoretical side , we have introduced a monte carlo technique for the description of the thsr wave function , which is called the ",
    "virtual thsr \" wave function @xcite .",
    "we have shown the possibility of a three @xmath0 state around a @xmath17ca core @xcite .",
    "the three @xmath0 cluster state around @xmath17ca has an energy below the coulomb barrier top energy with a spatial extension comparable to the second @xmath5 state of @xmath6c .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the strong enhancement of isoscalar monopole ( e0 ) transitions can be a measure of the existence of cluster structure @xcite .",
    "for instance , the presence of cluster states in @xmath18c has been suggested by measuring the isoscalar e0 transitions from the ground @xmath19 state induced by the @xmath18c@xmath20c reaction @xcite .",
    "the obtained cross - sections are much larger than those of the shell - model calculations .",
    "the result suggests that protons and neutrons are coherently excited and that they have spatially extended distribution in the excited states . from the theoretical side ,",
    "the relation between the monopole transition strength and the cluster structure has also been discussed @xcite .",
    "the basic idea arises from the bayman - bohr theorem @xcite , which shows that the lowest representation of the shell - model contains a component of the lowest @xmath21 representation of the cluster states and the monopole operator connects the lowest @xmath21 state and the well - developed cluster states .",
    "the experimental search for the large monopole strength to gas - like cluster state(s ) of @xmath0 clusters around an @xmath1o core is on going , and we analyze such structure from the theoretical point of view . in this paper",
    "we study the gas - like state of two @xmath0 clusters around an @xmath1o core in @xmath2 mg , and here , the coupling effect between the gas - like @xmath0 cluster state and the normal cluster states in the low - lying region is taken into account .",

    "the center of mass of each basis state @xmath41 is shifted to the origin after generating the wave functions of @xmath0 clusters around @xmath1o .",

    "we use the following volkov no.2 effective @xmath60 potential @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 : majorana exchange parameter ) .",
    "it is known that although @xmath63 @xmath64 0.6 reproduces the @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering phase shift , larger @xmath63 values are needed for the structure calculation beyond @xmath6c , and here @xmath63 is chosen to be 0.63 to yield a reasonable binding energy of @xmath2 mg . using the present interaction , the lowest state of @xmath1o+2@xmath0 ( @xmath2 mg )",
