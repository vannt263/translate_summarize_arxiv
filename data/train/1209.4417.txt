    "the metal - insulator and the superconductor - insulator transitions ( mit and sit respectively ) are two major representatives of quantum phase transitions that have been extensively studied over the last decades .",
    "disorder driven mit @xcite could be affected by a number of means ; doping , pressure , stress , etc .",
    "@xcite . a unique method to drive the system from the insulating to the metallic ( or superconducting ) state is feasible in some metallic glasses prepared from the gaseous phase .",
    "amorphous films quench - condensed onto substrates by vacuum deposition usually contain micro - voids and have a lower mass - density than the respective equilibrium material @xcite and thus , on average , smaller interatomic overlap .",
    "thermal treatment at pre - crystallization temperatures may then be used to reduce the free volume created by the micro - voids @xcite . in this method one",
    "controls the inter - atomic overlap in a similar vein as in employing hydrostatic pressure on a solid .",
    "the main difference is that thermal annealing inevitably causes an irreversible volume change .",
    "thermal annealing has been employed to change the resistivity of amorphous indium - oxide films while monitoring their optical properties @xcite .",
    "typically , 3 - 5 orders of magnitude in room temperature resistivity could be obtained accompanying a @xmath23% reduction in sample thickness ( measured by x - ray interferometry @xcite ) , which is a much larger volume change than is commonly achievable by hydrostatic pressure . using this technique , the sit in a three - dimensional indium - oxide films",
    "was mapped by measuring the low temperature conductivity as function of disorder @xcite .",
    "the amorphous indium - oxide had electron density of @xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 and the samples static disorder was characterized by @xmath0 ( defined in section ii ) . in this version of indium - oxide ,",
    "superconductivity survived in samples with @xmath60.24 , and , somewhat paradoxically ( but reconcilable by an inhomogeneous scenario discussed in this paper ) , insulating behavior sets in at smaller disorder , for @xmath70.3 .",
    "the observation that both limits are below the ioffe - regel criterion motivated us to conduct the present study employing the same technique of tuning disorder and using the same material but with a much smaller carrier concentration .",
    "the idea was to see whether the problem is related to the existence of superconducting or to electron - electron ( _ e - e ) _ correlations effects ; in either case one expects the results to depend on carrier concentration .    in this work we map the mit in three dimensional amorphous indium - oxide films with a carrier concentration that is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than the material used in @xcite .",
    "no sign of superconductivity is found down to @xmath80.3k , and normal transport properties are observed for both the insulating and metallic regimes .",
    "however , the critical disorder , separating the metallic from the insulating regime , still appears to be given by @xmath10.3 as in the electron - rich phase . by comparison ,",
    "the mit in the previously studied @xcite crystalline version of indium - oxide occurs at @xmath10.75 , which led us to examine the structural differences between the two phases that might account for the different @xmath0 at the transition .",
    "we present data on the microstructure of both the electron - rich and the low carrier - concentration versions of amorphous indium oxide using high resolution microscopy and energy - dispersive local probe .",
    "chemical analysis reveals that the indium - oxygen ratio fluctuates across the sample on mesoscopic scales . combining this information with rutherford backscattering and",
    "hall effect measurements suggests that large spatial fluctuations of carrier concentration exist in these amorphous samples .",
    "the specifics of this inhomogeneity is argued to be a natural cause for a variety of transport anomalies in these as well as in other systems where superconductivity plays a role at experimentally accessible temperatures .",
    "the in@xmath9o films used here were e - gun evaporated on room - temperature microscope - slides using 99.999% pure in@xmath10o@xmath11 sputtering target pieces .",
    "deposition was carried out at the ambience of ( 2 - 5)@xmath1210@xmath13 torr oxygen pressure maintained by leaking 99.9% pure o@xmath10 through a needle valve into the vacuum chamber ( base pressure @xmath1410@xmath15 torr ) .",
    "rates of deposition used for the samples reported here were typically 0.18 - 0.8   / s .",
    "for this range of rate - to - oxygen - pressure , the in@xmath9o samples had carrier - concentration n in the range ( 5 - 13)@xmath1610@xmath17@xmath18 measured by hall - effect at room temperature .",
    "electron - rich in@xmath9o samples used in the study ( with carrier - concentration in the 10@xmath4@xmath5 range ) were produced with the conditions described earlier @xcite .",
    "the films thickness in this study was 900 - 1500   ,  which makes them effectively three - dimensional ( 3d ) down to the lowest temperature in our experiments ( @xmath190.3k ) for most of the samples used in this work .",
    "the as - deposited samples had extremely high resistivity @xmath20 of the order of 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath22 cm .",
    "these were barely measurable even at room temperature . to carry out the low temperatures studies , the samples @xmath20 had to be reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this was achieved by thermal annealing . a comprehensive description of the annealing process and the ensuing changes in the material microstructure are described elsewhere @xcite . for completeness , we give here the basic protocol that was used in this study .",
    "following deposition and initial conductance measurement that , in many cases required the use of electrometer ( keithley 617 ) , the sample was attached to a hot - stage at a constant temperature t@xmath23 , initially 5 - 10 degrees above room temperature .",
    "the resistance r of the sample was observed to slowly decrease over time .",
    "t@xmath23was raised by few degrees whenever @xmath24 over 24 hours was less than 1% ( and the value of the resistance was still higher than desired ) . to obtain a sample with @xmath20 that was useful for the measurements reported here usually took 20 - 38 thermal cycles .",
    "the annealing temperature t@xmath23 was limited to @xmath2370  k to minimize the risk of crystallization .",
    "the amorphicity of the samples during the annealing process was monitored by checking the diffraction pattern of a controlled specimen prepared on a carbon - coated copper grid .",
    "the control specimen was deposited simultaneously with the sample used for the transport measurement but its thickness was limited to 200 - 300    to facilitate high resolution microscopy .",
    "electron - diffraction micrograph of the as - deposited material is shown in fig .",
    "1a along with a micrograph taken for the same grid after a prolong period of thermal annealing resulting in resistance change of more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "note the characteristic broad rings of the amorphous phase , and in particular the absence of any diffraction ring of either crystalline indium - oxide or metallic indium .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig_1.eps    conductance and hall effect measurement were carried out on samples that were patterned in a 6-probe configuration using stainless - steel masks during deposition .",
    "we used a standard hall - bar geometry with the active channel being a strip of either 0.6 mm or 1 mm wide , and 10 mm long .",
    "the two pairs of voltage probes ( that doubled as hall - probes ) , were spaced 3 mm from one another along the strip .",
    "this arrangement allowed us to assess the large scale uniformity of the samples , both in terms the longitudinal conductance and the hall effect .",
    "excellent uniformity was found on these scales ; resistivities of samples separated by 1  mm along the strip were identical to within @xmath252% for all the samples used in the study .",
    "it should be noted however that microstructural studies performed in the course of the study revealed prominent inhomogeneities on mesoscopic scales ( 10@xmath26 - 10@xmath27   ) .",
    "the effects of these medium - scale irregularities on electronic transport are discussed in the next section .",
    "most of the conductance versus temperature @xmath28 measurements were done in the 1.3@xmath29t@xmath2915k range by a four terminal dc technique using keithley k220 current - source while monitoring the voltage with keithley k2000 . for lower temperatures measurements ( down to @xmath2280 mk )",
    ", we used a four terminal ac technique with the lock - in par124a . in all cases care was taken to maintain linear - response conditions by keeping the voltage across the sample low enough .",
    "this was verified by measuring the current - voltage characteristics at the lowest temperature of the experiment .    as in previous studies",
    "@xcite , we use in this work @xmath0=(3@xmath30)@xmath31 as a dimensionless measure of the material disorder .",
    "this is based on free - electron expressions using the measured room - temperature conductivity @xmath32 and the carrier - concentration n , obtained from hall - effect measurements , as input parameters .",
    "more details of preparation and characterization of in@xmath9o samples are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of the research was to identify the critical @xmath0 at which the metal - to - insulator transition occurs in the low - n version of in@xmath9o .",
    "this was accomplished by measuring @xmath28 over a certain range of temperatures , then extrapolate the data  to @xmath33(@xmath340 ) to determine whether the system is insulating ( @xmath350 ) or metallic ( @xmath36@xmath370@xmath38 .",
    "four different deposition batches were used in this phase of the research . in each of these ,",
    "thermal annealing was used , in effect , generating samples with different @xmath0 from the same physical specimen .",
    "a specific series of @xmath28 for samples labeled by their @xmath0 values is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "note that the @xmath28 plots for samples with @xmath390.4 are nearly parallel to each other , a feature commonly found in many systems on the metallic side of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the usual practice adopted in these cases is to extract the value of @xmath36 by fitting the measured @xmath28 for a given sample to :          that presumably describes transport corrections to the conductivity due to either weak - localization or _",
    "e - e _ interactions effects @xcite .",
    "1 offers a reasonably good fit to the data of samples having @xmath390.4 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of the conductance for samples that are in the immediate vicinity of the transition suggests that another @xmath28 law might be relevant , and that should perhaps be taken into account in extrapolating @xmath28 to zero temperature .",
    "so , before discussing the @xmath36 versus @xmath0 results we digress now to examine the data , shown in fig .  3 , for samples in the critical regime of the transition .",
    "the figure illustrates how the form of @xmath28 changes when the system goes from metallic to insulating behavior ( fig .",
    "the outstanding case is the middle curve that belongs to a sample that is _ just _ insulating ; it fits well a power - law dependence @xmath41 over a wide range of temperatures as illustrated in fig .",
    "a temperature dependence of this form is consistent with the interaction effect proposed by larkin and khmelnitskii ( lk ) @xcite .",
    "these authors observed that at the transition the contribution of coulomb interactions to the conductance may be expressed by :      where @xmath43 is the exponent that describes the spatial dependence of the coulomb potential @xmath44 ( with  1@xmath45@xmath43@xmath453 ) .",
    "note that this implies the lack of metallic screening at this range of disorder , heralding the approach of the dielectric phase .",
    "an alternative to the lk mechanism , offered by imry @xcite , has been invoked to account for a @xmath46 component observed in three - dimensional in@xmath10o@xmath47 samples near the transition @xcite .",
    "the imry mechanism takes account of the scale dependent diffusion that is a property of the critical regime . to obtain the 1/3 exponent",
    ", it also assumes a linear - with - temperature electron inelastic - rate @xmath48 .",
    "a scattering rate @xmath49 is consistent with the results of our magneto - conductance measurements in the range 4k@xmath45@xmath50@xmath4577k discussed later ( fig .",
    "the conductance component associated with the imry and the larkin - khmelnitskii mechanism is proportional to @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively . here",
    "@xmath53=@xmath54 is the inelastic diffusion - length ( @xmath55 is the diffusion constant that in the critical regime is scale - dependent ) , and @xmath56=@xmath57 is the lk interaction - length .",
    "the prefactors associated with @xmath58 of these mechanisms are not presently known so we can not determine their relative contribution . however , for either mechanism , the @xmath59 term should be observed once @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the correlation length @xcite and @xmath62 is the relevant scale for the measurement at hand .",
    "therefore , over some temperature range , @xmath28 of metallic samples that are sufficiently close to the transition may be describable by:@xmath63 where @xmath64@xmath37@xmath65 and @xmath66 is the sum of the contributions of the imry and lk mechanisms .",
    "as may be expected from the similarity between the two functions , the @xmath28 of the ( metallic ) samples can be fitted to either eq .  1 and eq .  3 almost equally well except near the transition where eq .",
    "3 is a better fit . for the sample with @xmath0=0.42 ( top curve in fig .",
    "3a ) , the best fit to eq .  3 yields a chi - square test value of @xmath67 0.013 as compared with @xmath670.08 for the best fit to eq.@xmath681 .",
    "in general , fitting @xmath28 to eq .",
    "1 typically gave higher value for the zero - temperature conductivity ( the @xmath0=0.42 sample data gave @xmath696.3@xmath70@xmath18 versus @xmath714.1@xmath70@xmath18 using eq .  1 and eq .  3 respectively , a @xmath250% difference ) .",
    "the difference in @xmath36 between the two fitting possibilities however becomes less important for larger @xmath0 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "4a . for comparison ,",
    "figure 4a also includes the results of @xmath36 versus @xmath0 for in@xmath10o@xmath47 , the crystalline version of 3d indium - oxide .",
    "it is noteworthy that metallic samples with @xmath72=@xmath73 are obtained in both systems ( @xmath74 , calculated by the free - electron expression , is @xmath148@xmath1610@xmath75@xmath18 and @xmath312@xmath1610@xmath76@xmath18 for the in@xmath9o and in@xmath10o@xmath47 respectively ) .",
    "quantum and _ e - e _ interaction effects are therefore quite prominent in the low temperature transport properties of these samples .",
    "data delineating the critical @xmath0 for the transition in the high - n version of in@xmath9o are shown in fig .",
    "is based on the dependence of the activation energy @xmath77 on @xmath0 for samples that are on the insulating side of the transition ( but close to it ) @xcite .",
    "these samples exhibit @xcite a peculiar @xmath28 law that empirically has been fitted to simple activation : @xmath78exp@xmath79",
    ". the critical @xmath0 may be determined in this case by extrapolating @xmath80 to zero @xcite .",
    "comparing the data for the three different versions of the material there are two issues that require elucidation ; the difference between the various phases in terms of exhibiting superconductivity at the experimentally accessible range , and the difference in the value of @xmath0 at which the metal - insulator transition occurs .",
    "note that electron - rich in@xmath9o samples with @xmath60.3 exhibit superconductivity for @xmath813k ( fig .",
    "4b ) while the low - n in@xmath9o version shows no sign of superconductivity down to @xmath20.3k even for samples with @xmath0 as high as 0.68 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "it seems plausible that the difference between the high - n in@xmath9o , and the low - n version , is the large disparity in their carrier - concentration .",
    "likewise , the low carrier - concentration of in@xmath10o@xmath47 ( n@xmath25@xmath1610@xmath82@xmath5 ) is presumably the main reason for the absence of superconductivity in this system @xcite .",
    "a difference of 2 - 3 orders of magnitude in carrier concentration is large enough to push down the superconducting transition temperature @xmath83 well below the experimental range ; a mere factor of 3 in the bcs potential suffices to shift @xmath83 from 3 - 4k to less than 10mk .",
    "the important corollary that follows from this observation is this : @xmath84 _ is not a good parameter to characterize disorder when superconductivity is concerned_. reducing @xmath74 ( by e.g. , decreasing the carrier concentration ) , weakens the bcs potential and the superconducting transition temperature will decrease more than by reducing @xmath85 to achieve the same @xmath0 . increasing",
    "the static disorder will reduce @xmath85 but this is not necessarily detrimental to superconductivity .",
    "it may actually enhance it @xcite . even in the case that superconductivity is suppressed by disorder it is a weaker effect than the exponential decrease associated with reducing the bcs potential ; the latter can easily push the transition temperature to well below experimental reach creating the false appearance of a superconductor to _ metal _ transition .",
    "@xmath0 may still be a descriptive measure of disorder when care is taken to keep @xmath74 constant in the process of varying the disorder as was done in @xcite .    despite the huge difference in their carrier concentration ( more than two orders of magnitude ) , the mit in the two in@xmath9o versions occurs at essentially the same @xmath0 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "our conjecture , that the apparent violation of the ioffe - regel criterion in the electron - rich in@xmath9o is due to correlations , is not supported .",
    "the low value of @xmath0 at the transition is therefore more likely related to some properties of the amorphous phase that differ from the crystalline version of the material where the critical @xmath0 is close to unity .",
    "the crystalline and amorphous phases of indium - oxide differ in several aspects ( in addition to symmetry ) . while the crystalline version , in agreement with theoretical considerations @xcite , behaves as a nearly free electron system @xcite , optical absorption due to interband transition of in@xmath9o samples are inconsistent with a parabolic conduction band @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath0 estimated for this material by using free - electron formulae may therefore be questionable .",
    "another possibility is that transport in the system is more inhomogeneous than might be judged by the space - filling , physically uniform structure reported for this material @xcite .",
    "note that when the sample resistivity is not uniform , @xmath0 based on macroscopic measurements of conductance and carrier concentration may not be telling of the relevant disorder and the calculated value of @xmath0 may differ from that associated with the ` average ' disorder .",
    "this could be a real problem when the inhomogeneity in the system is so gross as to cause current to flow preferentially through only part of the structure .    in the following",
    "we describe how some structural attributes of the amorphous indium - oxides give rise to inhomogeneities in these systems ( and possibly in other multi - component systems like alloys and metal - oxides ) .",
    "these may lead to a host of low temperature transport anomalies when superconductivity is involved in addition to an underestimated @xmath86    the stoichiometric compound in@xmath10o@xmath11 is an ionic insulator with a large ( @xmath23.6ev ) band gap .",
    "it is a well characterized material , has a cubic structure with 48 oxygen atoms and 32 indium atoms in a unit cell .",
    "the naturally occurring material however is oxygen deficient , and films of crystalline indium - oxide usually contain 5 - 10% oxygen vacancies @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to carrier - concentration n@xmath26@xmath1610@xmath82@xmath87 and a factor of @xmath252 around this value may be affected by changing the stoichiometry using , e.g. , uv - treatment @xcite .",
    "the limited range of achievable",
    "n is due to constraints imposed by crystal chemistry .",
    "amorphous indium - oxide , being relatively free of these constraints , may be prepared with a much wider atomic ratio of oxygen - indium .",
    "this makes it possible to make stable ( more accurately ; _ metastable _ with a long lifetime at room temperatures and below ) films with optical gaps between 2.5ev to 1.1ev and carrier concentration of @xmath25@xmath1610@xmath88 - 10@xmath89 @xmath5 respectively @xcite .",
    "the correlation between stoichiometry and carrier concentration of amorphous indium - oxide is shown in fig .",
    "the freedom from crystal chemistry constraints is perhaps also the reason for the emergence of _ compositional_-disorder in these amorphous oxides .",
    "this kind of spatial disorder has far reaching consequences , especially when superconductivity is involved .      the nature of the inhomogeneity however , depends on the _ type _ of disorder",
    ". quenched disorder of the ionic potential is common in most disordered electronic systems .",
    "large spatial fluctuations of carrier concentration on the other hand are unlikely to occur in systems with mono - atomic metallic systems but they are quite prominent in all versions of the amorphous indium - oxides .",
    "figure 7 is a micrograph taken by a scanning mode of a transmission electron microscope .",
    "the contrast mechanism in the micrograph is due to absorption ; changing the angle between the sample plane and the electron beam axis does not turn a black region into white ( as it often would in a crystalline sample where the main contrast mechanism is bragg scattering ) .",
    "there are no holes in the film and thickness variations are relatively small ; afm line scans show 5 - 20   surface roughness for 200    films deposited on glass substrates ( the smaller value obtained for the low - n version of the material ) .",
    "chemical analysis , using energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy and electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) revealed that regions with higher transmission ( white patches in the figure ) are richer in oxygen , poorer in indium content , and vice - versa for the black regions .",
    "variations in the o - in ratio between these regions could be as high as 15 - 40% for a sampling area of ( 50  )@xmath26 .",
    "the uncertainty in these measurements is mainly due to the background signal from the carbon support that includes a certain amount of oxygen .",
    "this source of error may be mitigated by making self - supporting films but a systematic study of thickness dependence will be necessary to get a more accurate estimate of stoichiometry .",
    "note however , that a mere 10% variation in o - in ratio is equivalent to an _ order of magnitude _ difference in the local carrier - concentration ( c.f .",
    "6 ) , which is tantamount to a factor of two in the thermodynamic density of states .",
    "the spatial range of these compositional fluctuations can be assessed by fourier transforming line scans of the intensity , averaged over the entire micrograph area ( only a part of which is shown in fig .",
    "results of such analyses , done for the two in@xmath9o samples of fig .",
    "7 , are shown in fig .",
    "the flattening out of the spectrum at the small spatial scales is partly due to the smoothing effect of oxygen - diffusion and partly due to the stem resolution .",
    "note that the low - n in@xmath9o is somewhat more uniform than the high - n version .",
    "however , in both cases the spectrum is skewed in a similar way and the compositional fluctuations persist over scales extending up to 300 - 800   .",
    "these scales are comparable or even larger than the length scales that may be relevant for transport ; @xmath90 ( and @xmath91 , the superconducting coherence - length ) .",
    "pertinent information on these transport parameters may be obtained by analyzing magneto - conductance ( mc ) data .",
    "we have measured ten in@xmath9o metallic samples at 4k , and for comparison , also at 77k . at small fields the mc for all metallic samples was positive and",
    "that remained so down to 2k ( tested on one of these samples ) .",
    "spin orbit scattering in in@xmath9o is therefore rather limited in strength .",
    "a negative mc component however does appear at high fields as seen in the data described in figure 9 .",
    "figure 9 compares the mc of our most metallic in@xmath9o sample with a in@xmath92o@xmath47 sample of comparable resistivity .",
    "the latter system has been extensively studied and exhibits @xmath93 of 1000 - 1300    at @xmath24k for samples with @xmath0 of order 2 - 5 @xcite .",
    "the field at which the mc crosses over from h@xmath26 to a weaker dependence is @xmath225 times larger for the in@xmath9o sample .",
    "this suggests a considerably smaller @xmath93 than that of in@xmath10o@xmath47 at the same temperature .",
    "we have analyzed the low field mc for the amorphous sample using kawabata s @xcite expression : @xmath94=@xmath95 in conjunction with the drude expression for the conductivity @xmath96=@xmath97 using m*@xmath20.28@xmath16(mass of the free electron ) .",
    "this yielded the parameters : @xmath986@xmath1610@xmath99s , @xmath10012    ( using @xmath1012@xmath1610@xmath102cm / s ) , @xmath93(at 4.1k)=450@xmath2520   , @xmath1032  cm@xmath26/s . the interaction length is then 70    and 140    depending on whether @xmath105=@xmath57 or @xmath106 respectively . at temperatures relevant for our experiments these length scales are not large enough to average out the compositional inhomogeneities observed in these materials .        although it may have no direct bearing on the main issues of this work , it is important to point out that the mc of the in@xmath9o samples differs from the mc in the crystalline version by more than the magnitude of @xmath93 .",
    "the negative mc component of the metallic sample in fig .",
    "9 , that is just observable above @xmath26.5 t , becomes quite noticeable at lower temperatures ( but down to 1.4k it is only seen above @xmath23 t ) .",
    "the mc in diffusive in@xmath10o@xmath47 samples is purely positive , throughout the entire range up to fields of 12 t and down in temperature from 77k to @xmath240mk .",
    "there is also a difference between in@xmath9o and the crystalline in@xmath10o@xmath47 version in terms of the mc for insulating samples ; the mc in insulating in@xmath10o@xmath47 starts positive and becomes negative at high fields @xcite while just the opposite is observed in our insulating in@xmath9o sample ( with @xmath0=0.23 ) for temperatures below 3k .",
    "results of mc measurements on in@xmath9o films were reported by lee et al @xcite .",
    "their results differed from ours ; they observed positive mc only above 8 - 10k while the low field mc became negative at lower temperatures .",
    "it should be noted however that the in@xmath9o films of lee et al were presumably the electron - rich version ( and exhibited superconductivity for @xmath50@xmath451k when the resistance was low enough ) . more work is needed to identify the origin of the mechanism that is responsible for the negative mc at both the metallic and insulating regime of the different versions of in@xmath9o .",
    "fluctuations in carrier concentrations on the spatial scales observed in the amorphous indium - oxides constitute an important type of disorder .",
    "screening is more effective in regions with larger n , which means that the conductance in these regions is higher ( although the mobility may be impaired in these regions , partially offsetting this effect ) . when the sample resistivity is not uniform , @xmath0 based on macroscopic measurements of conductance and carrier concentration will in general be underestimated ; since current naturally flows preferentially through the more conducting regions of the structure , the `` active '' volume for transport is smaller than that assumed by its geometric dimensions .",
    "the non - uniform current distribution affects the perceived values of both , the conductivity @xmath107 and the carrier - concentration @xmath108 which are used in assigning a value of @xmath0 to a given sample .",
    "this is based on @xmath0=(3@xmath109)@xmath110 and therefore errors in @xmath108 have a lesser effect than errors in @xmath111 unless the system inhomogeneity is excessive ( the hall voltage may be significantly suppressed in e.g. , filamentary conduction yielding a spuriously huge @xmath108 ) .",
    "it seems intuitively plausible that , in general , inhomogeneity causes @xmath32 to be underestimated while the hall - derived @xmath108 is if anything somewhat overestimated .",
    "these consideration may explain why the metal to insulator transition in the two versions of in@xmath9o occurs for @xmath0 that is smaller than unity .",
    "at the same time , for scales of the order of millimeters , these compositional inhomogeneities are well - averaged , and therefore the excellent uniformity of the in@xmath9o films mentioned in section ii is not at variance with the observed mesoscale inhomogeneity .",
    "a more profound modification of transport should occur at low temperatures when superconductivity appears .",
    "this is where the value of @xmath0 as a parameter that characterizes disorder has questionable merit ; carrier - rich regions of the system are more likely to go superconducting than regions where n is small . as demonstrated in fig .  5 , the sample with the larger carrier concentration goes superconducting despite having a _ smaller _ @xmath0 than a sample with a larger mean - free - path .",
    "it is the bcs potential that plays the crucial role in these situations , and when its local value fluctuates in the system on scales that are comparable or larger than @xmath91 , inhomogeneity is dramatically enhanced . in this case",
    "the system breaks into a ` granular - like ' structure ; islands of zero resistance precipitate in a normal matrix .",
    "the latter may be either metallic or insulating depending on the ( average ) degree of disorder , carrier concentration , and temperature .",

    "\\4 ) a non - monotonous mc is observable in in@xmath9o films near their sit ; the conductance first decreases with field reaching , in some cases , a much smaller value then its asymptotic value at high fields @xcite .",
    "other possible manifestations of superconducting islands coexisting with normal regions were obtained in @xcite and in recent tunneling experiments from large area electrodes into in@xmath9o films in the insulating regime @xcite .",
    "it may be difficult to observe these non - superconducting regions by a scanning tunneling technique ( stm ) due to the spreading resistance associated with resistive paths but the inhomogeneous nature of superconductivity has been seen by stm in in@xmath9o films @xcite ( and in tin @xcite ) .",
    "the observation that the in@xmath9o films are structurally continuous , and being amorphous , free of grain boundaries etc .",
    ", was an inducement to offer an inherent ` disorder induced granularity ' scenario for these phenomena @xcite .",
    "the effects associated with this scenario ought to have been apparent in _ all _ materials near their sit provided that superconductivity is not suppressed by disorder before a ` critical @xmath112'@xmath113 is reached @xcite .",
    "several systems such as tin @xcite and nbn @xcite indeed exhibited some of these transport anomalies near their sit ( specifically , a non - monotonous mc ) .",
    "however , the magnitude of these effects were not as prominent as they are in the electron - rich in@xmath9o samples . moreover , these peculiarities are not usually observed near the _ disorder - tuned _",
    "@xcite sit of amorphous bi and pb films , except when structural granularity was deliberately introduced to modify their microstructure @xcite .",
    "we have therefore to conclude that , while the ` inherent disorder - induced ' inhomogeneity is a plausible physical scenario , it appears that the modulation - depth of local superconducting properties caused by potential fluctuations is much less conspicuous than that of fluctuations in carrier - density . in other words ,",
    "the _ type _ of disorder is an important ingredient in producing prominent ` granularity effects ' near the sit . unless they break time - reversal symmetry , potential fluctuation have a mild effect on @xmath83 ( which can be of either sign @xcite ) .",
    "spatial fluctuation in the bcs potential , on the other hand , is a powerful agent for local modulation of @xmath83 , and it may facilitate the two - phase state responsible to the observed transport peculiarities . an effective way to achieve it is by modulating carrier concentration , which seem to occur naturally in the amorphous indium - oxides .",
    "this type of disorder is energetically unfavorable in a mono - atomic system like amorphous bi unless the system is physically discontinuous . on the other hand , in an alloy or metal oxide , compositional - disorder",
    "may compensate for the carrier concentration difference by a chemical one without compromising the physical continuity of the structure .",
    "grain boundaries and other extended defects may also play a role in creating inhomogeneous bcs potential distribution when pair - breakers such as magnetic impurities ( that tend to segregate at these defects ) are present in the system .",
    "the corollary that emerges from these considerations is that while disorder is tantamount to inhomogeneity , the degree and detailed nature of the resulting spatial fluctuation depend on the _ type _ of disorder , not just on its magnitude",
    ". this distinction may be less important for the non - interacting system but it is crucial for the subtle case of superconductivity .",
    "one of the questions raised in the study of insulating in@xmath9o films near the sit @xcite was the origin of the dependence of the conductance on temperature @xmath78exp@xmath79 .",
    "an arrhenius law for @xmath28 is intriguing in that it occurs in a disordered system for which the natural choice is the variable - range - hopping ( vrh ) mechanism @xcite , which indeed is exhibited by just - insulating samples of the low - n version of in@xmath9o ( fig .",
    "the study reported in @xcite used a three - dimensional system .",
    "the activation energy of the insulating samples increased monotonously with disorder reaching a mximum of @xmath1147k before the conduction mechanism reverted to variable range hopping @xcite .",
    "it was shown in a subsequent study using a _",
    "two_-dimensional version of this system that @xmath77 may reach 14 - 15k @xcite for a similar range of @xmath0 used in the 3d system .",
    "the dimensionality and length dependence of @xmath77 are characteristic signs of a percolative phenomenon .",
    "these observations suggest that the origin of the @xmath115exp@xmath116 or a somewhat _",
    "faster _ dependence @xcite , is the appearance of superconducting islands in an insulating medium . in the insulating regime of the sit ( and at temperatures where the material is fully in the normal state ) , most of the electron - rich areas are weakly coupled to other regions , say with typical coefficient @xmath1171 . as the temperature falls below the local @xmath83 of these regions , the coupling ( being now controlled by andreev processes ) ,",
    "becomes @xmath1181 .",
    "superconducting islands that were part of the current - carrying - network ( ccn ) in the normal state , will be effectively removed from it thereby forcing a new and less conductive ccn .",
    "transport in the vrh regime takes place in a tenuous current - carrying - network that , for a given disorder , becomes more rarefied as temperature is lowered .",
    "an _ exponential _ reduction of the conductance occurs when part of the sample volume is eliminated from the transport @xcite , a role that the superconducting islands may effectively take .",
    "the range of disorder where this mechanism is relevant is limited to the vicinity of the transition ; for sufficiently strong disorder the localization length @xmath119 will be everywhere smaller than @xmath91 and there will be no superconducting islands in the system . in this case",
    "the transport mechanism will revert to normal vrh as seen in the experiment @xcite . at small disorder , on the other hand",
    ", many of the superconducting islands may be josephson - coupled to form large superconducting clusters .",
    "effective josephson coupling through _ insulating _",
    "in@xmath9o layers has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "global superconductivity may result in the system with the associated percolative features discussed in reference @xcite . in this picture @xmath28",
    "is a non - trivial result of hopping conductivity modulated by the compounded effect of the temperature - dependent appearance of superconducting islands _ and _ the evolution with temperature of their local pair - potential . in view of the transport features described above this seems to be a prime avenue to look for a solution to this problem .",
