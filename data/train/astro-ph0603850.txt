    "m83 ( ngc 5236 ) is a nearby sabc galaxy that is nearly face - on ( @xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "it is relatively nearby with distance estimates ranging from 3.75 mpc @xcite to 8.9 mpc @xcite .",
    "we have opted to use the cepheid - established distance of 4.5 mpc @xcite .",
    "the proximity of m83 has made it an ideal candidate for observations at all wavelengths .",
    "the presence of large quantities of gas and dust imply observable levels of enhanced star formation .",
    "previous studies have also noted vigorous star formation in the nuclear region of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similar star formation activity is evidenced by the discovery of six supernovae in modern times : sn 1923a , sn 1945b , sn 1950b , sn 1957d , sn 1968l , and sn 1983n .",
    "the results of monitoring of these historical supernovae in the radio have been presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to the radio surveys , several x - ray studies have been performed on m83 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite included it in a larger survey of nearby galaxies . @xcite also presented detailed analyses of _ chandra _ observations of this galaxy .",
    "optical surveys have also provided evidence of high star formation in the form of hii regions @xcite and supernova remnants ( snrs * ? ? ?",
    "comparisons of compact sources at multiple wavelengths provide critical information about late stages of stellar evolution , emission mechanisms , the transition of supernovae to supernova remnants , etc .",
    "in this paper we report on the results of analysis of fifteen years of radio observations of m83 , including new , never before published data from 1990 and 1998 .",
    "we will begin by describing the observations dating back to 1981 , before the very large array was completed . a brief description of the analysis techniques",
    "will then be presented in section 3 . in the sections that follow",
    ", results will be presented for specific sources .",
    "the first discussion will be a brief report on the observed historical supernovae .",
    "for the remaining unidentified sources , comparisons with optical and x - ray studies will be presented to identify snrs , hii regions and x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) . finally , a discussion of the complex nuclear emission will be presented .",
    "we have observed m83 with the vla several times between 1981 and 1998 .",
    "table [ obs ] summarizes each of the observations .",
    "reports of the 1981 , 1983 and 1990 observations have been presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the new 1998 observations will be presented here . for this paper , some of the older data",
    "have been reprocessed and reimaged in order to to allow consistent analyses and comparisons over many years .",
    "the first 20 cm observation was performed on 10 april 1981 using 22 antennas while the array was being moved from a to b configuration .",
    "more 20 cm observations were done on 15 and 17 december 1983 in the bna hybrid configuration .",
    "a 6 cm observation was taken on 14 march 1984 in the hybrid cnb configuration .",
    "these observations were reported in @xcite m83 was observed again at 6 cm on 14 october 1990 ( cnb ) , and at 20 cm on 30 june 1990 ( bna ) .",
    "these were reported in @xcite .",
    "finally , we observed m83 in 1998 at 20 cm ( june 13 and 15 , bna ) and 6 cm ( october 31 and",
    "november 1 , cnb ) .",
    "@xcite reported results of a 1992 20 cm observation taken in b configuration .",
    "the original 1990 observation was believed to be corrupted at the time due to the dramatic fading of sn 1957d . in reprocessing the this observation ,",
    "we have determined it to be good , and since the array was in the preferred configuration , we have opted to present the observation here for the first time .",
    "all of the data were processed using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) provided by nrao .",
    "flux calibration was performed using 3c286 as the primary source calibrator .",
    "to correct for atmospheric phase variations , a secondary calibrator , b1354 - 132 was used for the 1983 and 1984 observations , and j1316 - 336 was used for the 1990 and 1998 data sets . due to changes in the aips system ,",
    "we were unable to reproduce adequate maps for the earliest observations .",
    "we have opted to use the original maps presented in @xcite .",
    "the remaining data were then imaged using the aips task imagr using a briggs robustness parameter of 0 .",
    "this value has the advantage of minimizing noise while allowing for excellent point source detection in resultant images . during the imaging process , we also employed self - calibration loops using the task calib to improve the noise levels on the maps .",
    "the data sets were deconvolved using gaussian restoring beams , the sizes of which are indicated in table [ obs ] .",
    "the deconvolved beams were determined using the values for the `` dirty '' beam , calculated from the fourier transform of the _ u - v _ plane coverage .",
    "after imaging , the task pbcor was run on each map to correct for the shape of the primary beam .",
    "an initial source list was obtained using the aips task sad , which searches for points in a radio image that are higher than a specified level .",
    "a gaussian fit is the applied to each detected area of emission , and fits that fail are rejected by the algorithm . many extended and slightly extended sources were listed as multiple sources .",
    "the list was compressed to account for this .",
    "nuclear emission was removed from the source list .",
    "finally , a visual inspection of the maps was performed in order to find sources that were rejected by the detection algorithm .",
    "the final list of sources along with peak flux densities at all epochs is presented in table [ flux ] .",
    "table [ spix ] lists the spectral indices ( @xmath1 ) of each source .",
    "the sources were then fit using the aips task imfit .",
    "the input model was a two - dimensional gaussian with a linear sloping background as was implemented in @xcite .",
    "fluxes for the sources are listed in table [ flux ] . where no value exists , we assume a 3-@xmath2 upper limit of 0.59 mjy beam@xmath3 ( 1983 20 cm ) , 0.14 mjy beam@xmath3 ( 1984 6 cm ) , 0.22 mjy beam@xmath3 ( 1990 20 cm ) , 0.11 mjy beam@xmath3 ( 1990 6 cm ) , 0.24 mjy beam@xmath3 ( 1998 20 cm ) , and 0.21 mjy beam@xmath3 ( 1998 6 cm ) . the 20 cm map shown in figure [ m83source ] shows the positions of the sources in the final list .",
    "the 6 cm contour map in figure [ galcont ] indicates the positions of some of the sources discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many of the fluxes of the sources listed in @xcite differ from fluxes listed in table [ flux ] .",
    "the reprocessing and reimaging of the older data resulted in maps with different deconvolution sizes than those in the older maps .",
    "this produced different flux measurements than maps using the older imaging algorithms .",
    "the advantage in reprocessing lies in the fact that all of the older data have been treated in the same manner as the new data .",
    "we detected emission from four of the six historical supernovae ( sne ) in m83 ( sne 1923a , 1950b , 1957d and 1983n ) .",
    "source designations for each of the sne are provided in table [ flux ] .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the nature of the historical sne is presented in @xcite .",
    "sn 1983n is detected only in the @xmath4 observations @xcite , indicating that it faded very quickly after maximum light .",
    "this is consistent with the identification of sn 1983n as a type ib supernova @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of sn 1923a in the radio .",
    "the 1990 observations showed a very faint radio point source , and the reprocessing of the @xmath4 data did hint at the presence of a source at the position of the supernova , though the flux level is too low to call it a detection . in the 1998 data",
    ", we again see a faint source that is coincident with the supernova . in the 1990 maps",
    ", the emission appears to be non - thermal in nature .",
    "@xcite report the presence of an optical hii region at the position of source 59 , coincident with the reported position of sn 1923a .",
    "@xcite could find no optical emission consistent with a supernova expansion shock in the area around sn 1923a .",
    "it is possible that we are detecting emission from both objects , though the radio emission is near the limits of detection for the observations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted a continuing decline in the radio emission from sn 1957d .",
    "however there has been unusual optical activity at the position of the explosion .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of an optical remnant of sn1957d .",
    "the remnant then faded below detectable limits within a few years @xcite , suggesting a possible drop in the circumstellar density through which the explosion shock is propagating .",
    "our radio observations also indicate the rapid decline of sn 1957d ( see figure [ 57dtime ] ) , and the spectrum seems to be flattening .",
    "this could indicate that the supernova is approaching the level of the hii region in the area .",
    "the supernova has not faded below this level , but the flattening of the spectrum could mean a greater contribution from the thermal emission of the gas .    as reported in @xcite , the radio spectrum of sn 1950b seems to have flattened and the flux has remained relatively constant across the 1990 to 1998 epochs .",
    "this would imply that the supernova has faded below the level of the local hii regions .",
    "sn 1950b occurred in a complex region of emission .",
    "figure [ 50btime ] shows the region and how the emission has changed over the course of the observations .      after studying the historical supernovae , we turned our attention to searching for radio counterparts to the numerous optical snrs reported by @xcite . in our search we identified four sources coincident with optical snrs .",
    "three of these radio sources had corresponding x - ray sources as reported in @xcite .",
    "the snr counterparts are listed in table [ snrcount ] and the positions are indicated in figure [ m83source ] . with the exception of source 39 , all sources exhibit continuum spectral indices consistent with those due to synchrotron emission models for radio emitting snrs @xcite .",
    "source 19 is located on the edge of the southern spiral arm of m83 .",
    "it has exhibited inverted spectra throughout the observations , with some flattening in 1998 .",
    "the source faded at 6 cm from 1983 to 1990 , and it has remained constant in flux between 1990 and 1998 .",
    "it could be again that we are seeing larger contributions from thermal emission in this region .",
    "the large uncertainties in the spectral index measurements stem from the faintness of the source .",
    "@xcite note the detection of a faint x - ray source coincident with source 19 .",
    "two x - ray colors are obtained : a hard color ( hc ) , defined as @xmath5 and a soft color ( sc ) , defined as @xmath6 ; where s , m and h are counts in the soft ( 0.3 - 1.0 kev ) , medium ( 1.0 - 2.0 kev ) and hard ( 2.0 - 8.0 kev ) bands , respectively .",
    "our resulting colors ( @xmath7 ) are consistent with snr emission using the classification scheme in @xcite .",
    "our radio measurements appear to confirm the identification of this source as an snr .",
    "source 22 has shown a consistent non - thermal spectrum throughout all observational epochs .",
    "it lies in the same region of the galaxy as source 19 .",
    "this is a crowded region of emission along the southern spiral arm , making isolated measurements difficult .",
    "source 22 has steepened due to the greater fading in the 6 cm maps .",
    "the source has shown fairly steady emission in the 20 cm band .",
    "like source 19 there is a coincident x - ray source .",
    "both source 19 and 22 also exhibit high h@xmath8 luminosities @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with there being a denser interstellar medium in the region of the sources .",
    "the lower resolution 20 cm map presented in @xcite indicates a high hi density in the area of sources 19 and 22 .",
    "the x - ray colors for source 22 are not typical for an snr ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , though they might indicate the presence of and xrb or an x - ray pulsar .",
    "source 35 has exhibited fairly steady fluxes through all epochs that we are considering .",
    "we have determined spectral indices for this source that are consistently non - thermal in nature .",
    "our _ chandra _ observations @xcite show that this source has a very soft spectrum ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , indicative of snr emission .",
    "source 39 differs from the other sources discussed here in that it has exhibited consistently thermal spectral indices over the time of observation .",
    "we note that the flux density of the source has remained fairly steady with some slight fading in the 6 cm band .",
    "this is more consistent with the behavior of an hii region than a snr .",
    "there is also a lack of x - ray emission from this source .",
    "@xcite identified the optical source as an snr candidate based on enhanced [ sii]:h@xmath8 ratio .",
    "further spectroscopic confirmation was not possible due to the relatively low luminosity of the region .",
    "it should come as no surprise that the largest number of radio sources in m83 should be associated with hii regions .",
    "m83 is known for exhibiting vigorous star formation activity as indicated by the large number of observed sne and snrs . by far",
    "the largest number of optical counterparts to our radio sources do consist of hii regions .",
    "nearly half of the reported radio sources have coincident optical sources identified with hii emission @xcite .",
    "the radio / hii counterparts are listed in table [ hiicount ] .",
    "it should be noted that the earlier observations represent some of the first detections of extragalactic hii in the radio at the resolution and flux level that were detected in m83 .",
    "this is due in part to the depth of each observation .",
    "the deep observations also contribute to the ability to see the spiral arm structure of the galaxy as seen in figures [ m83source ] and [ galcont ] .",
    "it is in the spiral arms where hii regions would be more abundant .",
    "it is clear from table [ hiicount ] , that we are preferentially identifying large optical h ii regions .",
    "@xcite establish a threshold excitation parameter @xmath13 to classify a region as large .",
    "only @xmath14 of the @xcite sources are classified as large by this criterion , while 12 of 21 radio detected h ii regions fall in this category .",
    "if the cut - off was relaxed to 250 pc @xmath15 , @xmath16 of the @xcite sources would be included , while 16 of our 21 radio detected h ii regions now fall in this regime .",
    "we have restricted our comparisons to optical studies with comparable resolutions to our radio observations .",
    "most of the radio / optical counterpart sources show consistently stable flux densities and flat spectra indicative of thermal emission processes .",
    "this type of behavior is what would be expected from the hot gas that composes an hii region .",
    "there are notable exceptions .",
    "source 27 , although coincident with an optical hii region , is a radio lobe to a background fr ii radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of source 4 has steepened with time .",
    "it has shown a consistent increase in 20 cm emission , while steadily fading at 6 cm .",
    "in addition to the associated hii region , there exists an x - ray counterpart @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the x - ray properties of source 4 are given in the next section .",
    "sources 53 and 55 are very faint sources .",
    "this leads to large uncertainties in the spectral index measurements for each of the sources .",
    "as noted earlier , source 53 is coincident with the reported optical position of sn 1923a @xcite .",
    "the measured flux of this source is dependent on the noise level at that position on the map .",
    "similarly , the faint source 55 is greatly dependent on the rms map level at the position .",
    "while the emission is likely to be thermal emission from h ii , we are unable to confidently identify source 55 .      a comparison of our radio source list with the x - ray lists of and @xcite yield 10 x - ray counterparts .",
    "these sources , along with the _ chandra _ source designation , are listed in table [ xrcount ] .",
    "sources 19 , 22 and 35 were discussed previously .    in order to constrain the nature of the x - ray / radio sources , we examine the x - ray colors using the values published in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray color - color plot is presented in figure [ xrcc ] . as can be seen , a clear dichotomy exists between x - ray binary candidates and snr candidates : sources 3 , 4 , 7 , 19 , 22 and 35 are snr candidates ; sources 24 , 32 and 36 are xrb candidates ; and source 28 is a highly absorbed background source .",
    "individual sources are discussed below . this same dichotomy between snrs and xrbs",
    "was seen by kilgard et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) in m51 x - ray sources that are coincident with compact h@xmath8 sources . in m51 , many of the snr - candidates are also coincident with compact radio sources .",
    "thus , these observations help place constraints on x - ray source classification based upon x- ray colors .",
    "sources 3 and 4 show consistently non - thermal radio emission over the three epochs , although for source 3 we can not calculate a spectral index due to lack of detections for at least one band in each epoch . in the radio source 3",
    "has shown a rise in 20 cm flux density from 1983 to 1990 . that emission dropped to below detectability in 1998 . at the same time",
    "the source brightened to a detectable level in 1998 after no detections in the two previous epochs .",
    "we do note that there are optical hii regions @xcite coincident with both radio sources .",
    "source 3 has hc@xmath17 and sc @xmath18 , placing it in the range of thermal snrs ; source 4 falls on the cusp between snrs and soft x - ray binaries ( likely lmxbs ) , with hc@xmath19 and sc@xmath20 .",
    "both sources exhibit no variability between the two _ chandra _ observations .",
    "similarly , source 7 has x - ray colors of hc@xmath21 and sc @xmath22 , placing it also on the cusp of lmxbs and snrs .",
    "consistent non - thermal radio emission over this time strengthens the determination of this source as an snr .",
    "there was an increase in 20 cm emission , while at 6 cm the flux remained flat .",
    "there is no identified optical counterpart to this source so we can not place other constraints on the source type .",
    "source 24 has x - ray colors indicative of an x - ray binary , with hc @xmath23 and sc@xmath24 .",
    "however , the location of the source within a dust lane could lead to absorption of the soft x- rays . as such",
    ", we can not rule out an identification of an snr based upon the x - ray data .",
    "source 28 has been of particular interest since it was associated with sources 27 and 29 @xcite .",
    "it was postulated that the sources could be part of a jet from the nucleus of m83 .",
    "high resolution _",
    "observations show an x - ray source at the position of source 28 .",
    "x - ray spectral analysis indicate that it is likely a background galaxy @xcite .",
    "radio observations show a source that varies slightly at 20 cm while fading rapidly at 6 cm .",
    "sources 27 and 29 show consistent non - thermal emission . at 20 cm source 27",
    "has brightened slightly , while source 29 has remained steady or slightly faded ( there is a large overlap in the uncertainty ) .",
    "both sources faded between 1990 and 1998 at 6 cm .",
    "the association of sources 27 and 29 indicate that they are the radio lobes of a fr ii radio galaxy that lies along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "source 32 has the faintest x - ray detected counterpart to a radio source in m83 ( l@xmath25 ) .",
    "the x - ray colors indicate that the source is a soft x - ray binary ( hc@xmath26 , sc @xmath27 ) . the soft x - ray color may be artificially  softened \" due to excess soft , diffuse x - ray emission near the source .",
    "there is also the suggestion of x - ray variability , with the source not detected at all in the second _ chandra _ observation .",
    "however , given the short observation time ( 20% that of the longer observation ) , the source would be at or slightly below the detection limit .",
    "this source lies near the confused nuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "this leads to a large background in that area .",
    "the measured spectral index for source 32 is quite steep ( @xmath28 ) , but this could be attributed to the uncertainty in the background level .",
    "the source could also be exhibiting radio variability similar to the suggested x - ray variability .",
    "source 36 has been a mystery in previous studies .",
    "it has no optical counterpart .",
    "it is not located in the high surface brightness area of a spiral arm .",
    "the presence of the x - ray counterpart was noted first by @xcite , and @xcite suggested that it was another background galaxy .",
    "radio measurements show a slight rise in 20 cm emission from the earliest epoch . over the same span of time the 6 cm has dramatically dropped .",
    "further analysis of the x - ray indicated that the source is consistent with an x - ray binary ( hc@xmath29 , sc@xmath30 ) , with evidence for x - ray spectral evolution between the two observations without a change in flux .    as illustrated in figure [ m83source ] and listed in tables [ flux ] , [ snrcount ] , [ hiicount ] , and [ xrcount ]",
    ", we detect radio emission from 55 point source sources overlapping with 6 x - ray only sources , 20 optical only sources , and 4 x - ray / optical sources .",
    "@xmath31 of the sources in our radio sample have counterparts in the optical and x - ray , which can be compared to the snr populations measured by @xcite for m33 , ngc  300 , and ngc  7793 . for m33 ,",
    "they report radio emission from 53 snrs with 37 optical and 11 optical / x - ray co - detections ; for ngc  300 , they report radio emission from 17 snrs with one optical , one x - ray , and two optical / x - ray co - detections ; and for ngc  7793 , they report seven radio snrs with one each optical , x - ray , and optical / x - ray co - detection .",
    "it should be noted that the resolution for the observations was @xmath32 , that the statistical errors of the snr spectral index measurements were so large that the spectral indices for most identified radio sources are not clearly identified as snrs by their own identification ( @xmath33 ) , and that a large fraction of their detections would not be classified as detections in this catalog as their flux measurements do not exceed @xmath34 .",
    "given these limitations , the fact that we have an approximate @xmath35 overlap at the other bands is in relative agreement with the range of co - detections of @xcite .",
    "the nucleus of m83 is very complex .",
    "the bright emission prevents the resolution of individual sources using the vla configurations for the observation bands here .",
    "@xcite noted that the optical / ir nucleus was not coincident with the radio nucleus .",
    "we are able to confirm this with the new analysis of the data .",
    "the peak of the radio nuclear emission is located at a distance of @xmath36 from the optical center .",
    "contour plots of all maps are shown in figure [ nuctime ] .",
    "there does exist evidence for multiple emission sources within the nuclear complex . from the 1983@xmath371984 observations to those in 1992 , there was an overall increase in the nuclear emission .",
    "figure [ m83profiles ] shows a series of three dimensional emission profiles of the nuclear region .",
    "the plots for the 20 cm band indicate the presence of at least four possible sources .",
    "the position of the third brightest `` peak '' is consistent with the optical center .",
    "@xcite report the presence of a hard x - ray source at this position .",
    "x - ray spectral analysis @xcite indicate that the source is consistent with a low accretion - rate black hole with mass @xmath38 .",
    "this compares favorably with the mass estimates of @xcite ( @xmath39 ) and @xcite ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "although we can not get accurate measurements of the nuclear peak flux levels in the radio maps , qualitative inspection indicates that the emission is non - thermal in nature which would be consistent with the x - ray results .",
    "the second highest `` peak '' seems to be consistent with the obscured `` dark '' nucleus reported by @xcite and subsequently studied in @xcite . in a later study , however , @xcite reported a different position for this `` dark '' nucleus .",
    "figure [ hidd ] shows positions of the optical nucleus and the `` dark '' nucleus on the 1983 20 cm contours . as illustrated in figure [ hidd ] nucleus appears closer to the peak of the radio emission of the galaxy .",
    "the studies of this mass concentration indicate that it is more massive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the the optical nucleus .",
    "@xcite also note that the `` dark '' nucleus is located near the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
    "the positions of the nuclear mass concentrations are given in table [ npos ] .",
    "the positions for the `` dark '' nucleus are offset in declination by @xmath41 , which corresponds to the deconvolution size for our observations .",
    "we would need the higher resolution of vlbi observations in order to isolate the radio emission sources .",
    "a vlbi observation using the long baseline array of the australia telescope has been performed on the nuclear region of m83 .",
    "the aim of these observations is to resolve the individual sources in this region to get a better idea of the distribution and to find multiple counterparts to the nuclear x - ray sources reported in @xcite .",
    "the results of this study will be presented in a future paper ( maddox et al , in preparation ) .",
    "we have studied the long term radio emission from compact sources in the galaxy m83 .",
    "the observations included previously unpublished data from 1990 and 1998 .",
    "we have presented the data over the fifteen years in a consistent manner .",
    "our observations have resulted in the detection of a number of objects in m83 :    @xmath42 it was shown that sn 1957d has continued fading , consistent with an expanding shock through a circumstellar material that is decreasing in density .",
    "sn 1950b has apparently faded to the level of thermal hii regions that are near the position of the explosion .",
    "sn 1923a has faded to near the limits of detection of these observations .",
    "we continue to show no detection of sn 1983n after its initial radio detection , consistent with it having been a type ib supernova .",
    "@xmath42 about half of the radio sources are thermal hii regions .",
    "a result that is not surprising due to the high star formation activity of m83 .",
    "the hii regions tend to be very large , exhibiting high excitation parameters .",
    "the largest regions are not detected due to the high resolution of our observations .",
    "it was found that ten sources were coincident with x - ray sources .",
    "the continuum spectral indices of these sources indicated that most were x - ray supernova remnants .",
    "we confirm that one of the coincident sources ( source 28 ) is the nucleus of a background radio galaxy with two radio lobes ( sources 27 and 29 ) .",
    "three of the x - ray sources are coincident with known optical supernova remnants .",
    "@xmath42 we note that the nuclear region of m83 has shown a slight increase in 20 cm emission in the radio peak .",
    "it is possible that there is an increase in accretion onto a supermassive black hole , which would be consistent with x - ray results .",
    "the 6 cm emission does not show this increase in flux .",
    "we confirmed that the reported optical / ir nuclear peak is not consistent with the radio nucleus , though there is evidence for a radio emission region at the position of the optical nucleus .",
    "it was seen that the nuclear radio peak was near the position of a second `` dark '' nuclear mass concentration that corresponds to the dynamical nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "our multiwavelength analyses have provided new information about the nature of the many , detected compact sources and the nucleus in the starburst galaxy m83 .",
    "studies of the compact sources are providing new information about late - term stellar evolution ( _ e.g. _ , mass - loss rates ) , emission mechanisms , the transition of sne into snrs , and the nature of xrbs .",
    "the combination of radio , x - ray and optical observations provide an excellent diagnostic for the classification of compact sources in this and other nearby galaxies .",
    "this galaxy also appears to have a complicated nuclear structure , including possibly multiple supermassive black holes , and may have minor variability . in the future",
