    "evaporating fluids are ubiquitous in our daily life and in industrial processes , such as ink jet printing  @xcite , coating  @xcite and particle deposition  @xcite",
    ". in particular for suspensions or polymer solutions , as well as fluids in confined geometries , the evaporation of individual components can induce fluid flows or a change of relative concentrations leading to changing rheological and transport properties of the constituents .",
    "for example , the evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet on a substrate leads to a capillary flow transporting the colloidal particles to the edge of a droplet , which finally results in a ring - like deposit  @xcite .",
    "the ring - like stains can be a useful tool to deposit particles and can also be disadvantageous when a uniform pattern is desirable .",
    "another example is the evaporation of droplets on rough or chemically patterned substrates .",
    "surrounding geometries and the wettability of a substrate have a large influence on the lifetime of evaporating droplets  @xcite .",
    "a thorough understanding of this impact of evaporation on the fluid behavior is mandatory to consequently optimize industrial applications and to improve our fundamental understanding of effects like film formation , droplet drying , or droplet spreading .",
    "there are numerous theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies of fluid evaporation .",
    "while most theoretical studies are limited to the macroscopic scale , experiments suffer from difficulties that arise by tuning the individual microscale properties of fluids .",
    "the thorough understanding of fluid evaporation calls for mesoscopic or microscopic details and the flexibility to tune the properties of individual fluid constituents independently .",
    "this is possible by means of computer simulations .",
    "computer simulations allow access to parameters which are not easily controllable in experiments and to tune the properties of individual fluid constituents independently .",
    "they can thus help to improve our understanding of evaporation driven fluid transport .",
    "simulations of evaporating fluids often utilize molecular dynamics ( md )  @xcite .",
    "while md offers a very high flexibility in the microscopic details , its computational cost is very high .",
    "therefore , md simulations are limited to very small length and time scales on the nanometre or nanosecond scale  @xcite . in order to reach experimentally relevant scales ,",
    "a continuum approach is more productive and our method of choice is the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm )  @xcite .",
    "the lbm has gained popularity for the simulation of fluid flows due to its straightforward implementation and parallelization .",
    "soon after its invention , the lbm was extended to simulate multiple interacting fluid phases and components and today a plethora of multiphase and multicomponent methods exists  @xcite .    the mesoscale nature of the method combined with the possibility to add additional fields , external forces , suspended objects , thermal noise , or complex boundary conditions in a very straightforward manner has made the lbm particularly popular for applications in microfluidics and soft matter physics .",
    "many of the physical systems studied in these fields include volatile liquids , where the effect of evaporation plays a dominant role .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that a number of groups has simulated evaporating fluids using the lbm recently .",

    "jansen et al .",
    "@xcite study the evaporation of droplets on a chemically patterned substrate and qualitatively compare the simulation results with experimental data .",
    "their method is based on a continuous removal of mass from the droplet and thus does not allow studying transport processes in the vapor phase .",
    "yan et al .",
    "@xcite present a thermal model to study the contact line dynamics during droplet evaporation where the liquid - vapor phase change is driven by a temperature field and a well defined equation of state .",
    "joshi and sun  @xcite present simulations of drying colloidal suspensions by means of a modified pseudopotential multiphase model following shan and chen .",
    "they assign a fixed mass flux to the system boundary which causes a reduction in vapor concentration and thus triggers a liquid - vapor phase change at the interface . however , their results are purely qualitative and a thorough analytical understanding of the diffusion in the system is missing .    in this paper",
    "we overcome this limitation and introduce an alternative evaporation model for the pseudopotential method of shan and chen .",
    "we focus on the two - component version of the method  @xcite , but the application to an arbitrary number of components and the multiphase pseudopotential method is straightforward .",
    "generally , the pseudopotential lbm is very popular due to its ease of implementation and flexibility when combined for example with complex geometries  @xcite , locally varying contact angles  @xcite , or suspended particles  @xcite . to trigger evaporation",
    ", we do not impose a mass flux , but instead fix the density of one component at selected boundary sites which induces a density gradient .",
    "the evaporation process is diffusion dominated and can be well described using fick s law with well defined diffusivities .",
    "we validate the applicability of our model by comparing the time dependent simulation results of an evaporating planar film and a freely floating evaporating droplet with their respective analytical predictions .",

    "we ensure the equivalence to the open system by mimicking a zero density gradient within the infinite volume outside the system .",
    "this way forces from the pseudopotential interactions only have an impact in the bulk of the simulation volume and not at the boundary .",
