    "phase transitions in non - equilibrium systems , conformational changes in molecules or atomic clusters , financial crises , global climate changes , and genetic mutations exemplify the phenomenon where a seemingly predictable behavior of a system in hand , persisting for a long time , undergoes a sudden qualitative change .",
    "such systems are often referred to as metastable .",
    "a popular choice of mathematical model for investigating such systems is a markov jump process with a finite number of states and poisson distributions of waiting times .",
    "the dynamics of the process is described by the generator matrix @xmath0 .",
    "each off - diagonal entry of @xmath0 is the transition rate from state @xmath1 to state @xmath2 .",
    "often , it takes the form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pre - factor , the number @xmath5 is the exponential factor or order , and @xmath6 is a small parameter . in many cases ,",
    "the pre - factors @xmath7 are not available , and the rates are determined only up to the exponential order : @xmath8    the reciprocal @xmath9 is the expected waiting time for a jump from state @xmath1 to state @xmath2 .",
    "the diagonal entries @xmath10 are defined so that the row sums of @xmath0 are zeros , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "hence , @xmath12 is the the escape rate from state @xmath1 .",
    "a markov chain with pairwise rates of the form or can be associated with a weighted directed graph @xmath13 where the set of vertices @xmath14 is the set of states , the set of arcs @xmath15 includes only such arcs @xmath16 that @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the set of arc weights .",
    "an arc @xmath16 has weight @xmath19 if @xmath20 .",
    "we set @xmath21 if @xmath22 , i.e. , if there is no arc @xmath16 in the graph .    in this work",
    ", we will consider continuous - time markov chains with finite numbers of states and pairwise transition rates of the form or .",
    "this choice of pairwise rates is instructive because it allows us to separate the timescales on which various transition processes take place in the system merely by letting @xmath23 tend to zero .",
    "our goal is to find a constructive way to calculate the sequence of critical timescales at which the behavior of such a markov chain undergoes qualitative changes , and give effective descriptions of its behavior on the whole range of timescales from zero to infinity .",
    "figuratively speaking ,",
    "imagine that the time evolution of a given markov chain is observed for some not very large fixed number of time units .",
    "we want to be able to predict what transitions the observer will see depending on the initial state and the size of the time unit .",
    "such a prediction is easy if the time unit tends to zero .",
    "then the observer will see only transitions between those states @xmath1 and @xmath2 that are connected by paths in the corresponding graph @xmath13 consisting of arcs of weight zero .",
    "if the time unit tends to infinity , then an equilibrium probability distribution will be observed .",
    "however , even in this case , the determination of arcs along which the transitions will be most likely observed , remains a nontrivial problem .",
    "on timescales between those two extremes , the problem of giving an effective description of the observable transitions is non - trivial .",
    "prior to advertising our solution to it , we give an account of works that provided us with necessary background and/or inspiration .",
    "long - time behavior of stochastic systems with rare transitions has been attracting attention of mathematicians for the last fifty years .",
    "freidlin and wentzell developed the large deviation theory @xcite in 1970s .",
    "they showed that the long - time behavior of a system evolving according to the sde @xmath24 can be modeled by means of continuous - time markov chains .",
    "the states of the markov chain correspond to attractors of the corresponding ode @xmath25 .",
    "the pairwise rates are logarithmically equivalent to @xmath26 , where @xmath19 is the quasi - potential , the quantity characterizing the difficulty of the passage from attractor @xmath1 to attractor @xmath2 .",
    "recently , buchet and reygner @xcite calculated the pre - factor @xmath7 in the case where state @xmath1 represents an equilibrium point separated from the attractor corresponding to state @xmath2 by a morse index one saddle .",
    "freidlin proposed to describe the long - time behavior of the system via a hierarchy of cycles ( we refer to them as freidlin s cycles ) @xcite in the case with no symmetry .",
    "later , in 2014 , he extended this approach to the case with symmetry @xcite replacing the hierarchy of cycles with the hierarchy of markov chains .",
    "these hierarchies can be mapped onto trees . in the generic time - reversible case , this tree is a complete binary tree @xcite .",
    "each cycle of markov chain in this hierarchy is born at a specific critical timescale .",
    "the corresponding hierarchy of timescales has only partial but not complete order : cycles of the same order typically have different critical time scales .",
    "an important ordered subsequence of critical timescales is given by the properly ordered reciprocals of the absolute values of nonzero eigenvalues of the generator matrix @xmath0 . using the classic potential theory as a tool , bovier and collaborators",
    "@xcite derived sharp estimates for low lying spectra of time - reversible markov chains with pairwise rates not necessarily of the form , gave a new definition of metastability , and identified the link between eigenvalues and expected exit times .",
    "a more general study , utilizing almost degenerate perturbation theory , was conducted by gaveau and schulman @xcite , in which a spectral definition of metastability was given for a broad class of markov chains .",
    "the transition path theory proposed by e and vanden - eijnden and extended to markov chains by metzner et al @xcite , can be viewed as an extension of the potential - theoretic approach exercised by bovier et al to the time - irreversible case .",
    "it is focused on the study of transition pathways between any particular pair of metastable sets .",
    "asymptotic estimates of the exponential orders of eigenvalues of the generator matrix of any markov chain with pairwise rates of the form , possibly time - irreversible , possibly containing symmetry , were given by wentzell in early 1970s @xcite .",
    "assuming the more concrete form of the pairwise transition rates , we have derived asymptotic estimates for eigenvalues including pre - factors for the case with no symmetry .",
    "these estimates are given in terms of solutions of certain combinatoric optimization problems on so - called w - graphs .",
    "greedy graph algorithms to solve these optimization problems were introduced in @xcite for the time - reversible case with no symmetry , and in @xcite for the general ( time - irreversible ) case with no symmetry .",
    "sharp estimates for eigenvalues for the time - reversible case with symmetry were obtained by berlund and dutercq using tools from the group representation theory @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this work is the single - sweep algorithm , a greedy graph algorithm for computing the hierarchy of optimal w - graph developed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we presented it in the form convenient for programming and used it only for the purpose of finding asymptotic estimates for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the large time - reversible markov chain with 169523 states representing the energy landscape of the lennard - jones-75 cluster .",
    "in this work , we extend the single - sweep algorithm @xcite for the more ambitious purpose of finding the whole sequence of critical time scales and effectively describing the dynamics of the system on any time scale .",
    "this description is given by the hierarchy of _ typical transition graphs _ or _ t - graphs _ introduced in this work .",
    "we will refer to the extension of the single - sweep algorithm as algorithm 1 .",
    "the presentation of algorithm 1 is significantly different from the one in @xcite .",
    "each step of algorithm 1 is motivated by the consideration of the dynamics of the system at an appropriate timescale .",
    "wentzell s optimal w - graphs can be readily extracted from the t - graphs .",
    "asymptotic estimated for eigenvalues are contained in the output of algorithm 1 .",
    "algorithm 1 offers a constructive way to simultaneously solve both freidlin s problem of building the hierarchy of cycles and wentzell s problem of finding asymptotic estimates for eigenvalues .",
    "contrary to @xcite , fredlin s cycles are found in the increasing order of their birth timescales .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic estimates for eigenvalues contain pre - factors if so do the input data .",
    "our proof for sharp asymptotic estimates of eigenvalues of the generator matrix for time - irreversible markov chains with no symmetry is provided .",
    "algorithm 2 computes the sequence of critical time scales and the hierarchy of t - graphs in the case with symmetry .",
    "algorithm 1 can be used in the case with symmetry as well , but its output should be interpreted in with care . a theorem giving the relationship between the outputs of algorithms 1 and 2 is proven .",
    "algorithms 1 and 2 constitute a graph - algorithmic approach to the study of metastability in continuous - time markov chains with exponentially small transition rates .",
    "algorithms 1 and 2 are illustrated on examples .",
    "an example motivated by astumian s model @xcite of the directed motion of kinesin protein , a molecular motor , is analyzed by means of algorithm 2 .",
    "the stochastic switch between two chemical states , breaking the detailed balance in this system , enables the directed motion ( walking ) .",

    "as we have mentioned in introduction , the weighted directed graph @xmath13 can be associated with a continuous - time markov chain with pairwise transition rates of the form or . throughout the rest of the paper",
    "we make the following assumptions .",
    "[ a1 ] the set of states @xmath14 is finite and @xmath27 .",
    "[ a2 ] the graph @xmath13 has a unique closed communicating class .    we remind ( see e.g. @xcite ) that a subset of vertices @xmath28 is called a _ communicating class _ , if there is a directed path leading from any vertex @xmath29 to any vertex @xmath30 .",
    "a communicating class @xmath28 is called _ closed _ if for any vertex @xmath29 the following condition holds : if there is a directed path from @xmath29 to @xmath2 , then @xmath30 .",
    "a trivial example of a closed communicating class is an _ absorbing state _ , i.e. , a state with no outgoing arcs .",
    "if all states of a markov chain belong to the same closed communicating class , it is _",
    "irreducible_.    in a weighted directed graph @xmath13 with a single closed communicating class @xmath28 , all states in @xmath28 are _ recurrent _ , while the rest of the states @xmath31 are _",
    "transient_. assumption [ a2 ] guarantees that the invariant distribution @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , is unique and supported only on the recurrent states .",
    "note that @xmath37 is the left eigenvector of @xmath0 corresponding to the zero eigenvalue @xmath38 .",
    "the zero row sum property of @xmath0 forces the corresponding right eigenvector to have all entries 1 , i.e. , @xmath39^t$ ] .    due to the weak diagonal dominance of @xmath0 and non - positivity of its diagonal entries , all its eigenvalues have non - positive real parts .",
    "this can be shown , e.g. , by applying gershgorin s circle theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to consider non - negative eigenvalues of @xmath40 instead",
    ". let @xmath41 , @xmath42 , be eigenvalues of @xmath40 , and column vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the corresponding right and left eigenvectors .",
    "it is clear that all non - zero re@xmath45 are exponentially small and parametrized by @xmath23 .",
    "let the eigenvalues be indexed in the increasing order of their magnitudes , i.e. , @xmath46 . under the assumption that all optimal w - graphs are unique ( see section [ sec : owg ] below ) , for sufficiently small @xmath23 , all @xmath41 are real and distinct .",
    "then the spectral decomposition of @xmath0 allows us to write the probability distribution @xmath47 , governed by the fokker - planck equation @xmath48 , in the following form : @xmath49 one can infer from eq .",
    "that the @xmath50th eigen - component of @xmath47 is significant only for time @xmath51 .",
    "more precisely , let us pick a pair of eigenvalues @xmath52 and @xmath53 and define a time scale @xmath54 where @xmath55 is sufficiently small so that @xmath56 . then , letting @xmath57 , we get @xmath58 therefore , as @xmath57 , the probability distribution on the timescale is given by @xmath59 eq .",
    "illuminates the fact that the reciprocals of eigenvalues are critical timescales .",
    "further , for brevity , we will write merely @xmath56 or @xmath60 while implying the stronger fact expressed in eq .",
    ".      the w - graphs were introduced by wentzell @xcite in order to obtain asymptotic estimates for exponential factors of real parts of eigenvalues of the generator matrices of markov chains with pairwise rates of the form .",
    "the w - graphs generalize the @xmath1-graphs introduced by freidlin @xcite for building the hierarchy of cycles describing the long - term behavior of such markov chains .    *",
    "( w - graph ) * let @xmath61 be a weighted directed graph satisfying assumptions [ a1 ] and [ a2 ] .",
    "a w - graph with @xmath62 sinks is a subgraph @xmath63 of @xmath64 such that    a.   @xmath65 vertices have exactly one outgoing arc in @xmath63 , while the other @xmath62 vertices , called sinks , have no outgoing arcs in @xmath63 ; b.   @xmath63 contains no cycles .",
    "assumptions [ a1 ] and [ a2 ] guarantee the existence of a w - graph with any @xmath66 sinks . if @xmath67 , there is the unique w - graph , and it has no arcs . a w - graph with @xmath62 sinks is a forest consisting of @xmath62 directed in - trees , i.e. , @xmath62 rooted trees with arcs pointing towards their roots ( sinks ) .",
    "the collection of all possible w - graphs with @xmath62 sinks will be denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "asymptotic estimates for eigenvalues are defined by a collection of w - graphs with minimal possible sums of weights of their arcs @xcite .",
    "we call such graphs optimal w - graphs and denote by @xmath69 .",
    "precisely ,    * ( optimal w - graph ) * [ defw ] @xmath69 is an optimal w - graph with @xmath62 sinks if and only if @xmath70    we emphasize that , in the optimal w - graph , the sum of weights @xmath71 needs to be minimized simultaneously with respect to the choices of sinks and arcs .",
    "therefore , a collection of optimal w - graphs @xmath72 , ... , @xmath73 can be built by selecting arcs of minimal available weights and making sure that that the chosen arcs emanate from different vertices .",
    "this observation was the starting point of the single - sweep algorithm in @xcite . from now on throughout the end of section [ sec : alg1 ] we will adopt    [ a3 ] for all @xmath66 , the optimal w - graphs @xmath69 are unique .",
    "assumption [ a3 ] makes the description of long - time dynamics of the corresponding markov process especially simple and graphic , and allows us to derive a number of important facts .",
    "assumption [ a3 ] is , in essence , a _ genericness assumption _ , because if the weights @xmath19 are random real numbers in an interval @xmath74 $ ] , then it holds with probability one . in natural systems , it might or might not hold .",
    "for example , it mostly holds for networks representing energy landscapes of biomolecules and clusters of particles interacting according to a long - range potential @xcite , while it does not hold for networks representing interacting particles according to a short - range potential @xcite .",
    "motivated , in particular , by the latter fact , we will abandon assumption [ a3 ] starting from section [ sec : sym ] .",
    "the optimal w - graphs are important for understanding the dynamics of the underlying markov chain on long timescales .",
    "first , the set of sinks of the optimal w - graph @xmath69 has the following significance for the markov process on timescales @xmath75 .",
    "if the process starts at any state in a connected component @xmath76 of @xmath69 , then it can be pinned at the sink @xmath77 of @xmath76 with extremely high probability : @xmath78 in other words , the process spends most of the time at the sink @xmath77 of @xmath76 during the time interval @xmath79 , provided that it starts within @xmath76 .",
    "second , it is extremely unlikely for the process to leave any connected component of the optimal w - graph @xmath69 on the time scale @xmath75 .",
    "third , if the markov process starts at state @xmath80 of a connected component @xmath76 of @xmath69 , then the unique path in @xmath69 from @xmath80 to the sink @xmath77 of @xmath76 is the most likely way to reach @xmath77 from @xmath80 , and the expected first passage time from @xmath80 to @xmath77 is at most of the order of @xmath81 .",
    "wentzell established the following asymptotic estimates for eigenvalues in terms of the optimal w - graphs @xcite :     ( wentzell , 1972 ) [ w_asymeigval ] let @xmath82 be the eigenvalues of the generator matrix with off - diagonal entries of the order of @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . then as @xmath85 , @xmath86    theorem [ w_asymeigval ] implies @xcite that @xmath87 if assumption [ a3 ] holds , then the strict inequalities take place .",

    "then as @xmath85 , for @xmath90 we have @xmath91    originally , we formulated theorem [ gc_asymeigval ] in @xcite but did not provide a detailed proof in order to stay focused on practical matters . here",
    ", we provide a proof of theorem [ gc_asymeigval ] in appendix [ app_a ] as we have promised in @xcite . the key point in this proof",
    "is the relationship between the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath40 and the w - graphs with the corresponding numbers of sinks .      in @xcite , under assumption [ a3 ] , we proved a weak nested property of optimal w - graphs , a pivotal property that serves as a stepping stone in the design of the single sweep algorithm @xcite and algorithm 1 , and facilitates a deeper understanding of the metastable behavior of markov jump processes .",
    "it implies that the optimal w - graph @xmath69 is obtained from the optimal w - graph @xmath92 by connecting certain two connected components of @xmath92 by a single arc and possibly rearranging arcs in the connected component containing the tail of the added arc .",
    "the weak nested property can be compared to a stronger nested property of optimal w - graphs taking place if the underlying markov chain is time - reversible @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following notations :    * let @xmath93 be a connected component of the graph @xmath13 .",
