    "the creation of electron - positron pairs from external electric fields ( schwinger effect ) has been a long - standing prediction of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of the qed vacuum has not been observed yet because of the required electric field strength which is of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "however , recent theoretical studies as well as technological advances have raised the hope that an experimental observation might become feasible in the near future @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", investigations have demonstrated that the electron - positron spectrum is extremely sensitive to the applied electric field profile @xcite .",
    "most notably , it has been shown that the particle production can be significantly enhanced by using optimized or tailored field configurations . in this respect ,",
    "the dynamically assisted schwinger effect was proposed as a mechanism to enhance non - perturbative particle production by orders of magnitude : superimposing a strong but low - frequency field with a weak but high - frequency field partially lifts the exponential suppression of the schwinger effect due to dynamical pair creation @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has also been shown that quantum interference can result in a drastic enhancement or decrease of the particle yield : for a sequence of single pulses it was demonstrated that an order - of - magnitude variation of the particle yield occurs upon changing the interpulse time - lag while keeping all other parameters fixed @xcite .",
    "most studies , however , have been based on very simple field configurations  mostly superpositions of single electric pulses  which are certainly not realistic in the sense of representing experimentally relevant fields .    a realistic field configuration , however , which is likely to be generated in an all - optical experiment searching for pair creation is supposed to be more complicated . theoretical models of such field configurations , which are in fact non - trivial solutions of maxwell equations in vacuum , include standing - wave beam pulses or superpositions of e - dipole pulses @xcite .",
    "previous investigations of the asymptotic particle number ( but not its spectrum ) in these electromagnetic backgrounds have only been based on the locally - constant field approximation @xcite .    to a first approximation , the electromagnetic field in the focal spot of these field configurations",
    "can also be approximated by a spatially homogeneous but time - dependent electric field which points in a given direction .",
    "this is based on the fact that the spatial scale for particle production , which is set by the compton wavelength , is orders of magnitude smaller than typical scales of optical lasers .",
    "the typical time profile of electric fields , which have been employed in the study of the asymptotic particle spectrum , are then given by an envelope with subcycle structure , including a carrier phase and/or a chirp @xcite .    in this publication",
    ", we investigate the possibility of generating an optimized field configurations from a superposition of two colliding laser pulses of different amplitude and frequency .",
    "accordingly , we extend the idea of the dynamically assisted schwinger effect from single pulse profiles to more realistic field configurations . to this end , we employ the quantum kinetic formalism together with an optimization method to investigate the electron - positron spectrum @xcite .",
    "in fact , similar optimization techniques have proven succesful in the related field of atomic , molecular and optical physics ( amo ) , i.e. in the optimization of the higher harmonic yield or the generation of single attosecond pulses @xcite .    we have to face an additional experimental challenge regarding the optimization of the particle yield in , for instance , e - dipole pulses : corresponding experiments will require large parabolic mirrors to focus the laser beam and these mirrors are supposed to cover a large part of the solid angle .",
    "accordingly , the particles should ideally be emitted in some specific direction , where it is still possible to put a particle detector . moreover ,",
    "electron spectrometers are usually sensitive in a certain range of momenta and are characterized by a finite momentum resolution . in this sense",
    ", we will focus here on the maximization of produced particles along the electric field direction within a specific range of finite momenta .",
    "this publication is organized in the following way : section [ sec : theory ] is devoted to reviewing the quantum kinetic equations for schwinger pair production and discussing the optimization method for our problem . in section [ sec : model ] , we discuss our model and describe the superposition of two laser pulses with sub - cycle structure .",
    "we present our results regarding the dynamically assisted schwinger effect for two colliding laser pulses and the optimal set of parameters , for which the particle yield in the forward direction in momentum space is maximized , in section [ sec : results ] .",

    "there are various equivalent ways to calculate the asymptotic particle spectrum for schwinger pair production in a time - dependent electric field @xmath1 , represented by a vector potential @xmath2 such that @xmath3 . in this investigation",
    ", we employ the quantum kinetic formalism within which all spectral information is encoded in the distribution function @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the canonical momentum whose component parallel and perpendicular to the electric field are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the corresponding kinetic momenta are then given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "as there is no unique definition of a particle number in an interacting quantum field theory , @xmath4 corresponds to the momentum spectrum of physical particles only at asymptotic times @xmath10 when all interactions are switched off @xcite .    assuming that the created particles do not act back on the prescribed electric field",

    ", we employ a multi - start method .",
    "this class of numerical method consists of two phases : after generating random solutions @xmath25 , these trial solutions are further improved in a second step . in this work ,",
    "the random solutions are generated using a simple constant probability distribution in parameter space .",
    "it has been shown that such an approach converges towards the global minimum as the number of sample points goes to infinity @xcite . moreover",
    ", the multi - start methods can be parallelized easily , resulting in an efficient numerical method to search our relatively low dimensional parameter space . on the other hand",
    ", the improvement of solutions is performed by optimal control theory based on the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bfgs ) algorithm .",

    "there have been various investigations of electron - positron production in standing - wave beam pulses or superpositions of e - dipole pulses .",
    "the appealing feature of these field configurations is that they represent actual solutions of maxwell equations in vacuum . a major drawback , however , is that particle production could only be investigated based on the locally - constant field approximation @xcite .    in this publication",
    ", we take another viewpoint and regard the electromagnetic field as a spatially homogeneous , time - dependent electric field which points into a given direction . accordingly",
    ", the quantum kinetic formalism as presented in the previous section applies .",
    "the assumption of spatial homogeneity is based on the fact that the spatial scale for particle production , which is set by the compton wavelength , is orders of magnitude smaller than typical scales of optical lasers .",
    "this can be achieved for an e - dipole field in the vicinity of the focal point .",
    "in such a case , it can be shown that the magnetic field vanishes at the focus such that the time - dependence is just determined by the driving longitudinal field @xcite .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the approximation of spatial homogeneity is strictly valid only at this particular position , whereas electric and magnetic field components are still existent in other regions . in principle",
    ", the magnetic field and the corresponding spatially dependent vector potential should be taken into account .",
    "however , the particle production in these regions is supposed to be suppressed due to the weaker electric field strength as compared to the field in the vicinity of the focal spot . as the latter gives the main contribution to the pair production rate , we completely neglect the spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "in fact , an ab initio investigation of the full problem is computationally not feasible yet .",
    "to be specific , we consider the superposition of two oscillating electric fields with gaussian envelope , which represent the field at the focus of two colliding laser pulses : @xmath47 with @xmath48 , such that the total electric field is given by : @xmath49 here , @xmath50 are the peak field strengths , @xmath51 are the laser frequencies , @xmath52 define the total pulse lengths , @xmath53 are carrier phases and @xmath54 denotes the time - lag between the two pulses .",
