    "<S> introduction. _ it is well - known that the readout of qubits is one of necessary steps in quantum information processing . phenomenally , the information stored in an unknown n - qubit quantum state @xmath1 can be partly extracted by directly applying the standard von neumann projective operation @xmath4 to the quantum register  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after such a projection , the register is collapsed to one of the computational basis ( basis states ) @xmath5 with a probability @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a directly projective measurement ( dpm ) and the register is detected . </S>",
    "<S> typically , dpm has been utilized to extract the binary quantum information stored in  @xcite , such as trapped ions , cooper - pair boxes , and the current - biased josephson junctions , etc .. essentially , due to the inevitable back actions of the the measuring apparatus , the detected @xmath6 is always less than its expectable value @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the dpm is not an ideal method to extract the quantum information in an unknown quantum state  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> qubits ( with two levels : @xmath7 ) by measuring the steady - state transmitted spectra @xmath8 of the dispersively - coupled cavity ( with frequency @xmath9 and decay rate @xmath10 ) driven by a frequency - controllable external field @xmath11.,width=302,height=113 ]    alternatively , indirectly projective measurements ( ipms ) can also be utilized to achieve the measurement of the qubits , where another coupled system instead the qubits - selves is detected . </S>",
    "<S> typical examples include , e.g. , dc - squids for the inductively - connected josephson flux ( persistent ) qubits  @xcite , optical cavities for the containing atomic qubits  @xcite , and cooper - pair box for the nanomechanical resonators  @xcite , etc .. a remarkable advantage in the ipm is that the back actions from the detected system could be minimized . </S>",
    "<S> if the condition @xmath12=0 $ ] is satisfied ( which means that the disturbance of the detector @xmath13 on the qubits is negligible ) , then the relevant ipm further becomes a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath14 is the hamiltonian of the n - qubit register and @xmath15 the interaction between it and the detector . </S>",
    "<S> note that the term nondemolition does not imply that the wave function of the register fails to collapse due to the measurement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for an unknown input state @xmath16 , after the qnd measurement the n - qubit register will be automatically collapsed to one of its computational basis @xmath2 with an _ ideal _ probability @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , qnd measurement is a conceptually ideal projective measurement ; the successive qnd measurements on the same register will give the same result .    as it can be easily detected with the current technique , </S>",
    "<S> driven cavity has been widely utilized to achieve the desirable ipm of the dispersively - coupling qubits . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , it is not difficult to probe the resonance frequency of a driven cavity by detecting the transmitted signals . </S>",
    "<S> if the qubits are dispersively coupled to the cavity mode , then the cavity is pulled by the qubits , depending on the state of the qubits . as a consequence , by detecting the shift of the central frequency of the driven cavity mode </S>",
    "<S> the qnd measurement of the qubits can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has been experimentally demonstrated by the cavity qed experiments with few qubits , and single basis states ( i.e. , computational basis ) of the atomic and superconducting qubits had been experimentally distinguished  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next challenge is to completely characterize an unknown n - qubit state @xmath16 by nondestructively measuring an arbitrary superposition of the single basis states with ideal precisions .    </S>",
    "<S> considering the practically - existing dissipation of the detector ( i.e. , cavity ) and also the statistical quantum correlations between it and the @xmath17qubit quantum register , in this letter we show that an unknown quantum state @xmath16 can be effectively nondestructively detected by the realistic qnd measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal still works for the mixed states , and thus could be utilized to explain the detected multi - peak structure in the most recent circuit - quantum - electrodynamics ( circuit - qed ) experiment  @xcite , where the detected qubits could be prepared / decayed at various superpositions of all the possible basis states .    _ generic model._the system proposed to nondestructively detect an @xmath0-qubit state is schematized in fig .  1 , wherein @xmath0 non - interacting qubits are dispersively coupled to a driven cavity . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , the preparation of the initial state of the qubits and detection of the driven cavity are repeatable . without loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that , the coupling strength @xmath18 and the detuning @xmath19 between the @xmath20th qubit and the cavity , and the detuning @xmath21 between the @xmath22th and @xmath20th qubits satisfy the condition @xmath23 this is to realize the dispersive interactions between the qubits and cavity , and to assure that the @xmath22th and @xmath20th qubits are decoupled effectively from each other . also , the decay rates @xmath24 of the qubits should be significantly less than that of the cavity , @xmath10 , to ensure that the detected state of the qubits has sufficiently - long lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , all the conditions listed above are practically satisfied in the current typical circuit - qed systems  @xcite .    under the rotating - wave approximation and in a framework rotating at a frequency @xmath25 , the process for nondestructively measuring the unknown @xmath0-qubit state could be described by the following master equation @xmath26 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(2\\hat{a}\\rho_n\\hat{a}^\\dagger-\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}\\rho_n -\\rho_n\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}),\\\\ h_n&=&\\delta\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^n\\tilde{\\omega}_j\\sigma_j^z -\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}\\sum_{j=1}^n\\gamma_j\\sigma_j^z + \\epsilon(\\hat{a}^\\dagger+\\hat{a}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the effective strength of the driving . also , @xmath29 is the renormalized transition frequency of the @xmath20th qubit , and @xmath30 is the detuning between the driving field and the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> for the ideal readouts , the dissipation of the qubits is assumed to be negligible . as a consequence , the expectable values of all the related qubit - operators , i.e. , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and the @xmath0-body ones @xmath34 are kept unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> our central task is to calculate the steady - state transmitted strength @xmath35 of the driven cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is essentially proportionate to the number of the steady - state photons in the cavity , i.e. , @xmath36 , which is determined by the following dynamical equation @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is further determined by @xmath39    neglecting all the statistical quantum correlations between the cavity and qubits , i.e. , under the usual coarse - grained ( or mean - field ) approximation ( cga ) , see , e.g. ,  @xcite , we simply have @xmath40 . then , by finding the steady - state solutions to the eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 - 4 ) , one can easily obtain an approximate transmitted spectrum : @xmath41 ^ 2 + \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)^2\\right\\}^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that , compared to the spectrum for the empty cavity ( emc ) transmission , the qubits only shift the central frequency with a quantity @xmath43 and the single - peak shape is unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> however , the above cga is unnecessary and the two - body cavity - qubits correlation functions @xmath44 can be further determined by solving the following dynamical equation @xmath45 note that the three - body cavity - qubits correlations @xmath46 , introduced above , is related further to the four - body cavity - qubits correlations : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , etc .. generally , the @xmath49-body cavity - qubits correlations are related further to the @xmath50-body cavity - qubits correlations ( i.e. , @xmath49 qubits correlate simultaneously to the cavity ) , and thus a series of dynamical equations for these correlations will be induced . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , due to the fact that @xmath51 for @xmath52 , these equation - chains will be automatically cut off and ended at the @xmath53-body cavity - qubits correlations . </S>",
    "<S> then , all the interested statistical quantum correlations in these equations can be exactly calculated , and consequently the transmitted spectra can be obtained beyond the usual cgas . </S>",
    "<S> it is emphasized that the spectral distribution @xmath35 including all the cavity - qubits quantum correlations may reveal @xmath54 peaks for an @xmath0-qubit state superposed by @xmath54 basis states . </S>",
    "<S> if the detected state is just one of the basis states ( not their superposition ) , then @xmath35 reduces to @xmath55 ( with a single - peak structure ) and the cavity - qubits quantum correlation vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> _ demonstrations with experimentally - existing circuit - qed systems._our generic proposal derived above could be specifically demonstrated with various experimental cavity - qubits systems , typically the circuit - qed one  @xcite . in this system , the cavity is formed by a coplanar waveguide ( of the length at the order of millimeters ) and the qubits are generated by the cooper - pair boxes ( cpbs ) with controllable josephson energies . at a sufficiently low temperature ( e.g. , @xmath56 mk ) , the coplanar waveguide works as an ideal superconducting transmission line resonator ( i.e. , cavity ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally  @xcite , the decay rate ( e.g. , @xmath57mhz ) of the cavity is about ten times larger than that of the cbp - qubit ( e.g. , @xmath58mhz )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , by adjusting the external biases , the cpb - qubits could be either coupled to or decoupled from the resonator , and the required initial state preparation and detection can be robustly repeated . for the emc case , the steady - state solutions to eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 - 4 ) can be easily obtained and the transmission spectrum reads @xmath59^{-1}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this is a well - known lorentzian lineshape  @xcite centered at @xmath9 , with the half - width @xmath10 .    for one qubit case with @xmath60 , the steady - state transmission spectrum of the cavity </S>",
    "<S> is expressed as @xmath61 ^ 2 + \\left[\\kappa(\\omega_l-\\omega_f)\\right]^2},\\ ] ] with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , for the unknown qubit state @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this is evidently different from the @xmath65 derived under the usual cga . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the spectrum function @xmath66 predicates that two transmitted peaks could be found in the spectrum . specifically , using the parameters in the experimental circuit - qed with one cpb - qubit  @xcite : @xmath67mhz , we plot respectively the spectra @xmath65 and @xmath66 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) typically for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . for contrasts , the spectrum of the empty cavity ( black line ) is also plotted in the figures . </S>",
    "<S> we make two remarks . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , if the qubit is at one of their basis states ( i.e. , either @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) , then @xmath65 and @xmath66 give the same single - peak distribution , which has been experimentally demonstrated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , if the qubit is prepared beforehand at the superposition of its two basis states , then @xmath65 shows still the single - peak structure ( when @xmath72 , @xmath65 superposes the @xmath73 ) but @xmath66 predicts two peaks : the locations of the central frequencies are unchanged , but their relative heights equal respectively to the superposed probabilities of the two basis states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath66 ( rather than @xmath65 ) provides the messages of all the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions should be easily verified with the current experimental technique , once the qubit is input at an arbitrarily - selected superposition state .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) and @xmath66 ( b ) of the cavity with a single qubit prepared at the state @xmath75 , typically for @xmath76 , and @xmath69 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> right : spectral distributions @xmath77 for the two - qubit register prepared at @xmath78 with @xmath79 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , transmission spectrum of the empty cavity ( emc ) @xmath73 is also shown by the black line.,width=306,height=113 ]    similarly , for @xmath80 case  @xcite the steady - state transmitted spectrum can still be analytically obtained : @xmath81 with @xmath82\\sum_{j=1}^2\\gamma_j^2 + [ \\frac{\\kappa^2}{4}-(\\omega_l-\\omega_f)^2]^2-\\kappa^2(\\omega_l-\\omega_f)^2 , $ ] @xmath83 , $ ] @xmath84,\\,\\ , z_{1,2}^{(2)}(0)={\\rm tr}\\{\\rho_2(0)\\sigma_1^z\\sigma_2^z\\},\\ , z_j^{(2)}(0)={\\rm tr}\\{\\rho_2(0)\\sigma_j^z\\}$ ] and @xmath85 + ( \\omega_l-\\omega_f)[\\sum_{j=1}^{2}\\gamma_j^2+\\frac{3\\kappa^2}{4}-(\\omega_l-\\omega_f)^2],\\,j\\neq j'=1,2,$ ] respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that , the spectral distribution @xmath77 may reveal four peaks , but @xmath86 always shows one - peak structure . </S>",
    "<S> the current circuit - qed experiments with two cpb - qubits  @xcite could be utilized to verify the multi - peak spectral distributions predicted above , once the cpb - qubits are prepared at the superpositions of their basis states . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , with the experimental parameters  @xcite : @xmath87ghz , one can plot the spectral function @xmath77 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) for the selected two - qubit state @xmath78 with : @xmath88 ( blue line ) , @xmath89 ( red line ) , and @xmath90 ( pink line ) , respectively . from these numerical results </S>",
    "<S> one can see that , if the two - qubit is prepared at one of the basis states , e.g. , @xmath91 here , then the transmitted spectrum of the driven cavity shows a single peak . while , if the two - qubit are prepared at the any superposition of their basis states , then the detected spectra should reveal multi - peak structures , i.e. , two peaks for black and red lines and four peaks for the pink line .    </S>",
    "<S> generally , if the n - qubit register is prepared at the superposition of @xmath92 basis states , then the cavity could be pulled by @xmath93 forms and thus there are @xmath93 possible shifts of the cavity resonance frequency . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the detected cavity transmitted spectrum will reveal @xmath93 peaks ; the superposed probability of one of the basis state determines the weight for pulling the cavity and thus the relative height of the corresponding transmitted peak . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one could presume that the qnd measurements of an arbitrary @xmath0-qubit state could be achieved by analyzing the transmission spectra of the dispersively - coupled cavity : from the locations of the central frequencies of the detected peaks , one can determine which basis states @xmath94 are superposed ; and from the relative heights of the corresponding peaks , one can determine the superposed probabilities @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussions and conclusions. _ our proposal is based on an important assumption , i.e. , each detection should be finished sufficiently - fast such that the influence of the decay of the detected quantum state is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is satisfied in the current circuit - qed experiment  @xcite , wherein each data for recording the transmission event of light through the cavity can be obtained in about 40 @xmath96 and the decay time of the detected cpb - qubit is , e.g. , @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the predicted multi - peak transmitted spectra could be verified , once the cpb - qubits are prepared at the superposition of various possible basis states ( even the mixed ones ) .    , ( b ) spectral distributions versus the time for the 2-qubit register prepared at the basis state @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> right : ( c ) time - averaged transmitted spectra over the time @xmath99s for different initial states : @xmath91 ( black ) , @xmath100 ( blue ) , @xmath101 ( red ) , and @xmath98 ( pink ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , the decay rate of the cpb - qubit is taken as @xmath102mhz.,width=309,height=113 ]    immediately , our proposal could be utilized to explain the multi - peak spectra observed in the recent experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , the time - averaged ( over a relatively - long time , i.e. , @xmath103s , the half of the decay time of the qubit ) spectral distributions shown there are not the desirable readouts of the two cpb - qubits , due to the significant decays of the detected states during these relatively - long measuring times for averages . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) we typically show how the probabilities of various basis states change with the time from the decays of the excited state @xmath98  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , during the decay ( e.g. , at @xmath103s ) the superpositions of the basis states are induced . </S>",
    "<S> thus , based on our proposal beyond the mean - field approximation , the transmitted spectra would reveal a relevant multi - peak structure . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenally , the decay - time dependent steady - state spectrum @xmath104 could be obtained by replacing the unchanged expectable values of the qubit - operators in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 8) ( i.e. , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) with the decay - time dependent ones  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the time - dependent spectral distributions ( due to the decay of the initial state @xmath98 ) was simulated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , which agrees basically with the corresponding experimental observation ( i.e. , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(e ) in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , except for the non - decayed ground state @xmath91 ( which corresponds certainly to a single transmitted peak ) , the time - evolution spectra due to the decay of arbitrary excited state , e.g. , @xmath101(or @xmath100 , @xmath98 ) would reveal two ( or two , four ) peaks . by integrating the decay - time dependent steady - state spectrum @xmath104 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) shows the relevant time - averaged spectra ( over the time interval @xmath107\\,\\mu$]s ) for these time - evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the locations of the averaged peaks agree well with the experimental observations  @xcite . while , the relative heights of the peaks ( marking the basis states induced from the decays of the input states ) are relatively low . </S>",
    "<S> this is an inevitable deduction of multiple qnd measurements performed sequentially within the averaged time .    in summary , an efficient approach to implement the qnd joint measurements of the @xmath0 qubits </S>",
    "<S> are proposed by detecting the transmitted spectra through the dispersively - coupled cavity . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements are the ipms of the qubits , and thus the relevant fidelities could be sufficiently high . remarkably , our proposal is a theory beyond the usual mean - field approximation and thus the statistical quantum correlations between the cavity and qubits are important . in deed , by specifically solving the dynamical equation of the cavity - qubit correlations , e.g. , for @xmath60 case , one can prove that the lifetime of the qubit - cavity quantum correlation is at the same order of the cavity - self . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the effects of the cavity - qubit correlations , i.e. , the transmitted spectra with multiple peaks , could be verified by inputting the superposed states of the qubits . </S>"
