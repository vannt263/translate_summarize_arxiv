    "the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of galaxies provide fundamental clues to the evolution of galaxies . until recently , measurements of the galaxy lfs were largely confined to near - ir to uv wavelengths ( e.g. , blanton et al . 2003 ; brown et al .  2007 ;",

    "the 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m channels lie on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody spectrum of stars , directly tracing the stellar mass with little sensitivity to the ism either through absorption or emission .",
    "the 8.0 @xmath0 m channel contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features whose luminosity is well correlated with star formation rates .",

    "wide - area infrared extra - galactic ( swire ) surveys , where the majority of the galaxy redshifts are photometric redshifts , complemented by spectroscopic redshifts from these surveys and the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds , le fvre et al .",
    "in particular , there are studies using 2600 24@xmath0 m  sources with 1941 spectroscopic redshifts ( le floch et al . 2005 ) , 8000 24@xmath0 m  sources with photometric redshifts ( prez - gonzlez et al .",

    "most of these studies use a combination of several photometric and redshift surveys .",
    "semi - analytical models of galaxy evolution have also been developed to provide theoretical basis for comparisons to the observed lfs ( e.g. , lacey et al . 2008 ) .",
    "one of the central questions involved in these studies is the assembly history of galaxies , which should depend on both galaxy type and luminosity .",
    "for example , franceschini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that the most massive galaxies are in place at @xmath12 , while , including fainter galaxies , arnouts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found about 50% of quiescent and 80% of active galaxies are in place at @xmath12 .",
    "accurate lf measurements as a function of redshift are essential to such studies .",
    "unfortunately , dividing samples into redshift bins reduces the sample size and increases both statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the presence of cosmic variance both within and between surveys and the heavy dependence on photometric redshifts .",
    "while photometric redshifts are frequently necessary for achieving a large sample size or a longer luminosity baseline , they can also lead to systematic uncertainties in the shape and evolution of the luminosity functions .",
    "moreover , as we find in this study , the redshift dependence of the definition of luminosity can be a problem for estimates of evolution rates .    in this paper , we present mid - infrared galaxy luminosity functions for @xmath13 in the _ spitzer_/irac bands by combining the irac shallow survey ( eisenhardt et al . 2004 ) of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs , jannuzi & dey 1999 ) with redshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , kochanek et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "for the 3.68.0@xmath0 m  irac bands we have well - defined samples with roughly 38005800 spectroscopic redshifts and a statistical power corresponding to samples of 46008000 objects through the use of random sparse sampling .",
    "we describe the sample selection , photometry , and redshifts in  2 , the lf measurement methods in  3 , and the lfs in  4 .",
    "we discuss our results in  5 .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , and use the vega magnitude system throughout the paper .",
    "we measured the mid - infrared galaxy lfs in the ndwfs botes field by combining irac photometry from the irac shallow survey and ages redshifts .",
    "this field is also covered by multi - wavelength data in the uv ( galex , martin et al .",
    "2005 ) , optical ( ndwfs ) , z - band ( zbotes , cool 2007 ) , near - ir ( ndwfs and flamex , elston et al .",
    "2006 ) , and far - ir ( 24 @xmath0 m , soifer et al .",
    "2004 ) , allowing us to use sed models to type the galaxies and make k - corrections (  [ sec : sed ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we briefly discuss the irac photometry and leave the discussion of photometry in the other bands to the references for each survey .",
    "the irac shallow survey imaged the ndwfs field to @xmath17 limits of 18.4 ( 17.3 ) , 17.7 ( 15.4 ) , 15.5 ( 76 ) and 14.8 ( 76 ) mag ( @xmath18 ) at [ 3.6][8.0 ] respectively for a 6  diameter aperture ( eisenhardt et al .",
    "we used the irac shallow survey ` sextractor ` ` mag_auto ` ( similar to kron magnitudes ) and 6  aperture magnitudes for our analysis .",
    "we note that the 6  aperture magnitudes include psf corrections for flux losses outside the aperture .",
    "galaxies were selected as extended sources in the ndwfs optical data .",
    "we were concerned about the reliability of the total ( from ` mag_auto ` ) mid - ir magnitudes since ` mag_auto ` may underestimate the total flux for extended galaxies by using a photometric aperture that is too small ( e.g. , graham & driver 2005 ; brown et al .",
    "the problems can occur when the field is crowded with many sources or the exposure is relatively shallow , and will result in galaxy size - dependent corrections that may mimic redshift evolution ( see appendix a ) . since the optical bands have deeper images of the field with better psfs , and the fixed aperture magnitudes do not suffer from this issue , we calculated the total@xmath196  aperture magnitudes in the optical and in the irac bands to test whether the irac photometry showed signs of such problem .",
    "we found a difference of 0.15  mag between the total@xmath196  aperture magnitudes in the optical and irac bands over the redshift range from 0 to 0.5 .",
    "in particular , at low redshift ( @xmath20 ) the irac aperture correction is smaller than the optical bands .",
    "since we view the optical correction as more reliable , due to the higher resolution and greater relative depth of the data at these redshifts , we define the total magnitudes as the irac 6  aperture magnitude corrected by the @xmath21-band total to 6  aperture correction , @xmath22 there may be further uncertainties in the ` mag_auto ` @xmath21-band magnitudes , but we expect they affect our estimates of the galaxy evolution rate by less than our statistical uncertainties (  [ sec : levo ] and appendix a ) .",
    "the ages redshift survey covers most of the ndwfs field .",
    "spectra were obtained for well - defined samples of galaxies in all the ndwfs photometric bands as well as for samples of agns .",
    "our present sample combines limits from the ages @xmath23-band and irac redshift sampling strategies ( table  [ tab : sample ] ) . in the @xmath23-band , ages targeted all galaxies with @xmath24  mag , complementing the @xmath25  mag part of the sample with redshifts from the sdss ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",

    "we excluded 155 agns ( see  [ sec : sed ] ) from the analysis .",
    "the final samples consist of 4905 , 5847 , 4367 , and 3802 galaxies corresponding to a statistical sample of 6111 , 7826 , 5499 , and 4782 objects due to the random sparse sampling .",
    "the spectra for the ages survey were obtained with the 300 fiber hectospec spectrograph ( fabricant et al .",

    "hectospec covers the wavelength range from 3200 to 9200 , with a resolution of @xmath37 . with multiple runs and",
    "passes over the field , objects with initially poor spectra were systematically re - observed in order to produce the final , high completeness of the redshift samples .",
    "they were reduced using both the hectospec pipeline at the cfa and a modified sdss pipeline ( hsred ) .",
    "the redshifts were verified to be correct by visual inspection . because there were multiple pointings for each region of the survey , fiber collision limits in the individual pointings",

    "( 2008 ) based on the same data .",
    "the choice of the 6  aperture represents a compromise between smaller apertures that are more sensitive to aperture corrections and larger apertures that are more sensitive to contamination by other sources . because of the magnitude limits required for the spectroscopy , the galaxies all have photometry in at least 4 of these bands , and on average have measurements in 9 bands . from the assef et al .",
    "( 2008 ) models , we fit all available data ( 0.210@xmath0 m ) with the early , late , and irregular templates for each galaxy and defined an early - type galaxy to be one in which 80% or more of the total 0.210@xmath0 m  luminosity is assigned to the early - type template .",
    "the 80% value is at the minimum of the bimodal distribution of early - type fractions ( see assef et al .",
    "the late - type galaxies are defined to be those do not satisfy the early - type criterion .",
    "this separates the `` red sequence '' from the `` blue cloud '' , as we show in figure  [ fig : el ] . after obtaining the spectral model for each galaxy",
    ", we used the templates ( assef et al .",
    "2008 ) to compute the k - corrections that are needed for determining rest frame luminosities .",
    "these k - corrections are consistent with the analytical approximations in huang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , as we show in figure  [ fig : kcor ] .",
    "the large scatter of the k - corrections in the [ 5.8 ] band is due to the spectral differences between the early and late - type galaxies , where the pah features contribute significantly to the late - type galaxies but not the early - type galaxies .",
    "although the [ 8.0 ] band is dominated by the pah emission in late - type galaxies , the scatter in the k - corrections is not as large as that in the [ 5.8 ] band because relatively few early - type galaxies are detected in the [ 8.0 ] band .",
    "the spectral fitting process also enables us to identify 155 galaxies that have significant agn flux contributions ( reduced @xmath43 in the template fits ) , which are then excluded for determining the lfs .",
    "these galaxies generally show the flat mid - ir power - laws characteristic of agns ( stern et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we test the robustness of the sed model in the [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] bands .",
    "while we can not directly test our estimate of the rest frame magnitudes , we can examine how well the models reproduce the observed frame magnitudes as we use less information .",
    "in particular , we can fit the photometric data by dropping one or both of the [ 5.8 ] or [ 8.0 ] data points and then compare the predicted and measured magnitudes .",
    "this is a somewhat unfair comparison , of course , because for the real sample we always possess the [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] magnitudes .",
    "we carried out the experiment for three cases .",
    "the first case is simply how well the sed models fit the [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] data using the fits to all the photometric data ( `` both 5.8 and 8.0 '' ) .",
    "in the second case we fit the sed using neither the [ 5.8 ] nor the [ 8.0 ] data ( `` no 5.8 or 8.0 '' ) .",
    "finally , in the third case we drop only the band we are considering ( `` no 5.8 '' for the [ 5.8 ] comparison , and `` no 8.0 '' for the [ 8.0 ] comparison ) . figure  [ fig : kcora ] shows contours of the magnitude difference between the model and measured magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : kcorb ] shows histograms of the magnitude differences for galaxies above the magnitude limits as compared to the distribution we would expect given the uncertainties in the magnitudes .",
    "based on these two plots , we can see that the k - corrections for the [ 5.8 ] channel are very robust . even if we use neither the [ 5.8 ] nor the [ 8.0 ] magnitudes ,",
    "the distribution of the magnitude differences is modest compared to our luminosity function bin widths and are largely consistent with the measurement uncertainties .",
    "this holds at 8 microns when we use all the available data , but there is significant scatter if we do not use the 5.8 and/or 8 micron data .",
    "nonetheless , while it is broader than our magnitude bins , it would affect our results little .",
    "after all , we always have the 5.8 and 8.0 micron data , and so we are generally closer to the `` both 5.8 and 8.0 '' micron case than to the others .",
    "the redshifts of the 8.0 micron samples remain low enough that the 8.0 micron band generally samples portions of the pah emission and so should remain well - behaved .",
    "the worst case scenario is that at @xmath44 we are approaching the `` no 8.0 micron '' case for the 8.0 micron k - corrections .",
    "we used both the parametric maximum - likelihood method ( sty , sandage et al .  1979 ) and the non - parametric stepwise maximum - likelihood method ( swml , efstathiou et al .  1988 ) to fit the luminosity functions .",
    "in the sty method , we parameterized the lf as a schechter function @xmath45 and we allowed @xmath3 to evolve as @xmath46 when fitting the lf , following the parameterization of lin et al .",
    "we did not allow the normalization @xmath47 or the slope @xmath48 of the lf to evolve since our sample size is not large enough to constrain the evolution of these parameters .",
    "estimates of @xmath47 will also suffer from cosmic variance at low redshifts where we have little volume . in the swml method ,",
    "the lf is defined in bins @xmath49 with value @xmath50 . in both methods , the parameters of the lfs in the sty method ( @xmath3 , @xmath48 , and @xmath8 ) and the swml ( @xmath50 ) method are calculated by maximizing the likelihood functions . since the absolute normalization factor @xmath47 is not modeled in the likelihood function , the shape of the lf determined from the sty and swml methods is not sensitive to the effects of large scale structure .",
    "we calculated the normalization @xmath47 using the minimum variance method ( david & huchra 1982 ) .",
    "since the sty and minimum variance methods are widely used in determinations of lfs , we leave the details of the calculations to other references ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "we checked the sty and swml calculations using both synthetic catalogs and by calculating the lfs using the @xmath51 method ( schmidt 1968 ; avni & bahcall 1980 ) .",
    "the lfs from the @xmath51 method are in very good agreement with those determined from the swml method , except for the very low luminosity bins where the @xmath51 results show a deficit of galaxies compared to the swml method , probably due to the effects of large scale structure .",
    "we only present the sty / swml results .",
    "each galaxy was assigned a weight based on the sampling strategy and the redshift completeness .",
    "the mean redshift completeness , @xmath52 , 0.93 , 0.93 and 0.96 for the [ 3.6][8.0 ] bands , depends little on magnitude , and the sampling fraction @xmath53 or 0.3 depends on the target magnitudes and the band ( see  2.2 table  1 and figure  [ fig : iraci ] ) .",
    "thus , each galaxy has an overall statistical weight of @xmath54 .",
    "we included both the irac and @xmath23 band selection limits in our lf measurements .",
    "we also carried out the calculations using only the irac selection limits , and the resulting lfs are consistent with the full analysis .",
    "this is expected , since at the irac magnitude limits we are losing few galaxies due to the optical flux limit ( see figure  [ fig : iraci ] ) .",
    "we measured the lfs using the sty and swml methods in three different ways for the [ 3.6][8.0 ] bands .",
    "first , we determine the lfs by applying the sty method to the entire redshift range ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is essentially a pure luminosity evolution model since we did not allow the normalization @xmath47 or the slope @xmath48 of the lf to evolve .",
    "second , we applied the sty method to the three redshift bins @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we chose the redshift bins as a balance between the number of galaxies ( statistical uncertainties ) and the bin width ( averaging over cosmic time ) .",
    "we fixed the slope @xmath48 and evolution parameter @xmath8 to the values obtained from the first method and fit only the normalization @xmath47 and @xmath3 in each redshift bin .",
    "this allows us to check whether the lfs evolve beyond the pure luminosity evolution model .",
    "third , we measured the binned lfs with the swml method in the three redshift bins and then fit them jointly with schechter functions , where we fixed the faint end slope @xmath48 to be the same in all bins but allowed the @xmath3 and the normalization @xmath47 to differ .",
    "figures  [ fig : cone ] and [ fig : cthree ] show the resulting luminosity functions for the four bands . for each band",
    "we show the early - type , late - type and total lfs for redshift bins of @xmath58 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we show only the non - parametric swml lfs and the result for the global parametric sty fit evaluated at the median of the redshift bin .",
    "table  [ tab : styfit ] presents the parameters for the global sty fits with an evolving @xmath3 , table  [ tab : swmlfit ] presents the schechter function fits to the swml fits for the three redshift bins , and table  [ tab : swml ] presents the tabulated swml lfs .",
    "the sty and swml estimates of the luminosity functions are broadly consistent with each other , although we do find systematic mismatches in some cases ( such as the faint end slope of the total lf in the [ 5.8 ] band with 12@xmath59 offsets ) .",
    "given the flux limits of our survey , we can only determine the full lf parameters in the global fits and the lowest redshift bin .",
    "for the higher redshift bins we only sample the higher luminosity galaxies and can not reliably determine the faint - end slope @xmath48 .",
    "the swml lfs are well fit by the schechter functions with @xmath60 in all cases ( table  [ tab : swmlfit ] ) , which also suggest that the swml method slightly over - estimates the error - bars on the binned lfs .",
    "we can compare our results to several recent mid - ir luminosity function measurements based on spitzer data .",

    "our results at low redshift would be significantly improved by combining our sample with a complete redshift survey of the brighter mid - ir sources in the wider area swire fields , to better constrain the low redshift , high luminosity sources , and with a fainter sample in a narrow field ( e.g. the deep2 results for the extended groth strip ) to better constrain the faint end of the luminosity function and extend the results to higher redshifts . within the botes field itself",

    "the existence of some problems was easily diagnosed by redshift dependent changes in kron radii between bands , and the behavior of aperture versus kron magnitudes .",
    "the cleanest test for evolution is to synthesize metric aperture magnitudes subtending a fixed physical scale , as these should have no redshift dependence if there is no evolution .",
    "we use this method to test whether there are additional corrections needed beyond those discussed in   [ sec : sample ] .",
    "unfortunately , finite metric apertures sample different fractions of galaxies depending on their luminosity ( size ) , so we must model the luminosity dependence while searching for a redshift dependence .",
