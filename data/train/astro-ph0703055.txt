    "multiscale structure in the neutral atomic ism is well known ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a quantitative examination of this structure over a wide range of scales may help us understand its physical causes ( e.g.  turbulent cascades ) , especially if the smaller scales can be probed .",
    "such an examination is usually difficult with  21 cm line observations , due to sightline confusion and sensitivity limits at high resolution .",
    "however ,  and dust should be well mixed in cold gas , so dust may trace  structure at fine scales .",
    "power - spectrum studies of dust infrared emission show power - law behavior similar to  emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and one study of optical dust reflection in cirrus does as well @xcite .    here",
    "i present optical and  maps of the ism associated with the pleiades , where dust grains in a passing cloud are illuminated as a reflection nebula @xcite . since the cluster is nearby ( @xmath1  pc ;",
    "@xcite ) and there is minimal dust in front of the nebula @xcite , optical features are easily related to specific spatial scales .",
    "the nebula s rich optical structure is illustrated in * figures [ fig : schmidt ] & [ fig : wiyn]*.  maps must be interpreted with more caution , since some emission may lie in the background , but the emission shown in * figure [ fig : hi ] * has the same velocity as interstellar absorption associated with the nebula and matches the dust distribution .",
    "each image was run through a 2-d fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm @xcite , and a map of the fft modulus was computed as the quadrature sum of the real and imaginary transform components .",
    "the modulus values were then binned by `` radial frequency '' @xmath2 , and the 2-d angular power spectrum @xmath3 was constructed as the square of the median modulus in each @xmath4 bin .",
    "the median statistic is robust against most artifacts that arise from `` wraparound discontinuities '' between the right and left or top and bottom image edges .",
    "however , the 2 or 3 lowest - frequency bins may still have excess power in some cases , particularly for the wiyn data .",
    "image apodization alleviated this problem for the  maps but did not help with the wiyn data ; the schmidt and hst images produced minimal edge artifacts .",
    "stars were also removed from the wiyn image prior to the fft , so its power spectrum is quite clean aside from edge effects .",
    "no significant stars were present in the hst image .",
    "stars were not removed from the schmidt mosaic , because the total map flux is dominated by the nebulosity near the brightest stars ; however all saturated pixels were replaced by neighbor interpolation .",
    "the power spectra are shown individually in * figures [ fig : schmidt ] - [ fig : hi ] * and together as a composite spectrum in * figure [ fig : big_spectrum]*. angular frequency is measured in cycles per arcsecond .",
    "the dashed lines indicate valid ranges of measurement , particularly where the resolution limits of different data sets occur ; near the resolution frequency , photon noise flattens the wiyn and hst spectra , and  power drops precipitously . over 62% of the large - scale  map is dwingeloo data , so the @xmath5 lab nyquist limit sets the resolution frequency for that spectrum .",
    "all power spectra in * figures [ fig : schmidt ] - [ fig : big_spectrum ] * are plotted against a power law with the same slope of @xmath0 , which was adopted from visual inspection . within the dashed lines ,",
    "most spectra are remarkably consistent with this power law .",
    "this includes the schmidt spectra at scales @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , despite the presence of stars in the image .",
    "the consistency between the wiyn and schmidt spectra here supports both being dominated by nebulosity . at scales",
    "@xmath8 , the schmidt spectrum deviates from the power law , probably because the stellar illumination pattern is becoming more important than dust density structure . for scales larger than the cluster core",
    ", the spectrum flattens in the absence of additional illumination structure .",
    "similar `` illumination bias '' behavior is seen in power spectra of the smooth nebular models of @xcite , at both optical and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the fir model results indicate that , unfortunately , 100  @xmath9 m maps from the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ can not be used to study multiscale structure in the pleiades , because the @xmath10 _ iras _ beam is too close to the illumination scale .",
    "the hst results are surprising .",
    "while some of the long , parallel streamers in the map are probably part of the larger nebular structure visible in the wiyn image , the bright structure in the hst map is from ic  349 , an intense 20@xmath11 clump whose dynamical relation to the larger pleiades nebulosity is debated @xcite .",
    "ic  349 has the appearance of a lumpy , limb - brightened , optically - thick cloud , while most pleiades optical nebulosity resembles smooth , optically - thin filaments .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that ic  349 is typical of nebular structure elsewhere in the pleiades at these scales .",
    "yet the hst power spectrum is quite similar to the wiyn and schmidt spectra .",
    "it is hard to understand this result unless the power spectrum is relatively insensitive to morphology .",
    "the  power spectra are preliminary , as they have not yet been corrected for possible noise contamination .",
    "but if noise is not significant , as is probably true for at least the single - dish data , then the  and dust slopes agree well enough to suggest a single power law for both , even at scales larger than that of the pleiades nebulosity .",
    "this could indicate that the pleiades ism structure is the same as the more general ism , which is consistent with the nebula merely being a chance illumination of ordinary interstellar material . on the other hand",
    ", there is no apparent difference in the slope of single - channel  emission vs.  that integrated over all relevant velocities , which does not agree with the theoretical predictions of @xcite for the general ism . in any case , when combined , all of the pleiades power spectra appear consistent with a single power law over 5 orders of magnitude in angular and physical scale .",
    "near the galactic plane , where dust and  emission are more confused , self - absorption ( hisa ) may serve as a useful cold gas tracer ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a hisa power spectrum investigation is underway .",
    "i would like to thank my long - term pleiades collaborators ken nordsieck and mark holdaway .",
