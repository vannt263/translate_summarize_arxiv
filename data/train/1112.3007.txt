    "recent experimental searches for higgs bosons  @xcite by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite , based on luminosities of up to about 2.3  @xmath0 , have excluded the higgs boson of the standard model , when combined  @xcite , between 141  gev and 476  gev at 95% cl .",
    "atlas and cms have updated several channels using an integrated luminosity of up to 5  @xmath0  @xcite , so that each experiment alone has about the same sensitivity as the combination in the low mass region , raising the low - mass bound of the higgs from the lep2 limit @xcite of 114.4  gev to 115.5/115  gev and leading to an exclusion of the mass from 131  gev/127  gev to 453  gev/600  gev by atlas / cms , respectively .",
    "bounds as low as fractions @xmath1 have been set on the production cross sections with respect to the standard model [ sm ] for some of the masses probed .",
    "given the far reaching consequences , the question arises naturally to what extent higgs bosons , in slightly generalized scenarios , may still exist in this mass region .    on the other hand ,",
    "a gap from about 130  gev down to the low - mass limit of about 115  gev is left , presently , in which a sm - type higgs signal can be expected to either rise up or plunge in the near future  @xcite . when a higgs boson will indeed be discovered in this mass range , the standard - hidden higgs scenario allows to quantify how well the global properties of the particle coincide with the predictions of the standard model .",
    "both these questions have been addressed  @xcite at the theoretical level in a standard - hidden higgs scenario .",
    "the present sequel will include the recent lhc results on the higgs sector in the analysis .",
    "the ground for the fundamental idea to use the higgs boson as a portal to a novel hidden sector in nature has been laid for general model structures in ref .",
    "phenomenological implications  @xcite can then be studied in specific frameworks like hidden valleys  @xcite .",
    "other than the higgs portal there exist two additional portal - type interactions in a renormalizable theory , namely kinetic @xmath2 mixing  @xcite and mixing with sterile neutrinos  @xcite .    the experimentally observed rates depend on the higgs production cross sections and the decay branching ratios  @xcite . in scenarios",
    "in which the standard higgs boson is mixed with another higgs boson , originating from a hidden sector for instance , the production cross sections are reduced universally by the mixing parameter and , in addition , the visible branching ratios may be lowered by decays into invisible channels induced by mixing . throughout this paper",
    "we will consider the minimal standard model higgs sector as the activator of the visible higgs boson  @xcite , but the same arguments trivially hold for extended visible higgs sectors , for example in supersymmetry or other extensions to the standard model  @xcite . in the early theoretical analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite the two effects have been joined properly , expanded here by exploiting data in addition .",
    "specific examples have also been discussed in ref .",
    "the opening of invisible channels has been investigated in several other studies , motivated by a large variety of models ranging from higgs decays to lsp s in supersymmetry @xcite and other sm extensions , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , to phenomenological approaches @xcite , partly connected with cold dark matter analyses  @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of mixing on the production cross sections has often been left aside .",
    "the higgs potential of the standard - hidden higgs system consists of the standard potential in the visible sector and the isomorphic potential in the hidden sector , coupled by a bi - bilinear portal term  @xcite .",
    "vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields build up the higgs mass parameters in the two sectors as well as their coupling .",
    "diagonalizing the standard - hidden higgs mass matrix [ squared ] , generates the mass eigenvalues @xmath3 and rotates the standard - hidden higgs states @xmath4 to the mass eigen - states @xmath5 , @xmath6 the labels ordered parallel to the rising mass values . in the limit of small mixing , @xmath7 approaches the lighter of the states @xmath8 or @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 or @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath12 the heavier of the two primary states .",
    "the mixing reduces the production cross sections of @xmath5 to @xmath13 with respect to the cross sections of the standard model for equivalent masses , the expressions within the curly brackets for @xmath14 substituting the corresponding expressions for @xmath15 .",

    "after factorizing off the mixing parameters , the relevant @xmath9 widths @xmath18 , defined for virtual masses @xmath19 , are generated by the unknown dynamics of the hidden sector .",
    "most agnostically , these width parameters should not exceed the values of the higgs masses , @xmath20 .",

    "likewise the total widths , @xmath26 with @xmath27 for @xmath28 , respectively , are free parameters at the phenomenological level in this scenario .",
    "the search for higgs bosons at the lhc by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite has excluded major parts of the intermediate higgs mass range and beyond  @xcite .",
    "however , it leaves a clear gap down to the low - mass limit set originally by lep2 and improved by atlas / cms to about 115  gev in which a higgs signal may be confirmed or refuted in the coming year  @xcite . in this section",
    "we follow two scenarios .",
    "first , we study higgs sectors with reduced couplings and invisible decay widths , which can naturally explain a missing higgs signal at the lhc . in a second step ,",
    "we describe the effects of a potential higgs discovery in the still open mass window with sm - like couplings .      to begin with",
    ", in the higgs mass range ruled out for standard model couplings , the corresponding higgs cross sections are constrained to values as low as @xmath29 in units of the sm value .",
    "these bounds , as well as production cross sections measured after the discovery of the higgs boson , can be re - interpreted within the standard - hidden higgs scenario . for a given mass value",
    "the bounds induce constraints on the mixing and on the invisible width of @xmath7 , while at the same time the second , heavier state of the higgs pair is proven not to violate the experimental bounds . the bounds on the production cross sections for @xmath7 from any set of final states",

    "for @xmath47 , the @xmath7 and @xmath12 curves cross each other at a positive value of @xmath48 , leaving a blank area between the exclusion contours not covered by either higgs boson .",

    "[ eq : gamh ] , reduced now to equality . in the limit @xmath59 the interpretation of the observed state is unique as the @xmath7 contour in fig .",

    "note that for small mixing the two states @xmath7 and @xmath12 , identified consecutively with the state experimentally observed , approach the same higgs state @xmath8 of the standard model , as pointed out earlier .",
    "thus the sm higgs boson emerges in a model - independent way from the experimental data .",
    "the agreement with the standard model can quantitatively be described by the size of the contour curves approaching the sm corners .    the twin sister of the observed state is difficult to detect experimentally in the sm corner .",
    "if the observed state is identified with @xmath7 , for instance , the production of the higher - mass @xmath12 sister is strongly suppressed in the sm approach for an @xmath7 mass chosen as @xmath62  gev and several @xmath12 masses ; exemplified for a typical set of parameters :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     even for a higgs boson mass of 400  gev , the best combined limit  @xcite at @xmath29 is not yet sensitive .",
    "thus , the properties of @xmath7 must be exploited primarily for studying the nature of the standard - hidden higgs sector .    if the invisible parameter @xmath52 can be measured experimentally , the crossing of the @xmath52 with the @xmath35 contour ,  _ cf . _ fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_disc ] , fixes the two physical parameters at the point marked by the square , @xmath63 for the observed state identified with the higgs state @xmath64 , and correspondingly @xmath34 instead of @xmath33 if the observed state is identified with state @xmath65 .",
    "the result would invite the search for the second higgs boson of the standard - hidden pair in either case .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath33 , the wave function of the higgs boson @xmath7 , given by @xmath10 and @xmath66 , will determine the primary affiliation either with the standard higgs boson @xmath8 or the hidden higgs boson @xmath9 , and complementary for @xmath12 .",
    "note , however , that the nearly parallel running of the @xmath35 and @xmath52 curves for large @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_disc ] renders the measurement of the crossing point experimentally very difficult when the errors on @xmath52 are included .",

    "expanding on earlier theoretical analyses , we have exploited recent lhc data to draw conclusions on the higgs sector in a standard - hidden higgs scenario which develops continuously out of the standard model .",
    "coupling the standard model with a hidden sector suggests an exciting interpretation of the recent experimental data .    ",
    "mixing effects and invisible decays of higgs particles can reduce the cross sections for experimental searches of the higgs boson at the lhc .",
    "though the sm higgs boson may be ruled out for specific mass values , if cross sections fall below the sm predictions , higgs bosons are not excluded _",
    "per se _ for these mass values .",
    "constraints then follow for the mixing of standard and hidden higgs states , as well as for decays into the hidden sector .",
    "such higgs bosons should emerge however with rising lhc luminosity .",
    " if a higgs boson is discovered at the lhc , the standard - hidden higgs scenario allows to quantify how closely the state coincides with or to what extent it deviates from the standard model .",
    "it is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : contsm ] how from present collider parameters such a measurement will rapidly gain sensitivity with increasing luminosity and energy .",
    "thus , the standard - hidden higgs system not only describes an exciting physical scenario , but it can also be adopted for interpreting the data in searches for higgs bosons at the lhc and , if discovered , for the global understanding of their nature .",
