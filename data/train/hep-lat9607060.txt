    "the main result of the present study is a resolution of a puzzle which existed since the middle of 80 s and has been one of the major obstacles towards our understanding of the behavior of qcd at finite baryon density .",
    "the contradiction is simple and acute .",
    "the quark chemical potential @xmath0 in qcd shifts the energy of a given quantum state by @xmath4 times this state s net baryon number .",
    "a transition at @xmath5 should occur when @xmath6 : the vacuum state without baryons is no longer the lowest energy state .",
    "it is believed that the chiral symmetry is restored in the new phase . testing this prediction by monte carlo simulation is difficult since the determinant of the fermion matrix becomes complex at nonzero @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless one can use quenched approximation in this case .",
    "such monte carlo studies @xcite give consistently the critical value of @xmath7  a clearly unphysical result , since the pion does not carry baryon number .",
    "the present study is motivated by a desire to clarify the problem using random matrix approach . on an exactly solvable model of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd",
    "we demonstrate explicitly a general phenomenon related to the nature of the quenched limit .",
    "namely , one can view the quenched theory as a somewhat abstract limit @xmath1 of qcd with variable number @xmath2 of quark flavors .",
    "then if the limit is smooth the quenched theory is a reasonable approximation to the theory at finite @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , this limit is not always smooth and can be different from the quenched theory as , e.g. , in a theory of spin glasses .",
    "we show that the quenched limit is not smooth in qcd at finite @xmath0 .",
    "quenched theory is therefore not a good approximation to full qcd at finite @xmath0 .",
    "this resolves the old contradiction .",
    "moreover , we can describe a theory to which quenched qcd _ is _ a good approximation .",
    "it is a theory ( suggested in @xcite ) in which each quark has a conjugate partner , essentially , with opposite baryon number assignment .",
    "we study analytical properties of the quark condensate @xmath8  the order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking  as a function of the bare quark mass @xmath10 which we allow to go into the complex plane : @xmath11 . integrating out the quark degrees of freedom we can express @xmath8 through the average of the inverse dirac operator @xmath12 : @xmath13 . in the infinite volume the value of the @xmath8 in the chiral limit @xmath14 can be related to the density of small eigenvalues @xmath15 by the banks - casher formula : @xmath16 . to generalize this well - known relation to our case we must consider the density per unit _ area _ of the complex plane : @xmath17 .",
    "the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath18 is straightforward : @xmath19 . viewing @xmath9 as a density of charges and @xmath20 , @xmath21",
    "as components of the electric field strength @xmath22 one easily inverts this relation : @xmath23 the main point here is that @xmath9 vanishes where @xmath18 depends analytically on @xmath24 , the bare quark mass .",
    "for example , when @xmath25 all eigenvalues of @xmath12 lie on the imaginary axis .",
    "this means that @xmath18 has a cut as on fig .",
    "[ fig : n]a .",
    "the discontinuity across the cut is the signature of the chiral symmetry breaking and is given precisely by the banks - casher formula .",
    "now we would like to calculate @xmath18 and @xmath9 .",
    "since we are interested in the density of _ small _ eigenvalues of the dirac operator one can expect that some simplification can be made . indeed , it is by now well understood that these small eigenvalues are related to the zero modes of the dirac operator in the instanton field background .",
    "the behavior of these small eigenvalues is rather universal and can be described by a simple random matrix model @xcite .",
    "we choose chiral representation of the dirac gamma - matrices .",
    "then the matrix of the dirac operator in a certain basis has the block - diagonal form : @xmath26 nonzero entries @xmath27 are approximated by a complex random @xmath28 matrix with a gaussian distribution : @xmath29 . to adapt the model to our case",
    "we add a chemical potential : @xmath30 .",
    "to find @xmath18 one calculates the quenched free energy : @xmath31 and differentiates it with respect to the bare quark mass @xmath24 : @xmath32 .",
    "then @xmath9 is given by : @xmath33    a standard way to deal with the logarithm inside the averaging in ( [ v ] ) is the ` replica trick ' .",
    "one does the calculation for arbitrary number of fermion species @xmath2 : @xmath34 and then takes @xmath35 hoping that the limit is smooth . doing this calculation",
    "we find that , first of all , @xmath18 is a holomorphic function of @xmath24 .",
    "it is given by a solution of a cubic equation : @xmath36 .",
    "it is analytic except for branch points , where 2 solutions coincide , connected by cuts .",
    "the cuts follow lines where the value of @xmath37 $ ] on two solutions coincide .",
    "the physical sheet is determined by an asymptotic condition at @xmath38 : @xmath39 , from the normalization of @xmath9 .",
    "the singularities of @xmath18 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n ] . for @xmath40",
    "the cut is on the imaginary axis . at @xmath41",
    "the branch points bifurcate and the cuts go into the complex plane . above a certain value of @xmath42",
    "the cut no longer goes through @xmath43  there is no discontinuity across the imaginary axis , i.e. , the chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "-6 mm    -4 mm",
    "one can now compare this replica trick calculation to the actual distribution of eigenvalues of the random matrix @xmath12 in the quenched theory .",
    "it is obtained numerically , by plotting the eigenvalues for an ensemble of random matrices ( [ d ] ) on fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] .",
    "first of all , the eigenvalues do not stay on the imaginary axis for any nonzero @xmath0 !",
    "they spread in a blob of the @xmath44-width growing @xmath45 at small @xmath0 .",
    "exactly the same behavior is observed in the quenched qcd calculations @xcite and leads to the puzzling conclusion that @xmath7 and vanishes in the chiral limit @xmath46 because there is no discontinuity in @xmath18 across the imaginary axis when @xmath47 .",
    "now , however , we are able to find the explicit solution of the model and see the nature of this quenched blob .",
    "first of all , we must learn that the limit @xmath1 of qcd with @xmath2 quarks is not smooth and the quenched theory is not a good approximation to the full theory at @xmath47 .",
    "second , we want to know what theory has quenched qcd as its @xmath1 limit .",
    "we find that it is a theory where each quark has a partner with the conjugate dirac operator .",
    "the free energy reads : @xmath48 this statement can be made rigorous even beyond the random matrix approximation using equations ( [ rhov ] ) and : @xmath49 naively , when @xmath1 the conjugate quarks decouple : @xmath50 , and @xmath32 is holomorphic . in fact , the quarks @xmath51 and conjugate quarks @xmath52 mix for some values of parameters @xmath24 and @xmath0 , i.e. , precisely inside the blob",
    ". a condensate @xmath53 develops nonzero vacuum expectation value .",
    "this condensate carries nonzero baryon number .",
    "it was indeed observed in a monte carlo simulation of the @xmath54 theory _ with _ quarks @xcite , which are self - conjugate in that case .",
    "we learn now that similar phenomenon occurs in the quenched theory . calculating ( [ vnn ] )",
    "we find @xcite for the density of eigenvalues inside of the blob : @xmath55 which one can check is in perfect agreement with the numerical data fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] .    -6 mm    -4 mm",
    "using a simple random matrix model of chiral symmetry breaking we demonstrate a general phenomenon that at _ nonzero _ @xmath0 the limit @xmath1 of qcd with @xmath2 quarks is not smooth and does not coincide with the quenched theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the quenched theory is a smooth limit of a theory where each quark has a conjugate partner .",
    "another way of putting this is to notice that the difference between such a theory and qcd with @xmath3 quarks is that the phase of the fermion determinant is omitted in the former .",
    "we learn that the phase of the determinant is extremely important for a simulation of full qcd at finite @xmath0 . without this phase",
    "the result @xmath56 is natural , as happens in quenched qcd .",
    "this is due to the formation of the baryonic condensate , which breaks the ( replica ) chiral symmetry of quarks and conjugate quarks .",
    "the goldstone boson associated with this breaking is the so - called baryonic pion  a bound state of a quark and a conjugate antiquark .",
    "the presence of this particle explains the result @xmath57 .",
