    "the clustering of the large - scale structures ( lss , hereafter ) and its evolution with redshift encode information about the statistical properties of the initial conditions of the universe and the laws governing the gravitational instability processes that determine the growth of primordial density perturbations .",
    "the basic lss statistics , such as the two point - correlation function of the density field , the mass function of galaxy clusters and the halo bias , are frequently employed to quantify the main properties of the lss clustering , thereby providing a handle on the underlying cosmological model .",
    "such basic statistics have played a vital role in establishing the concordance @xmath0cdm scenario by allowing to place tight constraints on its basic cosmological parameters .",
    "furthermore , the standard lss statistics are routinely employed to test not only the key cosmological parameters of the @xmath4cdm cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) but also the viability of alternative cosmological models , such as e.g. the warm dark matter model ( wdm , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the coupled dark energy scenario ( cde , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and various modified gravity theories ( mg , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main motivation behind most of these alternative models was to overcome the observational and theoretical shortcomings of the @xmath4cdm cosmology .",
    "for instance , the free - streaming effect of the wdm particles has been invoked as a possible solution to the tension between the @xmath4cdm predictions and astrophysical observations on ( sub-)galactic scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , even though recent constraints from the lyman - alpha forest seem to exclude the wdm particle mass range required to address the tension @xcite .",
    "similarly , the dark sector interactions that characterise the cde scenario can alleviate the fine - tuning problems of the cosmological constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while possible large - scale deviations of the laws of gravity from their standard gr form can accommodate the present acceleration of the universe without requiring dark energy with negative pressure ( for a comprehensive review , see * ? ? ?",
    "however , some cautionary remarks have been recently raised on the rosy prospects for the basic statistics of lss as a powerful discriminator of alternative cosmologies .",
    "@xcite theoretically proved that the wdm , cde and mg models are hard to be differentiated from one another just by tracing the expansion and growth history with lss observations .",
    "additionally , it was shown that the presence of a cosmological background of massive neutrinos might significantly suppress the main observational footprints of various cde and mg models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    such early predictions based on linear observables have been recently confirmed and extended to the non - linear regime of structure formation by @xcite , who studied the simultaneous effect on structure formation of a @xmath1 mg model and of massive neutrinos ( the  @xmath5 \" model , hereafter ) by means of large @xmath6-body simulations .",
    "the @xmath1 gravity is one of the viable and most widely investigated mg theories ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) where the ricci scalar @xmath7 is replaced by a function @xmath1 in the einstein - hilbert action . with suitable choices of such function",
    ", the model can be tuned to match the same expansion history of the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the derivative of the @xmath8 function @xmath9  which represents an additional degree of freedom called  the scalaron \"  is expected to mediate a _",
    "fifth - force _ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , implying that the evolution of density perturbations will be different as compared to @xmath0cdm even for an identical expansion history .",
    "the viability of the model is ensured by the chameleon screening mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that allows to recover the behaviour of standard gr in overdense regions of the universe .    in their recent work",
    ", @xcite noted that for a given @xmath1 model there is a specific value of the total neutrino mass @xmath10 that cancels the effects of the modified gravity in most of the standard basic lss observables , thereby yielding  besides an identical expansion history  also the same lss statistics as @xmath4cdm at the present level of observational accuracy .",
    "in other words , the free - streaming effect of massive neutrinos @xcite effectively cancels out that of the fifth - force of the @xmath1 gravity on the large scale structure .",
    "calling it a  cosmic degeneracy \" ,",
    "@xcite regarded this result as an indication of the fundamental limitation of the basic statistics of lss as a test of alternative cosmologies , concluding that some novel independent statistics or some other independent constraints ( as e.g. a laboratory determination of the neutrino mass ) are necessary to break the degeneracy .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite have recently developed a new diagnostic based on the filamentary cosmic web for testing gravity at large scales .",
    "such new approach has shown that the filamentary pattern of the cosmic web is significantly affected by deviations from the standard gravitational behaviour , either in terms of mg or cde models .",
    "more specifically , considering the supercluster spines ( i.e. the main stems of the superclusters ) as the richest filamentary structures in the cosmic web , @xcite determined their specific sizes to quantify the degree of the straightness of the superclusters , finding that the specific size distributions of the supercluster spines substantially differ among various cde models ( see again * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying it being indeed a good indicator of cde",
    ". similarly , in a subsequent paper @xcite also investigated the effect of @xmath1 gravity on the specific sizes of the supercluster spines and showed that the evolution trends of the specific size distributions of the superclusters differ between the cde and the @xmath1 gravity models , which indicated that this new diagnostic is in principle capable of breaking the degeneracy between the two models .    in the light of the works of @xcite and @xcite , in the present study",
    "we aim to explore whether the the degree of the straightness of the superclusters quantified by the specific size of the supercluster spines can be also useful for breaking the cosmic degeneracy between the @xmath4cdm and the @xmath5 models . in section [ sec : data ] we will describe how the supercluster samples are obtained from the simulation datasets obtained from the work of @xcite . in section [ sec : result ] we will show how the specific sizes of the supercluster spines are affected by the simultaneous effects of the @xmath1 gravity and the massive neutrinos . in section [ sec : con ]",
    "we discuss the implications of our results as well as possible prospects for future further improvements .",
    "@xcite carried out large n - body simulations for the standard gr+@xmath4cdm and also for a @xmath1 mg model with four possible different values of the total neutrino mass @xmath2 , namely @xmath11 ev .",
    "the specific @xmath1 model considered in the simulations corresponds to the widely investigated parameterization by @xcite , for @xmath12 and for a scalar amplitude at the present epoch of @xmath13 .",
    "although recent observations indicate @xmath14 on the cluster scale ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such a large value of @xmath15 was chosen on purpose in order to maximize the effects of mg and to emphasize how even for large deviations from standard gr the cosmic degeneracy between @xmath1 and massive neutrinos can very effectively suppress the observational signatures of both non - standard models .",
    "furthermore , the above - mentioned observational constraints on @xmath1 gravity have been derived assuming massless neutrinos , and might therefore become looser ( again as a result of the degeneracy between mg and massive neutrinos ) if the total neutrino mass is allowed to vary as a free parameter .",
    "the simulations have been carried out by means of a suitable combination of the mg - gadget code by @xcite ( specifically designed for mg cosmologies ) and of the particle - based implementation of massive neutrinos by @xcite .",
    "both algorithms are independent modules of the widely - used treepm n - body code gadget @xcite .",
    "with such combined code at hand , @xcite followed the evolution of a cosmological volume of @xmath16 gpc@xmath17 filled with @xmath18 particles for the cdm and neutrino components , with standard cosmological parameters consistent with the latest results of the planck satellite mission @xcite , from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "a catalog of cdm particle groups has been compiled on - the - fly for several different redshifts by means of a standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking length set to the conventional value of @xmath21 of the mean inter - particle separation . for a more detailed description of the simulations ,",
    "we refer the interested reader to the @xcite paper .    from the cluster - size halos selected from the fof catalogs at three different epochs ( @xmath22 ) , we extract the superclusters following the approach described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first of all , a sample of the cluster - size halos is generated by choosing those fof halos with masses above a lower threshold of @xmath23 , at each redshift and for each model .",
    "the mean separation distance among such cluster - size halos is then calculated and the marginally - bound superclusters are identified by running again a fof group finder on the positions of the cluster - size halos with the linking length parameter of @xmath24 the mean inter - halo separation . finally , by binning the halo mass range of the two catalogs and calculating their number densities within each mass bin , we determine both the cluster and the supercluster mass functions .",
    "the top and the bottom panels of figure [ fig : mf ] show , respectively , the cluster and the supercluster mass functions at @xmath20 for all the five models under investigation .",
    "as can be clearly seen in the plots , a lower value of @xmath2 generally exhibits a higher number density of high - mass superclusters ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "note also that both the cluster and the supercluster mass functions for the @xmath4cdm model are almost identical to those for the f4+@xmath26 model ( red dot - dashed line ) , which indicates that the neutrino mass required to cancel out the effect of the fifth force on both observables is of about @xmath27ev .",
    "this result is in full agreement with the findings of @xcite that the standard lss statistics including the cluster mass functions are not capable of discriminating the @xmath4cdm model from the f4+@xmath26 model .",
    "we analyze the supercluster sample for each model at each redshift to determine the mean specific sizes of the supercluster spines , by the prescriptions described in @xcite and @xcite :    * apply the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) algorithm @xcite to the supercluster sample from the simulations of @xcite to determine a mst of each supercluster . * from each supercluster mst , prune away repeatedly the minor twigs having less than three nodes until the main stem of each supercluster ( i.e. the  supercluster spine \" ) is determined and count the number of halos belonging to the main stem ( i.e. the  supercluster nodes \" ) .",
    "* select only those superclusters whose spines consist of three or more nodes . *",
    "find a cuboid which fits the spatial distribution of the nodes of each supercluster spine and measure the length of its diagonal line as the size of each supercluster spine ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* determine the specific size ( @xmath29 ) of each supercluster spine by dividing the size by the node number ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the supercluster spines whose shapes are closer to straight filaments are expected to have larger specific sizes . *",
    "calculate the mean value of @xmath29 averaged over all supercluster spines .",
    "figure [ fig : ssize ] shows the mean specific sizes @xmath31 of the supercluster spines for the different cosmological models under investigation .",
    "the errors are calculated as one standard deviation in the measurement of the mean value .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is shown to monotonically increase as the value of @xmath32 increases from @xmath33 to @xmath34ev .",
    "interestingly , it is not the f4+@xmath26 model but the f4+@xmath35 model which predicts almost the same @xmath31 as the @xmath4cdm cosmology .",
    "in fact , between the @xmath4cdm and the f4+@xmath26 we find a statistically significant difference in the value of @xmath31 . given that for the standard lss statistics",
    "@xcite found that the f4+@xmath26 model appears to be hardly distinguishable from the gr+@xmath4cdm standard scenario , our results indicate that the value of @xmath2 required to compensate for the effect of the fifth force on the specific sizes of the supercluster spines and on the basic statistics of lss are different from each other .",
    "this result leads us to expect that it may be possible to break the cosmic degeneracy between the gr+@xmath4cdm and the f4+@xmath28 models if the basic statistics of lss are combined with the specific size distribution of the supercluster spines .",
    "figure [ fig : ssevol ] displays the mean specific sizes of the supercluster spines versus redshifts for the five models . as for the previous figures",
    ", the ( red ) dot - dashed line corresponds to the _ most degenerate _ combination of the models in the standard lss statistics ( as found by * ? ? ?",
    "as the plot shows , the difference in @xmath31 among the fives models becomes larger at higher redshifts , which is consistent with the result of @xcite who showed that the effect of @xmath1 gravity on the specific size distribution becomes larger at higher redshifts , and this trend appears in all the models under investigation .",
    "the f4+@xmath36 model exhibits the most rapid evolution of @xmath31 , which implies that for more massive neutrinos the free streaming has a stronger effect of sharpening the filamentary structures when they were more energetic at higher redshifts .",
    "in other words , although it is impossible to distinguish between the gr+@xmath4cdm and the f4+@xmath35 models by measuring @xmath31 at the present epoch , this degeneracy is broken by looking at higher redshifts .",
    "more specifically , it appears possible in principle to distinguish the two models by comparing the value of @xmath31 at @xmath3 when the f4+@xmath35 model significantly deviates from the gr+@xmath4cdm standard case .",
    "this work has been inspired by two recent publications . on one hand",
    ", the work of @xcite demonstrated that the specific size of the supercluster spine is a powerful diagnostic not only for detecting any @xmath1 modification of gravity but also for distinguishing the effects of @xmath1 gravity from that of the presence of interacting dark energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent work of @xcite raised for the first time a cosmic degeneracy problem consisting in the fact that the basic statistics of lss ( such as e.g. the cluster mass function , the two - point correlation function of the density field and the halo bias ) might inherently fail to distinguish a suitable combination of a @xmath1 mg model and of a specific value of the total mass of neutrinos from the standard @xmath4cdm cosmology , since the free streaming effect of massive neutrinos effectively suppresses the extra clustering effect associated with the scalar fifth - force of @xmath1 gravity .    using the numerical data from the n - body simulations carried out by @xcite and the techniques developed by @xcite",
    ", we have determined the mean specific sizes of the supercluster spines at three different redshifts ( @xmath22 ) for an @xmath1 gravity cosmology with different values of the total neutrino mass .",
    "our investigation showed that the neutrino mass required to maximally suppress the effects of the mg fifth force on the specific size distribution of the supercluster spines at @xmath20 is different from the value that determines the maximum degeneracy for the basic statistics of lss .",
    "furthermore , we have also found that at higher redshifts all the considered combined models show larger differences in the mean specific size of the supercluster spine from the standard gr+@xmath4cdm cosmology .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the evolution of the specific size of the supercluster spine can in principle play a crucial role in breaking the cosmic degeneracy highlighted by @xcite .",
    "although such conclusion emerges clearly from the present study , a more thorough investigation of the power of the supercluster spines in breaking the mg - massive neutrinos degeneracy will be required in order to quantify precisely the gain of discriminating power obtained by combining this new statistics with the standard lss probes .",
    "first of all , the datasets employed for our analysis were obtained from a suite of intermediate - resolution @xmath6-body simulations . since the identification of the superclusters  especially at high redshifts  is likely to be affected by the resolution of the original @xmath6-body realization , a new set of halo catalogs from higher resolution simulations",
    "is required to examine more carefully how the mean specific sizes of the supercluster spines evolve with redshifts . secondly ,",
    "in the current work we have considered only the case of a rather  extreme \" ( although still possibly consistent with standard lss data for a reasonable value of the neutrino mass ) @xmath1 scenario , namely @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to examine whether the specific size of the supercluster spine is capable of breaking the cosmic degeneracy even for the more challenging case of less severe deviations from the standard gr gravity .",
    "second of all , our conclusion is based not on a realistic observational error but only on the statistical significance of the differences in the mean specific size of the superclusters spine among the models .",
    "it will be essential to estimate an observational confidence region around the fiducial model for the specific size of the supercluster , as @xcite did for the lss statistics .",
    "another direction in which some improvements are needed is the development of an analytic model for the mean specific size of the supercluster spine .",
    "one of the reasons why the basic lss statistics have been so widely employed as a test for cosmology is that they can be analytically ( or semi - analytically ) predicted . on the contrary ,",
    "the mean specific sizes of the supercluster spines have so far been only numerically determined , without being guided by any analytic prescription , which is an obvious drawback that has to be overcome for its practical application in the future .",
    "we leave these three main extensions of our analysis for future work .",
