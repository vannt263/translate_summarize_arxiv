    "a well - known long standing problem in combinatorics and statistical mechanics is to find the generating function for self - avoiding polygons ( or walks ) on a two - dimensional lattice , enumerated by perimeter .",
    "recently , we have gained a greater understanding of the difficulty of this problem , as rechnitzer @xcite has proved that the ( anisotropic ) generating function for square lattice self - avoiding polygons is not differentiably finite @xcite , as had been conjectured earlier on numerical grounds @xcite .",
    "that is to say , it can not be expressed as the solution of an ordinary differential equation with polynomial coefficients .",
    "there are many simplifications of this problem that are solvable @xcite , but all the simpler models impose an effective directedness or equivalent constraint that reduces the problem , in essence , to a one - dimensional problem .",
    "examples of the types of polygons studied in this paper . ]",
    "a staircase polygon can be viewed as the intersection of two directed walks starting at the origin , moving only to the right or up and terminating once the walks join at a vertex .",
    "it is well - known that the generating function for staircase polygons is @xmath0 where the connective constant @xmath1 and the critical exponent @xmath2 .",
    "punctured staircase polygons @xcite are staircase polygons with internal holes which are also staircase polygons ( the polygons are mutually- as well as self - avoiding ) . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that the connective constant @xmath3 of @xmath4-punctured polygons ( polygons with @xmath4 holes ) is the same as the connective constant of unpunctured polygons .",
    "numerical evidence clearly indicated that the critical exponent @xmath5 increased by @xmath6 per puncture .",
    "the closely related model of punctured discs was considered in @xcite .",
    "punctured discs are counted by area and in this case it was proved that the critical exponent increases by 1 per puncture . here",
    "we will study only the case with a _",
    "hole ( see figure  [ fig : poly ] ) , and we will refer to these objects as punctured staircase polygons .",
    "the perimeter length of staircase polygons is even and thus the total perimeter ( the outer perimeter plus the perimeter of the hole ) is also even .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the number of punctured staircase polygons of perimeter @xmath8 .",
    "the results of @xcite imply that the half - perimeter generating function has a simple pole at @xmath9 , though the analysis in @xcite clearly indicated that the critical behaviour is more complicated than a simple algebraic singularity .",
    "recently we found that the perimeter generating function of three - choice polygons can be expressed as the solution of an 8th order linear ode @xcite .",
    "similarly , in this paper we report on work which has led to an exact fuchsian linear differential equation of order 8 apparently satisfied by the perimeter generating function , @xmath10 , for punctured staircase polygons ( that is , @xmath11 is one of the solutions of the ode , expanded around the origin ) .",
    "the first few terms in the generating function are @xmath12 our analysis of the ode shows that the dominant singular behaviour is @xmath13 so in the notation used above , the generating function has a dominant singularity at @xmath14 with exponent @xmath15 .",
    "this result confirms exactly the conjecture for the critical exponent @xcite in the case of a single puncture and the quite complicated corrections at the critical point explains why the analysis in @xcite , based on a relatively short series , was so difficult .",
    "it is also possible to express the generating function @xmath11 as a sum of @xmath16 gessel - viennot determinants @xcite .",
    "this is clear from figure [ fig : gv ] , where the enumeration of the lattice paths between the dotted lines is just the classical problem of 4 vicious walkers , and these must be joined to two vicious walkers to the left , and to two vicious walkers to the right",
    ". then one must sum over different possible geometries .",
    "however the fact that the generating function is so expressible implies that it is differentiably finite @xcite .     the decomposition of a punctured staircase polygon into a sequence of 2 - 4 - 2 vicious walkers , each expressible as a gessel - viennot determinant ]    unfortunately we",
    "can not readily bound the size of the underlying ode , otherwise we could use this observation to provide a proof of our results .",
    "as it is , we originally generated the counts of punctured staircase polygons up to perimeter 502 ( 251 coefficients ) , and found what we believe to be the underlying ode experimentally from the first 195 coefficients .",
    "the ode then correctly predicts the next 56 coefficients .",
    "while the possibility that the underlying ode is not the correct one is extraordinarily small , our procedure still does not constitute a proof of course .",
    "we have since extended the count beyond perimeter 800 and still all coefficients are predicted by our ode .",
    "the algorithm we use to count the number punctured staircase polygons is a modified version of the algorithm of conway @xcite for the enumeration of imperfect staircase polygons .",
    "the two problems are very similar and consequently there are only minor differences between the algorithms .",
    "a detailed description of the algorithm we used to count imperfect staircase polygons can be found in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on transfer matrix techniques .",
    "this entails bisecting the polygons by a line ( as illustrated in figure  [ fig : poly ] ) and enumerating the number of polygons by moving the line ` forward ' one step at a time .",
    "punctured staircase polygons start out as ordinary staircase polygons and the line bisects the polygon at two edges . then at some vertex",
    "two additional directed walks ( sharing the same starting point ) are inserted between the two original walks .",
    "the line will thus intersect these polygon configurations at four edges ( see figure  [ fig : poly ] ) .",
    "the only difference between the algorithm in @xcite and the one used for this paper is in how the four directed walks intersected by the line are connected in order to produce a valid polygon . to produce a punctured staircase polygon",
    "we first connect the two innermost walks and then the two outermost walks are connected .",
    "imperfect staircase polygons on the other hand are produced by connecting the first walk with the second walk and the third walks with the fourth walk .",
    "the updating rules used to count imperfect staircase polygons are given in @xcite and are easily amended to count punctured staircase polygons bearing in mind the different ` closing ' criteria outlined above .",
    "we calculated the number of punctured staircase polygons up to perimeter 502 .",
    "the integer coefficients become very large so the calculation was performed using modular arithmetic @xcite .",
    "this involves performing the calculation _ modulo _ various prime numbers @xmath17 and then reconstructing the full integer coefficients at the end .",
    "we used primes of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are small positive integers , less than @xmath20 chosen so that @xmath17 is prime , and @xmath21 unless @xmath22 17 primes were needed to represent the coefficients correctly .",
    "the calculation for each prime used about 200 mb of memory and about 8 minutes of cpu time on a 2.8 ghz xeon processor .",
    "naturally we could have carried the calculation much further ( and we have since done this ) but as we shall demonstrate in the next section this number of coefficients more than sufficed to identify an exact differential equation satisfied by @xmath11 .",
    "in recent papers zenine _ et al _ @xcite obtained the linear differential equations whose solutions give the 3- and 4-particle contributions @xmath23 and @xmath24 to the ising model susceptibility .",
    "in @xcite we used their method to find a linear differential equation for three - choice polygons and in this paper we extend this work further to find a linear differential equation which has as a solution the generating function @xmath11 for punctured staircase polygons .",
    "we briefly outline the method here . starting from a ( long ) series expansion for the function",
    "@xmath11 we look for a linear differential equation of order @xmath25 of the form    @xmath26    such that @xmath11 is a solution to this homogeneous linear differential equation , where the @xmath27 are polynomials . in order to make it as simple as possible we start by searching for a fuchsian @xcite equation .",
    "such equations have only regular singular points .",
    "there are several reasons for searching for a fuchsian equation , rather than a more general d - finite equation .",
    "computationally the fuchsian assumption simplifies the search for a solution . > from the general theory of fuchsian @xcite equations it follows that the degree of @xmath27 is at most @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the degree of @xmath30 . to simplify matters",
    "further ( reduce the order of the unknown polynomials ) it is advantageous to explicitly assume that the origin and @xmath31 are regular singular points and set @xmath32 , where @xmath33",
    ". thus when searching for a solution of fuchsian type there are only two parameters , namely the order @xmath25 of the differential equation and the degree @xmath34 of the polynomial @xmath35 .",
    "one may also argue , less precisely , that for `` sensible '' combinatorial models one would expect fuchsian equations , as irregular singular points are characterized by explosive , super - exponential behaviour .",
    "such behaviour is not normally characteristic of combinatorial problems arising from statistical mechanics .",
    "the point at infinity may be an exception to this somewhat imprecise observation .",
    "we then search systematically for solutions by varying @xmath25 and @xmath34 . in this way we first found a solution with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which required the determination of @xmath38 unknown coefficients .",
    "we have 251 terms in the half - perimeter series and thus have 56 additional terms with which to check the correctness of our solution . having found this solution we then turned the ode into a recurrence relation and used this to generate more series terms in order to search for a lower order fuchsian equation .",
    "the lowest order equation we found was eighth order and with @xmath39 , which requires the determination of @xmath40 unknown coefficients .",
    "thus from our original 251 term series we could not have found this @xmath41 order solution since we did not have enough terms to determine all the unknown coefficients in the ode .",
    "this raises the question as to whether perhaps there is an ode of lower order than 8 that generates the coefficients ?",
    "the short answer to this is no .",
    "further study of our differential operator revealed that it can be factorised .",
    "in fact we found a factorization into three first - order linear operators , a second order and a third order .",
    "the generating function is a solution of the @xmath41 order operator , not of any of the smaller factors .",
    "the ( half)-perimeter generating function @xmath11 for punctured staircase polygons is a solution to the linear differential equation of order 8    @xmath42    with    @xmath43    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , are polynomials of degree 22 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 31 , 31 , 31 , and 31 , respectively .",
    "the polynomials are listed in [ app : pppol ] .",
    "the singular points of the differential equation are given by the roots of @xmath48 .",
    "one can easily check that all the singularities ( including @xmath49 ) are _ regular singular points _",
    "so equation ( [ eq : ppfde ] ) is indeed of the fuchsian type .",
    "it is thus possible using the method of frobenius to obtain from the indicial equation the critical exponents at the singular points .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : ppexp ] .",
    "singularity & exponents + @xmath50 & @xmath51 + @xmath52 & @xmath53 , @xmath54 + @xmath55 & @xmath56 + @xmath57 & @xmath56 + @xmath58 & @xmath59 + @xmath60 & @xmath61 + @xmath62 & @xmath63 +    we shall now consider the local solutions to the differential equation around each singularity . recall that in general it is known @xcite that if the indicial equation yields @xmath4 critical exponents which differ by an integer , then the local solutions _ may _ contain logarithmic terms up to @xmath64 .",
    "however , for the fuchsian equation ( [ eq : ppfde ] ) _ only _ multiple roots of the indicial equation give rise to logarithmic terms in the local solution around a given singularity , so that a root of multiplicity @xmath4 gives rise to logarithmic terms up to @xmath64 .",
    "in particular this means that near any of the 22 roots of @xmath44 the local solutions have no logarithmic terms and the solutions are thus _ analytic _ since all the exponents are positive integers .",
    "the roots of @xmath65 are thus _ apparent singularities _ @xcite of the fuchsian equation ( [ eq : ppfde ] ) .",
    "we briefly mention that as in our earlier study @xcite we can find a solution of order 14 of the same form as ( [ eq : ppfde ] ) but with @xmath66 being just a constant .",
    "so at this order none of the roots of @xmath44 appear . clearly any real singularity of the system can not be made to vanish and so we conclude that the 22 roots of @xmath65 must indeed be apparent singularities .    assuming that only repeated roots give rise to @xmath67-terms , and thus that a sequence of positive integers give rise to _",
    "analytic _ terms , then near the physical critical point @xmath68 we expect the singular behaviour @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath73",
    ". note that the terms associated with the exponents @xmath74 and @xmath6 become part of the analytic correction to the @xmath75 term . near the singularity on the negative @xmath76-axis , @xmath77 we expect the singular behaviour @xmath78 where again @xmath79 is analytic near @xmath80 .",
    "we expect similar behaviour near the pair of singularities @xmath81 , and finally at the roots of @xmath82 we expect the behaviour @xmath83 .",
    "we can simplify the @xmath41 order differential operator found above .",
    "we first found three very simple solutions of the ode , each corresponding to an order one differential operator , @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 the existense of these three linearly independent solutions implies that we can find three first order operators , which we denote by @xmath87 with @xmath88 1,2,3 , such that the original 8th order differential operator can be written as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a fifth order differential operator .",
    "we further found that this latter operator is decomposable as @xmath91 .",
    "this then allows one , in principle , to write down the form of the @xmath92 matrix representing the differential galois group of @xmath93 , in an appropriate global solution basis . to determine the asymptotics one would need to calculate non - local connection matrices between solutions at different points",
    "this is a huge task for such a large differential operator .",
    "instead , we have developed a numerical technique that avoids all these difficulties , which we describe below .",
    "to standardise our asymptotic analysis , we assume that the critical point is at 1 .",
    "the growth constant of punctured staircase staircase polygons is 4 , so we normalise the series by considering the new series with coefficients @xmath94 , defined by @xmath95 thus the generating function we study is @xmath96 . using the recurrence relations for @xmath7 ( derived from the ode )",
    "it is easy and fast to generate many more terms @xmath94 .",
    "we generated the first 100000 terms and saved them as floats with 500 digit accuracy ( this calculation took less than 15 minutes ) .",
    "> from equations ( [ eq : xc ] ) and ( [ eq : xm ] ) it follows that the asymptotic form of the coefficients is @xmath97{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{r}}}(y ) = r_n = \\sum_{i \\ge 0 } \\left ( \\frac{\\tilde{a}_i}{n^i}\\!+ \\!\\frac{\\tilde{b}_i\\log{n } \\!+\\ ! \\tilde{c}_i}{n^{i+1/2 } } \\!+\\ ! ( -1)^n\\left ( \\frac{\\tilde{d}_i}{n^{15/2+i } } \\right)\\ !",
    "\\right ) + { \\rm o}(\\lambda^{-n}).\\ ] ] any contributions from the other singularities are exponentially suppressed since their norm ( in the scaled variable @xmath98 ) exceeds 1 .",
    "estimates for the amplitudes were obtained by fitting @xmath94 to the form given above using an increasing number of amplitudes . ` experimentally ' we find we need about the same total number of terms at @xmath73 and @xmath99 .",
    "so in the fits we used the terms with amplitudes @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 . going only to @xmath106 with the @xmath104 amplitudes results in much poorer convergence and going beyond @xmath107 leads to no improvement . for a given @xmath106 we thus have to estimate @xmath108 unknown amplitudes .",
    "so we use the last @xmath108 terms @xmath94 with @xmath29 ranging from 100000 to @xmath109 and solve the resulting @xmath108 system of linear equations .",
    "we can also add extra terms to the asymptotic form and check what happens to the amplitudes of the new terms .",
    "if these amplitudes are very small it is highly likely that the terms are not truly present ( if the calculation could be done exactly these amplitudes would be zero ) .    doing this we found that all the amplitudes @xmath100 appear to be zero except that @xmath110 , e.g. , with @xmath111 we find that the estimates for the amplitudes @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , etc .",
    "so in all likelihood the amplitudes @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "this then leads us to the refined asymptotic form @xmath117{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{r}}}(y ) = r_n = 1024\\left ( 1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{i \\ge 0 } \\left ( \\frac{b_i\\log{n } + c_i}{n^{i } } + ( -1)^n\\left ( \\frac{d_i}{n^{7+i } } \\right ) \\right ) \\right ) + { \\rm o}(\\lambda^{-n}).\\ ] ] in fits to this form we then used the terms with amplitudes @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , @xmath103 and @xmath120 , @xmath121 . for a given @xmath106 we thus have to estimate @xmath122 unknown amplitudes .",
    "we find that the amplitude estimates are fairly accurate up to around @xmath123 .",
    "we observed this by doing the calculation with @xmath124 and @xmath125 and then looking at the difference in the amplitude estimates . for @xmath126 and @xmath127 the difference is less than @xmath128 , while for @xmath129 the difference is less than @xmath130 . each time we increase the amplitude index by 1",
    "we lose around six significant digits in accuracy . with @xmath131",
    "the differences are respectively around @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "> from our very long series it is possible to obtain accurate numerical estimates of many of the amplitudes @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , with a precision of more than 100 digits for the dominant amplitudes , shrinking to around 10 digits for the the case when @xmath134 ( actually we could probably have pushed this further but there would be little point ) . in this way we found that @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139,@xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , though we have not been able to identify @xmath127 . these amplitudes are known to at least 100 digits accuracy .",
    "the excellent convergence is solid evidence ( though naturally not a proof ) that the assumptions leading to equation  ( [ eq : asymp ] ) are correct .",
    "further evidence was obtained as follows : we have already argued that the terms of the form @xmath144 , @xmath116 are absent .",
    "we found similar results if we added terms like @xmath145 , @xmath146 or additional @xmath147 terms at @xmath148 .",
    "so this fitting procedure provides convincing evidence that the asymptotic form ( [ eq : asymptrue ] ) , and thus the assumptions leading to this formula , are correct .",
    "we have developed an improved algorithm for enumerating punctured staircase polygons .",
    "the extended series , coupled with a search program that assumes the solution is a _ fuchsian _",
    "ode , enabled us to discover the underlying ode , which was of @xmath149 order .",
    "we did this without using 56 of the coefficients that we had generated .",
    "that is to say , 56 of the known coefficients were unused , and so their values provided a check on the solution .",
    "this leads us to believe that we have found the correct ode , as it reproduces the known , unused coefficients .",
    "subsequently we have extended this check to more than 200 unused coefficients .",
    "further refinement allowed us to find an @xmath41 order ode .    a numerical technique we have developed specifically for such problems then allowed us to find accurate numerical estimates for the amplitudes of the first several terms in the asymptotic form of the coefficients , and then to conjecture their exact value .",
    "we have also initiated an investigation of the _ area _ generating function .",
    "we expect this to involve @xmath150-series , and thus far our investigations only lead us to believe that the area generating function @xmath151 is of the form @xmath152,\\ ] ] where @xmath153 is a @xmath150-generalisation of the bessel function , and occurs , for example , in the solution of the problem of staircase polygons enumerated by perimeter @xcite . here",
    "@xmath154 is the first zero of @xmath155 , and @xmath156 and @xmath157 are regular in the neighbourhood of @xmath158 the coefficients thus behave asymptotically as @xmath159a(q ) \\sim const .",
    "\\eta^{-n}n.\\ ] ] in a subsequent publication we propose to investigate the area generating function more fully , and hopefully obtain more insight into the properties of the ode we have found for the perimeter generating function .",
    "furthermore in work with c. richard @xcite we have conjectured the scaling function for punctured polygons with an arbitrary number of punctures .",
    "we briefly review the properties of the two - variable area - perimeter generating function for staircase polygons . of special interest",
    "is the point @xmath160 where two lines of singularities meet .",
    "the behaviour of the singular part of the generating function about @xmath160 is expected to take the special form @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a _ scaling function _ of combined argument @xmath163 , commonly assumed to be regular at the origin , and @xmath164 and @xmath165 are _ critical exponents_. for staircase polygons , we have @xmath166 in @xcite we assumed that the limit distribution by area of staircase polygons with @xmath167 punctures ( of arbitrary size ) is that of staircase polygons with @xmath167 holes of unit area . from this and knowledge of @xmath162",
    "we then obtained _ exact _",
    "predictions for @xmath167 punctured staircase polygons by taking the @xmath167-th derivative w.r.t @xmath150 of @xmath168 .",
    "we then study the area - moment generating function , @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the number of polygons with perimeter @xmath25 and area @xmath29 .",
    "in particular we find that the leading amplitudes @xmath171 of the perimeter generating function of the @xmath4-th area - moment are given by @xmath172 here @xmath173 are amplitudes occuring in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath168 ( these are known exactly for punctured staircase polygons ) while @xmath174 are the critical exponents of the @xmath4th area - moment of @xmath167 punctured polygons .",
    "these predictions have been confirmed for once punctured staircase polygons to a very high level of accuracy for moments up to @xmath175 .",
