    "gw  vir variables belong to the spectroscopic class of the pg  1159 stars ( wesemael , green & liebert 1985 ) , which is named after the prototype pg  1159@xmath0035 .",
    "these objects are strongly hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars which pass through the hottest stage of stellar evolution .",
    "their effective temperatures range between 75  000 and 200  000k , surface gravities vary from @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "the so - called born - again scenario ( a late thermal pulse which transferred these objects back to the agb followed by a second post - agb evolution , iben et al .",
    "1983 ) is mainly accepted as an explanation for the h - deficiency and can reproduce well the observed abundances .",
    "pg  1159 stars have spectra which are dominated by lines of , , and ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) , their atmospheres show a typical surface composition of he : c : o = 33:50:17 by mass . beside these main constituents",
    "there are several lines of trace elements , such as neon , nitrogen , silicon , sulfur , phosphorus , and fluorine ( reiff et al .",
    "2005 , werner et al . 2005 ) .",
    "presently 37 pg  1159 stars are known , eleven of them proved to be pulsators .",
    "the pulsating members of the pg  1159 class are referred as gw  vir variables .",
    "they are non - radial g - mode pulsators with periods from 300s up to 1000s , in some cases exceeding even 2000s ( nagel & werner 2004 ) .",
    "the favored excitation mechanism for the pulsations is the @xmath2-mechanism associated with cyclic ionization of carbon and oxygen ( quirion , fontaine & brassard 2004 ) . in the @xmath3 diagram the gw  vir variables are located among the pg  1159 stars in the so - called gw  vir instability strip .",
    "spectral analyses of pulsating and non - pulsating pg  1159 stars were used by dreizler & heber ( 1998 ) to define empirically the edges of this instability strip .",
    "but it is still puzzling that also non - pulsating pg  1159 stars are located within the instability strip . in our analysis",
    "we try to find more characteristic properties to distinguish between pulsating and non - pulsating members of this class .",
    "for our analysis we selected pulsating and non - pulsating pg1159 stars for which high resolution ( r @xmath4 20  000 ) fuv spectra obtained with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) are available .",
    "the resulting sample comprises eleven objects .",
    "the fuse spectra are processed within the standard calfuse pipeline process .",
    "a log of all observations used for this analysis is listed in table [ tab : log ] . besides the fuv spectra we also used spectra obtained with stis , ghrs and iue as well as optical spectra .",
    "the model atmospheres and synthetic line profiles are computed with the tbingen model atmosphere package ( werner et al .",
    "2003 , rauch & deetjen 2003 ) .",
    "the line - blanketed nlte model atmospheres are in radiative and in hydrostatic equilibrium . besides the main constituents of the atmospheres of pg  1159 stars , helium , carbon , and oxygen , our model atmospheres also contain neon and nitrogen . for the abundances of these elements we use atmospheric parameters taken from the literature which are summarized in table [ tab : parameters ] . for neon an abundance of 2% mass fraction was assumed for all models , according to werner & rauch ( 1994 ) and werner et al .",
    "although the abundances in the literature were mostly determined in analyses of optical spectra the synthetic spectra can also fit the fuv spectra well , which confirms the literature values for abundances in most cases . in fig.[fig : pg1159 ] we display the fuse spectrum of pg1159@xmath0035 together with our synthetic spectrum . as lines of sulfur and silicon were also identified in several objects we included those elements in the synthetic spectra , too .",
    "both were treated with line formation calculations without back - reaction on the atmospheric structure .",
    "we assumed solar abundances for both elements .",

    "[ fig : sis_lines ] we display part of the fuse spectrum of pg  1424 + 535 with a preliminary fit of the sulfur and silicon lines , both with solar abundances .    in former analyses by dreizler & heber ( 1998 ) it was suggested that the nitrogen abundance is a characteristic difference between pulsating and non - pulsating pg  1159 stars , as nitrogen was detected in all gw  vir pulsators with a rather high abundance of 1% by mass , while in stable pg  1159 stars no nitrogen could be detected , except for pg  1144 + 005 ( which is considered outside the instability strip ) . in order to confirm",
    "previously determined n abundances we tried to fit the n resonance doublet at 1238/1242 . for this purpose",
    "we also analysed the stis spectrum of pg  1159@xmath0035 , which has a high resolution ( 0.1 ) and high s / n . in this spectrum",
    "the interstellar component of the resonance doublet is clearly separated from the photospheric component .",
    "this allows to determine the n abundance much more precisely than before and it seems to turn out that the n abundance is also significantly lower , about 0.1% by mass , than suggested by dreizler & heber ( 1998 ) .",
    "[ fig : n_comparison ] shows the n resonance doublets of three objects , the pulsators pg  1159@xmath0035 and pg  1707 + 427 and the non - pulsator pg  1424 + 535 .",
    "while the comparison of pg  1707 + 427 and pg  1424 + 535 seems to confirm the characteristic difference in the n abundance , the new fit to the photospheric components in the stis spectrum of pg  1159@xmath0035 shows that the n abundance is only 0.1% by mass , but still higher than in the non - pulsator pg  1424 + 535 .",
