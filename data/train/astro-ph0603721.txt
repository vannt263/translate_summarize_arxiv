    "large libraries of stellar models and isochrones covering wide ranges of age and metallicities are an essential tool to investigate the properties of resolved and unresolved stellar populations .",
    "we have recently published ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter paper i ) an extended database of scaled - solar stellar evolution models and isochrones that is very well suited to accomplish this goal .",
    "it is however well known that the scaled - solar metal mixture is not universal . in particular , observations of metal abundance ratios in the galaxy ( i.e. , ryan , norris & bessel  1991 ; carney  1996 ; gratton , sneden & carretta  2004 ; sneden  2004 ; ) have shown that [ @xmath0/fe ] ( where with @xmath0 we denote collectively the so called @xmath0-elements o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca and ti ) is larger than zero in population  ii field stars , galactic globular clusters ( see , e.g. , carney  1996 ) and in galactic bulge stars ( see , e.g. , mcwilliam & rich 2004 ) that is , the abundance ratio @xmath0/fe is larger than the solar counterpart .",
    "typical values of [ @xmath0/fe ] in the galactic halo are @xmath12 dex . in addition , also stellar populations in elliptical galaxies appear to have formed with a metal mixture characterized by [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath130 ( see , i.e. , worthey , faber & gonzalez  1992 ; tantalo , chiosi & bressan , 1998 ; trager et al",
    ".  2000 )    from a theoretical point of view , the first extended set of isochrones accounting for the enhancement of oxygen was published by bergbusch & vandenberg  ( 1992 ) ( and oxygen - enhanced horizontal branch models by dorman  1992 ) ; the enhancement of all @xmath0-element was exhaustively addressed by salaris , chieffi & straniero  ( 1993 ) in the regime of low mass , metal poor objects , while weiss , peletier & matteucci  ( 1995 ) studied the high metallicity regime .",
    "an important and useful property of @xmath0-enhanced models shown by salaris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is that , for @xmath0-enhanced mixtures that satisfy the constraint [ ( c+n+o+ne)/(mg+si+s+ca+fe)]=0 ( as for example in case of a constant enhancement of all @xmath0 elements ) low mass stellar models computed with an [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath130 metal distribution are equivalent to scaled - solar ones with the same global metal content @xmath7 ( see also chaboyer , sarajedini & demarque  1992 ) .",
    "this property breaks down at values of z larger than about z=0.002 ( see , e.g. , weiss et al .",
    "1995 , vandenberg & irwin  1997 , salaris & weiss  1998 , salasnich et al .",
    "2000 , vandenberg et al .",
    "2000 , kim et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "these theoretical results have been obtained neglecting the effect of an @xmath0-enhancement on the bolometric corrections to be applied to the theoretical isochrones .",
    "very recently , cassisi et al .  ( 2004 ) addressed this issue for the first time , showing that broadband colors involving the @xmath14 part of the spectrum are affected by the enhancement of the @xmath0-element , whereas redder wavelength bands are not affected .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath16 colors appear bluer than the scaled - solar ones at either the same [ m / h ] or the same [ fe / h ] , the difference increases with increasing metal content and/or decreasing effective temperature .",
    "the best way to mimic @xmath0-enhanced color transformations is to use scaled - solar ones with the same [ fe / h ] , but this equivalence breaks down when the iron content increases above [ fe / h]@xmath171.6 .",
    "these differences are mainly due to the enhancement of mg with lower contributions from the enhancement of si and o.    the use of scaled - solar isochrones to mimic their @xmath0-enhanced counterpart is not valid over the full metallicity range where ratios [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath130 have been observed , so that it is important to compute models and isochrones that include appropriate values of [ @xmath0/fe ] . in the last years salaris & weiss  ( 1998 ) ,",
    "vandenberg et al . ( 2000 ) , vandenberg  ( 2000 ) , salasnich et al .  ( 2000 ) , kim et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have published sets of @xmath0-enhanced isochrones that cover to different degrees the age and metallicity parameter range .",
    "none of these sets adopt appropriate @xmath0-enhanced bolometric corrections and color transformations .    in this paper",
    "we enlarge the parameter space covered by the model and isochrone library presented in paper  i , by extending our computations to an @xmath0-enhanced metal distribution , where the [ @xmath0/fe ] value is consistent with observations of the galactic halo population .",
    "this new library covers exactly the same @xmath18 space , and the same mass ranges of our scaled - solar one presented in paper  i , and it has been computed with the same stellar evolution code and homogeneous physical inputs .",
    "it includes models computed both with and without overshooting from the convective cores , two different choices for the efficiency of mass loss and , for the first time , appropriate @xmath0-enhanced color transformations and bolometric corrections for both the low- and high @xmath7 regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :   2 briefly summarizes the adopted physical inputs , while the model library is presented in   3 .",
    "comparisons with widely used isochrone databases , and with selected empirical constraints are discussed in   4 , and   5 , respectively .",
    "a summary and final remarks follow in   6 .",
    "we used the same stellar evolution code as in paper i , and the reader is referred to this paper for more information . here",
    "we just describe the new chemical and physical inputs necessary for the computation of the @xmath0-enhanced library .",
    "the adopted @xmath0-enhanced mixture is the same as in the models by salaris , deglinnocenti & weiss  ( 1997 ) and salaris & weiss  ( 1998 ) and it is reported in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath0-elements have been enhanced with respect to the grevesse & noels  ( 1993 ) solar metal distribution ( that is the heavy element distribution used in paper  i ) by variable factors , following mainly the results by ryan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) about field population  ii stars .",
    "the overall average enhancement is [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath190.4 .",
    "this @xmath0-enhanced distribution has been used in the nuclear network , the radiative ( iglesias & rogers  1996 , alexander & ferguson  1994 ) and conductive opacities ( potekhin et al .",
    "1999 ) and the equation of state .",
    "although our stellar evolution code can account for the atomic diffusion of helium and heavy elements , we decided to neglect this process in our model grid computation .",
    "as largely discussed in paper  i , we have accounted for atomic diffusion when computing the standard solar models .",
    "this choice allowed us to properly calibrate the mixing length ( see below ) and to estimate the initial solar chemical composition .",
    "although in the sun atomic diffusion is essentially fully efficient , spectroscopic observations of stars in galactic globular clusters or field halo stars ( see section ii of paper  i ) point to a drastically reduced efficiency of this process , due possibly to the counteracting effect of rotationally induced mixing processes .",
    "this evidence raises the possibility that the almost uninhibited efficiency of diffusion found in the sun might not be an occurrence common to all stars .",
    "superadiabatic convection is treated according to the cox & giuli  ( 1968 ) formalism of the mixing length theory ( bhm - vitense  1958 ) and the mixing length value is , as in the case of the scaled - solar models , equal to 1.913 , as obtained from a calibration of the solar model ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "all models include mass loss using the reimers formula ( reimers 1975 ) with the free parameter @xmath20 set to two different values : 0.2 and 0.4 , namely @xmath21 . however , later we decided to recompute the model library using also the value @xmath22 .",
    "as for all other models , these additional computations can be found at the url site : http://www.te.astro.it/basti/index.php ] .",
    "we made the same assumptions as in paper  i regarding the treatment of convection at the border of convective core during the core h - burning phase of stars with total mass larger than @xmath23 .",
    "two different values are adopted for the overshoot from the schwarzschild convective boundary , namely @xmath24 and 0.2 .",
    "with @xmath25 we denote the length - expressed as a fraction of the local pressure scale height - crossed by the convective cells in the stable region outside the schwarzschild boundary .",
    "the amount of core overshoot is decreased in the same way as in paper  i , when the convective core size decreases to zero as a consequence of the decreasing total stellar mass .",
    "the treatment of convection in the core of central he - burning stars is exactly the same of paper  i. the possible occurrence of overshooting from the bottom of the convective envelopes has been neglected as in paper  i for the reasons discussed in that paper .",
    "finally , the theoretical tracks and isochrones have been transformed to various observational color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) using color-@xmath26 transformations and bolometric corrections ( that we will denote collectively as ct ) obtained from an updated version of atlas9 model atmospheres ( castelli & kurucz  2003 ) . the scaled - solar and [ @xmath0/fe]=0.4 ct have been described in paper  i and in cassisi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in the latter paper",
    "a subset of the @xmath0-enhanced ct has been used to investigate the impact of an @xmath27>0 $ ] metal distribution on broadband colors .",

    "is referred to paper  i and to cassisi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . here",
    "we only add that the strmgren colors used in this paper were computed according the prescriptions given by relyea & kurucz  ( 1978 ) .",
    "the grid of chemical compositions of our library covers 11 pairs of @xmath18 values , as listed in table  2 , ranging from @xmath7=0.0001 to @xmath7=0.04 .",
    "they are the same @xmath18 values of our scaled - solar library , although the correspondence between @xmath7 and [ fe / h ] is different , due to the effect of the @xmath0-enhancement .",
    "we wish to note that in the scaled - solar library presented in paper  i , the @xmath39 metallicity was originally missing ; it has been added later , in order to improve the sampling of the low - metallicity regime .",
    "we have used @xmath40 for the lowest metallicity , together with @xmath41 that allows to match the calibrated initial he abundance in the sun .",
    "we have used the same stellar mass range and sampling as in paper  i , to be consistent with the scaled - solar library , and to optimize the use of both sets of models in a stellar population synthesis code . for each chemical composition , we have computed the evolution of up to 41 different stellar masses , with a minimum mass equal to @xmath42 , and a maximum mass always equal to @xmath6 .",
    "we adopted a mass step of @xmath43 ( or lower ) for masses below @xmath44 , @xmath45 for masses in the range @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for more massive models .",
    "models less massive than @xmath48 have been computed starting from the pre - ms phase , whereas the more massive ones have been computed starting from a chemically homogeneous configuration on the ms .",
    "all models , apart from the less massive ones whose central h - burning evolutionary times are longer than the hubble time , have been evolved until the c ignition or after the first few thermal pulses along the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "we are already working to extend the evolution of low mass and intermediate mass stars up to the end of the thermal pulses along the agb , using the synthetic agb technique ( see , e.g. , marigo , bressan , & chiosi  1996 and reference therein ) .    in case of models undergoing a violent he flash at the red giant branch ( rgb ) tip",
    ", we do not perform a detailed numerical computation of this phase , but we use the evolutionary values of both the he core mass , @xmath49 , and the chemical profile at the rgb tip to compute the corresponding zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) model ( see vandenberg et al .",
    "2000 for a careful check of the validity of this approach ) .",
    "a subsample of the evolutionary tracks ( models without convective overshoot and @xmath20=0.2 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ htracks ] for the entire chemical composition range .    for each chemical composition",
    ", we have also computed an extended set of he burning models  that is , hb models in addition to the one obtained with our chosen mass loss law  with various different values of the total stellar mass after the rgb phase , using the fixed core mass and chemical profiles given by an rgb progenitor having an age ( at the rgb tip ) of @xmath50gyr .",
    "these models allow one to compute the cmd of synthetic hb populations , including an arbitrary spread of the amount of mass lost along the rgb phase ( typical of galactic globular clusters ) .",
    "the rgb progenitor of these additional hb models has a mass typically equal to @xmath51 at the lowest metallicities , increasing up to 1.0@xmath52 for the more metal - rich compositions .",
    "table  [ zahb ] lists the main characteristics of these hb models , namely , the he core mass at the zahb , the envelope he content , the total mass , luminosity and absolute visual magnitude of the object whose zahb location is at @xmath53 - taken as rapresentative of the mean temperature inside the rr lyrae instability strip . for these additional he - burning computations",
    "we have employed a fine mass spacing , and more than 30 hb models have been computed for each chemical composition . a subset of these models is displayed in fig .",
    "[ hetracks ] .",
    "the same figure shows also the location of the zahb and central he - exhaustion loci .",
    "all the post - zahb computations have been extended either to the onset of thermal pulses for more massive models , or until the luminosity along the white dwarf cooling sequence has decreased down to @xmath54 for less massive objects .",
    "they allow a detailed investigation of the various evolutionary paths that follow the exhaustion of the central he burning .",
    "the individual evolutionary tracks have been reduced to the same number of points , to facilitate the computation of isochrones and their use in a population synthesis code . along each evolutionary track",
    "some characteristic homologous points ( key points  kps ) corresponding to well - defined evolutionary phases have been identified .",
    "the choice and number of kps had to fulfill two conditions : 1 ) all main evolutionary phases have to be properly accounted for ; 2 ) the number of kps has to be large enough to allow a suitable sampling of the track morphology , even for fast evolutionary phases .",
    "the second condition requires also that the number of points between two consecutive kps has to be properly chosen .    for a careful description of the adopted kps we refer to paper  i. in the original version of the database",
    ", we adopted 14 key stages along the evolutionary tracks ( see paper  i ) . for our actual stellar models library ,",
    "we have accounted for 16 key stages along the evolutionary track to obtain a more accurate sampling of the track morphology ( we thank a. dolphin for pointing out to us the need of a more accurate sampling of the rgb bump region )",
    ". of course all evolutionary tracks for the scaled - solar metal distribution have been re - reduced by accounting for the same 16 kps .",
    "the whole set of evolutionary computations ( but the additional hb models discussed above ) have been used to compute isochrones for a large age range , namely , from 30  myr up to 16  gyr ( older isochrones can also be computed ) , from the zero age main sequence ( zams ) up to the first thermal pulse along the agb or to the c ignition.100  myr , stars of @xmath55 would be still evolving along the pre - ms phase , whereas in our isochrones they appear along the zams .",

    "detailed tables displaying the relevant evolutionary features for all computed tracks are also available .    the files containing the isochrones provide at each point ( 2000 points in total ) the initial value of the evolving mass , the actual mass value ( in principle different , due to the effect of mass loss ) , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and absolute magnitudes in different photometric systems ( see the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "these isochrones - as well as those for a scaled - solar metal distribution - can be used as input data for our fortran code @xmath60 that we have written in order to compute synthetic cmds , integrated colors and integrated magnitudes of a generic stellar population with an arbitrarily chosen star formation rate and age metallicity relation .",

    ", we wish to briefly discuss the effect of an @xmath0-enhanced metal distribution on the hb evolution .",
    "although the effect of @xmath1enhanced mixtures on h - burning models is well known and widely discussed in the literature ( see the references in the introduction ) the behavior of @xmath0-enhanced he - burning models compared to their scaled - solar counterpart has been investigated only by salaris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , although the latter studied the effect on the zahb location only . an earlier investigation by bencivenni et al .  ( 1989 ) did not take into account the effect of an [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath130 mixture on the hb progenitor evolution .",
    "figure  [ hba ] shows the comparison between an @xmath1enhanced hb model in the instability strip and the corresponding scaled - solar one at fixed total mass for various values of @xmath7 . at fixed total mass and global metallicity ,",
    "@xmath1enhanced hb models appear brighter and hotter than the scaled - solar ones , and in particular for values of @xmath7 larger than @xmath190.002 . at @xmath61 ,",
    "the luminosity difference is negligible , @xmath62 , while at @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "these differences increase to @xmath65 and @xmath66 at @xmath67 and @xmath7=0.04 , respectively . these results about the brighter and hotter location of @xmath0-enhanced hb models in the instability strip agree well with the findings by salaris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and vandenberg et al .",
    "for @xmath680.002 the @xmath1enhanced zahb models have a he core mass lower than the scaled - solar case by only @xmath69 ( regardless of the metallicity ) and an envelope he abundance essentially equal to or lower by at most @xmath700.001 ; this means that the difference in the zahb location and hb evolution is due to the increased efficiency of the cno - cycle in the h - burning shell with respect to the core burning in models with an [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath130 distribution .    as for the lifetime along the hb phase for a given @xmath7",
    ", we find that it is only marginally affected by the use of an @xmath1enhanced metal distribution , irrespective of the precise value of @xmath7 .",
    "the central he - burning lifetime decreases compared to the scaled - solar mixture by a negligible @xmath71% at low metallicity , and about @xmath72% at the highest metallicity of our model grid .",
    "the same change holds for the agb lifetime up to the thermal pulse phase .",
    "this has the important consequence that the theoretical calibrations of the @xmath73 parameter ( number ratio of agb stars to hb stars ; see e.g. caputo et al .",
    "1989 ) is not affected by the adopted metal distribution .",
    "this parameter is very important for its sensitivity to the extension of the convective cores during the central he - burning phase , and is used to assess the efficiency of the breathing pulses at the exhaustion of the central he .",
    "a further important evolutionary feature is the brightness of the agb clump , marking the ignition of the he - burning in a shell .",
    "we have verified that the brightness of the agb clump is slightly larger with respect the scaled - solar case , the difference tracking the luminosity difference of the zahb models .",
    "this implies that the brightness difference between the zahb and the agb clump is preserved when passing from a scaled - solar mixture to an @xmath1enhanced one with the same @xmath7 , for any value of @xmath7 .",
    "cassisi et al .  (",
    "2004 ) analized the impact of @xmath0-enhanced ct in the @xmath74 filters , for the metallicity regime of galactic globular clusters , and their results have been already summarized in the introduction . here",
    "we extend the analysis to higher metallicities .",
    "figure  [ ubvihz ] shows the comparison between 12  gyr old @xmath0-enhanced isochrones and zahb for @xmath7=0.0198 and @xmath7=0.04 in various cmds , using different ct .",
    "more in detail , we used the appropriate @xmath0-enhanced ct , a scaled - solar ct with the same [ fe / h ] of the isochrone , and a scaled - solar ct with the same [ m / h ] ( total metallicity ) of the isochrone .    we find ( in agreement with the results at lower @xmath7 ) that the @xmath57 magnitudes are hardly affected , whereas the @xmath16 and @xmath15 colors predicted by the scaled - solar ct with the same [ m / h ] of the isochrone are systematically redder along the whole isochrone .",
    "differences are smaller when considering scaled - solar ct with the same [ fe / h ] of the isochrone .",
    "this occurrence means that it is the abundance of fe and of all other scaled - solar elements that contribute mostly to the observed color , although not completely , given the difference with the appropriate ct ",
    "but they still reach up to @xmath19 0.1  mag along a large fraction of the isochrone .",
    "this is due to the effect of the @xmath0-enhancement in the wavelength range of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 filter ( see discussion in cassisi et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "a different approach to mimic @xmath0-enhanced ct with scaled solar ones , is to use scaled - solar ct with the same [ @xmath0/h ] ratio of the [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath130 distribution .",
    "so doing , one assumes that it is essentially the abundance of @xmath0-elements that affects the colors .",
    "the data in figure  [ ubvihz ] show that this choice is much less accurate , since it corresponds to a scaled - solar ct with a [ m / h ] value 0.4  dex larger that the actual one , that yields even redder colors .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath77 color is also affected by the ct choice at high metallicities and low temperatures .",
    "the two scaled - solar ct produce colors this time systematically bluer than the appropriate @xmath0-enhanced ct , the ct with the same [ fe / h ] of the isochrone giving the worst results . on the basis of our previous discussion",
    "it is clear that in this case a scaled - solar ct with the same [ @xmath0/h ] ratio of the isochrone would provide colors closer to the appropriate ones .",
    "this suggests that the abundance of the @xmath0-elements ( or at least some of them ) starts to dominate the ct in this wavelength range for solar and super - solar metallicities , and low temperatures",
    ".    figure  [ strom1 ] shows another comparison of ct applied to a 12  gyr old @xmath0-enhanced isochrone at various @xmath7 , considering the appropriate @xmath0-enhanced transformations and the same two choices for the scaled - solar ct as in fig .",
    "[ ubvihz ] , this time involving the strmgren filters .",
    "the strmgren @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 filters are located in the wavelength range of the johnson @xmath75 and @xmath76 bands ; therefore one expects a relevant influence of the @xmath0-elements on , for example , the @xmath81 $ ] color - color plane , used to estimate ages of star clusters and field stars , independently of the knowledge of their distance .",
    "the use of different ct affects strongly the isochrone morphology in this plane , as shown clearly by fig .",
    "[ strom1 ] .",
    "the effect is appreciable from @xmath820.001 and is , as expected , larger at larger metallicities .",
    "the sections of the isochrone that are more affected are , as for the case of johnson colors , the rgb and the lower ms .",
    "again , scaled - solar ct at the same [ fe / h ] of the appropriate ones give a better approximation to the real ct , apart from the highest @xmath7 , where differences are huge for both scaled solar ct . in fig .",
    "[ strom2 ] we show isochrones for various ages and @xmath83 , transformed to the @xmath81 $ ] plane using the same three choices of ct .",
    "one can notice that the 12  gyr old isochrone transformed using the scaled - solar ct with the appropriate [ fe / h ] matches well turn off ( to ) and subgiant branch obtained with the appropriate colors . on the contrary , using scaled - solar ct with the same [ m / h ] of the @xmath0-enhanced ones causes not only a change of the morphology of the lower ms and the rgb , but also a shift of both @xmath84 and @xmath85 of the upper ms , to and subgiant region ; this induces systematic errors in both the age and reddening determined from isochrone fitting .",

    "<S> the initial he mass fraction is @xmath9=0.245 for the most metal - poor models and increases with @xmath7 according to @xmath10=1.4 , to reproduce the initial solar he obtained from the calibration of the solar model . </S>",
    "<S> models with and without the inclusion of overshoot from the convective cores during the central h burning phase are provided , as well as models with different mass loss efficiencies .    </S>",
    "<S> we also provide complete sets of evolutionary models for low - mass , he - burning stellar structures covering the whole metallicity range , to enable synthetic horizontal branch simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare our database with several widely used stellar model libraries from different authors , as well as with various observed color magnitude and color - color diagrams ( johnson - cousins @xmath11 and near infrared magnitudes , strmgren colors ) of galactic field stars and globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we also test our isochrones comparing integrated optical colors and surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes with selected globular cluster data . </S>",
    "<S> we find a general satisfactory agreement with the empirical constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> this database , used in combination with our scaled - solar model library , is a valuable tool for investigating both galactic and extra - galactic simple and composite stellar populations , using stellar population synthesis techniques . </S>"
