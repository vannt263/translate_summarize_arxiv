    "intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , with masses @xmath2 possibly exist at the centres of globular clusters ( gcs ) or small galaxies , if we assume that they follow the observed correlations between super - massive bhs ( smbhs ) and their stellar surroundings ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", these objects can not form via the formation scenarios of stellar - mass black holes , which are the final results of stellar evolution of massive stars @xcite or smbhs with masses @xmath3 , that exist at the centres of galaxies @xcite and for which there exists an emerging consensus about their formation @xcite .",
    "there have been proposed several scenarios for the formation of imbhs most of which require extremely dense environments , similar to the centers of gcs , for the imbhs to form and grow in mass @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest in their work that such massive black holes ( bhs ) can form from repeated mergers of a @xmath4 bh , located at the center of a gc , with other sbh of lower mass . the @xmath4 threshold is required to ensure that the bh will not receive large recoil velocities after each merger and",
    "so will remain bound to the gc . according to @xcite the initial @xmath4 bh",
    "could be formed either directly from the collapse of a massive star , or from a large number of sbh - sbh mergers , which would produce mostly escaping sbhs , but also a minority of large bhs , bound to the gc .",
    "an interesting scenario for the formation of imbhs in the early evolution of gcs , has been studied by @xcite . according to this scenario ,",
    "the most massive stars sink to the centre of a gc even before they become bhs and thus the cluster experiences an early core collapse during which the central density of stars becomes large enough , that massive stars start to rapidly and continuously merge with each other ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this runaway process very soon leads to the formation of a very massive star ( vms ) , located close to the centre of the gc .",
    "it is unknown how stellar evolution proceeds in such a vms @xcite , but if it is assumed that the star directly collapses to a bh , without significant mass - loss , this could form an imbh .",
    "accretion of stars and gas during the next myrs could increase its mass up to two orders of magnitude @xcite . finally , as in smbhs ,",
    "population iii stars have been proposed as possible progenitors of imbhs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but there are still many uncertainties in the evolution of such a star @xcite .",
    "although the formation of imbhs has been studied extensively during the last decades and their existence has been proposed in the early 70s @xcite , there is still no direct proof of their existence .",
    "however , there is an increasing number of favouring evidences that suggest that they should exist .",
    "the most prominent evidence is from the observations of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are usually associated to imbhs .",
    "the brightest known ulx , known as hlx-1 , is located in the outskirts of the edge - on s0a type galaxy eso243 - 49 and is currently the strongest imbh candidate .",
    "based on the extreme luminosity of the x - ray source , which has a maximum of up to @xmath5 in the @xmath6 kev band , @xcite derive a conservative lower limit of @xmath7 for the potential imbh ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recent observations measured a peak luminosity of @xmath8 @xcite and a possible period of variability of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "x - ray luminosities up to @xmath10 can be explained by super - eddington accretion to @xmath11 sbhs @xcite and/or beaming @xcite .",
    "however , larger bh masses are needed for explaining luminosities @xmath12 .",
    "for hlx-1 the most recent estimate for the mass of the potential imbh is @xmath13 @xcite , very well in the range of masses of imbhs .",
    "further investigations of hlx-1 confirmed its extraordinary luminosity by proving its association with galaxy eso243 - 49 at a distance of 95 mpc @xcite , and thus made the evidence of an imbh even stronger .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray source is not located at the center of the host galaxy , but it lies at a distance @xmath14 from its center and @xmath15 out of the galactic plane , possibly associated with a star cluster which appears to be in the same area . according to @xcite this cluster has a mass of @xmath16 and",
    "is either a massive young star cluster or an old gc .",
    "optical observations of hlx-1 with vlt seem to rule out the case of a massive star cluster and favour the presence of a @xmath17 old globular cluster with mass @xmath18 or a @xmath19 small star cluster with mass @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "other recent interesting observational examples that point to the existence of these objects can be found in the work of @xcite , which evaluates a sample of eight extreme luminosity ultra - luminous x - ray source candidates and state that the observed luminosities can be explained in terms of imbhs with masses in the range of @xmath21 .",
    "another x - ray source that might be associated with an imbh is found at the center of the nearby ( @xmath22 , @xcite ) dwarf lenticular galaxy ngc 404 @xcite . using both stellar and gas dynamical mass estimates , @xcite estimated the mass of the potential imbh to be @xmath23 , which agrees with recent estimates from expanded very large array observations @xcite and from x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite confirmed the location of the source at the center of the nuclear star cluster hosted by ngc 404 and ruled out other possible scenarios such as an x - ray binary , stellar formation or a supernova remnant .",
    "the above observational examples provide strong evidence of the existence of imbhs , but do not indisputably prove that they exist .",
    "a direct proof would come from detailed kinematical observations of stars moving under the influence of the imbh at the centers of gcs .",
    "unfortunately , the radius of influence of an imbh is only of a few arc seconds @xcite , so it is very difficult , if not impossible , to accurately determine its mass by measuring the velocities of stars moving under its influence , with the currently available instruments .",
    "this technique has been successfully used for determining the mass of the smbh at the centre of the milky way galaxy , where the stellar environment is less dense than the core of gcs and also there exists a number of young and bright stars , moving under the gravitational influence of the smbh which have been followed by observations for more than 15 years @xcite .",
    "the radius of influence @xmath24 of an imbh of mass @xmath25 can be defined as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 the velocity dispersion at the center of the cluster . at a distance @xmath28",
    "this translates to an angular radius of influence @xcite : @xmath29 for a @xmath30 imbh the influence radius is of @xmath31 , assuming a central velocity dispersion of @xmath32 and a distance of @xmath33 kpc ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar example ) .",
    "also , since gcs are old systems , this small sphere of influence contains mainly massive stellar remnants and old , dim stars that could not be easily observed and traced . for the above reasons ,",
    "kinematical techniques can currently only give upper limits on the mass of the potential imbhs at the centers of galactic gcs @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for observations that do not support the imbh scenario ) .",
    "since such limits are based on measurements of proper motions , velocity dispersion or line of sight motions away of the sphere of influence of the potential imbh , alternative to imbh explanations can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "hence , we would need the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) and one of the next - generation near - infrared instruments , the vsi or gravity @xcite . in that case",
    "we could improve the astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude and thus we would possibly be in the position of detecting the innermost kinematics of a gc around a potential imbh and thus measure accurately its mass .    an interesting avenue towards the _ direct _ detection of an imbh , which would not require future optical or infrared telescopes and several years of observations , is gw astronomy .",
    "additionally , imbh - sbh binaries that might form in gcs represent an excellent test of gr , since they are similar to extreme mass - ratio inspirals @xcite . in particular , space - borne detectors such as the esa - led elisa @xcite or chinese mission study options (  alia  from now onwards , see * ? ? ?",

    "if an imri forms in a gc , it is undoubted that sooner or later it will lead to an imbh - sbh merger .",
    "recent studies from numerical relativity @xcite show that bh - bh mergers result to a gravitational wave recoil which , depending on the mass - ratio and spins of the merging bhs , might be as large as @xmath35 @xcite",
    ". the mass - ratio of an imri in a gc is large enough to avoid such large recoils , but it is still possible for an imbh of mass up to @xmath36 to receive a kick greater than the escape velocity of the gc and therefore leave the system @xcite .    in this work we use @xmath1-body simulations to study the interactions of an imbh with sbhs in young star clusters and describe , for the first time , the production on an imri with our direct - summation code in one of our integrations . in section [ sec : tool ] we describe the numerical tool and choice of the initial data used for the simulations . in section [ sec : dynamics ]",
    "we describe the interactions of the imbh with sbhs in the simulation we observed an imri , and we discuss the possibility that the gravitational recoil velocity assigned to the imbh after the merger , kicks the imbh out of the gc . in section",
    "[ sec : gw ] we calculate the gravitational radiation from such an imri in an approximate way .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude our work showing that an imri would be detectable by future space - based gw detectors , such as lisa , we discuss the effects of the ejection of the imbh on the gc , their possible connection with ulxs not associated with gcs and we present our future plans for a statistical study of imbh - sbh interactions in gcs .",
    "we integrate the dynamical evolution of a globular cluster containing a @xmath37 imbh with ` myriad ` @xcite , a direct - summation @xmath38body code that integrates all gravitational forces for all particles at every time step .",
    "the programme uses the hermite integration scheme @xcite .",
    "this requires computation of not only the accelerations , but also their time derivatives .",
    "particles that are tightly bound or with very small separation are integrated using the time - symmetric hermite scheme @xcite , which is a symplectic integrator that makes the numerical errors oscillate between two limits that can be controlled by the choice of the time step .",
    "the code uses post - newtonian correcting terms to the newtonian forces , including 1 , 2 and 2.5 order , as described for the first time in an @xmath38body code by @xcite ( their equations 1 , 2 and 3 ) , as well as a recipe for gravitational recoil .",
    "the recoil velocity depends strongly on the mass ratio of the two holes , on the magnitude of their spins and on their directions with respect to the plane of the orbit ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the equation that we have implemented in the code is taken from @xcite ,    @xmath39    in the last equation , the indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for perpendicular and parallel directions with respect to the orbital angular momentum vector @xmath42 of the binary .",
    "@xmath43 is a unit vector and lies on the plane of the orbit connecting the two mbhs , with direction from the heavier to the lighter one .",
    "@xmath44 is also on the plane of the orbit , but perpendicular to @xmath43 , with direction such that @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 construct an orthonormal system , with @xmath45 defined such that it is the unit vector parallel to @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath46 is the angle between the unequal contributions of mass and spin to the recoil velocity .",
    "we assign random , maximal spins to the stars of the gc , and in particular we initially give the imbh a spin @xmath47 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of 0.998 .",
    "we assume that the imbh forms at the center of the cluster when the gc is @xmath48 old .",
    "this agrees with the formation scenario of runaway stellar mergers @xcite and also of the repeated sbh - sbh mergers @xcite . for our study",
    "the number and masses of sbhs are of particular importance .",
    "therefore , before creating the initial data for our simulations , we studied the number of sbhs and their masses assuming different initial mass functions ( imf ) and metallicities . for the initial mass function ( imf )",

    "further ( i.e. after the @xmath48 of the initial data ) stellar evolution would create a number of sbhs with very low mass ( @xmath82 ) , which would have a negligible influence on the dynamics of the imbh and on a possible binary that the imbh would form with one of the higher - mass sbhs .",
    "low - mass sbhs are expected not to be able to replace higher - mass sbh as companions of the imbh .",
    "instead , they are expected to be ejected easily through natal kicks and interactions with the imbh and other higher - mass sbhs @xcite .    from our set of simulations , only case a had an imri ; we will therefore focus on this case in the remainder of the article .",
    "as of now , ` myriad ` runs only with the assistance of the special - purpose grape system @xcite , so that we are subjected to the the availability and performance of grape systems .",
    "initially , the imbh interacts strongly with a sub - group of stars and sbhs that contains approximately @xmath83 members .",

    "soon , most of the stellar - mass bhs of the system sink towards the centre and start to interact with the imbh and its environment . during this process ,",

    "after @xmath85 myr the first stable imbh - sbh binary forms .",
    "the companion of the imbh is a sbh with mass @xmath86 and the initial semi - major axis of this binary is @xmath87 au . at @xmath88 myr",
    "this binary has a strong interaction with another sbh of the system .",
    "the interaction leads to a change of companion for the imbh , which now builds a binary with a sbh of mass @xmath89 .",
    "the initial semi - major axis of the new binary is @xmath90 au .",
    "this binary survives for nearly @xmath91 myr , but its characteristics vary significantly . at @xmath92 myr the semi - major axis changes to @xmath93 au , while the eccentricity increases to @xmath94 . at this point in the simulation ,",
    "this binary interacts strongly with the second most massive sbh , which leads to a companion exchange .",
    "the new binary has an initial semi - major axis of @xmath95 au and a very high eccentricity , of @xmath96 .",
    "the mass of the new companion sbh is @xmath97 . in fig.([fig.semi_eccentricity ] ) we show the evolution of the semi - major axis and eccentricity for all of these binaries combined into a single curve .",
    "after some @xmath98 yr the binary merges and the resulting imbh receives a random recoil velocity that depends on the mass ratio of the two members of the system and on the random spins that the code assigned to them . this `` gravitational rocket '' or",
    "recoil is such that the resulting velocity exceeds the escape velocity and the merged system leaves the gc .",
    "this is due to the fact that we are using a low number of stars for the clusters ; more realistic clusters will have larger escape velocities , so that the retained fraction of recoiling imbh is larger and not well - represented by our case .",
    "we studied the distribution of recoil velocities for a merger of a binary similar to that of simulation a. we ran a two - body interaction @xmath99 times and calculated the recoil using equation ( [ recoil ] ) with different spin orientations and magnitudes for the two black holes .",
    "we found that the most probable recoil velocity for a binary such as the one of case a peaks around 25 @xmath100 , with a probability of 21% that the merged system achieves velocities greater than @xmath101 , of the order of realistic gc escape velocities .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig.bh_positions_relative_to_center ] ) we show the evolution of the distances of the @xmath102 most massive sbhs from the center .",
    "the sbhs inspiral the center very rapidly , as long as the imbh exists in the cluster .",
    "some of them escape the system , after passing very close to the central binary .",
    "after the imbh merges with its binary companion sbh , the coalesced system leaves the gc and the trajectories of the remaining sbhs are not as steep , because they orbit the center of density of the gc without sinking rapidly into it .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig.lagrange ] ) we show the lagrange radii of the cluster during the simulation .",
    "we stop the simulation at @xmath103 after the ejection of the imbh . from t=0 until the ejection of the imbh , which happened at @xmath104 , the lagrange radii increase constantly .",
    "this agrees with other results of other @xmath1-body @xcite and recent monte carlo @xcite simulations of gcs containing imbhs , and it happens because the central imbh and the imbh - sbh binary that forms almost instantly after the beginning of the simulation , act as a heating source for the cluster .",
    "kinetic energy is transferred from the imbh - sbh binary to the stars and sbhs that pass close from the density center making the binary constantly harder and the stars more energetic and thus expanding the cluster . when the imbh is removed from the cluster ,",
    "the heating source is absent , so the cluster starts contracting slowly as is obviously shown in the lagrange radii .",
    "the shrinkage of the cluster would continue until the central number density of stars becomes high enough that another heating source ( i.e. a new binary ) is formed at the center .",
    "even though we integrated the system for another @xmath103 after the ejection , no such source formed .    in all simulations the imbh had as a companion a sbh , which was replaced several times with another sbh usually of greater mass . in the end , the companion of the imbh was one of the most massive sbhs of the cluster .",
    "most of the lower - mass sbhs after sinking to the center and interacting with the central imbh - sbh binary , were kicked out of the gc . also , in none of the simulations we find a main - sequence or giant star tidally disrupted by the imbh .",
    "this is in agreement with the models of @xcite which contain a number of massive sbhs . in our models ,",
    "apart from the imbh , sbhs are the most massive objects in the gc and therefore sink to the center faster than any other star . as a result a imbh - sbh binary forms very soon with the companion of the imbh being more massive than any other non - sbh object of the cluster .",
    "thus , only interactions of the binary with another sbh of comparable or higher mass than the current companion of the imbh may lead to a companion exchange , so it is almost impossible for a normal star to come too close to the imbh to get tidally disrupted .",
    "therefore , tidal disruptions of stars are not favoured in our models .",
    "after the merger , the imbh leaves the gc without any companion .",
    "this may be an artifact of the low number of stars used in the simulation . in real clusters",
    "a small number of stars or remnants are expected to be bound to the imbh , so if the imbh receives a large kick , they will follow it outside the gc .",
    "in this case , and if there are no massive sbhs among the imbh companions , some stars might be tidally disrupted by the imbh , and thus the system might become a ulx not associated with a gc .",
    "in this section we follow the binary imbh - sbh from the standpoint of emission of gws . in fig.([fig.evolution_binary_peters ] ) we can see the evolution of the imri in a semi - major axis and orbital period  eccentricity plane .",
    "the binary enters the plot from the top with a high eccentricity , which places it very close to the innermost stable circular orbit , but the loss of energy quickly circularises it and drives it to lower eccentricities . as we discussed in the previous section , the binary forms with a very small initial semi - major axis , so that it hardens very efficiently .",
    "hence , the binary follows closely what we can expect from the approach of @xcite , since the post - newtonian terms lead the evolution of the system , which can be regarded as dynamically decoupled from the gc .",
    "it then enters the band of a lisa - like or alia detector with a significant eccentricity and the simulation is stopped when the semi - major axis is @xmath105 , the schwarzschild radius of the imbh .",
    "that is the moment at which the code assigns a recoil velocity to the merged system based on the spins of the two compact objects .    in fig.([fig.evolution_binary_peters_alia_lisa ] ) we can see the same from the perspective of the characteristic amplitude and frequency of the waves .",
    "we display the first harmonics in the approximation of keplerian ellipses of @xcite .",
    "in this work we have investigated with a direct - summation code the evolution of gcs that harbour an imbh in their center .",
    "the code uses relativistic corrections and a prescription for gravitational recoil . for one of the cases we find that an imri forms with a sbh due to close interactions , which leads to the ejection of imbh after coalescence .",
    "we follow the properties of the imri from a standpoint of the global evolution of the cluster and of gw .    before the formation of the imri and",
    "the subsequent ejection of the imbh , the cluster experiences strong expansion as a result of two - body relaxation in the presence of an imbh .",
    "the imbh - sbh binaries that are formed transfer kinetic energy to the stars that sink to the center and as a result the gc expands significantly .",
    "some of the inner lagrange radii of the cluster almost double in size during the first @xmath106 of dynamical evolution . also ,",
    "most of the massive sbhs sink to the center very rapidly and after interacting with the imbh , if they do not become its companions , they receive large kicks and get ejected violently from the gc . after the ejection of the imbh , the gc slowly starts to contract as a result of the absence of the heating source at the center .",
    "this might lead to another core collapse of the gc , something we do not observe in the simulation in the first @xmath48 after the ejection if the imbh .    in our simulations ,",
    "the imbh forms a binary with a sbh very early and then exchanges its companion several times . in the simulation we observed an imri , the imbh formed a binary with the second most massive sbh of the system .",
    "the initial high eccentricity of the imbh - sbh binary lead to an imri and a subsequent merger .",
    "we showed that for @xmath107 the energy loss of the binary in gws is easily detectable by space - borne missions such as a lisa - like observatory @xcite or alia in its 8 pc configuration .",
    "moreover , the imri enters the bandwidth of the detectors with a very high eccentricity , @xmath108 , as with the emris .",
    "one year before the final coalescence , the system still retains a residual eccentricity of @xmath109 , and ten minutes before merger of @xmath110 , which is detectable by data - analysis techniques @xcite .",
    "imris represent a test of gr , as well as a probe of space and time around massive black holes and also of the innermost kinematics of gcs to very large distances , of the order of a few gpc . on the top of that",
    ", a successful detection would represent very robust proof for the existence of imbhs .",
    "the fact that the kick is making the merged system leave the gc is possibly an artifact of the low particle number we used in the simulations , though in principle recoiling velocities can be much higher than the escape velocity of a cluster , of the order of @xmath111 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we have also demonstrated that there is a non - negligible statistical probability that a similar case leads to a kick of the imbh off a realistic gc .    in our simulations",
    "we do not observe any tidal disruption of stars and also in the simulation in which we had an imri , the imbh left the system without any companion .",
    "this is probably also an artifact of the low number of stars used in the simulations . in real clusters",
    "normally there is a small number of stars bound to the imbh , so after all the sbhs are ejected and probably after some imbh - sbh mergers , the imbh will be followed by a number of main - sequence or giant stars , even if it is ejected from the gc .",
    "therefore , if after the imbh - sbh merger the imbh remains in the gc , it might soon become an x - ray source at the center of the cluster , similar to the ulxs that are located at the centers of gcs ( e.g. the ulx at ngc 404 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , if it escapes the gc , followed by the stars bound to it , it might soon become a ulx outside of the gc . in this context",
    ", hlx-1 might be an escaping imbh that originated at the center of eso243 - 49 and received a large recoil velocity after a merger with a massive sbh .",
    "the kick is responsible for the escape if the imbh , which is followed by a number of stars gravitationally bound to it .",
    "this scenario supports one of the possible scenarios for hlx-1 suggested by @xcite according to which the hlx-1 is an imbh embedded in a young population of stars with ages @xmath112 and total mass with upper bound of @xmath113 .",
    "a larger number of simulations of escaping imbhs using a realistic number of stars would be appropriate for testing this scenario .    in spite of the code",
    "been ported to run on a pc with special - purpose hardware grape , we can not cover a broader parameter space , nor study cases with a larger number of stars , or study the global dynamical evolution of the gc after the kick for a longer time .",
    "we plan on performing a better parameter space exploration thanks to the availability of gpus , which will allow us to address the limitations we described above .",
    "this will allow us to investigate the potential global structure of the gc after the kick , since the impact on the cluster could in principle be a signature for the process .",
    "also , it will allow us to study also the properties and detectability of the escaping imbhs and their possible companions .",
    "we thank emma robinson for comments on the manuscript and nikolaos stergioulas for suggesting us to examine also the possibility of kicks .",
    "sk and pas are indebted to xuefei gong , shan bai and yun kau lau for conversations , their hospitality in beijing and for sharing with us the data for the sensitivity curve of the alia detector .",
    "pas thanks the organizers of the 2011 summer workshop at the aspen center for physics for inviting him to attend .",
    "sk and pas are thankful to rainer spurzem and fukun liu for the invitation to the meeting in lijiang on black holes and to visit the kiaa and naoc in beijing in summer of 2011 , where this work was finished .",
