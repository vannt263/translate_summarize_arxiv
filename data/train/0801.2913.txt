    "orbits of coadjoint representations of semisimple lie groups are an extremely interesting subject .",
    "these homogeneous spaces are flag manifolds .",
    "remarkable , that the coadjoint orbits of compact groups are khlerian manifolds . in 1950s",
    "a.  borel , r.  bott , j.  l.  koszul , f.  hirzebruch et al . investigated the coadjoint orbits as complex homogeneous manifolds .",
    "it was proven that each coadjoint orbit of a compact connected lie group @xmath0 admits a canonical @xmath0-invariant complex structure and the only ( within homotopies ) @xmath0-invariant khlerian metrics .",
    "furthermore , the coadjoint orbits can be considered as fibre bundles whose bases and fibres are coadjoint orbits themselves .",
    "coadjoint orbits appear in many spheres of theoretical physics , for instance in representation theory , geometrical quantization , theory of magnetism , quantum optics .",
    "they serve as definitional domains in problems connected with nonlinear integrable equations ( so called equations of soliton type ) . since these equations have a wide application , the remarkable properties of coadjoint orbits interest not only mathematicians but also physicists .",
    "it should be pointed out that much of our material is , of course , not new , but drawn from various areas of the mathematical literature .",
    "the material was collected for solving the physical problem based on a classical heisenberg equation with @xmath1 as a gauge group .",
    "the equation describes a behavior of magnetics with spin @xmath2 .",
    "the paper includes an investigation of geometrical and topological properties of the coadjoint orbits .",
    "we hope it fulfills a certain need .",
    "we would like to mention that we have added a number of new results ( such as an explicit expression for a stereographic projection in the case of group @xmath3 and improving the way of its computation , the idea of obtaining the khlerian potential on an orbit , an introduction of basis two - forms for the cohomology ring of an orbit ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : coadjoint_orbits ] we recall the notion of a coadjoint orbit , propose a classification of the orbits , and describe the orbit as a fibre bundle over an orbit with an orbit as a fibre .",
    "section  [ s : complex_param ] is devoted to a generalized stereographic projection from a lie algebra onto its coadjoint orbit , it gives a suitable complex parameterization of the orbit .",
    "as an example , we compute an explicit expression for the stereographic projection in the case of group @xmath3 . in section  [ s : kahler_structure ]",
    "we propose a way of obtaining khlerian structures and khlerian potentials on the orbits .",
    "section  [ s : topology ] concerns a structure of the cohomology rings of the orbits and finding of g - invariant bases for the cohomology groups .",
    "we start with recalling the notion of a coadjoint orbit .",

    "let @xmath6 be the maximal torus of @xmath0 , and @xmath7 be the maximal commutative subalgebra ( also called a cartan subalgebra ) of @xmath4 .",

    "the subset @xmath9 of @xmath5 is called a of @xmath0 through  @xmath10 .    in the case of classical lie groups",
    "we can use the standard representations for adjoint and coadjoint operators : @xmath11 comparing these formulas one can easily see that _ a coadjoint orbit coincides with an adjoint one_.    define the _ stability subgroup _ at a point @xmath12 as @xmath13 . the coadjoint operator induces a bijective correspondence between an orbit @xmath14 and a coset space @xmath15 ( in the sequel , we deal with right coset spaces ) .",
    "first of all , we classify the coadjoint orbits of an arbitrary semisimple group @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , each orbit is drawn from a unique point , which we call an _ initial point _ and denote by @xmath16 .",
    "the following theorem from  @xcite allows to restrict the region of search of an initial point .",

    "the action of @xmath27 is performed by the coadjoint operator .",

    "the positive weyl chamber is filled with grey color .",

    "note , that a stability subgroup @xmath51 as @xmath52 generically coincides with the maximal torus @xmath6 .",
    "however , if @xmath53 belongs to a degenerate orbit , then @xmath51 is a lager subgroup of @xmath0 containing @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we define a generic orbit by @xmath54 and a degenerate one by @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "an important topological property of the coadjoint orbits is the following .",
    "_ almost each orbit can be regarded as a fibre bundle over an orbit with an orbit as a fibre , except for the maximal degenerate orbits .",
    "_ indeed , if there exists an initial point @xmath16 such that @xmath58 , one can form a coset space @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the orbit @xmath60 is a fibre bundle over the base @xmath61 with the fibre @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes a projection from the orbit onto the base .",
    "moreover , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are coadjoint orbits themselves .",
    "we claim this by    suppose @xmath67 is not the maximal degenerate orbit of @xmath0 . then a subgroup @xmath68 such that @xmath69 exists , and @xmath48 is a fibre bundle over the base @xmath70 with the fibre @xmath71 : @xmath72    we illustrate the proposition by examples .",
    "the group @xmath73 has the only type of orbits : @xmath74 the group @xmath3 has generic and degenerate orbits : @xmath75 comparing the above coset spaces we see that a generic orbit @xmath76 is a fibre bundle over a degenerate orbit @xmath77 with a fibre @xmath78 : @xmath79    the group @xmath80 has several types of degenerate orbits .",
    "there is a list of all possible types of orbits : @xmath81 as a result , there exist several representations of a generic orbit @xmath82 as a fibre bundle .",
    "for example , @xmath83    in the paper we consider compact classical lie groups .",

    "we list the maximal tori of all these groups , and their representations as fibre bundles .",
    "the maximal torus of @xmath1 is @xmath86 ; the generic type of orbits can be represented as @xmath87    the maximal torus of @xmath84 as @xmath88 and @xmath89 has the following form @xmath90 ; the generic type of orbits can be represented as @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 denote real grassman manifolds .",
    "the maximal torus of @xmath85 is @xmath86 ; the generic type of orbits can be represented as @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the quaternionic ring .",
    "in the theory of lie groups and lie algebras different ways of parameterization of coadjoint orbits are available . as the most prevalent we choose a @xcite .",
    "it is named so since in the case of group @xmath73 it gives the well - known stereographic projection onto the complex plane , which is the only orbit of @xmath73 .",
    "the generalized stereographic projection is a projection from a dual space onto a coadjoint orbit parameterized by complex coordinates .",
    "complex coordinates are introduced by the well - known procedure that combines iwasawa and gauss - bruhat decompositions .",
    "these coordinates are often called  @xcite .",
    "we start with complexifying a group @xmath0 in the usual way : @xmath96 .",
    "a generic orbit of @xmath0 is defined in @xmath97 by montgomery s diffeomorphism : @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the minimal parabolic subgroup of @xmath97 .",
    "equation becomes apparent from the iwasawa decomposition @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the real abelian subgroup of @xmath97 , @xmath102 is a nilpotent subgroup of @xmath97 , and @xmath103 is the maximal compact subgroup of @xmath97 .",
    "since we consider only compact groups @xmath0 , @xmath103 coincides with @xmath0 .",
    "then the iwasawa decomposition of @xmath97 has the following form @xmath104    it is easy to express @xmath105 and @xmath102 in terms of root vectors .",

    "we choose @xmath106 and @xmath107 so that @xmath110 then @xmath111    in this notation @xmath112 .",
    "this makes evident .    in the case of a degenerate orbit",
    ", we have the following diffeomorphism : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the stability subgroup and @xmath115 is the parabolic subgroup with respect to  @xmath48",
    ". then @xmath116 , that proves .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 admits a gauss decomposition ( for the generic type of orbits ) : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the maximal torus of @xmath97 , and @xmath119 in the above notation ; @xmath102 and @xmath120 are nilpotent subgroups of @xmath97 normalized by  @xmath118 . in terms of the root vectors introduced above @xmath121    after @xcite we call @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124",
    "the _ canonical coordinates _ connected with the root basis @xmath125 .",
    "these are coordinates in the group @xmath0 .",
    "a comparison of the gauss and iwasawa decompositions implies that the orbit @xmath43 is diffeomorphic to the subgroup manifold @xmath126 : @xmath127 diffeomorphism asserts that one can parameterize the orbit @xmath43 in terms of the complex coordinates @xmath128 , @xmath129 that are canonical coordinates in @xmath126 .",
    "however , a gauss decomposition is local",
    ". therefore , we use a gauss - bruhat decomposition instead : @xmath130 it gives a system of local charts on the orbit : @xmath131    in the case of a degenerate orbit @xmath48 , @xmath6 is to be replaced by @xmath114 , and @xmath99 by @xmath115 .",
    "it is sufficient to take the intersection over @xmath132 in .",
    "furthermore , in this case , @xmath126 has a less number of coordinates .    each orbit @xmath43 of a compact semisimple lie group @xmath0",

    "now we apply the above scheme to compact classical lie groups , namely @xmath84 , @xmath1 , @xmath85 .",
