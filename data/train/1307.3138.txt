    "we investigated the field - dependence of this peak in magnetic fields up to 30 t and found a shift of the maximum of @xmath6  towards higher temperatures upon increasing the field .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the bpp model , describing a progressive slowing down of spin fluctuations .",
    "we fit our doping- and field - dependent data with a model combining the bpp - dependence of @xmath9  with a linear temperature contribution to @xmath6 , which is observed for the optimally- and over - doped samples ( @xmath17 and @xmath8 ) and seems to be doping - independent , in nice agreement with the doping - independent slope of the macroscopic susceptibility .",
    "the combination of these two contributions is able to describe the doping- and field - dependent @xmath6  data of the underdoped samples over the whole temperature range , from 480k down to @xmath12 .",
    "our model suggests the presence of very slow spin dynamics in underdoped , superconducting samples , which fully disappear beyond optimal doping .",
    "the field - dependence of the bpp fitting parameters suggests that spin fluctuations are enhanced upon applying an external magnetic field . while this observation could suggest a competition between superconductivity and magnetic correlations , the doping - dependence of the peak in @xmath6  and of the activation energy @xmath63",
    "would rather indicate that superconductivity may be intimately related to very slow spin fluctuations . in this regard , further investigating the nature of these fluctuations would be of interest , together with their connection or lack thereof with the magnetism of the parent compound .",

    "<S> the evolution of low - energy spin dynamics in the iron - based superconductor lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1  was studied over a broad doping , temperature , and magnetic field range ( @xmath2 = 0  0.15 , @xmath3 480k , @xmath4 30 t ) by means of @xmath5as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) . an enhanced spin - lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature , @xmath6 , in underdoped superconducting samples ( @xmath2 = 0.045 , 0.05 and 0.075 ) suggests the presence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which are strongly reduced in optimally - doped ( @xmath7 ) and completely absent in overdoped ( @xmath8 ) samples . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous analysis , curie - weiss fits are shown to be insufficient to describe the data over the whole temperature range . instead , a bpp - type model is used to describe the occurrence of a peak in @xmath6 clearly above the superconducting transition , reflecting a progressive slowing down of the spin fluctuations down to the superconducting phase transition . </S>"
