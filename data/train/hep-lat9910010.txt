    "we report on the progress made in our study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson semileptonic decays . a description of the analysis and some more preliminary results are in refs .",
    "the ckm matrix element @xmath2 plays an important rle in over - constraining the unitarity triangle but is only determined to @xmath3 .",
    "the advent of @xmath0-factories will reduce the experimental error in exclusive decays considerably , which must be matched by more precise theoretical determinations of the nonperturbative contribution . with the increase in data",
    ", experiments will be able to study the @xmath4 distribution in @xmath0 and @xmath1 semileptonic decays , as shown by the cleo collaboration , which recently presented a new analysis of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "thus , lattice and experimental data could be combined in a range of @xmath4s where both are reliable , making the model - dependent extrapolation to @xmath6 , traditionally done in lattice analyses , redundant .",
    "a summary of our work is as follows .",
    "we have results at three lattice spacings ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) with heavy quarks at the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quark masses and a light quark ( daughter and spectator ) at the strange quark mass .",
    "this allows us to study the lattice spacing dependence of the matrix elements , @xmath11 and experience leads us to believe the @xmath12-dependence does not change after chiral extrapolation , see ref .",
    "we have additional light quarks at @xmath13 and @xmath14 allowing chiral extrapolations on these lattices .",
    "the quark fields are rotated but the perturbative matching coefficients we use are those of light quarks ; the full mass - dependent calculation is underway .",
    "the final results are at @xmath15 , after chiral extrapolation .    the matrix elements are extracted from three - point correlation functions in which the heavy meson is at rest and the light meson has momentum of ( 0,0,0 ) , ( 1,0,0 ) , ( 1,1,0 ) , ( 1,1,1 ) and ( 2,0,0 ) , in units of @xmath16 . in an approach different to other groups  @xcite we study the @xmath12-dependence and perform the chiral extrapolations in terms of the matrix elements and not the form factors",
    ".    for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays the form factors are determined from matrix elements in the usual way , @xmath17^\\mu \\nonumber\\\\ & + & f^0(q^2)\\frac{m_b^2-m_\\pi^2}{q^2}q^\\mu \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thence we determine the partial widths @xmath18",
    "we interpolate the spatial and temporal matrix elements , extracted from fits to the three - point functions , to fixed physical momenta in the range \\{0.1,@xmath20 , 1.0 } gev as shown in figure  [ fig_mxinterp ] .",
    "= 2.9 in = 2.6 in    a significant systematic error is evident in the interpolation of the matrix elements .",
    "the temporal component , @xmath21 , is defined at zero momentum so all physical momenta are obtained by interpolation . in contrast , the spatial matrix element is not ...",
    "the first point is @xmath22 @xmath23 gev .",
    "all momenta below this are obtained by extrapolation ( see fig .  [ fig_mxinterp ] ) .",
    "thus for lighter quarks the temporal component captures the effect of the nearby @xmath24 pole at @xmath25 and rises rapidly , whereas the spatial component misses this effect .",
    "now one has a choice : introduce a model , eg .",
    "pole dominance , to reproduce the behaviour of the matrix elements in the vicinity of the @xmath24 pole or impose a cut in momentum , below which the extrapolation of the spatial matrix element is considered unreliable .",
    "we wish to avoid any model dependence so we make a cut in momenta at @xmath26 gev .    at @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 the matrix elements are extrapolated to the chiral limit .",
    "the data at @xmath29 are discussed here ( the findings are similar at @xmath27 ) .",
    "three functional forms were compared in the chiral extrapolations : linear , quadratic and including a term @xmath30 . for @xmath31 gev the best fit to the data was the quadratic form . at @xmath32",
    "gev all three functions resulted in unreliable fits , with bad @xmath33 , due to large cutoff effects and an increasingly noisier signal .",
    "therefore the range of momenta we consider is @xmath34 gev .",
    "the error due to extrapolation is estimated by considering the spread in results from the three possible fit forms , in this range .",
    "= 2.9 in = 2.6 in    [ rate_adep ]    figure  [ rate_adep ] shows the @xmath12-dependence of our results ( with strange light quarks ) is very mild .",
    "the matrix elements show a similarly mild @xmath12-dependence  @xcite .",
    "the scale to determine the physical momenta is set from the spin - averaged 1p-1s splitting in charmonium .",
    "the quenched approximation introduces a dependence on the quantity used to set the scale and this is often used to estimate quenching effects .",
    "we repeated the procedure with @xmath35 and found only a small effect which is included in our error estimates , with the caveat that it is almost certainly an underestimate of quenching .",
    "the partial width of @xmath19 , for @xmath31 , is shown as the shaded region in figure  [ rate_final ] .",
    "this width and the statistical error is : @xmath36 .",
    "= 2.9 in = 2.6 in    [ rate_final ]",
    "in ref .  @xcite it was suggested that calculating the ratio of partial widths @xmath37 is a nice way to reduce the uncertainty on @xmath38 , from its current @xmath39 .",
    "the focus collaboration at fermilab expects to have of @xmath40 fully reconstructed @xmath1 decays so the experimental error will be considerably reduced . by calculating a ratio of rates",
    "it is expected that much of the theoretical uncertainties will cancel . in particular , the renormalisation factors cancel , eliminating the perturbative uncertainty .",
    "the analysis of @xmath1 decays proceeds as described for @xmath0 decays with further details in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we report on the update since last year .",
    "the chiral extrapolations at @xmath29 have been done for the pion and kaon final states so we can now calculate the ratio @xmath37 , as shown in figure  [ d2pi_on_d2k ] .",
    "= 2.9 in = 2.6 in    [ d2pi_on_d2k ]    the ratio of partial widths in the range @xmath41 is 1.61(19 ) , where the error is statistical .",
    "we also calculate the ratio @xmath42 , shown in figure  [ b2pi_on_d2pi ]",
    ". with the expected experimental precision in d decays this ratio has the advantage that many uncertainties are reduced and therefore may prove an interesting avenue for a determination of @xmath2 .",
    "= 2.9 in = 2.6 in    [ b2pi_on_d2pi ]",
    "in conclusion we present a preliminary summary of the systematic errors contributing to the theoretical error in @xmath2 and @xmath38 . the uncertainty due to the perturbative matching",
    "is not yet included .",
    "adding in quadrature gives an error of @xmath43 on @xmath2 and @xmath44 on @xmath38 and we expect to improve upon this in the final result .",
