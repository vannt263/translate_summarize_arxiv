    "the superfluidity of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical lattice has been drawing a considerable attention in last several years @xcite .",
    "as is well known , superflow of the bec in free space suffers from an instability when the center of mass velocity reaches a critical value .",
    "such an instability , known as landau or energetic instability , exist when the superfluid flow is not at a local minimum of energy and the system lowers its energy by emitting phonons @xcite . in an optical lattice , in addition to the energetic instability , the bec may also exhibit dynamical or modulational instabilities which have been a subject of active experimental and theoretical research in recent years @xcite .",
    "when the system is in the dynamically unstable regime , small perturbations grow exponentially in time resulting in an irregular dynamics , loss of coherence or an abrupt stop of the transport of the atom cloud @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study dynamical instabilities of atoms in an optical lattice for the case of weak atom - atom interactions and also taking into account quantum fluctuations of atoms .",
    "we recently reported @xcite that , by appropriately selecting the strength of the interactions , the corresponding classical system may exhibit a pulsating dynamical instability in which the atoms nearly periodically collect to a peak in lattice occupation numbers , and subsequently disperse back to ( very close to ) the initial unstable state .",
    "this is different from the conventional view , valid at strong interatomic interactions , that dynamical instabilities for becs in optical lattices are associated with irregular dynamics .",
    "when we incorporate quantum fluctuations of atoms using stochastic phase - space methods , the quasiperiodic behavior is still observable in individual stochastic realizations that represent typical individual experimental realizations .",
    "as the pulsating solitons in each realization appear at different lattice sites due to quantum effects , the quantum mechanical ensemble averages of the wavefunction revival become progressively weaker when the effective interaction strength is increased . other ensemble averages , such as the pulsation amplitude ,",
    "can still provide information about the quantum soliton .",
    "we consider a stationary superfluid flow of a bec in an optical lattice with a large enough flow momentum that triggers the dynamical instability of the corresponding classical nonlinear system . in a quantum system",
    "the corresponding sharp transition to the dynamically unstable regime is smeared out , typically resulting in a progressively increasing dissipation in the dynamics close to the classical onset of the instability @xcite .",
    "we provide a qualitative explanation of the pulsating phenomenon by studying the dynamics of an integrable double - well system .",
    "although the instability is a result of the interplay between the lattice discreteness and the nonlinearity that makes the lattice non - integrable , the dynamics of the lattice with many sites is approximately as if the system is integrable .",
    "related classical pulsations starting from already compressed atom distribution in a lattice have been discussed in @xcite within the frame - work of the nonpolynomial schrdinger equation .",
    "the pulsating instability manifests in the dynamical regime where the nonlinearity is weak . in the mean - field description ,",
    "the size of the nonlinearity is proportional to the atom - atom interactions and the total number of atoms present in the system .",
    "as the number of atoms gets small the mean - field description may breakdown as the relative fluctuations in the system amplifies , and the quantum treatment is inevitable .",
    "we would like to know how the quantum effects smear out the pulsating mechanism as we reduce the number of atoms in the system . at the simplest level",
    ", we study the quantum dynamics of the pulsating instability using the quantum distribution function , in particular , the wigner function method .",
    "the wigner method simulates the quantum mechanical system in classical stochastic process where the quantum fluctuation is included in the initial state . in the case of bec",
    "it gives the time evolution of the whole matter field including both condensate and non - condensate atoms , and allows the scattering between them , which is absent in the classical gp description .    in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the theoretical model , mainly the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite and its discrete variant , the discrete nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equation ( dnlse ) @xcite .",

    ", we verify the existence of the localized soliton solution in the forbidden gap of the linear spectrum . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the time evolution of the dnlse within classical mean - field theory .",
    "although the system initially develops instability the time evolution shows a regular dynamics whereupon the atoms periodically collect themselves into a pulse and disperse back into the unstable state .    in sec .",
    "iv we review the well understood double well system and argue that the dynamical behavior of the multi - site system is analogous to the two - site system , at least in the limit of weak nonlinearity . in sec .",
    "v we study the dynamics beyond the classical mean field theory using truncated wigner approximation ( twa ) ; a phase - space method that approximately solves the dynamics of a quantum system by means of stochastic initial configuration .",
    "we then compare various physical properties such as the number fluctuations and the overlaps of the state of the system in single realizations with an ensemble averages .",
    "quantum dynamics significantly modifies the classical picture as the number of particles gets small .",
    "we observe the damping in the pulsating phenomenon when we average over many stochastic trajectories .",
    "at absolute zero temperature the dynamics of the bec atoms in an optical lattice can be modeled by the mean field gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a wave function corresponding to the bosonic field operator such that @xmath3 , the atom density .",

    "for the non - interacting initial state the number of non - condensate atoms is zero . in the interacting initial state we consider the interaction parameter @xmath199 that corresponds the number of non - condensate atoms @xmath197 .",
    "the figure shows that the uncertainty and the value of the pulse amplitude saturate for the higher atom numbers for both interacting and non - interacting initial states , but rise sharply when the atom number becomes small .",
    "this implies the fluctuation dominance at the smaller atom numbers in which the effective interaction is large .",
    "the figure also shows that the distinction between these two initial states is apparent only for smaller atom numbers .     for interacting ( full ) and non - interacting ( dash ) initial states .",
    "the average is taken over 400 realizations .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are same as in fig .",
    "the amplitudes remain unaffected for higher atom numbers , and the fluctuations acts as a simple random noise to initiate the instability .",
    "however , the quantum noise manifests itself , both in the amplitude and its uncertainty as the number of atoms gets small . ]",
    "we see that the quantum fluctuations have an effect on the collapse and revival of the pulse .",
    "in the case of a single realization the revival seems to be very robust and repeats practically forever .",
    "however , the ensemble average over many stochastic realizations in the wigner method produces a damping in the pulsation .",
    "this damping may be due to the decoherence as the number of the non - condensate atoms grows and their interactions with the atoms in the condensate mode increases .",
    "the quantum effects are more dominant and the revival of the pulse becomes progressively weaker as the number of the atoms becomes small .",
    "in this paper we have presented new insights into the unstable dynamics of the bec in an optical lattice in the limit of weak atom - atom interactions and by incorporating quantum fluctuations .",
    "the common belief is that the flow of the dynamically unstable bec in an optical lattice would be erratic , or lead to the formation of stable solitons .",
    "here we moved a step further and show that , in the classical mean - field theory , the instability may also trigger a quasi - periodic pulsation in the atom density distribution if the atom - atom interactions is weak .",
    "the requirement that linear stability analysis finds a single unstable mode gives the scale for the ` weak ' nonlinearity and the ensuing pulsating phenomena .",
    "a qualitative argument has been put forward to explain the pulsating behavior of the dynamics by comparing the lattice system with the integrable double - well system . in the case of two wells",
    "the unstable mode leads to a non - trivial dynamics in the population imbalance such that an infinitesimal noise could produce a large - amplitude collective oscillation of the atoms between the wells .",
    "an analogous phenomenon is observed in a lattice in the limit of weak atom - atom interactions .",
    "we , therefore , surmise that the pulsating instability is a remnant of the integrability .",
    "we incorporate the quantum fluctuations using stochastic phase - space methods .",
    "we use the bogoliubov approximation to generate the initial state for the time evolution of the system . a sequence of the stochastic fields obtained in this way",
    "are then used to calculate the expectation values of the observables .",
    "we then compare the single realization results with the ensemble averages .",
    "it is observed that the quasiperiodic behavior in the time dynamics can still be seen in the single realizations .",
    "however , the quantum averages show that the revival of the pulse becomes weaker and weaker as the atom number gets small .    for experimental realizations ,",
    "the flow states @xmath222 near the brillouin zone boundary can be prepared by accelerating the lattice @xcite .",
    "alternatively , by exploiting the symmetry of the dnlse , every solution @xmath223 for the given interaction parameter @xmath92 there is a solution @xmath224 for @xmath225 .",
    "that means the state for @xmath103 in the repulsive case is equivalent to the state for @xmath226 in the attractive case .",
    "this symmetry has already been used to generate solitons in a nonlattice gas @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the same technique can be used to observe the pulsating instability in the lattice .",
    "however , given that the pulsating phenomenon only results in the weak nonlinearity limit , the corresponding time scales for the pulsation can be very long and pose a severe technical challenge .    what would be seen in an experiment",
    "depends on how the experiment is carried out .",
    "if averaging over repeated experiments is called for , the ensemble averages are the proper quantities to compare with . on the other hand , it might be possible to monitor atom numbers in the lattice continuously , e.g. , by off - resonant light scattering .",
    "a single realization is therefore observable as a matter of principles .",
    "however , the twa scheme does not take into account back - action of the measurements , which could be severe .",
