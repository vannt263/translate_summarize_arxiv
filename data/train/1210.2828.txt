    "in the last years a great number of experimental and theoretical research has been dedicated to find out how to create and extract entanglement from macroscopic interacting systems @xcite . between them",
    "are chains of interacting spins @xcite , harmonic oscillators and harmonic lattices @xcite and macroscopic states of light @xcite .",
    "these works intend , to respond to several aspects of the physical reality .    in one hand , in some realistic experimental conditions the measurements apparatuses may not resolve single constituents composing the systems but rather global properties , thermodynamically speaking , they measure macroscopic observables rather than microscopic ones . in this case",
    ", it is quite pertinent to ask wether the quantum correlations existent between the microscopic constituents of the systems will survive when the number of these constituents increases ? on the other hand , thermal states of interacting macroscopic systems , at finite temperature , are real classical states and the following question arises naturally : can interacting systems , initially in a thermal state , evolve to quantum entangled states ?",
    "these kind of issues relaunch the old question of the passage from quantum to classical behavior with increasing complexity of the systems and with increasing temperature @xcite .    beside this pure fundamental issue",
    ", macroscopic entanglement may become an important physical resource to perform communication and computation tasks with efficiency not achievable classically @xcite , with the great advantage ( comparing with microscopic entanglement ) of being created and manipulated in simple and accessible macroscopic systems , at room temperature .",
    "parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) processes have been used to visualize the quantum to classical transition at the single - mode single - photon level @xcite .",
    "experimental techniques , developed recently @xcite , detected quantum entanglement between bright squeezed vacuum beams ( containing about @xmath0 photons ) .",
    "this suggests that multimode pdc interactions are good candidates to study the joint effect of complexity and finite temperature , in macroscopic entanglement",
    ".    our perspective in this work will be to identify a small number of collective observables ( true physical quantities ) @xcite , that depend in the size ( number of microscopic constituents ) of the macroscopic systems and such that their measurement give information about the degree of macroscopic entanglement .",
    "we choose for collective observables the macroscopic amplitudes of two wave - packets of finite spectral bandwidth , generated in a multimode parametric down conversion process , in two different approaches : the _ pairwise _ and the _ one - to - all _ interactions .",
    "these macroscopic amplitudes are extensive quantities scaling with the number of the microscopic modes of the wave - packets , and are defined by the fourier transform of the amplitudes of the microscopic modes .",
    "the corresponding observables are macro bose operators of a two dimensional continuous variable hilbert space .    to measure the time dependent degree of entanglement of the bipartite macroscopic wave - packets we use the _ logarithm negativity _ and analyze its behavior in terms of the size of the wave - packets , and of the temperature of the nonlinear medium where the interaction takes place .    to give a pictorial representation of the physical interactions , we associate a graph @xcite with each interaction pattern and",
    "show that they are fundamentally different : while the graph of the _ pairwise _ interaction is composed of @xmath1 disconnected subgraphs whose vertices have degree @xmath2 , the graph of the _ one - to - all _ interaction is completely connected and its vertices have degree equal to the number @xmath1 of micro - modes in each wave - packet .",
    "this structural difference between the two graphs will be reflected in the behavior of the degree of macroscopic entanglement .",
    "we show that more complex is the system stronger is the macroscopic entanglement and higher is the critical temperature where it disappears .",
    "another interesting conclusion is that , at finite temperatures , the minimum interaction time needed for the wave - packets to be entangled decreases with increasing their complexity .",
    "our work extends previous studies with bright beams in three aspects : ( a ) our concept of a macroscopic system resides in the number of interacting microscopic modes ( degrees of freedom ) , rather than on the amount of photons produced during the interaction , and is valid for any finite number of micro - modes in each - wave packet .",
    "( b ) entanglement between macroscopic systems is detected through collective operators that retain the global properties of the bipartite gaussian , continuous variables macro - modes rather than computing multimode entanglement , ( c ) the effect of the temperature of the nonlinear medium on entanglement is taken into account , previous results only consider the initial vacuum state .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sec.2 we introduce the hamiltonean of the nonlinear interacting wave - packets in two different approaches and derive their dynamical behavior . in section 3",
    "we define the time - dependent collective amplitudes in terms of the microscopic ones . in section 4",
    "we compute the macroscopic degree of entanglement and the birth time of entanglement in terms of the number of micro - modes and of the temperature . finally in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions .",

    "per se _ the determinant factor when computing their degree of entanglement , the determinant ingredient is no doubt the type of interaction between their constituents .",
    "on the fundamental side our work demonstrates that , in principle , purely quantum correlations can be detected , at finite temperatures , by measuring a few number of appropriated collective observables of macroscopic systems .    to illustrate this behavior we studied the macroscopic quantum entanglement of the collective amplitudes of two wave - packets of finite spectral bandwidth , generated in a parametric down conversion process in two different approaches : the _ pairwise _ and the _ one - to - all _ interactions .",

    "this quite surprising behavior not only contradicts our naive intuition that quantum correlations are averaged out in macroscopic systems as it emphasizes that , the complexity of physical interactions between the microscopic constituents , can enhance the degree of macroscopic bipartite entanglement .",

    "<S> we investigate entanglement between collective operators of two wave - packets of finite spectral bandwidth , in two different approximations of the multimode parametric - down conversion ( mpdc ) process : the _ pairwise _ and the _ one - to - all _ interaction patterns . for collective operators we choose the macroscopic amplitudes of each wave - packet defined by the fourier transform of their microscopic mode amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this approach intends , to respond to realistic experimental conditions , where measurements apparatuses may not resolve single microscopic mode amplitudes but rather the collective amplitude of the wave - packets . to quantify the bipartite macroscopic entanglement we use the logarithmic negativity . </S>",
    "<S> we relate the time dependent degree of macroscopic entanglement with the complexity ( number of modes and interaction pattern ) and the temperature of the system . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the macroscopic entanglement increases linearly with the number of micro - modes in the case of the _ one - to - all _ interaction , while in the _ pairwise _ interaction it is constant . moreover , in the _ one - to - all _ pattern the _ birth time of entanglement _ and the critical temperature decrease with increasing the number of micro - modes . </S>",
    "<S> we draw the graphs associated with the two interaction patterns and related the degree of collective entanglement with the connectivity and the index of each vertex ( mode ) of the graph . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that quantum information and computation tasks may be achieved more efficiently by manipulating appropriated collective operators in some macroscopic systems , then by using their microscopic counterparts .    </S>",
