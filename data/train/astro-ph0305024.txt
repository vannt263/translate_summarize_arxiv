    "many recent research programs in galaxy evolution trace changes in correlations between fundamental galaxy properties as a function of cosmic epoch .",
    "one such approach compares the number density and luminosity function of galaxies at earlier times ( lilly  1995 ; bershady  1997 ; sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; lin  1999 ; ) to the luminosity function in the nearby universe ( zucca  1997 ; marzke  1998 ; norberg  2002 ) .",
    "evidence suggests an increase in the number density of small , blue galaxies at earlier times with only a small amount of passive fading among the more luminous , redder galaxies .",
    "other investigations compare the relation between rotation velocity and luminosity ( t - f relation ; tully & fisher 1977 ) locally with that observed in more distant disk galaxies ( e.g. , forbes  1995 ; vogt  1996 , 1997 ; simard & pritchet 1998 ) .",
    "most results indicate that galaxies of a given rotational amplitude appear 0.2 - 1.0 mag brighter at @xmath12 , although bershady ( 1998 ) argue that the variation is significant for only the bluest galaxies , and kannappan , fabricant & franx ( 2002 ) show that tully - fisher residuals are strongly correlated with galaxy color .",
    "simard  ( 1999 ) find no evidence for evolution of the size - magnitude relation among 190 field galaxies out to @xmath13 in the groth strip ( groth 1994 ) .",
    "they show that selection effects favor high surface brightness galaxies in existing surveys",
    ". these biases may mimic the appearance of luminosity evolution and/or surface brightness evolution reported in many studies ( schade  1996a , 1996b ; roche  1998 ; lilly  1998 ) .",
    "yet another line of investigation compares the fundamental plane correlations for early - type galaxies as a function of epoch .",
    "recent results suggest an decrease in the mean mass - to - light ratio with lookback time for elliptical galaxies ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ; kelson  1997 ) . in paper x of this series ,",
    "i m ( 2001 ) found a brightening of 1 - 2 mag for early - type @xmath14 galaxies out to @xmath12 .",
    "in this paper we focus on the evolution of the correlation between metallicity , @xmath15 , and total luminosity , i.e. , the luminosity - metallicity ( l - z ) relation to which nearly all types of _ local _ galaxies conform . in early - type systems ,",
    "absorption line indices provide a measure of the mean stellar iron or magnesium abundances ( faber 1973 ; brodie & huchra 1991 ; trager 1999 ) while in spiral ( zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) and dwarf systems ( lequeux  1979 ; french 1980 ; skillman , kennicutt , & hodge 1989 ; richer & mccall 1995 ) the  region oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen is the basis of metallicity measurement .",
    "the luminosity - metallicity relation ( l - z ) can be used as a sensitive probe and consistency check of galaxy evolution .",
    "the metallicity of a galaxy can only increase monotonically with time ( unless large - scale infall of primordial gas is invoked ) , while the luminosity may increase or decrease depending on the instantaneous star formation rate .",
    "metallicity is less sensitive to variations due to transient star formation events in a galaxy s history .",
    "most models and observations of galaxies at earlier epochs predict higher star formation rates and a larger fraction of blue , star - forming galaxies in the past ( madau  1996 ; lilly  1996 ; somerville & primack 1999 ) .",
    "thus , a high or intermediate - redshift galaxy sample ought to be systematically displaced from the local sample in the luminosity - metallicity plane if individual galaxies participate in these cosmic evolution processes . however , if local effects such as the gravitational potential and `` feedback '' from winds and supernovae regulate the star formation and chemical enrichment process , then the l - z relation might be independent of cosmic epoch .",
    "semi - analytic models of somerville & primack ( 1999 ) , for example , show very little evolution of the l - z relation with redshift .",
    "one goal of this paper is to provide data capable of testing these alternative hypotheses .    at high",
    "redshift , absorption line surveys have been tracing the chemical evolution of the lyman - alpha forest and damped lyman - alpha systems for more than a decade ( bergeron & stasiska 1986 ; sargent  1988 ; steidel 1990 ; pettini  1997 ; lu , sargent , & barlow 1997 ; prochaska & wolf 1999 ) , while several studies have recently begun to trace the cosmic chemical evolution of _ individual galaxies _ with known morphological and photometric properties .",
    "kobulnicky & zaritsky ( 1999 ) measured  region oxygen and nitrogen abundances for a sample of 14 compact starforming galaxies with kinematically narrow emission lines in the range @xmath16 .",
    "their sample was found to conform to the local l - z relation , within observational uncertainties .",
    "carollo & lilly ( 2001 ) studied 13 star - forming galaxies at @xmath17 from the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ; lilly  1995 ) and found no significant evidence for evolution in the l - z relationship out to z=1 .",
    "however , at larger redshifts of @xmath18 , both kobulnicky & koo ( 2000 ) and pettini  ( 2001 ) found that lyman break galaxies with metallicities between @xmath19 are 2 - 4 magnitudes more luminous than local galaxies of similar metallicity .",
    "this deviation from the local l - z relation demonstrates that the luminosity - to - metal ratio varies throughout a galaxy s lifetime and is a potentially powerful diagnostic of its evolutionary state .    the deep ( deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ; vogt  2003 ; paper i ) team has been assembling keck spectroscopic data on galaxies in the groth strip survey ( groth 1994 ) in order to study the evolution of field galaxies .",
    "previous papers in this series include a study of the evolution of the fundamental plane ( fp ) of early - type galaxies ( paper ix ; gebhardt  2003 ) , the evolution of the luminosity function of e / s0 galaxies ( paper x ; i m  2001 ) , and the structural parameters of groth strip galaxies ( simard  2002 ; paper ii ) . in this paper , we explore the chemical properties of 56 star - forming emission - line field galaxies observed as part of the deep groth strip survey ( dgss ) .",

    "is further reduced because 23 candidates were positioned on the slitmask such that the [ o  iii ] lines fell off the red end of the spectral coverage .",
    "an additional 49 objects were rejected because their position on the slitmask caused the [ o  ii]@xmath273727 line to fall off the blue end of the spectral coverage . furthermore , atmospheric @xmath30 absorption troughs between 6865    6920   ( the `` b band '' ) and between 7585    @xmath31   ( the `` a band '' ) prohibit accurate measurement of emission lines for objects in particular redshifts ranges .",

    "the spectra of objects rejected due to a weak @xmath33 line are usually dominated by stellar continuum rather than nebular emission from star - forming regions .",
    "most local early - type spirals and elliptical galaxies share these spectral characteristics . for these objects , h@xmath20 is seen in absorption against the stellar spectrum of the galaxy .",
    "thus early type galaxies with older stellar populations are preferentially rejected in favor of late type galaxies with larger star formation rates .",
    "there should , however , be no metallicity bias introduced by rejecting these 210 objects since we will compare the dgss sample with a local sample selected in the same manner : on the basis of emission lines measured with a signal - to - noise of 8:1 or better .    objects with strong @xmath33 but immeasurably weak [ o  ii ] or [ o  iii ] lines present a data selection conundrum . in principle",
    ", such objects should be included in the sample to avoid introducing a metallicity bias , but it is not possible to compute metallicities if the oxygen lines are not detected . only 3 such objects were found in the database . for these objects , it appears that poor sky subtraction caused the [ o  iii ] features to be immeasurably weak .",
    "intrinsically - weak oxygen lines may be caused by either extremely high ( @xmath37 ) or extremely low ( @xmath38 ) metal content . in the latter case ,",
    "oxygen lines are weak because of the lack of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ions . however , in the local universe , galaxies with extremely low intrinsic abundances are under - luminous ( @xmath41 ) , and no such faint galaxies are included in our sample . in the high - metallicity case , efficient cooling decreases the mean collisional excitation level , reducing the [ o  iii ] line strengths . however ,",
    "the balmer lines and [ o  ii ] lines are not strongly affected by reductions in electron temperature .",

    "examination of figure  [ hist ] reveals that the 66 galaxies selected for chemical analysis are representative of the entire deep sample in terms of their luminosities , redshift distributions , sizes , and bulge fractions , but they are preferentially bluer and more asymmetric than the sample as a whole .",
    "this disproportionate fraction of asymmetric galaxies with strong emission lines may be understood either 1 ) as mergers which trigger star formation and produce  regions , or 2 ) isolated galaxies dominated by star - forming regions which give rise to an asymmetric morphology .",
    "the possible systematic effects introduced by the selection criteria will be discussed further below .",

    "non - thermal sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) often produce emission - line spectra that superficially resemble those of star - forming regions .",
    "agn must be identified as such because blindly applying emission - line metallicity diagnostics calibrated from h  ii region photoionization models will produce erroneous metallicities .",

    "an alternative way of understanding our result is to say that field galaxies with @xmath128 have experienced a measurable degree of metal enrichment ( a factor of 2 ) at constant luminosity since @xmath129 .",
    "the arrows in figure  [ lzlim ] indicate the evolution in the l - z plane caused by constant star formation , passive evolution , metal - poor gas inflow , and star formation bursts and/or galaxy mergers .",
    "some combination of these processes are responsible for evolving the @xmath130 galaxies into the region occupied by today s @xmath131 galaxies .    the apparent evolution in the luminosity - metallicity relation seen in figures  [ lz ] and [ lzlim ] stands in contrast to the conclusions of kobulnicky & zaritsky ( 1999 ) and carollo & lilly ( 2001 ) who found little or no evolution in the redshift ranges @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "open squares in figure  [ lz ] show that the cl01 objects fall at the high - luminosity end of the luminosity - metallicity correlation where the local and `` distant '' samples overlap .",
    "a comparison of the cl01 objects to the local nfgs sample would find that they are likely to be drawn from the same distribution , and hence the conclusion of cl01 is appropriate given the restricted nature of that sample .",
    "the new conclusion based on figure  [ lz ] is made possible by the addition of larger numbers of galaxies and lower - luminosity galaxies which greatly extend the luminosity and metallicity baselines .",
    "although the kobulnicky & zaritsky ( 1999 ) sample included a broader range of luminosities , the least luminous objects were at the lowest redshifts where offsets from local galaxies are least pronounced .",
    "furthermore , kobulnicky & zaritsky ( 1999 ) used a local comparison sample that included only a restricted subset of of galaxies from the kennicutt ( 1992a , b ) spectral atlas .",
    "objects from this sample show increased scatter toward low - metallicities at fixed luminosity due , mostly , to the errors introduced by variable , unknown amounts of stellar balmer absorption .",
    "the increased scatter in the local sample masked the trend which has now become apparent in figure  [ lz ] .",
    "this evolution of the l - z relation between @xmath131 and @xmath134 supports the conclusions of kobulnicky & koo ( 2000 ) , pettini  ( 2001 ) and mehlert  ( 2002 ) who found high redshift galaxies to be overly luminous for their metallicity at @xmath135 .",
    "the addition of chemical information on galaxies at earlier epochs provides a new type of constraint on theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "if local effects such as the gravitational potential and `` feedback '' from supernova - driven winds are the dominant regulatory mechanisms for star formation and chemical enrichment , then the l - z relation might be nearly independent of cosmic epoch .",
    "the semi - analytic models of kauffman ( 1996 ) and somerville & primack ( 1999 ) show little or no evolution in the l - z relation with epoch , although model - dependent prescriptions for stellar feedback and galactic winds are poorly constrained and may have large impacts on the chemical and luminous evolution .",
    "based on the current understanding of cosmic evolution , that the volume - averaged star formation rate was higher in the past ( pei & fall 1995 ; madau 1996 ) , and that the overall metallicity in the universe at earlier times was correspondingly lower , we might expect galaxies to be considerably brighter at a given metallicity ( i.e. , luminosity evolution ) if there was more primordial gas available in the universe to fuel star formation .",
    "a high- or intermediate - redshift galaxy sample ought to be systematically displaced from the local sample in the luminosity - metallicity ( l - z ) plane _ if individual galaxies reflect these cosmic evolution processes , _",
    "i.e. , if they have an exponentially declining star formation rate since some epoch of formation , as commonly assumed , and/or if lower - mass galaxies evolve at different rates than high - mass galaxies .",
    "comparison of the data from figure  [ lz ] to some simple galaxy evolution models can help distinguish between these possibilities .    in a simple evolutionary model ,",
    "galaxies begin as parcels of gas which form stars and produce metals as the gas fraction decreases from 100% to 0% .",
    "the b - band luminosity is proportional to the star formation rate , which may vary as a function of time , but is generally believed to be proportional to the mass or surface density of the remaining gas ( kennicutt 1998 ) . for a galaxy that evolves as a `` closed box '' , converting gas to stars with a fixed initial mass function and chemical yield , the metallicity is determined by a single parameter : the gas mass fraction , @xmath136 .",
    "the metallicity , @xmath15 , is the ratio of mass in elements heavier than he to the total mass , and is given by    @xmath137    where @xmath138 is the `` yield '' as a mass fraction .",
    "a typical total metal yield for a salpeter imf integrated over 0.2100 @xmath139 is @xmath140 by mass ( i.e. , 2/3 the solar metallicity of 0.018 ; see pagel 1997 , chapter 8).8.7 based on the new solar oxygen abundance determination of prieto , lambert , & asplund ( 2001 ) .",
    "this is 0.1 - 0.2 dex lower than the oft - adopted anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) value , but resolves the discrepancy between solar and orion nebula oxygen abundances . for the orion nebula , @xmath141 , @xmath142 ( walter , dufour , & hester 1992 ) , which , given the calibration cited ( equation 3 ) , leads to @xmath143 , in excellent agreement with the prieto , lambert , & asplund ( 2001 ) measurement . ] a total oxygen yield for the same imf would be @xmath144 .",
    "effective yields in many local galaxies seem to range from solar to factors of several lower , ( kennicutt & skillman 2001 ; garnett 2002 ) , implying either that the nucleosynthesis prescriptions ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ) are not sufficiently precise , that assumptions about the form of the initial mass function are incorrect , or that metal loss is a significant factor in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "garnett ( 2002 ) finds that oxygen yields of @xmath145 to @xmath146 among local irregular and spiral galaxies are correlated with galaxy mass , suggesting an increasing amount of metal loss among less massive galaxies .",
    "high - velocity winds capable of producing mass loss are observed in local starburst galaxies ( e.g. , heckman  2000 ) and in high - redshift lyman break galaxies ( pettini  2001 ) , but the actual amount of mass ejected from galaxies is difficult to estimate .",
    "simulations indicate that winds may be metal - enriched , such that metals are lost from galaxies more easily than gas of ambient composition ( vader 1987 ; de young & gallagher 1990 ; maclow & ferrara 1999 ) .",
    "recent chandra observations of a local dwarf starburst galaxy , ngc  1569 , provide the first direct evidence for metal - enhanced outflows ( martin , kobulnicky , & heckman 2002 ) .",

    "we tried a range of sfr prescriptions , including constant and exponentially declining star formation rates , for preconstituted galaxies of a fixed gas reservoir . in each case , both the initial star formation rate and total gas reservoir available had to be carefully tuned in an arbitrary manner to produce gas exhaustion at just the right epoch to account for the similarity of the @xmath134 and the local relations at the highest luminosities .",
    "by the time the evolution in the l - z plane slowed when the gas supply neared exhaustion at @xmath149 , the model galaxies all had several times the solar metallicity , in conflict with the @xmath131 and @xmath134 observations .",
    "we next tried a more physically motivated prescription , where the star formation rate is proportional to the mass of accumulated gas ( or the gas density ; schmidt 1959 ; kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "galaxies are built by infall of primordial - composition gas with an infall rate that declines with an exponential timescale , @xmath150 , as implemented in pgase2 ,    @xmath151    we chose two representative gas infall timescales of 1 gyr and 5 gyr and two representative total gas masses of @xmath152  and @xmath153 .",

    "objects that form in regions of lower cosmological overdensity would accrete gas on longer timescales and , if isolated from external influences , would proceed more slowly through the star formation and chemical evolution process . a longer formation timescale for lower mass field galaxies observed in the dgss at @xmath112 can plausibly explain the observed evolution in the l - z relation .",
    "such a scenario , whereby galaxies assembly timscales vary with environment , is similar to that proposed by sandage , freeman , & stokes ( 1970 ) to explain the differences along the hubble sequence .",
    "an additional free parameter not easily incorporated into the pgase2 models is the role of starbursts on timescales of few myr that occur in a galaxies evolving on long ( gyr ) timescales according to the model prescriptions above .",
    "studies of local galaxies show that their star formation histories are not smooth but instead are punctuated by periods of enhanced activity .",
    "such short - term enhancements in the star formation rate of galaxies otherwise evolving smoothly can elevate the luminosity and emission line equivalent widths by factors of several .",
    "the observed emission line equivalent widths in dgss galaxies average 10 - 20  , but some exceed 50 ! these characteristics would be better fit by superimposing a burst of star formation of @xmath164  on the model galaxies .",
    "the impact of instantaneous bursts on the evolution in the l - z plane would be to create spikes along the model tracks toward higher luminosities .",
    "the amplitude of the spikes would scale with the amplitude of the burst , and could conceivably be several magnitudes and would persist for few 100 myr . given the morphological evidence for ongoing mergers among the dgss sample , evidenced by inspection of figure  1 , it seems certain that short - term enhancements in the star formation rate are responsible for the more extreme luminosities and emission line equivalent widths among the sample .",
    "examination of the pgase2 models used here shows that as the @xmath62 declines from 50   to 10  , the b - band luminosity drops by 0.7 mag .",
    "if we were to try to correct the magnitudes of the dgss samples by some factor to account for their larger equivalent widths compared to the local samples , this factor would be less than 0.7 mag , not enough to account for the larger 1 - 2 mag offsets observed in the l - z relations .",
    "figure  [ lzevt ] shows schematically what the evolution in the l - z plane may look like as a function of redshift .",
    "lines at @xmath131 and @xmath134 are drawn to match the formal fits to the data in these redshift bins .",
    "the other hypothetical lines are drawn to indicate a possible evolutionary trend in the l - z relation which is consistent with the ( currently minimal ) observational constraints .",
    "this schematic shows more clearly than figure  [ lzevp ] the more pronounced evolution for low - mass galaxies compared to high mass galaxies and illustrates the increasingly rapid evolution at redshifts beyond @xmath165 .",
    "figure  [ lzevt ] may be approximated by an analytical function which expresses metallicity in terms of luminosity , @xmath49 , and redshift , @xmath48 as    @xmath166 m_b + ( -2.31 z + 6.18).\\ ] ]    in terms of the metallicity by mass , @xmath15 , an equivalent expression is    @xmath167 m_b + ( -4.9 z -6.9),\\ ] ]    where @xmath168 .    because this schematic is based upon observations of luminous ( @xmath83 ) , metal - rich ( @xmath169 ) galaxies , it may be inapplicable to the least luminous , metal - poor galaxies where the behavior of the l - z relation may change ( e.g. , melbourne & salzer 2002 ) .",
    "extrapolation beyond the current luminosity and redshift data is imprudent .",
    "observations of star - forming galaxies from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) survey of groth strip galaxies in the redshift range @xmath170 show a correlation between b - band luminosity and oxygen abundance , like galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the l - z relations for @xmath1710.8 intersects with the l - z relation at @xmath131 for the most luminous ( @xmath172 ) dgss and local galaxies .",
    "there appears to be very little evolution in the l - z plane among these most luminous galaxies over the last 8 gyr",
    ". however , less luminous ( and by implication , possibly less massive ) galaxies are 1 - 2 mag more luminous at @xmath173 than @xmath131 galaxies of similar metallicity . said another way , galaxies of comparable luminosity are 0.1 - 0.2 dex more metal - rich at @xmath131 compared to @xmath134 .",
    "the least luminous galaxies appear to undergo considerable evolution in the l - z plane .",
    "this differential evolution can be explained in one of two ways . either less luminous ( less massive ? ) galaxies are assembled on longer timescales than the super @xmath14 galaxies , or they begin their formation process at a later cosmic epoch .",
    "evolution of galaxies in the l - z plane over the redshift range @xmath174 to @xmath131 appears to be a combination of fading and chemical enrichment for plausible models .",
    "loss of up to 50% of the oxygen appears to be necessary to avoid over - enriching the galaxies at the observed redshifts .",
    "because the local comparison sample has been been selected on the same emission - line basis as the intermediate - redshift samples , accounting for differences in color , this result is consistent with evolution in the luminous and chemical properties of star - forming galaxies over the last 4 - 8 gyr .",
    "how does this result compare to conclusions about the evolution of the luminosity function ( lf ) ?",
    "lin  ( 1999 ) use early cnoc2 data on @xmath175 galaxies over the redshift range @xmath176 to conclude that , among late - type galaxies ( the ones most comparable to the dgss objects selected here ) , changes in the lf are most consistent with _ density _ evolution , and little or no _ luminosity evolution_. however , cohen ( 2002 ) , based on studies in the hubble deep field north vicinity over the redshift range @xmath177 , concluded that emission - line objects show _ moderate luminosity evolution _ and _ little density evolution_. interpreting figure  5 of lin ( 1999 ) as luminosity evolution suggests that , between @xmath178 and @xmath179 , late - type galaxies with @xmath114 fade by @xmath1801 mag , while galaxies with @xmath181 fade by @xmath182 mag .",
    "this is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the amount of fading required for the @xmath134 dgss galaxies to match the local l - z relation in the models in figure  [ lzevp ] .",
    "these results imply that @xmath183 dgss galaxies must have significantly higher ( 20%-80% ) gas mass fractions than comparably luminous local galaxies .",
    "such a difference in the mean gas mass fractions of galaxies would , in principle , be observed with instruments such as the proposed radio - wave square kilometer array .",
    "new optical and near - ir spectroscopic observations can test the schematic predictions of figure  [ lzevt ] by measuring oxygen abundances of objects fainter than @xmath184 in the critical redshift range @xmath185 to @xmath165 ( i.e. , by filling in the low - luminosity side of figure  [ lzevp ] ) .",
    "we thank john salzer for insightful conversations and for providing the kiss data in electronic form , shiela kannappan for a helpful discussion about the nfgs , matt bershady and james larkin for scientific inspiration .",

    "<S> using spectroscopic data from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) groth strip survey ( dgss ) , we analyze the gas - phase oxygen abundances for 56 emission - line field galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies comprise a small subset selected from among 693 objects in the dgss . </S>",
    "<S> they are chosen for chemical analysis because they exhibit the strongest emission lines , and thus have the highest star formation rates per unit luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen abundances relative to hydrogen range between @xmath1 with typical uncertainties of 0.17 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the 56 dgss galaxies collectively exhibit a correlation between b - band luminosity and metallicity , i.e. , an l - z relation . using the dgss sample and local galaxy samples for comparison , we searched for a `` second parameter '' which might explain some of the dispersion in the l - z relation . </S>",
    "<S> parameters such as galaxy color , emission line equivalent width , and effective radius were explored but found to be uncorrelated with residuals from the the mean l - z relation . </S>",
    "<S> the source of the dispersion in the l - z relation is either intrinsic or depends upon a yet - unidentified combination of parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> subsets of dgss galaxies binned by redshift also exhibit l - z correlations but with different zero points . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath2 ) are brighter by @xmath3 mag compared to the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath4 ) and brighter by @xmath5 mag compared to local ( @xmath6 ) field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this offset from the local l - z relation is greatest for objects at the low - luminosity ( @xmath7 ) end of the sample , and vanishingly small for objects at the high - luminosity end of the sample ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both the slope and zero point of the l - z relation appear to evolve . </S>",
    "<S> based on the dgss galaxies , we provide an approximate analytic expression for the mean gas - phase metallicity of galaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift  a recipe that may aid in modeling the properties of cosmologically distant galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> emission - line field galaxies have undergone moderate amounts of evolution in the past @xmath9 gyr since z@xmath10 , and the evolution is most significant for galaxies of lower luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> either the least - luminous dgss field galaxies have faded by 12 mag due to decreasing levels of star formation , or they have experienced an increase in the mean metallicity of the interstellar medium by factors of 1.32 ( 0.1 - 0.3 dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> plausible evolutionary models suggest that a combination of the two processes is likely </S>",
    "<S> . the relatively greater degree of luminosity and metallicity evolution seen among the lower luminosity ( sub @xmath11 ) galaxies in the last 8 gyr implies either a more protracted assembly process , or a more recent formation epoch compared to more luminous @xmath11 galaxies .    </S>"
