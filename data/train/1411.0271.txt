    "quantum coherence or quantum superposition is one of the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics that distinguishes the quantum world from the classical world .",
    "it is one of the main manifestation of quantumness in a single quantum system . for a composite quantum system , due to its tensor structure",
    ", quantum superposition could directly lead to quantum entanglement , another intriguing feature of quantum mechanics and the very important physical resource in quantum information processing [ 1 ] . in fact , safely speaking , quantum coherence is one necessary condition for almost all the mysterious features of a quantum state .",
    "for example , both entanglement and quantum discord that has attracted much attention recently [ 1 - 10 ] , have been shown to be quantitatively related to some special quantum coherence [ 11,12 ] . however",
    ", when a quantum system undergoes a noisy quantum channel or equivalently interacts with its environment , the important quantum feature , i.e. , the quantum decoherence , could decrease .",
    "it is obvious that whether decoherence happens strongly depends on the quantum channel and the state itself , but definitely a quantum channel describes the fate of quantum information that is transmitted with some loss of fidelity from the sender to a receiver .",
    "in addition , if the subsystem of an entangled state passes through such a channel , disentangling could happen and go even more quickly .",
    "decoherence as well as disentangling for composite systems has never been lack of concern from the beginning .",
    "a lot of efforts have been paid to decoherence in a wide range such as the attempts of understanding of decoherence [ 13,14 ] , the dynamical behaviors of decoherence subject to different models [ 15 - 20 ] , the reduction or even prevention of decoherence [ 21 - 23 ] , the disentangling through various channels and so on [ 24 - 26 ] .",
    "actually , most of the jobs can be directly or indirectly summarized as the research on to what degree a noisy quantum channel or the environment influences ( mostly destroys ) the coherence , the fidelity or entanglement of the given quantum system of interests .",
    "so it is important and interesting to consider how to effectively evaluate the ability of a quantum channel that leads to decoherence , the loss of fidelity of a quantum state , or disentangling of a composite system , in particular , independent of the state .    in this paper , we address the above issues by introducing three particular measure , the decoherence power , the infidelity power and the disentangling factor to describe the abilities , respectively .",
    "this is done by considering how much fidelity , coherence or entanglement ( for composite systems ) is decreased by the considered quantum channel on the average , acting on a given distribution of quantum state or the subsystem of an entangled state .",
    "this treatment has not been strange since the entangling power of a unitary operator as well as the similar applications in other cases was introduced [ 27,28 ] .",
    "however , because the calculation of the abilities of a quantum channel strongly depends on the structure of the quantum states which undergo the channel , the direct result is that only 2- dimensional quantum channel can be effectively considered . for the high dimensional quantum channels",
    ", one might have to consider these behaviors on a concrete state , which is analogous to that the entangling power can be only considered for the systems of two qubits [ 27 ] .",
    "these cases will not be covered in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we treat the quantum channel as the reduction mechanism of the fidelity and present the infidelity power accompanied by some concrete examples . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider how to influence the coherence of a state and give the decoherence power .",
    "some examples are also provided . in sec .",
    "iv , we analyze the potential confusion if we consider the decoherence of a mixed state and briefly discuss how to consider the influence of quantum channel on the subsystem of a composite quantum system . the conclusion is drawn in sec .",
    "when a quantum state undergoes a quantum channel , the state will generally be influenced .",
    "although some particular features of the state could not be changed , the concrete form of the state , i.e. , the fidelity , is usually changed . in order to give a description of the ability to which degree",
    "a quantum channel influences a quantum state , we would like to first consider the infidelity power of a quantum channel .    with fidelity of two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 mentioned , one could immediately come up with the fidelity defined by @xmath2 or the trace distance defined by @xmath3 with @xmath4 [ 29 ] .",
    "however , consider some given distribution of state @xmath0 , one can find that the mentioned definitions are not convenient to derive a state - independent quantity .",
    "so we would like to consider another definition of the fidelity based on frobenius norm @xmath5 .    _",

    "the infidelity power can be directly defined as the difference of fidelity before and after going through the channel subject to some given distribution . however , different distributions would lead to quite different infidelity power . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the uniform distribution .      in order to describe the difference between the fidelities of the state @xmath31 with and without quantum channel @xmath16 , we can use @xmath32consider the uniform distribution @xmath33 of the state @xmath0 [ 27 ] , we can define the infidelity power as follows .",

    "@xmath69 , if @xmath70 , or @xmath71 .",
    "this is because @xmath57 will become @xmath72 or its dual quantum channel on this condition .",
    "it is a natural conclusion that @xmath73 reduce the fidelity due to @xmath74 , in particular , with the increase of the decay rate @xmath75 , the infidelity power is increasing .",
    "but it is not difficult to find that given @xmath75 , the ability of reducing the fidelity can be weakened if we adjust @xmath76 for the generalized amplitude - damping channel . the minimal infidelity power is obtained if @xmath77 .",
    "for a given density matrix , the definition of quantum coherence depends on not only the density matrix itself , but also the bases on which the density matrix is written . to evaluate whether there exists quantum coherence in a quantum state ,",
    "physically one has to find some observables to reveal the interference by measuring them .",
    "it can be shown that all the quantum states ( density matrices ) but the maximally mixed state can demonstrate interference because one can always find such an observable that can reveal it so long as the observable does nt commute with the density matrix of interests .",
    "based on such a think , one could find various ways to defining quantum coherence .",
    "here we would like to define the maximal distance between the density matrix of interests and the corresponding maximally mixed state with all potential bases taken into account .",
    "the rigorous formulae can be given as follows .",
    "_ definition 3_.-quantum coherence for an @xmath9-dimensional density matrix @xmath0 is defined as the maximal distance between @xmath0 and the maximally mixed state @xmath78 with all potential bases considered , i.e. ,    @xmath79    where @xmath80 denotes the @xmath9-dimensional identity .",
    "@xmath81 is also the maximally potential coherence within all possible bases .    _",
    "the density matrix @xmath0 in a different framework can be given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the unitary transformation relating two different bases of @xmath0 .",
    "so the distance @xmath81 can be written as@xmath84where @xmath85 is the frobenius norm .    in other words ,",
    "given a basis in which the density matrix is written by @xmath31 , the coherence in this basis can be described completely by the off - diagonal entries of @xmath86 [ 11 ] .",
    "so if we extract the maximal contribution of coherence with different basis considered , we have @xmath87 _ { ij}^{2 } \\notag \\\\ & = & tr\\rho ^{2}-\\min_{u}\\sum_{k}\\left [ u\\rho u^{\\dagger } \\right ] _ { kk}^{2 }   \\notag \\\\ & = & tr\\rho ^{2}-\\frac{1}{n}.\\end{aligned}\\]]eq . ( 33 ) holds because one can always find a unitary matrix such that @xmath88 have the equal diagonal entries .",
    "it is obviously shown that our definition actually quantify the maximal coherence of a state by considering all the possible bases [ 11 ] .",
    "the proof is completed.@xmath89    from the definition , one will easily see that such a distance does not depend on the bases , i.e. , the unitary matrix @xmath83 .",
    "this does not contradict with the usual statement of the dependence of bases for quantum coherence .",
    "in fact , the dependence of bases is in that the different observables chosen to reveal the interference will lead to the different interference visibilities .",
    "this actually implies the ability of the observable that can reveal the quantum coherence of the given state , instead how much quantum coherence could be revealed for a state .",
    "in addition , it is obvious that the maximal value of the coherence measure is @xmath90 which can be attained by all the pure states .",
    "it is easy to understand because all the pure states are equivalent or interconverted under appropriate unitary transformations .",
    "it is obvious that eq .",
    "( 31 ) is also closely related to the purity of a quantum state , the quantumness of a single state , so the coherence measure can also be understood as the purity measure or the quantumness measure etc . with a small potential deformation [ 30,31 ] .    with this definition , we can proceed to consider a quantum system with the state @xmath0 undergoes a quantum channel @xmath16 with the final state can be given by @xmath91 .",
    "thus the coherence of the final state @xmath91 can be easily written as@xmath92 ^{2}-\\frac{1}{n}.\\]]for the latter use , next we would like to present a new form that separates the quantum state and the quantum channel in eq .",

    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , one can directly obtain@xmath93thus eq . (",
    "35 ) shows that the left quantum coherence of @xmath0 when it passes through the quantum channel @xmath16 .",
    "so the decoherence power that describes to what degree the decoherence has been reduced can be defined as the difference of the coherence before and after the channel subject to some distribution of quantum states .",
    "based on the above analysis , we can obtain the following definition for decoherence power .",
    "_ definition 4_. the decoherence power of the @xmath9-dimensional quantum channel @xmath16 can be defined as@xmath94with @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97 denotes the measure over the pure state @xmath0 induced by the uniform distribution @xmath98 .    from this definition",
    ", we should first note that we only consider the distribution of pure states instead of the whole state space .",
    "why we do nt cover mixed states will be analyzed in the latter part . in addition , one can find that @xmath99 analogous to infidelity power does not depend on the concrete form of a density matrix but only the dimension of the density matrices and its structure .",
    "however , due to the same reason as the infidelity power , we only present the concrete expression of @xmath100 for a system of qubit .",
    "_ theorem 2_. the decoherence power of the quantum channel @xmath16 on a qubit can be given by@xmath101with @xmath102    _ proof .",

    "since we suppose the state is distributed uniformly , the state density can be given by @xmath104 .",
    "so one can easily find that@xmath105thus , @xmath106it is equivalent to eq .",
    "the proof is completed.@xmath15      similarly , we also calculate the decoherence power for a qubit of the depolarizing channel @xmath51 , the phase - damping channel @xmath53 , the amplitude - damping channel @xmath55 and the generalized amplitude - damping channel @xmath57 . based on the analogous calculation to those in eqs .",
    "( 27 - 30 ) , we have @xmath107as is expected again , we can find that @xmath108 will vanish if @xmath109 .",
    "however , unlike the infidelity power which is a monotone function of @xmath75 , the decoherence power of all the mentioned channels but the phase - damping channel will reach a maximum at some particular @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "this should be distinguished from the case where only the coherence in a fixed basis is considered .",
    "in fact , eq . ( 35 ) is suitable for all quantum states including mixed states when we consider the decoherence of a state through a channel .",
    "however , it is not hard to see that in the sense of the previous definition of coherence , the reduction of coherence depends on not only the quantum channel itself , but also the quantum state that undergoes the channel .",
    "so it is possible that a given quantum channel could reduce the coherence of some states and increase the coherence of the other states .",
    "thus the decoherence power will lead to confusion since it is defined as the average contribution of the reduction of coherence subject to a given state distribution . in order to demonstrate the inconsistent roles of a quantum channel on different states",
    ", we would like to take the above three quantum channels as examples to show the reduction and increase of the coherence .",
    "actually , one can find that the coherence of any states based on definition 1 will be reduced if they undergo the depolarizing channel @xmath51 and the phase - damping channel @xmath53 .",
    "but the amplitude - damping channel could lead to the increase of the coherence . in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the two regions within and without which the coherence of all the states can be reduced and increased , respectively .    .",
    "the outer ball represents all the states of a qubit .",
    "the inner spheriod denotes the states that loses coherence via the channel .",
    "the two balls inscribe at point @xmath111 ]      since the direct consideration of decoherence of mixed state could lead to the confusion , we have to consider the mixed states in an indirect way , namely , we turn to an entangled bipartite composite system of a pure state with one of its subsystems undergoing a quantum channel .",
    "it is obvious that the reduced density matrix of any subsystem is mixed ; in addition , any local quantum channel on the subsystem will always reduce the entanglement of the composite system since a good entanglement measure should be an entanglement monotone . however , it should be noted that the decoherence based on disentanglement is different from our initial definition 1 .",
    "strictly speaking , we actually characterize the reduction of a special coherencequantum entanglement . in this sense , what we consider should be called as the disentangling power instead of the decoherence power of the original definition 1 .",
    "consider a bipartite pure state of two qubits @xmath112 , the entanglement can be reduced if one subsystem undergoes a quantum channel @xmath16 .",
    "if we employ concurrence [ 32 ] as entanglement measure , one can easily find that [ 33 ] @xmath113with @xmath114 .",
    "so no matter what distribution of quantum states is considered , the concurrence is directly reduced by the factor @xmath115 .",
    "thus the disentangling power of @xmath16 in this case can be directly characterized by @xmath116 .",
    "in addition , if @xmath117 is a mixed state , one can also consider the reduction of entanglement subject to some quantum channel .",
    "however , due to the complicated expression of concurrence for mixed states .",
    "so far there has not such a factorial form of the reduction of entanglement .",
    "in this paper , we study how a quantum channel influences the fidelity and the coherence of a state when the state goes through it and briefly discuss the reduction of entanglement when a subsystem undergoes a channel .",
    "we give the infidelity power and decoherence power of a quantum channel .",
    "they are independent of quantum states and describe an average contribution of the infidelity and the decoherence . as applications ,",
    "we calculate the infidelity power and decoherence power of depolarizing channel , phase - damping channel , amplitude - damping channel and generalized amplitude - damping channel , respectively .",
    "we show that although quantum channels ( if it is not trivial ) definitely reduce the fidelity of the state through it and the entanglement with subsystems through it , for some channels , they could increase the coherence of some states .",
