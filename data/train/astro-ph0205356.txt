    "those few bright , relatively local pulsars exhibiting a well resolved pair of conal components have had major influence on our conception of pulsar radio emission .",
    "they represent only a handful of the 1000 + stars now known , and some of their original `` b '' designations come easily to the tongue : b0301 + 19 , b0329 + 54 , b0525 + 21 , b1133 + 16 , b1237 + 25 , b2020 + 28 , and b204516 , having each been the subject of sundry studies over the years .",
    "this small group comprises the finest examples of stars exhibiting a monotonic increase of total profile width , or conal component - pair spacing , with wavelength . such behavior , noted in the earliest efforts to systematize and understand pulsar radio emission ( _ e.g. _ komesaroff 1970 , komesaroff , morris & cooke 1970 , lyne , smith & graham 1970 ; sieber , reinecke & wielebinski 1975 ; cordes 1978 ) , has generally been regarded as primary evidence that the lower frequency radio emission is emitted at higher altitudes in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "while this phenomenon , known as `` radius - to - frequency mapping '' ( hereafter rfm ) , is clearly exhibited by many pulsars , it is particularly marked in lower frequency ( @xmath2@xmath3100 mhz ) observations .",
    "consequently , it is only a few local ( low dispersion ) objects that can be observed over the 810-octave frequency range needed to examine its character in adequate detail .    thorsett ( 1991 ) nicely summarizes the early history of the rfm discussion : observationally , it rapidly became clear that no simple curve fitted the measurements , so that the component - pair width ( or separation ) behavior ( as longitude intervals @xmath4 , 360@xmath5 corresponding to one rotation period @xmath6 ) was usually described by fitting power - law functions @xmath7 to the asymptotic high and low frequency values .",
    "theorists , meanwhile , began to predict various dependences for the rfm  the height proportional to @xmath8 relation encountered in models where the characteristic emission frequency is equated to the plasma frequency ( such as for curvature radiation)being the most often encountered .",
    "later studies suggested that the index @xmath9 varied continuously with frequency ( _ i.e. _ rankin 1983b ; hereafter paper ii ) and , therefore , that no single power - law relation could describe the overall behavior ( slee , bobra & alurkar 1987 ) .",
    "thorsett then evaluated two simple generalizations of a single power - law @xmath10 @xmath11 ( where @xmath2 is the radio frequency ) and found that they fitted his measurements equally well .    over this same period , ideas developed regarding the geometrical significance of these prominent component pairs .",
    "first , they were demonstrably _",
    "conal_that is , they represented a relatively central sightline traverse through a hollow - conical emission pattern ( rankin 1983a ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "second , the magnetic latitude @xmath12 and sightline impact angle @xmath13 could be estimated by various techniques ( _ e.g. _ lyne & manchester 1988 ) , taking the polarization - angle ( hereafter pa ) sweep rate @xmath14 to be @xmath15 ( radhakrishnan & cooke 1969 ; komesaroff 1970 ) . and",
    "third , these conal beam radii assumed particular dimensions in terms of the polar cap radius , which in turn suggested specific emission heights ( rankin 1993a , b ; hereafter paper via , b ) .",
    "surprisingly , few attempts have been made to amalgamate these discussions , to the end that questions relating to the frequency dependence of width ( or separation ) can be explored in the context of a specific emission geometry .",
    "two such attempts are those of xilouris _ et al _  ( 1996 ) and von hoensbroech & xilouris ( 1997b ) which we will discuss further below .",
    "clearly , a much more appropriate quantity with which to assess the rfm is the conal beam radius @xmath16 ( which has primary geometrical significance ; see paper via : fig .",
    "2 ) , rather than the various observed intervals of longitude @xmath4 ( which conflate the accidental geometry of the observer s sightline ) . moreover , once @xmath16=@xmath17 has been determined , the emission height @xmath18 can easily be estimated ( assuming a dipolar magnetic field geometry ) , so that the rfm can be assessed directly as a frequency - dependent height relation @xmath18=@xmath19 .",
    "our purpose in the remainder of this paper is then a ) to combine measurements used by thorsett with more recent and accurate profile observations , b ) to study their implications in the context of an appropriate geometrical model , and c ) to draw what physical conclusions we can from the results of these analyses .",

    "our profile measurements were taken both from those sources identified by thorsett ( see his table i and the references therein ) and from more recent published and unpublished work .",
    "these additional sources are listed below table  [ tbl-2 ] and include high quality arecibo observations at between 25 mhz and 6 cm ( hankins , rankin & eilek 2002 ) .",
    "the various observations were reduced to sets of profile measurements using a combination of hand - scaling and , where appropriate , fitting gaussian functions to the relevant components ( see kramer 1994 ; kramer _ et al _  1994 ) . in all cases",
    "we were interested in a ) the half - power ( 3-db ) widths of the respective components , b ) the separations between the centers of the component pairs , c ) the full profile widths at the outside half- and 1/10-power points , and d ) reasonable error estimates of these values . in practice the outside half - power ( 3-db )",
    "points were determined separately for the two components as their amplitudes were usually different ( see backer 1976 ; figs .",
    "2c , d ) . generally , we found the fitting more useful to locate the component centers for the separation measurements , but in many cases the 3-db profile widths could also be accurately estimated by summing the component - pair separation and half the sum of their fitted widths . as can be seen in the following plots and tables , it was usually possible to estimate a given quantity in several different ways ( including making use of thorsett s independent values ) , so that there is a good deal of redundancy in our measure values .",
    "the errors in the widths @xmath41 were estimated wherever possible by using the formal errors of the gaussian fits , which it turn were based on well determined values of the noise in the off - pulse region of the profile .",
    "where hand - scaling was used , the errors were again estimated from the quality of the profile and the off - pulse rms - noise level .",
    "most previous attempts to understand how the widths of profile components vary with frequency have only proved frustrating .",
    "until the last decade or so , no pulsar s profiles were well enough measured  particularly at low frequency  that this important issue could be addressed with any confidence .",
    "as the brightest star in the sky with two well resolved profile components , pulsar b1133 + 16 ostensibly offers the best possible context for studying its component - width behavior , but rankin s ( paper ii ) effort to draw conclusions from the then available profile data ( see her fig .",
    "5 ) , we will now see , was inconclusive and misleading in its suggestion of a monotonic increase of width with wavelength  though izvekova _",
    "et al _  ( 1993 ) , a decade later , were able to discern a nearly invariant behavior over a narrower frequency range .",
    "the lower portion of figure  [ fig:1133wdt ] gives a pair of component - width spectra for b1133 + 16 , where the values for the leading ( i : asterisks ) and trailing ( ii : circles ) components are plotted according to the `` component width '' scale . while these width values are hardly constant , they do not begin to mimic the monotonically varying profile - width curves in the upper part of the figure .",
    "though we see discrepancies among the well measured values ( _ e.g. , _ around 400 mhz ) , most of the values are roughly compatible , within their errors , with a constant width at frequencies above about 40 mhz : 2.2@xmath5@xmath420.6@xmath5 and 3.2@xmath5@xmath420.9@xmath5 for components",
    "i and ii , respectively . only below 40 mhz and around or above 3 ghz do the component - widths diverge from these values .",
    "further , the increases below 50 mhz appear to be just what might be expected from instrumental effects .",
    "scattering broadening also becomes important for these low dispersion measure @xmath43 objects at low frequencies , but it is usually quite clear when it is the dominant effect , because of its steep @xmath44 dependence . at the lowest frequencies the necessarily narrow",
    "filter bandwidths @xmath45 entail risetimes which become comparable to the dispersion smearing  so that the minimum achievable ( non - coherently dedispersed ) resolution escalates as @xmath46 .",
    "if the filter risetime @xmath47 is of the order of @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is a small positive value ) , and the dispersion smearing @xmath50 goes as @xmath51 , then for optimum choices of parameters @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "we find that @xmath54 is about 145@xmath55^{1/2}f(\\rm mhz)^{-3/2}$ ] . table  [ tbl-1 ] gives the frequencies @xmath56 at which this limiting resolution represents a longitude of @xmath57 ( for @xmath49=1 ) .",
    "were then @xmath49 very reasonably some 24 , we can understand the width escalation for 1133 + 16 at and below 50 mhz as instrumental in origin .",
    "we have thus corrected the low frequency width values for this limited resolution ( taking @xmath49 to be about 3 ) on the plots and in our subsequent analyses .",
    "the lower curves of the plots in figure  [ fig : psrwdts ] give component - width spectra for six additional stars , exactly as did the b1133 + 16 plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:1133wdt ] .",
    "apart from the strange `` step '' in b0301 + 19 , we see a relatively constant component - width behavior .",
    "no pulsar exhibits a width escalation with wavelength which at all mimics the corresponding profile behavior in the upper panels . in order to further understand the frequency dependence of the component widths , we fitted power - law curves of the form @xmath58 , where @xmath2 is in ghz .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] then gives the resulting parameters over ( in some cases ) several ranges of frequency .",
    "most of the stars have one component  and both for b0525 + 21 and b1237 + 25which exhibits and an essentially constant width within the errors . only for b204516",
    "do we see a clear spectral trend for both components  or , in other words , where @xmath59 appears significant . more often , the widths are `` noisy '' , varying somewhat both at a given frequency and unsystematically over the entire observed band .",
    "we can see that even with our corrections , some of the lowest frequency values remain anomalously large .",
    "it is possible that scattering becomes a factor , but more likely these lowest frequency profiles are `` smeared '' by unknown instrumental factors which are not completely correctable .",
    "therefore , only when future coherently dedispersed observations at very low frequencies become available can we interpret them with full confidence .",
    "we see no evidence for the leading or trailing component to be larger . there may be some tendency for the components to narrow at the highest frequencies  perhaps resulting in the largest widths in the mid - frequency range . though this trend hardly significant for any particular star ( perhaps for b2020 + 28 ) , we find the very smallest widths in the extreme high frequency profiles in about half of the cases ( see also fig .",
    "3 ) .    in considering the width variations ,",
    "it is also very possible that one or both of the two components are composite , with modal contributions that may have somewhat different temporal and spectral behaviors .",
    "indeed , there is now increasing evidence that these conal components are comprised of modal contributions which have somewhat different angular dependences ( see , for instance , rankin _",
    "et al _  1988 ; ramachandran _ et al _  2002 ; as well as paper viii in this series ) , and were these to overlap increasingly in the often somewhat narrower high frequency components , it could account for the progressive average depolarization that characteristically occurs there ( _ e.g. _ mckinnon 1997 ) .",
    "we have entertained whether the cases of possible high frequency component narrowing might be associated with `` breaks '' in the radio - frequency spectra for these stars .",
    "such features have been identified in the spectra of b0301 + 19 ( 0.9 ghz ) , b0525 + 21 ( 1.5 ghz ) , b1133 + 16 ( 2.0 ghz ) , b1237 + 25 ( 0.7 ghz ) , b2020 + 28 ( 2.3 ghz ) and b204516 ( 0.5 ghz ) ( malofeev 1994 , 2001 ; maron _ et al _  2000 ; mckinnon 1997 ) . for all but the second ,",
    "the turndown frequencies seem roughly compatible with their width spectra , but more careful work will be required to fully demonstrate this association .",
    "_ we conclude that these well measured component widths are virtually constant with frequency , apart from a slight tendency to narrow at high ( @xmath601 ghz ) frequencies . _",
    "as mentioned earlier , the conal beam radius @xmath16 is a far more appropriate quantity by which to assess rfm questions , as it is a fundamental descriptor of a star s emission geometry . if we assume a _",
    "circular _ emission beam , then when the magnetic latitude @xmath12 and sightline impact angle @xmath13 are known , we can compute @xmath16 using the spherical geometry relation first given by gil ( 1981 ) @xmath61 where @xmath62=@xmath12+@xmath13 .",
    "@xmath12 can be estimated either using the techniques of lyne & manchester ( 1988 ) or the core - component - width method of paper iv , wherein the 1-ghz core width @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "fortunately , for the three stars here with core components , the two methods agree very closely .",
    "pulsars b0301 + 19 , b0525 + 21 , b1133 + 16 and b2020 + 28 have no detectable core components and thus the second method can not be used to determine @xmath12 .",
    "however , paper vi found that cones have definite angular dimensions in terms of the polar cap radius , and these four pulsars all seem to have what were called `` outer '' cones with 1-ghz , half - power radii of @xmath65 .",
    "so here we can work backwards , given a particular conal type , by then finding the value of @xmath12 which squares with the characteristic 1-ghz value of @xmath16.10 may not have the usual significance .",
    "@xmath12 must be nearly 90@xmath5 if r is as large as 8 .",
    "we used the somewhat smaller values in table 1 . ]",
    "secondly , we estimate the impact angle @xmath13 as @xmath66 , where @xmath14 ( = @xmath67 ) is the maximum sweep rate .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] lists the values of @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath68 ( at 1 ghz ) as taken from paper vi . as we do not know the sign of @xmath13 for any of the stars of interest here , we have proceeded as if @xmath13 could be of either sign  and the difference affects our results so little that it has been accommodated within the stated errors .",
    "assuming that @xmath13 , @xmath16 and @xmath4 are small and independent , the error @xmath69 in @xmath16 can be calculated by propagating the errors @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( given in table  [ tbl-1 ] ) as , @xmath73 where @xmath74=@xmath75 , @xmath76=@xmath77 , and @xmath78=@xmath79 .",
    "with these considerations in mind we can now compute @xmath16 and @xmath69 from @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath4 .",
    "we wish to fit the resulting @xmath16 values in order to study their frequency variation , but we have no _ a priori _ means of knowing how they will behave  or in our practical terms , what an appropriate fitting function might be . however",
    ", for some pulsars ( with small @xmath68 , such as b1237 + 25 ) , we know that the @xmath16 and @xmath4 behavior can not be very different , so that a `` recycled '' empirical thorsett expression may well serve adequately for the @xmath16 fitting also @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are constants in degrees and degrees-@xmath83 , respectively .    the upper portions of figures  [ fig:1133wdt ] and [ fig : psrwdts ] give the respective measured values , along with their errors , for the component separation , outside half - power ( 3-db ) profile width , and the outside 10% width of the seven primary stars in consideration .",
    "note that these primary data are plotted according to the slightly non - linear longitude scale on the inside , upper left of the diagrams .",
    "the computed conal beam radii are then plotted per the linear `` beam radius '' scale on the outside , upper left of the plots .",
    "these three primary measures , of course , refer to somewhat different positions on the conal emission beam ( as well as incurring slightly different geometrical factors ) , and so they may or may not behave similarly when fitted .    in order to carry out the non - linear least - square - error analysis , we used the levenberg - marquardt method as implemented in the _ numerical recipes _ routines ( press _ et al _  1986 ) , fitting all three profile measures : separations , half - power widths , and 10% widths .",
    "we first tried unconstrained , 3-parameter fits and found that while the thorsett expression fitted the profile measurements adequately  that is , with @xmath84 values near unity  the parameters were all highly correlated .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] summarizes the fitted parameters , normalized correlation coefficients , reduced @xmath84 values , and number of fitted points @xmath85 , for some of these fits .",
    "the correlations between @xmath81 and @xmath82 ran between + 0.74 and + 0.93 , those between @xmath82 and @xmath9 around 0.98 , and the third one also negative and intermediate in magnitude .    in an effort to provide some physical constraint on the fitting function , we attempted to interpret @xmath81 , the infinite - frequency value of @xmath16 , in terms of the field direction at polar cap edge @xmath86 .",
    "this @xmath0 is associated with the `` last open field lines '' and may or may not represent the radius of the `` active '' region on the stellar surface , but it seemed meaningful to ask whether such a small asymptotic value could be compatible with the overall frequency dependence of the conal beam radius .",
    "moreover , we do not know which profile measure , if any , might correspond to this outer boundary of the polar cap .",
    "therefore , we explored the behavior of all three .",
    "it was thus surprising to find that upon fixing @xmath81 as @xmath0 , very adequate fits were obtained for four stars , b0301 + 19 , b0525 + 21 , b1237 + 25 and b204516 ( hereafter group a ) .",
    "the results are given at or near the top of each section in table  [ tbl-3]with the fixed @xmath81 values shown in boldface  and the three respective fits for each pulsar are hardly better in one case or the other as judged by the @xmath84 values .",
    "it thus seems that the a - group stars are insensitive to assumptions about what point on their profiles corresponds to the `` last open field lines '' .",
    "the a - group @xmath82 values are well beyond the highest frequency observations , reflecting the fact that it is only here that the second term in eq.([eq4 ] ) declines to a value of 1@xmath5 .",
    "qualitatively , we see this behavior clearly in figs .",
    "[ fig:1133wdt ] and [ fig : psrwdts ] as the a - group measures continue to decrease at the highest frequencies ( in marked contrast to the remaining stars , which approach an asymptotic width at high frequency ) .",
    "then , we asked whether reasonable fits for the a - group stars could be obtained if @xmath81 was fixed as above _ and _ the index @xmath9 was set to the ( plasma frequency associated ) value of @xmath87and the answer was negative .",
    "we give these fitting results only in terms of the component separation , and the corresponding entries in table  [ tbl-3 ] show that the @xmath84 values fall far above unity .",
    "finally , we asked whether fixing @xmath9 at @xmath87 was compatible with the observations if the constraint on @xmath81 was relaxed , and our results for the separation measure appear just under the foregoing ones . again , to our surprise , we found that these fits were very acceptable ( slightly better than those obtained by constraining @xmath81 ) , with values of @xmath81 well larger than @xmath0 by factors of between @xmath88 and 3 .",
    "however a similar exercise for psrs b0329 + 54 , b1133 + 16 and b2020 + 28 ( hereafter group b ) shows a very different behavior .",
    "the first group of ( separation ) results quoted for these stars in table  [ tbl-3 ] represents the unconstrained fits . for these stars ,",
    "the parameters are slightly better determined as @xmath81 and @xmath82 are only about 80% correlated .",
    "this is so because here the @xmath16 values saturate rather rapidly with frequency_i.e .",
    "_ at 300 mhz or so  as can be seen by the very different @xmath82 values for the b - group stars . again , apart from the half - power width fit for b1133 + 16 ( where @xmath84@xmath264 ) , the profile measure has very little effect on the fitting quality",
    "as might be expected from the qualitative behavior , no acceptable fits could be obtained for the b - group stars when @xmath81 was constrained to @xmath0 . when the index @xmath9 was fixed at @xmath87 as above though",
    ", table  [ tbl-3 ] shows that all the @xmath84s fall just above the acceptable range .",
    "moreover , the @xmath81 values are all about 3 times greater than @xmath0 , just as for the a - group stars .",
    "the @xmath82 values remain low , 210 times those for the free fits , and representing frequencies within the range observed .",
    "_ summarizing then , conal beam radii computed from the three profile measures are well fitted by eq.([eq4 ] ) with unconstrained parameters , though with very high correlations . only for",
    "the a group , however , do acceptable fits obtain when @xmath81 is fixed at @xmath0 or @xmath9 to 1/3 . _",
    "figure  [ fig : psraddl ] gives similar displays for three additional pulsars , b0834 + 06 , b160400 and b1919 + 21 .",
    "all exhibit a very different behavior  a near constancy of their profile dimensions .",
    "et al _ s ( 1975 ) study found , for b0834 + 06 and b1919 + 21 , a slight width escalation both above and below about 200 mhz , trends which can be seen in our plots as well .",
    "of course , this behavior does not permit fitting eq.([eq4 ] ) to the profile measures , so instead we plot lines showing the best - fitting constant values .",
    "overall , the separation is virtually fixed for these objects within their errors .",
    "the profile width measures show somewhat more variation , in part reflecting changes in the component widths , which tend to be largest at intermediate frequencies .",
    "the one - parameter fitting results for these stars are given in table  [ tbl-3 ] as group c.    the ostensible complete lack of rfm in these group c stars is so striking in contrast to the foregoing a- and b - group pulsars that it demands further inquiry .",
    "a hint comes from b160400 , whose triple * t * profile s core - component width can be determined accurately ( rankin 1986 ) , and modeling its emission geometry ( paper vi ) indicates that its conal component pair represents an inner cone .",
    "the star s three primary components overlap , but they can be segregated either polarimetrically or by gaussian fitting . here",
    "the high quality arecibo profiles of hankins _ et al _  ( 2002 ) have been especially useful .",
    "no core component has been identified in the other two group - c pulsars , so it is not possible to be as definite about their geometry ; however , the overall structure of both could well be of the inner - cone type .",
    "pulsar b0834 + 06 was analyzed as having an inner cone in paper vi ; whereas the complexity of b1919 + 21 s emission ( _ e.g. _ , prsynski & wolszczan 1986 ) then tended to suggest a double - cone structure  in turn then implying an outer cone  but with recent evidence for one smaller `` further - in '' cone ( gil _ et al _  1993 ; rankin & rathnasree 1997 ; gangadhara & gupta 2001 ; hereafter g&g ) , b1919 + 21 s conal structure could still be of the inner type .",
    "interestingly , the width spectra of these three stars  with demonstrated or probable inner - cone configurations  have very much in common with what is known about the inner cone behavior in the double - cone , five - component * m * pulsars that were studied in paper vi .",
    "unfortunately , only three , b1237 + 25 , b145168 and b185726 , have been studied sufficiently well over a wide enough frequency range to give even a qualitative indication of inner - cone separation spectra .",
    "these data are tabulated in paper vi , table 3 , and for the first two stars it can be seen that the inner cone , half - power pair widths are either nearly constant or much more slowly varying than the corresponding outer conal pair . for b1857@xmath8926 , the existing observations provide only the qualitative impression that the inner cone dimensions remain relatively constant .",
    "one additional means of attempting to confirm this striking lack of rfm in inner conal component pairs is that of examining the behavior of other stars , like b160400 , with inner - cone triple * t * profiles .",
    "we found in paper vi that about half the * t * stars had inner cones ( 23 of 40 ) , and recent observations  particularly by gould & lyne ( 1998 ; hereafter g&l)now provide good quality profiles over a wide enough band ( 1642 to 234 mhz ) to see if their conal configurations change very much . a full analysis of this question goes beyond the scope of this paper , because most of the inner cone * t * stars will require fitting to accurately locate their components .",
    "however , we can get a useful qualitative impression . of the 22 pulsars apart from b160400 ( and using g&l , hankins _",
    "et al _  2002 , and the sources in paper vi ) , 13 stars , b014916 , b0450 + 55 , b045018 , b0919 + 06 , b122163 , b1508 + 55 , b1541 + 09 , b170219_m _ , b170616 , b172747 , b174746 , b181804 , and b1839 + 09 , have profiles in which the inner - conal pair spacing changes hardly at all .",
    "further , none of the 9 others provides a contrary example ( most have not been observed at low enough frequency , are scattered , or are simply too weak to bear on the question ) .    _",
    "the conclusion then seems inescapable : the conal beams comprised by inner cones exhibit virtually no rfm  that is , inner conal component pairs show little or no change in their longitude separation  in turn implying that the inner conal beams which produce them have radii that vary little or hardly at all with frequency . _ the rfm behavior of the outer cones of groups a and b and the inner cones of group c ( and the other stars mentioned above )",
    "could hardly be more different .",
    "the former exhibit the rather dramatic rfm which has attracted the attention of many investigators ; whereas , the ostensibly similar inner cones ( differing only in their distinct characteristic angular size relative to that of the polar cap @xmath0 ) show no discernible rfm at all .",
    "let us now compare the results of the above analysis with the earlier published work on conal beam dimensions .",
    "we mentioned above the conclusion ( paper vi ) that most conal beams have two characteristic outside , half - power radii , @xmath90 } = 4.33\\deg[5.75\\deg ] p^{-1/2}$ ] at 1 ghz .",
    "in addition , there are further results from gil _ et al _  ( 1993 ) , kramer _ et al _  ( 1994 ) , rankin & rathnasree ( 1997 ) , mitra & deshpande ( 1999 ) , and gangadhara & gupta ( 2001 ) .",
    "in analyzing their profile - dimension information , these authors used different measures , and now , using our analysis tools , we can find a relationship between them .",
    "we have seen above that the various measures fit the respective profiles with somewhat different parameters . however , the largest part of this difference is in the very different spectral behavior of the 3-db and 10% component widths .",
    "as these widths are fairly constant , very similar values for @xmath82 and @xmath9 should be obtained in fitting any of the three profile measures ; the difference will appear almost entirely in @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , we proceed here by imposing values of @xmath82 and @xmath9 , obtained from fitting the separations , on the profile - width fits in order to study their relationship .    specifically , for the a - group pulsars , we imposed @xmath82 and @xmath9 values , obtained from the @xmath81=@xmath0-constrained , component - separation fits in order to obtain the best fitting values of @xmath81 , @xmath91=@xmath0 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "we computed @xmath94 and @xmath95 for each star , and found that the ratios were in reasonable agreement , yielding an average value of @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the 10% point on the conal beam seems to fall twice as far from the peak as from the half - power point .",
    "a similar ratio can be gleaned from the results of gil _ et al _  ( 1993 ) , whose ensemble 3-db and 10% points fall at 5.52@xmath5@xmath420.5@xmath5 and 6.33@xmath5@xmath420.5@xmath5 , respectively , in relation to a peak value at 4.6@xmath5 .",
    "this dependence is not far from that of a gaussian curve , where the half - power point falls at 0.55 that of the 10% point .",
    "a similar procedure was carried out on the group b and c stars ( without the @xmath81=@xmath0 constraint ) . for the b group ,",
    "the component - separation fit values can be imposed on the other two measures only if some high and low frequency values are omitted ( because of changes in the component widths ) , and for the c group only an overall @xmath81 can be defined .",
    "the average values of the ratios was thus 0.42@xmath420.1 and 0.45@xmath420.1 for group b and c , respectively  slightly lower perhaps than for the gaussian curve .",
    "_ overall then , we conclude that conal beams have a roughly gaussian dependence in @xmath16 . _",
    "we now consider the implied heights of emission , assuming first a dipole structure for the stellar magnetic field , and second that the emission at a given frequency arises from the same altitude above the center of the 10-km neutron star .",
    "the radio emission height @xmath18 can thus be computed as @xmath97 then , since @xmath16 is a function of frequency as given by the neo - thorsett relation eq .",
    "(  [ eq4 ] ) , the dependence of @xmath18 on frequency  rfm mapping  can be studied directly .",
    "the upper portions of all the foregoing figures show this computation of @xmath18 on their outside , right - hand scales in units of the ( putative 10-km ) stellar radius @xmath98 .",
    "because our analysis used values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 estimated by one of us ( paper vi)which in turn used the convention of associating the emission with the `` last open field lines''the 1-ghz , 3-db - width heights for the group a and b stars ( all shown or thought to be outer cones ) in these figures are all just over 200 km .",
    "the heights corresponding to the separation and 10% widths are consequently smaller and larger , respectively .",
    "it is certainly possible to relate the fitting data in terms of @xmath16 [ eq.([eq4 ] ) ] to the height expression above . in that @xmath99",
    ", the fitting function must be squared , and the uncertain effect of the cross term complicates interpretation .",
    "a more transparent approach is that of fitting the frequency dependence of @xmath18 directly . in",
    "that we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath18=@xmath19 , we want to assess this approach to ensure that our results are meaningful .",
    "again , we try a version of thorsett s relation @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are constants in units of km and ghz - km@xmath103 , respectively .    in order to fit eq.([eq7 ] ) we used the separation measure , as use of the others would lead to similar results , while raising the complications discussed above .",
    "the results of the fits are summarized in table [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "the fitting procedure was identical to that for eq.([eq4 ] ) above .",
    "once again , the unconstrained , 3-parameter fits are presented first for both the group a and b stars , and both give uniformly good @xmath84 values .    in an effort to understand our earlier fitting results for @xmath16=@xmath17",
    ", we attempted to test the situation where @xmath101 is fixed to @xmath98 ( corresponding to @xmath16=@xmath0 ) and the index @xmath104=@xmath105obtaining unsatisfactory fits ( not shown ) for both the a and b groups ( @xmath84@xmath26200 for the latter ) .",
    "however , the middle set of a - group results shows that decent fits do obtain with @xmath101 set to @xmath98 , but with @xmath104 values somewhat different than @xmath105 .",
    "then we asked if reasonable fits are obtained if @xmath101 is constrained to @xmath98 and @xmath104 to the plasma - frequency - associated value of @xmath106 , and again the answer was negative for both groups . however , if @xmath101 remains unconstrained , very reasonable fits are obtained for all the a - group stars as reported in table  [ tbl-4 ] , though the resulting @xmath101 values are 510 times larger than @xmath98 . in comparing these results with the heights inferred from the corresponding @xmath81 values in table  [ tbl-3 ] where @xmath9=1/3",
    ", we find that the latter are only slightly smaller  suggesting that the overall effect of the cross - term is small .",
    "finally , we turn to the b group and carry out the same fitting procedure , first freeing all three parameters and then fixing only @xmath104 at @xmath106 . surprisingly , reasonable fits were obtained in both cases , the former having only slightly lower values of @xmath84 as shown in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "recall that when group b fits were made for @xmath16 in table  [ tbl-3 ] , holding @xmath9=@xmath87 , the results were were rather poor .",
    "_ it is indeed remarkable that by fitting @xmath18=@xmath19 directly using eq.([eq7 ] ) , both the a- and b - group stars exhibit a consistent behaviour with the index @xmath104=@xmath106 and with @xmath82 values falling in a relatively narrow range between about 50 and 150 km .",
    "these fits suggest that only an index value near @xmath106 could accommodate the different characteristics of the a and b groups . _",
    "the height estimates made by one of us in paper vi are in need of revision .",
    "the convention there of associating the outside 3-db points of the component pairs with the full polar cap radius ( or the `` last open field lines '' ) is not very physical , first because the electric field @xmath107 is expected to vanish along this boundary and second because we are interested in the effective height of the emission region , not its lower edge .    a better convention",
    ", we now believe , is that of associating the emission with an active annulus on the polar cap .",
    "this is furthermore compatible with an @xmath108@xmath109@xmath110 origin of subbeam circulation in b0943 + 10 ( deshpande & rankin 1999 , 2001 ; asgekar & deshpande 2001 ; rankin , suleymanova & deshpande 2002 ) and is implicit in ruderman & sutherland s ( 1975 ; hereafter r&s ) theory .",
    "it also follows from the recent aberration / retardation ( hereafter a / r ) delay analyses of b0329 + 54 by malov & suleymanova ( 1998 ; hereafter m&s ) and g&g . to this end",
    "we can modify eq.([eq6 ] ) to include the parameter @xmath111 , giving the fractional radius of the `` active '' annulus on the polar cap ; see eq.([eq8 ] ) below ( also kijak & gil 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the a / r studies argue that @xmath111@xmath1120.5 , implying that the @xmath18 values given by eq.([eq6 ] ) are low by factors as large as 4 .",
    "@xmath113    specifically , for b0329 + 54 , m&s used 0.0610.7-ghz observations and g&g 325- and 610-mhz observations to estimate their emission heights .",
    "measuring the conal component spacings relative to the central ( core ) component ( which is thought to be emitted at low altitude along the magnetic axis ) , and interpreting them as due to a / r delay , appropriate emission heights could be computed .",
    "further , g&g reported that four pairs of conal components could be identified in the star s pulse sequences , which in turn exhibited progressive and symmetrical amounts of a / r delay .",
    "our outer - cone analysis refers to their cone 3 ; whereas , m&s considered only this outer cone .",
    "the resulting conal emission heights at 103/111 , 325 and 610 mhz are then some 945@xmath4255 , 770@xmath42110 , and 600@xmath42180 km , respectively , with respect to the core emission height . using our separation measure",
    ", we find conal emission heights of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 km , respectively .",
    "comparing these values using eq.([eq8 ] ) , we find an average @xmath111 of 0.56@xmath420.1 ; however , were the core emitted at a significant height , the former values would be increased by this amount and the resulting @xmath111 values consequently decreased .",
    "almost a decade earlier , blaskiewicz , cordes , and wasserman ( 1991 ; hereafter bcw ) developed a method of estimating emission heights using the slight aberrational shift of the pa traverse relative to the profile center ; and they then applied their technique to a group of stars for which they had obtained exceedingly well measured polarization profiles  and a few of their pulsars are common to our sample . then , more recently , von hoensbroech & xilouris ( 1997b ) applied the same technique to another group of stars at somewhat different radio frequencies , and they also considered several stars of interest here .    using the above results , three height values for b0301 + 19 were available at various frequencies , which could be compared with our ( separation ) height relation [ table 4 ; eq.([eq7 ] ) ] via eq.([eq8 ] ) to determine the parameter @xmath111 . given our picture that a single active annulus on the stellar polar cap produces a cone of active field lines ( which then radiate at different heights ) , it follows that @xmath111 should be a ( frequency - independent ) constant for a given pulsar .",
    "the measured b0301 + 19 @xmath111 values are 0.96@xmath420.3 , 1.3@xmath420.3 , and 0.23@xmath420.2 at 410 , 1410 and 4850 mhz , respectively  giving a weighted average of 0.66@xmath420.15 .",
    "the five available values for b0525 + 21 , 0.88@xmath420.3 , 0.66@xmath420.2 , 0.76@xmath420.1,0.41@xmath420.15 and 0.53@xmath420.12 at 430 , 1410 , 1418 , 1710 and 4850 mhz , respectively , yield a weighted - average @xmath111 of 0.63@xmath420.06 . for b1133 + 16 , five further values , 0.85@xmath420.3 , 0.61@xmath420.1 , 0.82@xmath420.3 , 0.72@xmath420.1 and 0.62@xmath420.1 at the same frequencies , give 0.61@xmath420.06 . for b204516 , only a 4850-mhz exists , 0.54@xmath420.1 .",
    "while there is considerable variation in the various individual @xmath111 estimates , the weighted - average ( outer cone ) @xmath111 values all fall within a narrow range between about 1/2 and 2/3 .",
    "we can now adjust the nominal 1-ghz , outer - cone , emission height of paper vi in light of the above results , first by using the component - separation measure and second an appropriate @xmath111 value .",
    "the effect of the first issue can be estimated by comparing the 3-db and separation height values at 1 ghz for a - group pulsars b0525 + 21 , b1237 + 25 and b204516 , and we find that the latter value is some 152@xmath427 km ( rather than the about 220-km value based on 3-db widths ) .",
    "the actual physical height is then @xmath117 times this value  or some 610@xmath4225 km if @xmath111 is 0.5 or some 345@xmath4217 km if @xmath111 is 0.67 .",
    "these outer - cone values are to be compared with the inner - cone emission heights of the group c pulsars , which are both smaller and virtually invariant . here , comparing the 3-db versus the separation widths in table 3 , we find an average ratio of some 0.89 , which makes the nominal inner - cone emission height ( using the separation measure ) some 104@xmath426 km [ as opposed to the paper vi ( 3-db width ) values of 130 km ] .",
    "this nominal inner - cone height , when adjusted as above by @xmath117 , gives physical emission - height values between 415 and 235 km .",
    "finally , wright ( 2002 ) has suggested that the outer - cone emission region is associated with the last open field lines , whereas the inner - cone region is along the `` null '' surface ( goldreich & julian 1969 ; r&s ) at @xmath111=@xmath118=0.74 .",
    "if so , then the above arguments would suggest a physical 1-ghz , outer - cone emission height of 152@xmath427 km as well as an inner - cone height of 104@xmath426 km , scaled by @xmath117 , which is 191@xmath4211 km .",
    "note that this places in the 1-ghz inner - cone emission at a greater height than the 1-ghz outer - cone radiation , though rfm would reverse the situation at most lower frequencies .",
    "_ thus , we conclude that the 1-ghz emission heights @xmath90}$ ] are 23 times larger than the respective 130[220]-km values of paper vi , when referred to the component separation and adjusted for a `` mean '' @xmath111@xmath260.6 .",

    "we have seen above that , overall , the conal component widths exhibit a surprisingly constant spectral behavior .",
    "however , we also see some possibly significant variations , and we here explore whether these can be understood in terms of the overall conal emission geometry .    @lr@    at any given frequency , we can use the 3-db width together with the component separation to compute the _ radial _ half width of the conal emission beam @xmath120 as @xmath121 where @xmath91 is the beam radius computed using the separation and @xmath122 that from the 3-db widths .    assuming both that @xmath18 is a monotonic function of @xmath2 and",
    "that a given component is associated with a specific ( uniformly illuminated ) bundle of field lines ( perhaps because a cone of `` emission columns '' connects the stellar surface to the emission region along them ) at a given height , we can ask whether the flaring of the ( presumed ) dipolar magnetic field is sufficient to be observed . in this geometry",
    ", the angle @xmath123 between the annular emission region and the magnetic axis can be expressed in terms of the height @xmath18 as @xmath124 .",
    "then , we can find @xmath125 , the radial ( half - power ) thickness of a thin annulus of `` active '' field lines at height @xmath18 as @xmath126    now we construct a model curve using eq.([eq10 ] ) , where @xmath127 is estimated at the highest available frequency  relative to a nominal @xmath111 value of 0.6by matching @xmath125 to @xmath120 . then , keeping @xmath127 constant , @xmath125 can be calculated using eq.([eq10 ] ) where the height @xmath18 is obtained from the component separation and using eq.([eq8 ] ) with @xmath111=0.6 . on the other hand , @xmath120",
    "can now be estimated using eq.([eq9 ] ) and this value compared with the corresponding dipolar flaring angle @xmath125 to study the deviations from a dipolar geometry .    in figure",
    "[ fig : flare ] we plot both the @xmath125 model and the @xmath120 widths versus @xmath18 for most of the outer - cone stars .",
    "( b0301 + 19 was omitted because of its strange `` step '' , and b2020 + 28 and b204516 owing of their limited @xmath18 ranges . )",
    "the curves indicate the dipole - flaring model ( @xmath125 ) bounded by @xmath127@xmath42@xmath128 , whereas the open circles ( @xmath120 ) show what flaring is seen in the observed fits .",
    "both quantities entail errors in both @xmath18 and @xmath16 , which are included in the bounding curves ( @xmath128 ) or explicitly indicated . for most of the pulsars ( including the excluded b2020 + 28 and 204516 )",
    "the agreement between these flaring estimates is rather good . for b0329 + 54",
    "the model works particular well , which in turn is compatible with the a / r analyses of m&s and g&g .",
    "thus , any component narrowing at the highest frequencies can be understood as an angular narrowing in the radial ( magnetic `` zenith angle '' @xmath123 ) thickness of the emitting annulus ( or cone ) of field lines  though in some cases this may be compensated by the obliqueness of the sightline `` cut '' across the cone as @xmath68 increases with frequency .",
    "note that we have assumed here that @xmath111 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "this is only true if the emission cone is uniformly illuminated at all frequencies , and scales in the way given by eq.([eq10 ] ) .",
    "deviations from either of the assumptions would lead to a frequency dependent @xmath111 .",
    "this effect may be refected in fig .",
    "[ fig : flare ] , where the observed flaring ( open circles ) is consistently either lower or higher than the computed flaring ( shaded ) region .",
    "b1133 + 16 is the only star for which there is a significant discrepancy , possibly owing to its remarkably large value of @xmath68 . ignoring the lowest frequency ( 25 mhz ) heights ( where some scattering or instrumental effects may contribute ) ,",
    "the width escalation at the lowest heights is much too steep to be dipole flaring ; whereas , between 50 and 100 @xmath98 , the @xmath111=0.6 model works well .    _ in summary , assessment of whether these outer - cone beams flare in a dipolar manner depends critically on quality low frequency ( large height ) observations , which often remain problematic . though the @xmath111=0.6 flaring model works well ( except for b1133 + 16 as above ) , the b0525 + 21 analysis suggests a flaring which is less than dipolar .",
    "_ higher quality observations at the lowest possible frequencies are needed to resolve the flaring issue .",
    "in the foregoing sections we have attempted an analysis of the conal component - pair dimension information for a set of 10 pulsars , the seven exemplars previously studied by thorsett ( 1991 ) as well as three other prominent stars with very different characteristics . in carrying out our analysis , we have placed our focus on the angular scales of the ( presumed circularly symmetric ) conal emission beam pattern , not , as have most authors before us , on the longitude dimensions of the profiles .",
    "computation of the beam sizes requires geometrical information which can perhaps yet only be estimated approximately ; however , for most of these stars the very different approaches of lyne & manchester ( 1988 ) and one of us ( paper vi ) give quite similar results .",
    "in assessing what may be the most extensive set of well measured conal component - pair widths , we find that overall these widths vary little with frequency .",
    "we do observe some gentle narrowing at high frequencies in one or both of the components in some stars , a feature which was also observed by sieber _",
    "et al _  ( 1975 ) .",
    "we also find that some components appear to broaden at the very lowest frequencies , but here either instrumental effects or scattering can not yet be ruled out .",
    "it will be interesting , as coherent dedispersion techniques are more regularly applied to very low frequency observations over the next few years , to explore this question in further detail .",
    "because of these various sources of weak variation in the component widths , the profile - width measures which include them  the half - power ( 3-db ) or 10%-width measures  we find , are more or less problematic indicators of the profile - scale variations . therefore , our profile - scale analyses are based on the component - separation measure .",
    "our fitting , using the modified thorsett relation eq.([eq4 ] ) , of the conal beam radii @xmath16 results in three strongly contrasting types of behavior .",
    "four of the seven thorsett stars exhibit continuously varying component separation , where , remarkably , the best - fit values of @xmath81 are only 23-times larger than the angular radius of the polar cap @xmath0 and the index @xmath9 takes values near 0.45 .",
    "three other stars have component separation values which seem to `` saturate '' at very high frequencies .",
    "their best - fit values of @xmath81 are 34 @xmath0 and the @xmath9 values are substantially steeper . then , in completely contrast to both these groups , we find three stars which exhibit almost no component - separation variation at all .",
    "the first two behaviors are apparently exhibited by stars with outer - cone component pairs ; whereas , the three examples of near constancy are all plausible or demonstrable examples of inner - cone component pairs . in regard to the first two groups , the a group can be well fitted by the `` plasma frequency '' index value of 1/3 , but the b group cannot  and we have been unable to identify any geometrical circumstance that might account for the differences .",
    "we have also entertained whether higher - order contributions to the magnetic field configuration might account for them  but , if so , why should we see two types of behavior rather than many ? certainly ten stars by no means provides an adequate statistical sample , but a preliminary examination of 9 further pulsars suggests that these too divide between the three groups .    furthermore ,",
    "while the overall success of the modified thorsett relation in fitting the profile - width spectra is satisfying , it remains merely an empirical relation .",
    "how then are we to understand the very necessity of the @xmath81 term ? and how could the index @xmath9 of the thorsett equation have physical implications similar to those attributed to simple power - laws of the same index ?",
    "a somewhat simpler picture emerged when we fitted the separation - determined @xmath18 values as a direct function of @xmath2 using eq.([eq7 ] ) .",
    "the stars of both groups a and b could be fitted well with this relation , though the indices @xmath104 for the latter group were substantially steeper .",
    "for the a group it was possible to impose an @xmath101 value of 10 km ( @xmath98 ) , without altering @xmath84 very much .",
    "the real surprise , however , was that both groups could be fitted exceedingly well with an imposed index value of 2/3 .",
    "these latter fits ( see table 4 ) have @xmath101 values of between 5 and 15 times @xmath98 .    noting that emission heights computed from half - power widths in relation to the `` last open field lines''as in paper vi  are not very physical , we suggest that more realistic values will come from the use of the component separation in relation to an annulus of `` active '' field lines about half way out on the polar cap , @xmath111@xmath260.5 . such considerations lead to the conclusion that the 1-ghz outer - cone emission comes from a height of around 500600 km ( as opposed to 220 km in paper vi ) , whereas the inner - cone emission stems from a height of some 400500 km ( _ c.f . _",
    "the first range agrees well with the several independent emission - height determinations that are based on relativistic effects  which we summarized for those stars in our groups .",
    "we have attempted to understand the component - width variations in terms of spectral changes in @xmath68 and the height - dependent flaring of a dipolar magnetic field .",
    "the analysis seems largely consistent with such flaring ( but depends critically on the difficult low frequency observations ) , and one pulsar suggests no flaring at all . clearly , our study lends no simple support to the premise that the leading members of a component pair will be broadened by aberration ( ahmadi & gangadhara 2002 ) .",
    "we are uncertain about how the strength and structure of the pulsar magnetic field might affect the radio emission heights .",
    "it may be that the magnetic field configuration in the emission region will usually be nearly dipolar , and that closer to the surface there will always be non - dipolar effects [ as the multipole field will not decay over the pulsar s lifetime ( mitra _ et al _  1999 ) ] .",
    "this will influence the gap heights in all vacuum - gap models  implicitly in the r&s theory and explicitly in later work as by , for instance , muslimov & tsygan ( 1992 ) or gil & mitra ( 2001 ) .",
    "( it will also complicate interpretation of the @xmath111 parameter . )",
    "further , non - dipolar fields will increase the binding energy of the ions on the stellar surface ( abrahams & shapiro 1991 , gil & mitra 2001 ) , which is by far the most problematic issue in forming gaps in pulsars .    in several theories",
    "we might expect the gap height to have an inverse relationship with the @xmath129-field strength , and thus , the emission region which is argued to be proportional to the gap height , may start at a lower altitude in pulsars with stronger fields ; however , here the field in question must be the total field in the gap region , including both the dipolar and non - dipolar contributions .",
    "we note that two of the a - group stars have ( spindown - determined , meaning dipolar ? ) field strengths of @xmath2610@xmath130 gauss , while none of the b- or c - group star fields are this high ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . that many interpulsars seem to emit from both poles almost equally is also worth remembering , in that it implies that gaps can be formed above polar caps of either sense ( with accelerated charges of either sign?)and perhaps the two gap senses give rise to the two rfm types ( a and b ) observed above .",
    "a major impetus for this work was that of trying to forge a better overall understanding of `` rfm mapping '' to facilitate its physical interpretation .",
    "the summary of xilouris _ et al _  is very useful , but we have been unable to locate any full theoretical discussion of rfm [ excepting that of barnard & arons ( 1986 ) , which predicts no rfm at all ] .",
    "returning to r&s , we find that those stars which exhibit rfm  that is , our groups a and b  can be fitted with an index of 2/3 , which they associated with curvature radiation .",
    "of course , our fitting does not _ determine _ this index , as it is highly correlated with the other two parameters ; however , it is significant , we believe , that an index of 2/3 can be imposed on both the group a and b stars without any serious degradation of @xmath84 .",
    "if the index @xmath104 in the modified thorsett relation can be interpreted straightforwardly in r&s terms , then this dependence represents an underlying physical situation in which particles of a particular @xmath131 radiate at different heights because the field - line curvature @xmath132 and the plasma frequency @xmath133 in turn vary systematically with height .",
    "thus , if the magnetic field is dipolar in the emission region , perhaps r&s s eq.(64 ) can meaningfully be evaluated to obtain the controlling quantity @xmath134 .",
    "other theories , however , may view this circumstance very differently , but must find a natural explanation for this specific rfm phenomenon .    a nearly opposite circumstance is observed in stars with no rfm .",
    "how can broad - band emission at a single , fixed height be understood ? a situation which r&s have not at all addressed .",
    "apparently , this inner - cone `` no - rfm '' situation is as general as the outer - cone rfm , and indeed both situations commonly appear in those stars with both inner- and outer - cone emission .",
    "this dichotomy is suggestive of the wave - mode propagation model first advanced in comprehensive detail by barnard & arons ( 1986 ) .",
    "though not free of problems , this model addresses the effects of birefringence in the pulsar magnetosphere , such that one propagating wave - mode escapes the magnetosphere at different heights mimicking the usual ( outer cone ) rfm behavior , whereas the other mode can probably escape from a fixed height with results similar to the `` no - rfm '' ( inner cone ) phenomenon .",
    "this said , it is not clear that inner and outer cones exhibit the systematic polarization differences which might be expected of distinct propagating wave modes  and , birefringence could also be involved in the angular shifts seen between the two polarization modes ( rankin & ramachandran 2002 ) .",
    "so , while we can not be sure that propagation effects are responsible for these dramatic differences , we are sympathetic to the possibility , and it remains possible that a more flexible propagation model such as petrova s ( 2001 and the references cited therein ) could account for the systematics of both beaming and polarization .",
    "so , in conclusion , our results seem nominally compatible with the picture that conal beams are produced by a system of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis some halfway out on the polar cap , which in turn are produced , perhaps , by excitation in `` vaccum gaps '' and radiate by a mechanism wherein the plasma frequency determines the emission height .",
    "nothing , however , in our analysis , has demonstrated these specific physical circumstances .",
    "we thank steve thorsett for generously sharing his notes and the profile measurements used in the preparation of his earlier paper .",
    "we also thank michael kramer both for his insightful comments on our manuscript as well as for the use of his gaussian - fitting programs , and yashwant gupta for providing several needed profiles using the gmrt .",
    "several profiles were obtained from the extremely useful pulsar database of the european pulsar network maintained by max - planck institut fr radioastronimie .",
    "we also learned much from discussions and comments on early versions of the manuscript from jim cordes , jan gil , aris karastergiou , george melikidze , r. ramachandran , mal ruderman , c. s. shukre , axel jessner and steve thorsett .",
    "portions of this work were carried out under us national science foundation ( nsf ) grants int 93 - 21974 and ast 99 - 87654 as well as under a visitor grant from the nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek .",

    "<S> in this paper we return to the old problem of conal component - pair widths and profile dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> observationally , we consider a set of 10 pulsars with prominent conal component pairs , for which well measured profiles exist over the largest frequency range now possible . apart from some tendency to narrow at high frequency , the conal components exhibit almost constant widths . </S>",
    "<S> we use all three profile measures , the component separation as well as the outside half - power and 10% widths , to determine conal beam radii , which are the focus of our subsequent analysis . </S>",
    "<S> these radii at different frequencies are well fitted by a relationship introduced by thorsett ( 1991 ) , but the resulting parameters are highly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> three different types of behavior are found : one group of stars exhibits a continuous variation of beam radius which can be extrapolated down to the stellar surface along the `` last open field lines '' ; a second group exhibits beam radii which asymptotically approach a minimum high frequency value that is 35 times larger ; and a third set shows almost no spectral change in beam radius at all . </S>",
    "<S> the first two behaviors are associated with outer - cone component pairs ; whereas the constant separation appears to reflect inner - cone emission . </S>",
    "<S> the first group , remarkably , can be fitted by a thorsett relation in which the constant term is constrained to be the field - tangent direction at the edge of the polar cap @xmath0 , but the others can not . </S>",
    "<S> the first group can also be fitted well using an index of 1/3 , but the second group can not .    </S>",
    "<S> we first compute heights from the conal beam radii , assuming dipolar fields and emission along the `` last open field lines''which we find are again well fitted by a suitable thorsett relation . here </S>",
    "<S> we find that the first group can be fitted using a constant term @xmath1 of 10 km and also that the first two groups are remarkably well fitted by an index of 2/3 . </S>",
    "<S> we then argue that physical emission heights can be estimated using the component separation along an interior annulus of field lines having their `` feet '' about halfway out on the polar cap  and such values agree well with most existing height values based on physical criteria .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we find that `` radius - to - frequency '' mapping is associated with outer - conal component pairs </S>",
    "<S> . the near constant behavior of inner - cones is thus arresting . </S>",
    "<S> we explore possible interrelationships between the spectral behavior of the component and profile widths produced both by the field - line flaring and the changing sightline geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we also attempt to understand the physical implications of the parameter values resulting from the thorsett - relation fits . </S>"
