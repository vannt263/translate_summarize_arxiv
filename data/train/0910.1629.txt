    "with the availability of a relatively large sample of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , we came to recognize that they comprise of two large classes @xcite : the so - called short - hard grbs ( duration @xmath0  s ) and the long - soft ones ( @xmath1  s ) .",
    "there is now increasing consensus that the observed dichotomy among long / short grbs may indicate diverse initial physical conditions and progenitors .",
    "long grbs are associated with the demise of massive stars @xcite . instead",
    ", short grbs often occur in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "this supports their interpretation in terms of compact object mergers .",
    "crucial information on grbs is revealed by their afterglows , which can be monitored by _ swift _",
    "@xcite in the optical and the x - ray range as soon as @xmath2  s after the burst . in this paper , we present the study of the short grb090510 with _ swift _ and _ fermi _ in a broad energy range , which extends from the optical up to a few gev .",
    "we report our observations and analysis in  2 ; in  3 we propose two different interpretations , in  4 we draw our conclusions .",
    "hereafter , we use the conventions @xmath3 for cgs units and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is energy flux , @xmath6 is the time from the trigger of @xmath7 burst alert telescope @xcite and @xmath8 the frequency .",
    "errors are reported at @xmath9 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "we assume a cosmology in which @xmath10 km s@xmath11",
    "mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . all the fluxes , times and frequencies are measured in the observer s frame .",
    "at 00:23:00 ut , may 10th , 2009 , bat , which operates in the 15 - 350 kev range , triggered on grb090510 @xcite . _",
    "swift _ slewed immediately to the burst .",
    "the duration was @xmath14  s. detailed analysis of the bat data is shown in ukwatta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .      the _ swift _ x - ray telescope @xcite began to observe the x - ray afterglow of grb090510 at t+98  s. the lightcurve ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows an initial slow flux decline .",
    "observations were interrupted when the source entered the earth constraint at t+1.9  ks .",
    "when they resumed , at t+5.1  ks , the flux was much lower .",
    "a broken powerlaw fit of the lightcurve gives as best fit parameters an early decay slope @xmath15 , break time @xmath16  ks , late decay slope @xmath17 ; @xmath18 with 77 degrees of fredom ( d.o.f . ) , which is still marginally acceptable ( chance probability @xmath19 ) .",
    "the _ swift _ ultra violet and optical telescope @xcite began settled exposures at t+97  s. the lightcurve of the optical afterglow , produced by renormalizing all individual filters to white , as described in oates et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the optical emission rises until @xmath20  ks , then decays .",
    "the optical lightcurve is well fitted ( @xmath21 = 23.9 with 19 d.o.f . ) by a broken powerlaw @xcite with a smooth break .",
    "the best fit parameters are : @xmath22 ; @xmath23  ks ; @xmath24 . adding a constant does not improve the fit significantly , suggesting a small host galaxy contribution .",
    "very large telescope observations @xcite provide a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath25 . using this redshift and the _ fermi _ spectral parameters , the isotropic equivalent energy of grb090510 is @xmath26 ergs in the 10 kev - 30 gev rest frame @xcite .",
    "grb090510 triggered both instruments onboard the _ fermi _ observatory @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ; 8 kev - 40 mev ) observed the burst during the prompt emision phase , and after an autonomous repointing , the large area telescope ( lat ; 20 mev - more than 300  gev ) began observations and detected a long - lasting ( up to 200s ) high - energy ( up to 4  gev ) emission .",
    "the analysis and interpretation of the prompt emission is presented in abdo et al .",
    "follow up observations lasted until 1500  s when the source was occulted by the earth , and resumed @xmath27 3.5  ks later .",
    "the observation epochs are defined in table  [ tab : lat_ext_tab ] . a time - resolved spectral analysis using diffuse events @xcite",
    "was performed ( table  [ tab : lat_ext_tab ] ) .",
    "the spectrum shows no significant evolution , and it is well - fitted by a powerlaw with energy index * @xmath28*. the lightcurve shows no significant feature and is best fitted by a powerlaw .",
    "the onset of the gbm emission ( t+0.013  s ) is a sensible reference for this temporal fit and yields a decay index @xmath29 ( @xmath21/dof = 9.4/7 ) ( fig .  1 ) . for the binned spectral analysis described in  3.2 , transient events from an energy - dependent region of interest",
    "were used , and front and back events were treated separately @xcite .",
    "grb090510 was a short burst with a relatively bright afterglow , and @xmath30 is among the highest for this class @xcite .",
    "the early rise of the optical flux is so far unique in short grbs .",
    "more importantly , grb090510 shows high energy emission up to the gev range , until t+200  s.    energetic short grbs with optical transients , such as grb050724 @xcite , typically have extended emission ( ee ) detected by bat and xrt , following the hard emission spike @xcite .",
    "if grb090510 had occurred at @xmath31 , as grb050724 , it would have produced a flux in the bat range of a few @xmath32 ergs @xmath33 s@xmath11 until @xmath2  s , and we would have classified it as an ee - grb .",
    "the nature of this high energy emission is nevertheless not easy to understand .",
    "ee often fades slowly for a few hundreds of seconds , then vanishes with a slope which can be as fast as @xmath34 ; after this sudden drop a late afterglow with a typical decay slope @xmath35 is sometimes observed ( e.g. grb050724 ; grb080123 , mangano et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "the fast decay and the extrapolation of the late afterglow back to early epochs suggest that ee is not the onset of the late afterglow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a few cases where the ee is bright enough to be studied in detail @xcite , it is found to have variations too rapid to be explained with external shock models @xcite .",
    "ee might instead indicate a declining activity of the grb central engine @xcite ; once this activity ends , then falls abruptly , and the forward shock ( fs ) emission prevails .",
    "in other cases , however , the flux decay from the beginning of _ swift _ observations seems due to the usual fs mechanism , such as in grb051221 @xcite and grb 061201 @xcite .",
    "we propose and discuss separately 2 scenarios to explain the emission after the initial spike : in the first one , the emission is due to both external fs and internal shock , @xcite while in the second the emission is due to fs alone .      in the first scenario",
    "we assume that the initial x - ray ( until the break at @xmath36  ks ) and @xmath37-ray flux are is emission , while the fs is responsible for the optical lightcurve and the late x - ray flux .",
    "in particular , the optical rise may be due to the onset of fs emission , detected @xmath38  s after the trigger in long grbs @xcite .",
    "this model can explain the different behavior of the early x - ray / lat and optical lightcurves .",
    "we constrain some physical properties of the fs blastwave .",
    "the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta is @xmath39 @xcite , where @xmath40 is the isotropic kinetic energy , @xmath41 the environment density in @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the peak time .",
    "the maximum fs flux is at the synchrotron characteristic frequency @xmath44 , and it is @xmath45jy @xcite , where @xmath46 is the fraction of internal energy in the magnetic field",
    ".    these parameter values must be consistent with @xmath47 @xcite and with the uvot data , which give a 3@xmath48 lower limit on @xmath49  s and a peak flux @xmath50jy .",
    "the first constraint can be written @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath44 is just below the optical band , the constraint on the flux becomes @xmath52 .",
    "assuming @xmath53 , the model is consistent with observations for @xmath54 , while @xmath55 .",
    "the xrt and lat fluxes can be explained by is synchrotron emission with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the synchrotron cooling frequency and @xmath58 is the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron luminosity , estimated from the 100s spectral energy distribution ( sed , fig .",
    "2 ) , is @xmath59 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "we find that for this value of @xmath60 and for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65  s , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the index of the powerlaw electron energy distribution , the fraction of energy given to electrons , the bulk lorentz factor and the variability timescale respectively , we have @xmath70  kev , f(1.7  kev ) @xmath71jy , which is within a factor @xmath72 from the observations , and f(100 mev ) @xmath73jy , which is consistent within @xmath74 of the data .",
    "the cut - off energy for pair production is @xmath75  gev , thus allowing the late emission of @xmath76  gev photons .",
    "is does not produce detectable emission in the optical , since this is below @xmath77  kev .",
    "compared with the scenario presented in  3.2 , this model has the advantage of not requiring extreme values of @xmath78 to explain an early ( few seconds ) fs emission onset in a low density environment expected for a short burst .",
    "however , it needs some fine tuning of parameters .",
    "the optical rise slope @xmath79 is shallower than that expected at the fs onset ( @xmath80 ) , although similar slow rises have been observed @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the onset of our observations caught the end of this steep rise phase , when the afterglow was turning over to a decay .",
    "another possible problem is that the required density appears very low .",
    "we note that the observed slope would be expected if @xmath44 were crossing the optical band and , in general , broad fs onset rises are also expected for outflows observed off - axis @xcite . however , a bright and hard event such as grb090510 is difficult to reconcile with the latter scenario , which predicts soft and dim prompt emission @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is that the afterglow of grb090510 , including the emission detected by lat , is entirely produced by the fs propagating in a constant density medium @xcite . according to the model ,",
    "the broad afterglow spectrum consists of three segments : a low - energy tail , of spectral slope @xmath81 ; another segment , for @xmath82 , where @xmath83 ; blueward of @xmath57 , the third segment has @xmath84 . for comparison with this spectral template , we built up 5 seds , at 100  s , 150  s , 1  ks , 7  ks , and 12  ks ( fig .",
    "3 ) , all including uvot and xrt data , and lat data were also included in the first sed .",
    "lat data were accumulated between 10  s and 200  s ( i.e. well after the end of the prompt emission seen in the gbm ) , and renormalized to 100  s using the decay index of @xmath85 .",
    "we fitted the seds simultaneously with a double broken powerlaw model , forcing @xmath81 and @xmath86 .",
    "we allowed the breaks to vary and galactic and host extinction were accounted for .",
    "the result is acceptable ( @xmath21/d.o.f.=110.3/83 ) and is shown in fig .  3 and table  [ tab : seds_fit ] .",
    "the fs alone could successfully describe the spectrum over 9 decades of frequency .",
    "a break between x - ray and @xmath37-ray ranges is fitted , at @xmath87  mev , but not constrained .",
    "it is studied more precisely by fitting the 100  s sed alone , freezing @xmath88 and @xmath89 at the 5 seds fit results and leaving @xmath90 and @xmath91 free to vary ( see table  [ tab : seds_fit ] ) .",
    "this fit fulfills the relation @xmath92 ( at 1.3 @xmath48 ) and a significant break is found ( 3.6 @xmath48 ) , although it yields a slightly harder @xmath90 ( 1.8 @xmath48 ) than the 5 sed fit shown in fig .",
    "the lat emission shows no spectral evolution , even at early times .",
    "therefore , to better characterize the high - energy spectrum , the sed at 100  s was rebuilt including lat data between 0.38  s and 200  s ( see table  [ tab : seds_fit ] and fig .  2 ) .",
    "a significant break ( @xmath93 including systematics ) between 10 and 133  mev was found .",
    "however , including this selection of lat data in the 5 sed fit yields a worse fit ( @xmath21/dof = 125.3/83 ) than that shown in fig .  3 .    in this fs interpretation ,",
    "the initial increase of the optical emission is due to @xmath44 approaching the optical band .",
    "the x - ray is already decaying because it lies above @xmath44 . in order to verify whether the required physical parameters are plausible , we impose the following constraints : i ) @xmath94jy at @xmath95hz and ii ) @xmath96hz . adopting the expressions for @xmath97 , @xmath44 , and @xmath57 from granot & sari ( 2002 ) ,",
    "the constraints above lead to the following equations : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we verified that the synchrotron self - compton cooling is not significant for @xmath102ks and @xmath103hz for a reasonable range of parameters @xcite .",
    "a very low , but not implausible , density is suggested .",
    "the flux at 100mev is @xmath104 this is consistent with the lat data at 100s , provided @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . for these parameters ,",
    "@xmath109gev at @xmath110  s , so that the flux in the lat energy range is approximated to be @xmath111 at @xmath110  s , consistent with the lat light curve .",
    "we note that @xmath112 is required for the fs onset time to be @xmath113  s.    in summary , the spectral properties of grb 090510 could be explained by a simple fs model .",
    "we note , though , that this simple model is hard to reconcile with some of the observed temporal properties .",
    "firstly , it predicts an x - ray decay index before the break of @xmath114 , clearly inconsistent with the observed @xmath115 .",
    "secondly , if the x - ray break at @xmath116ks is attributed to a jet break @xcite and , after this time , optical and x - ray lie on the same spectral segment , then the asymptotic optical decay index should be the same as @xmath117 .",
    "however , a fit of the whole lightcurve with a smooth broken power - law (  2.3 ) , adding a constant ( as a host galaxy contribution ) , gives an asymptotic decay slope @xmath118 , incompatible with the x - ray decay . finally ,",
    "although the error bars are quite large , we notice that , taken at face value , the slope of the uvot spectrum in the @xmath119ks sed is negative ( fig .",
    "3 ) , suggesting that @xmath44 may be already below the optical at that epoch .",
    "the above mentioned flaws imply that the simple fs model is not viable to explain the properties of grb090510 . however , this model relies on highly idealized assumptions , and it is known that several grb afterglows do not strictly follow its simple predictions .",
    "plausible effects that may affect the predictions and ease the comparison with gbr090510 are :    - a phase of energy injection @xcite , or an evolution of the microphysical parameters of the blast wave @xcite ; both may cause an early shallow decay of the x - ray flux ;    - the transit of @xmath44 slightly after the jet break , which could explain a shallow late optical decay .    with the present data , we are unable to distinguish between energy injection and microphysical parameter evolution . as for the x - ray decay post jet break ,",
    "hydrodynamical simulations show that initially the jet decay slope can reach @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "both the processes of energy injection and parameter evolution are capable of keeping the decay shallower , so that a late x - ray decay slope of @xmath121 could be achieved .",
    "therefore , with some extensions , the fs model could arrange the temporal properties , although some fine tunings would be needed .",
    "we have reported the _ swift _ and _ fermi _ observations of the short grb090510 , an event endowed with bright prompt and afterglow emission , and detected in the gev range up to 200  s after the trigger .",
    "the initial x - ray emission shows a slow decay up to @xmath122  ks , after which it quickly drops .",
    "the optical flux peaks at @xmath123  ks . we have explored two scenarios to explain the observed behaviors . + in the first scenario ,",
    "the early flux detected by xrt and lat is due to is , while the optical rise is the onset of fs emission or the transit of @xmath44 .",
    "this interpretation does not require extremely high values of lorentz factor , should the density of the environment be very low .",
    "we also find that reasonable values for the physical parameters can lead to the observed properties , which might favour the model , although some fine tuning is necessary .",
    "the second scenario assumes that the fs produces the full spectrum of the emission , observed from the optical to the gev band .",
    "the @xmath37-ray , x - ray and optical spectrum can be reproduced by the template fs spectral model and the required physical parameters are plausible . although the simple fs model fails to reproduce the observed temporal behavior , extensions of this model could accommodate the temporal mismatch . in order to identify the origin of the gev component of grbs like 090510 , more case studies",
    "will be necessary .",
    "fortunately , we have very promising prospects for other simultaneous _ fermi _ and _ swift _ observations of short grbs , which will provide us with more measurements to shed light on the properties of this class of events .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy and cnes in france for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged .",
