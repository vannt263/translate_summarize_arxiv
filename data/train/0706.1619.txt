    "since the seminal paper of wigner @xcite , much attention has been devoted to the question of uniqueness of commutation relations and/or of associative products compatible with the dynamics of a given quantum system ( the harmonic oscillator in the cited wigner s paper ) .",
    "it is well known that alternative and compatible poisson brackets appear in connection with the problem of complete integrability within a classical framework @xcite .",
    "the problem of which alternative quantum structures , after taking the appropriate classical limit , could reproduce the alternative known hamiltonian descriptions has also been considered in many papers ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to discuss how one can obtain some novel alternative descriptions , both in the classical and in the quantum context , by deforming `` the _ linear structure _ instead of the ( associative or lie ) product .",
    "more explicitly , we will see under what circumstances ( for instance the existence of a regular lagrangian description @xmath3 on the tangent bundle @xmath0 of some configuration space @xmath1 ) one can construct a linear structure on @xmath0 that can be considered as adapted '' to the given dynamical system .",
    "if and when this is possible , one obtains a new action of the group @xmath4 @xmath5 on @xmath0 and , as will be shown , the lagrangian two - form @xmath6 can be put explicitly in canonical darboux form .",
    "one can then follow the weyl procedure @xcite to quantize the dynamics , by realizing the associated weyl system on the hilbert space of square - integrable functions on a suitable lagrangian submanifold of @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that many dynamical systems admit genuinely alternative descriptions @xcite poses an interesting question , namely : assume that a given dynamical system admits alternative descriptions with more than one linear structure . according to what has been outlined above",
    ", one will possibly obtain different actions ( realizations ) of the group @xmath4 on @xmath0 that in general will not be linearly related .",
    "then , it will be possible to quantize  la `` weyl the system in two different ways , thereby obtaining different hilbert space structures on spaces of square - integrable functions on different lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "( actually what appears as a lagrangian submanifold in one scheme need not be such in the other .",
    "moreover , the lebesgue measures will be different in the two cases ) .",
    "the occurrence of this situation seems then to offer the possibility of , so - to - speak,''evading \" the von neumann theorem @xcite and this is one of the topics to be discussed in this note .    as a simple example ,",
    "consider three lorentz frames , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , moving relative to each other with constant relative velocities all along the same direction ( along the @xmath9-axis , say ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be the velocity of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath13 the velocity of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath11 , all in units of the speed of light . ] .",
    "then @xmath8 will have , in the same units , a relative velocity:@xmath14 with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "the velocity @xmath15 in @xmath12 of a point - particle moving with respect to @xmath8 with a velocity ( again along the @xmath9-axis ) @xmath16 can be computed in two different ways , namely :    1 .",
    "first we compute the velocity of the point - particle with respect to @xmath11 as : @xmath17 and then the final velocity as:@xmath18 in this way we have first `` composed '' @xmath13 and @xmath16 according to the law ( [ comp0 ] ) and then the result has been `` composed '' with @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively we can : 2 .   first evaluate @xmath19 , according to eq.([comp0 ] ) , i.e. first  `` composing '' @xmath10 and @xmath13 , and then the result with @xmath16 , obtaining:@xmath20    it is obvious that ( [ comp1 ] ) and ( [ comp2 ] ) yield the same result , namely:@xmath21    all this is elementary , but shows that already the familiar ( one - dimensional ) relativistic law of addition of the velocities provides us with a composition law for points in the open interval @xmath22 that has the same associative property as the standard law of addition of ( real or complex ) numbers .",
    "this example , whose discussion will be completed in appendix @xmath23 , serves as a partial motivation for the study of linear structures non linearly related to other similar structures . in the next section",
    "we will give some more complete definitions and examples , before proceeding to the main subject of the present note .",
    "it is well known that all finite dimensional linear spaces are linearly isomorphic .",
    "the same is true for infinite dimensional hilbert spaces ( even more , the isormorphism can be chosen to be an isometry ) .",
    "however , alternative ( i.e. not linearly related ) linear structures can be constructed easily on a given set .",
    "for instance consider a linear space @xmath24 with addition @xmath25 and multiplication by scalars @xmath26 , and a nonlinear diffeomorphism @xmath27 .",
    "now we can define a new addition @xmath28 and a new multiplication by scalar @xmath29 by setting : @xmath30 and @xmath31 these operations have all the usual properties of addition and multiplication by a scalar .",
    "in particular : @xmath32 and @xmath33 indeed , e.g.:@xmath34 which proves ( [ property3 ] ) , and similarly for ( [ property4 ] ) .",
    "obviously , the two linear spaces @xmath35 and @xmath36 are finite dimensional vector spaces of the same dimension and hence are isomorphic .",
    "however , the change of coordinates defined by @xmath37 that we are using to  deform \" the linear structure is a nonlinear diffeomorphism . in other words",
    ", we are using two different ( diffeomorphic but not linearly related ) global charts to describe the same manifold space @xmath24 .    as a simple ( but significant ) example of this idea consider the linear space @xmath38 .",
    "this can also be viewed as a hilbert space of complex dimension 1 that can be identified with @xmath39 .",
    "we shall denote its coordinates as @xmath40 and we choose the nonlinear transformation @xcite : @xmath41with @xmath42 , which can be inverted as @xmath43where @xmath44 , and the positive function @xmath45 is given by the relation @xmath46 and satisfies the equation:@xmath47 ( hence , actually , @xmath48 as well as : @xmath49 ) . using this transformation",
    "we construct an alternative linear structure on @xmath39 by using formulas ( property1 ) and ( [ property2 ] ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath50 and @xmath51 the new addition and multiplication by scalars . then , with : @xmath52@xmath53one finds:@xmath54i.e.:@xmath55where:@xmath56    quite similarly:@xmath57where:@xmath58    the two different realizations of the translation group in @xmath38 are associated with the vector fields @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "the two are connected by : @xmath61where @xmath23 is the jacobian matrix : @xmath62 in the sequel we will write simply @xmath23 as : @xmath63with an obvious identification of the entries . then , also:@xmath64the integral curves in the plane @xmath40 of the vector fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 are shown in figure 1 . they should be compared with the straight lines associated with @xmath67 and @xmath68     of the vector fields @xmath69 . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]   of the vector fields @xmath69 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]    thus the @xmath70 translation group @xmath38 is realized in two different ways .",
    "one interesting consequence of this is that one obtains two different ways of defining the fourier transform .",
    "also , when considering square - integrable functions in @xmath71 , functions that are square - integrable with respect to the unique lebesgue measure which is invariant with respect to translation defining one linear structure need not be so with respect to the lebesgue measure defined by the other linear structure .",
    "this will become important when considering the quantum case and we will come back to this point later on .",
    "the above scheme can be generalized to the case of a diffeomorphism:@xmath72between a vector space @xmath24  and a manifold @xmath73  possessing  `` a priori '' no linear structures whatsoever .",
    "this will require , of course , that @xmath73 be such that it can be equipped with a one - chart atlas .",
    "then it is immediate to see that eqns .",
    "( [ property1 ] ) and ( [ property2 ] ) ( with @xmath74 , now ) apply to this slightly more general case as well . some specific examples ( with , e.g. , @xmath73 an open interval of a punctured sphere )",
    "will be discussed in appendix @xmath23 while , in appendix @xmath75 , we will discuss briefly how a superposition rule ( not a linear one , though ) can also be defined in the case , which is relevant for quantum mechanics , of the space of pure states of a quantum system , i.e. on the projective hilbert space @xmath76 of a ( complex linear ) hilbert space @xmath77      to every linear structure there is associated in a canonical way a _ dilation _ ( or liouville ) field @xmath78 which is the infinitesimal generator of dilations ( and in fact it can be shown that uniquely characterizes it , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the new linear structure , it makes sense to consider the mapping @xmath79 via:@xmath80 where again , we are considering a transformation @xmath81 .",
    "the transformed flow takes the explicit form @xmath82 property  ( [ property3 ] ) ensures that @xmath83 i.e. that ( [ dilation ] ) is indeed a one - parameter group .",
    "then , the infinitesimal generator of the group is defined as:@xmath84_{t=0}=\\left [ \\frac{d}{dt}\\phi\\left ( e^{t}\\phi^{-1}(u)\\right ) \\right]_{t=0},\\ ] ] or , explicitly , in components:@xmath85 _",

    "let us go back to the example in @xmath38 considered in the previous section .",
    "first , notice that we have the identification @xmath94 so that the dilation ( liouville ) field @xmath95is such that : @xmath96where @xmath97 is the standard symplectic form .",
    "another relevant structure that can be constructed is the complex structure , that is defined by the @xmath98 tensor field : @xmath99which satisfies @xmath100 ( the identity ) and , being constant , has a vanishing nijenhuis tensor @xcite :  @xmath101 .",

    "it should be clear from , e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) that these three structures are not independent : given any two of them the third one is defined in terms of the previous ones @xcite .",
