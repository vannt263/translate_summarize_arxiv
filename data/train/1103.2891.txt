    "<S> we study two - flavor neutrino oscillations in a homogeneous and isotropic ensemble under the influence of neutrino - neutrino interactions . for any density there exist forms of collective oscillations that show self - maintained coherence . </S>",
    "<S> they can be classified by a number @xmath0 of linearly independent functions that describe all neutrino modes as linear superpositions . </S>",
    "<S> what is more , the dynamics is equivalent to another ensemble with the same effective density , consisting of @xmath0 modes with discrete energies @xmath1 with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we use this equivalence to derive the analytic solution for two - mode ( bimodal ) coherence , relevant for spectral - split formation in supernova neutrinos . </S>"
