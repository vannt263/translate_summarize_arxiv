    "one of the most fascinating aspects of the anderson localization - delocalization transition is the occurrence of multifractal fluctuations of the wavefunction intensity at the critical point.@xcite while , strictly speaking , the fluctuations are truly multifractal only at the critical point , where the correlation length @xmath5 diverges , multifractal fluctuations nevertheless persist on either side of the transition on length scales less than the correlation length.@xcite the persistence of the fluctuations can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - states ] , where the wavefunction intensities for some typical critical , metallic and localized wavefunctions are plotted . in this paper",
    "we show how to exploit this persistence by combining multifractal analysis with finite size scaling to arrive at a very powerful method for the quantitative analysis of the anderson transition , or any continuous phase transition that exhibits multifractal fluctuations : multifractal finite size scaling ( mfss ) .",
    "below we describe in detail the mfss procedure and we demonstrate its potential by employing it to make a more comprehensive analysis of the anderson transition in three dimensions than given in our letter.@xcite as we describe , the mfss procedure permits the simultaneous estimation of the usual critical parameters , such as the location of the critical point and the critical exponent , and the multifractal exponents .",
    "moreover , mfss offers the opportunity to examine the consistency of the estimates of the critical parameters against the choice of multifractal exponent used in the scaling analysis .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec - model ] , we describe briefly the anderson model of a disordered systems and the numerical simulation of the anderson transition . in section [ sec - gmfe ]",
    ", we define the generalized multifractal exponents ( gmfes ) used in mfss , and derive the corresponding scaling laws .",
    "the relation between the gmfes and the scaling properties of the probability density function ( pdf ) of wavefunction intensities is discussed in section [ sec - pdf ] . in section [ sec - datacor ]",
    "we demonstrate the necessity of avoiding correlations in the wavefunctions . in sections [ sec - fixlambda ] and [ sec-3dfss ] we present results from standard and multifractal fss , including estimates for the critical parameters and multifractal exponents . finally , details of how to account for the inevitable correlations in different coarse grainings of the same simulation data , as well as how to check the stability of the scaling fits , are collected in the appendices .",

    "@xmath75 implies a relation of the form @xmath85 this differs from the scaling law proposed in refs .",
    "@xmath86 moreover , this latter scaling law is in error because the renormalization of the lattice constant ( or box size ) has been neglected .",
    "in fact , for the 3d anderson model , the latter scaling law produces estimates for @xmath87 which violate the universality of the transition ( ref .  ) .",
    "the fits at fixed @xmath25 for @xmath50 , @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and for @xmath57 for @xmath90 do not fully satisfy our stability requirements , as one of the expansions in the stability test gives estimates slightly outside the corresponding confidence intervals .",
    "we suspect this is due to the numerical @xmath62-minimization not being able to resolve two neighboring minima .",
    "if we reduce the data set by restricting slightly the range of @xmath15 or the range of @xmath9 , we quickly find stability for the same expansion , giving very similar confidence intervals .",
    "therefore , we include the results for the fits using the whole data set ."
