    "the problem of transition between localized and extended states of many particle systems attracts attention of condensed matter theorists and experimentalists for a long time .",
    "the theory of non interacting electrons in the random external field in one and two dimensions predicts localization of particles for arbitrarily weak disorder @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "the state of non interacting electrons is localized for sufficiently strong disorder @xcite , @xcite , and the state is extended for the disorder less than a critical edge . for negative energy with absolute value much larger than the mobility edge , the system is strongly localized and its density of states is described by so called `` tail '' of density of states @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the common point of view is that the repulsive interaction between electrons suppresses localization .",
    "so far this problem was mainly considered in the case of week disorder @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however the problem of investigation of transition between localized and extended states caused by interaction between particles in three dimension is of great importance and interest , but it can not be solved in the framework of the weak disorder .",
    "the problem of localization in a random field was investigated for the case of the fermi statistics of particles . in this case",
    "if the fermi energy is large enough the interaction between particles can be neglected , as it was done in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the problem when both random field and the interaction between particles are involved , is the sufficiently more complicated .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of bose statistics of particles , although , the technique developed here , in general points , can be applied for the fermi case too . for bose system in random field",
    "the interaction between particles plays fundamental role and can not be neglected .",
    "this is because the nonzero energy of the bose system without random potential is defined by the interaction between particles , and exactly this interaction prevents the fall of the system to the very bottom of the fluctuating random potential wells .",
    "our goal is development of a technique for the description of the transition from the localized state to the delocalized superfluid state .",
    "the experimental and theoretical investigations of this transition in the systems of different nature are of an interest for a long time @xcite - @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the works @xcite - @xcite the bose gas in a small random external field",
    "was considered and corrections to the temperature of the superfluid transition and to the superfluid density were calculated using perturbation theory in random field . in the recent works @xcite ,",
