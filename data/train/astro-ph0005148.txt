    "the most sensitive rosat surveys consist of a 207 ksec rosat pspc exposure , a 205 ksec hri raster scan and a total 1112 ksec hri expsoure of a @xmath4 area in the lockman hole region .",
    "the hri images are the basis for the ultradeep hri survey ( hasinger at al . 1999 ) . at a flux limit of 10@xmath1  erg  s@xmath3 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev energy band ,",
    "the hri survey has resolved about 70 - 80% of the soft x - ray background into discrete sources .",
    "the rosat deep survey ( rds ) , based on the pspc image , includes a statistically complete sample of 50 x - ray sources with fluxes in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band greater than 5.5@xmath010@xmath1  erg  s@xmath3 ( hasinger et al .",
    "the spectroscopic identification of the rds using the keck and palomar telescopes have shown that about 75% of the sources are quasars and seyfert galaxies ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998 , lehmann et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "both surveys contain 91 x - ray sources , where the faintest sources reach a flux of 1.2@xmath010@xmath1 erg s@xmath3 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "recent optical / infrared work has led to an identification of 88 of the 91 x - ray sources , confirming a high fraction of agns ( 72 objects ) .",
    "this is the largest fraction of agns found in any previous x - ray survey ( boyle et al .",
    "1995 , georgantopolous et al .",
    "1996 , bower et a. 1996 and mchardy et al .",
    "1998 ) . among our agns is the most distant x - ray selected quasar at a redshift of 4.45 ( schneider et al . 1998 ) .",
    "groups and clusters of galaxies ( @xmath510% ) form the second most abundant class of objects .",
    "one x - ray source has been classified as a narrow emission line galaxy ( nelg ) , whereas some deep rosat pspc surveys found a significantly larger fraction of nelgs ( boyle et al .",
    "1995 , mchardy et al .",
    "we see no evidence that nelgs or other classes of objects dominate the soft x - ray counts at faint fluxes .",
    "in the following we discuss the emission line properties of the 41 spectroscopically confirmed rds quasars and seyfert galaxies .",
    "33 x - ray sources have been identified with quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies in the redshift range between 0.08 and 2.83 .",
    "their optical spectra show broad emission lines ( fwhm @xmath6 1500 km s@xmath3 ) of ly@xmath7 @xmath81216 , c iv @xmath81548 , c iii ] @xmath81908 and mg ii @xmath82798 at medium and large redshifts , or of balmer lines ( h@xmath7 @xmath86563 , h@xmath94861 ) at lower redshifts .",
    "most of them can be classified as type i agn , whereas the large balmer decrement of two seyfert galaxies having broad h@xmath7 or h@xmath9 emission lines indicates type ii agn ( see object 59a in fig .",
    "the optical spectra of six rds agns show only narrow emission lines with fwhm @xmath10 1500 km s@xmath3 indicating a type ii agn .",
    "when their redshifts are above 0.5 , the spectra do not allow a classification using the diagnostic diagrams of osterbrock ( 1981 ) .",
    "but the existence of high excitation [ ne  v ] @xmath83426 ( see 26a in fig .",
    "2 ) or strong [ ne iii ]  @xmath83868 narrow emission lines , together with an x - ray luminosity above 10@xmath11 erg s@xmath3 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band , reveal an agn ( schmidt et al . 1998 ) .",
    "two further sources have been classified as type ii agns , because of their high x - ray luminosity ( log l@xmath12 ) .",
    "one of them is a radio galaxy at @xmath13 showing only typical galaxy absorption lines .",
    "several rds agns ( type i and ii ) below @xmath14 show a significant continuum emission originating in the host galaxy ( fig",
    "the rds sample contains in total 35 type i and 6 type ii agns .",
    "the large @xmath15 colour of two spectroscopically unidentified sources indicates either obscured agns or high - redshift clusters of galaxies ( lehmann et al .",
    "in the course of the spectrocopic identification of our x - ray sources we have taken optical spectra of 83 field galaxies .",
    "67 of them are narrow emission line galaxies ( nelgs ) with no physical connection to the x - ray sources .",
    "there is no soft x  ray emission ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev band ) detected above a limiting flux of 10@xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 associated with these sources .",
    "the optical spectra of the field nelg ( cf .",
    "14c in fig .",

    "( 1998 ) and lehmann et al . ( 2000 ) .    to study the emission line properties we have derived the fwhm and the rest frame ew for the most prominent emission lines of the rds quasars / seyfert galaxies and of the field nelgs .",
    "the mean fwhm / ew values for the broad emission lines of rds quasars / seyfert 1 galaxies are consistent with those values found for other x - ray selected agn samples at lower mean redshift , eg . , the rixos - sample ( puchnarewicz et al . 1997 ) and the crss - sample ( boyle et al . 1997 ) , and the mean values derived from several emisssion line and uv / optical selected agn samples ( schmidt et al .",

    "the mean rds ew values of the forbidden narrow emission lines , found for seyfert galaxies at redshifts below 1 , are slightly smaller than those from the agn comparison samples ( lehmann et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the rds ew of [ ne  iii ] @xmath83868 and the [ o  iii ] @xmath174959/5007 lines seem to be in better agreement with those from field nelgs ( tab .",
    "1 ) than with those from other agn samples .",
    "the optical spectra of most rds agns , which contain forbidden narrow emission lines , show several typical galaxy absorption lines , eg .",
    ", ca h@xmath18k @xmath193934/3968 , ch  g @xmath84301 ( see 26a in fig .",
    "2 ) . a strong continuum contribution produced by the host galaxy could account for these less stronger forbidden lines in our rds agns .",
    "although the majority of our faint x - ray sources have been spectroscopically identified with quasars and seyfert galaxies , only one out of 69 agns matches the optical criteria of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies taken from osterbrock & pogge ( 1985 ) and more precisely defined by goodrich ( 1989 ) .",
    "these somewhat subjective criteria are as follows .",
    "1 ) nls1 have slightly broader balmer lines ( @xmath10 2000 km s@xmath3 ) in comparison to the forbidden lines such as [ o  ii ] @xmath83727 or [ o  iii ] @xmath174959/5007 .",
    "2 ) the flux ratio [ o  iii ] @xmath205007 to h@xmath9 @xmath84861 is @xmath10 3 , a level which allows to discriminate between nls1 and seyfert 2 galaxies ( shuder & osterbrock 1981 ) .",
    "3 ) emission lines of fe ii or of high ionization [ fe vii ] @xmath86087 and [ fe x ] @xmath86375 are often present .    the spectrum of the nls1 37a ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows prominent fe ii bumps at 45004600   and at 52505350   ( in the rest frame ) .",
    "the fwhm of the broad component of the h@xmath9 @xmath84861 emission line is slightly above the limit for nls1 ( 2070@xmath2120 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the flux ratio [ o  iii ] @xmath85007/h@xmath9 @xmath84861 is clearly below 3 .",
    "the nls1 37a at @xmath22 belongs to the highest - redshift objects of this class .",
    "the bright soft x  ray selected sample of grupe et al . ( 1999 ) contains for example only 4 objects ( 12% ) above @xmath23 .    the fraction of nls1 in x - ray selected agn samples ( see for an overview grupe in these proceedings ) has to be considered with caution .",
    "nls1 at redshifts above 0.65 could be missed due to the limited wavelength coverage of the optical spectra ( @xmath24 8200  ) .",
    "the h@xmath9/[o  iii ] region is covered in 13 of 69 spectroscopically identified agns from the rosat deep surveys .",
    "most of our agns show only broad uv emission lines , eg .",

    "recently , rodriguez - pascual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have detected broad components of strong uv emission lines ( eg . , l@xmath7 @xmath81216 and c  iv  @xmath81548 ) in several nls1 .",
    "if this is a common property we can not exclude a significantly larger fraction of nls1 in high - redshift agn samples .    but even the fraction of nls1 in some low - redshift agn samples , eg .",
    "7% of the rosat bright survey ( schwope et al .",
    "2000 ) or 22% of the rixos agn sample ( puchnarewicz et al . 1997 ) , could result from a different classification scheme of nls1 objects ( upper limit for fwhm@xmath25 or 2000 km s@xmath3 ) . without well - controlled samples at low and high redshifts",
    "it is not possible to obtain reliable statements about the cosmological evolution of nls1 .",
    "the fraction of nls1 found in the rosat deep surveys ( @xmath51% ) may indicate a marginal contribution of nls1 to the soft x - ray background .",
    "nevertheless we have to consider this as a lower limit so far ."
