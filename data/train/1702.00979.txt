    "the experimental and theoretical search for materials that are physical realizations of quantum spin models on low - dimensional lattices is a main focus of current condensed matter physics .",
    "depending on the lattice geometry , such model materials with spin-@xmath10 demonstrate numerous nontrivial magnetic phenomena , like bose - einstein condensation of the magnons  @xcite , plateaus of the magnetization  @xcite , the resonating valence bond ground state ( triangular lattice ) , skyrmions  @xcite and others .",
    "in the recent years , prototypical low - dimensional magnetic systems with spin larger than one - half have attracted attention as experimental and theoretical studies on systems with s@xmath111 open a way to probe the quantum states of model systems which differ from the extreme case of the spin-@xmath10 analogs .",

    "the integer and non - integer spin ladders exhibit strongly different properties : using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method it was shown that for semi - integer spin ladders the spin excitations are gapless for odd legs and gapped for even leg numbers . for integer spin ladders the spin gap is nonzero for both odd and even number of legs  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the even - leg spin-1 ladder has been found to host a symmetry - protected topological ground state  @xcite .",
    "the presence of anisotropy has been suggested to yield a nontrivial entanglement spectrum even in the unperturbed ground state  @xcite .",
    "recently , the phase diagram of spin-1 weakly coupled antiferromagnetic ( afm ) chains with single - ion anisotropy was obtained using the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath6 ladder structure with @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the magnetic exchange parameters along the legs and the rungs of the ladder , respectively ) also offers the possibility to investigate experimentally the crossover from coupled antiferromagnetic dimers to the 2-leg haldane - like ladder .",

    "in turn , the elements of the single - ion anisotropy tensor were obtained by using the spin - orbit coupling as a perturbation  @xcite . the procedure for calculating the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions",

    "[ orbit]b ) .",
    "@xmath142 is much smaller than @xmath141 since the lobes of the 3@xmath151-@xmath152-like orbitals on the two ni@xmath3-ions along the legs ( i.e. , in _",
    "a_-direction ) tilt in different directions .",
    "the @xmath115-orbital pointing towards the 3@xmath151-@xmath152-orbital on one particular ni@xmath3-ion will be directed almost perpendicular to the 3@xmath151-@xmath152-orbital of the neighboring ni@xmath3-ion in the leg .",
    "such geometry results in a rather weak 3@xmath151-@xmath152-o @xmath115 overlap leading to an exchange constant seven times smaller than @xmath141 . in comparison ,",
    "the inter - ladder interactions @xmath153 and @xmath154 are negligible since there are no nitrate groups between ni atoms in these directions and the ni - ni distances are large , i.e. , 7.3 and 6.8   , respectively .",
    "these tb - lmto - asa results concerning the isotropic exchange interactions are confirmed by the gga+u vasp calculations .",
    "we have evaluated the exchange integral along the rungs ( @xmath141 ) by the total energy difference of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations , @xmath155=@xmath156 .",

    "the value of the exchange interaction @xmath141=12.73 k agrees with the tb - lmto - asa results .",
    "the center of inversion in the _ pnma _ structure of rb@xmath0ni@xmath1(no@xmath0)@xmath2 is placed at the origin . since two ni atoms belonging to the rungs or the legs of the ladder do not transform into each other under inversion operation",
    ", one could expect a non - zero dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction for these two pathways .",
    "indeed we obtain @xmath157=(0.01 , 0 , 0.01 )  k and @xmath158=(-0.01 , 0.1 , 0.08 )  k. note , however , that our experimental data on the powder sample do not allow evidencing such a small effect of the dm exchange .",
    "since almost zero anisotropy was obtained within the perturbation theory in the framework of the lmto calculation we try to estimate its value using the vasp package .",
    "the single ion anisotropy could be evaluated as total energies difference of several magnetic configurations .",
    "lets us consider the spin on the first ni site .",
    "if the spin has an easy - axis with local @xmath159 axis the corresponding term in the hamiltonian ( [ heisenberg ] ) has the form @xmath160 . calculating the total energies of four spin states in which the spin on the first ni ion directs along @xmath159 , -@xmath159 , @xmath161 , -@xmath161 while the spins on other seven ni ions are along @xmath162 direction , one can evaluate the single ion anisotropy parameter as @xmath85=@xmath163  @xcite . in the case of rb@xmath0ni@xmath1(no@xmath0)@xmath2",
    "the direction of the easy - axis is unknown .",
    "hence we perform the total energy calculations for four different configurations : in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) the spin on the first ni site is set along the @xmath164 and @xmath165 directions , respectively , while all the rest spins are along @xmath166 ; in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) the spin on the first ni site is set along @xmath164 and @xmath166 directions , respectively , while all the other spins are directed along @xmath165 .",
    "the obtained total energies are @xmath167=-783.06992455 ev , @xmath168=-783.06970414 ev , @xmath169=-783.06990379 ev , @xmath170=-783.06987355 ev .",
    "one can conclude that the @xmath164 direction is preferable and a rough estimation of anisotropy could be obtained as @xmath167-@xmath168=-2.6  k. this value still underestimates the experimental result of a=-8.6  k. the estimation of the single ion anisotropy value from electronic structure calculations is burdened by the necessity to evaluate small differences of large total energies . since there are 132 atoms in the unit cell of rb@xmath0ni@xmath1(no@xmath0)@xmath2 it is hard to test the obtained results with respect to parameters responsible for the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "to compare theoretical results with experiment we employ the expression for the curie - weiss temperature @xmath36=@xmath171 obtained by using the high - temperature expansion of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "here , @xmath172 is the summarized exchange interaction of a given ni site with the magnetic environment , which is @xmath173 in case of rb@xmath0ni@xmath1(no@xmath0)@xmath2 .",
    "the value of the curie - weiss temperature recalculated from the numerically obtained exchange constants equals -9.6  k ( for @xmath130=6.5  ev ) which is in a good agreement with the experimental data of @xmath174  k.    to reproduce the experimentally measured magnetic susceptibility we have solved the heisenberg model for the @xmath6 two - leg ladder by using the quantum monte carlo loop algorithm  @xcite implemented in the alps simulation package  @xcite .",
    "the obtained susceptibility for two sets of exchange parameters @xmath141=9.8  k , @xmath142=1.62  k and @xmath141=10.5  k , @xmath142=1.62  k is presented in fig .",
    "[ chi_model ] ( solid curves ) .",
    "since the esr data are described reasonably well within the dimer model we also calculate the susceptibility of independent dimers with the intradimer exchange interactions @xmath89=9.8  k and @xmath89=10.5  k by means of full diagonalization ( dotted curves ) . the best agreement with the experimental data",
    "is achieved for the ladder model with @xmath141=10.5  k and @xmath142=1.62  k.",
    "in this paper we report the synthesis , crystal structure and thermodynamic properties of the new rb@xmath0ni@xmath1(no@xmath0)@xmath2 compound .",
    "the magnetic excitations have been examined in high field high frequency esr .",
    "the measurements of magnetization , specific heat and high - field electron spin resonance have revealed a spin - liquid behavior . from analysis of experimental magnetic susceptibility data and electronic structure calculations the main exchange interaction along the rung of the ladder",
    "is estimated to be 9.8 - 11  k , while the interaction along the leg is about seven times smaller .",
    "hence , we can identify these compound as the physical realization of the strong - rung spin-1 ladder model .",
    "even the simple model of the free dimers describes some of the experimental observations , such as the main features of the hf - esr and the magnetization at low temperature .",
    "however , the susceptibility data is better reproduced within ladder model .",
    "hence we suggest that probably a more sophisticated model is needed to obtain the complete agreement of theory and experiment",
