    "lattice qcd plays an important role in understanding the n * spectrum .",
    "one can systematically study the spectrum sector by sector , with the ability to dial the quark masses , and dissect the degrees of freedom .",
    "the rich structure of the excited baryon spectrum , as tabulated by the particle data group  @xcite , provides a fertile ground for exploring how the internal degrees of freedom in the nucleon are excited and how qcd works in a wider context .",
    "one outstanding example is the parity splitting pattern in the low - lying n * spectrum .",
    "the splittings are a direct manifestation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd . without it , qcd predicts parity doubling in the baryon spectrum .",
    "the experimental effort on excited baryons has intensified in recent years at jlab and other accelerators , generating renewed debate on how well these states are known .",
    "the star - rating system on the observed states is a reflection of the current situation .",
    "given that state - of - the - art lattice qcd simulations have produced a ground - state spectrum that is very close to the observed values  @xcite , it is important to extend the success beyond the ground states .",
    "there exist already a number of lattice studies of the n * spectrum  @xcite , focusing mostly on the spin-1/2 sector .",
    "all established a clear splitting from the ground state . in this study , we explore the possibility of calculating the excited baryon states in the spin-3/2 sector with isospin 1/2 .",
    "we consider the following interpolating field with the quantum numbers @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath1 despite having an explicit parity by construction , the interpolating field couples to both positive and negative parity states . a parity projection is needed to separate the two . in the large euclidean time limit , the correlator with dirichlet boundary condition in the time direction and zero spatial momentum becomes @xmath2 @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a function common to both terms .",
    "the relative sign in front of @xmath5 provides the solution : by taking the trace of @xmath6 with @xmath7 , one can isolate @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that a spin-3/2 interpolating field couples to both spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 states . a spin projection can be used to isolate the individual contributions in the correlation function @xmath10 . using the spin-3/2 projection operator  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath11 the spin-3/2 part can be projected out by @xmath12 while the spin-1/2 part by @xmath13 obviously , they satisfy the relation @xmath14    the anisotropic gauge action of  @xcite , and the anisotropic d234 quark action of  @xcite are used .",
    "both have tadpole - improved tree - level coefficients",
    ". a @xmath15 lattice with @xmath16 fm and anisotropy @xmath17 is used . in all , 100 configurations are analyzed .",
    "on each configuration 9 quark propagators are computed using a multi - mass solver , with quark masses ranging from approximately 780 to 90 mev .",
    "the corresponding mass ratio @xmath18 is from 0.95 to 0.65 .",
    "a gauge - invariant gaussian - smeared source is used .",
    "the source is located at @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ corr_n3tr_pos ] presents results for the correlation function in the positive - parity nucleon channel at the smallest quark mass considered .",
    "spin projection reveals two different exponentials from the spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 parts , with the spin-3/2 state being heavier than the spin-1/2 one ( a steeper fall - off ) , in agreement with the ordering in experiment . the expected relation in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) is indeed satisfied numerically , providing a non - trivial check of the calculation .",
    "a further check of the calculation is provided by the fact that the mass extracted from @xmath20 is degenerate with that from the conventional @xmath21 for the nucleon ground state using the interpolating field @xmath22 .",
    "one would get a false signal from the dominant spin-1/2 state without spin projection .",
    "the large error bars indicate sensitive cancellations in the projection procedure .",
    "figure  [ corr_n3tr_neg ] shows the similar plot in the negative - parity nucleon channel . here the relation in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) is also satisfied , even though the signal is dominated by the @xmath23 state .",
    "the results also show a similar mass for the @xmath24 state and the @xmath23 state , in accord with the experimental states of @xmath25 and @xmath26 which are close to each other .",
    "figure  [ ratio3_pos ] presents results for the mass ratio extracted from the correlation functions for the @xmath27 state to the nucleon ground state as a function of the mass ratio @xmath28 .",
    "mass ratios have minimal dependence on the uncertainties in determining the scale and the quark masses , so that a more reliable comparison with experiment can be made .",
    "figure  [ ratio3_neg ] shows the similar plot for the @xmath29 state .",
    "these ratios appear headed in the right direction compared to experiment .",
    "we have obtained clear signals for spin-3/2 n * states on an anisotropic lattice with smeared operators and 100 configurations . states of both negative- and positive - parity are isolated with a parity projection technique . the need for spin projection",
    "is further demonstrated .",
    "the results for the pattern of the splittings appears consistent with experiment , but more study is needed to address systematic errors .",
    "this work is supported in part by u.s .",

    "the computing resources at nersc and jlab have been used ."
