    "ten - dimensional supergravity describes the low energy dynamics of string theory and has a rich mathematical structure .",
    "finding explicit solutions to the supergravity field equations is an important task to better understand the low energy dynamics of string theory and to develop new examples of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , which is often limited to cases with a large amount of symmetry .",
    "however , these equations are highly nonlinear and finding explicit solutions without a large amount of symmetry is not an easy task .",
    "one approach that has been quite successful in the past is to use known string theory duality transformations , such as t - duality @xcite , as as solution - generating technique ; starting from a known `` seed '' solution one applies this symmetry to generated a new solution .",
    "a particular example are the so - called tst transformations , which are a sequence of t - dualities ( t ) and coordinate shifts ( s ) leading to a continuous family of solutions @xcite .    in a series of works in recent years @xcite",
    ", it has been observed that classical @xmath4-matrices , which are solutions to the classical yang ",
    "baxter equation ( _ cybe _ in short ) , characterize various deformations of type iib supergravity backgrounds .",
    "one of the simplest examples is the correspondence between an abelian @xmath4-matrix , consisting of three cartan generators of @xmath5 , and the lunin - maldacena - frolov backgrounds @xcite obtained by tst transformations .",
    "the gravity duals of the 4d non - commutative gauge theory @xcite can also be obtained by certain @xmath4-matrices @xcite .",
    "these observations have led us to propose a correspondence between classical @xmath4-matrices and deformed supergravity solutions , which we refer to as the _ gravity / cybe correspondence _ @xcite .",
    "the reader may wonder how it is that @xmath4-matrices , which are purely algebraic objects , can be used to study geometric objects such as gravity backgrounds .",
    "the notion which makes this possible is _ yang - baxter sigma models_. these models , originally introduced by klimcik @xcite , are integrable deformations of the principal chiral model based on an @xmath4-matrix satisfying the _ modified _ classical yang - baxter equation ( _ mcybe _ in short ) .",
    "these were extended to sigma models defined on bosonic symmetric cosets @xcite , and applied to study an integrable deformation of the ads@xmath6s@xmath2 superstring @xcite in @xcite .",
    "we note that the work @xcite is the generalization of _ squashed sigma models _ defined on the squashed s@xmath7 , and their integrable structures have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the deformed metric and the ns - ns two - form of the deformed ads@xmath6s@xmath2 superstring were calculated in @xcite .",
    "however , the deformed background does not seem to be a supergravity solution for a generic value of the deformation parameter @xcite .",
    "deformations of the ads@xmath6s@xmath2 superstring by the cybe ( rather than by the mcybe ) were proposed in @xcite and the supergravity solution was constructed in @xcite .",
    "the generic formulation for group manifolds and bosonic cosets was introduced in @xcite .",
    "these works were inspired by a careful study of the three - dimensional case , namely _",
    "schrdinger sigma models _ @xcite .",
    "although the cybe is a particular case of the mcybe , their solutions seem to be very different .",
    "one of the advantages of using the cybe is the variety of classical @xmath4-matrices and partial deformations of the target space that are possible . in the case of the mcybe it seems difficult to find solutions , apart from the famous @xmath4-matrix of the drinfeld - jimbo type @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of yang - baxter deformations is that they preserve the integrability of the system , @xmath8 , if the undeformed model is integrable , so is the deformed model .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the initial focus was on studying deformations of known integrable models such as ads@xmath6s@xmath2 and four - dimensional minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "the various deformed lax pairs are summarized in @xcite and the expressions in terms of the local coordinates are presented .",
    "however , one may wonder whether integrability of the undeformed model is essential in the gravity / cybe correspondence , or if this correspondence may hold beyond integrability .",
    "if so , what are the resulting deformed backgrounds ?",
    "this question led us in @xcite to consider deformations of the sigma model defined on the five - dimensional sasaki - einstein space known as @xmath0 @xcite ( see also @xcite for relevant work ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , due to the appearance of chaotic behavior , this model is non - integrable .",
    "thus , this is a good testing ground for possible generalizations of the gravity / cybe correspondence in a non - integrable setting .",
    "another important aspect of @xmath0 is that it admits a sasaki - einstein metric and , as a consequence , ads@xmath9 is a good supergravity background .",
    "in fact , this was an early example @xcite of ads / cft with reduced supersymmetry .",
    "thus , the study of deformations of @xmath0 is also interesting from the holographic perspective .",
    "see @xcite for a two - parameter deformation of metrics on @xmath0 in terms of gauged linear sigma models , and @xcite for a one - parameter deformation and a study of supersymmetric localization of the two - dimensional sigma model on this space .    the first obstacle to apply the yang - baxter deformation to @xmath0 is how to describe the sasaki - einstein structure on the manifold by a coset .",
    "although it is well - known that @xmath0 @xcite is given by @xmath10 the `` canonical '' coset metric on the space is not the sasaki - einstein metric we are interested in .",
    "although this problem may be circumvented by a ( rather artificial ) rescaling of the vielbeins ( see app .",
    "a in @xcite for details and references ) , this is an unsatisfactory resolution from the point of view of the yang - baxter deformation ; since the coset construction above does not make the full @xmath11 symmetry of the space manifest , it is not clear how one may perform a general ( thee - parameter ) yang - baxter deformation of the space .",
    "as shown in @xcite a novel construction which solves all these problems is given by the coset @xmath12 although this coset is closely related to the one above , there is an important difference ; despite involving only bosonic groups , it is in fact a _ super - coset _ in the sense that one must think of these bosonic groups as the bosonic part of a larger supergroup ( this will be explained in detail below ) .",
    "although this construction might seem at first unnatural , a clear advantage is that the full symmetry appears in the numerator of the coset and is therefore manifest .",
    "furthermore , the fact that one should view this as a supercoset has a natural interpretation in terms of the @xmath13 superconformal group @xmath14 of the dual field theory .    having an appropriate description of the space as a coset , the next step is to apply the yang - baxter deformation . as a simple example we consider deformations associated with an abelian classical @xmath4-matrix , given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the cartan generators of two @xmath18 s respectively and @xmath19 is the @xmath20 generator of the numerator in and @xmath21 are three continuous parameters .",
    "note that if the @xmath22 was not present in the numerator , only a one - parameter deformation would be possible in this setting .",
    "although it is not guaranteed _ a - priori _ that such a deformation leads to a new supergravity background , it turns out that the deformed metric and the ns - ns two - form agree exactly with the ones obtained by tst - transformations @xcite ( in particular for @xmath23 , the deformed background reduces to the one given by lunin - maldacena @xcite ) , and is therefore a good supergravity background .",
    "thus , our result indicates that the yang - baxter sigma models based on the cybe can be applied beyond non - integrable cosets and the _ gravity / cybe correspondence _ seems to extend to a wider class of supergravity backgrounds than one may have expected .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : coset ] , we discuss the new coset construction of @xmath0 given in . in section [ sec : def ] , we apply the yang - baxter deformation and show that the resulting backgrounds coincide with the tst - transformed supergravity solutions , which corresponds to a @xmath24-deformation for the one - parameter case and to a @xmath25-deformation for the three - parameter case , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : con ] is devoted conclusions and discussions .",
    "let us start by recalling some basic elements .",
    "the five - dimensional space @xmath0 admits a sasaki - einstein metric , given by @xcite @xmath27 where the angle variables @xmath28 with @xmath29 are the coordinates of the two two - spheres and the coordinate @xmath30 is along the @xmath31-fiber .",
    "the isometry of this manifold is @xmath32 , an important fact when studying general ( abelian ) yang - baxter deformations below .      before going into the details of the coset description of @xmath0 ,",
    "let us review some basics of general coset spaces and their metrics .",
    "let @xmath33 be a homogeneous space , on which a lie group @xmath34 is acting . for a fixed point of @xmath33",
    "we take a subgroup @xmath35 which preserves the reference point .",
    "conceptually , @xmath34 is the global symmetry of the space @xmath33 and @xmath36 is the local symmetry around the fixed point .",
    "then , @xmath37 corresponds to the coset space @xmath38    a standard example of a coset space is the two - sphere s@xmath39 , whose global symmetry is @xmath40 . the residual symmetry around the north ( or south ) pole is @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to the well - known coset description of the two - sphere ; s@xmath42 .    to obtain the metric on @xmath33 from the coset , we need two ingredients .",
    "these are the maurer - cartan one - form @xmath43 and the coset projector @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the lie algebras associated with the lie group @xmath34 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "next , let us introduce the local coordinates @xmath47 through the parameterization of the group element @xmath48 , @xmath49 then , a metric @xmath50 on @xmath37 is obtained by @xmath51   = \\sum_{i , j=1}^{\\dim { \\cal m}}g_{ij}d\\theta^i d\\theta^j\\ , ,    \\label{usual coset metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the trace is taken over a particular representation of @xmath45 , which in our case will be the fundamental representation .",
    "now we discuss the ( super)coset construction of @xmath0 introduced in @xcite .",
    "unlike the usual description ( [ usual coset ] ) , we take the numerator to be the _ full _ isometry of the space and divide by an appropriate subgroup : @xmath52 we denote the generators of the two @xmath18 s by @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the cartan generators , and we denote the generator of @xmath20 by @xmath19 .",
    "the generators of @xmath55 in the denominator are denoted by @xmath56 ( @xmath29 ) , which we choose to be embedded into the numerator by @xmath57 we note that @xmath58 corresponds to the usual @xmath59 in the standard coset description @xcite , while @xmath60 has been chosen appropriately in order to obtain the metric we are after . with @xmath61",
    "non - negative integers are defined by the same coset @xmath62/u(1)_1 $ ] , but with @xmath63 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this explains why the manifold is called @xmath0 .",
    "]    the maurer - cartan one - form in our case is given by @xmath64 with the parameterization @xmath65 to define the coset projector explicitly , it is convenient to work with the fundamental representation . since those of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath68 and @xmath69 matrices , respectively",
    ", the whole lie algebra @xmath70 is represented by a @xmath71 block matrix .",
    "we , however , adopt the following @xmath72 _ super_-matrix instead of the @xmath71 bosonic block matrix , @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( @xmath54 ) are the pauli matrices . ] as we shall discuss in the next subsection , the appearance of the supermatrix is rather natural from the perspective of the full ten - dimensional ads@xmath75 coset space .",
    "since all off - diagonal blocks in are zero , there are no fermionic elements .",
    "thus , the essential difference in considering supermatrices , rather than bosonic ones , is that in computing the metric one must use the _",
    "super_trace @xmath76 , rather than the @xmath77 , which is defined by @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the bosonic and @xmath80 are the fermionic block matrices .",
    "the representation given in has the following normalization : @xmath81 now , we define the coset projector as follows ; @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath84 and @xmath85 follow from and . finally , with this prescription , the metric ( [ t11-metric ] ) is obtained by computing @xcite @xmath86\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      one may wonder about the significance of the appearance the supertrace @xmath76 , rather than the usual trace . although it would be interesting to address this question directly ( and study possible generalizations to other spaces ) , here we offer an explanation of the case at hand based on ads / cft . it is well known that backgrounds of the form ads@xmath87 , with @xmath88 a 5d sasaki - einstein manifold describe the gravity duals of certain @xmath13 superconformal field theories .",
    "the case @xmath89 was an early example proposed by klebanov - witten @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "according to the ads / cft dictionary , the isometries of the internal manifold @xmath88 translate into global symmetries of the dual field theory . in the canonical case of @xmath90 , the @xmath91 symmetry corresponds to the r - symmetry of the @xmath92 dual field theory . in the case of @xmath0 the @xmath20 part of the isometry corresponds to r - symmetry of the @xmath93 dual field theory , while the remaining @xmath94 corresponds to the flavor symmetry of the field theory .",
    "thus , these two symmetries should be physically distinguished .",
    "we recall that @xmath20 is included in the bosonic subgroup of the @xmath13 superconformal group @xmath14 as follows , @xmath95 thus , from the perspective of the ten - dimensional space ads@xmath9 , the internal manifold @xmath0 in appears naturally as the boconic part of the supercosets@xmath2 , in which case the supercoset reads @xmath96 in this case , the r - symmetry is @xmath97 and is a part of the @xmath98 superconformal algebra @xmath99.]@xmath100 here we have emphasized the @xmath0 part by the gray background . keeping in mind the above supercoset , the @xmath72 supermatrix in may be justified by interpreting the matrix as a part of the bigger @xmath101 supermatrix including the @xmath13 superconformal algebra as follows : @xmath102 in the larger supermatrix on the right of ( [ big supermatrix ] ) the @xmath13 superconformal algebra @xmath14 is sitting at the four corners , together with the eight supercharges @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) . from this supermatrix one",
    "easily recognizes that the lines separating the @xmath105-grading of the @xmath72 supermatrix on the left arises from the structure of the @xmath13 superconformal algebra @xmath14 on the right .",
    "thus , the appearance of supermatrices ( and with this particular grading ) is illuminated by ads / cft .",
    "now that we have discussed the coset in detail , we apply the yang - baxter sigma model approach to study deformations of this space . we will use a classical @xmath4-matrix @xcite .",

    "the main question addressed in this short article is whether the _ gravity / cybe correspondence _ @xcite can be extended beyond the integrable case .",
    "the answer seems to be yes , as first realized in @xcite and reviewed here .",
    "to recapitulate , we have shown this to be the case by means of an explicit example , namely the 5d sasaki - einstein space @xmath0 , which was shown to be non - integrable in @xcite . along the way to showing this we had to develop a novel ( super)coset construction for this space , namely . as discussed , unlike the standard coset construction , this prescription leads directly to the sasaki - einstein metric on the space and is specially suited to applying the yang - baxter deformation . although the origin of the supermatrix construction is not entirely clear from a purely mathematical standpoint , it is a rather natural construction from the viewpoint of the @xmath13 superconformal symmetry of the dual field theory .",

    "<S> yang - baxter sigma models , proposed by klimcik and delduc - magro - vicedo , have been recognized as a powerful framework for studying integrable deformations of two - dimensional non - linear sigma models . in this short article , as an important generalization , we review a _ non - integrable _ sigma model in the yang - baxter sigma model approach based on [ arxiv:1406.2249 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss a family of deformations of the 5d sasaki - einstein manifold @xmath0 , instead of the standard deformations of the @xmath1-sphere s@xmath2 . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we first describe a novel construction of @xmath0 as a supercoset , and provide a physical interpretation of this construction from viewpoint of the dual klebanov - witten field theory . </S>",
