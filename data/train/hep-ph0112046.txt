    "while the problem of electroweak symmetry breaking can be solved in the standard model ( sm ) by introducing one higgs boson , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) requires five physical higgses : a light cp - even ( @xmath6 ) , a heavy cp - even ( @xmath7 ) , a heavy cp - odd ( @xmath8 ) and two charged higgs bosons ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , the discovery of heavy neutral higgs bosons would be a major breakthrough in verifying the supersymmetric nature of the fundamental theory , which is one of the main physics goals of the large hadron collider project .",
    "+ the most promising channel to discover the heavy susy higgses is the @xmath10 @xcite channel , where both the leptonic and hadronic decays of the tau can be exploited .",
    "this channel has been shown to cover large parts of the intermediate and high @xmath11 region of the mssm parameter space for an integrated luminosity of 30 @xmath12 . for low values of @xmath11 ,",
    "the coupling of the higgs bosons to taus is not sufficiently enhanced and therefore this region is inaccessible for the @xmath13 channel .",
    "+ in all studies of the sm channels ( meaning that the susy higgses decay into standard model particles ) , it is assumed that sparticles are too heavy to participate in the decay process .",
    "one should ask what would happen if some of the sparticles would be light and the decays of higgs bosons into these susy particles would be kinematically allowed .",
    "indeed , the existence of light neutralinos ( @xmath14 ) , charginos ( @xmath15 ) and sleptons ( @xmath16 ) seems favoured by a large number of supersymmetric models in order to explain electroweak symmetry breaking without large fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "also recent experimental results ( precision measurements at lep2 @xcite , muon @xmath17 @xcite ) may point towards the existence of light gauginos and sleptons .",
    "+ light susy particles may jeopardize the higgs discovery potential of the sm channels , since their presence can drastically decrease the branching ratios of the higgses into sm particles .",
    "furthermore , pair and cascade production of light sparticles becomes an extra background to the higgs searches . on the other hand ,",
    "higgs bosons decaying into sparticles might open new possibilities to explore regions of parameter space where sm decays would not be accessible @xcite . in this note",
    "we report on a study of this type of decay with the cms detector .",
    "we will focus on the decay of the heavy neutral higgses @xmath7 and @xmath8 into two next - to - lightest neutralinos , with each of the neutralinos in turn decaying as @xmath1 , i.e. into two ( isolated ) leptons + @xmath2 , so we get @xmath18 this results in a clear four lepton final state signature .",
    "we will show that , as is often the case for supersymmetric channels , susy backgrounds are more difficult to suppress than the sm backgrounds . of the latter , basically only @xmath19 survives after requiring four isolated leptons .",
    "of the susy backgrounds , sneutrino pair production and sparticle cascade decay production of neutralinos are the most dangerous processes . using a set of selection criteria as described in section 5",
    ", we can clearly distinguish the signal from the background in the intermediate mass range 230 gev @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath20 450 gev and for low and intermediate values of @xmath11 , depending on the values of the other mssm parameters .",
    "the remainder of this note is organised as follows : first we study the behaviour of the relevant branching ratios .",
    "then we describe the event generation , the signal versus background discrimination methods , and the discovery potential of the channel in the @xmath21 - @xmath11 plane . as a next step",
    "we investigate the effects of varying the other mssm parameter values . in the last section",
    "the results are summarized .",
    "the main difficulty in studying decay modes involving supersymmetric particles is the large amount of free parameters in the mssm .",
    "therefore most studies are carried out in the msugra or gmsb context in order to reduce the number of free parameters ; we will however stick to the more general mssm framework , to avoid too many model dependent assumptions . as free parameters ,",
    "we take the mass of the cp - odd higgs @xmath21 , the higgs vev ratio @xmath5 , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath22 , the bino mass parameter @xmath23 , the wino mass parameter @xmath24 , the slepton mass @xmath25 and the squark / gluino mass @xmath26 . as a starting point for our studies",
    ", we will adopt the following framework :    h & +    &     +    * we consider light neutralinos and charginos , above the lep2 limits . initially , we fix @xmath23 at 60 gev , and using the renormalisation group relation @xmath24 @xmath27 2 @xmath23 , we can set @xmath24= 120 gev .",
    "we take @xmath28 .",
    "this large @xmath22 scenario is favoured in models where @xmath29 is the dark matter candidate , like msugra . in low @xmath22 scenarios , the decay of @xmath0 into leptons",
    "will be strongly suppressed . for large values of @xmath30",
    ", @xmath0 is rather wino and @xmath29 is bino - like .",
    "therefore it approximately holds that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the effects of varying these parameters will be discussed later on .",
    "* we also take sleptons to be light . in the most favourable case",
    "they would be lighter than @xmath0 , thereby allowing two - body decays into leptons .",
    "we will consider two scenarios : @xmath25 @xmath33 @xmath34 , where real decays of neutralinos into sleptons are allowed and @xmath25 @xmath35 @xmath34 , where only the virtual exchange is possible . * the masses of squarks and gluinos are kept at the 1 tev scale . in the mssm , it is natural that these sparticles are heavier than neutralinos and sleptons . in section 7 , we will investigate the effect of lowering the masses of squarks and gluinos .",
    "these parameter values and domains for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 will be used as default throughout this note .",
    "the exact values for @xmath22 and @xmath25 will be chosen after analysing and optimizing the @xmath36 cross sections through the mssm parameter space .",
    "after establishing the visibility in this optimal point , we will scan the area in @xmath37 around it to see how far the discovery region reaches .",
    "effects of varying the initial susy parameter values will be discussed .",
    "in order to determine the regions in mssm parameter space where sparticle decay modes may be accessible , we will first discuss the behaviour of the relevant branching ratios .",

    ", the probability for the heavy higgses to decay into susy particles can be as high as 20 % . in this mass region ,",
    "the decay mode to @xmath42 has the highest branching ratio ( br ) , however it produces a final state with only two leptons",
    ". this mode would be in competition with numerous sm and susy backgrounds .",

    "this channel can provide four leptons and is thus a priori more appropriate for obtaining a good signal to background ratio .",
    "the @xmath43 threshold is determined by our choice of @xmath24 ( @xmath44 ) = 120 gev ; the fall in br at @xmath41 @xmath35 350 gev is caused by the opening of the @xmath45 mode .",
    "the partial decay widths into supersymmetric particles remain the same as for lower values of @xmath41 , but due to the opening of the @xmath45 mode , the total decay width increases and the branching ratio into charginos / neutralinos decreases . for values of @xmath41 @xmath33 350 gev ,",
    "the br of the cp - odd higgs ( @xmath8 ) into gauginos is substantially higher than in the cp - even ( @xmath7 ) case .",
    "this is due to the fact that for the cp - even higgs more couplings to sm particles are allowed , thus leading to a larger total decay width and smaller br s to sparticles . for high values of @xmath21 the br s",
    "are about the same for @xmath7 and @xmath8 since one reaches the decoupling regime . also for higher masses ,",
    "other neutralino modes like @xmath46 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 may open up which will contribute to the four lepton signal .",
    "the next - to - lightest neutralino @xmath0 will decay into two fermions and the lightest neutralino : @xmath49 .",

    "we will only focus on the case where the neutralino decays into two leptons @xmath51 , where @xmath52 = @xmath53 or @xmath22 .",
    "this process is determined by the bino , wino and higgsino mass parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath22 , by @xmath11 and by the slepton masses @xmath25 .",
    "if sleptons are heavier than the @xmath0 , and as long as direct decays into a @xmath54 boson are not allowed ( or suppressed ) , only three - body decays @xmath51 will contribute .",
    "these decays are mediated by virtual slepton and @xmath54 exchange @xcite .",
    "therefore it is more favourable to have light sleptons in order to have larger br s .",
    "the decay branching ratios can be rather sensitive to the mssm parameters due to the fact that the @xmath54 and slepton exchange amplitudes may interfere constructively as well as destructively .",

    "they are dangerous because of their large cross sections at the lhc . in order to distinguish between events coming from the signal and from the sm background , we apply the following selection criteria :    * we require two pairs of isolated leptons with opposite sign and same flavour , with a @xmath75 larger than 10 gev and within @xmath76 @xmath33 2.4 .",
    "the isolation criterion demands that there are no charged particles with @xmath75 @xmath35 1.5 gev in a cone of r = 0.3 rad around each lepton track , and that the sum of the transverse energy in the crystal towers between r = 0.05 and r = 0.3 rad is smaller than 3 gev . *",
    "all dilepton pairs of opposite sign and same flavour that have an invariant mass in the range @xmath77 gev are rejected ( z veto ) .    demanding four tightly isolated leptons with a transverse momentum higher than 10 gev is a powerful requirement in fighting the @xmath45 and @xmath72 background .",
