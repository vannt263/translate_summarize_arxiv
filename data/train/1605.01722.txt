    "legendre s conjecture states that there exists at least a prime number between @xmath1 and @xmath2 for all natural numbers.if this conjecture is correct , the gap between any prime @xmath3 and the next largest prime would always be at most on the order @xmath4 or gaps are @xmath5.this conjecture has been recognized to have not been solved since over 200 years ago . in section 3 ,",
    "we prove andrica s conjecture @xcite in the two ways.andricas conjecture states that the inequality @xmath6 holds for all @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath7th prime number.in section 4 , oppermann s conjecture is proven for every @xmath9 .",
    "this conjecture is one of the unsolved problems in number theory , specifically on the distrbution of primes and was proposed by mathematician ludvig oppermann in 1882@xcite.oppermanns conjecture states that there is at least one prime as @xmath10 and one prime as @xmath11 so that @xmath12 for natural numbers @xmath13",
    ". if the conjecture is true , then the largest possible gaps between two consecutive prime numbers could be at most proportional to twice the square root of numbers.in section 5 , brocard s conjecture using the proven oppermann s conjecture is proved.the conjecture says us that there exist at least four primes between @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath7th prime number . in section 6 , we make a proof for cramr s conjecture.cramrs conjecture@xcitestates that gaps between consecutive prime numbers can have a supermum 1 with regard to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 refers to natural logarithm throughout the paper ) as @xmath19.in section 7 , an easily proof of shanks conjecture is made.shanks conjecture @xcite ( ( @xmath20 ) gives a somewhat stronger statement than cramr s . in sections 8 to 12 , we make the proofs of the first , second , third and fifth smarandache s conjctures@xcite,@xciteusing proven firoozbakht s conjcture , kourbatov s theorem 1 , and proven andrica s conjecture and a disproof of his fourth conjecture in some special cases .",
    "these conjctures generalize andrica s conjcture and will be discussed in detail in their related sections .",
    "as we should know , legendre s conjecture states that there exists at least a prime number between @xmath1 and @xmath2 for all natural numbers .    *",

    "oppermann s conjecture trivially holds for @xmath104 and consequently holds for @xmath13 .",
