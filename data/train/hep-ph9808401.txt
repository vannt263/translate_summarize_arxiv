    "<S> gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking theories provide an interesting alternative to the usual gravity - mediated scenarios in transmitting supersymmetry breaking effects to the low energy world @xcite ( for a review , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . among the most attractive features of these theories is the natural suppression of flavour - violating interactions which is guaranteed by the gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in addition low - energy phenomenology is now governed by the fact that the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle and this may lead to interesting collider signals .    </S>",

    "<S> the relevant parameters which define the gauge - mediated model are the messenger index @xmath5 ( twice the sum of the dynkin indices of the messenger gauge representations ) , and the supersymmetric and supersymmetry - breaking messenger mass parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> more details on the definition of the parameters can be found in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the nlsp is not stable and eventually will decay into the gravitino . if these decays occur during the nucleosynthesis epoch the light element abundances can be drastically altered  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the nlsp is a neutralino the dominant decay mode produces a photon which affects the primordial @xmath14he abundance . on the other hand hadronic decays </S>",
    "<S> can also prove dangerous for the nucleosynthesis products . in the case of the neutralino nlsp , </S>",
    "<S> the photon can hadronise or , in the case of a stau nlsp , the semileptonic decay of a tau lepton can produce hadronic showers which leads to energetic nucleons . even though nucleosynthesis may be over , </S>",
    "<S> these energetic nucleons destroy @xmath14he or synthesise @xmath15he and tritium leading to the overproduction of the light elements . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively if the nlsp actually decays hadronically during nucleosynthesis these nucleons will instead establish thermal equilibrium with the surrounding plasma by colliding with the ambient protons and @xmath14he leading to the eventual increase of the @xmath16 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a greater abundance of @xmath14he , @xmath15he and deuterium d.    in order to avoid the destructive effects on the nucleosynthesis products the lifetime of the nlsp must be restricted so as to decay sufficiently well before it can interfere with the nucleosynthesis products or if it decays during nucleosynthesis that the enhanced light element abundances are consistent with astrophysical observations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the abundance of the nlsp at the time of decay will also be important . </S>",
    "<S> since the abundance and lifetime are related to the messenger scale @xmath6 , an upper bound can be placed on the messenger scale ( for a typical set of the other gauge - mediated parameters ) , depending on whether the neutralino or stau is the nlsp . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds will be shown to be fairly generic for most of the parameter space of gauge - mediated theories .    </S>",

    "<S> this amounts to calculating the nlsp abundance at the time of freeze out when the nlsp is no longer in chemical equilibrium .    </S>",

    "<S> for moderate values of @xmath12 , @xmath4 is lighter than the neutralino whenever @xmath18 ^ 2~. \\label{limn}\\ ] ] for large @xmath19 this region becomes slightly larger because of the stau left - right mixing . in order to determine the nlsp abundance we consider all relevant channels which change the number of nlsp s . when the nlsp is a neutralino the most relevant annihilation channels are those consisting of fermions and gauge bosons as depicted in table  [ annch ] . </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation channels into higgs bosons are suppressed because the lightest neutralino is mainly @xmath13-ino . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason , the neutralino nlsp generically is not degenerate in mass with other particles , so it will not be important to consider coannihilations for this case . </S>",
    "<S> we can also neglect annihilation channels which involve gravitino vertices since these lead to scattering amplitudes which are suppressed by a factor @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested in nlsp lifetimes of the order of the nucleosynthesis timescale , this suppression makes all gravitino - emission processes negligible .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ massd ] ) is always positive . </S>",
    "<S> because of the approximate mass degeneracy among the sleptons , the calculation of the stau relic abundance must include all coannihilation processes listed in table  [ annch ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also need to compute the smuon and selectron density at the decoupling time , since these `` co - nlsp s '' are also responsible for producing damaging decay products .    </S>",
    "<S> the nlsp abundance is determined by considering the evolution of the number density @xmath26 of particle @xmath27 which is governed by the boltzmann equation . in the presence of coannihilations </S>",
    "<S> the boltzmann equation can be written as  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hubble expansion parameter , @xmath30 and the thermal average of the effective cross section is defined as @xmath31 the individual cross sections @xmath32 include the processes listed in table  [ annch ] , @xmath33 is the relative velocity and @xmath34 is the equilibrium number density .    </S>",

    "<S> the ratio @xmath36 of the equilibrium number density @xmath34 to the entropy density @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the number of internal degrees of freedom and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the nlsp abundance @xmath42 at the time of nucleosynthesis is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the freezeout temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the freezeout temperature is determined from the condition @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus in the case of the neutralino nlsp the abundance @xmath42 is just simply @xmath46 while for the stau nlsp it will be @xmath47 which is the sum of all the `` co - nlsp '' abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of including the coannihilating channels between the stau and the `` co - nlsp s '' changes the pure stau abundance by up to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ stauabundfig ] where the stau abundance with and without coannihilations is shown . notice the important reduction of the relic abundance for values of @xmath49 close to half the higgs mass , caused by the resonant annihilation channel . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted , however that given the present lep bound on stable @xmath50 , this possibility is no longer realistic for the stau .    5.8 truein    * 3 . * </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the effect of the nlsp decaying during the nucleosynthesis epoch . </S>",
    "<S> suppose first that the nlsp is a neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant decay mode of the neutralino is into a photon and gravitino with a decay rate given by  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the nlsp gaugino components in standard notation . </S>",
    "<S> there are also other decay modes which involve the @xmath54 or a higgs boson , but these modes are suppressed by a @xmath55 phase - space factor . </S>",
    "<S> the photon of the dominant decay mode has a dramatic effect on the light element abundance . in the radiation dominated thermal background </S>",
    "<S> high energy photons initiate electromagnetic cascades and create many low - energy photons capable of photodissociating the light elements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these photodissociation effects caused by the photon of the decaying neutralino can be parametrised by a `` damage '' factor @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the baryon - to - photon number density ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity @xmath58 is constrained by astrophysical observations of light elements . recently </S>",
    "<S> new observations of the @xmath24 and @xmath14he primordial abundance have led to a reanalysis of the constraints on the abundance and lifetime of long - lived particles  @xcite . in particular , controversy in the measurement of primordial deuterium have led to two different values for the deuterium abundance @xmath59 ( normalised to hydrogen ) . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a high value of the deuterium abundance @xmath60 is quoted while in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a low value @xmath61 is obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> the neutralino abundance @xmath46 depends on the details of the sparticle spectrum and can be calculated for a particular choice of the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath19 and @xmath62 . using the constraints in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dgfig ] the bound on the messenger scale for a representative neutralino nlsp scenario in which @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for both high and low values of the measured @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also assumed that @xmath66 and the limiting value of @xmath6 grows approximately linearly with @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the high deuterium value gives a slightly more stringent bound than the low deuterium value , because for lifetimes less than @xmath68 seconds deuterium is effectively photodissociated .    </S>",
    "<S> 5.8 truein    the bound will change slightly for different values of the gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking parameters , but typically for the neutralino nlsp scenario lifetimes greater than @xmath69 seconds are ruled out by photodissociations .    </S>",
    "<S> note that photodissociations are only important after nucleosynthesis is over ( which corresponds to times later than @xmath70 seconds ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because during earlier times when thermal photons are more energetic and numerous , photon - photon interactions are much more probable than photon - nucleus interactions . </S>",
    "<S> consequently stronger constraints can only be obtained if we consider processes that affect nucleosynthesis at times earlier than @xmath70 seconds .    </S>",
    "<S> however before discussing the relevant processes for times earlier than @xmath70 seconds it is possible to obtain stronger constraints than those from photodissociations by considering hadronic decays of the nlsp  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the nlsp decays hadronically during times @xmath71 seconds then the photodissociation bound needs to be reconsidered since while d is destroyed by photodissociation it can be produced by the hadronic showers . </S>",
    "<S> in fact even if the nlsp decays exclusively into photons it is possible that hadronic showers will be generated . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect of hadronic showers is not only to increase the abundance of d but also the other light nuclei @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in particular d and @xmath15he arise mainly from `` hadrodestruction '' processes , which occur when an energetic nucleon breaks up the ambient @xmath14he nucleus into d and @xmath15he . </S>",
    "<S> the other light nuclei , @xmath74 and @xmath73 arise from `` hadrosynthesis '' of @xmath15he , t or @xmath14he . </S>",
    "<S> more complete details can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again the `` damage '' of the hadronic decays on the primordial nuclear abundances can be parametrised as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an effective baryonic branching ratio which depends on the true baryonic branching ratio @xmath77 , the baryonic multiplicity @xmath78 and a factor @xmath79 representing the dependence of the yields on the energy of the primary shower baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the contributions to the neutralino hadronic branching ratio comes from the decay @xmath80 @xmath81 where the hadronic branching ratio of the @xmath54-boson is 0.7 , and we have assumed a pure @xmath13-ino . </S>",
    "<S> although this contribution , and the analogous one from higgs decay , can be forbidden by phase space , there is always at least a contribution to @xmath77 of order @xmath82 from photon conversion into a @xmath83 pair . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit expression for @xmath77 can be obtained from eq .  ( </S>",
    "<S> 13 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . using the corresponding value of @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that the overproduction of @xmath85li constrains the lifetime of the neutralino to be shorter than @xmath70 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> this is also true if the nlsp is the stau . </S>",
    "<S> the stau decays predominantly into a tau and gravitino and since the tau has a large hadronic branching ratio , the corresponding value of @xmath84 is much larger than that for the neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the lifetime of the stau must also be less than @xmath70 seconds if the overproduction of @xmath85li is to be avoided  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that in order to obtain precise constraints on the abundance and lifetime of the nlsp we need to consider processes occuring at times earlier than @xmath70 seconds . at these times </S>",
    "<S> the main decay products that interfere with nucleosynthesis are hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> hadronic showers induce interconversions between the ambient protons and neutrons thus changing the equilibrium @xmath16 ratio  @xcite . in particular during the lifetime interval @xmath86 seconds the overall effect of the hadronic decays is to convert protons into neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> the additional neutrons that are produced are all synthesised into @xmath14he and thus hadronic decays during this time interval are constrained by the observational upper bound on the primordial helium abundance @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> eventually the neutron fraction falls to zero because all neutrons are contained in the @xmath14he nuclei and the remaining neutrons created by the nlsp decay increase the deuterium d abundance . furthermore for @xmath88 seconds the @xmath15he abundance </S>",
    "<S> is also increased by d - d burning . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath89 seconds all the neutrons arising from nlsp decay will themselves decay before forming d. thus in the interval @xmath90 seconds the appropriate constraint on hadronic decays arises from the observational bounds on @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> the overall effect of these hadronic decays has been considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the constraints on the abundance and lifetime of the decaying particle are parametrised by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of jets , @xmath77 is the hadronic branching ratio and @xmath94 is the average charge multiplicity for a jet with energy @xmath95 and is given by @xmath96.\\ ] ] since at the parton level the neutralino nlsp decays into three particles we will assume that @xmath97 and @xmath93 is the number of quarks at the parton level . in the case of the stau in which the tau decays semi - leptonically we assume @xmath98 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most stringent constraints on the nlsp abundance and lifetime in the interval @xmath90 seconds come from the primordial deuterium abundance . </S>",
    "<S> previous constraints on @xmath99 and the lifetime were obtained for @xmath100 and @xmath101  @xcite . in order to use the more recent measurements , we rescale the previous constraints for the new values @xmath60 or @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this rescaling can be done analytically by using the change in the deuterium abundance  @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the hydrogen density , @xmath104 is the fraction of injected neutrons that end up in deuterium and @xmath105 is the number of @xmath106 pairs per nlsp decay . </S>",
    "<S> this equation is valid as long as @xmath107 , which conveniently holds whenever the deuterium constraint is important . </S>",
    "<S> since the limit comes from the overproduction of deuterium and the standard @xmath59 prediction decreases with @xmath57 , we make the most conservative choice of @xmath108 , which is the largest value compatible with @xmath14he and @xmath109li abundances .    when the high value of the deuterium abundance is used , one obtains no constraints in the region @xmath90 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> all values of the nlsp abundance and lifetime are consistent with high @xmath59 value and consequently there is no improvement on the lifetime upper bound of @xmath70 seconds obtained from the overabundance of @xmath85li .    on the other hand stringent constraints in the interval @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> seconds are obtained when the low value of the deuterium abundance is used . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the two nlsp scenarios separately . </S>",
    "<S> first , when the nlsp is the neutralino the scaling parameter @xmath110 is determined using @xmath111 and @xmath112 . rescaling the solid curve of fig .  4 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite enables one to determine the constraint arising from the low value of @xmath59 and @xmath113 . thus calculating the value for the neutralino number density for a generic set of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking parameters leads to constraints on the abundance and lifetime of the neutralino which can be expressed as a bound on the messenger scale @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dbneutfig ] . </S>",
    "<S> the bound on @xmath114 does not significantly depend on the value of @xmath19 , but grows approximately linearly with @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> 5.8 truein    let us now discuss the case of the stau nlsp . at the decoupling time , the abundances of smuons and selectrons are comparable to the stau abundance . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological fate of the frozen - out smuons and selectrons depends on the mass difference in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ massd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath12 is large , then @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) and the decay @xmath117 is kinematically open . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath19 for which this transition occurs depends on the parameter choice , but it is typically of order 10 , as it can be estimated from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ massd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if this mode is accessible , it dominates over the two - body decay into gravitino . </S>",
    "<S> this can be simply understood from the decay rate expression  @xcite in the limit of vanishing lepton masses and small slepton mass difference , @xmath118 @xmath119 here @xmath120 is the mass of the @xmath13-ino which mediates the decay , and is assumed to be much larger than @xmath121 . in this case , smuons and selectrons decay soon after decoupling , with each one producing a stau in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the relevant stau abundance at the nucleosynthesis epoch is determined by the sum over the three slepton abundances at the decoupling time . </S>",
    "<S> the stau hadronic branching fraction comes from the semileptonic tau decay , and it is given by @xmath122 .    for smaller values of @xmath19 the neutralino - mediated three - body process is forbidden , and the rates of the two competing slepton decay modes are @xmath123 @xmath124 here @xmath125 is the chargino ( gaugino ) mass which mediates the decay , and @xmath126 , @xmath127 are the left - right mixing angles in the slepton system . </S>",
    "<S> the process in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dgra ] ) is suppressed by the large value of @xmath7 required in our study of nucleosynthesis and the process in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dneu ] ) is suppressed by the small mixing angles proportional to the corresponding lepton masses . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that in the small @xmath19 regime and for @xmath128 gev , the two rates are comparable when @xmath129 gev , which is just the value of @xmath130 necessary to have a stau decay during nucleosynthesis . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> depending on the particular choice of the gauge mediation parameters , we can encounter different situations . </S>",
    "<S> the first possibility is that @xmath131 , in which all light sleptons decay directly into gravitinos around the same time . in this case </S>",
    "<S> smuons and selectrons do not significantly contribute to the effective hadronic branching fraction , because real electrons and muons can not decay into hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath19 is increased and @xmath132 is decreased , we go first to a regime in which @xmath133 and then in a regime in which the three - body decays dominate for both @xmath134 and @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> the two regimes are possible because the decay process in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dneu ] ) depends on the lepton mass through the left - right mixing angle . in the first regime , </S>",
    "<S> only the smuon contributes to the effective hadronic branching fraction , while in the second one both the smuon and selectron contribute .    with respect to a neutralino nlsp of equal mass , a stau nlsp has a larger hadronic branching ratio @xmath77 , but a smaller relic abundance because of the additional annihilation channels . </S>",
    "<S> the two effects roughly compensate each other , although the bound on the nlsp lifetime is slighly weaker in the @xmath50 case . </S>",
    "<S> when expressed in terms of @xmath6 , the bound appears even weaker because we have to choose a very large value of @xmath5 in order to satisfy the requirement of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ limn ] ) for a stau nlsp . </S>",
    "<S> the bound on the messenger mass for @xmath136 and @xmath137 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dbstaufig ] . for this choice of parameters , the selectron and the smuon dominantly decay directly into gravitinos . in the figure </S>",
    "<S> we only show the bound arising from the low deuterium value . </S>",
    "<S> the bound for the high deuterium value corresponds to a lifetime which can not be achieved for this choice of @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> truein    * 4 . * </S>",
    "<S> although the mass spectrum of supersymmetric theories with gauge mediation can be predicted in terms of a few parameters , the experimental and cosmological features of the theory can drastically change as the messenger mass @xmath6 is varied in the allowed range between about 100 tev and @xmath138 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus very important to study possible constraints on the value of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement that the nlsp decay products do not upset the successful predictions of standard big - bang nucleosynthesis provides such a constraint . </S>",
    "<S> here we have studied in detail the effects of the decaying nlsp on the light - element primordial abundances and shown that the most dangerous damages come from the hadronic decay modes . </S>",
    "<S> after computing the nlsp relic abundance , including coannihilation effects , we conclude that the injection of hadronic jets in the universe at times later than @xmath70 seconds grossly overproduces @xmath85li . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for both neutralino and stau nlsp . at earlier times , </S>",
    "<S> the most relevant bounds come from deuterium overproduction . at present </S>",
    "<S> , there is a disagreement on the extracted observational value of the primordial deuterium . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath61  @xcite , no further limit on the nlsp is derived , while with @xmath60  @xcite the limit from @xmath85li can be improved . </S>",

    "<S> it is also interesting to notice that the nucleosynthesis bound discussed here is complementary to the bound obtained from gravitino overabundance . </S>",
    "<S> indeed when @xmath140 is larger than about a kev , gravitinos which were in thermal equilibrium at early times , give a contribution to the present energy density larger than the critical value . </S>",
