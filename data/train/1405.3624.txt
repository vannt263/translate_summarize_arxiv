    "it is often claimed that an overdense region in an expanding friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background can not extend too far , else it would be a separate closed universe rather than a region in our universe .",
    "this was first argued by carr and hawking  @xcite forty years ago and is particularly relevant to the formation of a primordial black hole ( pbh ) from an initial inhomogeneity because the region has to be quite close to the separate - universe limit in order to collapse against the pressure ( at least in a radiation - dominated era ) .",
    "a simple way to understand this is to regard the overdense region as part of a closed ( @xmath5 ) frw model in a flat ( @xmath6 ) frw background  @xcite .",
    "if the size of the region is big enough to include the entire closed frw model , then it clearly can not be part of _ our _ universe .",
    "if one considers the region at maximum expansion , when it has some density @xmath7 , then the curvature of the spacelike hypersurface must be of order @xmath8 and so the limiting scale is of order @xmath9 .",
    "the density @xmath7 exceeds the density of the flat frw background at that time by a factor @xmath10 which depends on the equation of state .",
    "if this has the form @xmath11 for some constant @xmath3 , then @xmath12 is a simple function of @xmath3 and the separate - universe scale is just the particle horizon size times a numerical factor which depends on this .",
    "the precise expression for @xmath13 was first calculated iby harada and carr  @xcite . the minimum size for a pbh is the jeans length , which is a factor @xmath14 smaller than the particle horizon size , so pbhs can only form over a narrow range of scales unless @xmath3 is very small ( as in a dust era ) .",
    "the above argument is simplistic because a real overdense region would not have a constant density profile ( as required for a closed frw model ) and would need to be surrounded by an underdense region ( as required by the flat frw background assumption ) .",
    "it is also unrealistic to model a region which evolves into a pbh as a uniform overdensity .",
    "however , at least in this context more realistic calculations  which assume some form of density profile in the overdense region  have been performed  @xcite and these roughly support the simplistic analysis .",
    "nobody has yet done the equivalent calculation for the separate universe problem , even though the two problems are closely related .",
    "another point is that , although one can calculate the separate - universe condition by considering an overdense region at maximum expansion , this is a rather strange way of doing the calculation . if the overdense region is a separate universe at maximum expansion , it always was and always will be a separate universe .",
    "it does not _ evolve _ into a separate universe because the topology can not change in classical relativity .",
    "so there should be a more direct way of doing the calculation which is time - independent and just depends upon the total energy perturbation .",
    "however , since one is dealing with fluctuations on scales initially much larger than the particle horizon , one has to be careful which measure of the perturbation is used since this is gauge - dependent  @xcite . the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite uses the _",
    "gauge , which is convenient if one considers overdense regions at maximum expansion .",
    "recently , the separate - universe problem has been revisited and elucidated by kopp _",
    "_ @xcite ( khw ) .",
    "in particular , they describe the situation in terms of the _ curvature _ perturbation and are not restricted to analysing the problem at the time of the overdense region s maximum expansion .",
    "they provide some important new conceptual insights into the problem .",
    "in particular , if one considers overdense regions of increasing size at a given epoch , they emphasize that the misner - sharp mass reaches a maximum and then decreases to zero at the separate - universe scale .",
    "the density fluctuation also goes to zero there , although the curvature perturbation diverges . in this sense , they claim that the separate - universe condition is naturally avoided , with the strongest constraint on the density fluctuations coming from a scale which is smaller by a factor of two .",
    "fluctuations are described as ` type i ' and ` type ii ' according to whether they are smaller or larger than this scale .",
    "khw criticize the carr - hawking ( ch ) analysis , and also implicitly the harada - carr ( hc ) analysis , on this basis .",
    "the original ch analysis was certainly simplistic , so it is surprising that it has gone unchallenged for 40 years .",
    "in particular , neither ch nor hc differentiated between type i and type ii fluctuations and they did not appreciate that the mass of the overdense region tends to zero and the curvature perturbation diverges as one approaches the separate - universe scale .",
    "this means that one can not constrain primordial density perturbations , as originally claimed by ch .",
    "this is an important insight which changes one s interpretation of the problem .",
    "the use of embedding and conformal diagrams by khw is also illuminating .",
    "nevertheless , we have a somewhat different perspective of the problem .",
    "we agree that there are some inadequacies in the ch and hc analyses and part of the purpose of this paper is to remedy these .",
    "however , we argue that the concept of separate - universe scale still applies and that the hc analysis provides the correct expression for this .",
    "indeed , this expression has an important physical implication since it relates to the maximum mass of a pbh forming at any epoch in the history of the universe .",
    "it must be stressed that our previous analysis only applied for @xmath13 ( although the expression we gave is valid for @xmath15 ) , while that of khw is even more restricted , just focussing on the dust ( @xmath16 ) and radiation ( @xmath17 ) cases . on the other hand , the observed acceleration of the universe  @xcite can only be explained if the universe is dominated by some form of ` dark energy '  either a quintessence field  @xcite or a perfect fluid with @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this would also have applied during any inflationary period in the early universe .",
    "the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite does not apply in these situations .",
    "indeed , the whole concept of a small initial overdensity growing until it reaches some maximum expansion fails because density fluctuations _ decay _ with time for @xmath20 .",
    "so if overdense regions or black holes really can exist in such a universe , one essentially has to put them in at the outset ( or at least the non - linear inhomogeneities which lead to them ) .",
    "this problem is topical because recently a one - parameter family of spherically symmetric self - similar solutions has been found which contains black holes in an asymptotically frw background with @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "this means that the black hole grows at the same rate as the cosmological horizon ( interpreted as the hubble horizon since there is no particle horizon in this case ) .",
    "what is surprising about these solutions is that the black hole can not be too _ large _ compared to the cosmological horizon : when the ratio of the sizes is too big ( above @xmath21 in the @xmath22 case ) , one gets a cosmological _ wormhole _ ( which connects two exact frw models ) instead of a black hole  @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs when the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons merge .",
    "by contrast , in the positive pressure case ( @xmath13 ) , the black hole can not be too _ small _ because the solution must be supersonic everywhere .",
    "the minimum size roughly corresponds to the jeans condition .",
    "there are various other differences between these solutions .",
    "one is that , while the black hole solutions are only asymptotically quasi - frw in the @xmath15 case , because there is a solid angle deficit at infinity  @xcite , they are exactly asymptotically frw in the @xmath23 case .",
    "another is that in @xmath15 case the self - similar black hole solutions tend to a ` universal black hole ' ( in the sense that there is no cosmological particle horizon or black hole event horizon ) as the parameter which describes them ( a measure of the overdensity at large distances ) gets sufficiently large .",
    "however , there is no such limiting solution in the wormhole case and this raises the question of whether wormholes replace separate universes for @xmath23 or merely represent an _ intermediate _ situation .",
    "we also need to know whether this feature is specific to the self - similar situation or applies more generally . in any case",
    ", the nature of the separate universe condition in the @xmath24 situation clearly needs to be clarified . in an accompanying paper  @xcite",
    ", we discuss the link between black holes and wormholes in a cosmological background in more detail .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "ii presents some general considerations , summarizing our previous approach to the separate - universe problem and emphasizing the ways in which it needs to be improved .",
    "iii covers the @xmath15 case and generalizes previous treatments of the problem .",
    "iv covers the more challenging @xmath25 case , which has not been treated before .",
    "vi highlights some further aspects of the problem which remain to be explored .",
    "we make a more detailed comparison with the khw analysis in appendix a and include some mathematical details in appendix b.",
    "in this section , we first recall the usual argument for a separate - universe scale . we then discuss various inadequacies in this argument , many of them pointed out by khw . finally , we present a more rigorous analysis , in which the concept of a separate - universe scale is still shown to apply .",
    "we have no technical disagreement with the khw analysis but we reformulate the problem in a way which relates more closely to the analysis of ch and hc .",
    "we take the cosmological background to be a flat ( @xmath6 ) frw model with equation of state @xmath0 , in which the line element is given by @xmath26 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : metric_flat_friedmann}\\ ] ] here @xmath27 is a dimensionless comoving radial coordinate and the scale length @xmath28 obeys the friedmann equation @xmath29 with a dot denoting @xmath30 .",
    "this implies the background scale length and density evolve as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the time since the big bang .",
    "the size of the background particle horizon ( i.e. the proper radial distance travelled by light since the big bang ) is @xmath33 however , this expression diverges as @xmath34 and is inapplicable for @xmath23 , so it is generally more useful to refer to the hubble horizon : @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "both horizons scale as @xmath32 but they have a different @xmath3-dependence and are equal only for @xmath17 . the hubble horizon is smaller than the particle horizon for @xmath37 and only diverges as @xmath38 . since the mass within radius @xmath39 is @xmath40 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : flat_friedmann ] ) implies @xmath41 so the hubble horizon is also equivalent to the cosmological _ apparent _ horizon .",
    "however , this only applies in a flat frw model , when there is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath42 .    in order to describe the growth of an overdense region ,",
    "one treats it as a homogeneous sphere which is part of a closed ( @xmath5 ) frw model , an overdense region necessarily having positive curvature .",
    "the friedmann equation then becomes @xmath43 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flat_friedmann ] ) and ( [ eq : closed_friedmann ] ) , one can deduce the first order equation for the evolution of a small density perturbation relative to the flat frw background .",
    "this is defined as @xmath44 with respect to the synchronous gauge and evolves according to @xmath45 this gives a general solution @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constants .",
    "we took @xmath49 in our previous analysis because only the @xmath47 term represents a curvature perturbation ; the decaying @xmath48 term merely corresponds to a shift in the big bang time @xmath50 , such a shift implying @xmath51 however , the separate - universe condition can be modified by this effect if there is a curvature perturbation as well , so we extend the present analysis to include the @xmath48 term .",
    "we will want to apply eq .",
    "( [ growth ] ) for all values of @xmath3 in the range @xmath52 to @xmath53 , since these are physically well motivated .",
    "both terms decay with time for @xmath23 but the first term decays more slowly for @xmath54 .",
    "we first focus on the @xmath55 case and present an approximate argument of the kind used in ref .  @xcite . at some initial time",
    "@xmath56 , when the horizon mass is @xmath57 , let the density fluctuation in the positive curvature region extend to a scale @xmath58 and have amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "if we assume that the region stops expanding when @xmath60 , then eq .  ( [ growth ] ) implies that the time at which this happens and its size and the horizon size then are given by @xmath61 ( the subscript m indicates that these conditions pertain when the radius of the region attains its ` maximum ' . )",
    "the precise type of horizon ( particle or hubble ) is not crucial for the rough analysis presented here but it was taken to be the particle horizon in the original papers .",
    "note that the terms involving @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ rough ] ) are large since @xmath62 is small and all the exponents are negative for @xmath55 .    at maximum expansion , the spatial hypersurface has a radius of curvature of order @xmath63 and the friedmann equation implies that this is around the horizon size .",
    "therefore the region would close upon itself and form a separate universe if it were larger than this @xcite .",
    "this situation is avoided providing @xmath64 giving a limit on the initial density perturbation as a function of scale and mass : @xmath65 this is the limit first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , for collapse to a black hole",
    ", @xmath66 must exceed the jeans length , which is usually taken to be @xmath67 , so pbh formation requires @xmath68 and the density perturbation needs to be finely tuned @xcite .",

    "( [ particle ] ) , this happens at a time and density contrast @xmath69 providing @xmath70 is small ; this will turn out to be the condition for @xmath71 to precede the maximum expansion epoch .",

    "one therefore requires @xmath76 although this means that the density perturbation at horizon crossing is not strictly in the linear regime .",

    "subsequent numerical work in the radiation case ( @xmath17 ) suggests that this estimate for the lower limit is quite accurate , despite all the approximations involved .",
    "while earlier work gave a value of order @xmath21 @xcite , more recent studies have reduced this to the range @xmath78 @xcite and calculations of pbh formation in the context of critical phenomena give the range @xmath79 @xcite . a recent refinement of the analytical constraint ( [ eq : traditional ] ) , which is in a better agreement with the numerical results , gives @xmath80 in the radiation case  @xcite .      in a more rigorous analysis , the significance of almost every quantity in the above analysis ( @xmath39 , @xmath59 , @xmath81 , @xmath42 , @xmath82 ) needs to be considered more carefully .",

    "( [ densitylimit ] ) in this limit , since the right - hand side diverges .",
    "one should therefore regard the separate - universe condition as a restriction on the size rather than the mass of the overdense region .",
