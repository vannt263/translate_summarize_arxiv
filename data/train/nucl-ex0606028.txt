    "the structure of the inclusive @xmath0 spectrum from relativistic nuclear collisions is affected by several aspects of collision dynamics and by the final - state hadronization process . comparisons of p - p , d - au and au - au @xmath0 spectra at rhic suggest that a form of color - deconfined matter has been created in au - au collisions  @xcite .",
    "particle production mechanisms which could determine spectrum structure include soft parton scattering followed by longitudinal or ` string ' fragmentation  @xcite and hard parton scattering followed by transverse fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms could be significant .",
    "the structure of the @xmath0 spectrum at some achievable level of precision may therefore be complex .",

    "? how does it interact with thermal or ` soft ' particle production ?",
    "is there an ` intermediate ' @xmath0 region  @xcite with its own unique production mechanisms ?",
    "those issues remain unresolved after much theoretical speculation and experimental measurement and provide a context for the present analysis applied to high - statistics @xmath0 spectra from ten multiplicity classes of p - p collisions .",
    "the multiplicity dependence offers new access to underlying particle production mechanisms .",

    "function  @xcite , a form suggested by measured jet systematics and perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) expectations . at larger @xmath0 the spectrum",
    "is expected to tend asymptotically to the power - law form @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the strict power - law form is then generalized to the function @xmath5 , having the expected pqcd dependence at larger @xmath0 but transitioning to an approximate maxwell - boltzmann form at smaller @xmath0 , consistent with expectations for thermal particle production . although the power - law function has been previously applied to p - p data with apparently good fit quality ( @xmath6 within expected limits ) it has not been tested with the precision of recently - acquired rhic p - p data .",
    "one can question the validity of its underlying assumptions .",
    "for instance , why should a single model function adequately describe spectra which may represent a mixture of several particle production mechanisms ?",
    "alternatively , a model function can be formulated in terms of the _ two - component _ model of nuclear collisions  @xcite , which identifies ` soft ' p - p collisions with no hard parton scatter and ` semi - hard ' collisions with at least one significant parton scatter ( _ i.e. , _ producing distinguishable hadron fragments ) . according to the two - component model",
    "the minimum - bias distribution on event multiplicity @xmath7 can be decomposed into separate negative binomial distributions ( nbd ) identified with soft and semi - hard event types .",
    "we then expect the _ fraction _ of events with a hard parton collision to increase monotonically with selected event multiplicity @xmath7 .",
    "variation of @xmath0 spectra with @xmath7 could then provide a basis for isolating soft and hard ( and possibly other ) components of inclusive spectra on a statistical basis , where the hard spectrum component refers to the fragment @xmath0 spectrum for hard - scattered partons , and the soft component is the @xmath0 spectrum for ` soft ' particle production .    in this analysis",
    "we first test the ability of the conventional power - law model function to represent the data .",
    "we then reconsider the data with no _ a priori _ assumptions .",

    "( [ 2compalg ] ) and sec .  [ discussion ] ) and then to associate the model elements with possible particle production mechanisms .",
    "we adopt two new analysis techniques : 1 ) we introduce transverse rapidity @xmath3  @xcite as an alternative to @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath3 has the advantage that spectrum structure associated with hard parton scattering and fragmentation is _ more uniformly represented _ on a logarithmic variable : @xmath3 corresponds to variable @xmath8 conventionally used to describe parton fragmentation functions in elementary collisions  @xcite . a simple description of soft particle production is not compromised by the choice of transverse rapidity .",
    "2 ) we introduce the running integral of the @xmath3 spectrum , which substantially reduces statistical fluctuations relative to significant structure and therefore improves the precision of the analysis .    in this paper",
    "we present high - statistics @xmath0 spectra for ten multiplicity classes from p - p collisions at @xmath1 gev .",
    "we use the conventional power - law model function to fit those spectra and assess the quality of that description .",
    "we then construct running integrals of the spectra on @xmath3 and define a reference function common to all @xmath7 values and based on the lvy distribution .",
    "we use that reference to extract difference spectra which contain the @xmath7-dependent parts of the spectra in a more differential form .",
    "we find that the difference spectra have a simple structure : the major component is well - described by a gaussian distribution with fixed shape and with amplitude ( relative to the reference ) linearly proportional to the particle multiplicity . to simplify presentation",
