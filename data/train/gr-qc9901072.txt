    "as we approach the next millennium there is a focussed worldwide effort to construct devices that will enable the first undisputed detection of gravitational waves . a network of large - scale ground - based laser - interferometer detectors ( ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama300 ) is under construction , while the sensitivity of the several resonant mass detectors that are already in operation continues to be improved . at the present time it seems likely that the gravitational - wave window to the universe will be opened within the next five to ten years , and that gravitational - wave astronomy will finally become a reality .",
    "an integral part in this effort is played by theoretical modelling of the expected sources .",
    "theorists are presently racking their brains to think of various sources of gravitational waves that may be observable once the new ultrasensitive detectors operate at their optimum level , and of any piece of information one may be able to extract from such observations .",
    "one of the most challenging goals that can ( at least , in principle ) be achieved via gravitational - wave detection is the determination of the equation of state of matter at supranuclear densities .",
    "we have recently argued that observed gravitational waves from the various nonradial pulsation modes of a neutron star can be used to infer both the mass and the radius of the star with surprisingly good accuracy , and thus put useful constraints on the equation of state @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was , however , based on an `` ideal '' detection situation that ignored the various uncertainties associated with the analysis of a noisy data - stream . in the present paper we analyze thoroughly this idea by incorporating all possible statistical errors that might arise in estimating the parameters associated with the neutron star equation of state .",
    "the spectrum of a pulsating relativistic star is known to be tremendously rich , but most of the associated pulsation modes are of little relevance for gravitational - wave detection . from the gravitational - wave point of view",
    "one would expect the most important modes to be the fundamental ( @xmath0 ) mode of fluid oscillation , the first few pressure ( @xmath1 ) modes and the first gravitational - wave ( @xmath2 ) modes @xcite .",
    "for details on the theory of relativistic stellar pulsation we refer the reader to a recent review article by one of us @xcite .",
    "that the bulk of the energy from an oscillating neutron star is , indeed , radiated through these modes has been demonstrated by numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , two of us @xcite provided data for the relevant pulsation modes of several stellar models for each of twelve proposed realistic equations of state , thus extending earlier results of lindblom and detweiler .",
    "this data was then used to obtain empirical relations between the observables ( frequency and damping time ) of the @xmath0- and the @xmath2-modes and the stellar parameters ( mass and radius ) .",
    "it was shown that these relations could be used to infer both the radius and the mass of the star ( typically with an error smaller than 10% ) , i.e. , to take the fingerprints of the star .",
    "it was also pointed out that , since no general empirical relations could be inferred for the @xmath1-modes , they could prove important for deducing the actual equation of state once the radius and the mass of the star is known .",
    "the empirical relations , including the relevant statistical errors , are listed in appendix  1 .",
    "the proposed strategy can potentially be of great importance to gravitational - wave astronomy , since most stars are expected to oscillate nonradially .",
    "the evidence for this is compelling : many @xmath1-modes ( as well as possible @xmath3-modes and @xmath4-modes ) have been observed in the sun and there are strong indications that similar modes are excited also in more distant stars . in principle",
    ", one would expect the modes of a star to be excited in any dynamical scenario that leads to significant asymmetries . still",
    ", one can only hope to observe gravitational waves from the most compact stars .",
    "hence , our attention is restricted to neutron stars ( or possible strange stars @xcite , if they exist ) .",
    "furthermore , to lead to detectable gravitational waves the modes must be excited to quite large amplitudes , which means that only the most violent processes are of interest .",
    "there are several scenarios in which the various pulsation modes may be excited to an interesting level : ( 1 ) a supernova explosion is expected to form a wildly pulsating neutron star that emits gravitational waves .",
    "the current estimates for the energy radiated as gravitational waves from supernovae is rather pessimistic , suggesting a total release of the equivalent to @xmath5 , or so .",
    "however , this may be a serious underestimate if the gravitational collapse in which the neutron star is formed is strongly non - spherical .",
    "optimistic estimates suggest that as much as @xmath6 may be released in extreme events .",
    "( 2 ) another potential excitation mechanism for stellar pulsation is a starquake , e.g. , associated with a pulsar glitch .",
    "the typical energy released in this process may be of the order of the maximum mechanical energy that can be stored in the crust , estimated to be at the level of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is also an interesting possibility considering the recent conclusion that the soft - gamma repeaters are likely to be so - called magnetars , neutron stars with extreme magnetic fields @xcite , that undergo frequent starquakes .",
    "it seems very likely that some pulsation modes are excited by the rather dramatic events that lead to the most energetic bursts seen from these systems .",
    "indeed , duncan has recently argued that toriodal modes in the crust should be excited .",
    "if modes are excited in these systems , an indication of the energy released in the most powerful bursts is the @xmath8 estimated for the march 5 1979 burst in sgr  0526 - 66 .",
    "the maximum energy should certainly not exceed the total supply in the magnetic field @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the possibility that a burst from a soft gamma - ray repeater may have a gravitational - wave analogue is very exciting .",
    "( 3 ) the coalescence of two neutron stars at the end of binary inspiral may form a pulsating remnant .",
    "it is , of course , most likely , that a black hole is formed when two neutron stars coalesce , but even in that case the eventual collapse may be halted long enough ( many dynamical timescales ) that several oscillation modes could potentially be identified @xcite .",
    "also , stellar oscillations can be excited by the tidal fields of the two stars during the inspiral phase that preceeds the merger @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the star may undergo a dramatic phase - transition that leads to a mini - collapse .",
    "this would be the result of a sudden softening of the equation of state ( for example , associated with the formation of a condensate consisting of pions or kaons ) .",
    "a phase - transition could lead to a sudden contraction during which a considerable part of the stars gravitational binding energy would be released , and it seems inevitable that part of this energy would be channeled into pulsations of the remnant .",
    "large amounts of energy that could be released in the most extreme of these scenarios : a contraction of ( say ) 10% can easily lead to the release of @xmath6 .",
    "transformation of a neutron star into a strange star is likely to induce pulsations in a similar fashion .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the bulk of the total energy of the oscillation is released through a few of the stars quadrupole pulsation modes in all these scenarios .",
    "we will assume that this is the case and assess the likelihood that the associated gravitational waves will be detected .",
    "having done this we discuss the inverse problem , and investigate how accurately the neutron star parameters can be inferred from the gravitational wave data .    before we proceed with our main analysis",
    "it is worthwhile making one further comment . in this study",
    "we neglect the effects of rotation on the pulsation modes .",
    "this is not because rotation plays an insignificant role . on the contrary",
    ", we expect rotation to be highly relevant in many cases .",
    "the recent discovery that the so - called @xmath4-modes may be unstable @xcite and lead to rapid spin down of a young neutron star that is born rapidly rotating @xcite , highlights the fact that it is not sufficient to consider only non - rotating stars .",
    "still , as far as most pulsation modes are concerned , one would expect rotation to have a significant effect only for neutron stars with very short period , and the present study may well be reasonable for stars with periods longer than , say , 20 ms .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that neutron stars are typically born slowly rotating @xcite .",
    "if that is the typical case , then our results could be relevant for most newly born neutron stars .",
    "a more pragmatic reason for not including rotation in the present study is that detailed data for modes of rotating neutron stars is not yet available .",
    "once such data has been computed the present study should be extended to incorporate rotational effects .",
    "having pointed out this caveat , we are prepared to proceed with the discussion of the present results .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we basically repeat the analysis of finn , in a slightly different form in order to compute the measurement errors of frequency and damping time of a gravitational wave that is emitted from a pulsating neutron star , and extend this analysis , so as to compute the accuracy by which one can estimate various parameters of the star . in section 3",
    "we transform our results into a form that shows clearly how plausible it is to determine the equation of state of a neutron star by analyzing the gravitational wave data . in section 4",
    "we discuss how detection of mode signals can be used to reveal the nuclear equation of state .",
    "section 5 is a brief discussion of how accurately one can expect to be able to locate the source in the sky .",
    "the final section presents our conclusions .",
    "appendix  1 contains empirical relations for oscillation frequency and damping rate of the @xmath0 and @xmath2-modes in terms of the stellar parameters ( mass and radius ) , deduced from twelve realistic equations of state @xcite .",
    "appendix  2 lists the elements of the fisher and covariance matrices used in the statistical analysis of the mode - signals .",
    "suppose that one tries to detect the gravitational waves associated with the stellar pulsation modes that are excited when ( say ) a neutron star forms after a supernova explosion .",
    "since all modes are relatively short lived , the detection situation is similar to that for a perturbed rotating black hole @xcite . for each individual mode",
    "the signal is expected to have the following form : @xmath10 & for $ t > t$. \\cr } \\label{template}\\ ] ] here , @xmath11 is the initial amplitude of the signal , @xmath12 is its arrival time , and @xmath0 and @xmath13 are the frequency and damping time of the oscillation , respectively . since the violent formation of a neutron star is a very complicated event , the above form of the waves becomes realistic only at the late stages when the remnant is settling down and its pulsations can be accurately described as a superposition of the various modes , either fluid or spacetime ones , that have been excited . at earlier times ( @xmath14 )",
    "the waves are expected to have a random character that is completely uncorrelated with the intrinsic noise of an earth - bound detector .",
    "this partly justifies our simplification of setting the waveform equal to zero for @xmath14 .",
    "the energy flux @xmath15 carried by any weak gravitational wave @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the speed of light and @xmath19 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "thus , when gravitational waves emitted from a pulsating neutron star hit such a detector on earth , their initial amplitude will be @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy released through the mode and @xmath4 is the distance between detector and source .",
    "again , @xmath0 is the frequency of gravitational waves and @xmath13 is the damping time : the rate at which the amplitude of the mode decays as energy is carried away from the star .    in order to reveal this kind of signal from the noisy output of a detector one could use templates of the same form as the expected signal ( so called matched filtering ) . following the analysis of echeverria the signal - to - noise ratio is found to be @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the quality factor of the oscillation , and @xmath24 the spectral density of the detector ( assumed to be constant over the bandwidth of the signal ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ snr ] ) , we used the following definition for the scalar product between two functions : @xmath25 to compute the accuracy by which the parameters of the signal can be determined , we first define the dimensionless parameters @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the true values of the four quantities @xmath29 .",
    "these new parameters are simply relative deviations of the measured quantities from their true values .",
    "one can then construct the fisher information matrix @xmath30 and by inverting it , obtain all possible information about the measurement accuracy of each parameter of the signal , and the correlations between the errors of the parameters .",
    "the components of the symmetric fisher matrix , which is defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the parameters of the signal , are listed in appendix  2 .",
    "the inverse of the fisher matrix , @xmath33 , the so - called covariance matrix , is the most important quantity from the experimental point of view .",
    "its components , that are directly related with the measurement errors of the parameters , are also listed in appendix  2 .",
    "the purpose of the present analysis is to try to identify the nuclear equation of state from supposedly detected mode data .",
    "the relevant parameters for this analysis are the frequency @xmath0 and damping time @xmath13 .",
    "hence , we only need @xmath34 and @xmath35 the squares of the relative errors of @xmath0 and @xmath13 respectively from appendix  2",
    ". we will also discuss the possibility that the signal will be seen by several detectors .",
    "if that is the case , we can use the time of arrival @xmath12 to locate the position of the source in the sky . for this discussion",
    "we need @xmath36 , see section  5 .",
    "the estimated errors of the actual measurements should be taken into account along with the statistical errors in our empirical relations ( cf .",
    "appendix  a ) in order to compute the parameters of the pulsating star . the law of error propagation will be employed to estimate the errors of the parameters of the star : when one tries to estimate the value of a quantity @xmath37 which is given as a function of other quantities @xmath38 that can be measured directly , the error that should be attributed to the former one is given by @xmath39 ^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\label{errorpropagation}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the measurement error of the quantity @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the correlation between the errors of @xmath41 and @xmath43 . in section  4",
    "we will use the measured values of the frequencies of the @xmath0 and the first @xmath1-mode ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) to obtain information about the parameters of the star .",
    "since these are independent quantities ( they are measured separately by different templates ) , the second sum of the above law will not be present in our calculations .",
    "the magnitude of the estimated errors of neutron star parameters will determine the efficiency of the method and our chance to achieve our final goal , the determination of the equation of state of a neutron star .",
    "two separate questions must be addressed in any discussion of gravitational - wave detection .",
    "the first one concerns identifying a weak signal in a noisy detector , thus establishing the presence of a gravitational wave in the data .",
    "the second question regards extracting the detailed parameters of the signal , e.g. , the frequency and e - folding time of a pulsation mode . to address either of these issues",
    "we need an estimate of the spectral noise density @xmath24 of the detector .",
    "the few pulsation modes of a neutron star that may be detectable through the associated gravitational waves all have rather high frequencies ; typically of the order of several khz . to illustrate this",
    "we show the mode - frequencies for all models considered by andersson and kokkotas as a function of the stellar mass in figure  [ fig1 ] . from this figure",
    "we immediately see that a detector must be sensitive to frequencies of the order of 8 - 12 khz and above to observe most @xmath2-modes . of course , it is also clear that some equations of state yield @xmath2-modes at somewhat lower frequencies .",
    "for example , for massive neutron stars with @xmath46 ( stiff eos ) , as have been suggested for low - mass x - ray binaries , the @xmath2-mode frequency could be as low as 6  khz ( see also recent results for the axial @xmath2-modes by benhar et al ) .",
    "the @xmath1-modes lie mainly in the range 4 - 8 khz , while all @xmath0-modes have frequencies lower than 4 khz .",
    "this means that the mode - signals we consider lie in the regime where an interferometric detector is severely limited by the photon shot noise .",
    "for this reason a detection strategy based on resonant detectors ( bars , spheres or even networks of small resonant detectors @xcite ) or laser interferometers operating in dual recycling mode seems the most promising .",
    "in fact , the range of mode - frequencies in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] should motivate detailed studies of the prospects for construction dedicated ultrahigh frequency detectors . in the following",
    "we will compare three different detectors : the initial and advanced ligo interferometers , for which @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50  hz for the initial configuration , and @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53  hz respectively , for the advanced configuration @xcite .",
    "we also consider an `` ideal '' detector that is tuned to the frequency of the mode and has sensitivity of the order of @xmath54 hz@xmath55 ( this is the sensitivity goal of detectors under construction ) .",
    "it should be noted that the advanced ligo estimates are roughly valid also for spherical detectors such as tiga , cf .",
    "harry , stevenson and paik .",
    "the detectability of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-modes for different detectors can be assessed from ( [ snr ] ) .",
    "the main problem in doing this is the lack of realistic simulations providing information about the level of excitation of various modes in an astrophysical situation .",
    "still , given the frequency and damping rate of a specific mode we can ask what amount of energy must be channeled through the mode in order to be detectable by a given detector . we immediately find that detection of pulsating neutron stars from outside our own galaxy is very unlikely .",
    "let us consider a `` typical '' stellar model for which the @xmath0-mode has parameters @xmath56  khz and @xmath57  s. this corresponds to a @xmath58 neutron star according to the bethe - johnson equation of state , cf .",
    "table  3 of andersson and kokkotas .",
    "for this example we find that the @xmath0-mode in the virgo cluster ( at 15 mpc ) must carry an energy equivalent to more than @xmath59 to lead to a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 in our ideal detector .",
    "given that the total energy estimated to be radiated as gravitational waves in a supernova is at the level of @xmath60 , we can not realistically expect to observe mode - signals from far beyond our own galaxy .",
    "this means that the number of detectable events may be rather low .",
    "certainly , one would not expect to see a supernova in our galaxy more often than once every thirty years , or so .",
    "still , there are a large number of neutron stars in our galaxy , all of which may be be involved in dramatic events ( see the introduction for some possibilities ) that lead to the excitation of pulsation modes .",
    "the energies required to make each mode detectable ( with a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 ) from a source at the center of our galaxy ( at 10 kpc ) are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . in the table",
    "we have used the data for the `` typical '' stellar model , for which the characteristics of the @xmath0-mode were given above , @xmath61  khz and @xmath62  s , and @xmath63  khz and @xmath64  ms .",
    "this data indicates that , even though the event that excites the modes must be violent , the energy required to make each mode detectable is not at all unrealistic .",
    "in fact , the energy levels required for both the @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes are such that detection of violent events in the life of a neutron star should be possible , given the advanced ligo detectors ( or alternatively spheres with the sensitivity proposed for tiga ) .",
    "on the other hand , detection of @xmath2-modes with the broad band configuration of ligo seems unlikely .",
    "detection of these modes , which would correspond to observing a uniquely relativistic phenomenon , requires dedicated high frequency detectors operating in the frequency range above 6 khz .",
    "still , we believe that the data in table  [ tab1 ] illustrates that neutron star pulsation modes may well be detectable from within our galaxy , and that the first detection may in fact come as soon as the first generation of ligo detectors come on line .",
    ".the estimated energy ( in units of @xmath65 ) required in each mode in order to lead to a detection with signal - to - noise ratio of 10 from a pulsating neutron star at the center of our galaxy ( 10 kpc ) . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab3 ]",
    "in the previous section we discussed issues regarding the detectability of a mode - signal , and the accuracy with which the parameters of the mode could be inferred from noisy gravitational wave data .",
    "let us now assume that we have detected the mode and extracted the relevant parameters .",
    "we then naturally want to constrain the supranuclear equation of state by deducing the mass and the radius of the star ( or combinations of them ) . in principle",
    ", the mass and the radius can be deduced from any two observables , cf . , table  2 of andersson and kokkotas . in the absence of detector noise ,",
    "several combinations look promising , but in reality only few combinations are likely to be useful .",
    "consider the following example : we could in principle deduce the mass and the radius from a detected @xmath0-mode ( assuming that we have extracted both its frequency and damping rate ) .",
    "however , as can be seen from table  [ tab2 ] , the estimated relative error in frequency is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the relative error in damping time . hence , if these two measurements are to be used to determine the mass and the radius of the pulsating star one must keep in mind that the measurement of frequency is far more accurate than the measurement of damping time . and it is clear that by combining @xmath44 with @xmath66 we will only get accurate estimates for @xmath67 and @xmath68 if the energy in the mode is substantial .",
    "the same is true for the combination @xmath45 and @xmath69 , as well as any combination involving the @xmath2-mode data .",
    "still , we should not discard the possibility that there will be unique events for which @xmath2-modes carry the bulk of the energy , as for example the scattering of @xcite or the infall of a smaller mass on neutron stars @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the strategy proposed by andersson and kokkotas will be useful .    from the data in tables  [ tab1][tab3 ]",
    ", it seems natural to use the @xmath1-mode in any scheme for deducing the stellar parameters .",
    "but , as we have already mentioned , there does not exist a `` nice '' relation between frequency and stellar parameters for the @xmath1-mode , that is independent of the equation of state .",
    "still , the strategy that would seem the most promising on the basis of the present results is based on using the frequencies of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes .",
    "a possible method is based on the following steps : the first step is to invert the empirical relation for the @xmath0-mode frequency , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , in order to transform the measurement of @xmath44 to an estimate of the mean density of the star .",
    "let us define a parameter @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in order to simplify the notation .",
    "then , once @xmath44 has been measured @xmath73 can be computed from @xmath74 with a corresponding relative error @xmath75^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\label{errorx}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is expressed in khz .",
    "the first of the three terms in the square root comes , obviously , from the measurement error of @xmath44 ( the extra complicating factor , related with the @xmath76 of the @xmath0-mode , that arises there when one tries to express the result with respect to the signal - to - noise , has been simplified to unity since the @xmath76 of the @xmath0-mode is generally a large number ) .",
    "the other two terms arise from dispersion of the data for the various equation of state . for a typical @xmath0-mode frequency of 2  khz , and",
    "damping time 0.2  s the relative error in @xmath73 is @xmath77 ( assuming @xmath78 ) . actually , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ errorx ] ) is negligible and could be omitted .",
    "therefore @xmath79 here , we need not worry about the sign of the factor @xmath80 ; it is always positive since @xmath81 for every stellar model in the dataset , see figure  [ fig1 ] here , or figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "then , by measuring the frequency of the first @xmath1-mode which is expected to carry roughly as much energy as the @xmath0-mode , see allen et al , one could place an error box on a diagram of @xmath45 vs. @xmath73 , where all theoretical models for the equation of state are drawn .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this way we can identify the most likely equation of state . detecting gravitational waves from pulsating neutron stars ensures quite accurate measurements of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so the error box in figure  [ fig3 ] is remarkably small .",
    "hence , this method can easily distinguish between the different equations of state in our dataset .",
    "in fact , what makes this method so efficient is the fact that different equations of state are described by quite distinct curves in an @xmath82 diagram .",
    "finally , we would like to infer the mass and radius of the neutron star . to do this we can use the data in figure  [ fig4 ] , which gives the connection between the @xmath1-mode frequencies of the different equations of state and the stellar compactness . from this diagram",
    ", we can immediately use the detected @xmath45 to infer the compactness of the star , once the right equation of state has been identified .",
    "having estimated both the average density and the compactness , it is an elementary calculation to obtain the mass and the radius of the star .    at this point",
    "it is natural to ask the following question : what if the true equation of state is not close to one of the present models",
    "? this may well be the case .",
    "after all , our understanding of the state of nuclear matter at supranuclear densities still awaits observational testing .",
    "should the equation of state be markedly different from the ones in our sample we will get an error box which does not lie close to any of the equations of state in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "should one then want to estimate the stellar parameters , one could construct a sequence of polytropes ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) for various values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see for example the graphs in @xcite ) .",
    "the appropriate combination of these free parameters will bring the corresponding equation of state within our error box .",
    "then , one could use figure  [ fig4 ] and read off the `` correct '' compactness of the star ( @xmath87 ) and from this compute its radius and mass .",
    "as with other kinds of gravitational - wave sources , a network of at least three detectors is needed to pinpoint the location of the source in the sky . the difference in arrival time for the three detectors could be used to determine the position of the source . the higher the accuracy in measuring the time of arrival at each detector",
    ", the more precise will be the positioning of the source .",
    "two remote detectors , at a distance @xmath88 apart from each other will receive the signal with a temporal difference of @xmath89 where @xmath18 is the speed of light , and @xmath90 is the angle between the line joining the two detectors and the line of sight of the source .",
    "therefore , the accuracy by which this angle can be measured is @xmath91 the @xmath92 arises from the measurement errors of the two times of arrival . if one assumes an ` l ' shaped network of 3 detectors with arm length of @xmath93  km , eqs .",
    "( [ relerrortime ] ) and ( [ deltatheta ] ) lead to an error box on the sky with angular sides of @xmath94 , at most ( for specific areas of the sky , and large signal - to - noise ratios the angular sizes could be much smaller ) .",
    "this is quite interesting since one could then correlate the detection of gravitational waves with radio- , x - ray or gamma - ray observations directed on that specific corner of the sky .",
    "in this paper we have extended previous studies of the detectability of gravitational waves from pulsating neutron stars to include the statistical errors associated with an analysis of a weak signal in a noisy data stream .",
    "we have shown that the generation of detectors that is presently under construction may well be able to observe such sources from within our own galaxy .",
    "detections from distant galaxies seem unlikely , unless a sizeable amount of energy ( of the order of @xmath95 ) is released through the pulsation modes .",
    "this means that we expect the event rate to be rather low .",
    "one would certainly not expect to see more than perhaps three neutron stars being born in supernovae per century in our galaxy .",
    "of course , other unique events in a neutron stars life , like starquakes and phase - transitions , may lead to relevant signals .",
    "perhaps the most interesting possibility is the possible association between gravitational waves from pulsation modes and gamma rays from the soft - gamma repeaters ( the magnetars ) .",
    "the number of such events is very hard to estimate at the present time . given the many uncertainties in the available models of all these scenarios , we certainly can not rule out the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from pulsations in neutron stars .",
    "however , and this is an important point , the chances of detecting pulsating neutron stars would be much enhanced if one could construct dedicated high - frequency gravitational - wave detectors sensitive in the range 5 - 10  khz .",
    "this provides a serious challenge to experimenters , but that the pay - off of a successful detection of oscillating neutron stars would be great is clear from our present analysis of the inverse problem .",
    "we have shown that the oscillation frequencies of the fluid @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes can be accurately deduced from detected signals .",
    "other parameters , like the particulars of the gravitational - wave @xmath2 modes will be much more difficult to infer , unless the signal - to - noise ratio of the detection is unexpectedly large .",
    "this means that a previously proposed strategy for deducing the parameters of the star ( the mass and the radius ) from observations of the @xmath0 and a @xmath2-mode is unlikely to be practical .",
    "however , we show that an equally powerful strategy can be based on detected @xmath0 and @xmath1-modes . given an observation of @xmath0 and @xmath1-mode oscillation frequencies , with the estimated accuracies , we can easily rule out many proposed equations of state .",
    "in other words , we have proposed a gravitational - wave `` fingerprint analysis '' for neutron stars holds a lot of promise , and may help us reveal the true equation of state at supranuclear densities once gravitational waves are observed .",

    "in this appendix we list the empirical relations deduced from data for twelve different realistic equations of star .",
    "these relations between the observables ( frequency and damping of the modes ) and the stellar parameters ( mass @xmath67 and radius @xmath68 ) are essentially the same as the ones listed by andersson and kokkotas , but here we also include the relevant statistical errors .",
    "we have constructed empirical relations for both the fundamental mode of fluid pulsation ( the @xmath0-mode ) and the slowest damped of the gravitational wave @xmath2-modes . for the @xmath0-mode , the frequency scales with the mean density of the neutron star according to @xmath96 while the damping time of the @xmath0-mode can be described by @xmath97 \\ ; , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath98 .",
    "the indicated uncertainties are simply the statistical errors that show up if one takes into account all stellar models in the data set , on equal basis . in principle , equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) could be inverted to compute the average density ( @xmath99 ) and compactness ( @xmath87 ) of the star from measured values of @xmath44 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , this procedure proves unreliable since eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is a double - valued function with respect to compactness , and the presence of errors makes it impossible to infer the compactness of the star with reasonable accuracy , even if the characteristics of the waves could be measured with extreme precision .",
    "the @xmath2-modes are pulsations directly associated with spacetime itself .",
    "they have relatively high oscillation frequencies ( 6 - 14 khz for typical neutron stars ) and barely excite any fluid motion .",
    "they are also rapidly damped , with typical lifetime of fraction of a millisecond .",
