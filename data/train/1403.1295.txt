    "in recent years , we faced rapidly growing interest in analysing systems that obey the constraints of impossibility of instant transmission of messages .",
    "the constraints , called _ non - signaling _ , are satisfied by quantum mechanics , hence any limitations they pose are also present in quantum mechanics .",
    "however , in so - called non - signaling theories , there are objects that exhibit behaviour forbidden by quantum mechanics .",
    "one of the basic blocks of non - signaling theories is the so called popescu - rohrlich box ( pr - box ) @xcite  a device that possesses much stronger correlations than those allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "it has a remarkable property of being able to simulate a _ random access code _",
    "( rac ) with the support of only one bit of communication @xcite .",
    "suppose that alice wants to send to bob one of two bits , so that bob has the choice which bit he wants to learn about .",
    "suppose further that the following conditions are met : first , when bob gets perfect knowledge about bit , he must have no knowledge about the other bit , second , no communication from bob to alice is allowed , i.e. , bob should not tell alice which bit he wants to learn , as well as after the execution of the protocol alice should still not know which bit he learned .",
    "such a scenario is called random access code @xcite .",
    "this task is impossible , when alice and bob share either classical or quantum states .",
    "however , if alice and bob share the pr - box , they can implement it by sending just _",
    "one _ bit .",
    "this peculiar feature was used to formulate the principle of _ information causality _ @xcite . in this context in @xcite the notion of a _ racbox _ was introduced .",
    "it is a box which can implement a random access code with the support of one bit of communication .",
    "it was shown that any non - singaling racbox is equivalent to pr - box .",
    "a natural question is whether one can have a quantum analogue of this phenomenon .",
    "namely , we consider _ quantum random access code _",
    ", where alice has two qubits , and bob wants to learn about the qubit of his choice . again ,",
    "communication from bob to alice is not allowed , and bob should not learn about the other qubit .",
    "let us emphasize that this is a different concept from quantum random access code introduced in @xcite and further considered in @xcite where qubits are used to simulate the standard random access code  the one with classical inputs and outputs  by encoding input classical bits into the quantum system , and then decoding the chosen classical bit by measurement . in our case ,",
    "both inputs and outputs of the quantum random access code are quantum states .",
    "one can now ask , whether such functionality can be achieved by means of a _ quantum non - signaling box _ , @xcite i.e. , the non - signaling box that accepts qubits as inputs .",
    "such a box can be viewed as a quantum channel , with two inputs and two outputs , with property , that the statistics of the output at one site do not depend on the input at the other site . in this paper",
    ", we propose a quantum non - signaling box which , if supported by two bits of classical communication , implements the above quantum version of rac .",
    "the box is built out of two pr - boxes and two maximally entangled quantum states .",
    "we also prove that two bits of communication are necessary , by using analogy with quantum teleportation .",
    "we then show , that no quantum non - signaling box can give rise to a fully quantum rac .",
    "namely , if bob inputs _ superposition _ of decisions on which qubit he wants to learn about , the output must be a mixture of states of alice s qubits rather than superposition .",
    "this resembles the question of whether quantum computer can be fully quantum asked in @xcite , where the superposition of halt times was impossible .",
    "in this section we describe the standard random access code , and a closely related object called `` racbox '' .",
    "namely , suppose that alice has two bits @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and bob wants to learn one of them .",
    "we want bob to have a choice , which bit he would like to learn , but if he learns one of the bits , then the other should be lost .",
    "moreover at any time alice can not know bob s choice . as already mentioned in introduction , such a task is called random access code",
    ".    there does not exist classical or quantum communication protocol , that can perform this task , which is easy to see at least in classical case .",
    "indeed , the only thing alice can do , so that bob can read the bit of his choice , is to send both bits .",
    "but in such case the condition that he should not learn the other bit is not met .",
    "let us also note , that if we weaken the definition of random access code and will not assume , that bob can not learn two bits , then such a weaker version of random access code needs two bits of classical communication .",
    "the situation changes if alice and bob share so called pr - box .",
    "pr - box is a bipartite device shared by two distant parties alice and bob .",
    "each of the parties can choose one of two inputs : alice @xmath2 and bob @xmath3 .",
    "the parties have two binary outputs @xmath4 .",
    "the box is defined by a family of joint probability distributions @xmath5 which satisfy p(ab|xy)= \\ { 12 ab = xy , + 0 . .",
    "the pr box can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "on one hand it can be considered as a `` super - quantum '' resource , as it allows for correlations , that can not be obtained from measuring bipartite quantum state . on the other hand , it can be treated as a classical channel , with two remote inputs and two remote outputs .",
    "the channel has a special property : its implementation requires 1 bit of communication , but if it works as a `` black box '' - i.e. if the parties can only use the box through the inputs and outputs , it can not be used for communication - we say it is non - signaling .",
    "now , in @xcite it is shown , that if alice and bob share a pr box , they can implement random access code by means of just one bit of communication . in @xcite a converse question was answered : namely , an object was defined called _",
    "racbox_. it is a box that implements rac if supported by one bit of communication from alice to bob ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : racbox ] ) .",
    "it was then shown that a _",
    "non - sinaling _ racbox is equivalent to pr box .",
    "in this section we define non - signaling quantum random access code box ( qrac - box , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which performs a quantum version of random access code if supplemented with 2 bits of communication .",
    "qrac - box is a bipartite device shared by alice and bob .",
    "alice has a two - qubit input and a two - bit classical output ( later we show that this is the smallest possible size of alice s classical output .",
    "bob has two inputs : a one - qubit input and a two - bit classical input .",
    "he also has a one - qubit output ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qrac ] ) .",
    "we assume that the device obeys quantum mechanical laws , i.e. , it is trace preserving completely positive map .",
    "we further assume that device can not signal from one party to the other party , i.e. , one party s output can not depend on the other party s input .",
    "now , such a device will be called qrac - box , if it possesses the following property .",
    "suppose that alice inputs the first qubit in a state @xmath6 and the second qubit in a state @xmath7 .",
    "she then obtains @xmath8 as her output .",
    "when bob s classical input @xmath9 is equal to alice s classical output @xmath8 and his input qubit is in a state @xmath10 then we require that he obtains a state @xmath11 as his output . on the other hand , when bob s input @xmath9 is equal to alice s output @xmath8 and his input qubit is in a state @xmath12 , then we require that he obtains a state @xmath13 as his output . as a result ,",
    "if alice sends her output to bob , then bob can obtain alice s qubit of his choice , by simply inputing @xmath14 .",
    "let us note , that from the fact that device is non - signaling , i.e. , in particular , alice s output does not depend on bob s input , the above definition of qrac - box is consistent , i.e. , the classical output of alice can be fed as bob s input without causing a contradiction .",
    "if , on the contrary , the output of alice would depend on input of bob , then it might happen that whenever bob wants to input @xmath14 , then this changed output of alice , so that it were no longer @xmath8 and we would obtain a contradiction , i.e. , bob would not be able to input alice s output .    finally , let us note , that the above properties of qrac - box imply , that the box obtained from feeding alice s classical input as bob s classical input is a quantum channel too ( which may not be no - signaling anymore ) with three inputs , and one output , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] .",
    "we shall call the channel qrac .",
    "it is a sum of subchannels ( which are completely positive trace non - increasing maps ) labeled by alice s outputs = _ a_a .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] where by @xmath15 we denote the channel representing qrac .",
    "as mentioned above , we assumed that qrac - box obeys the laws of quantum mechanics , i.e. , it is a quantum channel ( with several inputs and outputs ) of some particular features .",
    "a possible way to implement such a channel in lab is to send inputs from alice and bob to a joint place , perform the quantum operation , e.g. , by means of a circuit composed of quantum gates ( nowadays more and more complicated circuits are possible to implement in labs ) , and resend the outputs of the channel back to alice and bob . in such a scenario , to implement the channel , quantum communication is required .",
    "however , from the point of view of alice and bob , our channel is a black box .",
    "hence , it can not be used to signal from alice to bob and vice versa .",
    "thus the situation is analogous to the case of the pr box - the latter is a classical channel , and one can implement it by means of classical communication , yet considered as a black box , it can not be used itself to perform communication .",
    "one can also consider another way of implementing such channels through pre- and post - selection as proposed in @xcite and realised experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the two ways , are strictly connected .",
    "since the channel requires communication to implement it , if one wants to implement it without communication , one needs to consider some pre- or post - selection ( which is a hidden form of communication ) .",
    "let us suppose that instead of preparing his qubit in a state @xmath10 or @xmath12 and decoding the first or the second of alice s qubits bob prepares his qubit in a state @xmath16 .",
    "what will his output state be when his classical input is equal to alice s output ?",
    "will he obtain a superposition of states @xmath11 and @xmath13 ?",
    "below we answer these questions .",
    "first we will show that the channel qrac defined in the previous section produces a mixture of those states , rather than superposition .",
    "then we will argue , that each of subchannels @xmath17 also produces such a mixture ( now subnormalized ) .",
    "consider then @xmath15 of eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] .",
    "we extend this trace preserving completely positive map to unitary operation @xmath18 acting on a system and environment .",
    "let us check how it acts when bob prepares his qubit in a state @xmath10 and @xmath12 and his input @xmath9 is equal to alice s output @xmath8 .",
    "we have & & u(|_a|_a|0_r|_e)=|_b|^(0)_are + & & u(|_a||_a|1_r|_e)=|_b|^(1)_are where we renamed alice s first input register as bob s output register , @xmath19 is the initial state of the environment while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the final states of alice s second register , bob s input register @xmath22 and environment .",
    "let us note that the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are orthogonal .",
    "hence either @xmath25 is orthogonal to @xmath26 , or @xmath20 is orthogonal to @xmath21 .",
    "since for all @xmath25 non - orthogonal to @xmath26 , the state @xmath20 is orthogonal to @xmath21 , then by continuity for @xmath25 orthogonal to @xmath26 the state @xmath20 has to be orthogonal to @xmath21 as well . when bob prepares his qubit in a state @xmath27 then by linearity we have @xmath28 tracing out alice s second register , bob s input register and environment and using orthogonality of states @xmath20 and @xmath21 we obtain that bob s output state is _ b=||^2||_b+||^2||_b .",
    "[ eq : mixture ] we see that bob obtains a mixture rather than a superposition of states @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "now , consider the subchannels @xmath17 , and suppose , by contradiction , that some of them produces a state which is not equal to such mixture .",
    "let us denote outputs by @xmath29 .",
    "one then easily sees , that there exist unitaries @xmath30 such that _ a u_a _ b^a u_a^= ||^2||_b+||^2||_b [ eq : non_mixture ] thus , we consider qrac - box with the above subchannels @xmath17 , and we will construct a new qrac - box as follows : bob while inputting @xmath9 will apply transformation @xmath31 to his output .",
    "one checks that it defines a valid qrac - box , resulting in subchannels @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , due to the resulting qrac given by @xmath34 will produce a state which is not a mixture .",
    "however this contradicts to our first result , that qrac resulting from arbitrary qrac - box , necessarily produces mixture .",
    "let us now find lower bound for minimal amount of classical information which alice has to send to bob so that he can retrieve alice s qubit of his choice . in the next section we present a box which achieves this bound .",
    "let us assume that bob prepares his input qubit in a state @xmath10 and tries to obtain alice s first qubit ( similar analysis applies when bob prepares his input qubit in a state @xmath12 and tries to obtain alice s second qubit ) .",
    "we know from the previous section that there is no need to consider the case when bob prepares his qubit in a state @xmath27 as he can simply measure it and depending on a result of the measurement input a state @xmath10 or @xmath12 . in the case when bob prepares his input qubit in a state @xmath10 qrac - box acts just like quantum teleportation .",
    "indeed , if alice sends her classical output to bob and bob uses it as his classical input , then he obtains alice s first qubit . now , since we require that qrac - box is non - signaling , we just need to argue , that if alice and bob have non - signaling resources , then they need at least two bits to perform teleportation .",
    "however , this was already proven in @xcite .",
    "namely it is argued that by combining quantum teleportation with dense coding , one would obtain instantaneous communication , thereby violating causality .",
    "we show how one can simulate qrac - box with two maximally entangled pairs and two pr - boxes .",
    "the protocol is based on quantum teleportation and implementation of classical rac with pr - boxes ( see fig . [",
    "fig : eprpr ] ) .",
    "let us suppose that alice and bob apart from qubits which they input into the box share two pairs of qubits and two pr - boxes .",
    "each pair of qubits is in the maximally entangled state latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    pr - box has two inputs and two outputs ",
    "one input and output is on alice s side and one input and output is on bob s side . when alice and bob input @xmath8 and @xmath9 into the box they obtain outputs @xmath36 and @xmath37 with probability @xmath38 in order to implement qrac alice performs measurement in the bell basis x_a^a_0z_a^a_1|^+_aa ( a_0,a_1 \\{0,1 } ) on the first qubit @xmath39 and her qubit from the first maximally entangled pair and obtains two - bit result @xmath40 .",
    "after the measurement bob s qubit from the first maximally entangled pair is in the state @xmath41 . similarly , alice performs measurement in the bell basis on the second qubit @xmath42and her qubit from the second maximally entangled pair and obtains two - bit result @xmath43 .",
    "now alice inputs @xmath44 into the first pr - box , and @xmath45 into the second pr - box and obtains outputs @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "alice s output bits of the qrac - box will be @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "next alice sends two - bit message @xmath50 to bob .",
    "if bob wants to obtain alice s first qubit ( corresponding to the state of his qubit input @xmath51 ) he inputs @xmath52 both into the first pr - box and into the second pr - box .",
    "he obtains outputs @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "he then calculates @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the last equality in each expression follows from eq .",
    "[ pr - box ] .",
    "finally he applies unitary operation @xmath57 to his qubit from the first maximally entangled pair .",
    "if bob wants to obtain alice s second qubit ( corresponding to state of his qubit input @xmath58 ) he inputs @xmath59 into both the first pr - box and the second pr - box , obtains outputs @xmath53 and @xmath54 , calculates @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( now @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) and applies unitary operation @xmath57 to his qubit from the second maximally entangled pair .",
    "after application of unitary operation the qubit will be in a state equal to the initial state of the first ( second ) of alice s qubits .",
    "bob also discards his qubit from the second ( first ) maximally entangled pair . in a general case when bob prepared his qubit input in a state @xmath27 he first performs a measurement on it in computational basis and then conditioned on the result of the measurement he decodes one of alice s qubits .",
    "let us note , that the constructed box is non - signaling , since it is obtained by local operations on non - signaling resources such as pr boxes and maximally entangled states .",
    "also our construction satisfies the condition that given bob s classical input and alice s classical output the transformation from alice s input quantum state to bob s output quantum state is a trace preserving completely positive map .",
    "indeed , the transformation results from some local quantum operations and classical communication  where communication is used to implement pr boxes",
    ".    we also note , that by applying dense coding , we can change the proposed qrac - box into one that operates solely with qubits , i.e. , instead of alice s two - bit output , and bob s two - bit output , they will have 1 qubit output and input , respectively . in more detail , our",
    "`` qubit - only '' qrac - box will consist of the original qrac - box , supplemented by maximally entangled pair .",
    "the two bits of outputs will be sent by means of this pair .",
    "note that the pair will be treated as a part of the qubit - only qrac - box , and will not be seen by users of the box , who will only see inputs and outputs , now all of them quantum .",
    "thus , we obtain that a quantum random access code can be performed by use of a quantum non - signaling box supplemented by one qubit of communication .",
    "we introduced a non - signaling quantum random access code box  a device which enables bob to obtain one of two of alice s qubits when alice sends bob two bits of classical information .",
    "it is important that bob can choose which qubit he wants to obtain .",
    "we investigated properties of such a box and showed that two bits is minimum amount of classical information which alice has to send to bob , i.e. , if there was less communication , the box must be signaling .",
    "we also showed how the box can be implemented with entanglement and pr - boxes .",
