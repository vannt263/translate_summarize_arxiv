    "<S> its influence on the electronic properties and phase behavior of 5d - electron compounds has not yet been addressed .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most striking manifestations of the electron - phonon interaction is the quantum interference between discrete phonons and the continuum of electron - hole excitations , which leads to asymmetric fano resonances @xcite in the scattering and infrared ( ir ) absorption spectra of solids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the electronic contribution increases the fano resonance may undergo a change from a phonon absorption peak to a pronounced dip corresponding to reduced absorption . </S>",
    "<S> this dramatic behavior is one of the characteristic properties of few - layer graphene where fano resonances have been recently observed and studied in detail @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this elementary solid with tunable electron density has proved to be a model system to develop a microscopic theory which accounts quantitatively for the intensity and asymmetry of the fano resonances @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we provide evidence that conditions favorable for fano interference are met in na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 , the semi - metallic counterpart of mott - insulating na@xmath6ir@xmath0o@xmath1 , one of the best candidates for a three - dimensional spin - liquid state @xcite . in both na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 and na@xmath6ir@xmath0o@xmath1 , </S>",

    "<S> based on fully relativistic electronic - structure calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) , we attribute this unusual behavior to rashba - type ir 5d @xmath4 bands intersecting near the fermi level ( resembling the dirac cone in graphene ) . </S>",

    "<S> we report a spectroscopic ellipsometry study of na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 over a wide range of temperatures ( 8 to 300k ) and photon energies extending from the far infrared ( ir ) into the visible , from 15mev to 2ev . in the frequency range 15mev to 1ev </S>",

    "<S> following the wyckoff positions of the 56 atoms and their site symmetries in the @xmath9 unit cell of na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 one would expect 21 triply degenerated @xmath27 ir - active modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only seven of these modes are observed in the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this might be due to insufficient strength and/or weak splitting of the four @xmath28 modes in the assumptive parent @xmath14 pyrochlore structure of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed asymmetric modes are superimposed on a hump - like absorption band centered around 728@xmath26 ( 90mev ) , which grows monotonously in intensity on an almost flat background upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the downturn in @xmath30 below 360@xmath26 ( 45mev ) indicates the free charge carrier response , which is weak and narrow . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](b ) decreases below 360@xmath26 ( 45mev ) with decreasing temperature .    in order to quantitatively parameterize the observed highly asymmetric far - ir modes and the strongly temperature dependent electronic background , we fit a set of generalized lorentzian oscillators @xcite simultaneously to @xmath24 and @xmath38 : @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 the resonance frequency , line width , and asymmetry parameter , respectively , having dimensions of frequency and dimensionless @xmath43 being the contribution to the static permittivity . </S>",
    "<S> the interband transitions at high energies contribute to the background term @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the causality of the dielectric response and kramerskronig requirements over the entire spectral range are maintained by holding the condition of @xmath45 figures  [ fig2](a ) , [ fig2](b ) and table [ tab : param ] summarize the results of our dispersion analysis of the complex dielectric function measured at 8k . </S>",
    "<S> we unambiguously identify seven phonon modes which are highly asymmetric as indicated by the large , negative @xmath46 . in order to maintain the condition of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : glorentz ] ) for one of the low - energy electronic bands , but with the opposite sign compensating the high energy contributions of the phonon modes . </S>",
    "<S> since the sw of broad electronic transitions is large compared to the one of the phonon modes , the asymmetry parameter @xmath48 is relatively small and can not be unequivocally assigned to one or another of the constituent optical bands of the electronic background . in the representative fit shown in figs . [ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) the optical band at 358@xmath26 ( 44mev ) was selected to be asymmetric with @xmath49 , whereas the band at 728@xmath26 ( 90mev ) was taken to be a classical lorentz oscillator with @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> some uncertainty of the phenomenological fitting procedure in the determination of the asymmetry parameter @xmath51 does not affect the parameters of the phonon modes listed in table  [ tab : param ] . </S>",
    "<S> in the vicinity of the resonance frequency the generalized lorentz oscillator in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : glorentz ] ) can be converted into the fano profile resulting from the quantum interference of a discrete state with a continuum : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2](c ) and [ fig2](d ) illustrate exemplarily the fano profiles for the two strongest resonances at @xmath55k . </S>",
    "<S> both resonances are characterized by @xmath56 with an antisymmetric absorption line shape implying comparable phonon and electronic contributions into the fano resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature evolution of @xmath57 is shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     figure  [ fig2](e ) displays the changes occurring in the ir conductivity spectra with increasing temperature , as shown by the difference spectra @xmath59 . by using the dispersion analysis of the dielectric function spectra at different temperatures with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : glorentz ] ) , we determine more accurately the temperature variation of the constituent drude and low - energy inter - band contributions shown by the dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding loss of the associated sw , @xmath60 , with increasing temperature above 8k is detailed in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e ) for the optical band at 728@xmath26 ( 90mev ) , along with the temperature dependence of the integrated sw difference , @xmath61 \\text{d}\\omega$ ] . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the sw in the extrapolation region below 15mev was determined by the procedure based on the kramerskronig consistency check of the experimentally measured @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( see methods in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature - driven loss of the sw , expressed in terms of the effective number of charge carriers @xmath65 , is comparable to the free carrier density evaluated above , and it is not recovered within a high energy scale in excess of 1 ev . in order to quantify the temperature - dependent intensity of the sharp fano resonances we refer to the strength parameter @xmath66 @xcite , which accounts for its both positive and negative contributions to @xmath67 ( approximately equal for @xmath68 ) : @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2](f ) shows the temperature evolution of the fano - strength parameter @xmath66 for the two representative resonances . </S>",
    "<S> it appears clear from our analysis that both the intensity and fano - asymmetry variations of the sharp resonances correlate remarkably well with the strength of the underlying electronic transitions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the sw loss of the phonon resonances stems from the sw loss of the interband transition . </S>",
    "<S> the observed intensity and asymmetry ( table  [ tab : param ] ) of the fano resonances imply a considerable electron - phonon coupling in na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 , given the high bonding ionicity and the large number of ir active modes with evidently large intrinsic dipole moments . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast to the case of graphene , where the static intrinsic dipole is negligible and similar values of the fano parameter @xmath70 @xcite originate mainly from the electronic excitations in the presence of a relatively small electron - phonon coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further evidence for the strong interaction of the phonons with the underlying electronic transitions in na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 is the temperature dependence of the resonance frequency and width of the strongest mode at 461@xmath26 ( dark solid circles and open triangles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](g ) , respectively ) , which hardens and narrows with increasing temperature . a quantitative estimate of the electron - phonon coupling constants and the born effective charges requires a detailed analysis of the lattice dynamics in this complex hyper - kagome structure , which is an important challenge for future theoretical work .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present study , we take the first step in this direction by identifying the origin of the electronic bands coupled to the phonons . to this end , we perform relativistic lda band structure calculations using the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method @xcite for the experimental crystal structure of na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the implementation of the fully relativistic lmto method and calculations of the optical spectra can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the o@xmath71 octahedra surrounding the ir ions in na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 are distorted , the ir @xmath72 shell is split into well separated @xmath4 and @xmath73 states . </S>",
    "<S> a simple electron count shows that the @xmath4 states of each ir are filled by 4.67 electrons . in spite of the noninteger formal valency of an ir@xmath74 ion scalar - relativistic calculations which neglect spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) give an insulating solution with 8 unoccupied doubly degenerate bands separated by a gap of @xmath75ev from the remaining occupied @xmath4 bands </S>",
    "<S> fully relativistic ir @xmath4 bands decorated with circles proportional to the weight of ir @xmath76 and @xmath77 states are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry the kramers degeneracy is lifted everywhere except for time - reversal invariant points . </S>",
    "<S> a striking effect of strong soc within the ir @xmath72-shell is that a pair of unoccupied @xmath4 bands closes the gap and creates two large electron - like fermi surfaces around the @xmath78 point . </S>",
    "<S> the charge balance is then maintained by depopulating hole - like bands near @xmath79 rendering the material semi - metallic , with a negative indirect band gap between @xmath79 and @xmath78 . in semi - metallic materials </S>",
    "<S> strong temperature effects in the optical spectra are expected @xcite . as temperature increases the phonon assistance of the indirect transitions </S>",
    "<S> is dramatically enhanced , which changes the valence and conduction band occupancies at the @xmath78 and @xmath79 points , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this may explain the observed temperature evolution of the low energy electronic background with its spectral weight redistribution over an extended energy range .        </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ]    the relativistic @xmath4 bands are subdivided into a lower- and a higher - energy group of 48 and 24 bands , respectively , reflecting the splitting of ir @xmath4 states into a quartet with @xmath80 and a doublet with @xmath81 by strong soc . as the functions of the @xmath81 doublet are given by linear combinations of @xmath77 states only . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the appreciable contribution of @xmath76 states to unoccupied @xmath4 bands [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) ] implies a strong hybridization between the @xmath80 and @xmath81 states . </S>",
    "<S> an expanded view of the relativistic bands near @xmath82 is shown in fig .  [ fig3](d ) where the two bands which close the scalar - relativistic gap are plotted by green lines while four @xmath81 bands which become partially occupied in order to keep the charge neutrality are shown in red . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions are responsible for a peak of the optical conductivity below 0.1 ev shaded by red in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bands crossing @xmath82 also provide an intra - band drude contribution to the conductivity with @xmath83ev ( not shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) ) which is somewhat larger than the experimentally observed value . </S>",
    "<S> a sharp peak at 0.2 ev ( green shaded area ) is due to interband transitions from occupied @xmath81 bands to the pair of bands which cross @xmath82 near @xmath78 , whereas transitions from the same initial @xmath81 bands to the rest of the unoccupied @xmath4 bands give a broad feature centered at 0.5ev . </S>",
    "<S> finally , transitions from the bands formed predominantly by @xmath80 states to unoccupied @xmath4 bands give a broad maximum of the conductivity at @xmath841.2ev . </S>",
    "<S> the overall shape of the optical conductivity , i.e. a strong , low lying transition followed by a near ir band peaking at about 1ev and an absorption edge setting in between 2 and 3ev , is nicely captured by our calculations , although the absolute values calculated exceed the experimental ones roughly by a factor of two .    </S>",
    "<S> the results presented above emphasize the significance of the electron - phonon interaction in strongly spin - orbit driven systems . because of the lack of inversion symmetry the four @xmath81 bands in na@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 have linear rashba - type dispersion in the vicinity of @xmath79 with their apex lying slightly above @xmath82 , similar to the bulk band structure of bitei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the dipole matrix elements has shown that interband transitions between these partially filled bands have a high probability . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a high density of electron - hole excitations which interfere with superimposed discrete phonon states , in a similar manner as discussed for graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical frustration on the hyper - kagome lattice may facilitate the electron - phonon coupling effects . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments highlight the need for a detailed analysis of the electron - phonon interaction and its influence on the ground states and low energy excitation spectra in the 5d - electron compounds . </S>"
