    "the settling of heavier particles in a lighter fluid  is a rich source of intriguing physics @xcite .",
    "the steadily sedimenting state arises , of course , from a balance between gravity and viscosity .",
    "viscous damping in this nonequilibrium steady state has important consequences : when a given particle is slowed down by the fluid , its momentum does not disappear , but produces disturbances in the fluid which affect the motion of other particles @xcite .",
    "this makes sedimentation a challenging problem in the statistical physics of driven many - body systems .    in the general area of nonequilibrium steady states ,",
    "much recent progress has come by stepping away from the difficulties of hydrodynamics and focussing instead on simple driven lattice - gas models @xcite .",
    "in fact , intimate connections were discovered by two of the present authors ( hereafter lr ) @xcite between these models and the physics of sedimenting crystalline suspensions ( as well as a closely related problem , a flux - point lattice moving through a superconducting slab ) .",
    "the lr model was based on two crucial properties of collective settling discovered by crowley @xcite in his theoretical and experimental studies of hard spheres sedimenting in a viscous medium : ( i ) the _ magnitude _ of the local settling velocity of a region of the crystal depends on its _ concentration _ , i.e. , on the particle number density in that region , and ( ii ) the _ direction _ of the local settling velocity depends on its _ tilt _ , that is , the orientation , relative to the applied force ( gravity ) of the principal axes of the local particle distribution .",
    "these effects , which also follow from symmetry arguments , were incorporated into a natural one - dimensional model for the coupled , stochastic , local spin - exchange dynamics of two sets of ising variables , @xmath0 with states denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the concentration relative to the mean , and @xmath3 with states denoted by / and @xmath4 for the tilt , on the sites @xmath5 of a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "analysis of this model leads to several interesting results , some published in @xcite and some new ones which we present here .",
    "our results will be easier to understand after a quick summary of the update rules of the lattice model , which we turn to next .",
    "this will also serve to underline the simple nature and potentially wide applicability of the model .",
    "it is convenient to place the @xmath0 and @xmath3 on two sublattices of our one - dimensional lattice ; we label sites on the first sublattice by integers , and those on the other by half - integers .",
    "a configuration is then a string @xmath6 , say @xmath7 . using the above notation for the states of the two variables , and denoting the rate of an exchange process by @xmath8",
    ", the probabilities per unit time for the various possible exchanges can be represented succinctly by @xmath9 where the first line , for example , represents the rate of @xmath10 going to @xmath11 in the presence of a downtilt @xmath4 , and so on .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 ( all positive ) and @xmath13 are all in principle independent parameters but we will argue below that the case of physical interest and relevance to the sedimentation and driven flux - lattice problems is sgn@xmath14 sgn@xmath15 , sgn@xmath16 sgn@xmath17 , and that the quantity which controls the qualitative behaviour of the model is then @xmath18 .",
    "we find two completely distinct kinds of behaviour , depending on whether @xmath19 is positive or negative . if @xmath20 , the steady state of the model is a mixture of pluses and minuses , and of uptilts and downtilts , which is statistically homogeneous on a coarse - grained level . if @xmath21 , such a state is _ unstable _ with respect to fluctuations which drive it to a strongly phase separated state of a type defined and discussed below .",
    "we refer to the cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the stable and unstable lr ( slr and ulr ) models respectively .",
    "the focus of this paper is the study of phase separation phenomena of a new and unusual sort , in the unstable lr ( ulr ) model of sedimenting colloidal crystals described above . following the appearance of the lr model ,",
    "the same type of phase separation was shown to occur @xcite in a three - species permutation - symmetric model on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions , with dynamics which may be regarded as a simplified version of that in @xcite .",
    "a further generalisation which breaks the permutation symmetry between the three species was studied in @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism of phase separation appears robust and simple enough that it might be worth looking for in other systems .",
    "here is a summary of our results .    1 .   in the present context , phase separation involves the spontaneous formation of macroscopic domains of @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as / and @xmath4 in the ulr model @xcite",
    "this segregation is robust in that it survives at all temperatures @xmath22 .",
    "let us recall that most statistical systems which show phase separation at low @xmath22 ( or low noise - level , in nonequilibrium cases @xcite ) lose this property at higher @xmath22 or noise strengths",
    ". certainly if one were to think in terms of energy and entropy , this would be the general expectation . against this backdrop ,",
    "a phase separation so robust as to persist at _ all _ finite @xmath22 , and in a one - dimensional system at that , is quite unexpected .",
    "we suggest the name strong phase separation ( sps ) for this unusual phenomenon .",
    "+ the importance of sps in the ulr model arises from the close relation of the latter to a physically realisable system of considerable current interest , namely , sedimenting colloidal crystals . towards the end of this paper",
    "we suggest experiments which can be performed on fluidised beds of colloidal crystals to test some of the ideas presented in this work .",
    "the occurrence of sps can be seen best in a certain limit in which the dynamics of the ulr model obeys the condition of detailed balance . in this limit",
    ", an energy function @xmath23 can be constructed such that the steady - state probability of a configuration @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "although the dynamics is entirely local and involves rates of order unity , the emergent energy function @xmath23 for the effective equilibrium theory involves interactions of unbounded range . as a result , @xmath23 has a nonextensive ( more properly , superextensive ) character , which is how our model and those of @xcite manage to get around the usual obstacles @xcite to phase separation in one dimension . in our model , @xmath23 has a simple interpretation : it is the energy of a collection of particles , _ viz_. the @xmath26s , in a potential landscape built from @xmath27 .",
    "the superextensivity is then a consequence of having potential energy wells whose depths scale with the system size .",
    "+ thermodynamic properties can be calculated in the strongly phase - separated state .",
    "in particular , the width of the interfacial region is found to vanish as @xmath28 and diverge as @xmath29 .",
    "3 .   strong phase separation is a robust phenomenon , and persists even when the condition of detailed balance does not hold .",
    "this can be seen through arguments @xcite based purely on kinetics without recourse to an energy function : the transport of a @xmath1 from one end of a @xmath30 domain to a point a distance @xmath31 away requires a time which grows exponentially with @xmath31 , as @xmath31 moves against the tilt field would be required .",
    "thus a macroscopically phase - separated state would be expected to survive infinitely long in the infinite size limit .",
    "although phase separation is inevitable in the ulr model @xcite and in the models of @xcite , the kinetics of domain growth is anomalously slow .",
    "the barriers that oppose the remixing of the macroscopically segregated state also inhibit the processes of diffusion that cause large domains to grow at the expense of smaller ones .",
    "these barriers , moreover , are produced by the dynamics of the model , not introduced _",
    "ex machina _ in the form of quenched randomness .",
    "this results in intriguing _ ageing _ effects : for instance , the growth of domains is logarithmic in time , as has been verified in numerical studies in @xcite .",
    "further , in the detailed - balance limit , the decrease of @xmath32 is logarithmic in time as well .",
    "thus , despite the _ existence _ of a thermodynamic equilibrium state in the detailed - balance limit , a system which starts from a random initial condition has an extraordinarily difficult time reaching it .",
    "such a system is best thought of as perpetually evolving , never in a truly steady state , sinking slowly into progressively deeper minima , in a manner which recalls the glassy state of the model of @xcite .",
    "arguments given in @xcite already amounted to showing that sps occurred in the ulr model .",
    "specifically , it was shown there that the remixing of phase - separated domains in would _",
    "always _ be opposed by barriers whose height diverged with the system size .",
    "the simulation results of @xcite , however , were complicated by the presence of a repulsion between adjacent @xmath1 sites , which modelled interactions between charged colloidal particles . increasing this repulsion beyond a threshold value led , in the numerical studies of @xcite , to an apparent loss of phase separation .",
    "it is now clear , from the calculations reported in the present paper , that the observed remixing @xcite was a finite - size effect .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in the next section ( [ contmodel ] )",
    ", we review the derivation @xcite of continuum equations of motion for a crystalline array moving through a dissipative medium , and show how , at the linearised level , they lead to either a new class of `` kinematic waves '' @xcite or an instability towards phase separation .",
    "section [ contmodel ] closes by presenting a simplified one - dimensional continuum model which retains all the essential features of the higher - dimensional problem . in section iii ,",
    "we use arguments similar to those connecting the noisy burgers equation to the driven diffusive lattice gas @xcite to construct the lr lattice - gas model @xcite whose long - wavelength limit has the relevant physics of the aforementioned one - dimensional continuum equations .",
    "we show , in a certain highly symmetric limit , that the unstable lr model has a detailed balance property . in this limit",
    "we demonstrate strong phase separation and calculate thermodynamic quantities .",
    "further , we give arguments to show that sps occurs in the entire parameter range of the ulr model .",
    "we argue that the coarsening of domains in the ulr model is ultraslow , with a characteristic length scale growing logarithmically in time .",
    "an analysis of a continuum model for sps is the subject of section iv .",
    "section v summarises our results and suggests experiments to test our predictions .",
    "the lr lattice - gas model @xcite arose as a simplified description of the dynamics of a crystal moving steadily through a dissipative medium .",
    "it is therefore useful to review the construction of the continuum equations of motion for such a system .",
    "there are at least two physical situations where this dynamical problem arises : ( i ) the steadily sedimenting colloidal crystal mentioned above ; ( ii ) a flux - point lattice moving through a thin slab of type ii superconductor under the action of the lorentz force due to an applied current . in ( ii ) , the dissipation comes both from the normal core of the vortices and from disturbances in the order - parameter and electromagnetic fields in the region around the vortices .",
    "there is in principle an important difference between the sedimentation and moving flux - lattice problems : in the former , the disturbances produced by the moving crystal are carried to arbitrarily large length scales by the long - ranged hydrodynamic interaction , while in the latter , both electromagnetic and order - parameter disturbances are screened and are thus limited to a finite range .",
    "a complete analysis of the sedimentation dynamics of a three - dimensional colloidal crystal thus requires the inclusion of the hydrodynamic velocity field as a dynamical variable .",
    "instead , we consider an experimental geometry in which a thin slab of colloidal crystal ( with interparticle spacing @xmath33 particle size ) is confined to a container with dimensions @xmath34 ( gravity is along @xmath35 ) .",
    "the _ local _",
    "hydrodynamics that leads to the configuration - dependent mobilities @xcite is left unaffected by this , but the long - ranged hydrodynamic interaction is screened in the @xmath36 plane on scales @xmath37 by the no - slip boundary condition at the walls . the model equations ( [ eom ] ) in dimension @xmath38 apply to such a system .",
    "our construction of the equations of motion ignores inertial terms , which is justified both for the confined colloidal crystal and , except at very low temperatures @xcite , for the flux lattice . rather than keeping track of individual particles ,",
    "we work on scales @xmath39 , treating the colloidal crystal or flux lattice as a permeable elastic continuum whose distortions at point @xmath40 and time @xmath41 are described by the ( eulerian ) displacement field @xmath42 . in general , the equation of motion in the completely overdamped limit has the form velocity = mobility @xmath43 force , i.e. , @xmath44 in ( [ eomgeneral ] ) , the first term in parentheses on the right - hand side represents elastic forces , governed by the elastic tensor @xmath45 , the second ( @xmath46 ) is the applied force ( gravity for the colloidal crystal and the lorentz force for the flux lattice ) , and @xmath47 is a noise source of thermal and/or hydrodynamic origin .",
    "note that in the absence of the driving force @xmath46 the linearised dynamics of the displacement field in this overdamped system is purely _ diffusive _ : @xmath48 , with the scale of the diffusivities set by the product of a mobility and an elastic constant .",
    "all the important and novel physics in these equations , when the driving force is nonzero , lies in @xmath49 , the local mobility tensor , which we have allowed to depend on gradients of the local displacement field .",
    "the reason for this is as follows : the damping in the physical situations we have mentioned above arises from the interaction of the moving particles with the medium .",
    "a dynamical friction of this kind will in general depend on the local arrangement of particles @xcite . even for a perfect , undistorted lattice , the symmetry of the mobility tensor will thus reflect the symmetry of the underlying lattice . if the structure in a given region is distorted relative to the perfect lattice , the local mobility will depart from its ideal structure as well",
    ". deviations of the structure from the perfect crystal are described by the full distortion tensor @xmath50 @xcite rather than its symmetric part , the strain , since we are not in a rotation - invariant situation .",
    "we further make the reasonable assumption that the mobility can be expanded in a power series in the distortion : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean macroscopic mobility of the undistorted crystal .    for a @xmath53-dimensional crystal driven steadily along the @xmath54 direction , assuming isotropy in the @xmath55-dimensional `` @xmath56 '' subspace normal to @xmath57 , but _ not _ under @xmath58 , ( [ eomgeneral ] ) and ( [ mobility ] ) lead directly to    @xmath59    [ eom ]    where the constant drift along @xmath60 has been removed by shifting to the mean rest frame of the crystal .",
    "the terms that are manifestly most important at small wavenumbers , at least within a linear description , are the linear , first - order space derivative terms .",
    "these terms arise from ( [ eomgeneral ] ) and ( [ mobility ] ) via the leading distortion - dependence of the mobility tensor , multiplied by the driving force @xmath61 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath62 [ as well as those of the @xmath63 terms , as can be seen from ( [ eomgeneral ] ) and ( [ mobility ] ) ] are thus proportional to @xmath61 , and the corresponding terms are therefore present only in the driven state . at small enough wavenumbers ( @xmath64 where @xmath61 is the magnitude of the driving force density and @xmath65 a typical elastic constant ) ,",
    "these terms dominate the diffusive terms coming from the elasticity .",
    "the terms of this type in ( [ eom1 ] ) tell us that a tilt ( a @xmath60 derivative of a @xmath56 displacement or a @xmath56 derivative of a @xmath60 displacement ) leads to a lateral drift , and those in ( [ eom2 ] ) imply that the vertical settling speed depends on the compression ( or dilation ) .",
    "since the system is not invariant under rotations , there are no grounds for insisting that @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is a spatiotemporally white noise source containing the effects of thermal fluctuations as well as chaotic motion due to the hydrodynamic interaction @xcite .",
    "the reader will note that the form of the diffusive second derivative terms and the distortion - dependence of the mobility beyond linear order has been left rather general .",
    "this is because even for @xmath69 , as can be seen by exhaustive listing , symmetry under @xmath70 permits , all told , in ( [ eom1 ] ) and ( [ eom2 ] ) , ten terms ( this counting was wrong in @xcite ) bilinear in @xmath71 and six linear second derivative terms , with as many independent coefficients .",
    "it is clearly difficult to make very useful general statements about a problem with so many phenomenological parameters so we restrict ourselves , in the next subsection , to a linearised description to lowest order in gradients .",
    "we will return to the effects of nonlinearities in later subsections .",
    "if we retain only terms linear in the fields and work only to leading order in wavenumber , then the relation between frequency @xmath72 and wavevector @xmath73 implied by ( [ eom ] ) is @xmath74 .",
    "\\label{omegakd}\\ ] ] the dispersion relation ( [ omegakd ] ) has a wavelike character in all directions if @xmath75 . for @xmath76 , while it is still wavelike for @xmath77 , it has a growing mode @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "_ linearly stable case  kinematic waves _ : the wavelike modes are the generalisation , to the case of a moving lattice , of the kinematic waves which lighthill and whitham @xcite discussed in the context of traffic flow and flood movements .",
    "the important difference in the present case is that the waves propagate not only along but also transverse to the direction of drift .",
    "some remarks towards a more complete consideration of their dispersion relation , including the effects of nonlinearities , may be found in the context of a one - dimensional reduced model in @xcite .    _ linearly unstable case  clumping _ : in the case @xmath80 , for wavevectors pointing outside a cone around the @xmath60 axis , the system is linearly unstable , as already noted in @xcite : small perturbations grow , with a growth - rate which is _ linear _ in their wavenumber . whereas the linearised treatment can not give detailed information about the final state of the system , we expect the growing mode to appear as a clumping and tilting of the colloidal crystal , with material concentrated at the bottoms of the tilted regions .",
    "the wavevector of the inhomogeneity will be mainly normal to the sedimenting direction .",
    "the remainder of this paper is directed towards a more detailed understanding of the statistical mechanics and dynamics of macroscopic clumping .",
    "our studies are based mainly on the simplified one - dimensional lattice model of @xcite .",
    "the construction of the lattice model is reviewed in section [ lrmodel ] : its origins lie in a reduced , one - dimensional version of equations ( [ eom ] ) which we now present .",
    "we saw above that the equations of motion for a moving lattice contained terms of a qualitatively new form , not present in the equations of a lattice at equilibrium .",
    "to linear order , these were the @xmath81 terms in ( [ eom ] ) , which are proportional to the driving force , and of lower order in gradients than those arising from the elasticity of the crystal .",
    "the effects of the linear instability for @xmath80 thus can not be mitigated by including the diffusive terms arising from the linear elasticity .",
    "to see what final state , if any , emerges from the initial unstable growth in the case @xmath80 , we must go beyond a linear treatment . even in the stable case @xmath75",
    ", the combined effects of nonlinearities and noise could result in effective dispersion relations for long wavelength modes which differ qualitatively in their form from those predicted by the linear theory .",
    "however , including nonlinearities , diffusion and noise , as we remarked in the previous subsection , introduces an enormous number of phenomenological parameters .",
    "we note instead that the important new physics of ( [ eom ] ) , namely , the wavelike ( stable case ) or growing modes ( unstable case ) , arises from the coupling of the vertical and horizontal displacement fields , for excitations with wavevector _ transverse _ to the direction of mean drift , while the modes with wavevector along @xmath60 play a relatively minor role .",
    "this suggests that much can be learnt from a model in _",
    "one _ space dimension , the @xmath82 direction , corresponding to the @xmath56 direction of ( [ eom ] ) , but retaining a _",
    "two_-component displacement field @xmath83 .",
    "the symmetry @xmath84 then yields , to bilinear order in fields and leading orders in gradients , the equations of motion    @xmath85    [ eom1d ]    which have , in addition to the @xmath81 , three nonlinear coupling parameters @xmath86 ( also proportional to the driving force @xmath61 ) , two diffusivities @xmath87 , and gaussian spatiotemporally white noise sources @xmath88 , with zero mean , and variances @xmath89 : @xmath90",
    "if @xmath91 and @xmath92 are set to zero , we recover the continuum limit of the equation derived by crowley @xcite for the dynamics of the small transverse and longitudinal displacements of a collection of hard spheres of radius @xmath93 , prepared initially in a horizontal , one - dimensional periodic array with spacing @xmath53 , settling vertically in a highly viscous fluid , with the hydrodynamic interaction cut off at the nearest neighbour scale .",
    "the correspondence is @xmath94 , in units of the stokes settling speed of an isolated sphere .",
    "crowley s calculation can be extended beyond linear order to give @xmath86 , but the elastic forces and the thermal fluctuations that give the @xmath95s and @xmath96s are absent in his model .",
    "the diffusion and nonlinear terms in ( [ eom1d ] ) are identical in structure to those in the erta - kardar ( ek ) models for the fluctuations of drifting lines @xcite , with @xmath97 replaced by their variables @xmath98 in @xcite or @xmath99 in @xcite .",
    "the ek models , however , as a result of a larger symmetry ( _ independently _ under ( i ) @xmath100 and ( ii ) @xmath101 or @xmath102 lack the linear first spatial derivative terms ( the @xmath103 terms ) of ( [ eom1d ] ) .",
    "such linear terms can however be induced through the nonlinear terms , in @xcite by constraining the ends of the line ( polymer ) to be at fixed mean separation normal to the drift direction , so that @xmath104 .",
    "the related coupled - interface model of barabsi @xcite has an @xmath100 symmetry and thus also lacks the @xmath103 terms of ( [ eom1d ] ) .",
    "these models are thus not relevant to the case of greatest interest to us here , namely , the unstable case @xmath80 of ( [ eom1d ] ) .    in the unstable case , within a linear treatment",
    ", the concentration @xmath105 and the tilt @xmath106 grow without bound @xcite . physically , since real colloidal crystals are made of impenetrable particles , and since the elasticity of the lattice will not tolerate arbitrarily large shear - strains , the description implicit in ( [ eom1d ] ) of small distortions about a perfect lattice must break down in conditions of unstable growth .",
    "it is best , therefore , to work from the outset with naturally bounded variables for the concentration and tilt . to this end",
    ", we first pass to a description in terms of the concentration fluctuation field @xmath107 and the tilt field @xmath108 then ( [ eom1d ] ) can be rewritten in the `` conservation - law '' form    @xmath109    [ 1dcons ]    as stated above , @xmath110 and @xmath111 should be bounded ; what matters on large length scales is only whether the local concentration is large or small compared to the mean , and whether the local tilt is `` up '' or `` down '' .",
    "accordingly , we construct a description in the next section in which the concentration and tilt fields of ( [ 1dcons ] ) are replaced by ising variables evolving under a spin - exchange dynamics designed to mimic the most important aspects of ( [ 1dcons ] ) . a continuum model which incorporates saturation",
    "is presented in section [ contsps ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the notion of strong phase separation in connection with the lr lattice model , which describes two coupled species of spins on a lattice , with simple evolution rules which mimic the coupled dynamics of the density and tilt fields .",
    "this coupled - spin problem is too difficult to solve for the dynamics or , indeed , for the steady state for arbitrary values of parameters .",
    "however , for the symmetric case of half filling of both species , and a special relation between coupling constants , we show ( section [ hamdetbal ] ) that the condition of detailed balance is satisfied with respect to a hamiltonian @xmath112 with long - ranged interactions . in turn , this allows for a characterization of the steady state of the system . in section [ thermosps ]",
    ", we show that at zero temperature @xmath22 , the system exhibits phase separation .",
    "moreover , we calculate thermodynamic properties and show that the phase separation survives at _ all _ finite temperatures , which is why we call this phenomenon strong phase separation ( sps ) . the occurrence of sps is linked to the long ( actually infinite ) range of the interactions in @xmath112 , which results in the energy being superextensive ( proportional to @xmath113 rather than @xmath114 ) .",
    "we emphasise that this happens although the underlying dynamical model is entirely local , with finite , bounded rates . in section [ coarsening ] , we show that this unusually robust phase separation sets in anomalously slowly , with domain sizes growing as the logarithm of time .",
    "the survival of sps away from the detailed - balance limit is discussed through a kinetic interpretation in section [ nonsymcurrent ] .",
    "> from the study of driven diffusive systems , it is well known that hydrodynamic behaviour can be recovered from the large - distance long - time behaviour of simple lattice gas models evolving by stochastic dynamics @xcite .",
    "an example of such a model is the asymmetric exclusion process , in which particles on a lattice perform biased random walks subject to the constraint of no more than one particle per site ; in the limit of large separations and time , density fluctuations are described by the burgers equation with an additional noise term .",
    "an advantage of a lattice gas description is that nonlinearities are incorporated implicitly in the nature of the variable  for instance , a @xmath115-valued occupation variable incorporates the effects of exclusion .    are there simple lattice gas models which capture the essential features of coupled density - tilt dynamics of the type discussed in the previous section ?",
    "any such lattice model must , of course , involve two sets of variables  say @xmath0 and @xmath3  which are discrete versions of density and tilt fields and which evolve by rules which mimic the physics of sedimenting lattices .",
    "there are two crucial features of the @xmath116 dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ 1dcons ] ) : first , that both @xmath110 and @xmath111 fields are conserved so that their time derivatives involve the divergences of currents ; and second that the local field which guides the @xmath110-current has a term which is proportional to @xmath111 , and _",
    "vice versa_. accordingly , we define @xcite a lattice model which incorporates just these effects . consider a one - dimensional lattice made of two interpenetrating sublattices @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath119 ) .",

    "these are spatially multidomain states which will not evolve further in the absence of noise .",
    "in summary , we have constructed continuum and lattice models to describe the physics of steadily sedimenting colloidal crystals or , more generally , of a crystal driven through a dissipative medium .",
    "the models display two broadly distinct types of behaviour , termed `` stable '' and `` unstable '' , depending on the sign of a parameter .",
    "we have concentrated on the unstable case and shown , through a mapping to a one - dimensional lattice model , that it _ always _ displays phase separation , a phenomenon which we call strong phase separation . this phase separation and the fact that it persists at all temperatures can be understood , in general , in terms of barriers to remixing which grow with system size .",
    "the barriers are erected by the system in the course of its evolution , and result in domain sizes growing as the logarithm of the time . in a particular limit",
    ", the detailed balance condition holds , allowing us to write the steady state distribution in the equilibrium form @xmath302 , and to calculate density profiles exactly . here",
    "@xmath303 involves long ranged interactions even though the model has strictly local dynamics .",
    "this long - ranged character of interactions in @xmath112 is responsible for the phase separation in this one - dimensional system , and the fact that it persists at all temperatures .",
    "finally , let us turn to the possibility of testing our results in experiments .",
    "we have demonstrated strong phase separation in a _",
    "one - dimensional _ model system .",
    "it seems highly likely , therefore , that the same phenomenon will take place in the experimental systems which inspired our model , namely , steadily sedimenting crystalline suspensions in , for example , the two - dimensional geometry described in section [ intro ] . a good candidate system is a charge - stabilised crystalline array of polystyrene spheres with radius in the micron range .",
    "the lattice spacing of the crystal should be neither so large that hydrodynamic effects ( proportional to the ratio of particle size to interparticle spacing ) are negligible , nor so small that the flow is choked .",
    "this will ensure that appreciable hydrodynamic flow takes place between the spheres , giving rise to the strain - dependent mobilities @xcite that are used in ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "if the system parameters are as in @xcite , the reynolds number will be negligible , as required by our neglect of inertia , and the peclet number large .",
    "note that our model equations ( [ eom ] ) were formulated to describe the nature of distortions about a single crystalline domain .",
    "in particular , the instability towards clumping takes place only on large enough length scales . in a polycrystalline sample , if the size of the crystallites is too small , terms from the elastic energy in ( [ eom ] ) could dominate instead .",
    "in addition , it is important that the sedimentation be steady , a requirement best met by working in the fluidised - bed geometry in which the particles constituting the crystal are on average at rest in the laboratory frame of reference , and the fluid flows vertically upwards past them",
    ". we would recommend starting with the suspension in the fully sedimented state , and then switching on the upward flow .",
    "observations in @xcite suggest that strongly charge - stabilised crystalline suspensions appear stable whereas suspensions in a fluid state display the crowley instability in a visible manner .",
    "we suspect that the instability is present even in the crystalline suspensions , but is masked either by finite crystallite size or by the logarithmically slow coarsening of domains .",
    "we predict that careful measurements of the time - evolution of the static structure factor , using particle - imaging or ultrasmall - angle scattering techniques , should reveal a weak large - scale modulation of the particle concentration , with characteristic wavevector normal to the sedimentation direction and decreasing logarithmically in time .",

    "<S> we study the steady state resulting from instabilities in crystals driven through a dissipative medium , for instance , a colloidal crystal which is steadily sedimenting through a viscous fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the problem involves two coupled fields , the density and the tilt ; the latter describes the orientation of the mass tensor with respect to the driving field . </S>",
    "<S> we map the problem to a 1-d lattice model with two coupled species of spins evolving through conserved dynamics . in the steady state of this model </S>",
    "<S> each of the two species shows macroscopic phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> this phase separation is robust and survives at all temperatures or noise levels hence the term strong phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> this sort of phase separation can be understood in terms of barriers to remixing which grow with system size and result in a logarithmically slow approach to the steady state . in a particular symmetric limit </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the condition of detailed balance holds with a hamiltonian which has infinite - ranged interactions , even though the initial model has only local dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the long - ranged character of the interactions is responsible for phase separation , and for the fact that it persists at all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> possible experimental tests of the phenomenon are discussed . </S>"
