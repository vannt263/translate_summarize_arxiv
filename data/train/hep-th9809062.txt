    "a great deal of interest has been devoted in recent years to the study of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect , the scattering of charged particles by an impenetrable magnetic flux tube@xcite . this situation was motivated both by potential applications , which come from many different areas , and also by some conceptual difficulties found in the ab scattering of spinless particles . in that case , the born approximation failed to reproduce the expansion of the exact result and , furthermore , the second born approximation turned out to be divergent@xcite .",
    "these issues have been investigated considering as equivalents the ab effect and the scattering of particles interacting through a chern - simons ( cs ) field . in a nonrelativistic context , it was shown that , up to one loop , that is , the second born approximation , agreement of the perturbative calculation with the expansion of the exact result could be achieved by introducing an extra quartic self - coupling of the scalar particles @xcite tuned to eliminate divergences and restore the conformal invariance of the tree amplitude . for the scattering of two spin up fermions it was verified @xcite that an additional self - interaction was not needed since its role was provided by pauli s magnetic term , in accordance with an earlier conjecture @xcite . however , if the fermions had antiparallel spins the effect of the magnetic interaction canceled and a divergence showed up .    from a more basic standpoint",
    ", one can start directly from a relativistic quantum field theory of charged particles interacting through a cs field and then appropriately taking a nonrelativistic limit . proceeding in this way",
    ", purely quantum field theory effects as vacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic moment are automatically incorporated .",
    "such a procedure was applied successfully to the study of the ab scattering for both spin 0 and spin 1/2 particles@xcite .",
    "the calculation was greatly facilitated by the introduction of an intermediary auxiliary cutoff which , in the feynman integrals , separates the regions of high and low energy .",
    "this allows a direct simplification of the integrands and it is closely related to the methods of effective field theories @xcite . for the case of spinless or antiparalel spin fermionic particles , it was found that the low energy part of the amplitude contains a logarithmic divergence in the limit of very high intermediary cutoff .",
    "nevertheless , differently from the nonrelativistic calculations previously mentioned , without any additional hypothesis , the needed counterterm is automatically afforded by the high energy part of the contribution . besides that , terms absent from the direct nonrelativistic calculation were determined .",
    "these new interactions come from the high energy part of the amplitudes and modify in an essential way basic properties of the nonrelativistic scattering .    in this work",
    "we want to pursue these investigations by considering the non - abelian ab effect for spinless particles , which corresponds to the problem of particles without spin but carrying isotopic spin scattered by an isotopic magnetic flux tube .",
    "cosmic strings and black holes are the more natural applications of this subject@xcite .    the non - abelian ab situation was firstly analyzed in a celebrated paper on nonintegrable phase factors @xcite and since then it has been more quantitatively investigated at the quantum mechanical level @xcite .",
    "recently , in a direct nonrelativistic approach , the scattering has been discussed using a non - abelian chern - simons field to simulate the flux tube with results similar to the ones mentioned above for the abelian case @xcite . here",
    "we want to begin from a relativistic formulation which , as said before , already embodies radiative corrections . in this way",
    "we will be able to find next to leading corrections to the results presented in @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the basic particles carry isotopic spin 1/2 .",
    "in the language of the @xmath0 quantum field theory our system is described by the lagrangian density @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the covariant derivative , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the generators of the group su(2 ) . as we shall see , up to one loop , the leading contributions correctly reproduce the nonrelativistic results whereas the next to leading contributions are new corrections to the nonrelativistic calculation .",
    "as we are mainly interested in the nonrelativistic limit , in this work we will employ a strict coulomb gauge .",
    "our work is organized such that in section [ section1 ] the nonrelativistic theory is briefly considered .",
    "we do that not only to fix our notation but also to make easier the comparison with the results of the nonrelativistic limit of ( [ 1 ] ) . in section [ section2 ] , after discussing the one loop renormalization program for the relativistic model , we analyze the two body scattering up to next to the leading nonrelativistic approximation .",
    "final comments and a discussion of our results are presented at the end of that section .",
    "in this section we want to summarize the results of the non - abelian ab scattering of spinless particles . to facilitate comparison , we shall use essentially the same notation as in @xcite , but to keep contact with the results to be derived in the next section , we will employ a cutoff to regularize the spatial part of the loop integrals instead of dimensional regularization as it was done in that reference . the lagrangian density which specifies the model is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an @xmath7 component complex field belonging to the fundamental representation of the @xmath8 group .",
