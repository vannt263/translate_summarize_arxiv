    "2006 for a review ) .",
    "a great deal of effort is being put into constraining the de equation of state parameters in order to better understand the phenomenon . one promising method of placing high accuracy constraints on the de parameters is through weak lensing , which involves measuring the shape of numerous galaxies over a large area of the sky ( e.g. blandford et al .",
    "1991 , bartelmann & schneider 2001 , refregier 2003 ) .",
    "an important source of error in the weak lensing analysis comes from uncertainties in the photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath3 ) estimation to each galaxy , which is required to form a three dimensional map .",
    "while they are less accurate than spectroscopic redshifts ( spec-@xmath3s ) , the extremely large area ( 20 000 deg@xmath4 ) planned for future dark energy surveys necessitates the use of photo-@xmath3s ( see hildebrandt et al .",
    "2010 for a summary of current photometric redshift techniques and capabilities ) .",
    "the effects of photo-@xmath3 uncertainities on weak lensing were studied by huturer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who placed stringent constraints on the degree of accuracy and precision required in order for the redshift estimations to be useful in tomography . indeed , current goals state that the standard deviation of the photo-@xmath3s must be less than 0.05(@xmath5 ) and that any bias in the photo-@xmath3s must be known to a degree of 0.002(@xmath5 ) .",
    "( 2006 ) found that in order to satisfy these criteria , a large spectroscopic survey ( on the order of @xmath6 galaxies ) must be carried out to properly calibrate the photometric redshifts .",
    "several works since then have found that the amount of spectroscopy needed can be reduced by optimizing the spectroscopic survey to cover important redshift ranges ( ma & bernstein 2008 , sun et al .",
    "2009 , berstein & huterer 2010 ) , while bordoloi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied how the photo-@xmath3s themselves can be used for calibration .",
    "because of confusion between breaks , photometric redshifts are especially prone to catastrophic outliers , which can greatly impact the weak lensing analysis ( sun et al .",
    "2009 , bernstein & huterer 2010 ) .",
    "it was found that the number of catastrophic outliers can be greatly reduced if ground - based photometry ( u , g , r , i , z , y ) is complimented with near - infrared ( nir ) photometry ( abdalla et al .",
    "2008 , nishizawa et al .",
    "to this aim , both wfirst and euclid , two space - based instruments that will study weak lensing , will include a nir channel to facilitate accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "however , in their current state , neither instrument can obtain accurate photo-@xmath3s by itself . instead",
    ", they must rely on complimentary observations from ground - based instruments ( such as the proposed large synoptic survey telescope , lsst , or the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system , pan - starrs ) .",
    "various complications may arise from trying to combine such a large amount of data from two or more observatories , and it may be beneficial if a space - based instrument could produce its own optical observations .    in this work , we study how future space - based weak lensing missions may benefit from the addition of on - board optical photometry .",
    "we do this in the context of the current euclid design in order to ground our results in reality , but the conclusions could apply just as well to wfirst or any other future weak lensing instrument .",
    "euclid is comprised of both a visual ( vis ) channel and a near infrared ( nir ) channel .",
    "the proposed vis channel is made of a very broad filter ( @xmath7 ) which covers the wavelength range 0.55 - 0.92@xmath8 m  and will be used primarily to measure galaxy shapes for weak lensing .",
    "the nir photometric channel includes three band - passes ( @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) and spans wavelengths from 1.0 to 1.6@xmath8 m .    while one could design a highly - optimized , multi - element on - board filter system ,",
    "our aim , instead , is to explore simple scenarios that result in relatively small perturbations to the current euclid instrument and mission design . to this end",
    "we explore the impact of adding two on - board optical band - passes ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) to euclid and compare them to the results one would obtain by augmenting euclid observations with ground - based optical observations . in section 2 , we detail the method with which we simulate a catalog of observed galaxies and generate photometric redshifts for each of the galaxies . in section 3",
    "we present the photometric redshift distribution of various filter combinations and compare these with the expected results of combining observations from euclid with either lsst or pan - starrs using the dark energy figure of merit ( fom ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the effects of any systematic offsets between the euclid and ground - based observations on the weak lensing analysis .",
    "in order to study the effect of space - based optical observations , we first needed a catalog of galaxies to be observed . ideally , this catalog would have realistic redshift , color , and luminosity distributions in order to accurately model the galaxy population and its photometric redshift distribution . to this aim , we chose to use the cosmos mock catalog ( cmc ; jouvel et al .",
    "this catalog draws upon observations from the cosmos deep field ( capak et al .",
    "2007 ) and the photometric redshift catalog of those galaxies ( ilbert et al . 2009 ) . by combining the best fitting redshift and extinction with observable properties such as galaxy type and half - light radius ( leauthaud et al . 2007 ) , the cmc is by construction representative of a real galaxy survey .",

    ", the cmc provides best - fitting spectra and observed properties of 538 000 galaxies from the cosmos - acs catalog and covers an effective area of 1.24 deg@xmath4 .",

    "the proposed observational strategy for euclid involves taking 4 dithered exposures of each field , with the total integration time of each dither being approximately 700s ( duvet 2010 ) .",
    "euclid is designed such that the vis and nir channels can observe simultaneously . in order to limit the number of moving parts during the vis integration",
    ", the nir spectrometer and the vis channel will observe first ( with an integration time of @xmath15 540s ) after which the nir photometry bands will observe sequentially ( integration times given in table [ tab : filters ] ) .",
    "all of our simulations for euclid observations assume this observational strategy .",
    "we studied photo-@xmath3 performance with several euclid @xmath0+@xmath1 channel configurations as outlined in a recent csa - sponsored study ( rowlands et al .",
    "we first assumed a best - case scenario where two dichroics split the vis channel light such that the @xmath7 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 filters can all observe simultaneously ( i.e. three separate detectors ) .",
    "however , we also tested other scenarios : one where we removed one detector and dichroic and put the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters on a filter exchanger so that they must share integration time , and another where all the filters are on an exchanger and all feed the same single detector .",
    "finally , we also considered scenarios in which only one additional on - board filter  either @xmath0 or @xmath1  is used .",
    "assuming that the best - fitting sed from a galaxy in the cmc is the `` true '' signal from the galaxy , we simulated the observed magnitude of each galaxy in each of the euclid filters ( properties shown in table [ tab : filters ] ) by adding a random noise component to the `` true '' signal measured through each filter .",
    "our method of estimating noise follows closely that described in the appendix of jouvel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , but a brief outline is given here .",
    "first , we calculated the expected signal to noise ratio ( @xmath16 ) . for space - based observations ,",
    "the @xmath16 can be found by @xmath17    here , @xmath18 is the number of electrons produced in the device by the galaxy flux .",
    "the noise contributions in the denominator include poissonian noise from the source as well as the background zodiacal light ( @xmath19 ) , the dark current caused by the thermal radiation of the instrument ( @xmath20 ) , and also the read - out noise of the detector ( @xmath21 ) which follows a gaussian statistic .",
    "@xmath22 is defined to be the number of pixels contained within a circular area of 1.4 times the observed full width at half maximum of the galaxy , and @xmath23 is the number of exposures ( 4 as planned in the euclid survey ) and @xmath24 is the exposure time . for the vis channel",
    ", we use @xmath20=0.03 electrons per second , @xmath21 = 6 electrons , and assume 0.1 arcsecond pixels , whereas for the nir we assume @xmath20=0.05 electrons per second , @xmath21 = 5 electrons , and 0.3 arcsecond pixels . the on - board optical @xmath0 and @xmath1 channel",
    "is assumed to have the same pixel scale as the nir channel ( 0.3 arcsecond pixels ) , but the ron and dark current of the vis channel .",
    "once the theoretical @xmath16 is determined , we simply added an error term to the true magnitude of the galaxy which is drawn from a gaussian distribution of mean @xmath25 and standard deviation @xmath26 . in this way",
    ", realistic observational uncertainties are included in our final simulated observations , as is demonstrated in figure [ fig : error ] . by comparing figure [ fig : error ] with results from other radiometric performance simulations of euclid ( the euclid reference payload concept document ( duvet 2010 ) predicts a @xmath16 of 14.3 for the @xmath7 filter at a magnitude of 24.5 , and 7.1 for the ir filters at magnitude 24 ) , we are confident that our noise generation procedure produces reasonable results .    for ground - based lsst observations our error simulations followed a different approach .",
    "in accordance with ivezic et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the expected photometric error for a single observation of a galaxy is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "here @xmath32 is the 5@xmath14 depth for point sources in a given band and @xmath33 is based on factors such as the sky brightness and readout noise .",
    "values for @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be found in table [ tab : lsst_params ] . to account for repeat observations ,",
    "@xmath29 is divided by 10 to give the error after 100 observations . in a similar fashion to the space based observations above , an error term was added to each of the model magnitudes , which is drawn from a gaussian distribution but now with @xmath34 .",
    "gaussian errors for pan - starrs are assumed to have the same form as those for lsst , but have been adjusted to match the sensitivities given in abdalla et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for a pan-4 like scenario ( table [ tab : lsst_params ] ) .    from the `` true '' signals of the cmc , we thus created a catalog of realistic observations for lsst , for pan - starrs , and for euclid combined with a proposed on - board @xmath35 optical channel .      from the noisy observations",
    ", we then calculated a photometric redshift to each galaxy for various filter combinations .",
    "the photometric redshifts were estimated by comparing the simulated observed broadband photometry with a grid of the model seds from the cmc .",
    "while this creates a situation where our model sed templates perfectly match the `` reality '' of the cmc galaxies , and therefore over - estimates the photo-@xmath3 quality , we feel this is an unavoidable approach .",
    "while some systematic effects of choice of sed templates are known ( for example , the bc03 templates are thought to under - estimate stellar mass due to a poor treatment of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase ( bruzual 2007 ) ) , most are not well understood .",
    "it would therefore be very difficult to realistically model the scatter and possible bias of the photometric redshift estimates as a consequence of our choice of model templates .",
    "we chose to instead focus on contributions to the photo-@xmath3 error resulting from random photon statistics and possible systematic instrument calibration errors , but acknowledge that the photo-@xmath3s given here may be slightly worse in reality because of imperfect sed templates .    to calculate the photometric redshifts",
    ", we used the sedfit software package ( sawicki & yee 1998 , sawicki 2011 [ in prep ] ) .",
    "this software redshifted the cmc model spectra onto a grid of redshifts spanning @xmath36 in steps of 0.02 and attenuated them using the madau ( 1995 ) prescription for continuum and line blanketing due to intergalactic hydrogen along the line of sight .",
    "it then integrated the resultant observer - frame model spectra through filter transmission curves to produce model template broadband fluxes .",
    "in order to match the model template fluxes to the simulated observations , the observed fluxes of each object were compared with each template in the grid by computing the statistic @xmath37 ^ 2\\over\\sigma^2(i)},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath14(i ) are the observed flux and its uncertainty in the @xmath39th filter , and @xmath40 is the flux of the template in that filter .",
    "the variable @xmath41 is the scaling between the observed and template fluxes , and can be computed analytically by minimizing the @xmath42 statistic with respect to @xmath41 giving @xmath43 ( sawicki 2002 ) . for each object ,",
    "the most likely redshift is determined by the smallest @xmath42 value over all the templates .",
    "error bars are generated by refitting the object 200 times with slightly perturbed photometry and finding the range in which 68% of the fits lie .      in order to objectively compare the different observational scenarios , we employ the de figure of merit ( fom ) proposed by the dark energy task force ( detf ) .",
    "this number is the inverse of the area of the 2-@xmath14 uncertainty ellipse in the plane of the de parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the fom is thus a statement on the precision of the de measurements , not necessarily the accuracy .",
    "we used the icosmo package ( refregier et al .",
    "2008 ) to calculate the fom for each of our survey scenarios assuming a flat cosmology with fiducial cosmological parameters of @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 $ ] , an intrinsic ellipticity dispersion of 0.25 , and 10 tomographic redshift bins .",
    "the calculations are done using only the weak lensing power spectrum which is summed over @xmath49 , and the @xmath50 uncertainty is marginalized over the other five parameters without any external priors .    to orient our comparisons ,",
    "the euclid science book ( refregier et al . 2010 ) states that the current fom is on the order of 10 , which is generated using wmap observations combined with baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and type ia supernova distance measurements , as well as a prior adopted in accordance with big bang nucleosynthesis ( komatsu et al .",
    "this is the fom value currently achieved by combining several available de probes ; in contrast , in the rest of the paper we presenting fom values attainable from weak lensing observations alone , without the inclusion of other probes available now or in the future .",
    "a fom generated _ solely _ from a weak lensing survey using both space - based and ground - based observations is expected to be approximately 180 ( see table 4.1 in euclid science book ) , over an order of magnitude greater than the current figure .",
    "however , values can vary depending on the parameters and methods used to estimate the expected fom . for example , amara & refregier ( 2007 ) obtain a fom of only 50 for a survey with properties similar to what is expected with euclid plus ground - based observations ( 20 000 deg@xmath4 area , 35 gals / arcmin@xmath4 , median redshift of 0.9 ) . regardless",
    ", if all cosmological probes observable with euclid are utilized then the fom increases to @xmath51 , and well over 1000 with the use of external prior constraints derived from planck .",
    "it is informative to discuss how various parameters of the photometric redshift distribution affect the fom .",
    "amara & refregier ( 2007 ) have shown that the fom is almost directly proportional to the number density of galaxies in the photometric redshift catalog .",
    "however there is a trade - off between a wide and a deep survey , as they show that the fom also depends strongly on the median redshift of the photo-@xmath3 distribution ( fom @xmath52 ) .",
    "the figure of merit also degrades as the precision of the photometric redshifts decreases ( fom @xmath53 ) and as the fraction of objects with catastrophic redshift errors ( @xmath54 ) increases ( fom @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is clear that accurate and precise photo-@xmath3s are important if a respectable fom is to be obtained .",
    "in this work , we used the above procedure to create a catalog of observations for each galaxy in the mock catalog , but limited ourselves to analyzing only those galaxies that have an @xmath56 magnitude less than 24.5 in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "we studied three options for a weak lensing survey : 1 ) using only the filters currently planned for the euclid instrument ( @xmath7 shape channel , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , 2 ) the euclid filters plus additional on - board optical filters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and 3 ) the euclid ir filters ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath10 ) plus ground - based observations from either pan - starrs ( @xmath59 ) or lsst ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the first scenario was done strictly for comparison and is not expected to yield usable photometric redshifts since it has no optical observations .",
    "the second scenario we divided into several sub - cases in which we examined the impact of different exposure times with the two optical filters and also the effect of not using the @xmath7 shape channel for photometry . for the last case we preferentially used lsst for the ground based observations ,",
    "since we found similar although slightly worse photometric redshift results using pan - starrs ( see also abdalla et al . 2008 ) . a summary of the scenarios and results is presented in table [ tab : scenarios ] .",
    "the median redshift for all cases is 0.8 .",
    "the currently proposed strategy for euclid has chosen to rely on other ground - based projects to obtain optical measurements for photometric redshift estimation .",
    "the optical wavelength observations are required in order to obtain accurate low redshift photo-@xmath3s by detecting the various breaks in a galaxy s sed as they appear in our observer frame .",
    "it is well understood that without any optical band - passes , virtually no constraints can be placed on the redshifts of low-@xmath3 galaxies .",
    "thus , it is no surprise that the plot shown in figure [ fig : euclid_only ] contains a large number of catastrophic redshifts as galaxies with @xmath61 are scattered upwards to higher redshifts .",
    "note also that the standard deviation @xmath62 is well above the required level of 0.05 at nearly all redshifts and the fom is less than the present - day value .",
    "obviously , results can be improved by culling galaxies that have low - quality photometric redshift estimates , as shown in figure [ fig : euclid_only_trust5 ] where any galaxy with an uncertainty @xmath63 greater than 0.5 has been removed .",
    "removal of poorly constrained galaxies can be a trade - off , as it tightens up the spread of the photo-@xmath3s and thus raises the fom , but it also reduces the number density of galaxies which acts to lower the fom .",
    "however , in this scenario , culling of poorly fit galaxies results in the removal of almost all galaxies needed for weak lensing in the target range of @xmath64 , resulting in a poor fom .",
    "the point of this exercise is to emphasize that when it is said that euclid will rely on ground - based observations , it is _ fully _ reliant in that a weak lensing de survey will not be possible without optical photometry from other telescopes .",
    "figure [ fig : euclid_ug ] shows the drastic improvement in photometric redshifts that can be found with the addition of two on - board optical band - passes to euclid .",
    "the ability to discriminate low-@xmath3 galaxies from high-@xmath3 ones is invaluable . while the overall standard deviation is still rather high ( @xmath65 ) due to the number of catastrophic failures at low redshift , a simple culling of untrustworthy galaxies ( @xmath66 ) brings this down to below the required level as shown in figure [ fig : euclid_ug_trust5 ] .",
    "the right panels of figures  [ fig : euclid_ug ] and [ fig : euclid_ug_trust5 ] demonstrate that even if the overall standard deviation is high , the standard deviation as a function of redshift can still be below the required value in the key redshift range for weak lensing ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the resulting foms of 122 and 126 for the raw and culled scenarios respectively make it clear that the addition of on - board optical band - passes could make euclid self - sufficient for weak lensing .",
    "although observations from other instruments could of course still be used , euclid would no longer be completely reliant on them .    in the above scenario , both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filter feed dedicated detectors and",
    "so have the maximum exposure time available ( @xmath15 500s , the same as the @xmath7 shape channel ) .",
    "if the two optical bands can not observe simultaneously , but instead have to share observation time as might be the case if a single detector plus a filter exchange mechanism were used , this will have a negative impact on the photometric redshift estimations .",
    "figure [ fig : ugcombo ] shows that the optimal time - sharing arrangement would be approximately an even division of time .",
    "the fom has a maximum at near 50% observing time in each band of 118.84 .",
    "the photometric redshift distribution of this best - case scenario is shown in figure [ fig : combozz ] .",
    "the fom stays at roughly the same level ( @xmath68 ) until the observing time percentage drops below 30% in either band . at the extreme ends of sharing scenarios ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 band observations are more critical than @xmath1 band observations , as the fom with nothing but @xmath1 is 67.4 , much less than the fom = 100.1 for solely @xmath0 band observations .",
    "the larger fom comes from the better constraints the @xmath0 band can place on the lowest redshift galaxies . in order to determine if two optical filters are absolutely necessary , we also tested a scenario with a broad filter that combined the @xmath0 and @xmath1 wavelengths which resulted in a fom of 87.86 . while being able to estimate the photo-@xmath3s of low - redshift galaxies better than just the @xmath1 band , the broadness of this merged filter led to ambiguity as to where the 4000  break falls within the filter , and hence it was not able to break the degeneracy between low-@xmath3 and high-@xmath3 objects as well as simply the @xmath0 filter .",
    "these results show that both a @xmath0 and a @xmath1 filter are required for optimal photometric redshifts .",
    "note , however , that using just the @xmath0 filter gives a fairly adequate fom of @xmath15100 which , while not optimal , may prove to be the best compromise between the instrument s weight and complexity and the best obtainable de constraints .    as a final scenario for euclid",
    ", we tested the effects of splitting the broad shape channel @xmath7 filter into two separate filters , hereafter called @xmath69 and @xmath70 and adding @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters as well . in this scenario ,",
    "all the filters feed one detector and would be mounted on a filter wheel .",
    "euclid s planned total observing time per dither is fixed at @xmath15700s , which was divided among the @xmath71 and @xmath70 filters allowing ten seconds to account for the time taken to change filters .",
    "we found that using four filters ( @xmath72 and @xmath70 ) in this finite amount of time was not beneficial as the short observing time increased the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the best case we found used three filters ( @xmath73 and @xmath70 ) with the observing time split roughly evenly between the three although slightly favoring the @xmath0 band ( 40% , 30% and 30% of the observing time in the @xmath73 and @xmath70 bands respectively ) .",
    "this layout yields a fom of 105 , lower than the scenarios with one broad shape channel and two optical bands , but slightly higher than one broad shape channel and the @xmath0 band alone .",
    "however this figure is an upper limit at best , as it is uncertain if accurate shape measurements will be attainable in the @xmath69 or @xmath70 band with this little observing time .",
    "if the shape channel were to be split up , a different survey strategy that allows more observation time per object may be preferable in order to increase the @xmath16 in the observations , both for photometry and shape measurements      for comparison , we now show what is expected to be obtainable with the use of ground - based telescopes plus the ir bands from euclid . in these scenarios ,",
    "all surveys are assumed to overlap completely and cover the same 20 000 deg@xmath4 area .",
    "this yields a best - case result and if the overlap between euclid s space - based survey and ground - based surveys turns out to be smaller , then the fom would be negatively affected .",
    "in fact , the fom scales linearly with the survey area ( amara & refregier 2007 ) so that if only half of the space - based survey overlaps with the ground - based component then the expected fom will also be cut in half .",
    "figures [ fig : pan4 ] and [ fig : lsst ] show the results for pan-4 and lsst respectively .",
    "the pan-4 scenario is slightly worse than the euclid+@xmath74 case , while the lsst results are slightly better due to its deeper observations relative to pan - starrs .",
    "we will hence use the lsst observations for all future discussion .",
    "abdalla et al .",
    "( 2008 ) note that in order to obtain reliable photo-@xmath3s , shallower surveys such as des or pan - starrs are not well matched to the euclid survey , and show similar effects on the fom due to the increased photo-@xmath3 scatter from these shallower surveys .    in the interest of establishing a time frame for the desired lensing results",
    ", we investigated how long it would take lsst plus euclid to reach the same fom as the euclid plus on - board optical scenario , and found that lsst needs to observe each galaxy at least 45 times to have the same fom ( 126 ) as euclid plus optical filters ( approximately 6 months of observations with lsst ) . after this point , the fom will increase as lsst makes more and more observations .",
    "we now have a simple means of estimating how many lsst observations are needed if equation [ eqn : lssterr ] turns out to be overly generous in reality .",
    "for example , if the lsst photometric errors turn out to be twice as large as predicted , then four times as many observations ( i.e. 180 observations or @xmath75 years ) are needed to match the euclid plus on - board optical fom .",
    "we also studied two scenarios that could detrimentally affect the lsst observations : random photometric zero - point errors , and systematic zero - point offsets between ground and space observations .    the error formulation given in equation [ eqn : lssterr ] for lsst specifically does not include any terms for mis - calibration of the zero - point ( zp ) magnitudes from field to field . to study how any field - to - field zp errors could negatively affect the photo-@xmath3s",
    ", we use the canada - france - hawaii - telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ; erben et al .",
    "2009 , hildebrandt et al . 2009 ) as a reference point .",
    "each pointing of the lsst could have slight errors associated with the zp calibration and so we divided our observational catalog into @xmath76 fields , which is approximately the number of fields required for lsst to cover euclid s 20 000 deg@xmath4 survey . in each field",
    "we add a random gaussian offset to the observed magnitudes in the various filters , where the standard deviations are similar to those found for cfhtls ( hildebrandt , private communication ) and are given in table [ tab : lsst_offset ] .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the spread in the photometric redshifts ( shown in figure [ fig : lsst_offset ] ) and thus slightly decreasing the fom ( though not significantly ) to 132 .",
    "the small deviations expected from field - to - field zp errors are for the most part dominated by the random photometric errors . additionally , the zp errors are independent and thus add in quadrature with the photometric errors , leading to only slight effects in the best - fitting photometric redshifts .",
    "their contribution is therefore almost negligible and we conclude that field - to - field zp offsets in ground data are not likely to be an issue in de weak lensing surveys .",
    "there is also a possibility that the lsst zp magnitudes could be systematically offset from the zps derived for the euclid instrument .",
    "we found that this has the effect of worsening the photometric bias @xmath77 , specifically at redshifts greater than @xmath78 when the 4000  break starts to fall between the lsst filters and euclid s ir filters .",
    "figure [ fig : mu ] demonstrates how this effect worsens as the systematic offset increases . the steep drop - off in bias ( present in nearly all the figures ) above redshift 3 is a result of our brightness restriction , leading to small numbers of galaxies at this redshift and a bias towards galaxies that are erroneously bright in the @xmath7 bandpass due to photometric errors .",
    "the dropoff should not be confused with a failure of lsst , as the sharp decline in bias is also seen in figure [ fig : euclid_ug ] .",
    "the rise in photo-@xmath3 bias can have detrimental effects to the weak lensing analysis , which requires the central redshift of each tomographic redshift bin to be known to better than 0.002(1+@xmath3 ) . while many photo-@xmath3 codes can correct for systematic offsets between band - passes ( e.g. ilbert et al .",
    "2006 , coe et al . 2006 ) , this requires spectroscopic redshifts for comparison .",
    "this highlights the importance of a spectroscopic redshift survey in order to properly calibrate the photometric redshifts .",
    "such a survey is not without its own difficulties in that it has to overcome cosmic variance ( van waerbeke et al .",
    "2006 ) and selection biases in order to obtain a fully representative sample .",
    "the calibration of any systematic zp offsets might be greatly aided if the instruments shared similar band - passes , such as @xmath0 or @xmath1 , and avoided entirely if space - based surveys could be independent .",
    "in this work , we have used the currently proposed euclid design to study how future space - based weak lensing missions might be able to estimate photometric redshifts independently , i.e. without the use of complimentary ground - based observations .",
    "we found that the addition of two or even one optical band - passes to euclid could greatly improve the fidelity of photometric redshifts the telescope can attain by itself .",
    "if the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters are added , the constraints that euclid will be able to place on dark energy from weak lensing ( fom = 119126 ) are comparable to those using a combination of euclid and ground - based lsst observations ( fom = 132 ) .",
    "additionally , quite acceptable dark energy constraints can be obtained if only the @xmath0 bandpass is added to the baseline euclid design ( fom = 100 ) .    in their present form , to fullfil their weak lensing goals missions such as euclid and wfirst must rely on external ground - based observations . including such ground - based observations entails many of the difficulties of combining two very large and different data sets , including , but not limited to , logistical complications , mis - match or potential delays in construction timescales , changes is planned survey designs , or data access limitations .",
    "furthermore , if the survey area of the space - based observations does not overlap entirely with that of the ground - based survey , then the fom will be negatively affected .",
    "for example , if euclid and lsst only share 10,000deg@xmath4 , then the fom obtainable by combining the observations will be only @xmath1566 instead of @xmath15132 in the case of full overlap .",
    "the addition of on - board optical imaging through two or even one filter would avoid most of such complications .",
    "it would allow future space - based instruments to meet their scientific requirements for weak lensing without having to risk relying on external data .",
