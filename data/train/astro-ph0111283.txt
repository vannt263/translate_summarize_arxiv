    "low mass `` debris disks '' ( @xmath5 ) are detected around older main sequence stars ( backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "the dust that gives rise to the ir excesses and scattered light images of debris disks is believed to form from collisions of planetessimals within the disks .",
    "the advent of large ir detector arrays now allows for simultaneous multiwavelength observations of large numbers of disks in star clusters ( e.g. , haisch , lada , & lada 2000 ) .",
    "the upcoming _ sirtf _ mission will greatly increase the wavelength coverage for studying clusters , thereby enabling detailed studies of disks over a wide range in age and mass .",
    "we therefore need to know what spectral indicators are best suited for detecting disks and determining their mass evolution .    in this paper",
    "our working hypothesis is that through time the disk mass decreases but the disk structure and stellar luminosity do not change . in our models",
    "the dominant opacity source for @xmath6 m is small ( @xmath0 ) grains , so another way of stating our model is that we assume the small particle mass traces the total mass of gas + dust .",
    "the small grain mass may decrease by the accretion of disk material or coagulation and growth of large grains and rocks while the gas is either depleted or accreted onto the star keeping the gas / dust ratio constant .",

    "these include approximations for opaque flat disks ( adams & shu 1986 ; adams , lada , & shu 1987 ; lada & adams 1992 ) and extensions of this approach to flared disks ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; chiang & goldreich 1997 , 1999 ) ; two dimensional radiation transfer techniques ( efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1991 ) ; diffusion approximations ( e.g. , sonnhalter , preibisch , & yorke 1995 ; boss & yorke 1996 ) ; disks which are modeled as `` spherical sectors '' ( menshchikov & henning 1997 ) ; vertical structure calculations performed by dividing the disk into plane parallel annuli ( calvet et al .",
    "1992 ; bell et al . 1997 ; bell 1999 ; dalessio et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) ; and monte carlo techniques ( wolf , henning , & stecklum 1999 ) .",
    "common approximations in many of the `` traditional '' codes are to conduct the radiation transfer in only one direction in the disk and assume the dust grains scatter radiation isotropically . also many techniques are limited to the study of optically thick and hence massive disks .",
    "monte carlo techniques are straightforward to adapt to any geometry , mass , and can accurately include polarization and multiple , anisotropic scattering .",
    "we use the monte carlo radiative equilibrium technique of bjorkman & wood ( 2001 ) which conserves energy exactly .",
    "for very optically thick disks we use our monte carlo technique for the upper layers of the disk ( i.e. , the disk `` atmosphere '' ) and a diffusion approximation for the densest midplane regions . for the most massive disks we simulate ,",
    "typically less than 1% of the flux requires a diffusion treatment .",
    "more details of our adaptation of the bjorkman & wood ( 2001 ) technique for simulating t  tauri disks will be presented in bjorkman , wood , & whitney ( 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "an advantage of using monte carlo techniques for studying a range of disk masses , is that we are not restricted to one - dimensional radiation transfer and can therefore simulate seds of low mass optically thin disks in which radial transport of photons is important .",
    "the output of our code is the disk temperature structure ( due to heating by stellar photons and accretion luminosity ) and the emergent sed and polarization spectrum at a range of viewing angles .",
    "a calculation of the hydrostatic disk structure ( e.g. , chiang & goldreich 1997 ; dalessio et al .",
    "1999 ) can be included in the monte carlo technique , but this would require an iterative scheme . at present",
    "we have not implemented such a scheme and instead perform the radiative equilibrium calculation for a fixed disk geometry .      the determination of disk structure from fitting seds and scattered light images does not yield a single structure and dust size distribution that applies to all disks .",
    "some systems are fit with passive flat disks ( e.g. , adams et al . 1987 ; adams et al .",
    "1990 ; miyake & nakagwa 1995 ) , while others require flared disks heated by starlight and accretion luminosity ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; burrows et al . 1996 ; stapelfeldt et al . 1998 ) . the scattered light image of the edge - on disk of hh30  irs ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 ) has for the first time allowed the vertical structure of a protoplanetary disk to be studied directly .",

    "assuming @xmath18k , @xmath19 , and circumstellar dust sublimates at 1600k , then @xmath20 .",
    "this is larger than the dust destruction radius for optically thin dust because the reprocessed emission from the disk provides additional heating over and above the direct stellar radiation , increasing the size of the dust destruction zone ( a detailed discussion of the shape of the dust destruction region will be presented in bjorkman et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) . in currently popular magnetic accretion models",
    "the disk is truncated at a radius @xmath21 , which may not be equal to @xmath17 . if @xmath22 there will be a gas disk extending from @xmath21 to @xmath17 which may give rise to additional ir emission .",
    "our models therefore assume that any material within @xmath17 is optically thin , which is a good approximation for low mass disks . for high mass disks the gas may be optically thick producing larger near - ir excesses .",
    "recent modeling of hst images ( cotera et al .",
    "2001 ) and the sed of hh30  irs ( wood et al . 2001 ) indicates that the circumstellar dust size distribution extends to larger grain radii than typical ism grains .",

    "2000 ; chiang et al . 2001 ; van den ancker et al .",

    "we have not investigated the effects of different chemical compositions on the the resulting disk seds .",
    "how the circumstellar chemistry effects the sed is an interesting problem , but it is beyond the scope of this paper and we present models for different disk masses and the dust properties shown in figure  1 . in addition , our models do not include additional heating from transiently heated small grains ( see the new radiation transfer code of misselt et al . 2001 ) which is not important in the cooler classical t  tauri stars considered in this paper .",
    "the energy input to the disk is from stellar photons and accretion luminosity liberated in the disk .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we fix the disk structure for our radiation transfer simulations . given the disk structure ( eq .  1 ) , @xmath31 disk theory determines the accretion rate for a given disk mass .",
    "our parameterization of the disk density and accretion follows that presented in the review by bjorkman ( 1997 ) , apart from the term @xmath32 .",
    "the accretion rate and viscosity parameter , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are related to the disk parameters by @xmath35 where the critical velocity @xmath36 .",

    "is adjusted so that @xmath41 in line with recent observational determinations of accretion luminosities in classical t  tauri stars ( hartmann et al",
    "the following models use @xmath42k , @xmath19 , @xmath43au , and a distance of 500pc to the system .",
    "figure 2 shows the effect on the sed of changing the disk mass , but keeping the disk structure fixed to that of our fiducial model .",
    "the massive optically thick disks produce seds that resemble that of the kenyon & hartmann ( 1987 ) flared disk model , aside from differences ( addition of scattered light to pole - on views and silicate features ) due to our inclusion of a finite albedo and non - gray opacity .",
    "the most massive disk has a very large near - ir excess due to the large accretion luminosity present in this model .",
    "the model seds display the characteristic features present in other simulations : large infrared excess emission , flat spectrum sources at intermediate inclinations , and double peaked spectra ( optical and far - ir peaks ) for very large inclinations . at large inclinations ,",
    "the optical peak is due to scattered starlight as the dense disk totally obscures the star and disk emission at short wavelengths .",
    "reducing the disk mass has the most dramatic effect at long wavelengths with the sed rapidly declining with decreasing mass . at short wavelengths",
    "the disk remains optically thick to stellar photons over a wide range of mass so the near - ir excess is not as sensitive to mass .",
    "figure  4 presents our models again , with the three panels showing seds for the range of disk masses at a given inclination .",
    "these results show similar features to the models of menshchikov & henning ( 1997 , their fig .",
    "12 ) who presented seds for a range of optical depths in a spherical geometry with evacuated bipolar cones .",
    "the _ sirtf _ sensitivity limits show that at a distance of 500pc very low mass disks ( @xmath44 ) are detectable out to a wavelength of @xmath45 . at @xmath46 _ sirtf _ will be sensitive to photospheric flux levels at 500pc , thus allowing for the detection of even lower mass disks .",
    "our overall conclusion from these simulations is that near - ir excesses detect disks while far - ir excesses can be used to study their mass .",
    "figure  4 shows the variation of colors with disk mass for @xmath47 . at long wavelengths we use the simulated flux at @xmath45 and @xmath48 in forming the color and",
    "have not adopted any particular color system .",
    "the colors are fairly insensitive to inclination for @xmath47 , but see  3.3 for color - color and color - magnitude diagrams that include highly inclined disks . for a passive disk with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , decreasing to a fairly constant @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "larger @xmath2 colors arise in massive disks where accretion luminosity is included , @xmath53 for @xmath49 . in our models ,",
    "less massive disks do not sustain large accretion rates ( see  2.3 ) and the @xmath2 excess is due to reprocessing of starlight . for these disks",
    ", @xmath2 is fairly insensitive to mass as the disk remains optically thick in the near - ir for masses @xmath54 . therefore ground",
    "based near - ir observations are capable of detecting very low mass disks . again",
    ", we emphasize that this is the mass of small ( @xmath0 ) particles which dominate the near - ir opacity .    at longer wavelengths the sed decreases with decreasing disk mass and this",
    "is reflected in the other color indexes remaining relatively flat with disk mass until the disk becomes optically thin at the waveband under study . at the longest _ mips _",
    "wavelength , @xmath55 m , the @xmath56 color shows a clear progression from the most massive to least massive disk .",
    "figure  5 shows color - color diagrams for our model disks assuming intrinsic stellar colors from kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 , table a5 ) .",
    "when we include all disk inclinations there are degeneracies in the color - mass parameter space , with large viewing angles generally leading to redder colors .",
    "this result differs from other investigations ( e.g. , lada & adams 1992 ; kenyon , yi , & hartmann 1996 ; meyer , calvet , & hillenbrand 1997 ) which assumed the disk emission was proportional to @xmath57 , giving the bluest colors for edge - on viewing .",
    "more detailed radiation transfer modeling shows that a simple @xmath57 scaling does not give the correct inclination dependence for flared disk models .",
    "the effect of changing the disk mass is not very strong in the @xmath58 diagram for @xmath44 , reflecting that at short wavelengths the disks remain optically thick over a wide range of mass .",
    "the disk masses separate out more clearly in the @xmath59 diagram .",
    "therefore color - color diagrams of large numbers of sources that compare near and far infrared colors provide a means of determining the range of disk masses within a cluster .",
    "figure  5 showed that inclination effects lead to a large spread in the location of different disk masses in the color - color diagrams .",
    "this leads to degeneracies in the location of different disk masses",
    ". however , fig .",
    "6 shows how color - magnitude diagrams can help in breaking the mass - inclination degeneracy .",
    "placing all our disk models on color - magnitude diagrams shows that disks viewed at large inclinations occupy the lower righthand corners , i.e. , highly inclined disks are faint and red .",
    "the previous sections presented seds for disks which have the flaring parameters that fit hh30  irs images and sed .",
    "however , other investigations indicate a variety of disk structures in classical t  tauri stars ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; miyake & nakagawa 1995 ; chiang et al . 2001 ) . to investigate the effects of flatter disks on seds and colors we repeated the simulations of fig .  2 with a reduced scaleheight @xmath60 giving @xmath61au .",
    "the smaller scaleheight results in the disk intercepting less stellar radiation ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) and consequently smaller excesses and bluer colors than our models in   3 .",
    "for a given disk mass , the mm flux is unaltered , but the mid to far - ir emission is sensitive to the disk structure ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; chiang et al .",
    "the qualitative variation of the seds and colors with disk mass remains the same .      in our models",
    "the dust size distribution does not change as the disk mass decreases .",
    "however , small dust grains may coagulate to form larger grains and rocks thereby altering the grain size distribution in the disk ( e.g. , beckwith , henning , & nakagawa 2000 ) .",
    "this will lead to changes in the wavelength dependence of the opacity .",
    "dalessio et al .",
    "( 2001 ) investigated grain growth by keeping the disk mass constant and increasing the maximum grain size ( effectively reducing the population of small grains ) and changing the slope of the power law size distribution . for a slope @xmath24 ,",
    "their sed models show the largest effects occur for @xmath62 m , while for @xmath63 ( which puts more mass into larger particles ) the seds are similar to ours in which the total disk mass decreases .",
    "seds arising from either a low mass disk or a massive disk with large grains may be distinguished with detailed sed modeling .",
    "decreasing the disk radius , but keeping the mass constant results in a disk that is denser and optically thicker than our models of   3 .",
    "a smaller disk effectively removes cool material at large radii that provides the bulk of the long wavelength emission , yielding smaller far - ir and mm fluxes ( e.g. , beckwith et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the other effect of squeezing the disk into a smaller volume is an increase in the height above the midplane at which stellar photons are absorbed .",
    "this gives a geometrically thicker dust disk that can intercept more stellar photons , raising the near and mid - ir emission .",
    "the overall effects of a very small disk are to increase the wavelength at which the disk becomes optically thin yielding larger @xmath2 colors and a slower decline in the @xmath64 color with decreasing mass . the larger optical depth for small disks will lower the minimum disk mass that may be detected from @xmath2 colors .",
    "large radius disks give the opposite of these effects : less near and mid - ir , and more far - ir and mm emission .      in order to investigate general trends ,",
    "we have presented a simple model for disk evolution of protoplanetary disks in which the mass decreases homologously with time .",
    "real disks will be more complicated than this , with the disk radius growing , changes in the flaring parameters due to dust settling , and the possibility of accretion being terminated through the opening up of large inner disk holes and gaps , resulting in `` inside - out '' evolution .",
    "current data does not provide much support for the existence of large holes in protoplanetary disks : if they do not show near - ir excesses , mid - ir and mm excesses are usually absent also ( stassun et al .",
    "2001 , haisch , lada & lada 2001a ) , but there are some exceptions notably gm  aur ( koerner , sargent , & beckwith 1993 ) .",
    "_ sirtf _ should be able to distinguish between low mass protoplanetary disks , whose mass has evolved homologously ( without creating large inner holes ) , and disks which have evolved by creating large inner holes and thus directly test the inside - out disk clearing scenario",
    ".    debris disks often exhibit large inner holes or a ring - like structure ( e.g. , koerner et al . 1998 ; jayawardhana et al .",
    "1998 ; schneider et al . 1999 )",
    ". however , debris disks are not likely to be protoplanetary disks that have evolved large inner holes .",
    "debris disks are sufficiently old that the dust in them is not remnant protoplanetary material but instead is created and continually replenished by collisions between planetessimals formed previously in the disk .",
    "moreover , protoplanetary disks which simply evolve from the inside out by clearing large inner holes ( but otherwise maintaining their initial structure ) , will still contain large reservoirs of material in their outer regions and thus should be considerably more massive than debris disks .",
    "observations at mm and radio wavelengths , where the disk is optically thin , provide the best probe of disk mass ( e.g. , beckwith et al . 1990 ) .",
    "when such data is not available our models show that far - ir , and in certain circumstances even mid - ir data , can provide another means of probing disk mass ( if the disks are not too massive and optically thick ) .",
    "for example , kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) presented a compilation of optical through far - ir observations of taurus - auriga sources and noted a pronounced gap in the @xmath65 distribution between the bluest class  ii and the reddest class  iii sources .",
    "figure  7 shows the @xmath58 color - color diagram for the taurus - auriga sources along with our face - on model colors for various disk masses . in the context of our models",
    ", the gap in the @xmath65 distribution corresponds to disks with @xmath66 and indicates that there are few circumstellar disks with masses between @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 in the taurus - auriga cloud ( of course , this disk mass does not include rocks and planets ) .",
    "this , in turn , could be interpreted to indicate that once the disk mass falls below @xmath70 the timescale for clearing the remaining material in the inner ( @xmath71au ) disk is very rapid .",
    "we have investigated the observational signatures of an evolutionary model in which the disk mass decreases homologously , but the disk structure and stellar parameters remain constant with time .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * * _ near - ir observations detect disks . _ * disks remain optically thick in the near - ir over a wide range of disk mass resulting in measurable @xmath2 excesses for disks down to @xmath72 .",
    "this corresponds to a dust mass of @xmath73 . * * _ mid - ir observations probe disk structure .",
    "_ * observations in the @xmath74 range are sensitive to the disk flaring parameters and are crucial for determining the degree of dust settling . * * _ far - ir most sensitive to disk mass .",
    "_ * the far - ir emission decreases rapidly with disk mass resulting in a strong correlation between @xmath56 and disk mass .",
    "our simulations indicate that at a distance of 500pc , _ sirtf _ will be able to detect @xmath44 with a 500s exposure at @xmath45 and even lower masses at @xmath75 . * * _ general trends are reproduced for a range of disk parameters . _ * despite degeneracies in fitting seds of particular sources , we find that varying the disk parameters within generally accepted limits introduces a spread in the color - mass relationship , but does not affect the general trends .    the degeneracies inherent in fitting disk models to wavelength restricted datasets illustrates that it is necessary to have full sed coverage to constrain the disk structure and dust size distribution ( e.g. , menshchikov & henning 1997 ; chiang et al .",
    "2001 ; dalessio et al .",
    "_ sirtf _ , _ sma _ , and _ alma _ will provide detailed seds for nearby sources enabling detailed modeling of the disk mass and structure . for studies of stellar clusters",
    ", such data will not be available and mm observations , which are most sensitive to disk mass , can not as yet achieve the required sensitivity and resolution to study low mass disks and/or distant clusters .",
    "therefore , we must appeal to statistics and determine average properties of sources in different clusters for studying disk evolution .",
    "_ sirtf _ will provide broad band colors for hundreds of sources within a given cluster , from which we can construct median colors and the spread around the median for each cluster ( e.g. , haisch , lada , & lada 2001b ) . from our models",
    "it is apparent that nir excesses detect disks , and therefore the absence of a @xmath2 excess within a cluster of a given age can determine the maximum disk lifetime . by comparing the median colors from different clusters with a spread in age ( as a whole and as functions of position within the cluster ) ,",
    "we can search for trends as a function of cluster age .",
    "therefore , the far - ir probed by _ sirtf _ may allow us to determine a timescale for disk evolution  i.e. , in our homologous evolutionary model we would be able to convert the color - mass correlation to one which tracks disk mass in clusters as a function of age , analogous to the recent _ iso _ analysis of debris disks by spangler et al .",
