    "metal / semiconductor ( ms ) interfaces have been the focus of extensive theoretical and experimental studies for several decades.@xcite to date , however , we are still far from a complete understanding of the factors which control the schottky barrier height ( sbh ) at these interfaces . in recent years",
    ", new research activities have been developed in the area of band engineering at ms interfaces@xcite and on the properties of metal / wide - gap - semiconductor contacts.@xcite these developments have stimulated renewed interest in some basic issues concerning schottky barriers , and in particular in the mechanisms that control the sbh dependence on bulk - semiconductor and interface - specific characteristics .",
    "the problem of schottky barrier formation has been traditionally addressed by studying the dependence of the sbh on the metal used in the junction.@xcite early studies suggested a schottky - mott behavior controlled by the metal work function for highly ionic or wide - gap semiconductors , and a weak dependence on the metal type and on the junction fabrication method for the most covalent semiconductors , such as si or gaas.@xcite the latter trend was generally attributed to various fermi level pinning mechanisms , such as pinning by metal - induced - gap states ( migs)@xcite at an intrinsic charge neutrality level of the semiconductor@xcite or pinning by native defect states of the semiconductor at some extrinsic gap level.@xcite furthermore , a correlation between schottky barriers and heterojunction band offsets was observed experimentally for a number of systems,@xcite and similarly ascribed to fermi level pinning at a bulk reference level .",
    "finally , the effect of the semiconductor ionicity on the sbh trend with the metal work function was examined in pioneering self - consistent studies of jellium / semiconductor contacts , and the trend could also be generally understood in terms of migs properties of the semiconductor.@xcite    more recent experiments on metal contacts to covalent semiconductors , however , have revealed a much weaker electronic pinning than was previously believed.@xcite in particular , there have been reports of considerable changes in metal / si and metal / gaas sbh s obtained by altering the structural properties and/or the chemical composition of the interface.@xcite the conclusion that the sbh does depend most generally on the microscopic atomic structure of the interface has been reached by many authors , both on experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite grounds . while opening a promising line of research on schottky barrier engineering , these observations",
    "complicate seriously the search for simple models of schottky barrier formation , since the inclusion of the interface atomic structure seems unavoidable .",
    "given the complexity and variety of the atomic structure at metal / semiconductor contacts , it seems unlikely that a simple unified model could emerge and entirely cover the various facets of schottky barrier formation .",
    "conversely , a systematic investigation of the problem starting from abrupt , defect free interfaces , and progressively introducing perturbations at the interface could help identifying relevant microscopic mechanisms and provide a firmer basis for modeling schottky barrier properties .",
    "progress in computational physics have made possible accurate _ ab initio _ calculations of the electronic structure of ms contacts , and the complexity of the systems which can be examined is steadily increasing ; this type of computations can provide the means to carry out such an investigation and probe the correlation between microscopic atomic structures and sbh s .",
    "the present study is a first step in this direction .    in this article , we study from first principles the dependence of the sbh on selected bulk and surface characteristics of the semiconductor , for a given metal .",
    "specifically , we examine abrupt al/@xmath0  ( 100 ) junctions , where @xmath1 ( ge , gaas , alas , and znse ) are lattice matched semiconductors of increasing ionicity , and we investigate the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the sbh changes with the semiconductor chemical composition and surface termination ( cation or anion ) . a model based on a linear - response - theory scheme",
    "is then developed , which explains our _ ab initio _ results and sbh trends observed experimentally .",
    "we have carried out _ ab initio _ calculations , within the local - density approximation ( lda ) to density functional theory ( dft ) , using the pseudopotential method.@xcite we used norm - conserving scalar - relativistic troullier - martins pseudopotentials@xcite in the kleinman - bylander non - local form@xcite and the exchange - correlation functional of ceperley and alder.@xcite the electronic states were expanded on a plane - wave basis set using a kinetic energy cut - off of 20  ry .",

    "the semiconductor surface is terminated either by an anion ( i ) or a cation ( ii ) plane.,width=325 ]    we considered ideally abrupt epitaxial junctions and neglected atomic relaxation at the interfaces .",
    "the effect of atomic relaxation at the al / gaas  ( 100 ) and al / znse  ( 100 ) interfaces has been examined in refs .   and .",
    "atomic relaxation decreases ( increases ) the @xmath7-type schottky barriers of the abrupt al / gaas ( al / znse ) junctions by 00.1  ev@xcite ( 0.10.2  ev@xcite ) , and has no influence on the sbh ordering of the anion- and cation - terminated interfaces .    the epitaxial alignment of al on the ( 100 ) surfaces of the four semiconductors under study is illustrated in fig .",

    "experimentally  and also in our calculations  ge , gaas , alas , and znse are lattice - matched semiconductors , and the equilibrium lattice constant of al is slightly larger ( 1% ) than @xmath10 .",
    "this results in a small compressive strain in the al in - plane lattice parameter , which is accommodated by an elongation ( @xmath11% ) of the al overlayer , assuming pseudomorphic conditions . for the semiconductor lattice parameter",
    ", we used the theoretical value @xmath12    ( @xmath13   ) .",
    "the metal - semiconductor interlayer distance @xmath14 at the junction was taken as the average between the ( 100 ) interlayer spacings in the semiconductor and in the ( strained ) al bulk parts , i.e. , @xmath15   . the polar al/@xmath0  ( 100 ) junction offers two inequivalent abrupt interfaces , either with anion- or cation - terminated semiconductor surface , which we both considered in our study [ see fig .

    "the band - structure term @xmath19 is characteristic of the individual bulk crystals forming the junction .",
    "this term was computed using the kohn - sham ( ks ) eigenvalues of standard bulk band - structure calculations .",
    "the potential lineup @xmath18 contains all interface - specific contributions to @xmath16 and was obtained  via poisson s equation and using a macroscopic average technique@xcite  from the self - consistent supercell charge density .    for a meaningful comparison of our calculated sbh s with experiment , @xmath20 should include quasiparticle and spin - orbit corrections .",
    "the spin - orbit correction is simply @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total spin - orbit splitting at the semiconductor valence - band maximum , which was taken from experiment . for a metal , in principle ,",
    "the _ exact _ ks fermi energy and the quasiparticle fermi energy must coincide at zero temperature.@xcite furthermore , lda calculations for the work functions of various al surfaces performed with the same method and the same pseudopotentials as in the present study  and neglecting many - body corrections on the al fermi energy  yielded values which agree with the experimental data to within a few tenths of mev.@xcite in the present study , therefore , for the metal fermi energy we just used the lda result .",
    "the corrected band term is thus @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the ks band term and @xmath25 is the difference between the quasiparticle and ks semiconductor vbm energies .    for the quasiparticle corrections",
