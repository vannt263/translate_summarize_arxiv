    "the observations of a number of new resonances , such as the narrow states @xmath13 in the @xmath14 final state and @xmath15 in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 channel  @xcite , have brought great opportunities for our understanding of nonperturbative qcd in the charm mass region .",
    "they also initiate tremendous efforts on the exploration of exotic hadrons beyond the naive quark model and revive great interests in the study of the @xmath18 spectrum  @xcite .    in the heavy quark limit",
    ", the heavy quark will decouple from the light degrees of freedom and act as a static color source .",
    "strong interactions will be independent of the heavy flavor and spin . in this case ,",
    "heavy - light mesons , the eigenstates of the qcd lagrangian in the heavy quark limit , can be labeled according to the total angular momentum @xmath19 of the light degrees of freedom .",
    "heavy mesons with the same @xmath19 but different spin orientations of the heavy quark fill into one doublet . accordingly",
    ", heavy mesons can be classified by these doublets , characterized by @xmath19 instead of the commonly - used quantum numbers , @xmath20 .",
    "the classification scheme based on the heavy quark symmetry applies to the @xmath21 mesons .",
    "for instance , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be arranged into the lowest - lying doublet with @xmath24 . among the p - wave @xmath25 states ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 belong to the doublet with @xmath28 , and doublet @xmath29 can be filled by @xmath30 and @xmath31 . despite some controversies over their internal structures , these mesons have been well established in experiment .",
    "several other resonant signals have also been observed recently on the @xmath32 factories and other facilities .",
    "the selex collaboration reported one narrow state @xmath33 in 2004  @xcite , which however , has not been confirmed so far by other experiments .",

    "the strong decays of @xmath0 are also investigated in the @xmath45 constituent quark model  @xcite and chiral quark model  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the verification of the above new states can be via not only the analysis of their decay properties , which have been widely discussed in the literature , but also via their productions , which so far have not been investigated in detail .",
    "the production processes of the above mentioned new states in @xmath46 decays would be an ideal way of probing their properties .",
    "productions of @xmath13 and @xmath15 in the @xmath46 decays have received some theoretical attentions  @xcite . on the experimental side , a large number of @xmath46 events will be collected by the lhcb  @xcite and forthcoming super b factory experiment  @xcite . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the degrees of freedom over the @xmath47 scale in @xmath46 decays can be computed in the perturbation theory and the evolution between the @xmath48 and @xmath47 can be organized using the renormalization group .",

    "this may also imply that our results for @xmath53 are reliable .",
    "results in the factorization method  @xcite are also close to our results but the perturbative qcd predictions  @xcite are typically smaller . for instance , the central value of the perturbative qcd result of @xmath209 is smaller than our result by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "our uncertainties are from the form factors , i.e. , from the quark masses and the shape parameters .",
    "uncertainties in the perturbative qcd approach shown in table  [ tab : br - nonleptonic - comparison ] are from three sets of input parameters : ( 1 ) decay constants of @xmath210 gev ( in ref.@xcite ) or @xmath211 gev ( in ref.@xcite ) , and the shape parameters of the @xmath46 wave functions @xmath212 gev ; ( 2 ) the factorization scale ( from 0.75 t to 1.25 t not changing the transverse part ) and the hadronic scale @xmath213 gev ; ( 3 ) the ckm matrix elements @xmath214 and @xmath215 . among them ,",
    "the hadronic inputs are found to give the largest uncertainties , while the ones from ckm are the smallest .",
    "for instance , the branching fraction of @xmath216 with these three kinds of errors is given as @xmath217    uncertainties in the pqcd approach are larger than our results for several reasons .",
    "* compared with the @xmath218 adopted in this work , the uncertainty in their computations is larger by a factor of 2 . * in the pqcd approach , the @xmath46 wave function has such a property that the decay constant can be factorized out and then @xmath218 is only the normalization constant of the wave functions . in the pqcd approach , the authors have independently estimated these two uncertainties and added them together as their final results .",
    "on the contrary , in the covariant lfqm the decay constant can not be factorized , but has been expressed as a convolution form as shown in eq .  .",
    "in this case , only the decay constant is the origin for the uncertainties , which will be smaller . *",
    "the uncertainties caused by factorization scales and hadronic scales in the pqcd approach characterize higher order qcd corrections and can be viewed as the model - dependent errors ( or systematic errors ) .",
    "they are smaller than but still in similar magnitude with the ones from the @xmath46 wave functions .",
    "one particular type of model - dependent uncertainties in this quark model concerns the zero - mode contributions .",
    "a direct evaluation of the form factors in the light - front quark model suffers from the non - covariance problem .",
    "it is resolved with the inclusion of the zero - mode contributions , i.e. the z - graph as in the conventional lfqm , and the direct treatment of the spurious terms with the replacement rules as in the covariant lfqm .",
    "different results can be produced .",
    "however , at present such computation in the conventional light - front quark model is not available .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to estimate the systematic errors",
    ".    in @xmath191 decays with a pseudoscalar meson emitted , the decay amplitudes only involve the form factor @xmath219 .",
    "the large form factors for the @xmath201 and @xmath66 result in large brs .",
    "similarly , the large uncertainty for @xmath220 also gives large uncertainties to the brs .",
    "channels with the emissions of @xmath221 and @xmath174 are suppressed by roughly one order of magnitude compared with the case emitting a pion and @xmath44 meson .",
    "this is due to the hierarchy in ckm matrix elements : @xmath222 , the branching fractions @xmath11 and @xmath12 can reach the order of @xmath5 .",
    "but the modes with the emissions of @xmath223 and @xmath224 are smaller by 1 to 2 orders .",
    "nevertheless , all of these channels have a promising prospect on the lhcb experiment with sufficient statistics for the @xmath46 production .",
    "using the covariant light - front quark model , we have studied the @xmath127 form factors , including the @xmath51 form factors as a byproduct .",
    "the form factors are computed in the space - like region and extrapolated to the physical region through a three - parameter form .",
    "those form factors are used to predict the semileptonic and nonleptonic @xmath46 decays . in particular , the predictions on branching fractions , longitudinal polarization fractions and the angular asymmetry , are provided .",
    "our results for @xmath51 decays are consistent with the experimental data for the @xmath46 and @xmath32 decays which are related by the flavor symmetry . for @xmath53 , we find that the branching fractions are large enough to be observed on the lhcb experiment .",
    "for instance , the brs of semileptonic @xmath225 , nonleptonic @xmath226 , and @xmath227 can reach the order of @xmath5 . in spite of similar production rates ,",
    "the different assignments for the @xmath0 can be distinguished by the polarization fractions and angular asymmetries .",
    "we expect more experimental results from the @xmath32 factories and lhc etc in the near future",
    ". they would be helpful to provide deeper insights into the @xmath1 spectroscopy .",

    "when performing the @xmath116 integration one needs to includes the zero - mode contribution to solve the noncovariance problem .",
    "this amounts to performing the integration in a proper way in the covariant lfqm  @xcite .",
