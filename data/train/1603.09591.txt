    "starless cores are the immediate precursors to the formation of protostars : small - scale overdensities within a molecular cloud which will , if gravitationally unstable , collapse to form an individual star or system of stars @xcite . not all starless cores will go on to form protostellar systems .",
    "the gravitationally - unstable and collapsing subset of starless cores are known as prestellar cores @xcite . barring external disruption , an individual stellar system will form from a prestellar core .",
    "understanding the properties of starless cores is essential to understanding the stars which will one day form from them ; recent studies have shown an apparent link between the core mass function and the intial mass function ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .    there is a paucity of analytic and semi - analytic evolutionary models for starless cores .",
    "historically , the singular isothermal sphere model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) has been used .",
    "however , the dynamical instability of this model was noted by @xcite , and more recent high - resolution observations have shown that starless cores have a non - singular geometry , typically with a flat central plateau ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "frequently - used starless core geometries include the plummer density distribution @xcite , which was first applied to starless cores by @xcite , and the bonnor - ebert ( be ) density distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the be density distribution is parameterised by its central density and characterised by a plateau of slowly decreasing density at small radii and a power - law decrease at large radii , and which treats a core as an isothermal , self - gravitating , polytropic sphere bounded by external pressure .",
    "at least some starless cores appear to be well - characterised by a be density distribution @xcite , and the be critically - stable mass of a starless core is often treated as a proxy for virial mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the be model requires the lane - emden equation to be solved numerically , and so modelling the evolution of a bonnor - ebert sphere remains the preserve of computational astrophysics ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "starless cores have been shown to be confined by external pressure in many cases ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found a population of virially - bound starless cores in the ophiuchus molecular cloud , for which external pressure significantly dominates over gravity in core confinement .",
    "it is not clear whether a virially bound and pressure - confined starless core will evolve to become gravitationally unstable .",
    "scenarios can be envisaged in which a core will contract under pressure until it becomes self - gravitating , or alternatively , where the core will contract to virial equilibrium with its surroundings .    in this paper",
    "we construct a model for the quasistatic evolution of a spherically - symmetric pressure - confined starless core .",
    "we consider two fully analytic solutions to this model : ( 1 ) a truncated plummer - like density distribution ( which produces a density profile similar to that of a bonnor - ebert distribution ) and ( 2 ) a truncated gaussian density distribution . the model is intended to assess whether an observed starless core is likely to evolve to become gravitationally unstable , or to virial equilibrium with its surroundings .",
    "we model cores in the non - magnetic and magnetised cases .",
    "the non - magnetic model has six initial parameter conditions , all of which are observable quantities : mass , size , temperature , internal velocity dispersion , external velocity dispersion and external density .",
    "the magnetised case introduces a seventh observable initial condition , magnetic field strength . in this paper , we assume negligible accretion of mass onto the core . in a subsequent paper , we will consider the case in which a core can continue to accrete mass .    the model presented in this paper",
    "is envisaged as a means by which the likely evolutionary outcome  gravitational collapse , or virial equilibrium  of an observed starless core can be rapidly assessed , without the need for computationally expensive simulations to be performed .    in section 2",
    "we formulate the model . in section 3",
    "we consider plummer - like and gaussian density profiles . in section 4",
    "we discuss core stability as a function of radius and construct evolutionary tracks in the virial plane . in section 5",
    "we discuss the cases of adiabatic and isothermal core contraction . in section 6",
    "we discuss the parameterisation of non - thermal motions . in section 7",
    "we discuss the parameterisation of the magnetic field . in section 8",
    "we apply this model to the starless cores identified in the l1688 region of the ophiuchus molecular cloud by @xcite . in section 9",
    "we discuss our results , and in section 10 we summarise our conclusions .",
    "we first present the general case of the model , without specifying a core geometry .",
    "we model a starless core as having a spherically - symmetric density distribution which is a continuous function of radius @xmath0 , defined by a central density @xmath1 and a characteristic size scale @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a monotonically decreasing function which obeys the limits @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the core is bounded by external pressure at a density of @xmath7 at a radius @xmath8 ( where @xmath8 is a function of @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) .",
    "material at radii @xmath9 is considered to belong to the core , and obeys the density relation given in equation  [ eq : density ] .",
    "material at radii @xmath10 is considered to belong to the surrounding cloud , and has a constant density @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the density profile of the system is given by @xmath11 note that while we have assumed that this function is continuous across the boundary at @xmath8 ( i.e. @xmath12 ) , there is no requirement in the model for this to be the case .",
    "the mass of the core  i.e. the mass enclosed in the radius @xmath8  is given by @xmath13",
    "we assume that the mass of the core remains constant throughout its evolution .    for a given characteristic radius @xmath2 , and assuming a fixed enclosed mass @xmath14 and bounding density @xmath7 , equation  [ eq : mass ] can be solved for central density @xmath1 , and hence for bounding radius @xmath8 .",
    "we thus construct the functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the behaviour of central density @xmath1 and bounding radius @xmath8 as a function of characteristic radius @xmath2 , respectively .    in this work , we consider two cases in which equation  [ eq : mass ] has an analytic solution . however , this method could be generalised to non - analytic core geometries .      in section  [ sec :",
    "density ] , we showed that given our specifications for a core s density profile , for a given mass and bounding density , the bounding radius and central density of the core can be expressed as functions of characteristic radius only .",
    "we consider the virial stability of the core as a function of characteristic radius , in order to determine whether the core is likely to contract or expand .",
    "contraction is defined as a decrease in the _ characteristic _ radius @xmath2 , while expansion is defined as an increase in characteristic radius @xmath2 .",
    "note that this does not necessarily equate to identical behaviour in the bounding radius @xmath8 .",
    "we assess the stability of the core against contraction or expansion by estimating the magnitude of each of the terms in the virial equation .",
    "we consider the virial equation in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the second derivative of the moment of inertia @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the internal energy , @xmath21 is the gravitational potential energy , @xmath22 is the magnetic energy , and @xmath23 is the energy due to external pressure acting on the core . if @xmath24 , a core s net energy is negative , and hence the core is virially bound .",
    "conversely , a core with @xmath25 will be virially unbound , and the virially stable mass of a core is the mass at which @xmath26 .",
    "we consider the virial stability of a core using the ratio @xmath27 where a ratio value @xmath28 indicates that the core is virially bound , a value @xmath29 indicates that the core is virially unbound , and a value of 1 indicates that the core is virially stable .",

    "@xmath35 can be estimated from the ideal gas law : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean line - of - sight ( one - dimensional ) gas velocity dispersion in the material surrounding the core .",
    "we assess the balance of confining forces  whether the core is confined by external pressure , or by self - gravity  with the ratio @xmath38 where a ratio @xmath28 indicates that the gravitational potential energy of the core is greater than the external pressure energy ( i.e. the core is gravitationally confined ) , and a ratio @xmath29 indicates that the external pressure energy is greater than the gravitational potential energy ( i.e. the core is pressure - confined ) .",
    "the internal energy term in the virial equation is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the line - of - sight ( one - dimensional ) velocity dispersion for the mean gas particle in the core .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath40 obeys the relation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the one - dimensional line - of - sight thermal gas velocity dispersion , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the non - thermal gas velocity dispersion .",
    "we model the evolution of the thermal velocity dispersion with core radius in the limits of isothermal and adiabatic compression of the core material . in the isothermal case ,",
    "the thermal velocity dispersion is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the initial temperature of the gas in the starless core .",
    "( all variables subscripted with a ` 0 ' refer to the initial value of that quantity . )",
    "we assume @xmath47k , as being representative of the central temperature of a prestellar core ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    in the adiabatic case , we assume that the gas obeys the adiabatic equation of state , @xmath48 where @xmath49 , assuming the gas is diatomic . if the gas is ideal then @xmath50 , and the equation of state becomes @xmath51    we assume that turbulence dissipates as a core contracts , and that the non - thermal component of the linewidth decreases in a manner which obeys the @xcite relation between the size and non - thermal internal linewidth of a starless core , @xmath52 we discuss the validity of this assumption in section  [ sec : nonthermal ] .",
    "we further assume that there is no mechanism by which a core can increase its non - thermal velocity dispersion , as there is no mechanism for injecting turbulence into the system .",
    "thus , we parameterise the non - thermal linewidth as @xmath53 this is the only non - reversible parameter in our model .",
    "note that this simple functional form assumes that @xmath8 is a monotonic function of @xmath2 , i.e. that a core which has decreased in size and hence dissipated its turbulence will not subsequently increase in size again .",
    "this condition is true for the density profiles which we consider in this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] shows the key parameters of the model , for a generalised starless core density distribution with characteristic radius @xmath2 .",

    "starless cores are frequently modelled as having plummer - like density distributions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this model produces a density profile consistent with observations showing that starless cores typically have a flat central plateau and a power - law decrease in density at large radii ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the bounding radius @xmath8 is much smaller than the characteristic radius and the density contrast from the centre to the edge of the core becomes small , and so the gravitational potential energy tends toward the value it would take if the core were a uniform sphere of radius @xmath8 .",

    "is small because the source is small . at intermediate @xmath2 , @xmath23 increases , while @xmath21 falls off as shown in figure  [ fig : example]e , and so the core becomes pressure - dominated .",
    "@xmath23 continues to dominate at large @xmath2 , as the gravitational potential energy approaches that of a uniform sphere , and as @xmath23 increases with @xmath8 .",
    "the internal kinetic energy of the core stays approximately constant over a wide range of radii ( figure  [ fig : example]g ) .",

    "the behaviour of the plummer - like and gaussian core geometries diverge significantly only at small radii , as shown in figure  [ fig : example ] .",
    "this is due to a core with a gaussian density distribution being more centrally condensed than a core with a plummer - like density distribution . in both cases ,",
    "when characteristic radius @xmath2 is small the bounding radius @xmath8 is also small , but is significantly larger than the characteristic radius . at small radii",
    "the bounding radius of the plummer - like distribution is larger than that of the gaussian distribution , in order to conserve the mass enclosed @xmath14 while obeying a less centrally condensed density distribution .",
    "thus , the plummer - like distribution has a higher energy due to external pressure at small radii than the gaussian distribution , as @xmath88 ( see figure  [ fig : example]f ) .    for both density distributions the gravitational potential energy increases as @xmath2 becomes small , tending toward the value of @xmath21 would take if the core were infinite in extent .",

    "hence , the gaussian model becomes gravitationally dominated ( @xmath90 ) at larger values of @xmath2 than the plummer - like model ( compare areas shaded grey in figure  [ fig : hypothetical ] ) .",
    "however , the plummer - like model is more virially bound than the gaussian model at small - to - intermediate radii , due to the dependence of the external pressure energy of the core on bounding radius ( see figure  [ fig : hypothetical ] ) .    at small radii",

    "thus , in the gaussian model , the virial ratio in the adiabatic case may tend to a value @xmath96 ",
    "i.e. the core may be virially unbound  as @xmath2 becomes small ( see figure  [ fig : hypothetical]b ) .",
    "the increase in adiabatic internal kinetic energy at small radii is equivalent to an increase in core temperature , as the core heats as it collapses .",
    "this increase is shown in figure  [ fig : example]h , in which it can be seen that the gaussian model results in higher core temperatures at small @xmath2 than the plummer - like model .",
    "the gaussian model shows core temperatures @xmath97k at the smallest radii , while the plummer - like model shows a more physically plausible increase in temperature , up to @xmath98k .",
    "the physical relevance of quasistatic contraction of the core at the smallest radii is not certain .",
    "once a core is both virially bound and gravitationally dominated , the quasistatic model is unlikely to apply .",
    "however , in this case , the core is still expected to undergo further collapse . the simple model presented in this work is only justified over the range of characteristic radii which have been measured for starless cores , and may not be relevant at the smallest and largest radii .",

    "i.e. , we expect a core which occupies the grey - shaded regions of figure  [ fig : hypothetical ] to evolve toward smaller radii in all cases .",

    "such simulations typically assume that cores obey a bonnor - ebert density distribution , and typically involve the perturbation of a system which is initially in equilibrium ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is a somewhat different approach to our model , which considers cores as obeying a plummer - like density distribution , and models the evolution of cores which are initially in a non - equilibrium ( i.e. virially unstable ) state .",
    "@xcite modelled the evolution of an initially stable bonnor - ebert sphere undergoing a steady increase in external pressure , in order to study protostellar collapse induced by external compression .",
    "they found that while the compression of their core is slow ( i.e. when the external pressure on their core increases on a timescale much greater than the sound - crossing time of the core ) , the core evolves quasistatically . during the prestellar stage of the core s evolution the outer boundary of the core",
    "is pushed inward  qualitatively similar to the contraction of pressure - dominated and virially bound cores in our model  and a modest , approximately uniform , inward velocity field is set up .",
    "however , @xcite found that when cores are strongly compressed ( i.e. the external pressure increases on a timescale shorter than the sound - crossing time ) , a compression wave is driven into the core , leaving behind it an inward velocity field which can become supersonic if the core compression is strong enough . this is dissimilar to our model , which assumes quasistatic core evolution throughout .",

    "it must be emphasised that the core properties measured by @xcite and listed as initial conditions in table  [ tab : ics ] are substantially uncertain .",
    "the majority of the cores have virial ratios consistent at the 3-@xmath40 level with their being virialised , and the evolutionary tracks described above are accurate only if measurements of the core properties are precisely accurate .",
    "these evolutionary scenarios should be viewed as representative of a core with the described properties , rather than a prediction specific to the core being observed .",
    "in this paper we have presented an analytic model for the evolution of a starless core , based on seven observable quantities : mass , size , temperature , internal velocity dispersion , external velocity dispersion , external density and magnetic field strength .",

    "we considered the differences between adiabatic and isothermal contraction , and noted that cores contract more effectively under the assumption of isothermal contraction than under adiabatic contraction .",
    "however , we note that our model is not physically justified at the extremely small characteristic radii at which the adiabatic and isothermal virial ratios differ significantly .",
    "we discussed the variation in the virial ratio introduced by varying the index of the larson relation , and found that varying the larson index in a physically reasonable range does not substantially alter our results .",
    "we discussed the magnetic field strengths necessary to alter the energy balance of a starless core , and found that the magnetic energy must be @xmath169% of the non - thermal kinetic energy for its contribution to the energy balance to be appreciable , and @xmath170% to significantly alter the energy balance of the core .",
