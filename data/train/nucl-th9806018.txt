    "explosive stellar burning of hydrogen in the mass a@xmath320 range is characterized by a large number of proton capture reactions and @xmath4-decays .",
    "the resulting network of nuclear processes is called the rp ",
    ". this process might be responsible for the energy production and nucleosynthesis in a variety of astrophysical sites with different temperature and density conditions .",
    "for example , in novae , typical peak temperatures range from @xmath5 @xcite , with @xmath6 the temperature in gk . for x  ray bursts and accreting black holes the rp ",
    "process could take place at very high temperatures in excess of @xmath7=1 @xcite .",
    "stellar rates of several proton capture reactions relevant for the rp  process were estimated by wallace and woosley @xcite and by wiescher et al .",
    "recently , some of these rates were updated with new experimental information and improved theoretical models @xcite .    at low stellar temperatures t@xmath8@xmath90.1 the isotope @xmath0 mg",
    "is synthesized in the nena - cycle . under such conditions",
    "the @xmath4-decay of @xmath0 mg ( t@xmath10=11.3 s ) and the subsequent @xmath0na(p,@xmath11 ) reaction convert material back into @xmath12ne , giving rise to cycling of material in the nena mass range .",
    "if the stellar temperature is sufficiently high the proton capture reaction on @xmath0 mg becomes faster than the competing @xmath4-decay . in this case",
    "the reaction flow breaks out of the nena mass region and a whole range of heavier nuclei could be synthesized , depending on the temperature - density conditions and the duration of the astrophysical event .",
    "this scenario , for example , might be responsible for the synthesis of elements such as si , s and ar , which have been found to be overabundant in the ejecta of onemg novae @xcite .",
    "therefore , a quantitative estimate of the stellar reaction rate for @xmath0mg(p,@xmath1)@xmath2al is important in order to model the nucleosynthesis in the mass a@xmath320 range . at very high temperatures above t@xmath8=1",
    "the @xmath0mg(p,@xmath1)@xmath2al reaction is of minor importance , since the isotope @xmath0 mg is bypassed via the sequence @xmath13na(p,@xmath1)@xmath14mg(p , @xmath1)@xmath0al(p,@xmath1)@xmath2si(@xmath15)@xmath2al .",
    "the reaction rate for @xmath0mg(p,@xmath1)@xmath2al was previously estimated by wallace and woosley @xcite , and their calculation was based on a single resonance only .",
    "subsequently the reaction rate calculation was improved by wiescher et al .",
    "@xcite who considered three resonances and in addition a contribution from the direct capture process .",
    "the most recent estimate was published by kubono et al .",
    "these authors , who investigated the level structure of @xmath2al near the proton threshold by using the @xmath2mg(@xmath16he , t)@xmath2al charge - exchange reaction , based the reaction rate estimate on their experimentally determined @xmath2al excitation energies and spin - parity restrictions .",
    "we present a reanalysis of the @xmath0mg(p,@xmath1)@xmath2al reaction rate for several reasons .",
    "first , a recent experimental study of the @xmath2mg(@xmath16he , t)@xmath2al charge - exchange reaction was published by greenfield et al . @xcite .",
    "the excitation energies of proton threshold levels in @xmath2al measured by the two groups differ by about 3050 kev .",
    "this difference might change the resulting reaction rates appreciably .",
    "second , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite conclude that the analog assignments of the two lowest - lying proton threshold states in @xmath2al are still uncertain , resulting in large errors of the derived stellar reaction rates .",
    "third , the proton and @xmath1-ray partial widths of the resonances in question have never been measured .",
    "these quantities were crudely estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite by adopting ` typical ' single - particle spectroscopic factors and ` average ' @xmath1-ray transition strenghts from ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",

    "the proton capture cross sections on sd - shell nuclei are predominantly determined by summing the contributions from isolated resonances corresponding to unbound compound nuclear states and from the nonresonant direct capture ( dc ) process . in the following",
    "we briefly describe the method of calculating the resonant and nonresonant ( dc ) contributions to the stellar reaction rates .      for the reaction under consideration here the resonances are narrow and isolated .",
    "the resonant rate contribution can be calculated from resonance energies e@xmath17 and resonance strengths @xmath18 ( both in units of mev ) @xcite @xmath19 the resonance strength @xmath20 for a ( p,@xmath1 ) reaction is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the spins of the resonance and the target nucleus , respectively , and the total width @xmath24 is the sum of the proton partial width @xmath25 and the @xmath1-ray partial width @xmath26 .    the proton partial width @xmath25 can be estimated from the single  particle spectroscopic factor s and the single  particle width @xmath27 of the resonance by using  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the isospin clebsch  gordan coefficient .",
