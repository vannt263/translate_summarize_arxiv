    "many superconductors of wide interest and recent discovery , such as iron - based superconductors @xcite , mgb@xmath0 @xcite and cuprate superconductors @xcite , have in common an intrinsic material anisotropy , essentially uniaxial , arising from their crystal structure .",
    "the material anisotropy has a profound impact , among the others , on the vortex dynamics and on the related pinning phenomena .",
    "such properties have been much studied due to their importance both for unraveling the fundamental physics of the underlying superconductor and in view of technological applications @xcite . as an example , recently a great deal of effort have been devoted to the artificial tailoring of pinning on yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , through the introduction of defects of various geometries , which can introduce additional sources of anisotropy .",
    "i focus on the models for d.c . and a.c .",
    "electrical transport measurements in the linear regime in the mixed state , since this class of measurements is largely used in the study of vortex dynamics .",
    "the interplay between the material anisotropy and the preferential direction introduced by the magnetic field @xmath3 determines a non - straightforward relationship between the applied current density @xmath4 and the corresponding electric field @xmath5 . indeed , by applying with a arbitrary orientations @xmath4 and @xmath3 , the vortices move under the effect of the lorentz force @xmath6 and induce ( faraday s law ) an electric field @xmath5 which is in general not parallel to @xmath4 even in isotropic superconductors . in anisotropic superconductors , additionally ,",
    "in general vortices do not move parallel to the lorentz force , further turning away @xmath5 from the @xmath4 direction . as a consequence , the measured quantities , such as the flux flow , the campbell and the high frequency resistivities ( and their vortex counterparts , the vortex viscosity , the pinning constant and the complex viscosity ) , depend on the angles between @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the anisotropy axis .",
    "given the interest in studies with arbitrary orientations of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , and the versatility of the microwave techniques @xcite as tools for applying both in - plane and out - of - plane currents , a tensor representation and within it the accurate identification of the material intrinsic properties are needed .",
    "previous works addressed some aspects of the problem , such as : anisotropic flux flow in the pin - free d.c .",
    "regime @xcite ; pinning in non linear regimes in tilted fields , studied in the perspective of magnetization measurements @xcite ; two - dimensional anisotropic pinning with isotropic viscous drag and fixed magnetic field orientation @xcite ; coupling between anisotropic two - fluid currents and vortex motion , the latter described within an isotropic framework @xcite .    in this work i propose a generalized treatment , centered on the force equation for the vortex motion , referring to uniaxial anisotropic superconductors in the mixed state .",
    "both the material anisotropy and pinning , the latter limited to weak random point pins only , are considered and studied in various regimes for arbitrary angles between @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the anisotropy axis .",
    "i consider the purely dissipative free flux flow regime , the dissipationless pinned campbell , and the high frequency regimes , where dissipation and pinning effects are comparable and additional phenomena like vortex creep become relevant @xcite .",
    "the goal is to provide the tensor representation of both the vortex parameters and the vortex motion resistivities and to relate the intrinsic quantities to the experimentally measured quantities , also by commenting on the applicability to the various tensors of the well - known scaling laws for the angular dependence on the field orientation @xcite .",
    "moreover , in several examples the tensor expressions will be cast into expressions directly exploitable in the experiments and applied to analyze experimental data .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : electrodynamics_model ] , the electrodynamics model is recalled ; in section [ sec : rhoffi_scalinglaw ] the intrinsic flux flow tensor expression and the angular scaling laws are briefly recalled ; in section [ sec : fluxflowparameters ] the vortex viscosity , vortex mobility and flux flow resistivity tensors are computed starting from the vortex force equation ; in section [ sec : campbell ] the treatment is extended to the a.c .",
    "campbell regime , yielding the various pinning - related tensors ; in section [ sec : highfrequency ] high frequency regimes are studied , where both dissipation and pinning effects are taken into account , the latter including also thermal depinning / creep .",
    "sections [ sec : exp_campbell ] and [ sec : rhovm_examples ] are devoted to experimental aspects , providing examples of data analysis in the measurement of the pinning constant and of the high frequency resistivity , respectively .    throughout this manuscript ,",

    ", `` @xmath11 '' denotes a diagonal square matrix having diagonal scalar elements @xmath12 .",
    "here i recall the model which will be used in this manuscript as a general framework to describe the superconductor electrodynamics response in the mixed state , and as such applied to the various regimes studied .",
    "the starting point is the electrodynamics model proposed by hao , hu and ting in their study of the d.c .",
    "flux flow resistivity in anisotropic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the model holds in the linear regime in a homogeneous superconductor with an uniform magnetic field applied along a general direction , in the london limit .",
    "vortices are assumed to be straight and rigid flux lines moving in a uniform current field density .",
    "this basic model does not take into account more complex phenomena such as helical instabilities of the vortex lines @xcite , flux - line cutting effects @xcite , and breaking of vortex lines into pancakes in the extremely anisotropic , layered superconductors @xcite .",
    "accordingly , i do not consider any electric field component @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "when vortices move with velocity @xmath14 , they induce an electric field @xmath5 given by the faraday s law @xcite : @xmath15 this vortex motion determines a transport current @xmath16 , related to @xmath5 through the material conductivity tensor @xmath17 , so that , within the linear response theory @xcite : @xmath18 the tensor @xmath19 is the _ material intrinsic _ resistivity tensor : @xmath20 these tensors are a property of the superconductor material , they do not depend on the current intensity and orientation , and relate the current density @xmath16 and the electric field @xmath5 coupled by vortex motion .",
    "their specific expressions depend on the considered vortex motion regime : explicit expressions in various regimes will be given in the following sections .    in experimental measurements ,",
    "an externally imposed current @xmath4 sets in motion the vortices by exerting the lorentz force ( per unit length ) @xmath21 on the individual vortices .",
    "since @xmath4 can be in principle arbitrarily oriented , it will be in general distinct from @xmath16 , which is instead constrained to specific orientations with respect to @xmath3 ( i.e. the condition @xmath22 holds ) .",
    "the difference @xmath23 is a supercurrent density @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath25 ) @xcite uncoupled with vortex motion . since @xmath26 ,",
    "the _ experimentally measured _",
    "resistivity tensor @xmath27 , defined as : @xmath28 is different from @xmath29 . in particular , the widely used scalar resistivity @xmath30 measured along the direction of the applied current @xmath4 is related to @xmath27 as follows : @xmath31 with a bit of algebra , the relation between the intrinsic resistivity tensor @xmath29 and the experimentally measured @xmath27 can be worked out . for a diagonal @xmath29 , one obtains : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , being @xmath34 the permutation ( levi - civita ) tensor @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that while the elements of the tensor @xmath27 can be ( by definition ) directly measured by properly choosing the direction of the applied @xmath4 and of the measured @xmath5 component , the same does not hold in general for the elements of the intrinsic @xmath29 tensor which , on the other hand , is the physical quantity of interest .",
    "therefore it becomes necessary to determine @xmath29 from measurements of @xmath27 by paying attention to the removal of the additional `` spurious '' contributions present in the latter , as it will be illustrated in the remaining part of this paper and in particular in the sections [ sec : exp_campbell ] and [ sec : rhovm_examples ] .",
    "the explicit expression for the intrinsic tensor @xmath35 in the flux flow regime has been previously derived @xcite .",
    "i follow reference @xcite which , working within the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory ( @xmath36 ) , accounts for both ohmic losses and order parameter relaxation .",
    "i first specify the frame of reference .",
    "the crystallographic axes are taken as the coordinate axes of a cartesian frame of reference , having coordinate unit vectors @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , so that @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , being the latter the axis of the uniaxial anisotropy",
    ". the chosen frame of reference , together with a magnetic induction field vector with general orientation @xmath43 , is depicted in figure [ fig : ref ]",
    ".     is also depicted , applied along a general direction at the polar @xmath44 and azimuthal @xmath45 angles.,width=151 ]    in this frame of reference the phenomenological electronic mass tensor @xcite , which can be used to describe in the london limit the material anisotropy , is diagonal : @xmath46 having defined the in - plane mass @xmath47 , the out - of - plane mass @xmath48 , the anisotropy factor @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the mass tensor @xmath51 contains all the information concerning the material anisotropy , since the only source of anisotropy that will be considered is the effective mass of the charge carriers ( this implies , for example , that the possible anisotropy of the scattering time of the normal carriers is neglected ) . by neglecting the hall contribution and assuming the same anisotropy axes for the normal resistivity and mass tensors @xmath52 ( i.e. the mass tensor is the only source of anisotropy also for the normal state ) , the tensors @xmath35 and @xmath53 are _ diagonal _ in the stated frame of reference : @xmath54 where @xmath55 . neglecting the weak field dependence of @xmath56 one obtains @xcite : @xmath57 which shows that all the three tensor elements of @xmath35 share the same field dependence through a common function @xmath58 and that the common field dependence is consistent with the scaling laws @xcite , widely observed and experimentally studied @xcite .",
    "the blatter - geshkenbein - larkin ( bgl ) formalization of the scaling law @xcite states that in the london approximation , a thermodynamic or intrinsic transport property @xmath59 of a uniaxially anisotropic superconductor depends on the applied field intensity @xmath60 and angle @xmath44 through the scaled field @xmath61 as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the angular - dependent anisotropy parameter , @xmath64 is the field - dependent quantity in the equivalent isotropic superconductor , and the scaling factor is typically @xmath65 . from this rule one obtains readily @xmath66 . for @xmath67 ,",
    "as it happens for @xmath68 , one has @xmath69 , i.e. the anisotropic physical quantity in the mixed state depends on the @xmath70 ratio only ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the scaling approach holds also in presence of point pins , but not with other pin geometries like extended defects . in this work",
    "the eventual adherence to the scaling law of the various anisotropic quantities will be commented , given its usefulness as a tool to identify the intrinsic ( charge carrier mass ) material anisotropy , including also the effect of point pins , as opposed to other eventual extrinsic sources of anisotropy , such as extended defects .",
    "equation can be rewritten as : @xmath72 the above equation highlights the important property that the field magnitude and angular dependence of the whole intrinsic flux flow resistivity tensor can be represented by a single scalar function , namely the element @xmath73 , which adheres to the angular scaling law .",
    "similarly , the conductivity tensor is @xmath74 .    in the following , for ease of notation",
    "the field magnitude and angular dependence will be explicitly written only in the equations reporting the main results .      in this section the well - known vortex force equation @xcite , involving the balance of forces ( per unit length ) acting on an individual vortex ,",
    "is studied in the regime of pure flux flow : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the viscous drag force and @xmath77 is the viscous drag , also known as viscosity , tensor .",
    "experimentally , this regime can be obtained when pinning is very low @xcite , with d.c .",
    "currents sufficiently large to overcome the pinning forces @xcite , or with a.c .",
    "currents at high enough frequencies @xcite .",
    "the issue of the true d.c .",
    "current path is of paramount importance by itself , and it has to be solved separately @xcite . in any case , it has to be kept in mind that the actual realization of the flux flow regime requires specific conditions and care @xcite .",
    "the following computations yield a generalized formulation which provides ( i ) the vortex viscosity @xmath77 and the related vortex mobility @xmath78 tensors ; ( ii ) the relationship between @xmath77 and the flux flow resistivity tensors @xmath35 and @xmath79 ; ( iii ) the basis for the extension of the tensor - based treatment to a.c . regimes with pinning ( sections [ sec : campbell ] and [ sec : highfrequency ] ) .",
    "starting from the force equation and working within the above recalled electrodynamics model , with straightforward calculations one obtains : @xmath80 where @xmath81 has been introduced for the sake of compactness .",
    "it can be noted that the viscosity tensor @xmath77 does not obey the angular scaling law and that it depends also on @xmath45 , even if the superconductor is uniaxially anisotropic , because of the faraday - lorentz contribution included in @xmath82 . for symmetry of notation ,",
    "an `` intrinsic '' viscosity tensor can be introduced as follows : @xmath83 in the last member , it is shown that @xmath84 satisfies the angular scaling law with @xmath85 .",
    "equation can be thus rewritten as : @xmath86 contrary to @xmath84 and @xmath53 , the viscosity tensor @xmath77 is not diagonal .",
    "nevertheless it can be diagonalized by finding its eigenvectors @xmath87 @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and corresponding eigenvalues @xmath91 so that in the new frame of reference @xmath92 $ ] the viscosity tensor @xmath93 is @xcite : @xmath94 as a particular case , it can be checked that the present expression of the tensor @xmath77 yields the same ( eigen)values of the viscosity along the principal axes as those reported in @xcite , computed within the bardeenstephen @xcite model .",
    "since @xmath95 and @xmath96 are @xmath97 , the force equation implies that for both of them there exists a current direction @xmath98 yielding a right - handed orthogonal basis @xmath99 $ ] in which @xmath100 , so that the resistivity tensor is effectively represented by a single scalar value . having taken @xmath3 in the @xmath101-@xmath102 plane for ease of notation and without loss of generality , these current directions are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and",
    "are drawn in figure [ fig : fieldcurconf ] , in the right and left panel respectively .",
    "the configuration on the left panel of figure [ fig : fieldcurconf ] is the well - known and widely used `` maximum lorentz force '' setup .",
    "the other one is , among other possible geometries @xcite , seldom used in the experiments , because it requires samples grown with the c - axis parallel to the sample surface @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , its usefulness will become apparent through its use in the study of the campbell pinning regime proposed in section [ sec : campbell ] .",
    "the force equation can be written in terms of the vortex mobility tensor @xmath78 as : @xmath105 since the vortex viscosity tensor has rank=2 ( equation ) , @xmath78 can not straightforwardly be derived as the inverse of @xmath77 , as the relation between the corresponding scalar quantities would suggest . nevertheless , in the plane @xmath106 , @xmath78 is the inverse bijection of @xmath77 whereas the vortex mobility for the ( physically not existing ) lorentz force component @xmath107 can be safely set @xmath108 .",
    "hence : @xmath109      the flux flow resistivity tensor @xmath79 can be now expressed in terms of the vortex mobility @xmath110 . starting from equation one obtains , after a little algebra : @xmath111 it is of paramount importance that equation represents the _ measured _ , _ apparent _ , flux flow resistivity tensor , _ different _ from the material intrinsic flux flow resistivity tensor .",
    "the relation between the material @xmath35 , the measured @xmath79 and the vortex viscosity tensor @xmath112 can be made explicit resorting to equation and considering that @xmath113 : @xmath114 ^ 2}\\ ] ] using equations the role of @xmath35 emerges : @xmath115 it can be checked that the above equation is equivalent to equation , written with @xmath116 .",
    "it can be noted that @xmath79 , like the viscosity tensor @xmath77 of equation and contrary to @xmath35 , does not obey the angular scaling law .",
    "the above expressions relating the measured resistivity tensor to the vortex parameters are an important result of this paper since they enable the computations performed in the following sections , devoted to the study of a.c .",
    "a totally different limit with respect to flux flow is given by the pinning regime .",
    "there , the d.c .",
    "response is zero .",
    "however , the a.c .",
    "resistivity is well measurable ( @xcite and references therein ) . to my knowledge , no complete treatment of the anisotropic resistivity in the pinning regime exists . in this section",
    "i consider the vortex motion under a.c .",
    "currents flowing in anisotropic superconductors with random point pinning centers , described in the weak collective pinning regime @xcite .",
    "in particular , i focus on the well - known campbell regime , in which the pinning action on vortices dominates over the dissipative viscous drag and the pinning force is proportional to the small displacement @xmath117 of the vortices from the pinning centers .",
    "the above two conditions are achieved respectively for frequencies smaller than the so - called pinning frequency ( of the order of a few mhz in conventional superconductors @xcite and of several ghz in high-@xmath118 superconductors @xcite , mgb@xmath0 @xcite , low-@xmath118 thin films @xcite and more complex superconducting heterostructures @xcite ) and for currents small enough to ensure the validity of the linear regime .",
    "considering only point pins ( i.e. zero - dimensional pinning centers ) ensures that no further preferential directions are introduced in the superconducting system , in contrast with what happens when extended ( e.g. linear or planar ) defects are present .",
    "the starting point is the force equation written in the sinusoidal regime @xmath119 , including the pinning force and neglecting the viscous drag ( hence neglecting losses ) : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the pinning constant ( also called labusch parameter ) tensor , @xmath122 and @xmath4 is a ( low - frequency and small intensity ) a.c .",
    "no creep phenomena are considered .",
    "the corresponding so - called campbell resistivity is purely imaginary and written as , in isotropic superconductors : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the campbell penetration depth @xcite .",
    "going back to anisotropic superconductors , it is evident that the force equation in the campbell regime is formally equivalent to the force equation written for the pure flux flow regime .",
    "hence , by applying the general electrodynamics model recalled in section [ sec : electrodynamics_model ] and exploiting the subsequent computations of section [ sec : fluxflowparameters ] , it is straightforward to introduce the series of tensors @xmath125 $ ] which are analogous to the already studied @xmath126 $ ] . therefore the following expressions can be obtained :    [ eq : pinningtensors ] @xmath127    where the latter expression holds for a diagonal @xmath128 , as it will be taken in the following .",
    "the above equations do not give a complete model in the campbell regime , since an explicit expression for the campbell tensor @xmath128 of the material is still needed .",
    "whereas in the flux flow regime the computation of @xmath35 was addressed by the tdgl treatment @xcite , the determination of the tensor @xmath128 will be addressed in the following section .",
    "i assume that @xmath128 is diagonal like @xmath35 : since it can be easily checked that , when @xmath129 is parallel to a coordinate axis , the pinning tensor @xmath121 is diagonal if and only if @xmath128 is diagonal , this ensures that choosing @xmath3 and @xmath4 along two coordinate axes , the corresponding pinning force @xmath130 ( and vortex velocity ) will be parallel to the third coordinate axis , as it is reasonable to expect .",
    "this assumption leaves the diagonal elements , @xmath131 and @xmath132 within the uniaxial anisotropy , to be determined .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath133 , which is the resistivity that can be experimentally measured with @xmath134 ( equation ) and @xmath135-@xmath102 plane ( i.e. the well - known `` maximum lorentz force '' configuration ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath132 is not directly accessible through real experimental current - field configurations ( as it can be shown with a little algebra exploiting the expressions which relate @xmath27 to @xmath29 )",
    ". therefore it must be _ indirectly _ determined through coupled , complementary measurements .",
    "i choose @xmath136 ( already used for the above determination of @xmath131 ) and @xmath137 , related to the two field - current configurations commented in section [ sec : viscosity ] and depicted in figure [ fig : fieldcurconf ] .",
    "hence one obtains :    [ eq : rhoc_i ] @xmath138    according to section [ sec : viscosity ] , both the field - current configurations `` ( x ) '' and `` ( @xmath139 ) '' correspond to eigenvectors of @xmath14 , and hence of @xmath140 . the pinning force @xmath141 is then completely described by a single scalar value , the eigenvalue of the pinning constant @xmath142 ( denoted @xmath143 and @xmath144 for the two configurations , respectively ) .",
    "the definition allows to write down the following : @xmath145 the explicit expressions of the pinning constants are determined as follows .      by simple physical arguments @xcite , for an isotropic superconductor one can evaluate the pinning constant @xmath146 by equating the maximum pinning force @xmath147 acting on a vortex , where @xmath148 denotes the action range of the pinning centers , with the maximum lorentz force @xmath149 exerted when the current equals the critical current density . since for core - pinning @xmath150 , i.e. the coherence length defining the radius of the vortex core , one can write : @xmath151 where @xmath152 .    for anisotropic superconductors",
    ", equation must be specialized for the two current configurations `` ( x ) '' and `` ( @xmath139 ) '' used in equation .",
    "the pinning constant @xmath143 [ @xmath144 ] describes the pinning action on vortices moving along the @xmath139 [ @xmath154 direction under the action of a current @xmath155 [ @xmath156 : hence the critical current density @xmath157 [ @xmath158 , and @xmath159 [ @xmath160 , i.e. the coherence length along the direction @xmath139 [ @xmath154 of the vortex movement . therefore : @xmath161 one should note that @xmath144 , despite being referred to a current - field configuration of difficult realization in the experiments , is related to quantities ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) which can be expressed within available theories . in this sense",
    ", equation gives a tool for subsequent elaborations .",
    "indeed , the above equations can be further developed using the bgl scaling law results @xcite .",
    "the current densities @xmath164 and @xmath162 for point - pinning in the single vortex and small - bundle pinning regime ( the scaling theory does not describe the large bundle pinning regime , appearing in the highest field and temperature regions ) are given by the following scaling expressions @xcite :    [ eq : scalingjc ] @xmath165    where the full expression of @xmath166 is reported in reference @xcite for the different pinning regimes .",
    "it is worth stressing that the critical current @xmath166 ( and the corresponding @xmath167 ) for the equivalent isotropic superconductor is not angle - dependent because point pins only are considered , whereas extended pinning centers would introduce preferential directions and therefore angle - dependent quantities even in an isotropic superconductor .",
    "geometrically , the quantities @xmath168 and @xmath169 represent the maximum distances between the displaced vortex and the point pin @xcite :    [ eq : scalingxi ] @xmath170    where @xmath171 denotes the in - plane coherence length .    by using equations and in equation",
    ", one can write :    [ eq : kp_jc_xy2 ] @xmath172    it is worth stressing that , thanks to equation : @xmath173 hence the in - plane pinning constant @xmath174 obeys the scaling law given by equation .      using equations , and , one obtains :    [ eq : rhocscaling ] @xmath175    therefore , similarly to @xmath35 of equation , one can write : @xmath176 this is an important result of this paper : the explicit expression of @xmath177 ( and the related @xmath178 given below ) for point pinning has been obtained , showing that the anisotropy of the pinning tensors and the flux flow tensors is the same and is completely described by the mass anisotropy tensor . moreover , both @xmath35 and @xmath128 satisfy the same angular scaling law @xmath179 .",
    "this result is very important also in the study of high frequency regimes ( sections [ sec : highfrequency ] and [ sec : rhovm_examples ] ) where both losses and pinning phenomena are equally relevant .",
    "lastly , recalling equation , the `` intrinsic '' pinning constant tensor can be written down : @xmath180 where @xmath181 and where the last member highlights the scaling law satisfied by @xmath178 .",
    "finally , the experimentally measured pinning constant tensor is : @xmath182 and it does not scale because of the additional contribution given by @xmath82 .",
    "in this section i provide an example showing the additional information which can be gained using the results of the present work by performing an analysis of experimental data .",
    "various techniques can be used to explore the campbell regime , including inductance measurements @xcite , a.c .",
    "linear susceptibility measurements @xcite and the vibrating reed technique @xcite .",
    "the pinning constant can be also determined through microwave measurements @xcite , which requires more extended models dealt with in section [ sec : highfrequency ] . in the following ,",
    "i focus on a.c .",
    "linear susceptibility measurements on yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 samples in the mixed state , performed by varying both the direction and the intensity of the applied d.c . magnetic field .",
    "the source of the experimental data is reference @xcite , where full details about the experiment can be found .",
    "the measured squared real part of the penetration depth @xmath183 ( @xmath184 is the london penetration depth ) is related to the squared campbell penetration depth @xmath185 which , given the geometry of the experiment , is @xmath186 .",
    "the examined sample are two twinned yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals , one irradiated at 30@xmath187 with respect the @xmath188-axis in order to create columnar defects capable of reinforcing the pinning properties and one , virgin , used as reference . as a consequence , four sources of pinning",
    "are expected : point pins and three types of correlated pinning centers , namely the twins along the @xmath188-axis direction , the @xmath189-@xmath190 planes and the columnar defects at 30@xmath187 ( in the irradiated sample only ) .",
    "it was concluded that pinning was stronger with the field aligned with columnar defects and , from a qualitative analysis , that an enhancement of pinning existed even far from the track direction .",
    "i show in the following that such findings can be put on solid quantitative grounds by exploiting the present model .",
    "in particular , i will use the model developed in the previous section to remove the anisotropic response due to the material anisotropy and to point pins , which can give rise to a significant angle - dependent contribution possibly obscuring the angle - dependent contributions arising from correlated defects .    here",
    "i consider the data taken from figure 5 of reference @xcite for the irradiated sample only , where @xmath191 measured at various angles @xmath44 at t=@xmath192k is reported . in order to extract @xmath193",
    ", i extrapolate @xmath194 , take it as an evaluation of @xmath195 and , by neglecting pair - breaking effects , estimate @xmath196 .",
    "then the pinning constant @xmath197 is obtained , using equation with @xmath198 . by dividing by @xmath199 ( i.e. the maximum value attained by @xmath200 in the whole @xmath201 and @xmath44 range considered )",
    ", the normalized @xmath202 is free from geometrical factors .",
    "the result is reported in figure [ fig : labusch]a .",
    "the process of acquiring the @xmath191 data from the original plot , extrapolating @xmath191 to @xmath203 and subsequently inverting @xmath204 , the latter being a quite small quantity for small fields especially for @xmath205 and @xmath206 , is prone to a certain degree of uncertainty .",
    "hence for each angle @xmath44 two curves are reported , delimiting the uncertainty area originated by the spread of the @xmath194 values . as a rough estimation of the spread",
    ", the range of values obtained by using a variable number ( @xmath207 ) of low field data points of @xmath208 for the linear extrapolation to @xmath203 is used . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "the so - obtained @xmath209 is also shown ( inset of figure [ fig : labusch]a ) , compared with the line representing a @xmath210 field dependence which would yield a constant @xmath146 .",
    "it should be noted that the larger uncertainty ( confined to low fields ) and the hump obtained at low fields for the @xmath205 data are of no consequence for the subsequent discussion , since the latter is focused on the data for @xmath211 and @xmath212 , which are less uncertainty - prone due to their larger @xmath208 .    by inspecting figure [ fig : labusch]a",
    ", it can be seen that the pinning constant in the irradiated sample with @xmath3 along the columnar defects ( @xmath205 ) is larger than along the other directions . moreover , by examining the curves with @xmath211 and @xmath212 , it was noted @xcite that , despite being very similar at low fields , the two curves depart at near half the matching field @xmath213oe .",
    "thus , it was inferred @xcite that the defects still determined an appreciable contribution to pinning even for the field tilted at @xmath211 , 60@xmath187 far from the tracks directions .     vs @xmath201 , with continuous line showing a @xmath210 dependence for reference .",
    "data digitized from reference @xcite as reported in the text.,width=321 ]    actually , this observation can be further substantiated by resorting to the result of section [ sec : campbell ] , namely equation : were only point pinning present , the in - plane pinning constant at different fields and angles should scale so that by plotting @xmath214 vs @xmath61 all the curves should overlap .",
    "any possible residual difference between the scaled curves should then be ascribed to the effects of correlated defects only , since the scaling removes the background effect of point pinning centers .",
    "the result of such scaling is reported in figure [ fig : labusch]b , where @xmath215 has been used ( taking @xcite @xmath216 does not change the result ) .",
    "it can be seen that , even by having removed the effect of point pins , along the tracks directions pinning remains the largest . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute values for @xmath211 are now larger than those for @xmath217 .",
    "since at these angles the contribution of twins and @xmath189-@xmath190 planes can be neglected ( see also figure 2 in reference @xcite ) , one can infer that at @xmath211 the artificial defects still reinforce pinning , yielding a higher pinning constant than the one measured at @xmath217 .",
    "this result further substantiates , on quantitative grounds , the observation done on qualitative grounds , i.e. based on the field dependence , reported in the original work @xcite .",
    "in this section i address the determination of the vortex motion resistivity tensor @xmath218 in a general vortex motion regime in which both viscous drag and pinning effects are in action . in order to introduce all the relevant quantities ,",
    "i first recall the general models describing the high frequency vortex dynamics with reference to the commonly studied configuration of isotropic superconductors with @xmath219 ( section [ sec : scalarmodel ] ) .",
    "second , i develop the full treatment for uniaxially anisotropic superconductors ( section [ sec : acforceequation ] ) . then , some examples of data analysis based on the obtained results will be illustrated in section [ sec : rhovm_examples ] .",
    "the scalar force equation describing the vortex motion in an isotropic superconductor with isotropic ( point ) pinning and @xmath219 is , in the sinusoidal regime @xmath119 @xcite : @xmath220 where @xmath221 is a stochastic thermal force causing thermal depinning ( vortex creep ) .",
    "different approaches @xcite , with different ranges of applicability @xcite , have been proposed to take into account creep effects . as an illustration ,",
    "i follow here the description of thermal depinning in terms of the relaxation of the pinning constant @xmath222 ( reference @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic time for thermal activated depinning is : @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the inverse of the ( de)pinning angular frequency @xmath225 ( which will be commented on later ) and @xmath226 is the activation energy .",
    "equation can then be rewritten as @xcite : @xmath227 where the complex viscosity @xmath228 has been introduced : @xmath229 the corresponding scalar vortex motion resistivity is : @xmath230 where the characteristic angular frequency @xmath231 is : @xmath232 and the creep factor @xmath233 is : @xmath234 for @xmath235 the creep is negligible , @xmath236 and @xmath237 ; consequently the vortex motion resistivity becomes : @xmath238 this limit corresponds to the gittlemanrosenblum ( gr ) model @xcite . from equation",
    "it can be seen that the pinning angular frequency @xmath239 marks the transition between a `` low frequency '' and a `` high frequency '' regime : for @xmath240 the pinning force dominates over the viscous drag , yielding @xmath241 , while for @xmath242 , a purely dissipative flux flow regime is recovered with @xmath243 yielding the same behaviour as in d.c . with no pinning .    before concluding this short review , it is worth recalling the definition of the often used dimensionless ratio",
    "@xmath244 @xcite : @xmath245 which , if creep is negligible ( gr limit ) yields : @xmath246 the @xmath244 parameter can be directly computed from the complex resistivity @xmath247 and it is unaffected by any systematic error in the experiments .",
    "physically , it allows to easily evaluate whether the vortex dynamics is in the pinning dominated ( @xmath248 ) or flux flow dominated ( @xmath249 ) regime .",
    "the force equation in anisotropic superconductors including both viscous drag and pinning , momentarily neglecting vortex creep ( treated later ) , can be written as : @xmath250 which , by defining the complex viscosity tensor as : @xmath251 can be recast in : @xmath252 it is evident that the force equation is formally equivalent to force equations written for the flux flow and campbell regimes ( equations and , respectively ) .",
    "hence , it is straightforward to apply the previous results to the series of quantities @xmath253 $ ] . as a first result , within this framework one can write : @xmath254 equations and allow to write down : @xmath255 substituting equations and into yields : @xmath256 it is evident that @xmath257 inherits the angular dependencies and anisotropic properties from @xmath84 and @xmath178 , represented by @xmath51 and by the scaling law .",
    "i stress that , in obtaining equation , i have used a very important result for the analysis of the experiment , namely : @xmath258 which holds for @xmath259 , i.e. for all the principal axes directions .",
    "the above equation shows that , contrary to the viscosity or the pinning constant , the pinning frequency is a scalar ( using a gr model for the interpretation of the data , the same applies to the @xmath244 parameter ) .",
    "together with the scaling property of @xmath239 highlighted in the last member , this fact implies that , whichever orientation is set for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the vortex system will always have the same pinning frequency at fixed @xmath70 .",
    "this property suggest a straightforward method to check whether directional defects influence vortex motion . by plotting @xmath239 vs the scaled field @xmath70 , any deviation from a scaling curve",
    "should indicate the influence of some directional effect other than the material anisotropy , since if extended pins are present equation does not hold .",
    "the material intrinsic conductivity and resistivity tensors are : @xmath260 using equation , the explicit expression for @xmath261 can be written down : @xmath262 this is another important result of this work : similarly to @xmath257 , @xmath261 retains the same anisotropy of the flux flow and pinning tensors , given by the mass anisotropy tensor @xmath51 alone . moreover , it satisfies the same angular scaling law , shown in the last equality , as @xmath35 and @xmath128 .",
    "it is important to remember that @xmath261 of equation is not directly measured , whereas the actually measured tensor is : @xmath263\\ ] ] from equation it can be noted that , contrary to @xmath261 , the measured tensor @xmath264 does not obey the angular scaling law , since it incorporates additional angular dependencies through @xmath265 .",
    "now i include the effects of flux creep .",
    "the pinning energy @xmath226 depends only on the magnetic field magnitude and direction and not on the direction of vortex motion .",
    "moreover , it obeys the usual scaling law ( with a constant scaling factor @xmath266 @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the thermal depinning time @xmath267 ( equation ) is a scalar @xmath268 .",
    "the pinning constant tensor of equation can thus be modified to include creep as : @xmath269 consequently , the scalar vortex motion resistivity with flux creep , equation , can be generalized to the anisotropic case as follows , yielding an expression analogous to equation : @xmath270 where the characteristic frequency @xmath231 and the creep factor @xmath233 remain scalar values as in the isotropic case , reported in equations and .",
    "this property will prove important in the interpretation of the experiments .",
    "it is worth stressing that the choice of the pinning constant relaxation as a model for flux creep @xcite is not a limiting factor to the results obtained up to now : in fact , any pure thermal creep process ( independent on the angle between the field and the current ) , possibly with a different definition of @xmath233 and @xmath231 ( reference @xcite ) , would yield the same results .",
    "in this section i consider explicitly some typical experimental configurations and i derive specific expressions relating measured and material intrinsic quantities .",
    "it should be noted that at microwaves the electromagnetic response of the superconductor is not only dictated by the motion of the vortices but arises from the coupling between the latter and the high frequency currents , which include both the normal and the superconducting components @xcite .",
    "moreover , the actual physical quantity that can be directly measured is not the local complex resistivity , but the superconductor surface impedance @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of the present results in the calculation of the full electromagnetic response ( in terms of the local complex resistivity and anisotropic surface impedance ) is outside the scope of this paper and thus postponed to a future work . in the following ,",
    "the contribution of the coupled microwave currents will be neglected and the superconducting material will be assumed to be in the form of thin film , a sample geometry widely used in microwave experiments @xcite . in these conditions it can be shown that @xmath218 , being essentially proportional to the surface impedance tensor , can be taken as the actually measured quantity .      a straight a.c .",
    "current can be applied to flat thin films resorting to resonators having rectangular geometries @xcite . considering @xmath134 and using the resistivity tensor given by equation ,",
    "the measured vortex resistivity is computed by applying equation :    [ eq : rhoeff_exp4 ] @xmath271    i recall that @xmath45 is the angle between the projection of the @xmath3 field on the @xmath272-@xmath101 plane and the @xmath272 axis ( figure [ fig : ref ] ) . it can be seen that the effective , measured vortex motion resistivity consists in the product of two terms : the first is the resistivity @xmath273 only , which in particular obeys the angular scaling law ; the second one , denoted in the equation as @xmath274 , is an additional angular dependence which arises from the faraday and lorentz actions .",
    "consequently , as already anticipated commenting the whole tensor @xmath218 , the experimentally measured quantity does not obey the scaling law , and therefore care must be taken in isolating the intrinsic material property from the contribution given by the experimental setup before proceeding with the physical interpretation of the data . only in the case",
    "@xmath275 ( i.e. the maximum lorentz force configuration ) , @xmath276 and one has direct , experimental access to the intrinsic vortex resistivity @xmath273 .      a rotational symmetric planar geometry is often used for measurements of the vortex - state microwave response .",
    "examples are cylindrical resonators @xcite , in which ( using cavity perturbation techniques @xcite ) the superconducting sample is located on the circular bases , and the so - called corbino disk setup @xcite , in which the superconducting sample short - circuits an open - ended coaxial cable . in both cases ,",
    "rotational symmetric currents ( circular and radial for the resonator and the corbino disk , respectively ) are induced along the superconductor @xmath189-@xmath190 plane ( see figure [ fig : rotcurrents ] ) , in the frequent case in which the superconductor @xmath188-axis is perpendicular to its surface .",
    "is the angle between the ( local ) current density @xmath4 and the @xmath272 axis.,width=321 ]    the actually measured @xcite resistivity comes out as an angular average @xcite over the current pattern : @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the angle between the ( local ) current density @xmath4 and the @xmath272 axis ( see figure [ fig : rotcurrents ] ) . exploiting the uniaxial anisotropy together with the circular symmetry of the current pattern",
    ", the computation can be equivalently and more simply done by averaging equation over all possible values of @xmath45 : @xmath279 the result is :    [ eq : rhoeff_exp53 ] @xmath280    where @xmath281 is the average of @xmath282 over all the @xmath45 values .",
    "the same comments proposed for equation hold also here .",
    "moreover one can note that , in the present case , if @xmath283 equation still yields a scaling law @xcite .",
    "however , in the interpretation of the experiments one has to be careful and not confuse this artificial scaling function with the theoretical scaling expression .",
    "it is interesting to note that a typical gr model analysis in a isotropic superconductor extracts the vortex parameters @xmath284 , @xmath244 and @xmath146 from the complex measured @xmath285 of equation as follows : @xmath286 \\\\    r & = \\frac{{\\operatorname{im}}(\\rho_{v})}{{\\operatorname{re}}(\\rho_{v } ) } \\\\",
    "k_p & = \\frac{r}{\\rho_{{\\it ff}}}\\omega b \\phi_0 = \\omega b \\phi_0 \\frac{{\\operatorname{im}}(\\rho_{v})}{{\\operatorname{re}}^2(\\rho_{v})+{\\operatorname{im}}^2(\\rho_{v})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , when performing measurements on an anisotropic superconductor probed with rotational symmetric current patterns leading to equation , this computation would yield the following _ effective _ quantities ( apart from the additional @xmath45-dependence , the same holds for the straight current setup of equation ):    [ eq : rhogr3 ] @xmath287    it can be seen that the parameter @xmath288 is directly obtained from the measured quantities : this is an interesting result , which allows a direct evaluation of the material anisotropy of the system without the need to deal with lorentz - dependent contribution @xmath281 . on the other hand , both @xmath289 and @xmath290 show an additional angular dependence through @xmath281 .",
    "therefore , in the analysis of angular data care must be devoted in correctly extracting the intrinsic quantities instead of the effective ones : this requires to evaluate in some way the @xmath281 function , which in turn requires the knowledge of the anisotropy factor @xmath291 .",
    "further comments can be done considering a scaling analysis performed starting from the effective quantities of equation . once the intrinsic quantities @xmath292 and",
    "@xmath244 are extracted , they can be checked against the scaling prescription .",
    "if @xmath292 is found to satisfy the scaling , and in the same time @xmath244 or , equivalently @xmath293 , is not , this result would unambiguously indicate the presence of directional pinning contributions such as extended defects .",
    "this type of analysis is performed in references @xcite , where it enabled the accurate extraction of the intrinsic anisotropy of bazro@xmath1 added yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 thin films , the unambiguous identification in the angular dependent pinning constant of extended pinning acting effectively at microwave regimes , and the identification of a mott - insulator effect through a comparative study with d.c .",
    "@xmath294 measurements .",
    "the electrodynamics model for transport measurements in the mixed state in uniaxial anisotropic superconductors has been discussed in various regimes , namely the dissipative free flux flow regime , the dissipationless low frequency pinned campbell regime and the high frequency regime , where dissipation and pinning effects are comparable and thermal depinning / creep appears .",
    "arbitrary orientations between the applied field , the applied current and the anisotropy axis have been considered .",
    "vortex parameters , like the viscous drag , the vortex mobility and pinning constant , have been derived in tensor form for arbitrary field orientations . it has been shown that the tensors describing point pinning share the same structure of the flux flow tensors , and that the measured quantities , differently from the corresponding intrinsic quantities , in general do not satisfy the angular scaling laws . a full tensor model for the a.c .",
    "vortex motion resistivity , including creep , pinning and flux flow , has been presented .",
