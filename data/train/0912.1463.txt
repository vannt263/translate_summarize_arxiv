    "properties of strongly correlated quantum matter are usually well described by the many - body ground state and by the first elementary excitation .",
    "multiparticle excitations are often not important because they just constitute an incoherent background .",
    "thus , the study of quantum phase transitions mainly relies on low - energy spectrum analysis , namely energy levels of the ground state and the first excited state @xcite .",
    "however , in various systems , bound states may arise and play a major role .",
    "one of the most famous example are cooper pairs which lead to superconductivity but other electron systems also display such mechanism ( see , for instance , refs .  ) . in one - dimensional magnetic systems ,",
    "well - known examples are the dimerized and frustrated spin chain as well as the two - leg spin ladder @xcite which contains bound states made up of triplons .",
    "interestingly , such modes have been experimentally observed in cuprate ladder materials @xcite . in two dimensions , the frustrated shastry - sutherland model and its experimental realization srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0",
    "are also known to possess two - triplon bound states @xcite .",
    "note that more complicated bound states may arise in topologically ordered systems where anyons ( semions ) can bind to form bosons or fermions as discussed in ref .  .",
    "recently , such binding effects have been studied in the two - dimensional xxz model @xcite where elementary excitations are dressed magnons .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze the spectrum of such magnon bound states in two different spin systems .",
    "the first one is the ferromagnetic transverse - field ising model ( tfim ) on the square lattice for which we derive the two - magnon spectrum perturbatively in the small - field limit .",
    "the high - order series expansion ( order 12 ) of the corresponding gap allows us to extrapolate its behavior near the critical point where it is found to vanish .",
    "we also compute the ratio between the one - magnon gap and this two - magnon gap at the critical point which is approximately @xmath2 , in agreement with field - theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the second system considered in this study is the xxz model on the square lattice which , in the isotropic limit ( xxx ) , is the celebrated antiferromagnetic heisenberg model . as for the tfim , we focus on the two - magnon bound - states spectrum which is derived up to order 8 near the ising limit .",

    "and @xmath3 directions are denoted @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "thus , it is convenient to introduce the following hamiltonian that will also be the starting point of our study of the heisenberg model ( see sec .",

    "[ fig : ferro_2flip_far ] , antiferromagnetic bonds are represented as bold segments . ]",
    "of course , following the same line of reasoning , one can show that @xmath30-magnon bound states exist for any @xmath31 , but we shall restrict our study to the case @xmath32 .",
    "let us also notice that in the ordered phase , the perturbation is performed around the field term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamtfim ] ) , which basically counts spin flips , so that no binding effect is present in this limit .",

    "the heisenberg hamiltonian is then the @xmath37 limit of the following xxz hamiltonian @xmath38 where we have introduced the usual raising and lowering operators @xmath39 .",
    "the square lattice being bipartite , it is possible to perform a rotation of angle @xmath40 around the @xmath41 axis on one of the sublattices , namely @xmath42 .",
    "this transformation leads , without changing notations for the pauli operators and making use of @xmath27 defined previously , to @xmath43 we thus see that in the limit of a vanishing anisotropy parameter @xmath36 , @xmath44 reduces to @xmath27 so that the binding effects discussed above for @xmath45 are also at work here .",
    "the difference between both models is the perturbation term added to @xmath27 .",
    "let us finally mention that from the point of view of the xxz model , a second - order quantum phase transition occurs at the heisenberg point @xmath37 , separating a gapped phase for @xmath46 with a twofold - degenerate ground state with nel order from a gapless phase with o(2 ) symmetry for @xmath47 .",

    "[ sec : sub : tfim ] when describing the spectrum of @xmath27 , the energy cost of any multi - magnon state is given by the number of antiferromagnetic bonds of the state s spin configuration .",
    "it is thus natural , though not mandatory , to introduce effective spin variables living on the bonds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice2 ] ) as follows  : @xmath57 to make notations light , we denote bonds @xmath58 between two sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 with greek letters , such as @xmath9 in the above equation . a value @xmath59 or @xmath60 of @xmath61",

    "within such a description , hamiltonian ( [ eq : hami ] ) becomes a pure field term @xmath62 we can now give another form of the field term of @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath63 flips the spin at site @xmath6 , it flips the four bonds sharing site @xmath6 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath64 the set of these four bonds ( the notation @xmath50 referring to stars or vertices of the original lattice ) .",

    "then , the tfim hamiltonian reads @xmath67 in the same vein , we can rewrite the xx part of the xxz hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamxxz_1 ] ) . from expression ( [ eq : hamxxz_3 ] ) , it is clear that this xx term flips two adjacent spins , if these two spins are in a ferromagnetic configuration while it annihilates antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "we recall that in eq .",

    "one argument in favor of the former scenario is that , for any finite - size system , the ground state of the su(2)-invariant heisenberg point is a singlet and the gapped elementary excitation is a threefold degenerate triplet , with total magnetization @xmath237 .",
    "the excitations with @xmath238 can be identified with one - magnon excitations found for @xmath239 , whereas the excitation with @xmath240 has to be a two - magnon bound state .",
    "the gap of these excitations should furthermore vanish in the thermodynamical limit considered in the present pcuts study .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ sec : sub : symm_count ] , the toric code hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamtfim_mapped ] ) deserves to be analyzed on its own . indeed , in the original toric code model @xcite , kitaev focused on the isotropic coupling @xmath242 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamtc ] ) for notations ] . here , the bond description of the tfim leads us to consider a different situation where ( _ i _ ) @xmath243 and ( _ ii _ ) a magnetic field in the @xmath88 direction is introduced .",
    "let us stress that such a model is very close to the xu - moore model @xcite and , in some sense , very similar to the parallel - field problem discussed in refs .   and .",
    "most importantly , it is exactly the model introduced by wegner in his seminal paper @xcite ( see also ref .  ) but , here , @xmath186 operators are conserved quantities that can be in any configuration .",
    "this crucial difference raises several questions that we shall address in the present section .",
    "let us first rewrite the hamiltonian and various operators of sec .",
    "[ sec : sub : symm_count ] in the toric code language .",
    "the hamiltonian reads    @xmath244    where the spins live on the bonds of a square lattice ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lattice3 ] ) and the @xmath245 operators involve the four sites around a vertex @xmath50 .",
    "the plaquette operators @xmath246 are conserved . for a system defined with periodic boundary conditions the cycle operators @xmath247 defined on diagonal or antidiagonal contours , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice3 ] , are conserved as well .    )",
    "is defined with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "sites are represented with dots .",
    "we also show a vertex @xmath50 , a plaquette @xmath76 , a diagonal contour @xmath54 , and an antidiagonal contour @xmath55 , used to define various operators ( see text ) . ]",
    "the main difference with the xu - moore hamiltonian @xcite is that @xmath248 operators only act on vertices of the square lattice and not on plaquettes .",
    "furthermore , in the xu - moore model , the cycle operators are still conserved , contrary to the @xmath186 operators .",
    "the dynamics of the quasiparticles is thus expected to be more constrained than in the xu - moore model which already exhibits dimensional reduction .    in the following",
    ", we shall discuss separately the two limits ( large and small @xmath249 ) for which we computed perturbatively the low - energy spectrum .",
    "one can already note that in the small - field limit , the system is in a topological phase ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , the ground - state degeneracy depends on the surface genus ) whereas at large field the ground state is obviously unique .",
    "thus , one expects a ( topological ) quantum phase transition when varying the ratio @xmath249 .      for @xmath251 ,",
    "elementary excitations are usual magnons obtained by flipping any spins from the ground state which is the state fully polarized in the field ( @xmath88 ) direction . pcuts formalism will then give a dressed magnon description when switching on @xmath18 @xcite . setting @xmath252 , the ground - state energy per bond ( which coincides with the 0qp level )",
    "is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gse_tfim ] ) by replacing @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "however , for this model , arbitrary qp sectors are allowed although conservation of @xmath186 s imposes severe constraints on the spectrum . for @xmath253 , one only has a nondispersive ( excited ) level at energy @xmath254 since any displacement of this localized dressed magnon would modify the @xmath186 s configuration .    for @xmath255 ,",
    "the only possible dynamics is provided by some flip - flop processes depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics_2qp ] ( we do not consider the case where the two dressed magnons are far apart ) . both configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics_2qp ] yield the same gap , which reads @xmath256 note that in the xu - moore model , the pair of nearest - neighbor magnons ( top of fig .  [ fig : dynamics_2qp ] ) is allowed to hop at any distance ( but in a one - dimensional stripe ) @xcite .    ) .",
    "dressed magnons are depicted as crosses .",
    "the @xmath257 and @xmath258 signs refer to the eigenvalue @xmath59 or @xmath60 of the plaquette operators @xmath186 . ]",
    "we have not computed energies of states with more magnons .",
    "let us simply mention the following two points .",
    "for @xmath259 , the problem is similar to @xmath255 and no dynamics of the qps is allowed apart from flip - flip processes .",
    "the first dispersive mode is the one involving four magnons , just as in the xu - moore model @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the opposite limit where @xmath18 is much larger than @xmath17 and for which the system is in a topological phase . for convenience ,",
    "let us set @xmath261 .",
    "since the @xmath186 operators do not appear in the hamiltonian , all states are macroscopically degenerate when @xmath23 .",
    "it is thus natural to wonder what the effect of the perturbation is . a calculation at fourth order of the effective hamiltonian in the sector where there is no effective vertex excitation ( still using the pcuts formalism ) yields    @xmath262    where @xmath70 is the number of sites ( and thus twice the number of plaquettes or of vertices ) .",
    "we thus see that , once the magnetic field is switched on , the ground state belongs to the sector where each operator @xmath186 has eigenvalue @xmath59 . as a check ,",
    "note that setting all @xmath186 operators to one in the above formula gives the ground - state energy , which matches with eq .",
    "( 8) of ref .",
    "( apart from a trivial constant shift since no @xmath186 operator appears in our hamiltonian , and after setting @xmath263 to zero in this equation ) .",
    "the fact that the sector with no plaquette excitation is selected by the perturbation is consistent with an ising - type quantum phase transition . indeed , in this sector , the model with hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamtcf ] ) is dual to the two - dimensional transverse - field ising model ( which follows from the same arguments as those used in ref .  ) .",
    "we have studied two - magnon bound states in the tfim and xxz models using pcuts around the ising limit .",
    "this method gives a nice physical picture of these excitations in terms of dressed magnons which can be of two kinds on a square lattice depending on the `` frustrated bond '' localizing it ( horizontal or vertical ) .",
    "consequently , one obtains two different bound modes contrary to previous claims @xcite . for both systems , we find that the lowest - energy gap vanishes at the critical point , or at least in a neighborhood that can not be distinguished from this point with actual series expansions . solving this issue , especially for the xxz model , would clearly require much higher orders or a nonperturbative treatment as the one considered in refs .   and for the tfim .    from a methodological point of view",
    ", we have adapted entings finite - lattice method commonly used in statistical mechanics to quantum problems .",
    "this approach basically consists in a cluster embedding which considerably increases the efficiency ( from the time and memory point of view ) of the pcuts method we used here .",
    "note that for the xxz model , such an improvement allowed us to reach the same maximum order as standard series expansions techniques ( see refs .   and ) based on a more sophisticated graph analysis .",
    "clearly , adapting such a graph description to pcuts is a crucial issue which is currently under study and should allow one to reach higher orders .",

    "the corresponding hopping amplitudes @xmath178 of @xmath6 sites in @xmath41 direction and @xmath7 sites in @xmath3 direction are given below .",
    "hopping amplitudes that are not given can be deduced from the symmetries of the lattice and the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
