    "according to a finding by bondi and gold ( 1950 ) the magnetic multipole moments which result from electric currents in a perfectly conducting fluid occupying a simply connected body can not grow boundlessly .",
    "they remain for any fluid motion within bounds determined by the initial magnetic flux through the surface of the body . in a simple spherical mean  field dynamo model of @xmath0type proposed by krause and steenbeck ( 1967 )",
    ", however , the magnetic field grows endlessly both inside and outside the fluid body even in the limit of perfect conductivity .",
    "this conflict has been resolved in a more sophisticated model by rdler ( 1982 ) that properly considers the specific structure of the mean electromotive force resulting from the constraints on the fluid motion at the boundary of the body .",
    "it was shown analytically that this structure indeed ensures the boundedness of the magnetic multipole moments and thus excludes an infinite growth of the magnetic field outside the fluid body in the high  conductivity limit . however , the question remained open whether or not a dynamo may work inside the fluid body , which then would have to be invisible , or hidden , in the sense that its magnetic field is completely confined inside this body .",
    "only a few arguments were given which support the conjecture that such a dynamo may exist .    in between the issue of the adjustment of a dynamo in the high  conductivity limit to the constraints posed by the bondi and gold theorem",
    "was also addressed in papers by hollerbach , galloway and proctor ( 1995 and 1998 ) .",
    "they considered a dynamo in a spherical fluid shell with a chaotic flow surrounded by insulating space inside and outside and demonstrated that it works also in the limit of high conductivity , in which then the magnetic field in the insulating spaces vanishes .    in the present paper",
    "we return to the mean  field model proposed by rdler ( 1982 ) .",
    "after a few short explanations concerning the case of high conductivity and the mean  field concept in dynamo theory ( sections 2 and 3 ) and the simple model by krause and steenbeck ( 1967 ) ( section 4 ) we deliver a systematic treatment of our model and present numerical results giving evidence for the existence of a hidden fast dynamo in the above sense ( section 5 ) .",
    "finally we discuss a few conclusions ( section 6 ) .",
    "we consider here dynamo models consisting of an electrically conducting fluid occupying a simply connected region surrounded by free space .",
    "let us assume that the magnetic flux density , @xmath1 , is governed by the induction equation @xmath2 inside the fluid body , continues as a potential field @xmath3 in outer space and vanishes at infinity . as usual",

    "the real part @xmath9 of @xmath8 is the growth rate of @xmath1 .",
    "we speak of a dynamo if there is at least one solution @xmath1 with a non  negative @xmath9 .    for many applications to cosmic objects",
    "the limit of high electrical conductivity , that is @xmath10 , deserves special interest . to define this limit more precisely ,",
    "let us measure all length in units of @xmath11 being a typical scale of @xmath4 or @xmath1 , and the time in units of @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being a typical magnitude of @xmath4",
    ". then ( [ i1 ] ) applies with @xmath5 replaced by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the magnetic reynolds number defined by @xmath16 and the high  conductivity limit corresponds to @xmath17 .",
    "we mention two important aspects of dynamo action in the high  conductivity limit .",
    "to explain the first one we compare dynamos which differ only in the value of @xmath15 . if then the largest growth rate @xmath18 remains positive and takes a finite positive value as @xmath17 we speak of a fast dynamo , otherwise , that is , if @xmath18 tends to zero or to a negative value , of a slow dynamo .",
    "the second aspect is that in the case of perfect conductivity , @xmath19 , the magnetic field has to satisfy the requirements posed by the theorem by bondi and gold ( 1950 ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we suppose the fluid body to be a sphere and formulate this theorem as proposed by rdler ( 1982 ) .",
    "we use spherical coordinates @xmath20 and represent the potential @xmath21 introduced with ( [ i2 ] ) in the form @xmath22 with spherical harmonics @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are associated legendre polynomials .",
    "the @xmath26 are complex constants satisfying @xmath27 which define multipole moments , e.g. , those with @xmath28 the dipole moment , with @xmath29 the quadrupole moment etc .",
    "depending on the motions at the boundary of the fluid body the @xmath26 may vary in time . according to the theorem by bondi and gold , however , they are bounded in the sense that @xmath30 with @xmath31 given by the initial distribution of the magnetic flux at the boundary .",
    "this in particular excludes any exponential growth of the @xmath26 .",
    "a third aspect which concerns the conditions to be satisfied by @xmath1 at the boundary will be discussed below .",
    "in cases in which the magnetic field and the fluid motion are of turbulent nature , or show by other reasons complex structures in space or time , the mean  field approach to dynamo models has proved to be useful ; see , e.g. , krause and rdler ( 1980 ) . in this approach both the magnetic flux density @xmath1 and the fluid velocity @xmath4 are considered as a sum of a mean field , @xmath32{0mm}{8.2pt}}}}}$ ] or @xmath33 , defined by a proper averaging procedure , and a fluctuating part , @xmath34 or @xmath35 . provided that the reynolds averaging rules apply",

    "one of the simplest mean  field dynamo models , which can be treated analytically , has been proposed by krause and steenbeck ( 1967 ) .",
    "the fluid body is supposed to be a sphere of radius r , again surrounded by free space .",
    "any mean motion of the fluid is ignored , @xmath53 , and thinking of homogeneous isotropic turbulence the electromotive force @xmath37 is taken in the form ( [ i13 ] ) with constant @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "specifying now equations ( [ i10 ] ) to this case we write simply @xmath1 instead of @xmath32{0mm}{8.2pt}}}}}$ ] and use @xmath54 and @xmath55 as units of length and time . looking then for solutions @xmath1 varying like @xmath56 with @xmath57 we may reduce these equations to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a dimensionless measure of the @xmath45effect , @xmath60 in this model equation ( [ i15 ] )",
    "was completed by the requirements that @xmath1 is continuous across the boundary and has the structure given by ( [ i2 ] ) and ( [ i4 ] ) in outer space .",
    "the problem posed in this way has been investigated for axisymmetric @xmath1fields by krause and steenbeck ( 1967 ) for the steady case and by voigtmann ( 1968 ) for the time ",
    "dependent case . a detailed treatment of the general case including non  axisymmetric time ",
    "dependent fields is given in krause and rdler ( 1980 ) .",
    "we only mention here a few particular results .",
    "there are independent solutions @xmath1 which possess the form of single multipole fields , that is dipole fields , quadrupole fields etc . in outer space . in all cases",
    "@xmath8 is real , it takes a negative value for @xmath61 and increases monotonously with @xmath62 , runs through zero for some marginal value of @xmath62 and behaves like @xmath63 as @xmath64 . comparing all these solutions we find the smallest marginal value for a solution of dipole type . denoting this value by @xmath65 we have @xmath66    consider now the high  conductivity limit .",
    "then the condition of dynamo action resulting from ( [ i16 ] ) and ( [ i17 ] ) takes the form @xmath67 .",
    "it seems well possible to satisfy this condition , that is , the dynamo may well work in this limit .",
    "the dimensional growth rate is then given by @xmath68 .",
    "since in the case of a dynamo with growing magnetic fields @xmath8 must be positive , this growth rate is positive too , that is , we have a fast dynamo .",
    "the structure of the magnetic field depends , if its multipole character is specified , only on the value of the parameter @xmath59 irrespective of that of @xmath5 .",
    "the field is non ",
    "zero both inside and outside the fluid body , and this can not change as @xmath10 . if a dynamo works and the field grows exponentially in time then the @xmath26 introduced with ( [ i4 ] ) do so , too .",
    "this , however , is in conflict with the bondi  gold theorem .",
    "one of the shortcomings of the model considered so far , which might be the reason for this conflict , is the assumption of an electromotive force @xmath37 in the form ( [ i13 ] ) with constant @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which can be justified for homogeneous isotropic turbulence only . near the boundary of the fluid body",
    "the turbulence must necessarily deviate from homogeneity and isotropy , and @xmath37 has to take a more complex form . as already mentioned , in a paper by rdler ( 1982 ) a modified model was studied with a spherically symmetric distribution of the turbulence .",
    "then the radial direction necessarily occurs as preferred direction in the turbulence and therefore we have a more complex form of @xmath37 . it was shown that with this modification the conflict is resolved . more precisely , with these assumptions any growth of the magnetic field at the boundary of the fluid body or in outer space can be ruled out .",
    "turning now to this model we assume again that the mean magnetic flux density @xmath32{0mm}{8.2pt}}}}}$ ] is governed by equations ( [ i10 ] ) in a spherical fluid body @xmath69 and continues as a potential field as given by ( [ i2 ] ) , or ( [ i4 ] ) , in the outer space @xmath70 .",
    "we further exclude any mean motion , @xmath43 , and specify the electromotive force @xmath37 in accordance with a spherically symmetric turbulence . for the sake of simplicity we write in the following again @xmath1 instead of @xmath32{0mm}{8.2pt}}}}}$ ] , and @xmath4 instead of @xmath35 , and we rely again on spherical coordinates @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "spherical symmetry of the turbulence is understood here in the sense that all averaged quantities determined by the @xmath4field are invariant under arbitrary rotations of this field about arbitrary axes through the center @xmath73 of the fluid body . from this definition",
    "we may conclude by standard reasoning ( see , e.g. , krause and rdler ( 1980 ) ) that the electromotive force @xmath37 must have the form @xmath74 with scalar coefficients @xmath75 determined by @xmath4 and depending on position only through @xmath76 but not through @xmath77 or @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath78 is the radial unit vector and @xmath79 the symmetric part of the gradient tensor of @xmath80 so that , if we refer to cartesian coordinates , @xmath81 . some more details concerning the derivation of ( [ m1 ] ) are given in rdler ( 1982 ) .",
    "if the turbulence is reflectionally symmetric about planes containing the center of the body @xmath82 and @xmath83 are equal to zero . in the case of homogeneous isotropic turbulence only the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be non  zero and the others have to vanish , so that we return to ( [ i13 ] ) .",
    "later we will also assume that the turbulence is steady , that is , that all averaged quantities depending on @xmath4 are invariant under shifts along the time axis . in this case",
    "the coefficients @xmath86 are independent of time .",
    "even if we accept again the second  order correlation approximation the calculation of the coefficients @xmath86 for points near the boundary of the fluid body is , at least for finite conductivity , rather complex .",
    "we note here only results for the high  conductivity limit , defined as above by @xmath87 , which were already obtained in a slightly different form by rdler ( 1982 ) . denoting the mentioned coefficients in this limit by @xmath88 we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 and analogous definitions of @xmath93 and @xmath94 . according to our assumptions the @xmath95 , like the averaged quantities under the integrals ,",
    "depend on @xmath96 via @xmath76 only .",
    "it seems natural to assume that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are non  negative everywhere . at the boundary of the fluid body we have @xmath99 and therefore @xmath100",
    "let us now represent the magnetic flux density @xmath80 as a sum of a poloidal and toroidal part , @xmath101 where @xmath102 , and expand the defining scalars @xmath103 and @xmath104 in series of spherical harmonics @xmath105 .",
    "it can easily be followed up that the equations and conditions governing @xmath1 imply no coupling between contributions to @xmath1 differing in @xmath106 or @xmath107 so that we may restrict ourselves to the simple solutions defined by @xmath108    due to the factor @xmath54 in ( [ r1 ] ) the dimensions of @xmath103 and @xmath104 coincide .",
    "preparing the definition of dimensionless quantities we introduce the constants @xmath109 and @xmath110 with the dimension of a velocity and a magnetic diffusivity .",
    "we will assume homogeneous isotropic turbulence in some central region of the fluid body and identify these constants with @xmath50 and @xmath51 given by ( [ i14 ] ) for this region .",
    "in the following we measure all lengths in units of @xmath54 , the time in units of @xmath111 , further the @xmath112 in units of @xmath109 , the @xmath113 in units of @xmath114 , the @xmath115 in units of @xmath110 , and @xmath116 in units of @xmath117 .    using standard methods",
    "we may then reduce equations ( [ i10 ] ) for @xmath1 to @xmath118 with @xmath119 @xmath120 and @xmath121    @xmath122    equations ( [ i2 ] ) for the outer space are equivalent with @xmath123 note that @xmath124 coincides with @xmath125 for the chosen @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "as a consequence of the divergence relation for @xmath1 its normal component and thus @xmath103 has to be continuous across the boundary @xmath126 . for finite conductivity of the fluid , that is @xmath127 , we may exclude surface currents so that the tangential components have to be continuous too , and so @xmath128 and @xmath104",
    ". together with ( [ r7 ] ) we may conclude that @xmath129 the original problem of the determination of @xmath1 occurs then as the problem of solving the equations ( [ r3 ] ) , completed by ( [ r6a ] ) and ( [ r6b ] ) , with the boundary conditions ( [ r8 ] ) .    in the case of perfect conductivity ,",
    "@xmath130 , again the continuity of @xmath103 has to be required .",
    "however , surface currents can no longer be excluded , which correspond to discontinuities of @xmath128 and @xmath104 .",
    "more precisely , such currents are given by @xmath131 { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\hat{r}$}}}\\x { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}}y_n^m   + [ t ] { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}}y_n^m $ ] ) , where @xmath132 means the magnetic permeability of the fluid and @xmath133 $ ] stands for @xmath134 .",
    "in this case the equations ( [ r3 ] ) have to be completed by conditions which we will formulate later .",
    "remaining with the case of infinite conductivity we first demonstrate , repeating the ideas described by rdler ( 1982 ) , that our model is compatible with the bondi  gold theorem . for this purpose",
    "we consider the first equation ( [ r3 ] ) , completed by ( [ r6a ] ) , for @xmath135 .",
    "putting there @xmath130 , inserting @xmath136 according to ( [ m2 ] ) and using ( [ m4 ] ) we find @xmath137 and hence @xmath138 remembering that @xmath139 and that @xmath140 is non  negative we see that ( [ i6 ] ) is indeed satisfied .",
    "we now turn our attention to the question whether in the limit of infinite conductivity magnetic fields can grow inside the fluid body .",
    "we rely on equations ( [ r3 ] ) to ( [ r7 ] ) , put @xmath130 and insert @xmath141 according to ( [ m2 ] ) . with the idea to have a model with a minimum of free parameters we choose simply @xmath142 with @xmath143 this corresponds to the assumption of homogeneous isotropic turbulence inside the spherical region @xmath144 and of inhomogeneous anisotropic turbulence in the surrounding shell @xmath145 .",
    "note that @xmath146 at @xmath126 and therefore ( [ m4 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "finally we assume that there is initially no magnetic field at the boundary of the fluid body , that is @xmath147 at @xmath126 .",
    "due to ( [ r9 ] ) we have then @xmath148 at @xmath126 at any time .",
    "starting from the second equation ( [ r3 ] ) together with ( [ r6b ] ) and using ( [ m2 ] ) , ( [ r12 ] ) and ( [ r13 ] ) we arrive at a relation for @xmath149 analogous to ( [ r9 ] ) from which we may conclude that also @xmath150 at @xmath126 at any time .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath1 is then governed by ( [ r3 ] ) , completed by ( [ r6a ] ) , ( [ r6b ] ) , ( [ m2 ] ) , ( [ r12 ] ) and ( [ r13 ] ) , and the role of boundary conditions is taken by @xmath147 at @xmath126 .",
    "( we note that the remarks concerning the boundary condition for @xmath103 in rdler ( 1982 ) , section 3.6 , are incorrect . )",
    "the problem posed in this way has been investigated numerically .",
    "there are indeed solutions @xmath1 , or @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which for sufficiently large @xmath151 grow exponentially in time .",
    "the growth rate @xmath8 introduced as above again proves to be real . the fastest  growing solution for a given @xmath151 is always one of dipole type , that is @xmath28 . we restrict our attention in this paper to such solutions and , furthermore , to the case @xmath152 .",
    "the dependence of the growth rate @xmath8 on @xmath151 is shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "clearly dynamo action is possible if @xmath153 with @xmath154    let us define an effective radius @xmath155 of our model by equating of @xmath156 to the value of @xmath65 for the simple model discussed above given by ( [ i17 ] ) , that    is @xmath157 . comparing this with the corresponding relation for the modified model under consideration , that is @xmath158",
    ", we find @xmath159 .",
    "this means that the shell with the fractional radius between @xmath160 and @xmath161 showing deviations from a homogeneous isotropic turbulence is less effective for dynamo action than the central region of the fluid body without such deviations .",
    "figures [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] show the radial distribution of the energy densities of the poloidal and the toroidal parts of the magnetic field and field pictures for two examples with @xmath162",
    ".    it would be interesting to study a sequence of dynamo models with positive @xmath163 approaching zero . in this context",
    "we must have in mind that @xmath163 occurs not only with the dissipation terms @xmath164 and @xmath165 in ( [ r3 ] ) .",
    "in addition the coefficients @xmath166 entering @xmath167 and @xmath168 via ( [ r6a ] ) and ( [ r6b ] ) depend on the magnetic diffusivity , that is , on a parameter proportional to @xmath163 .",
    "there are , however no results available which describe this dependence in the neighbourhood of a jump of the magnetic diffusivity as it occurs at the boundary .",
    "several numerical calculations have been carried out on the basis of equations ( [ r3 ] ) including the dissipation terms but using expressions for @xmath166 as given by ( [ m2 ] ) and ( [ m3 ] ) , that is , for infinite conductivity .",
    "of course , in these calculations the boundary conditions ( [ r8 ] ) have been used .",
    "indeed the solutions obtained in this way approach the corresponding ones with @xmath130 in a very satisfying manner as @xmath169 .",
    "the only difference occurs in the distribution of the electric currents near the boundary , what is understandable since for @xmath130 a part of them occurs as surface currents .",
    "it is interesting to observe how the magnetic energy concentrates itself more and more inside the conducting body as @xmath169 .",
    "table [ t1 ] shows for one example the dependence of the ratio of the energies @xmath170 and @xmath171 in the outer and in all space on @xmath163 .",
    "c@c + @xmath172 & @xmath173 +   + @xmath174 & @xmath175 + @xmath176 & @xmath177 + @xmath178 & @xmath179 +",
    "as already shown in an earlier paper by rdler ( 1982 ) , the mean  field model reconsidered here , in contrast to a more simplified one , meets the requirements posed by the bondi  gold theorem .",
    "it was , however , only conjectured but not really demonstrated that it admits dynamo action inside the fluid body in the high  conductivity limit .",
    "the present paper clearly demonstrates the possibility of a fast dynamo inside the fluid body , whose magnetic field is then , as required by the bondi  gold theorem , completely confined in the fluid body and in that sense invisible from outside .",
    "the model is also in another respect , which is not necessarily connected with the high  conductivity limit , of interest for the fundamentals of mean  field dynamo theory . in most of the mean  field dynamo models elaborated in view of cosmic objects only a few contributions to the mean electromotive force have been taken into account , and others were cancelled in the vague hope that they are of minor importance .",
    "we demonstrate here the possibility of dynamo action in an idealised model which is consistent in the sense that it includes all contributions to the electromotive force which occur under this idealisation .",
    "it remains to be discussed whether the concentration of the dynamo  generated magnetic field in the interior of a highly conducting body , which was demonstrated above , may indeed occur in astrophysical bodies ."
