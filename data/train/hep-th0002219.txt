    "[ intro ]    the non - abelian affine toda ( naat ) equations  @xcite are integrable ( multi - component ) generalizations of the sine - gordon equation for a bosonic field that takes values in a non - abelian lie group , in contrast with the usual toda field theories where the field takes values in the ( abelian ) cartan subgroup of a lie group . in  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) , it was found the subset of naat equations that can be written as the classical equations of motion of an action with a positive - definite kinetic term , a real potential term bounded from below and , moreover , with a mass - gap in order to make possible an @xmath5-matrix description .",
    "the resulting theories were named homogeneous sine - gordon ( hsg ) and symmetric space sine - gordon ( sssg ) theories , which are associated with the different compact lie groups and compact symmetric spaces , respectively .",
    "actually , the hsg and sssg theories of  @xcite are particular examples of the deformed coset models constructed by park in  @xcite and the symmetric space sine - gordon models constructed by bakas , park and shin in  @xcite , respectively , where the specific form of the potential makes them exhibit a mass gap .",
    "there are some general features of these theories that have to be emphasized .",
    "the first one is that all of them have soliton solutions .",
    "taking into account that both the hsg and sssg theories are described by actions with sensible properties , this is in contrast with the usual affine toda field theories where the condition of having soliton solutions ( imaginary coupling constant ) always leads to an ill defined action which makes the quantum theory problematic  @xcite .",
    "the second is that they are defined by an action of the form s[h ] = \\ { s_wznw[h ] - d^2x v(h ) } , where @xmath6 is a field that takes values in a non - abelian compact group @xmath7 , @xmath8 is some potential function on the group manifold , and @xmath9 is either the wznw action for the group @xmath7 or the gauged wznw action for a coset of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an abelian subgroup of @xmath7 to be specified .",
    "therefore , if the quantum theory is to be well defined then the coupling constant has to be quantized : @xmath12 , for some positive integer @xmath13 ( see   for a more precise form of this quantization rule ) .",
    "such a quantization does not occur in the sine - gordon theory or the usual affine toda theories because the field takes values in an abelian group in those cases . an important consequence of this is that , in the quantum theory , the @xmath14 will not be a continuous coupling constant .",
    "however , the quantum theory will have other continuous coupling constants that appear in the potential and , in particular , determine the mass spectrum . a third feature which follows from",
    "is that these theories are naturally described as perturbations of conformal field theory ( cft ) coset models .",
    "therefore , they will provide a lagrangian formulation for some already known integrable perturbations of cft s and , furthermore , they will also lead us to discovering new ones .",
    "finally , these theories are expected to exhibit realistic properties of quantum particles not captured by other integrable field theories ; for instance , the presence of unstable particles .    the main quantum properties of the hsg theories are quite well understood .",
    "they are integrable perturbations of the @xmath7-parafermion theories , which are coset cft s of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath7 is a compact simple lie group of rank  @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a maximal torus , and the ` level '  @xmath13 is a positive integer .",
    "the perturbation is given by a spinless primary field of conformal dimension @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the dual coxeter number of  @xmath7 .",
    "the simplest hsg theory is associated to @xmath20 , whose equation of motion is the complex sine - gordon equation  @xcite .",
    "this theory corresponds to the perturbation of the usual @xmath21-parafermions by the first thermal operator  @xcite , whose exact factorizable scattering matrix is the minimal one associated to @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the quantum integrability of the hsg theories for arbitrary  @xmath7 was established in  @xcite , its soliton spectrum was obtained in  @xcite , and a proposal for the exact factorizable @xmath5-matrices of the theories related to simply laced lie groups @xmath7 has been made in  @xcite .",
    "the main feature of those @xmath5-matrices is that they possess resonance poles which can be associated directly to the presence of unstable particles in the spectrum via the classical lagrangian . actually , to the best of our knowledge , these are the only known integrable quantum field theories that describe unstable particles .",
    "the @xmath5-matrices of  @xcite have been probed in  @xcite using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz . in particular , this analysis confirms the expected value of the central charge of the unperturbed cft for any simply laced  @xmath7 , and supports the interpretation of the resonance poles as a trace of the existence of unstable particles in the theory .",
    "these scattering matrices have been recently generalized in a lie algebraic sense by fring and korf in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the quantum properties of the generality of sssg theories are not known , and the purpose of this paper is to partially fill this gap .",
    "namely , we will find the class of perturbed cft s corresponding to the sssg theories , investigate their quantum integrability , and discuss the general features of their spectrum of solitons .",
    "the sssg theories are related to a compact symmetric space @xmath0 , with a @xmath1-valued field , and describe perturbations of either the wznw cft corresponding to @xmath1 or a coset cft of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a torus of @xmath1 , not necessarily maximal .",
    "the equations of motion of this kind of theories for more general choices of the normal subgroup @xmath11 were originally considered in the context of the , so called , reduced two - dimensional @xmath25-models  @xcite , although their lagrangian formulation was not known until much later  @xcite .",
    "the results of  @xcite show that they fit quite naturally into the class of non - abelian affine toda theories and ,",
    "what is more important , that the condition of having a mass gap requires that @xmath11 is either trivial or abelian .",
    "the simplest sssg theories are the ubiquitous sine - gordon field theory , which corresponds to @xmath26 , and the complex sine - gordon theory , which is related this time to @xmath27  @xcite ( recall that it is also the hsg theory associated to @xmath28 ) .",
    "actually , these two theories serve as paradigms of what can be expected in more complex situations . another theories already discussed in the literature that belong to the class of sssg theories are the integrable perturbations of the @xmath29 wznw model and its @xmath30 reduction constructed by brazhnikov  @xcite . both of them are related to the symmetric space @xmath31 and , moreover , the second is identified with the perturbation of the usual @xmath21-parafermions by the second thermal operator .",
    "the classification of the sssg theories as perturbed cft s is achieved through the calculation of the central charge of the unperturbed cft and the conformal dimension of the perturbation .",
    "since the unperturbed cft is always a coset cft of the form @xmath23 , the calculation of its central charge is straightforward .",
    "in contrast , the calculation of the conformal dimension of the perturbation requires the knowledge of the structure of the symmetric space . the symmetric space @xmath0 is associated with a lie algebra decomposition @xmath32 that satisfies the commutation relations g_0 , g_1 , g_0 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the lie algebras of @xmath7 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "then , the conformal properties of the perturbation depend on the structure of the representation of @xmath34 provided by @xmath35\\subset g_{1}$ ] .",
    "first of all , if the perturbation is to be given by a single primary field , then this representation has to be irreducible .",
    "this amounts to restrict the choice of @xmath0 to the , so called , ` irreducible symmetric spaces '  @xcite , which have been completely classified by cartan and are labelled by type  i and type  ii .    in section  [ sssg ] , we summarize the main features of the sssg theories . in section  [ typei ] , the conformal dimension of the perturbation corresponding to all the sssg models related to type  i symmetric spaces is calculated by making use of the relationship between the classification of type  i symmetric spaces and the classification of the finite order automorphisms of complex lie algebras .",
    "it is worth noticing that this analysis only depends on the structure of the representation of @xmath34 given by @xmath35\\subset g_{1}$ ] .",
    "therefore , our results apply to any sssg related to a type  i symmetric space irrespectively of the choice of the normal subgroup @xmath11 that determines the coset @xmath23 and specifies the underlying cft . for example",
    ", they provide the conformal dimension of the perturbation in the sssg models constructed by bakas , park and shin in  @xcite , which include the generalized sine - gordon models related to the naat equations based on @xmath36 embeddings constructed by hollowood , miramontes and park in  @xcite .",
    "the classical integrability of all these theories is a consequence of the relationship between their equations of motion and the naat equations , which ensure the existence of an infinite number of classically conserved quantities .",
    "concerning quantum integrability , it can be established by invoking a well known result due to parke , which affirms that the existence of two higher spin conserved quantities of different spin in a two - dimensional quantum field theory is enough to ensure that there is no particle production in scattering processes and that the @xmath5-matrix is factorizable  @xcite .",
    "this way , the quantum integrability of the hsg theories was demonstrated in  @xcite by checking that the classically conserved quantities of spin @xmath37 remain conserved in the quantum theory after an appropriate renormalization .",
    "the majority of sssg theories also have classically conserved quantities of spin @xmath37 , and we expect that the analysis in  @xcite can be generalized to those cases without much effort . however , there is a class of sssg where the simplest higher spin classically conserved quantities are of spin @xmath38 : the theories related to symmetric spaces of maximal rank , _",
    "i.e. _ , those which satisfy @xmath39 , where the rank of the symmetric space is the dimension of the maximal abelian subspaces contained in @xmath40 . in section  [ integra ] , we explicitly check that at least two of those classically conserved quantities of spin @xmath38 remain conserved in the quantum theory for all the theories related to a symmetric space of maximal rank where  @xmath11 is trivial .",
    "we name these theories ` split models ' , and they are the only sssg theories which correspond to massive quantum integrable perturbations of wznw theories .",
    "it is worth noticing that ( marginal ) perturbations of wznw models have been recently considered in the context of @xmath41 black holes  @xcite .",
    "the results of section  [ integra ] , together with those of  @xcite , support the conjecture that all the sssg are quantum integrable .",
    "this implies that they should admit a factorizable @xmath5-matrix and the next stage of analysis consists in establishing its form . since we expect that it should be possible to infer the form of the exact @xmath5-matrix through the semiclassical quantization of the solitons , in section  [ soliton ] we investigate the general features of the spectrum of solitons . in view of the different kinds of sssg theories",
    ", we have restricted the analysis to the split models , which illustrate the main properties to be expected . like the sine - gordon and complex sine - gordon theories ,",
    "the fundamental particles of the theory can be identified with some of the classical soliton solutions . moreover ,",
    "the solitons of the split models are topological and do not carry noether charges , again like the solitons of the sine - gordon theory .",
    "the origin of the topological charge is both the existence of different vacua and the fact that @xmath1 can be non simply connected .",
    "this is in contrast with the solitons of the hsg theories which are not topological but carry a @xmath42 abelian noether charge  @xcite .",
    "in general , the solitons of a generic sssg theory corresponding to a perturbation of a coset cft of the form @xmath10 are expected to carry both topological charges and abelian noether charges related to a global symmetry of the classical action specified by @xmath11 . in this sense",
    ", they are analogous to the dyons in four - dimensional non - abelian gauge theories  @xcite . another relevant feature of the solitons of the split models , which is expected to be shared with other sssg theories , is that their mass spectrum suggests that some of them might describe unstable particles in the quantum theory , which is analogous to what happens in the hsg theories  @xcite .",
    "actually , the unstability of the heaviest solitons in the spectrum has been checked by brazhnikov in the sssg theories related to @xmath31 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] , and we have collected the explicit expressions for the classically conserved densities of the split models together with some useful algebraic notation in the appendix .",
    "[ sssg ]    the different sssg models of  @xcite are characterized by four algebraic data : @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath33 is a compact semisimple finite lie algebra , and @xmath25 is an involutive ( @xmath44 ) automorphism of @xmath33 that induces the decomposition g = g_0 g_1 , with @xmath34 the set of fixed points of @xmath25 and @xmath45 .",
    "the subspaces @xmath34 and @xmath40 satisfy the commutation relations  , which exhibits that @xmath46 is a compact symmetric space , where @xmath7 and @xmath1 are the lie groups corresponding to the compact lie algebras @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . actually , the different choices for @xmath47 are in one - to - one relation with the different compact symmetric spaces @xmath0 , which prompted the name chosen in  @xcite for this class of models .",
    "finally , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are two semisimple elements in @xmath40 whose choice is only restricted by the condition that ( ad__+ ) g_0 = ker(ad__- ) g_0 = g_0 ^ 0 is abelian , which is required to ensure the existence of a mass gap  @xcite .",
    "they play the role of continuous coupling constants .    the sssg model associated to @xmath43 or ,",
    "equivalently , to @xmath50 and the symmetric space @xmath0 is specified by the action s_sssg=\\",
    "{ s_wznw[h]+ } , where @xmath51 is a bosonic field taking values in @xmath1 , @xmath52 is the gauged wznw action corresponding to the coset @xmath53 , with @xmath11 the abelian lie group corresponding to @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the only mass scale of the theory  @xcite .",
    "the sssg action   is invariant with respect to the abelian gauge transformations he^ h e^- ( ) for any @xmath56 .",
    "since the potential @xmath57 introduced in has @xmath58 left - right symmetry , this gauge symmetry is essential to make the sssg theories exhibit a mass gap .",
    "the precise form of the group of gauge transformations is specified by @xmath59 , which is an automorphism of @xmath54 that will not play any role in the following sections ; we refer the reader to  @xcite for further details about the conditions to be satisfied by @xmath59 .",
    "the gauge symmetry leaves a residual global @xmath60-symmetry , with @xmath61 , which , in particular , makes the classical solitonic solutions carry conserved abelian noether charges , a feature that is shared with the hsg theories .",
    "moreover , as will be discussed in section  [ soliton ] , the solitonic solutions of the sssg theories may also carry topological charges .",
    "this possibility does not exist in the case of the hsg theories where all the possible vacuum configurations get identified modulo gauge transformations .",
    "the action   can be obtained by hamiltonian reduction of a gauged two loop wznw model  @xcite associated to the affine kac - moody algebra @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the complexification of @xmath33 and @xmath64 or  @xmath65 is the least positive integer for which @xmath66 is an inner automorphism ( see the comments below  ) .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian reduction approach has been recently followed by gomes _",
    "_ to construct another class of ( classical ) affine non - abelian toda models different to the sssg theories  @xcite .",
    "the classical integrability of these theories is a consequence of the connection between their equations of motion and the non - abelian affine toda equations  @xcite .",
    "this is made explicit by considering a particular gauge fixing prescription where the classical equations of motion reduce to  @xcite & & _ -(h^_+h)=-m^2 [ _ + , h^_-h ] , + & & p(h^_+h)= p(_-hh^)=0 , where @xmath67 is a projector onto the subalgebra @xmath54 , and @xmath68 are the light - cone variables .",
    "the first equation in   is a non - abelian affine toda equation , and the second provide a set of constraints which come from the variation of the action with respect to the abelian gauge connections in the ls gauge  @xcite .",
    "notice that the equations   are left invariant by the transformation x -x , hh^ , _",
    "^1 _ , for an arbitrary real number @xmath69 , which shows that the sssg theories are parity invariant only if @xmath70 for some real number @xmath69 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are chosen to be parallel or anti - parallel  @xcite .    at the quantum level",
    ", the sssg theories will be described as perturbed cft s of the form s = s_cft + m^2 ^ 2 x ( x , t ) .",
    "if , according to  , @xmath71 with @xmath72 , @xmath73 will be the action of either the cft associated to the coset @xmath2 ( @xmath74 ) or the wznw model corresponding to @xmath1 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "moreover , the perturbation is given by @xmath76 , which will be understood as a matrix element of the wznw field taken in the representation of @xmath1 provided by @xmath77\\subset g_1 $ ] .",
    "as shown originally by bakas for the complex sine - gordon theory  @xcite , and used in  @xcite to define the hsg theories at the quantum level , these identifications constitute a non - perturbative definition of the sssg theories .    for a given symmetric space @xmath0 ,",
    "it is important to emphasise that the form of the coset @xmath78 is fixed by the choice of @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath50 are semisimple elements of @xmath33 , different choices will lead to different values of @xmath79 in the range 0 ( g)-rank(g / g_0 ) p , where the rank of the symmetric space , @xmath80 , is the dimension of the maximal abelian subspaces contained in @xmath40 , and @xmath81 or  1 depending on whether @xmath48 and @xmath49 are linearly independent or not , respectively .",
    "in particular , the lower bound is reached when @xmath82 are regular and , hence , @xmath83 is already a maximal abelian subspace of @xmath33 .",
    "all this implies that the sssg theories provide a rich variety of different integrable models that include , for @xmath84 , new massive perturbations of the theory of @xmath1-parafermions different than those provided by the homogeneous sine - gordon theories  @xcite . notice that this case happens only if the symmetric space satisfies @xmath85 .",
    "another particularly interesting class of models occurs when @xmath86 and @xmath75 . in this case",
    ", the sssg theory is just a massive perturbation of the wznw model corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "we will concentrate on the theories where the perturbation in   is given by a single spinless primary field of the  cft which , taking into account the properties of the wznw field  @xcite , amounts to restrict ourselves to the sssg theories associated with symmetric spaces where the representation of @xmath34 provided by @xmath87\\subset g_1 $ ] is irreducible .",
    "otherwise , the perturbation will be the sum of more than one primary field .",
    "the symmetric spaces with that property are called ` irreducible ' , and have been completely classified by cartan  @xcite .",
    "there are two types of compact irreducible symmetric spaces :    * _ type i , _ where the compact lie algebra @xmath33 is simple . * _ type ii , _ where the compact lie algebra is of the form @xmath88 with @xmath89 simple , and the involution @xmath25 interchanges @xmath40 and @xmath90 .    in the following",
    "we will only consider the sssg theories associated to the type  i symmetric spaces , which admit a thorough classification .",
    "[ typei ]    in this section , we calculate the central charge of the unperturbed cft and the conformal dimension of the perturbation corresponding to the sssg theories associated with the symmetric spaces of type  i. we will make use of the relationship between the cartan classification of this type of symmetric spaces and the kac classification of the automorphisms of finite order of complex lie algebras , which provides a systematic and very convenient description of the involutive automorphism  @xmath25 .",
    "this represents an important advantage with respect to previous works on integrable systems associated with symmetric spaces  @xcite which generally make use of explicit parametrizations of the field  @xmath51 based on some matrix representation for the symmetric space .",
    "[ typei1 ] the basic result is due to kac , who established the following correspondence between the involutions of a complex lie algebra @xmath63 and the involutions of its compact real form @xmath33 .",
