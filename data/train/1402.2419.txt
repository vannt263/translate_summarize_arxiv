    "<S> overall , our results suggest that relaxation processes which have a low probability of being reversed in supercooled liquids and in sheared glasses may well be associated with a change in the spatial distribution of structurally soft regions .    to better understand the implications of the correlations we detect for @xmath54 for the supercooled dynamics , at each @xmath55 we quantify the spatial distribution of dh using the dynamic propensity ( dp ) . </S>",

    "<S> the statistical overlap @xmath62 is also very similar to @xmath61 , indicating that the soft mode localization in nearby iss has a similar degree of spatial correlation with dh . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging picture is that the soft modes of the initial is are able to predict the spatial pattern of dh occurring over timescales where the system visits many different minima , because of the very similar soft mode pattern of minima belonging to the same meta - basin .    to extend these observations to lower temperature </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider the overlap @xmath65 , since the dw - factor is less computationally demanding and spatially correlated with the dp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 initially behaves similar to @xmath61 but , at the lowest temperatures where we can equilibrate the system , stops increasing and approaches a plateau . </S>",
