    "since its discovery the josephson effect  @xcite has been studied for a variety of superconducting weak links  @xcite .",
    "the research has recently entered a new phase with the experimental realization of quantum dot weak links exploiting electronic properties of finite - length carbon nanotubes coupled to superconducting leads  @xcite . in particular , for the first time since its theoretical prediction  @xcite resonant josephson tunneling through discrete electronic states has been observed in carbon nanotube quantum dots  @xcite . as demonstrated in refs .  , the novel type of weak links exhibits transistor - like functionalities , e.g. a periodic modulation of the critical current with a gate voltage tuning successive energy levels in the dot on- and off - resonance with the fermi energy in the leads .",
    "this property has already been implemented in a recently proposed carbon nanotube superconducting quantum interference device ( cnt - squid )  @xcite with possible applications in the field of molecular magnetism .",
    "motivated by the experiments on resonant josephson tunneling , in this paper we investigate theoretically how robust it is with respect to pair - breaking perturbations in the superconducting leads .",
    "cooper pair breaking can be induced by a number of factors , e.g. by paramagnetic impurities  @xcite , an external magnetic field  @xcite or by structural inhomogeneities producing spatial fluctuations of the superconducting coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "it can cause a drastic distortion of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superconducting state , which manifests itself in the smearing of the bsc density of states leading to gapless superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "while the pair - breaking effect on bulk superconductivity is now well understood , its implications for quantum superconducting transport have been studied to a much lesser extent [ see , e.g. refs .  ]",
    "which to our knowledge does not cover josephson tunneling through quantum dots .",
    "on the other hand , in low - dimensional systems pair - breaking effects may be observable in a common experimental situation when , for instance , a carbon nanotube weak link is subject to a magnetic field .",
    "since the orbital field effect in the quasi - one - dimensional channel is strongly suppressed , pair breaking in the superconducting leads can be the main source of the magnetic field dependence of the josephson current .",
    "this situation is addressed in our work .",
    "= 0.5    the influence of pair breaking on the josephson current can not , in general , be accounted for by mere suppression of the order parameter in the superconducting leads . as was pointed out in ref .  , it is a more subtle effect involving the modification of the spectrum of current carrying states in the junction , in particular , the subgap states usually referred to as andreev bound states ( abs )  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this idea for quantum dot junctions in the simple model of a short superconducting constriction with a scattering region containing a single breit - wigner resonance near the fermi energy .",
    "the josephson current is calculated using the normal - state scattering matrix of the system and the andreev reflection matrix  @xcite . unlike refs .",
    "we focus on dirty superconductors for which the andreev matrix can be quite generally expressed in terms of the quasiclassical green functions  @xcite , allowing us to treat pair breaking in the superconducting leads nonperturbatively .",
    "although we account for all energies ( below and above the abrikosov - gorkov gap @xmath2 ) , it turns out that the behavior of the josephson current can be well understood in terms of a pair - breaking - induced modification of the abs , which depends sensitively on the relation between the breit - wigner resonance width @xmath3 and the superconducting pairing energy @xmath4 .",
    "both the critical supercurrent and the josephson current - phase relation are analyzed under experimentally realizable conditions .",
    "we consider a junction between two superconductors @xmath5 and @xmath6 adiabatically narrowing into quasi - one - dimensional ballistic wires @xmath7 and @xmath8 coupled to a normal conductor @xmath9 [ fig .",
    "[ cons ] ] .",
    "the transformation from the superconducting electron spectrum to the normal - metal one is assumed to take place at the boundaries @xmath10 and @xmath11 , implying the pairing potential of the form  @xcite : @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 with the order parameter phase difference @xmath18 and the junction length @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the fermi velocity in @xmath21 ) .",
    "the josephson coupling can be interpreted in terms of the andreev process  @xcite whereby an electron is retro - reflected as a fermi - sea hole from one of the superconductors with the subsequent hole - to - electron conversion in the other one .",
    "such an andreev reflection circle facilitates a cooper pair transfer between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "normal backscattering from disordered superconducting bulk into a single - channel junction is suppressed due to the smallness of the junction width compared to the elastic mean free path @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath9 region in the middle of the junction is thus supposed to be the only source of normal scattering . in such type of weak links the josephson current",

    "first of all , there is no restriction on energy @xmath64 , e.g. for @xmath65 , equations ( [ sa ] ) and ( [ a ] ) are valid both below and above the reduced ( abrikosov - gorkov ) quasiparticle gap @xmath66 .",
