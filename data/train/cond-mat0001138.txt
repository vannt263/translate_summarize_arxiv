    "the phenomenon of multifractality consists in a scale dependence of critical exponents .",
    "it has been widely discussed in the literature for a wide range of issues , such as statistics of strange sets @xcite , diffusion limited aggregation @xcite , wavelet transforms @xcite , conformal invariance @xcite or statistical properties of critical wave functions of massless dirac fermions in a random magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the aim of our work is not only to describe a new model possessing multiscaling dependence , but also to show that the phenomenon of multifractality is related to local nonuniformity of the exponentially growing ( `` hyperbolic '' ) underlying `` target '' phase space , through an example of entangled random walks distribution in homotopy classes . indeed , to our knowledge , almost all examples of multifractal behavior for physical @xcite or more abstract @xcite systems share one common feature ",
    "all target phase spaces have a noncommutative structure and are locally nonuniform .",
    "we believe that multiscaling is a much more generic physical phenomenon compared with uniform scaling , appearing when the phase space of a system possesses a hyperbolic structure with local symmetry breaking .",
    "such perturbation of local symmetry could be either regular or random  from our point of view the details of the origin of local nonuniformity play a less significant role .",
    "we discuss below the basic features of multifractality in a locally nonuniform regular hyperbolic phase space .",
    "we show in particular that a multifractal behavior is encountered in statistical topology in the case of entangled ( or knotted ) random walks distribution in topological classes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect:2 ]",
    "we consider a 2d @xmath0step random walk in a nonsymmetric array of topological obstacles and investigate the multiscaling properties of the `` target '' phase space for a set of specific topological invariants  the `` primitive paths '' .",
    "the renormalization group computations of mean length of the primitive path , as well as return probabilities to the unentangled topological state are developed in section [ sect:3 ] .",
    "section [ sect:4 ] is devoted to the application of conformal methods to a geometrical analysis of multifractality in locally nonuniform hyperbolic spaces .",
    "the concept of multifractality has been formulated and clearly explained in the paper @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling the basic definitions of rnyi spectrum , which will be used in the following .",
    "let @xmath1 be an abstract invariant distribution characterizing the probability of a dynamical system to stay in a basin of attraction of some stable configuration @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "taking a uniform grid parameterized by `` balls '' of size @xmath4 , we define the family of fractal dimensions @xmath5 : [ 1:dq ] d_q=_l0 as @xmath6 is varied , different subsets of @xmath7 associated with different values of @xmath6 become dominant .",
    "let us define the scaling exponent @xmath8 as follows @xmath9 where @xmath8 can take different values corresponding to different regions of the measure which become dominant in eq.([1:dq ] ) .",
    "in particular , it is natural to suggest that @xmath10 can be rewritten as follows : @xmath11 \\right|_{l\\to 0}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the probability to have the value @xmath8 lying in a small `` window '' @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 is a continuous function which has sense of fractal dimension of the subset characterized by the value @xmath8 .    supposing @xmath15 one can approximately evaluate the last expression via the saddle  point method .",
    "thus , one gets ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath16 what together with ( [ 1:dq ] ) leads to the following equations [ 1:dq2 ]    l ( q)=q(q)-f[(q ) ] + ( q)=(q )    where @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] are related via legendre transform . for further details and more advanced mathematical analysis ,",
    "the reader is refered to @xcite .",
    "topological constraints essentially modify physical properties of the broad class of statistical systems composed of chain  like objects .",
    "it should be stressed that topological problems are widely investigated in connection with quantum field and string theories , 2d gravitation , statistics of vortices in superconductors , quantum hall effect , thermodynamic properties of entangled polymers etc .",
    "modern methods of theoretical physics allow us to describe rather comprehensively the effects of nonabelian statistics on the physical behavior of some systems .",
    "however the following question remains still obscure : what are the fractal ( and as it is shown below , multifractal ) properties of the distribution function of topological invariants , characterizing the homotopy states of a statistical system with topological constraints ?",
    "we investigate this problem in the framework of the model `` random walk in an array of obstacles '' ( rwao ) .",
    "the rwao  model can be regarded as physically clear and as a very representative image for systems of fluctuating chain  like objects with a full range of nonabelian topological properties .",
    "this model is formulated as follows : suppose that a random walk of @xmath0 steps of length @xmath20 takes place on a plane between obstacles which form a simple 2d rectangular lattice with unit cell of size @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the random walk can not cross ( `` pass through '' ) any obstacles .",
    "it is convenient to begin with the lattice realization of the rwao  model . in this case",
    "the random path can be represented as a @xmath0step random walk in a square lattice of size @xmath22 ( @xmath23)see fig.[1:fig:1 ] .",
    "it had been shown previously ( see , for example @xcite ) that for @xmath24 a lattice random walk in the presence of a regular array of obstacles ( punctures ) on the dual lattice @xmath25 is topologicaly equivalent to a free random walk on a graph  a cayley tree with branching number @xmath26 ( see fig.[1:fig:2 ] ) .",
    "an outline of the derivation of this result is as follows .",
    "the different topological states of our problem coincide with the elements of the homotopy group of the multi - punctured plane , which is the free group @xmath27 generated by a countable set of elements .",
    "the translational invariance allows to consider a local basis and therefore to study the factored group @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a free group with @xmath30 generators whose cayley graph is precisely a @xmath31branching tree .",
    "the relation between cayley trees and hyperbolic geometry is discussed in details in section [ sect:3 ] . intuitively such a relation could be understood as follows .",
    "the cayley tree can be isometrically embedded in the hyperbolic plane @xmath32 ( surface of constant negative curvature ) .",
    "the group @xmath29 is one of the discrete subgroups of the group of motion of the hyperbolic plane @xmath33 , therefore the cayley tree can be considered as a particular discrete realization of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "returning to the rwao  model ,",
    "we conclude that each trajectory in the lattice of obstacles can be lifted to a path in the `` universal covering space '' i.e to a path on the @xmath31branching cayley tree .",
    "the geodesic on the cayley graph , i.e the shortest trajectory along the graph which connects ends of the path , plays the role of a complete topological invariant for the original trajectory in the lattice of obstacles .",
    "for example , the random walk in the lattice of obstacles is closed and contractible to a point ( i.e. is not entangled with the array of obstacles ) if and only if the geodesic length between the ends of the trajectory on the cayley graph is zero . hence , this geodesic length can be regarded as a topological invariant , which preserves the main nonabelian features of the considered problem .",
    "we would like to stress two facts concerning our model : ( i ) the exact configuration of a geodesic is a complete topological invariant , while its length @xmath34 is only a partial topological invariant ( except the case @xmath35 ) ; ( ii ) geodesics have a clear geometrical interpretation , having sense of a bar ( or `` primitive '' ) path which remains after deleting all even times folded parts of a random trajectory in the lattice of obstacles .",
    "the concept of `` primitive path '' has been repeatedly used in statistical physics of polymers , leading to a successful classification of the topological states of chain  like molecules in various topological problems @xcite .    even if many aspects of statistics of random walks in fixed lattices of obstacles have been well understood ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) , the set of problems dealing with the investigation of fractal properties of the distribution of topological invariants in the rwao",
    " model are practically out of discussion .",
    "thus we devote the next section to the study of fractal and multifractal structures of the measure on the set of primitive paths in the rwao  model for @xmath36 .",
    "the classification of different topological states of a @xmath0step random walk in a rectangular lattice of obstacles in the case @xmath36 turns out to be a more difficult and more rich problem than in the case @xmath37 discussed above .",
    "however , after a proper rescaling , the mapping of a random walk in the rectangular array of obstacles to a random walk on a cayley tree can be explored again .",
    "to proceed we should solve two auxiliary problems .",
    "first of all we consider a random walk inside the elementary rectangular cell of the lattice of obstacles .",
    "let us compute :    \\(i ) the `` waiting time '' , i.e the average number of steps @xmath38 which a @xmath39step random walk spends within the rectangle of size @xmath40 ;    \\(ii ) the ratio of the `` escape probabilities '' @xmath41 and @xmath42 through the corresponding sides @xmath43 and @xmath44 for a random walk staying till time @xmath39 within the elementary cell .",
    "the desired quantities can be easily computed from the distribution function @xmath45 which gives the probability to find the @xmath39step random walk with initial @xmath46 and final @xmath47 points within the rectangle of size @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath48 in the continuous approximation ( @xmath49 ) is the solution of the following boundary problem [ 1:2 ] \\",
    "{    l p(x , y , t ) = ( + ) p(x , y , t ) + p(0,y , t)=p(c_x , y , t)=p(x,0,t)=p(x , c_y , t)=0 + p(x , y,0)=(x_0,y_0 )    . where @xmath20 is the length of the effective step of the random walk and the value @xmath50 has sense of a diffusion constant .",
    "the solution of eqs.([1:2 ] ) reads [ 1:3 ] p(x_0,y_0,x , y , t)= _",
    "m_x=1^_m_y=1^ e^-(+ ) t    the `` waiting time '' @xmath38 can be written now as follows [ 1:3a ] = _",
    "0^c_x dx_0 _ 0^c_y dy_0 _ 0^c_x dx _ 0^c_y dy _ 0^dt p(x_0,y_0,x , y , t ) while the ratio @xmath51 can be computed straightforwardly via the relation : [ 1:3b ] =    in the `` ground state dominance '' approximation we truncate the sum ( [ 1:3 ] ) at @xmath52 and get the following approximate expressions : [ 1:4a ] = ; = in the symmetric case ( @xmath53 ) eq.([1:4a ] ) gives @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as it should be for the square lattice of obstacles .",
    "now the distribution function of the primitive paths for the rwao model can be obtained via lifting this topological problem to the problem of _ directed _ random walks on the 4branching cayley tree , where the random walk on the cayley tree is defined as follows :    \\(a ) the total number of steps @xmath56 on the cayley tree is @xmath57 ( the value @xmath38 has been computed in ( [ 1:4a ] ) ) .",
    "\\(b ) the distance ( or `` level '' @xmath34 ) on the cayley tree is defined as the number of steps of the shortest path between two points on the tree .",
    "each vertex of the cayley tree has 4 branches ; the steps along two of them carry a boltzmann weight @xmath58 , while the steps along the two remaining ones carry a boltzmann weight @xmath59 as it is shown in fig.[fig:4_cayley ] .",
    "the value of @xmath59 is fixed by eq.([1:4a ] ) , which yields [ 1:4c ] = =    the ultrametric structure of the topological phase space , i.e. of the cayley tree @xmath60 , allows us to use the results of paper @xcite for investigating multicritical properties of the measure of all primitive ( directed ) paths of @xmath34 steps along the graph @xmath60 with nonsymmetric weights @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( see fig.[fig:4_cayley ] ) . a rigorous mathematical description of such weighted paths on trees ( called cascades ) can be found in @xcite , where the authors derive multifractal spectra , but for different distributions of weights .",

    "results have been achieved through a renormalization group technique on a nonsymmetric cayley tree . the renormalization procedure has allowed us to overcome one major difficulty : in spite of a locally broken spherical symmetry , we have mapped our problem to a symmetric random walk on a tree of effective branching number @xmath31 depending on the lattice parameters . to validate our procedure ,",
    "we have compared the return probabilities obtained via our rg  approach with the exact result of p.gerl and w.woess @xcite and found a very good numerical agreement .    the problem tackled in section [ sect:4 ] is closely related to the one discussed in section [ sect:2 ] .",
    "we believe that the approach developed in section [ sect:4 ] could be very important and informative as it explicitly shows that multifractality is not attached to particular properties of a statistical system ( like random walks in our case ) but deals directly with metric properties of the topological phase space .",
    "as we have already pointed out , the required conformal transforms are known only for triangular lattices , what restricts our study .",
    "however we explicitly showed that the transform @xmath159 maps the multi - punctured complex plane @xmath31 onto the so - called `` topological phase space '' , which is the complex plane @xmath155 free of topological obstacles ( all obstacles are mapped onto the real axis ) .",
    "we have connected multifractality to the multi  valley structure of the properly normalized jacobian @xmath229 of the nonsymmetric conformal mapping @xmath230 .",
    "the conformal mapping obtained has deep relations with number theory , which we are going to discuss in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the `` random walk in an array of obstacles''model can be considered as a basis of a mean  field  like approach to the problem of entropy calculations in sets of strongly entangled fluctuating polymer chains .",
    "namely , we choose a test chain , specify its topological state and assume that the lattice of obstacles models the effect of entanglements with the surrounding chains ( the `` background '' ) . changing @xmath43 and @xmath44 one can mimic the affine deformation of the background . investigating the free energy of the test chain entangled with",
    "the deformed media is an important step towards understanding high - elasticity of polymeric rubbers @xcite .    neglecting the fluctuations of the background as well as the topological constraints which the test chain produces by itself , leads to information losses about the correlations between the test chain and the background .",
    "yet , even in this simplest case we obtain nontrivial statistical results concerning the test chain topologically interacting with the background .",
    "the first attempts to go beyond the mean  field approximation of rwao  model and to develop a microscopic approach to statistics of mutually entangled chain  like objects have been undertaken recently in @xcite .",
