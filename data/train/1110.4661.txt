    "in this paper we present specific applications of our general deformation theory of periodic frameworks @xcite .",
    "considerations related to _ framework flexibility _ appear already in the early structural investigations based on @xmath0-ray crystallography @xcite . for framework materials , envisaged as corner sharing polyhedra , an intuitive notion of a ` coordinated tilting ' of the polyhedra is used in classifying similar structures @xcite or in studies of thermal and pressure effects .",
    "a most important area of theoretical and experimental studies where geometric models of deforming frameworks have been implicated is that concerned with _ displacive phase transitions _",
    "@xcite .",
    "regarding the use of geometrical facts , it should be observed that , for most framework structures , only a confined sample of geometrical possibilities has been explored in the literature , typically one - parameter families which are intuitively ` accessible ' .",
    "the deformation theory developed in our paper @xcite shows that one may expect , in general , a rich and diverse geometry .",
    "the present undertaking describes the deformation spaces for tetrahedral periodic frameworks modeled on _ quartz , cristobalite and tridymite_.",
    "the ideal structure considered here is made of congruent regular tetrahedra .",
    "the oxygen atoms would correspond with the vertices , each oxygen being shared by two tetrahedra .",
    "the silicon atoms should be imagined at the centers of the tetrahedra .",
    "we shall examine all the geometric deformations of the periodic framework described in figure  [ figq ] , without concern for self - collision or any prohibition of a physical nature .",
    "equivalence under euclidean motions is eliminated by assuming the tetrahedron marked @xmath1 as fixed .",
    "since all edges maintain their length , the positions of the two tetrahedra which share the vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are completely described by two orthogonal transformations @xmath4 , respectively @xmath5 as follows : @xmath4 fixes @xmath2 and takes @xmath6 to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , while @xmath5 fixes @xmath3 and takes @xmath9 to @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the figure , by depicting only the ` visible ' edges , implies that both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are orientation reversing , that is , as orthogonal matrices @xmath12 .",
    "if we denote the edge vectors @xmath13 by @xmath14 , we have :    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    it follows that the dependency condition of a zero sum for these four generators of the periodicity lattice takes the form    @xmath19    under our regularity assumptions , the three vectors @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 have the same length and form an equilateral triangle .",
    "this restricts @xmath21 to the circle on the sphere of radius @xmath23 ( which corresponde with an angle of @xmath24 with @xmath25 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is constrained to a surface , which is differentiably a two - torus @xmath27 .    for each choice of @xmath28 on this torus , @xmath20 is determined by ( [ 0sum ] ) , hence @xmath29 is restricted to a circle @xmath30 in @xmath31 .",
    "it follows that    [ quartz ] the deformation space of the ideal quartz framework is given by a three dimensional torus @xmath32 minus the degenerate cases when the span of the four vectors is less than three dimensional .",
    "the case of the ` ideal @xmath33 cristobalite ' structure illustrated in figure  [ figc ] is already covered in @xcite .",
    "the periodicity group of the framework is give by all the translational symmetries of the ideal crystal framework .",
    "as a result , there are @xmath34 orbits of vertices and @xmath35 orbits of edges .    adopting the notations of figure  [ figcc ]",
    ", we may assume the tetrahedron @xmath36 as fixed and parametrize the possible positions of the other tetrahedon by a rotation around the origin @xmath37 .",
    "[ cristobalite ] the deformation space of the ideal high cristobalite framework is naturally parametrized by the open set in @xmath31 where the depicted generators remain linearly independent .",
    "the tetrahedral framework @xmath38 of tridymite is depicted in figure  [ figt ] .",
    "we consider the ideal case made of regular tetrahedra .",
    "the quotient graph has @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "all deformations can be described by three orthogonal transformations ( matrices ) @xmath41 acting with centers at @xmath42 and respectively @xmath43 . with @xmath37 as the origin and the tetrahedron @xmath44 assumed fixed , we put :                          we may interpret this system as a problem about a _",
    "spherical four - bar mechanism _ in the following way .",
    "all the vectors implicated in ( [ tsystem ] ) are unit vectors and can be depicted as points on the unit sphere @xmath65 . for a given @xmath66 , we mark by @xmath67 the midpoint of the spherical geodesic segment @xmath68 $ ] and trace the circle with center @xmath67 and diameter @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ figs ] .",
    "it is an elementary observation that any solution @xmath69 and @xmath70 determines diameters of the corresponding circles for @xmath71 , with the two geodesic arcs @xmath72 $ ] , like @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] , of length @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the two spherical quadrilaterals with vertices at @xmath76 and respectively @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 are two configurations of the same four - bar mechanism and moreover , the distance between the midpoints of the opposite edges represented by diameters is the same .",
    "it follows from the theory of the spherical four - bar mechanism that , for a generic @xmath66 near the identity of @xmath31 , the abstract configuration space is made of two loops which correspond by reflecting the corresponding realizations .",
    "each loop component has two configurations with the prescibed distance @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "thus , there are four configurations with the prescribed distance .",
    "we observe that if we replace @xmath82 by @xmath83 and @xmath83 by @xmath82 in the labeling of the vertices of a realization , the orientation is reversed , hence the configuration belongs to the other component .",
    "thus , the two obvious solutions of ( [ tsystem ] ) , namely      correspond with configurations on the two different loop components , as do the remaining two , which are also paired by relabeling .",
    "this discussion shows that all four solutions are obtained from the quadrilateral @xmath76 and its reflection in the geodesic @xmath85 $ ] , by the two relabelings with @xmath82 and @xmath83 possible in each case .    in figure  [ figsr ]",
    "we have depicted the quadrilateral @xmath76 as @xmath86 , with reflection in @xmath81 $ ] marked as @xmath87 .",
    "then , , the solutions @xmath88 of the system ( [ tsystem ] ) are the following four solutions : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the deformation space of the tridymite framework is singular in a neighbourhood of the aristotype and can be represented as a ramified covering with four sheets of a three - dimensional domain .",
    "there is a natural @xmath93 action on this covering which fixes the aristotype framework .    indeed , the two involutions , inverting the labeling and reflecting in @xmath85 $ ] , commute ang give a @xmath94 action on the covering .",
    "the dimension of the tangent space at the aristotype framework is computed from the linear version of ( [ tsystem ] ) and is six ."
