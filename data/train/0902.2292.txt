    "as is clear from the varied contributions to this workshop concerned with ongoing work on hera data , much is still being learned from the world s first electron proton ( @xmath0 ) collider @xcite .",
    "measurements based on the final hera data remain of high importance for the physics of strong interactions and proton structure in general and in particular for applications at the lhc @xcite . by now , our understanding of many small @xmath2 and low @xmath3 phenomena in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is limited by experimental systematics and theoretical uncertainties , rather than by statistical precision .",
    "however , particularly for searches for new particles and for the understanding of electroweak effects , the principle limitation is often the available integrated luminosity .    without doubt",
    ", energy - frontier physics will be dominated for the foreseeable future by the proton and heavy ion beams of the lhc , whose unprecedented energy and intensity herald a new era in the field",
    ". it is reasonable to ask whether these proton beams could be exploited as part of a new high performance @xmath0 and electron - ion ( @xmath4 ) ` large hadron electron collider ' ( lhec ) @xcite , complementing the lhc @xmath5 and @xmath6 programme and a possible pure lepton collider at the tev energy scale .",

    "this would yield a centre of mass energy of @xmath8 and would probe distance scales of the order of @xmath9 . for comparison ,",
    "the best performance achieved at hera was a luminosity of @xmath10 at an @xmath0 centre of mass energy of @xmath11 .",
    "the large luminosity increase in particular sets the lhec aside from previously evaluated possible future high energy @xmath0 colliders @xcite ( figure  [ energy : lumi ] ) .",
    "if realised , an @xmath0 machine with this performance would lead to the first precise study of @xmath12-scale lepton - quark interactions . on september 1 - 3 2008 , a diverse mixture of approximately 90 accelerator scientists , experimentalists and theorists met at esplanade du lac , divonne , near cern , for the inaugural meeting @xcite of the ecfa - cern commissioned lhec workshop .",
    "the aim is to assess the physics potential of an electron beam interacting with lhc protons and ions as well as its accelerator , interaction region and detector requirements and the impact on the existing lhc programme .",
    "this contribution is intended both as a summary of the divonne meeting and as a snapshot of the current status of the lhec project , with the focus mainly on the physics motivation .",
    "the accessible kinematic plane assuming a @xmath13 proton and a @xmath14 electron beam is compared with previous experiments in figure  [ kinplane]a .",
    "the coverage is extended compared with hera towards low bjorken @xmath3 at fixed @xmath2 or towards high @xmath2 at fixed @xmath3 by the ratio of squared centre of mass energies @xmath15 . with sufficient luminosity to overcome the basic @xmath16 cross section dependence , squared 4-momentum transfers @xmath17 are accessible . as well as sensitivity to new physics ( section  [ exotics ] )",
    ", the high luminosity will clarify many issues with parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) particularly at the highest @xmath3 ( section  [ partons ] ) .",
    "the ultra - high parton density region @xmath18 will be accessed for the first time at sufficiently large @xmath2 for perturbative qcd techniques to be applied ( sections  [ lowx ] ,  [ diffraction ] and  [ ions ] ) .",
    "when the lhc runs with heavy ions , the lhec becomes the first ever @xmath4 colliding beam machine , extending the known kinematic plane for nuclear structure functions by four orders of magnitude ( section  [ ions ] ) .",

    "must therefore be evaluated against the implications of the corresponding loss of small angle detector acceptance . in the physics studies presented in section  [ physics ] ,",
    "two basic scenarios are considered , corresponding to rough estimates at performance ( see section  [ experiments ] for more details ) . in the first , beam",
    "focusing magnets fill the region @xmath27 , allowing an integrated luminosity of nominally @xmath28 per year to be achieved . in the second",
    ", it is assumed that there are no focusing magnets , allowing acceptance to @xmath29 , but reducing the annual luminosity by an order of magnitude to @xmath30 . in both cases ,",

    "as discussed for many years @xcite , it is natural to think - at some fundamental level - of quarks and leptons as different low energy manifestations of a single underlying form of matter , explaining the quark - lepton symmetry of the standard model , but contrasting with the clear distinctions between them at currently accessible scales .",
    "when searching for new physics , the electron - quark vertex therefore deserves precision study in parallel with pure - lepton and pure - strongly - interacting vertices .",
    "whilst the lhec does not have anything like the discovery potential of the lhc , it gives interesting sensitivity to new leptons or particles with both lepton and baryon quantum numbers .",

    "the leptoquark mass range covered by a search in @xmath35 of lhec data is comparable to that accessed with @xmath36 at the lhc .",
    "however , since leptoquarks are almost always pair - produced at the lhc , unravelling their potentially complex spectroscopy @xcite would be difficult .",
    "the more easily controlled single production vertex in @xmath0 physics allows fermion number to be determined for example from electron beam charge asymmetries , spins from angular decay distributions and chirality from beam polarisation asymmetries @xcite .",
    "another exotic scenario to which the initial state lepton at the lhec gives high sensitivity is the production of excited leptons , as illustrated in figure  [ exotic : fig]c .",
    "the expected limits from studying @xmath37 final states in one year of lhec data are shown in figure  [ exotic : fig]d @xcite . for a wide range of excited electron masses",
    ", the lhec sensitivity extends to significantly lower @xmath38 couplings than are accessed at the lhc .",
    "similarly high sensitivity to excited neutrinos is available from @xmath39 final states .",
    "suspersymmetric electrons are another area of high sensitivity .",
    "the process @xmath40 via neutralino exchange is within observable lhec range for sums of the selectron and squark masses up to around @xmath41 .",
    "if relatively light squarks are observed at the lhc and the selectron is heavy , the lhec sensitivity would be competitive with that of the lhc @xcite .    beyond searches for new particles ,",
    "the lhec would complement the lhc in the investigation of the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "top quarks would be produced copiously , both singly and in pairs , in the relatively clean environment offered by @xmath0 scattering @xcite .",

    "the visible cross section for @xmath44 is around twice that for @xmath45 ( figure  [ higgs]b ) .",
    "with lhec data , the proton pdfs could be measured at previously unexplored @xmath2 values beyond @xmath46 and at small @xmath3 values , approaching @xmath47 in the dis region .",
    "the @xmath3 range covers that required for a full understanding of the initial state of parton - parton scattering on the rapidity plateau at the lhc .",

    "integrated luminosities of @xmath30 at low @xmath2 and @xmath28 at high @xmath2 are assumed ( see section  [ geometry ] ) , leading to uncertainties at the @xmath48 level over much of the kinematic plane after a single year of data taking .",
    "the resulting cross sections have been used as input to an nlo dglap @xcite qcd fit , similar to those used by the hera collaborations , in order to estimate the obtainable lhec precision on the parton distributions .",
    "lhec data could separately constrain all of the quark flavours for the first time in a single experiment .",
    "the large luminosities would give a much improved @xmath49 measurement compared with hera , and the valence densities could hence be extracted precisely . with",
    "copious charged current data for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 collisions , up and down quark distributions could be separated . with state - of - the - art secondary vertex detection and a small beam - spot (",
    "@xmath52 has been assumed ) , heavy flavour quarks could be identified , leading to measurements of the charm and beauty structure functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 to a few percent over a wide kinematic range @xcite . with high luminosity the @xmath55 and @xmath56 densities could be measured to unrivalled precision by tagging charm quarks in charged current scattering ( @xmath57 ) , potentially casting new light on a possible @xmath58 asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity to @xmath59 due to the larger lever - arm in @xmath2 throughout the @xmath3 range translates directly into a new level of precision on the gluon density . in the process of fitting qcd evolution equations",

    "the best reconstruction of @xmath3 and @xmath2 over the full kinematic plane requires the use of the hadronic final state 4-vector as well as that of the scattered electron . at the newly accessed lowest @xmath3 values at the lhec",
    ", the interacting quark is scattered towards the central region of the laboratory frame and can be well reconstructed . however , as @xmath3 grows at fixed @xmath2 , the hadronic final state becomes increasingly strongly boosted in the outgoing proton direction and its measurement becomes increasingly difficult . at the largest @xmath3 values , the resolution obtained from the scattered electron 4-vector alone degrades severely , degrades as @xmath62 as @xmath63 for fixed @xmath2 . ]",
    "such that some control over the very forward - going hadrons is highly desirable .",
    "the need for good hadron reconstruction over a wide @xmath3 range is clearer still for the case of charged current scattering , where only the hadron method is available .      in the low @xmath3 region ,",
    "the usually ` asymptotically free ' quarks of dis meet a high background density of partons , and various novel effects are predicted .",
    "parton density predictions over much of the kinematic range relevant to the lhc rely on the assumption that the dglap approximation to qcd evolution may be used to evolve partons from the relatively low @xmath2 domain of hera and fixed target dis experiments to the larger scales of the lhc .",
    "dglap must , however , become invalid at some low value of @xmath3 , where @xmath64 terms in the evolution become important @xcite and where resummation approaches may be required @xcite . although no evidence of deviations from dglap evolution has been obtained from fits to inclusive hera data ,",
    "there have been hints from hadronic final state observables such as forward jets @xcite and azimuthal jet decorrelations @xcite , which are sensitive to the transverse momentum ordering patterns in the parton cascade .",
    "it is possible that more will be learned from fitting inclusive lhec data , though direct observation of the final state parton cascade will remain necessary for a complete picture , requiring hadronic final state acceptance at very small angles to the beampipe @xcite .    at sufficiently low @xmath3 ,",
    "unitarity constraints become important and a ` black body ' limit is approached @xcite , in which the cross section reaches the geometrical bound given by the transverse proton size .",
    "this limit is characterised by @xmath2 dependences which differ fundamentally from the usual logarithmic scaling violations , diffractive cross sections approaching @xmath65 of the total and other new effects @xcite .",
    "applying the black body bound to the inelastic cross section for the interaction of a colour dipole , formed from a @xmath66 splitting , leads to an approximate constraint on the gluon density @xmath67 @xcite , only a small factor beyond predictions for the gluon at the lowest lhec @xmath3 values .    whilst we have some understanding of the physics of the black body limit itself , the mechanisms and precise dynamics by which it is approached are completely unknown . `",
    "saturation ' effects , in which the low @xmath3 growth of the parton densities is tamed must be present at some value of @xmath3 , a possible mechanism being the onset of recombination processes such as @xmath68 @xcite , leading to non - linear evolution .",
    "although no significant saturation signals have been observed in parton density fits to hera data , hints have been obtained by fitting the data to dipole models @xcite , which may be applied at very low @xmath2 values , beyond the range in which quarks and gluons can be considered to be good degrees of freedom .",
    "the typical conclusion @xcite is that hera data in the perturbative regime do not exhibit any evidence for saturation .",
    "however , when data in the @xmath69 region are included , only models which include saturation effects are successful . whether or not this low @xmath2 hera saturation effect is confirmed ,",
    "it is desirable to fully understand the mechanisms behind saturation in terms of parton dynamics , which may be possible by studying the very low @xmath3 region at somewhat larger @xmath2 at the lhec .",
    "( 50,70 ) ( -16,-10 )    figure  [ f2lowx ] shows extrapolations of dipole models constrained by fits to hera data to predict the structure function @xmath70 in the lhec kinematic range .",
    "the various predictions are shown as pseudo - data points corresponding to the simulated neutral current lhec measurement ( section  [ partons ] ) . at the lowest @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    ", there is a clear distinction between the ` fs04-regge ' model @xcite , which does not include saturation effects , and all others @xcite , which include saturation as estimated from low @xmath2 hera data .",
    "however , any such sensitivity is lost by around @xmath71 , emphasising the importance of low angle scattered electron acceptance .    whilst such extrapolations give encouraging indications , the unequivocal establishment of parton saturation is more complex .",
    "two studies using very different approaches to pdf fitting are in progress @xcite .",
    "they both subject lhec pseudo - data based on dipole models to nlo dglap fits , to determine whether saturation effects could be masked , for example by a sufficiently flexible parton parameterisation .",
    "it is not yet clear whether a breakdown of pure dglap dynamics may be visible with @xmath72 data alone .",
    "if not , the addition of @xmath73 data as a second observable in the fits is likely to prove conclusive .",
    "non - inclusive observables promise to enhance the lhec sensitivity to non - linear evolution and saturation phenomena .",
    "diffractive channels are promising , since the underlying exchange of a pair of gluons may enhance the sensitivity compared with the single gluon involved in inclusive processes .",
    "the cleanest processes experimentally are deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs , @xmath74 ) and vector meson production ( @xmath75 ) , which have played a major role at hera @xcite , but where no detailed lhec work has been done to date @xcite .",

    "similarly to inclusive dis , fractional struck quark momenta relative to the diffractive exchange , @xmath78 , a factor of around 20 lower than at hera are accessible at the lhec .",
    "large improvements in diffractive parton densities ( dpdfs ) @xcite are possible from nlo dglap fits to diffractive structure function data .",
    "the extended phase space towards large @xmath2 at fixed @xmath3 increases the lever - arm for extracting the diffractive gluon density and opens the possibility of significant weak gauge boson exchange , which would allow a quark flavour decomposition for the first time .",
    "figure  [ f2dfigs]c shows a comparison between hera and the lhec in the invariant masses @xmath79 produced in diffractive processes with @xmath80 ( rapgap monte carlo model @xcite ) .",
    "diffractive masses up to several hundred @xmath81 are accessible , such that diffractive final states involving beauty quarks and @xmath82 and @xmath83 bosons , or even exotic states with @xmath84 quantum numbers , would be produced .",
    "in addition , diffractive jet and heavy flavour final states could be studied at much larger transverse momenta than previously , reducing the dominant theory scale uncertainties and thus providing precision tests of factorisation properties and measurements of the problematic gluon density at large @xmath85 .",
    "leading twist diffraction has been related @xcite to the leading twist component of the nuclear shadowing phenomenon , in which the exchanged virtual photon in an @xmath4 interaction scatters coherently from more than one nucleon .",
    "measuring diffractive dis together with nuclear structure functions ( section  [ ions ] ) in the lhec range therefore tests the unified picture of complex strong interactions and leads to a detailed understanding of the shadowing mechanism , possibly essential in interpreting saturation signatures in @xmath4 interactions .    the strong forward boost of the hadronic final state for most processes at the lhec will limit the use of the standard ` large rapidity gap ' technique for selecting diffractive events to lower @xmath86 values than in the hera case . of the @xmath87 system , @xmath88 corresponds to @xmath89 at hera and @xmath90 at the lhec . ] studying inclusive diffraction at the lhec may therefore best be done by directly detecting scattered protons . given that the beam optics for outgoing protons at the lhec would not be very different from those at the lhc",
    ", first considerations @xcite suggest that that the region around @xmath91 from the interaction point would be a suitable place to install a beamline proton spectrometer , similar to that under consideration by atlas and cms @xcite .",
    "first studies have also been made of leading neutron cross sections at the lhec @xcite , where designs similar to the ` leading neutron ' or ` zero degree ' calorimeters at hera and lhc experiments may be appropriate .      whilst establishing parton saturation in @xmath0 collisions at the lhec may require multiple observables",
    ", more striking signals may be available in @xmath4 interactions .",
    "the small @xmath3 nuclear gluon density @xmath92 at central impact parameters is enhanced relative to that ( @xmath93 ) in a nucleon by a factor @xmath94 @xcite , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 represent the nucleon and nuclear radii , respectively , and nuclear shadowing is neglected .",
    "this corresponds to a factor of around 6 for the lead ions which will be used at the lhc , leading to gluon densities close to estimates of the black body limit ( section  [ lowx ] ) . if a really clear signature for parton saturation exists , for example a dramatic flattening of the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath72 structure function at low @xmath3 or anomalously strong scaling violations , it is likely to be established first in @xmath4 collisions , or through comparisons of @xmath4 with @xmath0 data .    experimentally , scattering leptons from the lhc heavy ion beams at large @xmath2 is expected to lead to final states which do not look dramatically different from @xmath0 scattering .",
    "however , unlike for the @xmath0 case , colliding beam configurations have never previously been employed for @xmath4 collisions .",
    "our current knowledge of nuclear parton distributions is thus restricted to the phase space covered by fixed target experiments as shown in figure  [ ea : kinematics ] .",
    "for example , the nmc data in the dis region barely extend below @xmath97 and are restricted to relatively light nuclei ( helium , carbon and calcium ) @xcite .",
    "the lhec would extend the known range by up to four orders of magnitude , offering for the first time a quantitative understanding of the ( presumably saturated ) initial state partons entering the heavy ion collisions which are expected to produce quark gluon plasma conditions at the lhc .",
    "figure  [ ea : kinematics ] also shows the extrapolation of the critical saturation line at central impact parameter , estimated from dipole model fits to low @xmath2 hera data ( section  [ lowx ] ) . with sufficient acceptance at low polar angles ,",
    "the lhec data falls well beyond this line , whilst remaining in the perturbative region .",
    "( 50,57 ) ( -12,-10 )    in addition to the programme with lead or other heavy ions , neutron structure could be explored at the lhec through electron - deuteron scattering @xcite , as has been done in many fixed target dis experiments .",

    "the most promising locations for the interaction point are on the sites of the current alice and lhcb experiments , after they have completed their programmes .",
