    "blue straggler ( bs ) stars were first identified as an unusual subclass of stars in the cluster m3 @xcite . since that time",
    ", stragglers have been identified in most , if not all , globular clusters that have accurate broad - band photometry .",
    "blue straggler candidates have also been identified in a large number of open clusters , e.g. @xcite .",
    "blue stragglers are commonly defined as those stars that are brighter and bluer ( hotter ) than the main sequence ( ms ) turnoff of the majority of the cluster stars , but along an apparent extension of the main sequence . at present , the leading explanation involves mass transfer in and/or merger of a binary star system , or the collision of stars ( whether or not a binary is involved ) .",
    "these mechanisms can create a main sequence star with a mass greater than would be expected given the age of the cluster .",
    "the above definition of blue straggler is overly restrictive if this is the correct explanation .",
    "undoubtedly the same processes act on lower mass stars , although the remnant stars would not be easily identifiable if they were not brighter than the turnoff luminosity .",
    "the color restriction is also unrealistic since real scatter in the colors of blue stragglers in globular clusters has been observed , e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that this color scatter results from a lack of large - scale mixing during the creation process , which means that the amount of helium in the core can vary from straggler to straggler .",
    "hydrodynamical studies @xcite earlier predicted that large - scale mixing does not occur during stellar collisions .",
    "a collisionally - produced straggler is not expected to burn significant lithium initially even if high enough temperatures are reached because the timescale for the straggler to thermally adjust to a new equilibrium configuration is much shorter than the lithium destruction timescale @xcite .",
    "binary mass transfer is likely to lead to a more easily observable abundance pattern since the last of the transferred gas should have come from deep within the parent star ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we have attempted to examine this question by taking spectra of blue straggler stars in the open cluster m67 ( ngc 2682 ) .",
    "m67 makes an ideal target because it is relatively close ( @xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also fairly old ( @xmath4  gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in addition",
    ", the density of stars in open clusters is lower than in nearly all globular clusters , making binary evolution and collisions involving binaries the most likely formation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "globular cluster blue stragglers are not yet practically observable because of their distances .",
    "although much attention has been spent on m67 blue stragglers , few observations are available for the coolest ones .",
    "few blue stragglers have abundance analyses .",
    "@xcite observed a sample of 11 blue stragglers in m67 , although only 2 were examined in detail .",
    "@xcite observed 4 blue stragglers in praesepe ( ngc 2632 ) from the catalog of @xcite , although only one ( hd 73666 ) is undeniably a straggler according to its photometry . in observing the blue stragglers of m67 we are most interested in species such as li , c , n , and o that are processed by nuclear reactions at different temperatures ( and therefore , depths ) in a star .",
    "the reddest blue stragglers in the cluster have effective temperatures that can allow us to get abundances for all of these elements , and are close enough to the temperatures of turnoff stars that we can straightforwardly make comparisons with stars having ( presumably ) unmixed envelopes .",
    "in  2 we describe the spectroscopic observations , and in  3 we present the abundance analysis for our sample . in  4 we discuss the constraints we can place on blue straggler formation mechanisms in this cluster .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] displays the program stars , basic photometry , and the signal - to - noise obtained .",
    "the identification numbers we use are from the proper motion study of @xcite .",
    "we chose our blue straggler candidates from @xcite and our ms members from the proper motion study of @xcite .",
    "all of the chosen m 67 stars are 99% probability proper motion members .",
    "the photometry for our program stars was taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the @xmath7 magnitudes of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite were adjusted by 0.017 , @xmath8 , 0.012 , respectively .",
    "several measurements made by @xcite were found to be in disagreement with the other sources , including ancillary measurements by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the @xcite measurements for s 1183 , s 821 , s 975 , and s 984 were not used to derive the average photometry .",
    "the final adopted values are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] , and the cmd of the cluster and the observed blue stragglers are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we observed one blue straggler candidate @xcite in ngc 7789 .",
    "due to poor weather additional ngc 7789 candidates were not observed .",
    "the majority of the observations were taken with the mcdonald observatory 2.7  m `` 2d - coude '' @xcite .",

    "radial velocities were obtained from individual spectra , but the s / n quoted in table  [ tbl-1 ] are those of the combined spectra .",
    "the combined spectra were also used for the abundance analysis .",
    "additional observations were obtained with the hobby - eberly telescope ( * ? ? ? * het ) during commissioning of the ufoe @xcite spectrograph in early 1999 and in the first science period of 2000 with the ufoe on the het .",

    "because the slit length did not allow proper sky subtraction , which would not interfere with the radial velocity study since m67 is well separated from the solar rest velocity .",
    "the 2.1  m spectra cover from 5400   to 6600  .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] lists the heliocentric julian dates of our observations .",
    "in addition to the program stars one additional m67 star ( mmj5554 ) was observed .",
    "this star is only @xmath11 away from s 975 and its color makes it either a turnoff star or a possible blue straggler candidate .",
    "a set of bright , rapidly - rotating hot stars were observed at various air masses with both telescopes for sky line identification .",
    "figure 2 exhibits a sample of the spectra obtained on the mcdonald 2.1 m .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using the iraf _ echelle _ package .",
    "initial data reduction techniques included bias removal , flat field correction , scattered light removal , sky subtraction and wavelength calibration . to remove instrumental wavelength zero - point errors the spectra were shifted in velocity so that the telluric features fell at their rest velocities .",
    "the largest zero - point correction was 1.1 km s@xmath1 .",
    "each program star spectrum was divided by the hot star spectrum with the most similar telluric line depths .",
    "the spectra were then cross - correlated against a synthetic spectrum to obtain the radial velocities , which were then corrected to the heliocentric rest frame .",
    "a single synthetic spectrum was used for all the stars ( @xmath12 6400 k , log g = 4.3 , @xmath13 = 2.0 , [ fe / h ] = 0.05 , and no instrumental or rotational broadening ) .",
    "the code used to create the synthetic spectrum is the latest version of moog @xcite . to determine the radial velocities of the broad component of s 1082 we took an additional step to remove the narrow component .",
    "we fit the spectrum with a very high order spline ( high enough to remove any broad component ) and then divided this normalized spectrum into the original spectrum leaving only the blaze function and any broad line components .",
    "these cleaned broad - line spectra were then subjected to the analysis described above .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] lists the heliocentric radial velocities and errors for each spectrum .",
    "the mean radial velocity of m67 is 33.6 @xmath14 0.72 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we detect 3 binary periods not previously known for stars in our sample .",
    "s 821 and s 984 are found to have radial velocity variations with periods of 26.259 @xmath14 0.002d and 1.465 @xmath14 0.001 , respectively .",

    "s 821 probably has an eccentricity of @xmath15 , while the data from s 984 is consistent with a circular orbit .",
    "s 1082 is found to be a double lined spectroscopic binary and will be discussed in  3 .",
    "the 2.7  m `` 2d - coude '' spectra were combined after shifting to the heliocentric rest velocity .",
    "new synthetic spectra were created with @xmath12 6400 k , log g = 4.3 , @xmath13 = 2.0 , [ fe / h ] = 0.05 , a gaussian @xmath9 profile , and various rotational velocities .",
    "the unbroadened spectrum was cross - correlated against the broadened spectra and the full width half maxima ( fwhm ) of the correlation peaks were measured .",
    "these fwhm were then compared to the fwhm of the correlation peaks created by the cross - correlation of the combined program star spectra and the unbroadened synthetic spectrum . from this comparison",
    "we determine the rotational velocity of the combined spectrum .",
    "we adopt a conservative lower limit ( 9 km s@xmath1 ) to our ability to measure rotational velocities .",

    "we detect rotation in our spectra for only 3 of the blue straggler stars in our sample : s 975 , s 997 , and s 1082 .",
    "all have relatively low rotation speeds .",
    "in addition , we marginally detect rotation in one of the main sequence stars ( s 1271 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios for the main sequence stars was comparable to those for the blue stragglers .",

    "splot_. these lines , oscillator strengths , and equivalent widths are listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we employed the latest version of the lte spectral analysis code moog @xcite and the @xcite grid of atlas models in an iterative abundance analysis .",
    "the initial estimate of the effective temperature for each star was determined from the dereddened @xmath5 color ( we assumed e@xmath16 ) .",
    "effective temperatures were then determined from the relationship @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "each effective temperature was then fine tuned by forcing the slope of abundances from fe i lines versus excitation potential to be zero .",
    "this tuning of the temperature was restricted to the range of colors consistent with the errors in the photometry .",
    "the two largest corrections were found for s 1082 ( 152 k ; likely binary blending of colors , see  3 ) and s 815 ( 42 k ) .",
    "the surface gravity was set by enforcing abundance equilibrium between the fe i and fe ii lines .",
    "based upon the errors in the fe i and fe ii abundances we estimate the average uncertainty in the surface gravity to be 0.15 dex ( 1 sigma ) .",
    "the microturbulent velocity was determined by forcing the slope of fe i line abundances versus equivalent width to be zero . these adjustments to the spectral model for each star were done iteratively until all the parameters ( @xmath18 , log g , @xmath13 ) fulfilled the above requirements within the abundance uncertainty of each spectrum .",
    "the derived atmospheric parameters and abundances for each star are listed in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "synthetic spectra were also employed to verify the abundances of the c i lines . using the derived atmospheric parameters for each star",
    "a synthetic spectrum was generated and plotted over the observed spectrum and visually inspected .",
    "this method did not yield any significant abundance differences .",
    "the three o i lines found at 7773  are known to need nlte corrections .",
    "these corrections can become very significant at high temperatures ( t @xmath19 6800 k ) . over the narrow range of temperatures we considered the nlte corrections",
    "should be relatively small .",
    "however , we have made some attempt to correct for nlte effects using the lookup table employed by @xcite .",
    "even if the magnitude of our corrections are incorrect , the relative oxygen abundances of the stars can be viewed with some confidence . in figure 4",
    "we display the combined equivalent widths of the o i lines plotted against their colors .",
    "the stars from @xcite are shown as squares .",
    "the large crosses are taken from the @xcite study of oxygen in the hyades .",
    "@xcite found a constant abundance along the main sequence .",
    "note the rapid rise in o i ew near @xmath20 or @xmath12 6840 k , caused by the onset of nlte effects .",
    "the open and filled circles represent abundance analyses with constant oxygen abundance ( [ o / fe ] = 0.0 ) for several temperatures with the nlte corrections of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "a summary of our oxygen abundances is given in table 4 .",
    "because the stragglers in m67 have been observed extensively , we have a better idea of their present status than the stragglers in any other cluster .",
    "it is therefore worth briefly summarizing what is known about the stars in our sample so that we can test whether the compositions reflect differences in straggler formation mechanisms .",
    "* s 975 ( f 90 ) : * this star is known to be a binary ( @xmath21   d ) with small eccentricity ( @xmath22 ) from the work of @xcite .",
    "@xcite indicates that the system is likely to have resulted from case c ( asymptotic giant branch ) mass transfer .",
    "@xcite assert that there is strong evidence of a hot companion in their ultraviolet photometry , and conclude that the system is likely to be the result of algol - type binary mass transfer , although they adopt a photometric temperature @xcite that is more than 300 k cooler than our derived value .",
    "@xcite states that the photometry could be contaminated by a nearby star , so that his temperature estimate is questionable .",
    "the contaminating star must be cooler than s 975 in order to produce the photometric temperature .",
    "mmj 5554 ( @xmath23 ) is probably the cause since it is only @xmath24 away from s 975 , and its colors place it very near the bluest extension of the turnoff . because our spectral temperature did not need to be significantly corrected from our @xmath25 photometric temperature , it is unlikely that this star contaminated our spectrum",
    "judging from figure 2 of @xcite , it probably did not contribute significantly to the uit uv flux .    according to @xcite , `` uncertainty of 200 k in the value of @xmath18 corresponds to about a 0.5 mag uncertainty in the predicted uit magnitude '' , and `` the uit magnitude of f90 is probably uncertain by close to a factor of 2 '' because it was contaminated by the light of the bright blue straggler s 977 .",
    "based on this and our higher @xmath18 , the evidence for a _ hot _ companion to s 975 is considerably weaker , although there is still an unaccounted - for uv excess .",
    "the agreement between our photometric and spectroscopic temperatures indicates that the companion does not contribute significantly to the visual flux ( consistent with being a white dwarf ) .",
    "however , we have been unable to detect the companion s spectral signature , so we are unable to judge whether the spectrum is contaminated .",
    "the star does have an unusually large o i ew though ( see  [ cno ] ) , which may betray the presence of circumstellar material .",
    "* s 984 ( f 134 ) : * because s 984 lies within 0.75 mag of the fiducial line of the cluster in the color - magnitude diagram , it is possible that it is a non - interacting binary composed of two main sequence stars .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the radial velocity data of @xcite was marginally higher than average .",
    "after combining the velocity data from @xcite with our derived velocities , we conducted a periodicity analysis and found a likely period of 1.465 @xmath14 0.001 days .",
    "the peak - to - peak variation is between about 3 and 5 km s@xmath1 , depending on whether we accept one outlying observation from mathieu et al .",
    "the period , radial velocity variation , and photometry do constrain the identity of s 984 though . if we hypothesize that s",
    "984 is a binary composed of stars that have not interacted , it is possible to match the photometry with two main sequence stars having @xmath26 and 13.4 .",
    "this is the maximum brightness contrast that is possible if the primary is to be on the fiducial line of the cluster .",
    "however , this constrains the mass ratio to be @xmath27 .",
    "the orbital inclination is then constrained to be within 1.5 degrees of face - on .",
    "the lithium abundance , which is consistent with that of a single turnoff star , is low for a tidally - locked binary ( as is implied if the radial velocity variations reflect orbital motions ) .",
    "so , there is a fairly strong ( although circumstantial ) case that s 984 is a true blue straggler , and not a photometric blend of two stars .",
    "there may still be a companion , but it is unlikely to contribute to the flux .",
    "if this is the case , s 984 is probably the result of a collisional merger , since binary mass transfer should result in a lack of surface lithium . for these reasons ,",
    "we regard it as likely that the spectrum of s 984 is at most minimally contaminated by another star .    * s 997 ( f 124 ) : * this star is known to be in an eccentric ( @xmath28 ) binary of period 4913 d @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity of the system probably rules out a history as a mass transfer binary .",
    "the fact that the primary is a blue straggler casts doubt on a binary merger since it would either have required the system to have been in a rare triple system , or to have tidally captured a star after merger @xcite .",
    "either way , we do not have evidence to judge whether its spectrum is contaminated .",
    "* s 1082 ( f 131 ; es cancrii ) : * @xcite and @xcite reported that the spectrum of s 1082 has a possible composite nature .",
    "x - ray emission has been detected from this star by @xcite .",
    "@xcite find evidence of a hot subluminous companion in their ultraviolet photometry .",
    "however , @xcite base their predicted uit magnitudes on a temperature 120 k cooler than found in our analysis . since",
    "a 200 k change in temperature corresponds to 0.5 m@xmath29 magnitudes , their evidence for a _ hot _ subluminous companion is weakened , although not eliminated .",
    "the discovery of a variable secondary h@xmath30 spectral feature by @xcite and @xcite suggests the presence of a hot rapidly rotating secondary or an outflowing wind .",
    "further , the spectroscopy of @xcite appears to rule out magnetic activity as the source of the x - ray emission .",
    "this evidence supports the hypothesis that this is an algol - type binary _ currently _ undergoing mass transfer .",
    "in addition to being able to detect the second spectral component in h@xmath30 , the na d lines , and the o i triplet as @xcite did , we also detected the secondary in h@xmath31 , h@xmath32 , paschen(8862 ) , the ca ii ir triplet , lines of moderately strong neutral element species ( e.g. fe i , ca i ) and a few strong fe ii lines .",
    "the abundances derived for 1082 are 0.2 dex lower than the cluster mean . this can be explained if the second component produces 4050@xmath33 of the continuum flux but only a tiny ( @xmath3410@xmath33 ) contribution to the line flux .",
    "the rotational velocity implied for the second spectral feature is 90@xmath1420 km s@xmath1 , which explains the small contribution to the line flux .    for the first time , we are able to see radial velocity variations in the secondary ( broad - lined ) component amounting to at least 25 km s@xmath1 .",
    "our phase coverage is not good enough to state more than a lower limit .",
    "figure 2 exhibits the series of spectra we obtained of s 1082 on the mcdonald 2.1 m .",
    "the broad component can clearly be seen when compared with the spectra of s 984 .",
    "in addition , the broad component of s 1082 moves redward over the 5 hours the star was observed . for the primary ,",
    "we find a peak - to - peak amplitude of about 5.5 km s@xmath1 . from the data of @xcite ,",
    "there is a peak - to - peak amplitude of about 7 km s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite found from photometry that the system has two partial eclipses per orbit of different depth , with a period of 1.0677978 d. using this period ( or half of it ) , we see no sign of a repeating pattern in the radial velocity data . allowing the period to vary , we find a highest probability period of 1.87 @xmath14 0.05 d , with less likely values of 0.7 d and 2.3 d ( see figure 3 ) . however , none of these periods unveils a satisfactory pattern in the radial velocity data .",
    "we have two sequences of spectra taken on succeeding nights ( centered around phase 0.5 of the photometric period ) that indicate sudden ( @xmath35 h ) jumps in radial velocity for both components .",
    "thus , the radial velocity data imply that we are seeing the signature of material outside of the photospheres of the two stars .",
    "the spectral temperature derived for the narrow component is more than 100 k hotter than the photometry predicts . using the color as the composite temperature for the system",
    ", our spectroscopic temperature suggests that the narrow line component may be 200 k hotter than the broad lined component .",
    "further evidence for a temperature difference between the two components comes from the spectrum : the broad component s high excitation lines of o i have smaller equivalent widths than those of the narrow component , while the low excitation na d lines have higher equivalent widths .",
    "this implies a cooler temperature , although strong fe ii lines may indicate that a lower surface gravity also comes into play . the relatively large brightness ( m@xmath36 ) and hot temperature ( @xmath37 k ) of the secondary indicates that it has probably been severely disturbed by its interaction with the primary .    *",
    "s 2204 ( f 130 ) : * we observed this star initially believing it to be a main sequence star .",
    "evidence indicates that it is very probably a faint blue straggler , and it is identified as such in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "the proper motion studies of @xcite and @xcite cite membership probabilities of 98% and 83% respectively , and radial velocity measurements by @xcite and us put it right on the cluster average .",
    "the photometry of @xcite puts it ( @xmath38 ) over 0.07 mag to the blue of the _ bluest _ stars at the turnoff , and over 0.1 mag from the fiducial line of the cluster .",
    "the quoted mean error in the photometry was 0.016 .",
    "significant contamination of the spectrum by a main sequence companion is not likely since this would either make the star brighter than the turnoff , or closer in color .",
    "a hot , faint companion could also potentially create the observed colors .",
    "although s 2204 was in the field of the ultraviolet observations of @xcite , it was not detected .",
    "their detection of several white dwarf candidates thereby places an upper limit on the temperature of a possible white dwarf companion .",
    "@xcite estimate their detection threshold for a white dwarf with a pure hydrogen atmosphere would be about 21,300 k. a white dwarf below the detection threshold would change the broadband color by a negligible amount .    for stars close to the turnoff , the possibility of delayed star formation ( a very unlikely possibility for brighter blue stragglers ) should be considered . for s 2204 , a delay of more than 1 gyr ( about 25% of the cluster s age ) would be necessary according to the isochrone fits of @xcite if s 2204 is an undisturbed main sequence star . on this basis",
    "we discard the delayed star formation picture for s 2204 .    with the elimination of these hypotheses , the most likely explanation of s 2204 is as a blue straggler of the merged - star or mass - transfer variety .",
    "although there is currently not enough radial velocity information to more strongly test for the presence of a companion to s 2204 , we argue that the primary would be identified as a blue straggler even without one , and that such a companion would not significantly modify the spectrum of the straggler .",
    "* s 821 : * we have detected binary motions for this object with a period @xmath39 d and eccentricity @xmath40 ( * figure  3 * ) .",
    "broad - band photometry places it very close to the fiducial line of the cluster .",
    "this probably indicates that the spectrum is uncontaminated by the companion , although there is a chance that it is composed of two fainter , nearly equal mass stars .",
    "the blue stragglers we have observed can be divided into two _",
    "probable _ categories : mass transfer binaries ( s 975 , s 1082 ) , and collision products ( s 984 , s 997 ) . at present",
    "we do not have enough information to classify s 2204 .",
    "we also have spectra for 5 stars near the main sequence turnoff ( s 815 , s 821 , s 1183 , and s 1271 ) .",
    "our goal is to compare the abundances to see if we can find chemical signatures of the blue straggler formation process .",
    "if significant mixing of a star s envelope has occurred , then the lithium abundance may show the results first since it is consumed at relatively low temperatures ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "@xcite present the most recent compilation of lithium abundances for m67 stars .",
    "our results are given in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "two of our stars ( s 997 and s 2204 ) were previously observed by @xcite , who found upper limits .",
    "we derive upper limits that are 0.5 and 0.8 dex lower , respectively . with the exception of s 984 ,",
    "we are only able to derive upper limits for the stars in our sample .",
    "the values for the main sequence stars are consistent with the lower envelope of lithium abundances ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for references to other papers on m67 lithium abundances ) .",
    "@xcite previously observed the relatively cool blue stragglers s 1072 and s 1082 , while @xcite observed stragglers s 752 , s 997 , s 1082 , s 1263 , s 1267 , s 1280 , and s 1284 .",
    "both sets of authors found only upper limits for their samples .",
    "so , the lithium abundances do not as yet provide a dependable way of distinguishing among different formation mechanisms .",
    "the cno elements can potentially constrain the amount of mixing that occurs in a star , since the cno cycle starts to shuffle abundances at around @xmath42 k. surface material is unlikely to reach this temperature in main sequence stars in the mass range present in m67 , even if violent interactions occurred . however , if mass transfer were to occur on the giant branch , processed material might be dropped onto the surface of the straggler .",
    "our results for carbon and nitrogen are given in table  [ tbl-4 ] , while our oxygen results are found in table  [ tbl-5 ] .",
    "our nitrogen abundances are very uncertain because of the very small equivalent widths found at this temperature , so we will not discuss them further except to note that the nitrogen abundances for the blue stragglers appear to be lower ( 0.2  0.3 dex ) than the abundances found in the turnoff stars .",
    "the carbon abundances for all of the stars in our sample fall very close to the solar ratio . comparing the oxygen abundances of the blue stragglers as a group to those of the main sequence stars ,",
    "the blue stragglers ( dropping s 975 ) also have an average abundance near that of the turnoff stars",
    ". however , several stragglers have anomalously high or low values .",
    "the straggler s 975 is problematic to analyze . on one hand",
    ", the evidence points to mass transfer of the type that could produce an observable chemical signature . on the other hand",
    ", the composite nature of the system appears to be affecting our equivalent width measurements .",
    "the measured o abundance is rather high compared to all of the other stars in our sample .",
    "the expectation is that the mass transfer should lead to a depletion of oxygen if there was cno processing .",
    "the anomalous abundance is possibly due to excess line flux contributed by a companion star or to inaccurate nlte abundance corrections since s 975 lies very near the point where the nlte corrections become large .    for the two stars",
    "( s 975 and s 1082 ) that overlap with the blue straggler sample of @xcite , the agreement of the o i triplet equivalent widths is very good .",
    "we have attempted to test the hypothesis that the blue stragglers and main sequence stars observed all have the same oxygen abundance . as seen in figure 4 ,",
    "the majority of the stars have ews that are consistent .",
    "the exceptions are s 975 ( which appears to have a companion that affects the line flux ) , s 1434 ( b  v = 0.12 ,",
    "ew(o i ) = 1071 @xcite ) ( which also has a high ew , possibly related to a post - main sequence companion inferred from infrared photometry ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and s 968 ( b  v = 0.12 , ew(o i ) = 687 @xcite ) .",
    "s 968 is known to be an am star , which may account for the difference in that case .",
    "however , s 752 ( b  v = 0.29 , ew(o i ) = 754 @xcite ) is also an am star , and it does not appear to have an anomalous equivalent width . finally , we find that s 1082 has a low o ew because of the continuum flux contribution of an nearly equal brightness secondary .    to aid in the interpretation of this figure we compare stars from other studies .",
    "the large crosses are taken from the @xcite study of oxygen along the main sequence of the hyades .",
    "@xcite found a nearly constant abundance along the main sequence .",
    "note the rapid rise in o i ew at @xmath20 ( @xmath43 ) or @xmath12 6840 k due to nlte effects .",
    "the open circles and filled circles represent synthetic abundance analysis employing constant oxygen abundance ( [ o / fe ] = 0.0 ) for several temperature with the nlte corrections of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    to the accuracy of our measurements",
    ", we see no evidence for differences between the abundances of the blue stragglers and the turnoff stars .    in an analysis of two hotter blue stragglers in m67 ,",
    "@xcite found total cno abundances that were lower than those of giants in the cluster .",
    "carbon and oxygen in particular were significantly depleted relative to iron .",
    "none of the blue stragglers in our sample show this pattern of depletion . nor do our blue stragglers show differences in c and o abundances compared to our turnoff stars .",
    "the abundance results are thus consistent with a collisional formation . however",
    ", the low eccentricities of some of the binaries containing stragglers are difficult to explain in that case .      nuclear processing near the hydrogen burning shell of a giant star could produce anomalous abundances in other , more easily observable elements .",
    "surface anomalies in globular cluster giant stars have been observed in a number of globular clusters ( e.g. m3 , m13 , m15 , m71 , m92 , 47 tuc ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the carbon isotope ratio c@xmath44/c@xmath45 in m67 giants is lower than can be predicted by standard evolutionary theory .",
    "however , the required extra mixing does not extend into regions where the oxygen abundance is modified , as is found in metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "in fact , the amount of mixing seen in disk giants @xcite is small in comparison to globular cluster giants @xcite .",
    "na , an element which is burned at a relatively low temperature @xcite , has not been studied well in open cluster giants .    here in particular our ability to discern which stragglers are most likely to be free from contamination is important .",
    "the best candidates ( s 984 and s 2204 ) show fairly minor differences in abundance with the turnoff stars",
    ". we must also be aware that there may also be selection effects in that stragglers that form by some mechanisms may have unavoidably contaminated spectra .",
    "the straggler s 1082 shows abundances that set it off from the other stars in our sample  in particular ni and ba have lower than expected abundances .",
    "the measured iron abundance is _ very _ different from all of the other cluster stars .",
    "the temptation is to think that this may relate to the mass transfer that is inferred .",
    "but as mentioned above this star is part of a binary having a composite spectrum that is difficult to disentangle .        to date",
    "there has not been a detection of lithium in a blue straggler in an open cluster .",
    "there are several possible reasons for this , some of which have interesting consequences .",
    "if two stars were to mix completely during a collision , depletions of a factor of 50 might be expected @xcite because lithium would get diluted throughout the blue straggler .",
    "however , hydrodynamical studies of stellar collisions @xcite indicate that the collision itself is unlikely to mix the stars substantially  the high entropy gas near the surfaces of the input stars remains at high entropy near the surface of the remnant @xcite . as a result",
    ", a collisionally produced straggler is not expected to burn significant lithium initially , even if high enough temperatures are reached @xcite .    for blue stragglers at or above the turnoff of the cluster that were formed via stellar collisions ,",
    "the lithium abundance observed at the surface is therefore likely to be the same as the abundance at the surface of the input star with the higher surface entropy . for main sequence stars , this would be the more massive star .",
    "if the difference in mass of the input stars is relatively large , gas from the lower mass star is likely to be completely sequestered in the interior of the straggler where it would be unobservable .    for open clusters",
    ", it is well known that lithium abundance drops with decreasing effective temperature along the main sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for an open cluster as old as m67 , two - body collisions that produce an identifiable blue straggler could involve a star of as low a mass as 0.6 m@xmath46 as the more massive star . according to standard stellar models ,",
    "main sequence stars with masses less than about 0.8 m@xmath46 are likely to have burned enough of their lithium that it would be undetectable .",
    "standard models are currently unable reproduce the lithium abundance patterns in the hyades though . extrapolating from hyades measurements ,",
    "stars with masses less than about 1.0 m@xmath46 are likely to be undetectable .    while collisions of 0.3 m@xmath46 and a 1.0 m@xmath46 stars could create blue stragglers with observable lithium , two factors work against this .",
    "first , such collisions are relatively rare thanks to the bias in the cluster luminosity function toward stars relatively near the turnoff @xcite .",
    "second , significant main sequence li depletion _ is _ possible after the blue straggler is formed . in the hyades , a dip in lithium abundances",
    "is observed for stars with @xmath47  k ( the total range is about 300 k ) .",
    "it is believed that this feature may be due to meridional circulation or shear turbulence ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "for m67 no current main sequence members fall in this region , but some blue stragglers do .",
    "s 997 and s 2204 fall in the li gap and may have depleted their li even if they arrived on the blue straggler sequence with a significant supply .",
    "the age of the hyades ( @xmath48 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides an upper limit for the lithium destruction timescale for these stars if this mechanism does act .",
    "the lifetime of a blue straggler falling in that range of effective temperatures would be about 3 gyr , in which case there is less than 25% probability of finding lithium .",
    "blue stragglers which form with more helium in their cores ( because the lower mass input star was relatively evolved ) would have higher probabilities of showing lithium , but shorter lifetimes as blue stragglers .",
    "more massive blue stragglers ( @xmath49  k ) would be more likely to retain surface lithium because both the straggler and the input stars lack extensive surface convection zones , and because the stragglers are hotter than the lithium gap .",
    "a possible problem is the mass loss associated with a collision . in hydrodynamical models of globular cluster star collisions by @xcite and @xcite , this mass loss was less than approximately 6% of the total input mass , with the largest mass loss occuring for relatively rare head - on collisions .",
    "however , mass loss would tend to remove the most lithium - rich material ( for example , see table 4 of @xcite ) . for stars with masses between about 1.0 and 1.25 m@xmath46 ( approximately the turnoff mass ) , the lithium - rich regions of the star add up to approximately 4 - 5% of the mass .",
    "blue stragglers formed via binary mass transfer are unlikely to show surface lithium @xcite . in principle , the brighter , more massive blue stragglers are the ones to observe to look for lithium evidence that different mechanisms are responsible for the formation of m67 blue stragglers .",
    "unfortunately , the li line is very temperature sensitive and becomes extremely weak in hot massive stars .",
    "although they are less likely to show the effects of relatively low levels of mixing , cno elements may prove to be more useful in distinguishing between stragglers that have formed by collisions and by binary mass transfer . because the cno elements undergo nuclear processing at higher temperatures than lithium",
    ", it is very unlikely that the surface abundances will be modified as the result of a collisional merger .",
    "massive input stars will not have modified their surface cno abundances because their convection zones are not extensive enough , while low mass input stars will in general become completely engulfed in a higher mass star due to their lower entropies .    on the other hand ,",
    "if algol - type binary mass transfer has occurred ( on the red giant branch or asymptotic giant branch ) , the mass visible at the surface of the blue straggler is taken from deep inside the primary where it could have undergone nuclear processing .",
    "spectroscopy of giant branch stars in m67 shows that first dredge - up modifies surface cn abundances in excess of predictions by standard evolution calculations @xcite .",
    "so almost any amount of mass transfer by a giant is likely to modify surface abundances of blue stragglers formed in this way .",
    "other species like na might also be affected ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the straggler s companion ( the original primary ) is likely to become either a helium or co white dwarf as a result .",
    "this is an improvement over lithium and other light elements in that it is a pattern change and not a destruction of the observable species .",
    "if the companion s contribution to the spectrum can be removed , this could finally provide a means of determining the formation path a blue straggler took .",
    "our spectroscopic analysis of 4 relatively cool blue stragglers does not provide definitive evidence of composition modifications resulting from the formation process . based on lithium abundance patterns as a function of effective temperature for main sequence stars in the hyades and m67",
    ", we find that current upper limits for the lithium abundances of all spectroscopically observed blue stragglers are consistent with no mixing during formation , even though the upper limits fall below measured abundances for turnoff stars .",
    "although the observable o lines are formed under nlte conditions , the o i triplet equivalent widths for stars in our sample and those of @xcite are consistent with constant abundance .",
    "the three exceptions ( s 968 , s 975 , and s 1434 ) may be caused by emission from or absorption by other sources in a binary system .",
    "four of the five blue stragglers and all of the main sequence stars have projected rotational speeds of less than 20 km s@xmath1 , while the fifth straggler ( s 975 ) has @xmath50   km s@xmath1 .",
    "although we are unable to determine the existence of binary companions to some of the blue stragglers in our sample , we are able to provide arguments about the degree of contamination of the spectra of most of the stragglers .",
    "we confirm the spectroscopic detection of a binary companion to the straggler s 1082 . from our spectra",
    ", we measure a projected rotational speed of @xmath0  km s@xmath1 for the secondary , and find that its radial velocity amplitude is at least 25 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the lack of a pattern in the radial velocity data ( and the variability on the order of hours ) provides additional evidence that this system is currently undergoing mass transfer .",
    "the primary is found to be 100  200 k hotter than its companion .",
    "s 1082 may in the end provide us with definitive proof that binary mass transfer can produce blue stragglers .",
