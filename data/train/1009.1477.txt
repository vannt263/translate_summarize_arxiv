    "facing the huge progress at the lhc , with first data taken , and first results already published , it is crucial to have reliable tools at hand for the full simulation of standard model signal and background processes as well as for the simulation of signals for new physics . this task is universally handled by monte - carlo event generators like sherpa  @xcite .",
    "one of the key features of such advanced monte - carlo programs is the possibility to consistently combine higher - order tree - level matrix element events with subsequent parton showers ( me+ps )  @xcite .",
    "this feature has proved invaluable in various recent analyses of data from previous experiments , which are sensitive to large - multiplicity final states . despite being a tremendous improvement over pure leading - order theory , me+ps",
    "merging still suffers from one major drawback of all tree - level calculations , which is their instability with respect to scale variations .",
    "this deficiency ultimately necessitates the implementation of nlo virtual corrections in monte - carlo programs .",
    "two universally applicable methods were suggested in the past , which can perform this task , and whereof one is the so - called powheg algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this technique has been reformulated in  @xcite , such that it can be applied in an automated manner .    having implementations of both , me+ps merging and the powheg method at our disposal , the question naturally arises , whether the two approaches can be combined into an even more powerful one , joining their respective strengths and eliminating their weaknesses .",
    "a first step into this direction was taken independently in  @xcite and in  @xcite . here",
    "we will summarise the essence of the algorithms presented ibidem and exemplify the quality of related monte - carlo predictions .",
    "a formalism allowing to describe both , the me+ps and the powheg method on the same footing was introduced in  @xcite . to compare , and , ultimately , to combine both methods , only the expressions for the differential cross section describing the first emission off a given core process",
    "must be worked out ; this is where the combination takes place .    in a simplified form",
    ", the expectation value of an observable in the powheg method can be described by the following master formula ( for details see  @xcite ) @xmath2\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the nlo - weighted differential cross section for the born phase - space configuration @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the so - called powheg - sudakov form factor .",
    "the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 label parton configurations , see  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is the ordering variable of the underlying parton - shower model and @xmath9 is the respective cutoff .",
    "hence , @xmath8 is one of the variables used to parametrise the radiative phase space @xmath10 .    in a similar manner ,",
    "a simplified master formula for the expectation value of @xmath11 in the me+ps approach can be derived .",
    "it reads ( for details see  @xcite ) @xmath12\\;.    \\end{split}\\ ] ] the terms labelled `` me domain '' and `` ps domain '' describe the probability of additional qcd radiation according to the real - radiation matrix elements and their corresponding parton - shower approximations , respectively . in this context , @xmath13 are the parton - shower evolution kernels and @xmath14 are the parton luminosities of the real - emission and the underlying born configurations .",
    "in contrast to @xmath15 in eq .  , @xmath16 is the uncorrected sudakov form factor of the parton - shower model .    combining the me+ps method with powheg",
    "essentially amounts to combining the two above equations into a new master formula for the menlops approach .",
    "this expression reads @xmath17\\;.    \\end{split}\\ ] ] in order to restore the powheg master formula , the `` me domain '' term would have to be multiplied by the ratio of sudakov form factors @xmath18 only . expanding this ratio to first order",
    "reveals that the above formula automatically yields next - to - leading order accurate predictions for any infrared and collinear safe observable @xmath11 .",
    "in the following we present selected results obtained with an implementation of the menlops algorithm in the sherpa event generator",
    ". in particular we aim at detailing the improved description of data collected in various collider experiments .",
    "we focus first on electron - positron annihilation into hadrons at lep energies ( @xmath1991.25 gev ) .",
    "virtual matrix elements were supplied by blackhat  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ee_fourjetangles ] displays distributions of selected angular correlations in 4-jet production , that have been important for tests of perturbative qcd .",
    "the good fit to those data proves that correlations amongst the final - state partons are correctly implemented by the higher - order matrix elements in the menlops method .",
    "similar findings apply in the analysis of the drell - yan process at tevatron energies ( @xmath191.96 tev ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dy_zpt_jetmulti ] shows the transverse momentum distribution of the reconstructed @xmath20-boson and the multiplicity distribution of accompanying jets , constructed using the d  improved legacy cone algorithm with a cone radius of @xmath21 , @xmath22  gev and @xmath23 .",
    "the agreement of the menlops result with the respective data is outstanding .",
    "we finally present some predictions for the production of higgs - bosons through gluon - gluon fusion and for the production of @xmath24\\;w^-[\\to\\ !",
    "\\mu^-\\bar\\nu_\\mu]$ ] at nominal lhc energies ( @xmath1914 tev ) .",
    "virtual matrix elements for these analyses have been taken from  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ggh_hpt_drjj ] and  [ fig : ww_wwpt_drjj ] .",
    "we observe very small uncertainties related to the intrinsic parameters of the menlops approach .",
    "a detailed discussion is found in  @xcite .",
