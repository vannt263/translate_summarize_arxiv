    "in order to solve the problem of electron thermal conduction in a stochastic magnetic field , one should consider separately two effects that reduce the conduction ( pistinner & shaviv 1996 ; chandran & cowley 1998 ) .",
    "the first effect is that the heat conducting electrons have to travel along tangled magnetic field lines , and therefore , they have to travel longer distances between hot and cold regions of space ( tribble 1989 , tao 1995 ) .",
    "the second effect is that electrons , while they are traveling along the field lines , become trapped and detrapped between magnetic mirrors , regions of strong magnetic field ( chandran , cowley , & ivanushkina 1999 ) .    in our recent paper ( malyshkin & kulsrud 2000 )",
    "we studied the second effect , and we found the reduction of the thermal conductivity parallel to the magnetic field lines , @xmath0 , relative to the spitzer value for the thermal conductivity , @xmath1 , caused by the presence of magnetic mirrors . in this paper",
    "we consider the first effect , and we calculate the further reduction of thermal conduction relative to @xmath0 , caused by the tangled structure of the magnetic field lines . as a result , we obtain the total reduction caused by the both effects , and we calculate the effective thermal conductivity @xmath2 , which one has to apply for astrophysical problems .",
    "it turns out that there is no an universal definition of @xmath2 , and the result depends on the particular astrophysical problem under consideration .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we consider the random walk of tangled magnetic field lines by making use of a diffusion approximation for this random walk .",
    "we find the expressions for the probability distributions of the field line lengths and for the laplace transform , in the field line length , of these distributions . in section  [ model ]",
    "we use the laplace transforms to calculate the effective thermal conductivity for our stationary model of a galaxy cluster . in section  [ t_evolution ]",
    "we consider a time - dependent model and study the time evolution of temperature in a galaxy cluster .",
    "finally , in section  [ discussion ] we discuss our results , compare them with the results reported in previous papers , and consider the applications to cooling flow problem . for two opposite limiting cases our results for @xmath2",
    "are : one is similar to that of tribble ( 1989 ) , and the other coincides to that of tao ( 1995 ) .",
    "in a particularly simple approach , the behavior of tangled magnetic field lines can be considered by using the one - dimensional random walk model suggested by tribble ( 1989 ) . in this model the lines are assumed to random walk between two infinite boundary plates , which are placed at @xmath3 and @xmath4 perpendicular to the @xmath5-direction . in this section we consider this simple model in order to find the probability distributions of the lengths of the field lines in clusters of galaxies ( we then use these distributions to find the effective thermal conductivity in the next sections ) .",
    "contrary to the discrete calculations of tribble , we use the continuum diffusion approximation for the random walk of the field lines .",
    "this allows us to include a weak homogeneous mean magnetic field component into our calculations .",
    "we assume that the mean magnetic field component , @xmath6 , is homogeneous , i.e.  @xmath7 .",
    "let choose the coordinate system in a such way that @xmath6 lies in the @xmath5-@xmath8-plane : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the angle between the mean field component and the @xmath5-direction .",
    "further , assume that the random component of the magnetic field , @xmath13 , is much stronger than the mean component , i.e.  @xmath14 .",
    "let express @xmath5- , @xmath15- and @xmath8-components of @xmath13 in the spherical system of coordinates : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the random component is isotropically distributed , so @xmath19 and @xmath20 are uniformly distributed over @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 respectively . under these assumptions ,",
    "the cosine of the angle between the total magnetic field , @xmath23 , and the @xmath5-direction is = + , [ cos_alpha ] where we keep terms only up to first order in @xmath14 .",
    "let the largest scale of the random component of the magnetic field be @xmath24 .",
    "the largest scale component has more magnetic energy in it than all smaller scale components have .",
    "therefore , the decorrelation length of the total random component is @xmath25 , and over each decorrelation length the random field changes into an entirely new direction . as a result , the mean step and the mean - squared step of the field line random walk in the @xmath5-direction are    rclcl x&= & l_0_,,b & = & ( 2/3)l_0 , + ( x)^2&= & l_0 ^ 2 ^ 2_,,b & = & ( 1/3)l_0 ^ 2    [ delta_x ] over each decorrelation length . here , to obtain these final expressions , we average @xmath26 and @xmath27 over direction and over absolute value of the field random component ( i.e.  over @xmath28 , @xmath20 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "we also introduce the parameter @xmath30 , which is the mean ratio of the magnetic field mean component to the random component .",
    "there is the unique magnetic field line that goes through any given point of space between the two boundary plates .",
    "this field line leaves the point along two branches : a _ positive branch _ that starts at the initial point and goes always in the direction of the local field , and a _ negative branch _ that goes always opposite to the direction of the local field ( see figure  [ fig_picture ] ) .",
    "let consider the following problem .",
    "start at point @xmath31 and follow the positive branch of the magnetic field line going through this point , i.e.  along the field line and always in the direction of the local field .",

    "this is a fokker - planck equation . here",
    ", @xmath38 is the dirac delta - function , and the formula on the second line is the initial condition on @xmath36 , which means we start walking along the field line at @xmath39 . if we now consider the field line s negative branch , which goes always opposite to the direction of local field , then we need to replace @xmath40 by @xmath41 in formula  ( [ diffusion_eq_dimentional ] ) in order to obtain the differential equation for the probability function @xmath42 for this negative branch .",
    "( note , that this replacement corresponds to the substitution @xmath43 for @xmath12 . )",
    "hereafter , we use convenient dimensionless variables = ( 3x_0 ^ 2/l_0)^-1s , = x / x_0 , = x / x_0 , ^=x_0 p^. [ variables ] note that the positions of the boundary plates are @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in these variables",

    "@xmath48 limit the random walk of field lines is controlled by their diffusion in space , and for a given @xmath49 , the functions @xmath50 have considerable spreads in @xmath51 . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath52 , the effect of the mean magnetic field component is large and the `` flux term '' @xmath53 in equation  ( [ diffusion_eq ] ) is dominant . in this large @xmath48 limit",
    "the probability functions @xmath54 stay very narrow in @xmath5 for a given value of @xmath55 , @xmath56 . when @xmath57 , both terms in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ diffusion_eq ] ) are equally important .",
    "thus , @xmath48 indicates whether the influence of the mean field component on the field line random walk is negligible ( @xmath46 ) , important ( @xmath57 ) or dominant ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "equations  ( [ diffusion_eq ] ) need the boundary conditions on the probability functions @xmath50 at the two boundary plates .",
    "let assume for definiteness , that the plate at @xmath44 represents the boundary of a galaxy cluster , the plate at @xmath45 represents the cluster core ( see figure  [ fig_picture ] ) , and the mean component of the magnetic field has a positive @xmath5-component , i.e.  @xmath58 ( clearly the sign of @xmath59 has no bearing on thermal diffusion problem ) . as we said above",
    ", there are two field line branches that we can follow starting at @xmath60 , the positive branch and the negative branch .",
    "each branch random walks in space , and can reach the cluster boundary at @xmath44 and the cluster core at @xmath45 .    let first consider the boundary conditions at the cluster core .",
    "the core is assumed to be much denser and much colder than the rest of the cluster , so we can neglect the temperature @xmath61 in the core and set it to zero . as a result , whenever the positive or the negative branch reaches the core at @xmath45 , it looses its thermal energy and cools down to zero temperature immediately .",
    "therefore , there is no any point in following the field line branches after they first reach the core , and the corresponding boundary conditions on the probability functions @xmath54 at the core are the absorption conditions : @xmath62 .",
    "let now consider the boundary conditions at the cluster boundary .",
    "we assume that the density drops significantly there .",
    "therefore , the random component of the magnetic field also drops considerably at the cluster boundary , because this random component is believed to be created by mhd dynamo action inside the cluster . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean component of the field hardly changes at the boundary , because it is associated with the open magnetic field lines that leave the cluster . as a result ,",
    "the parameter @xmath48 , given by equation  ( [ beta ] ) , increases and becomes large at the cluster boundary ( while the mean field component can still be less than the random component , so that our diffusion approximation is still valid ) .",
    "in other words , we consider @xmath48 to be constant inside the cluster and to become large at the boundary .",
    "therefore , at the cluster boundary @xmath44 , the term @xmath53 in equation  ( [ diffusion_eq ] ) is always dominant . as a result",
    ", the positive field line branch is reflected at the cluster boundary , while the negative branch is absorbed and leaves the cluster .    to summarize , we write the boundary conditions for the positive and negative field line branches as    rl p^-(s,0)=0 , & , + p^-(s,1)=0 , & ;    [ boundary_minus ]    rl p^+(s,0)-(1/2)(^+/)|_x=0=0 , & , + p^+(s,1)=0 , & ,    [ boundary_plus ] see figure  [ fig_picture ] .",

    "the effective conductivity becomes less because very long field lines , which keep the initial temperature , become more important .",
    "we would like to start the discussion with by stressing one of the main results we found : the actual value of this effective conductivity in the tangled magnetic fields depends on how this effective conductivity is defined .",
    "in our paper we used two `` natural '' definitions of @xmath2 for two very simple models of a cluster of galaxies : a time - independent model in section  [ model ] and a time - dependent model in section  [ t_evolution ] .",
    "the results for @xmath2 , reported in figures  [ fig_kappa_eff](a ) and  [ fig_kappa_eff](b ) , are the same only provided @xmath52 , and they are significantly different ( by up to a factor of ten ) when @xmath143 . we conclude that there does not exist an universal result for the effective conductivity in the tangled magnetic fields .",
    "one has to define @xmath2 and to calculate it for a particular astrophysical problem that he / she considers .",
    "we believe that such calculation is possible for many problems , including numerical simulations of galaxy cluster formation and of cooling flows , by making use of our diffusion approximation method for the random walk of tangled magnetic field lines .",
    "it is useful to compare our results for the effective conductivity in the tangled magnetic fields with those reported in previous papers . as we said in the last paragraph of section  [ model ] , in the limit @xmath52 our result for @xmath2 coincides with the result obtained by tao ( 1995 ) .",
    "this simple formula ( for @xmath48 large ) corresponds to lines being in order @xmath144 in length , a result sometimes believed ( remember , that @xmath145 is the ration of the field mean component to the field random component ) .",
    "but in fact , it is only valid as a lower limit on @xmath2 , except for large @xmath48 .",
    "however , we can speculate that it revolves around the very definition of @xmath40 .",
    "we give @xmath40 first and then impose the statistics of the field . if the statistics is given first and the mean field is defined afterwards , as the rms value of the mean field on the scales @xmath146 , then @xmath2 would be closer to our results .    in the limit @xmath46 , our result , @xmath147 , is consistent with the result of tribble ( 1989 ) .",
    ", see his equation  ( 11 ) .",
    "the difference arises because : first , our boundary conditions  ( [ boundary_minus ] ) and  ( [ boundary_plus ] ) for the random walk of field lines are different from those of tribble ; second , the magnetic field lines in our model are allowed to random walk in three dimensions , while tribble considered a restricted one - dimensional random walk . ] to the best of our knowledge , there have no results for @xmath2 when @xmath57 obtained before .",
    "recently chandran and cowley ( 1998 ) have suggested that the diffusion of the heat conducting electrons perpendicular to the magnetic field lines is crucially important for the heat transport . in their model",
    "the statistically independent random step by the electrons is equal to @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the rechester - rosenbluth length .",
    "this length is the distance along magnetic field lines over which a separation between two initially neighboring lines grows exponentially from the electron gyro - radius @xmath150 up to the field decorrelation length @xmath25 ( because of the kolmogorov - lyapunov exponential divergence of field lines ) .",
    "chandran and cowley suggested that the perpendicular diffusion of electrons and this exponential divergence of the magnetic field lines enable the electrons to conduct heat between different field lines , which may enhance the effective thermal conductivity considerably .",
    "however , we believe that the picture considered by chandran and cowley is rigorously valid only if electrons can move a distance @xmath151 along field lines without collisions .",
    "in fact , there are collisions , and if the electron mean free path @xmath152 is less than the rechester - rosenbluth length @xmath151 , the exponential divergence of field lines does not help electrons to diffuse perpendicular field lines . in clusters of galaxies ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath151 to @xmath152 is @xmath153 . as a result ,",
    "the perpendicular heat transport can generally be neglected ( we accept @xmath154@xmath155 as a typical scale for magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies , see kronberg 1994 , eilek 1999 ) . the chandran and",
    "cowley s model can be very important for some other astrophysical problems , but the consideration of their model is beyond of the scope of this paper .    finally , let estimate the importance of the heat conduction for the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters , using figures  [ fig_t_map ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 and the dimensional time @xmath131 , given by equations  ( [ beta ] ) and  ( [ tau ] ) , can be estimated as = 20 , = 510 ^ -6 ^5/2 ^2 ^ 4 .",
    "the reduction of the parallel thermal conductivity relative to the spitzer value , caused by magnetic mirrors , depends on the ratio @xmath156 [ malyshkin & kulsrud 2000 ] .",
    "the typical values are @xmath157 for the hot and low - density halo of a galaxy cluster , and @xmath158 for the cluster central region .",
    "we see that for the halo , where @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , we have @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "thus , according to figures  [ fig_t_map ] , the heat conduction is unimportant there , while according to figures  [ fig_kappa_eff ] , the effective thermal conductivity is reduced by a factor of @xmath165 . at the same time , for the cluster central region we have @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , so the heat conduction is important there , and the effective thermal conductivity is reduced by a factor of @xmath172 .",
    "this conclusion agrees with those of tau ( 1995 ) and of rosner and tucker ( 1989 ) .",
    "thus , with certain parameters , such as these , thermal conduction can be important even with such a large reduction factor .",
    "figures  [ fig_t_map](a ) and  [ fig_t_map](b ) give the direct temperature evolution without reference to reduction factors , and perhaps because of the sensitivity of the reduction factor to its definition , they are probably the more useful expressions of thermal evolution .",
    "suginohara and ostriker in their hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy cluster formation encountered a `` cooling catastrophe '' , which appears as a steep non - realistic rise in the density profile of the relaxed core of a galaxy cluster because of the fast cooling in the core ( suginohara & ostriker 1998 ) . the heat conduction into the core was among solutions suggested by them .",
    "however , they believed that the conduction can be neglected if it is reduced by a factor of @xmath173 or more . in this paper",
    "we find that the thermal conduction is very important in the cluster central region , despite the fact that in our models it is reduced by a factor of @xmath172 .",
    "thus , the conduction should be included in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters , even when the reduction factor is large .",

    "i would also like to thank professors jeremiah ostriker , jeremy goodman and david spergel for their insightful comments .",
