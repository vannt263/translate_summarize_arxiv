    "the need to reconcile the observed small value of the cosmological constant with the value that standard elementary particle theory predicts is a major challenge of theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "a number of years ago , a possible mechanism for relaxing @xmath0 was proposed @xcite .",
    "its essential aspect is the nucleation of membranes ( domain walls ) .",
    "the cosmological constant , which becomes a dynamical field , jumps across the membrane and it is decreased inside it . in the version of the mechanism proposed in @xcite",
    ", the membranes were nucleated through quantum - mechanical tunneling , for which the path integral is dominated by an instanton solution of the euclidean equations of motion . recently",
    "@xcite , a novel variant of this mechanism has been proposed in which the membranes are created through classical thermal effects of de sitter space rather than quantum - mechanically ( see @xcite for related recent discussions ) .",
    "the euclidean solutions relevant to this process were named  thermalons \" .",
    "these new solutions are time - independent in contradistinction with the instantons , which are time - dependent .    in order to obtain additional insight into the thermalons",
    ", we shall examine their analog in the simple possible context of two - dimensional spacetime .",
    "in doing so we encounter yet another fascinating instance of the subtle interplay between gravity , thermodynamics and quantum theory , which becomes apparent in the presence of event horizons .",
    "the most famous instance of this interplay is , of course , the bekenstein - hawking formula for black hole temperature and entropy .    in brief , what we found is the following : if one describes the process in terms of the so - called global coordinates for de sitter space , in which the volume of the spatial sections is proportional to the hyperbolic cosine of time , the nucleation of membranes occurs through the exact analog of the ( @xmath1)-dimensional instanton , as it was already noted in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if one describes the process in terms of the static coordinates for de sitter space , the membranes are nucleated through the thermalon , that is a classical thermodynamical effect .",
    "it is to be emphasized that when we say ",
    "... describes in terms of coordinates ... \" , we are talking about just a change of coordinates in one and the same spacetime : two portions of de sitter spaces of different radii of curvature joined across the membrane .",
    "thus , one and the same physical process appears in one description as a strictly quantum - mechanical tunneling effect and , in the other , as a classical metastability effect ( going over the barrier rather than tunneling through it ) .",
    "there is no paradox here because one may say that when the coordinates are changed , the  potential \" is also changed so the barrier that one tunnels through in one case is not the same barrier over whose top one goes in the other .",
    "it is also quite alright that the thermodynamic description should appear when the static coordinates are used , since it would appear natural to think that time - independence amounts to equilibrium .",
    "to make the discussion self - contained we briefly review here the concept of  thermalon \" .",
    "we also compare and confront it with the concept of instanton .",

    "the equivalence of the two representations does not just happen for the exponent in the transition rate , but in fact for the complete decay rates .",

    "it is just that it is interpreted differently in different coordinate systems .",

    "the actual calculations describing pair creation in a gravitational field have already been done in @xcite . as it was stated in the introduction ,",
    "the main novelty of the present work is the complementary interpretation of the process as a thermal effect .",
    "we will first remind the reader of the results of @xcite in the two  dimensional case and introduce some notation .",
    "the equation of motion to be used for the gravitational field is @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , and @xmath95 a positive coupling ( which would equal @xmath96 in four dimensions ) . in our case ,",
