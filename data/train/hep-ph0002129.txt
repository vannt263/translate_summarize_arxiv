    "it is well known @xcite that photons can be converted into gravitons by a magnetic field in a standard four dimensional spacetime .",
    "the propagation eigenstates are then mixtures of photon and graviton interaction eigenstates . in quantum words ,",
    "this mixing is due to the fact that any particle which has a two  photon vertex can be created by a photon entering an external electromagnetic field @xcite and can oscillate coherently with the photon .",
    "classically , this can be understood by the fact that an electromagnetic plane wave can not radiate gravitationally in vacuum since its stress  energy tensor contains no quadrupole @xcite .",
    "but , a time varying quadrupole appears ( due to interference ) when an electromagnetic plane wave propagates through a constant magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the implications of this effect on the cosmic microwave background ( photons ) has been considered @xcite and it has been shown that it will be undetectable for standard cosmological magnetic fields @xcite . a similar effect also generically happens for axions ( and for any particle having a two  photon vertex ) .",
    "the photon  axion ( see @xcite for reviews on axions ) mixing has yet been studied in details by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) and is used in experiments , since the pioneer work by sikivie @xcite , to put constraints on the axion parameters @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite for an up to date review on such experiments ) .",
    "recently , a lot of interest has been raised by models where the universe has large extra ",
    "dimensions @xcite .",
    "in such models , the planck scale , @xmath0 , is no longer a fundamental scale but is related to the fundamental mass scale of the @xmath1 dimensional theory , @xmath2 , through @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a length scale ( usually taken to be the radius of the @xmath5 compact extra ",
    "dimensions ) and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath2 can be significantly smaller than @xmath7 at the price of having large extra  dimensions .",
    "these ideas can be naturally embedded in fundamental string theories with a low string scale @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier discussions on tev scale extra ",
    "dimensions ) . in these models",
    ", gravity can propagate in the @xmath1 dimensional spacetime ( bulk space time ) whereas the standard model fields are localised on a 3brane .",

    "constraints on the size of these extra  dimensions can be obtained both from the laboratory physics @xcite and from astrophysics and cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the emission of kk gravitons induces an energy loss in many astrophysical objects @xcite such as the sun , red giants and supernovae sn1987a @xcite implying the lower bound @xmath8 ( 2.1 - 9.2 ) tev for the case of @xmath9 ( 3 ) extra  dimensions @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite also have recently investigated the possible presence of axions in the bulk which would be coupled to the brane degrees of freedom .",
    "such a bulk axion also gives rise to a tower of kk - states as seen from a four dimensional point of view .",
    "the goal of this article is to investigate the effects of the photon ",
    "kk graviton and photon  kk axion oscillations and to estimate their effects in cosmology and astrophysics , as well as terrestrial experiments .",
    "since there is a large number of kk states with which the photon can mix , one can expect a departure from the usual four dimensional result .",
    "we first describe (   [ par2 ] ) the photon ",
    "kk graviton system starting from a @xmath1 dimensional action , linearising it and compactifying it to four dimensions .",
    "we also show (   [ par5 ] ) that the photon  axion mixing is described by the same formalism and lead to the same effects as for gravitons .",
    "then , we turn to investigate the mixing in itself . for that purpose ,",
    "we sum up the known results of the mixing of a photon with a low mass particle in four dimensions (   [ par3_1 ] ) and then discuss the most general case of a @xmath1 dimensional spacetime (   [ par3_2 ] ) .",
    "the general expression for the oscillation probability is then evaluated in the particular cases of a five (   [ par3_3 ] ) and of a six (   [ dd ] ) dimensional spacetime .",
    "we show that , as long as one is in a weak coupling regime , one can add the individual probabilities which leads to an enhancement of the oscillation probability if the kk modes are light enough .",
    "we also show that there exists a regime where the photon mixes strongly preferentially with a given kk mode .",
    "we generalise our results to an inhomogeneous magnetic field (   [ par4 ] ) when the probability of oscillation is small , and then turn to the cosmological and astrophysical situations where such effects may be observed .",
    "we study the case of the cosmic microwave background (   [ par6_1 ] ) , of pulsars (   [ par6_2 ] ) and of magnetars (   [ par5_3 ] ) .",
    "we show that even if the enhancement of the oscillation probability can be very important , it is still very difficult to observe this effect in known astrophysical systems .",
    "to finish (   [ par7 ] ) we discuss laboratory experiments and particularly polarisation experiments .",

    ", since the magnetic field varies on a scale @xmath551 , @xmath245 is gouverned by @xmath548 instead of @xmath117 .",

    "we have used the property that , in an external magnetic field , the kk gravitons and axions couple at tree level to photons to show that there exists a mixing between the photon and these particles .",
    "we have computed this mixing and compared our result to the photon - graviton and photon - axion mixings in four dimensions .",
    "the main difference comes from the fact that the mixing matrix is now infinite and that a photon couples to a large number of massive particles .",
    "we then have discussed the physical implications of these phenomena in a general @xmath1 dimensional universe .",
    "this leads us to conclude that for most astrophysical objects the effect of photon - kk gravitons mixing will be unobservable .",
    "+ the main points of this study are :    * we describe how to deal with the mixing between the photon and a large number of light particles .",
    "this extends the former results to the case of @xmath1 dimensional universes where a photon can mix with all the kaluza ",
    "klein gravitons and possibly with bulk axions . in ( [ ppp][y ] )",
    ", we gave the exact expression for the oscillation probability and we then discussed its amplitudes first qualitatively and then in a five and in a six dimensional spacetime .",
    "* when @xmath642 , i.e. if the caracteristic length scale associated with the photon wavelength and effective mass is smaller than the radius of the extra  dimensions , there is a departure from the four dimensional effect .",
    "otherwise , the first kk mode is too heavy to be excited and everything , in general , reduces to the four dimensional situation .",
    "* two limiting regimes have been found : * * a _ large radius regime _ where the two following behaviours can appear * * * in the _ weak mixing _ regime , we have shown that the oscillation probability can be obtained by summing over the individual oscillation probabilities and is then enhanced by a factor of order @xmath217 in comparison with the standard four dimensional case . in that case",
    "the solutions can be found either by solving the eigenvalues equation or by considering the equation of evolution as a schrdinger equation and solving it iteratively in the interaction picture .",
    "the latter method generalises to the case of inhomogeneous magnetic fields but only applies if the oscillation probability is small compared to unity . * * * in the _ strong mixing",
    "_ regime the photon mixes preferentially with a given kk modes , which is possible if the plasma effects dominate over the vacuum polarisation . in that case",
    "a complete transition is possible .",
    "we note that this effect is more likely to happen in a @xmath1 dimensional context than in a four dimensional spacetime and point out a specific effect of the extra ",
    "dimensions on the oscillation length . * * a _ small radius regime _ where @xmath649 so that the spacing between to kk modes is very large compared to the photon characteristic length . in that case , the probability is generally dominated by the contribution of the first state corresponding to the lightest particle and we are back to the four dimensional case .",
    "a consequence of this is that we can have an observable signature of the extra ",
    "dimensions only if @xmath642 . in most of the systems",
    "this can not be achieved , mainly because @xmath117 is very small ; the only favorable situation happens in strong magnetic fields such as in pulsars and magnetars and when we deal with a magnetic field which varies on a small enough typical scale .",
    "* we have shown that , in the case of graviton , the effect of this mixing although enhanced is too small to be observed on the cosmic microwave background and on astrophysical objects such as pulsars . however , we point out that the effects can be larger with bulk axions . *",
    "we discussed laboratory experiments designed for the search of axions in the light of this new framework and we computed the phase shift ( [ p1][p2 ] ) between the two polarisations of a photon entering a magnetic field .",
    "as for the probability , we show that the phase shift is enhanced by the existence of the kk modes . in a periodic field , we show that the effect of the extra  dimensions can be important and that there exists a series of strong and weak mixing regimes that may be observed .",
    "more work to derive bounds on @xmath143 is however needed before drawing any conclusion .",
    "* on a more technical level , we have shown how to diagonalise a general matrix of mixing .",
    "this kind of matrices appears in different situations in extra - dimensions physics and these results can be used in many problems and in particular for neutrino oscillations . * to finish , let us stress some important comments .",
    "first , we have assumed the validity of the euler  heisenberg lagrangian to describe the vacuum polarisation .",
    "one has also to be aware that in strong magnetic fields such as in pulsar magnetosphere , photon splitting @xcite will be in competition with the photon graviton oscillation .",
    "we have not compared the strength of these two effects but we expect the latter to be dominant in high magnetic fields , such as in the magnetosphere of magnetars .",
    "we have also concentrated on gravitational waves even if there is also production of scalar waves .",
    "they are thought to be negligible , at least in the four dimensional case @xcite .",
    "concerning the axions , the effects may be more important than for gravitons , depending on the value of the coupling @xmath143 , but we did not reconsider the bounds on the axion parameters .",
    "further work is needed in that direction .",
    "we also stress that in general one needs a precise determination of their mass spectrum to compute the coupling of each mode to the photon .",
    "most of these results were obtained for @xmath22 or @xmath9 extra ",
    "dimensions for which the results respectively do not , or only weakly , depend on the cut  off of the theory .",
    "we also stress that depending on the exact physical situation the number of kk modes with which the photon can oscillate coherently can be drastically limited in comparison with the number of accessible kk modes .",
    "these decoherence effect implies that the uv cut  off of the theory @xmath21 is expected to be much higher than the physical cut  off .",
    "a consequence of this is that the results obtained in the cases @xmath22 and @xmath9 can be extended to @xmath650 without depending on @xmath21 .",
