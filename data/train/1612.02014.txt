    "_ fermion sector._ before we get to the solution in the presence of the oscillon we note from ( [ eqs : fg_eqns1]-[eqs : fg_eqns2 ] ) and ( [ eq : spinordecomposition ] ) that time evolution couples @xmath14 to @xmath15 , and it couples @xmath16 to @xmath17 . in terms of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes",
    "this means @xmath18 is paired with @xmath19 , while @xmath20 is paired with @xmath21 .",
    "so , we may introduce another basis of functions ( the scattering basis ) that are also solutions for constant @xmath0 .",
    "one of these basis functions is , schematically , [ eq : chi1 ] _ 1&~&e^-itu^(1)(r , k |",
    "h^(2 ) ) + &  & + e^-itr_1u^(1)(r , k | h^(1))+e^itt_1v^(1)(r , k | h^(1 ) ) .",
    "this solution has an extra argument for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , namely @xmath22 , which is to indicate that the @xmath11 of ( [ eq : u]-[eq : v ] ) are to be replaced by spherical bessel functions of the third kind ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this means that they are still solutions to the equations of motion , but are only regular away from the origin .",
    "in fact , we will only be interested in this form at radii @xmath24 , which is where we shall make our measurements of particle number .",
    "note that at large radius , @xmath25 and so corresponds to an outgoing wave , while @xmath26 corresponds to an ingoing wave .",
    "following cohen _",
    "et al _ @xcite we think about wavepackets formed from such solutions , rather than the pure frequency modes , and then we see that at early times ( [ eq : chi1 ] ) should be thought of as an ingoing @xmath18 mode , and at late times it is a combination of outgoing @xmath18 and outgoing @xmath19 , in proportion determined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "unlike the q - balls studied in @xcite , oscillons have varying amplitude , which makes the situation slightly more involved as the time dependence can not be solved by a simple phase dependence . in practise , this means that even if the ingoing wave has a single frequency , the outgoing wave does not , and so contains a spectrum of wavenumbers .",
    "the scattering basis for large radius , @xmath24 , is then    [ eq : chi2 ] _ ( ) ( t , r ; k_in , j , m)&=&e^-i_in t u^()_j , m(r;k_in|h^(2 ) ) + &  & + dk e^-itr^()(k , k_in)u^()_j , m(r;k|h^(1))+dk e^itt^()(k , k_in)v^()_j , m(r;k|h^(1 ) ) , + [ eq : zeta2 ] _ ( ) ( t , r;k_in , j , m)&=&e^i_in t v^()_j , m(r;k_in|h^(2 ) ) + &  & + dk e^itr^()(k , k_in)v^()_j , m(r;k|h^(1))+dk e^-itt^()(k , k_in)u^()_j , m(r;k|h^(1 ) ) ,    and so we expand a general wave operator as in @xcite , [ eq : psi_chi_zeta ] + & & _ , j , mdk_in\\ { b_in()(k_in , j , m)_()(t , r;k_in , j , m ) .",
    "+ d^_in()(k_in , j , m)_()(t , r;k_in , j , m ) } . at this point",
    "it is useful to understand why the operators have been labelled with the subscript  @xmath29 \" . again following cohen _",
    "et al _ @xcite we think about the wave operator in terms of wave packets .",
    "we have that in the far past , only the incoming part of the scattering basis survives ( the terms depending on @xmath26 ) and so the wave operator is indeed a sum of ingoing waves , and the operators @xmath30 , @xmath31 acquire the interpretation as creation operators for ingoing ( anti-)particles .    at late times",
    ", the wave operator will be composed solely of outgoing particles , so at large radius we would write [ eq : psiout ] + & & _ , j , mdk\\ { b_out()(k , j , m)e^-itu^()_j , m(r;k|h^(1 ) ) . + &  &",
    ". + d^_out()(k , j , m)e^itv^()_j , m(r;k|h^(1 ) ) } , and the operators @xmath32 , @xmath33 are creation operators for outgoing ( anti-)particles .",
    "however , we know what the late time , large radius form is from ( [ eq : psi_chi_zeta ] ) and ( [ eq : chi2]-[eq : zeta2 ] ) , so we compare these ( in the late time , large radius limit ) with ( [ eq : psiout ] ) to find    b_out()(k , j , m ) & = & dk_in\\{r_()(k , k_in)b_in()(k_in , j , m ) + t_()(k , k_in)d^_in()(k_in , j , m ) } ,    and a similar relation holds for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these give the bogoliubov transformation between asymptotic in / out creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the number of fermions emitted by the oscillon are found by starting the system in the vacuum state @xmath36 , defined by having no incoming fermions , b_in|0&= & 0,d_in|0= 0 , and we count the number of fermions per unit @xmath37-space at wavenumber @xmath37 , at late times , by evaluating n_out(k)&=&_,j , m0|b^_out()(k , j , m)b_out()(k , j , m)|0 , + [ eq : n_k ] & = & _ , j(2j+1)dk_in|t_()(k , k_in)|^2 .",
    "this term diverges , but the divergence is to be expected as the oscillon is evolving without back - reaction and continues producing particles forever , so in practise one is really interested in @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of fermions produced in time interval @xmath40 .",
    "the effort that goes into finding the rate of ( anti-)particle production , therefore , amounts to determining @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "this is achieved by noting that in terms of the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 appearing in ( [ eqs : fg_eqns1]-[eqs : fg_eqns2 ] ) , we may use ( [ eq : chi2]-[eq : zeta2 ] ) along with ( [ eq : u]-[eq : v ] ) to find the following large radius behaviour for @xmath45 f_1(t , r;k_in ) & = & e^-i_inth^(2)_l_+(k_inr ) + &  & + dkr^(1)(k , k_in)e^-ith^(1)_l_+(kr ) + &  & dkt^(1)(k , k_in)e^ith^(1)_l_+(kr ) , with analogous results for @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "we see , therefore , that if we observe @xmath14 at a given radius @xmath46 , over some time @xmath40 , then we may perform a temporal fourier transform @xmath47 to find @xmath48 .",
    "having set up the formalism , we now need a condensate to create the fermions , and this we address in the next section .    _",
    "scalar sector._ much has been written about oscillons since their discovery @xcite and rediscovery @xcite .",
    "they are localized lumps of oscillating scalar - field condensate , made quasi - stable by non - linearities in the field equations , and may appear , for example , at phase transitions @xcite . due them not being perfectly stable , they radiate energy @xcite and have a lifetime with a significant dependence on the spatial dimension @xcite . ultimately , one is interested in treating the fields quantum mechanically , and results in that direction may be found in @xcite . their relevance to post - inflationary dynamics",
    "is examined in @xcite , and it is found that in a large class of models that exhibit preheating , oscillons can come to dominate the energy density . in this paper",
    "we will not concern ourselves too much with the scalar sector , and will not include the back - reaction of the fermions onto the oscillon , leaving this for a future study .",
    "we shall follow @xcite and take an analytic profile for the oscillons of the form ( t , r ) & = & _ 0(mt ) , which corresponds to a localized , oscillating field distribution .",
    "this profile is derived as an oscillon for the following lagrangian density , [ eqn : scalarlagrangian ] l_scalar & = & -_^-m^2 ^ 2+^4-^6 , with ^2&=&^2_0-^4_0,_c=,^2=1-^2 , + u&=&,_0=_c,_c=. strictly speaking , such a solution is valid only in one spatial dimension in the limit .",
    "the precise results of fermion emission will , of course , be affected by the detailed structure of the oscillon , but we are interested in how fermions react to a generic localized oscillating lump of scalar condensate , and will leave more detailed studies for future work . _",
    "results._ the scalar sector was set out in ( [ eqn : scalarlagrangian ] ) , and we couple this to the fermion , which has free mass @xmath49 , via a yukawa term @xmath50 , giving an effective fermion mass of & = & m_0 + .",
    "one of the important observations made in @xcite@xcite is that the production of massive fermions due to an oscillating scalar condensate can be efficient if the effective mass of the fermions goes through zero at some point during the condensate cycle ; this requires @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the coherent nature of the condensate allows for fermions heavier than the scalar to be produced @xcite@xcite .",
    "the parameters we chose were as follows : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , which leads to an oscillon of radius @xmath57 and energy @xmath58 , with period of oscillation @xmath59 .",
    "for the simulation of ( [ eqs : fg_eqns1]-[eqs : fg_eqns2 ] ) , we used a lattice of @xmath60 points , with a spatial step of @xmath61 , and a temporal step size of @xmath62 .",
    "we should note that the mass of the scalar that forms the condensate is lower than the free mass of the fermion .    in order to evaluate the emission rate",
    "we need the fourier transform of @xmath14 evaluated at a fixed radius , @xmath63 .",
    "we give an example of the mode function @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f_rho_jeq4p5_keq1 ] .",
    "here we see that not much happens until @xmath65 , at which point there is a burst of activity , before settling down to a periodic motion .",
    "the burst around @xmath66 is due to the osciillon effectively being suddenly switched on at the start of the simulation .",
    "we let this burst pass before we start taking the fourier transform , for which we use @xmath67 .     for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the top figure is the real part of @xmath14 and the lower is the imaginary part.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the formalism laid out above now allows us to evaluate the number of fermions per @xmath37-space interval emitted per unit time , @xmath71 , and this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndk ] - for this example we found that the sum in ( [ eq : n_k ] ) had converged by @xmath72 , which is what we use for the figure .",
    "the plot indicates a number of resonance peaks , consistent with the picture one has for a homogeneous condensate @xcite .",
    "for the example in the text.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as well as the spectrum of emitted particles it is of interest to know how many fermions are emitted in total over one cycle , which may be found by performing an integral over @xmath37-space of the spectrum , & = & dk , and in our example yields @xmath73 .",
    "so , over a single cycle of duration @xmath74 our oscillon emits @xmath75 fermions , constituting about 2% of its energy budget per cycle .",
    "based on the observation from preheating studies that a homogeneous oscillating scalar condensate is able to produce heavy fermions , and do so more efficiently than bosons @xcite , we have initiated a study into the fermion production due to mini preheating regions , oscillons .",
    "the basic formalism for calculating the fermion emission was laid out , and an example given using an approximate analytic form for the oscillon solution .",
    "it was shown , by example , that despite the scalar field being lighter than the free - fermion mass , the coherent nature of the oscillon allowed fermions to be produced , and in significant numbers .",
    "the possibility that such oscillons could form at `` low '' energies and yet produce heavy fermions raises interesting questions for baryogenesis , where such heavy fermions may , for example , be heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos .",
    "these would break the @xmath76 symmetry of the standard model , and their decay causes a lepton asymmetry , which leads to a baryon asymmetry due to sphaleron processes .",
    "it is also amusing to consider the possibility that we may one day be able to manipulate a higgs condensate into performing oscillations , thereby producing particles heavier than the scalar itself .",
    "there are still a number of things to be done , one of which is to acquire a more complete picture of how the fermion production is affected by the oscillon s properties , such as its amplitude , size or frequency .",
    "for example , if @xmath77 then fermion production may cease , as their effective mass would never vanish .",
    "another important aspect is back - reaction , whereby the fermion dynamics alters the behaviour of the oscillon .",
    "this has proved an important effect in cosmological preheating , where is has been noted that neglecting back - reaction underestimates the number of fermions produced @xcite .",
    "the fermion coupling may also change the way that oscillons form , with possible incipient fermion production happening during the formation process .",
    "this , however , will require large - scale simulations to gain a full understanding , and is something left for future studies .      99 a.  d.  dolgov and d.  p.  kirilova , sov .",

    "<S> in this letter we bring together the physics of preheating , following a period of inflation , and the dynamics of non - topological solitons , namely oscillons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the oscillating condensate that makes up an oscillon can be an efficient engine for producing heavy fermions , just as a homogeneous condensate is known for doing the same . </S>",
    "<S> this then allows heavy fermions to be produced when the energy scale of the universe has dropped below the scale naturally associated to the fermions .    the period in the early universe following an inflationary epoch can be a rather explosive time </S>",
    "<S> in many models of inflation the universe transforms from a cold , empty , near de sitter phase into a hot environment , via some sort of resonant behaviour of the fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that the inflaton forms a ( nearly ) homogeneous oscillating condensate and some modes of a daughter species , to which the inflaton is coupled , are in resonance with the oscillations , causing their particle number to grow exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> this ( p)reheating scenario has found many uses in early - universe cosmology , including the production of gravitational waves @xcite ; non - thermal phase transitions and the formation of topological @xcite and non - topological defects @xcite@xcite ; baryogenesis @xcite . for fermions </S>",
    "<S> , it was initially believed that pauli blocking would make their production inefficient @xcite , but later studies revealed this not to be the case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distinction between the production of bosons and fermions , in this context , is that the effective mass of fermions can vanish as the condensate evolves through certain values , making their creation much easier than bosons ( see @xcite for a clear comparison of fermion and boson production due to preheating ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was utilised for leptogenesis in @xcite to produce massive right - handed neutrinos , orders of magnitude heavier than the oscillating inflaton field .    </S>",
    "<S> the first studies of fermions coupled to a scalar condensate used a mode function approach , taking the condensate to be homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> this was later extended , using techniques such as those pioneered in @xcite , to include inhomogeneities , as well as back - reaction . </S>",
    "<S> this led to a better understanding of how the homogeneous - condensate assumption underestimates the fermion production rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the decay of oscillons was briefly described in @xcite , but from a different perspective that we pursue here .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to study the localized regions of oscillating condensate known as oscillons @xcite , and focus on how they emit massive fermions . </S>",
    "<S> if we view them is small lumps of preheating - phase physics , we might expect them to be able to emit heavy fermions rather efficiently , just as homogeneous preheating does . in this initial study </S>",
    "<S> we shall ignore the effects of back - reaction from the fermions onto the oscillon , and use techniques introduced by cohen , coleman , georgi and manohar @xcite , and followed up by @xcite . in @xcite the authors examined fermion emission from q - balls @xcite , and calculated the particle production using a bogoliubov - type analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in practical terms , the difference that makes the calculation more involved for oscillons , is that their amplitude is not constant , but this is also what leads to the fermion emission not being just a surface effect , unlike for q - balls @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we shall , however , take it to be spherically symmetric , as the oscillon that contributes to @xmath0 will be taken to be spherical . </S>",
