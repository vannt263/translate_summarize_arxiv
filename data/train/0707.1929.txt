    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method is a numerical method employed to simulate the behavior of correlated electron systems .",
    "it is well known , however , that there are significant issues associated with the application to the qmc .",
    "first , the standard metropolis ( or heat bath ) algorithm is associated with the negative sign problem .",
    "second , the convergence of the trial wave function is sometimes not monotonic , and further , is sometimes slow . in past studies",
    "workers have investigated the possibility of eliminating the negative sign problem@xcite .",

    "the recent developments of high - performance computers have lead to the possibility of the simulation of correlated electron systems using diagonalization .",
    "typically , and as in this study , the ground - state wave function is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian and @xmath3 is the initial one - particle state such as the fermi sea . in the qmd method",
    "this wave function is written as a linear combination of the basis states , generated using the auxiliary field method based on the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ; that is @xmath4 where @xmath5 are basis functions . in this work",
    "we have assumed a subspace with @xmath6 basis wave functions . from the variational principle ,",

    "the method of quantum monte carlo diagonalization lies in the qmc method .",

    "the hamiltonian is the hubbard model containing on - site coulomb repulsion and is written as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath16 at the @xmath17-th site and @xmath18 .",

    "the energy unit is given by @xmath26 and the number of electrons is denoted as @xmath27 .    in a quantum monte carlo simulation ,",
    "the ground state wave function is @xmath28 where @xmath3 is the initial one - particle state represented by a slater determinant . for large @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 will project out the ground state from @xmath3 .",
    "we write the hamiltonian as @xmath31 where k and v are the kinetic and interaction terms of the hamiltonian in eq.([hamil ] ) , respectively . the wave function in eq.([psi ] )",
    "is written as @xmath32 for @xmath33 . using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation@xcite",
    ", we have @xmath34 for @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "the wave function is expressed as a summation of the one - particle slater determinants over all the configurations of the auxiliary fields @xmath37 .",
    "the exponential operator is expressed as @xmath38 where we have defined @xmath39 for @xmath40 @xmath41 the ground - state wave function is @xmath42 where @xmath5 is a slater determinant corresponding to a configuration @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) of the auxiliary fields : @xmath45 the coefficients @xmath9 are constant real numbers : @xmath46 .",

    "since this quantity is not necessarily positive definite , the weighting factor should be @xmath72 ; the resulting relationship is , @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 this relation can be evaluated using a monte carlo procedure if an appropriate algorithm , such as the metropolis or heat bath method , is employed@xcite .",
    "the summation can be evaluated using appropriately defined monte carlo samples , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of samples .",
    "the sign problem is an issue if the summation of @xmath78 vanishes within statistical errors . in this case",
    "it is indeed impossible to obtain definite expectation values .",
    "quantum monte carlo diagonalization ( qmd ) is a method for the evaluation of @xmath79 without _ the negative sign problem_. the configuration space of the probability @xmath80 in eq.([qqmc ] ) is generally very strongly peaked .",
    "the sign problem lies in the distribution of @xmath81 in the configuration space .",
    "it is important to note that the distribution of the basis functions @xmath5 ( @xmath82 ) is uniform since @xmath9 are constant numbers : @xmath46 . in the subspace @xmath8 , selected from all configurations of auxiliary fields , the right - hand side of eq.([qexpe ] ) can be determined .",
    "however , the large number of basis states required to obtain accurate expectation values is beyond the current storage capacity of computers .",
    "thus we use the variational principle to obtain the expectation values .    from the variational principle , @xmath83 where @xmath9 ( @xmath82 ) are variational parameters . in order to minimize the energy @xmath84 the equation @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) is solved for , @xmath87 if we set @xmath88 @xmath89 the eigen equation is @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",

    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath93 , and then calculate the expectation values of correlation functions with the ground state eigenvector ; in general @xmath93 is not a symmetric matrix .    in order to optimize the wave function",
    "we must increase the number of basis states @xmath8 .",
    "this can be simply accomplished through random sampling . for systems of small sizes and small @xmath23",
    ", we can evaluate the expectation values from an extrapolation of the basis of randomly generated states .      in quantum monte carlo simulations an extrapolation",
    "is performed to obtain the expectation values for the ground - state wave function .",
    "if @xmath94 is large enough , the wave function in eq.([wf ] ) will approach the exact ground - state wave function , @xmath95 , as the number of basis functions , @xmath6 , is increased .",
    "if the number of basis functions is large enough , the wave function will approach , @xmath95 , as @xmath94 is increased . in either case",
    "the method employed for the reliable extrapolation of the wave function is a key issue in calculating the expectation values .",
    "if the convergence is fast enough , the expectation values can be obtained from the extrapolation in terms of @xmath96 .",
    "note that although the extrapolation in terms of 1/@xmath94 , or the time step @xmath97 , has often been employed in qmc calculations , however ,",
    "a linear dependence for 1/@xmath94 or @xmath97 will not necessarily guarantee . an accurate extrapolated result .",
    "the variance method was recently proposed in variational and quantum monte carlo simulations , where the extrapolation is performed as a function of the variance .",
    "an advantage of the variance method lies is that linearity is expected in some cases@xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the variance defined as @xmath100 and @xmath101 is the expected exact value of the quantity @xmath65 .",
    "the following brief proof clearly shows that the energy in eq.([vari ] ) varies linearly .",
    "if we denote the exact ground - state wave function as @xmath102 and the excited states as @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , the wave function can be written as @xmath105 where we assume that @xmath106 and @xmath107 are real and satisfy @xmath108 .",
    "if it is assumed that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , the energy is found to be @xmath111 the deviation of @xmath112 from @xmath113 is @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the variance @xmath99 of @xmath2 is also shown to be proportional to @xmath117 if @xmath117 is small . since @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath99 is evaluated as @xmath120 for a constant @xmath121 .",
    "hence if @xmath122 is small it is found that @xmath123 the other quantities can be found if @xmath124 , which leads to the result @xmath125 if @xmath65 commutes with @xmath2 , and @xmath103 are eigenstates of @xmath65 , @xmath126 is proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath127 where @xmath128 ; thus @xmath129 . in the general case",
    "@xmath130\\neq 0 $ ] , @xmath126 is not necessarily proportional to @xmath117 . however ,",
    "if the matrix element @xmath131 is negligible , we obtain @xmath132 this shows that @xmath126 is proportional to the variance @xmath99 .",
    "thus , if @xmath131 is small , we can perform an extrapolation using a linear fit to obtain the expectation values .",
    "we expect that this is the case for short - range correlation functions , since the local correlation may give rise to small effects in the orthogonality of @xmath103 and @xmath102 , i.e. @xmath133 . hence the evaluations of local quantities will be much easier than for the long - range correlation functions .",
    "the simplest procedure for optimizing the ground - state wave function is to increase the number of basis states @xmath8 by random sampling .",
    "first , we set @xmath29 and @xmath94 , for example , @xmath134 , 0.2 , @xmath49 , and @xmath135 , 30 , @xmath49 . we denote the number of basis functions as @xmath6 .",
    "we start with @xmath136 and then increase up to 2000 or 3000 .",
    "this procedure can be outlined as follows : +   + a1 .",
    "generate the auxiliary fields @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) in @xmath139 randomly for @xmath140 for @xmath5 ( @xmath141 ) , and generate @xmath6 basis wave function @xmath8 .",
    "evaluate the matrices @xmath142 and @xmath143 , and diagonalize the matrix @xmath93 to obtain @xmath144 . then calculate the expectation values and the energy variance .",
    "repeat the procedure from a1 after increasing the number of basis functions .",
    "+   + for small systems this random method produces reliable energy results .",
    "the diagonalization plays an importance producing fast convergence .",
    "failure of this simple method sometimes occurs as the system size is increased .",
    "the eigenfunction of @xmath93 can be localized when the off - diagonal elements are small , meaning that some components of @xmath9 are large and others are negligible .",
    "a quotient of localization in the configuration space can be defined .",
    "for example , the summation of @xmath145 except @xmath146 with large @xmath147 is a candidate for such property , @xmath148 where the prime indicates that the summation is performed excluding the largest @xmath147 .",
    "@xmath149 should approach 1 as the number of basis functions is increased . in the case of localization , @xmath150 , where to lower the energy is procedurally inefficient . in order to avoid the localization difficulty there are two possible procedures .",
    "first is to multiply @xmath5 by @xmath139 to improve and optimize the basis wave function @xmath5 further .",
    "second , use a more effective method to generate new basis functions , explained further in the subsequent sections .",
    "the basis functions @xmath8 multiplied by @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) are improved to provide a lower ground state . here",
    "the improvement means the increase of @xmath29 in eq.([psi ] ) which is accomplished by increasing @xmath94 .",
    "the matrix @xmath139 is given by a summation over @xmath153 configurations of @xmath154 . if we consider all of these configurations , the space required for basis functions becomes large .",
    "thus , we should select several configurations or one configuration that exhibits the lowest energy .",
    "one procedure to choose such a state is the following : +   + r1 .",
    "multiply @xmath5 by @xmath155 , where we generate the auxiliary fields @xmath156 for @xmath157 and @xmath138 using random numbers . then evaluate the ground state energy .",

    "this procedure is called the path - integral renormalization group ( pirg ) method .      in order to lower the ground - state energy efficiently ,",
    "we can employ a genetic algorithm@xcite to generate the basis set from the initial basis set .",
