    "one striking feature that is common to all gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is the fact that most of the observed photons correspond to low energy gamma - rays , with energies of a few tens to few hundreds of @xmath0 .",
    "while other features of the bursts , in particularly the temporal structure , vary significantly from one burst to another , this feature seems to be quite invariant .",
    "one wonders , therefore , whether this is a clue to the nature of grbs - a phenomenon that theorists should strive to explain - or if it is just a consequence of an observational bias against detection of harder or softer bursts . in other words",
    ", one can ask whether the observed hardness distribution represents the real one .",
    "@xcite have assumed a simple model for the sources and the detector , and used a sample of 54 relatively strong bursts analyzed by @xcite , to find out if grbs have intrinsic hardness values around @xmath7 , or the observed distribution is just a data selection effect .",
    "they have found that the intrinsic hardness distribution can be extended to include hard bursts with no upper limit .",
    "we calculate the expected observed hardness distribution for several intrinsic hardness distributions .",
    "the calculations include cosmological red - shift and detector characteristics .",
    "we calculate the observed hardness distribution of a set of 136 bursts and we compare the theoretical distribution to the observed one .",
    "we examine which intrinsic distributions are consistent with the data and which are not .    in section [ obs_data ]",
    "we describe our data set , the method used for estimating the spectra and the resulting hardness distribution . in section [ theo_hard ]",
    "we calculate the expected observed hardness distribution from a given intrinsic distribution .",
    "as our calculations deal with cosmological effects on the hardness distribution , we include in section [ corr_dis ] a discussion of the possible correlation between intensity and hardness of cosmological bursts .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we discuss the constrains imposed on the intrinsic distribution by the observed data .",
    "using a count spectrum averaged over the estimated total duration interval for each event , we calculate the photon energy spectra for a group of grbs using the mer / cont data from batse large area detectors .",
    "these data consist of count rates in 16 energy channels spanning a range of approximately @xmath8 , with different temporal resolutions . to estimate the bursts spectra",
    "we must subtract the background .",
    "this background was fitted with a polynom of order one or two on intervals before and after the burst ( @xcite ) .",
    "we limit our sample to bursts that occurred before november 1991 and between february 1992 and january 1993 .",
    "we consider bursts with a minimal peak - flux condition ( @xmath9 ) and require the availability of flux measurements in the 256msec , counts in the 1024msec channel and an estimate of the burst duration .",
    "we consider only bursts that have continuous data for all the duration of the burst , ( the data dropouts is due to telemetry conditions and has no relation to the bursts data , we expect , therefore , that this sample is a proper sample of the grb population . ) .",
    "a total of 136 bursts satisfy these conditions .",
    "the batses lad detector estimates the energy of incident photons .",
    "however , due to various detector characteristics ( @xcite ) , there is no one to one correspondence between the true energy of the photon and the measured one .",
    "the batse team provides for each burst a @xmath10 matrix which describes the detector response to photons at various energies , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the incident photon spectra ( vector length is 62 ) , @xmath10 is the detector response matrix ( size 16 * 62 ) and @xmath13 is the count spectra ( a vector of length 16 ) .",
    "the counts spectra must be transformed into a photon spectra .",
    "a direct inversion is impossible as it is well known that the inverse matrix is singular .",
    "we have used the forward folding method .",
    "this is a model dependent method .",
    "one assumes that the photon spectra is well described by a given functional shape with some unknown parameters , ( we have used the band parameterization ) . for a given set of parameters ,",
    "the assumed spectral form is integrated into the @xmath10 spacing , multiplied by the @xmath10 , and compared with the measured count vector .",
    "then , we use the @xmath14 optimization method to find the parameters that fit best the measured count vector .      with the necessity of a assuming a spectral form , we follow @xcite , by characterizing the bursts spectra using a four parameter function : @xmath15^{\\alpha } e^{-e / e_0 } & $ e<(\\alpha-\\beta)e_0 $ \\cr { a / 100\\kev } \\left [ { ( \\alpha-\\beta)e_0 / 100\\kev } \\right ] ^{\\alpha-\\beta}e^{\\beta-\\alpha } \\left [ { e / 100\\kev } \\right ] ^\\beta & $ e>(\\alpha-\\beta)e_0 $ } \\ ] ] this function , which provides a good fit to most of the observed spectra , is characterized by two power laws joined smoothly at a break energy @xmath16 .",
    "for most of the observed values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 rises below @xmath20 , and decrease above it .",
    "the energy @xmath21 is thus the `` typical '' energy of the observed burst .",
    "note that the hardness ratio in batse catalogue , which is the ratio of photons observed in channel 3 to those observed in channel 2 , is different from @xmath21 defined in this way .",
    "the total energy of a burst described by this spectral form depends on the hardness of the burst , and on its power - law slopes . using @xmath22",
    ", we calculate the total energy of a burst @xmath23 . \\label{total_energy}\\ ] ] the observed hardness distribution of our sample appears in fig .",
    "[ hard_dist ] together with the hardness distribution of the sample of @xcite .",
    "fig 2 . shows the distribution of the lower energy power - law parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we use the total duration of the bursts to produce photon spectra .",
    "the known hard to soft evolution causes the hardness distribution to be softer then the hardness distribution at the peak of the bursts , which is needed for detection statistics .",
    "we ignore this effect .",
    "inclusion of it will make the intrinsic hardness distribution even harder than our estimates .",
    "to calculate a theoretical `` observed '' hardness distribution , we must assume a model for the hardness intensity statistics of the sources . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume : ( i ) standard candle in peak energy flux , ( ii ) no hardness vs. intensity correlation .",
    "we believe that this is the simplest possible ad - hoc model .",
    "one can easily imagine physical processes that will lead to this situation .",
    "for example , within the relativistic fireball model ( @xcite ) such a behavior will arise if we keep the total energy of the fireball fixed and vary the lorentz factor of the relativistic motion .",
    "( iii ) we also assume a simple form of the intrinsic hardness distribution : @xmath24 where the index @xmath4 is such that if @xmath25 there are equal number of bursts per logarithmic interval of h between @xmath26 and @xmath27 . if @xmath28 , then there are more hard bursts then soft ones .",
    "we also assume that for all bursts @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are the average values of our sample .",
    "( later , after we find the intrinsic hardness distribution which fits the observed data the best , we check the sensitivity to a distribution of power - law indices .",
    "see section [ spect_diver ] ) .    in order to produce a set of bursts with the same total energy we calibrate the spectra by setting the constant @xmath31 in equation [ total_energy ] to hold @xmath32 fixed for all the bursts .",
    "we calculate the distribution of observed hardness , which is @xmath33 \\psi(z ) dz , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the proper volume of a shell extending from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , compensated for event count rate , assuming constant rate of grbs per proper time per comoving volume and @xmath37 .",
    "the detection function @xmath38 states if the burst with hardness @xmath39 is observable with our detector .",
    "the main batse triggering algorithm uses only counts in the region @xmath40 ( cf .",
    "discussion in section [ drm_inc ] ) . with these assumptions , @xmath41 - c_{min } } \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the peak rate of photons the detector receives from a source at red - shift @xmath35 in the interval @xmath43 ( the batse detection window ) at 1024msec .",
    "the @xmath44 to @xmath45 range ( channels 2 & 3 of batse ) is a feature of the batse triggering algorithm .",
    "clearly a triggering algorithm based on different batse channels will result in different data selection effects .",
    "the sources are normalized as standard candles in peak luminosity using equation [ total_energy ] .",
    "for simplicity we use a fixed count threshold , @xmath46 .",
    "we then use the @xmath14 method to find which parameters ( @xmath26,@xmath27,@xmath4 ) fits the observed distribution the best .",
    "the best fit parameter for our data set are @xmath47,@xmath48 .",
    "the upper cut - off of the hardness distribution , @xmath27 is not constrained by current data .",
    "this intrinsic hardness distributions agrees with @xcite , in that the observed hardness distribution is compatible with a large number of non - detectable mev bursts , and the apparent upper - cut off arises from data selection effects .",
    "it is interesting to check whether one can overcome the data selection effects by modifying the triggering algorithm , or are the selection effects inherent triggering algorithm that depends on counts .",
    "we model three different possible algorithms , based on different photon energy ranges : ( i ) 50 - 300 kev ( currently the main batse algorithm ) ( ii ) 50 - 2000 kev and ( iii ) 300 - 2000 kev .",
    "we assume that the hardness distribution is given by eq .",
    "[ h_intr ] with @xmath49 and @xmath47 kev .",
    "we also assume that the spectrum for the underlying noise behaves like @xmath50 .",
    "we calculate the distribution of hardness expected with this intrinsic distribution and these three different triggering algorithms ( see fig . [ triggering ] ) .",
    "we find that inclusion of the the 300 - 2000kev channel increases the overall rate of observed bursts by 12% compared to triggering on the 50 - 300 kev alone .",
    "using only the 300 - 2000kev leads to a decrease in the total rate by 10% ( this last number depends rather sensitively on the lower cut off chosen in the intrinsic hardness distribution ) .",
    "what is more important is that even while triggering on the 300 - 2000 kev photons , there is still a large difference between the observed distribution and the intrinsic one ( see fig .",
    "[ triggering ] ) .",
    "this shows that the inherent problem in detecting harder bursts is the decrease in the total number of photons as the hardness increases which is not compensated by an equivalent decrease in the noise .",
    "the detector response matrix translates the spectrum of incident photons to the measured spectrum of counts .",
    "( see section [ spect_estim ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath42 in eq .",
    "[ psi ] ignores the drm and uses instead the identity matrix . in order to check this effect ,",
    "we take an arbitrary drm ( burst 3b920226 ) and define a modified count function @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the drm photon spectra boundaries , and @xmath53 spans all the count channels with energies from 50 kev to 300 kev . in table [ table1 ] we show the drm effect on counts , for bursts with various hardnesses .",
    "using this modified count function , we recalculated eq .",
    "a sample @xmath54 distribution ( see fig . [ hard_dist ] ) , with drm inclusion , shows increasing number of hard bursts which results from hard photons that are measured as softer ones .",
    "we see that this effect does not change the distribution significantly .",
    "the spectral shape of a burst in the low energy regime , i.e. the power - law parameter @xmath17 , can determine if the detector detects the burst or not , even if the hardness is constant . a hard burst with average",
    "@xmath17 might not be detectable .",
    "a burst with the same hardness but lower @xmath17 , has more photon in the detector window , and can be detected .",
    "@xcite found a negative correlation between hardness and the parameter @xmath17 , which can be explained by this effect .",
    "we proceed to evaluate the sensitivity of our previous calculation to diversity in @xmath17 .",
    "we calculate the expected observed hardness distribution for intrinsic hardness distribution and intrinsic distribution of the @xmath17 , where for the later we take the observed one ( see fig .",
    "[ alpha ] ) .",
    "it appears from fig .",
    "1 , that the modified hardness distribution is slightly softer , which can be explained by the population of bursts with a higher @xmath17 then the average one .",
    "we find that this spectral diversity does not change our results significantly .",
    "it is generally assumed that positive correlation between fluence and hardness should appear if the bursts are cosmological . however , while looking for this correlation one should beware of correlating between parameters which have an inherent correlation induced by their estimation method ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , assuming that @xmath17 & @xmath18 are constants for all bursts , equation [ total_energy ] becomes @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the fluence , @xmath57 is the photon count , and @xmath21 is the bursts hardness . assuming that there is no intrinsic correlation between the photon counts and hardness , and that the distribution function are `` well behaved '' , we define the spread in hardness and counts by @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "then the correlation coefficient between fluence and hardness is @xmath60 the result depends on the distribution of @xmath21 and @xmath57 , but it is always positive , and it can have an arbitrary positive value without any intrinsic correlation .    in the case of standard candles with an intrinsic hardness cosmological effects",
    "lead to a one to one relation between counts and observed hardness , and a positive correlation between them is inevitable .",
    "however , consider a population of grbs in a certain red - shift @xmath35 , with a hardness distribution .",
    "the correlation between hardness and counts would be _ negative _ , because ( for standard candles ) the harder bursts emit less photons , and even less photons inside batses triggering interval .",
    "what should we expect from grbs which are spread over the universe _ and _ have an intrinsic hardness distribution ?",
    "[ corr ] shows the average hardness as a function of counts for two intrinsic hardness distribution in the form of eq .",
    "[ h_intr ] ( we prefer to use counts rather than intensity , due to the usage of the bursts spectra while calculating its intensity ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "both curves are for a constant number of grbs per logarithmic hardness interval .",
    "the descending curve corresponds to hardness distribution with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and the ascending curve to hardness distribution with @xmath61 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see that even a mild hardness distribution masks cosmological effects ( recall that a hardness distribution with @xmath61 and @xmath63 is too narrow to fit the observed one ) .",
    "thus , the large observed hardness distribution disables the usage of hardness - intensity relation as an independent probe for the bursts cosmological origin .",
    "we find a correlation coefficient smaller then @xmath64 between hardness and peak flux .",
    "this result agrees with @xcite who have found a correlation coefficient of @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite have found a marginally significant correlation ( 0.9 ) . in fig .",
    "[ udi_mal ] we compare the hardness - intensity relation in our and @xcite samples .",
    "the intensity is the peak flux in 256msec channel from batses catalog .",
    "it is not clear if the two data sets are discrepant or not .",
    "this warrants further investigations .",
    "a comparison between the expected hardness distribution for various intrinsic hardness distributions , and the observed distribution reveals the necessity for intrinsic paucity of soft bursts . any intrinsic distribution",
    ", that does not include an intrinsic paucity in this area , does not fit the observed distribution .",
    "therefore , unless batse has an unexpected and unknown selection bias against soft photons , the lower cut - off in the observed distribution is a real phenomenon . using a best fit method",
    ", we found that the observed data is best modeled by intrinsic lower cut - off at @xmath66 .",
    "the story is , however , very different for large values of h. the data show very small numbers of hard bursts , e.g. , only two bursts out of 54 bursts in the band et .",
    "1993 ) sample and only five bursts out of 136 in our sample are harder than @xmath67 mev .",
    "nevertheless , this does not mean that there are fewer grbs above @xmath67 mev .",
    "the best fitted intrinsic hardness distribution , is one with @xmath48 , i.e. a slowly decreasing number of bursts per logarithmic interval .",
    "even a model with @xmath25 , i.e. a constant number of bursts per logarithmic hardness interval gives a probability of 15% in a ks test , which is not high but is not sufficiently low to rule out the model .",
    "the interpretation of the result is quite simple .",
    "there is an observational bias against detecting bursts with @xmath68 by current detectors .",
    "two factors operate . for bursts with a fixed luminosity ,",
    "harder bursts have fewer photons .",
    "this makes the detection of harder bursts difficult in any detector that is triggered by photon counts .",
    "( if the energy of the detector noise per decade is constant , then the the ratio between the number of photons in the burst and in the noise remains constant .",
    "however , the noise variance decreases slowly with energy ( square - root of the total noise ) , and the signal to noise decreases . )",
    "the decrease in sensitivity in batse is even more severe since batse triggers on photons in the @xmath44 to @xmath45 range and as the bursts become harder most of the emitted photons are further and further away from this energy range",
