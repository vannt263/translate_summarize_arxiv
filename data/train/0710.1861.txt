    "in the preceeding paper  @xcite , referred to hereafter as paper i , we presented global representations of the three ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) complex - valued potential - energy surfaces of the metastable states of h@xmath0o@xmath4 that underlie dissociative electron attachment to water .",
    "this paper is concerned with the calculation of the cross sections for that physical process .",
    "prior experimental and theoretical results @xcite have characterized the various breakup channels and determined the spatial symmetries of the three metastable electronic states of h@xmath0o@xmath4 , the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 electronic feshbach resonances , which are responsible for production of h@xmath4 and o@xmath4 . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite and paper i , the energetically lowest h+oh@xmath4 channel does not directly correlate with any of the three feshbach states .",
    "we therefore conclude that oh@xmath4 production is due to nonadiabatic effects .",
    "we pursue this problem theoretically using a coupled born - oppenheimer treatment of the nuclear motion .",
    "the first task , which was described in paper i , is the construction of three - dimensional , complex - valued potential - energy surfaces for these three states , which have a negative imaginary component due to the finite probability of electron autodetachment back to h@xmath0o+@xmath5 .",
    "these complex - valued potential - energy surfaces , which are functions of the nuclear geometry @xmath6 , are defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the resonance position and @xmath9 is the width of the resonance , which is related to the lifetime by @xmath10 .",
    "( we use atomic units throughout this paper . ) the present article , which we label paper ii , is concerned with the use of these potential curves within the local complex potential ( lcp ) model @xcite to calculate the nuclear dynamics leading to dissociation .",
    "the analysis of the dynamics yields the dea cross section as a function of incident electron energy .",
    "we must account for two major nonadiabatic physical effects in calculating the quantum dynamics of the nuclei .",
    "as described in paper i , the three potential - energy surfaces have several degeneracies that lead to coupling among them .",
    "first , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states become members of a degenerate @xmath11 pair in linear geometry , and for this reason there will be renner - teller coupling between them .",
    "we expect this coupling to be relevant for dea via the @xmath2 state , because the gradient of its potential - energy surface will cause the system to move toward linear geometry after the electron attaches .",
    "second , there is a conical intersection  @xcite between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 states which leads to coupling between them .",
    "for this reason , as described in paper i , we constructed a set of diabatic @xmath3 and @xmath2 surfaces , along with a coupling term , which we use in the calculations presented in this paper .    in fig .",
    "[ c2vfig ] , we show the real parts @xmath8 of the constructed potential - energy surfaces along a two - dimensional cut which includes the equilibrium geometry of the neutral ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ) .",
    "the degeneracies that lead to the nonadiabatic effects listed above can be seen in this figure .",
    "the two - dimensional cut depicted is that for which the two oh bond lengths are equal ( @xmath14 ) , corresponding to @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "( in @xmath15 symmetry , the adiabatic and diabatic @xmath2 and @xmath3 surfaces coincide . )",
    "the backside of this cut lies at @xmath12 , which is the equilibrium value of the bond lengths in neutral h@xmath0o , and is marked with solid lines .",
    "the surfaces extend forward in fig .",
    "[ c2vfig ] along the symmetric stretch direction to geometries at which @xmath16 . the conical intersection comprises the set of points along which the @xmath2 and @xmath3 surfaces intersect . the renner - teller degeneracy between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states occurs at @xmath17=180@xmath18 .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ c2vfig ] shows only one cut of the potential - energy surfaces , and only their real part , it is useful for introducing certain features of these surfaces and the dynamics that will result .",
    "dissociative attachment via the lower @xmath1 and @xmath2 states leads primarily to the product h@xmath4+oh ( x @xmath11 ) .",
    "the two oh bond lengths for such an arrangement are unequal , and therefore this product arrangement can not be seen in fig . [ c2vfig ] .",
    "however , we can see that at the equilibrium geometry of the neutral , the @xmath1 surface is relatively flat with bend , while the @xmath2 surface slopes steeply downward toward linear geometry ( @xmath17=180@xmath18 ) . as a result",
    ", the dynamics beginning on the @xmath2 surface will lead toward linear geometry , and we expect that the renner - teller coupling between these two states will be more important for dea via the @xmath2 than via the @xmath1 state .    the channel h@xmath0+o@xmath4 is the minor channel for dea via the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , but the major channel for the @xmath3 state .",
    "we can see why this is the case from fig .",
    "[ c2vfig ] ; the gradient of the @xmath3 ( 2 @xmath19 ) surface leads downward toward the conical intersection , where the system may make a nonadiabatic transition to the lower surface and access the clearly visible h@xmath0+o@xmath4 well on the 1 @xmath19 ( lower cone ) surface .",
    "the 2 @xmath19 surface does not have a low energy asymptote in this geometry , instead correlating to o@xmath4+h@xmath0 ( @xmath20 ) .",

    "dissociative electron attachment to water molecules has been the subject of previous experimental investigation , starting as early as 1930  @xcite , and as recently as the past year ( 2006 )  @xcite .",
    "early experiments on dissociative electron attachment to h@xmath0o focused mainly on the identification of the negative ion species formed , the measurement of the total cross sections , and the energy locations of the structures in the resonance process  @xcite .",
    "buchelnikova  @xcite and schultz  @xcite established that the main products of dissociative electron attachment to water are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with the production of @xmath22 being almost ten times smaller than that of @xmath21 at lower energies , but with @xmath22 dominating at higher electron - impact energies .",
    "both compton and christophorou  @xcite and melton  @xcite carried out comprehensive studies of negative ion formation in water and measured absolute cross sections for dea .",
    "three resonance peaks were observed .",
    "@xmath21 production was observed at approximately 6.5 ev and 8.6 ev , with the second peak much less intense than the first .",
    "the species @xmath22 was observed in increasing intensities in three peaks at 7.0 ev , 9.0 ev , and 11.8 ev  @xcite .",
    "the species oh@xmath4 is also observed in the dissociative electron attachment experiments , though at an intensity one order of magnitude below the minor o@xmath4+h@xmath0 channel , which is itself observed at an intensity approximately one order of magnitude lower than the dominant h@xmath4+oh channel .",
    "melton  @xcite argued that oh@xmath4+h was a true channel of dissociative electron attachment to h@xmath0o molecules , while in subseqent studies ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) it was argued that oh@xmath4 is produced by dea to water clusters [ h@xmath0o]@xmath23 .",
    "the question of oh@xmath4 production has been reexamined in the recent experimental study of fedor _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "these authors have concluded that , indeed , it is a direct product of dissociative electron attachment to water .",
    "this minor channel is not examined in the present treatment , and no mechanism has , as yet , been advanced .",
    "the effects of isotopic substitution have also been an issue of some debate .",
    "the replacement of h@xmath0o by d@xmath0o as the molecular target has the effect of nearly doubling the reduced masses corresponding to oh ( od ) bond motion .",
    "one would expect , at least in a simple one - dimensional picture , that the nuclear dynamics may be substantially altered by such replacement , and in particular , the time to dissociation is increased . a longer dissociation time allows a greater amount of electron autodetachment to take place ; therefore , performing the same experiment with different isotopic variants provides information on the lifetime of the electronic state involved .",
    "the cross sections for dea via both h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o were measured , compared , and discussed in detail by compton and christophoreau  @xcite .",
    "a smaller peak cross section for d@xmath4 production than for h@xmath4 production via the lowest - energy @xmath1 state was observed . on the basis of these results",
    ", these authors derived an approximate lifetime of 2.1 @xmath24 10@xmath25 seconds for the lowest - energy @xmath1 feshbach resonance .",
    "we have already published an initial study of dea via this state  @xcite , which arrived at results and conclusions much different from those of ref .",
    "the calculated results yielded a higher peak cross section for d@xmath4 production via the @xmath1 resonance than for h@xmath4 production , and a similar energy - integrated cross section , in stark contrast to the results of compton@xcite .",
    "the calculations indicated a larger lifetime of 10.9 @xmath24 10@xmath25 seconds for the @xmath1 state , and the nuclear dynamics that we calculated indicated that only a small portion of the dissociating anion flux is lost to autodetachment .",
    "the recent experimental results of fedor _ _ et al.__@xcite have substantially resolved this controversy .",
    "these authors obtain results different from those of ref .",
    "@xcite , reversing the trend in peak heights for h@xmath4 versus d@xmath4 production via the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "they observe a higher peak for d@xmath4 production than for h@xmath4 production , which brings the current experimental and theoretical results into qualitative agreement .    although the peak heights provide considerable information about the physical process of dissociative electronic attachment to water , further information",
    "is gained by resolving the angular dependence of the fragments produced , and the final ( ro)vibrational state of the diatomic fragment .",
    "a series of measurements by trajmar and hall @xcite and belic , laudau , and hall @xcite revealed the energy and angular dependence of @xmath21 in dissociative electron attachment to @xmath26 .",
    "the determination of the angular dependence aided the assignment of the spatial symmetries of the three resonant states , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , which had previously been misassigned . by resolving the kinetic energy of the h@xmath4 fragment ,",
    "this experiment yielded information about the vibrational and rotational state distribution of the oh fragments .",
    "curtis and walker  @xcite measured cross sections for dissociative electron attachment to d@xmath0o and obtained two important results . by measuring the kinetic energy of recoil of the d@xmath4 fragments produced , these researchers established that both ground state od ( @xmath11 ) and excited od ( @xmath30 ) accompany the d@xmath4 anions produced within the third resonance peak , and that the three - body breakup channel d@xmath4+d+o is observed toward the high - energy tail of the second peak .",
    "the experimental studies determined that there are three metastable electronic resonance states of the h@xmath0o@xmath4 anion , the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , which are primarily responsible for dissociative electron attachment to water .",
    "these three electronic states correspond to the three peaks seen in the experimental cross sections . although the third peak is not obvious in the h@xmath4 cross sections , it is present , though much smaller than the first and second peaks .",
    "several salient features of the early experiments suggest that the nuclear dynamics of this process may hold some surprises . for dissociative attachment through the @xmath1 resonance ,",
    "the cross section for producing @xmath31 is roughly 40 times larger at its peak than the cross section for producing the energetically favored products , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the lowest - energy atom / diatom arrangement , @xmath33 , is produced in even smaller quantities .",
    "in addition , the branching ratios for the different product states vary greatly depending on which feshbach resonance is formed by the attachment .",
    "these observations indicate that the products of this reaction are determined by the dynamics of the process itself rather than by the energetics of the possible product channels , and that moreover those dynamics are different for each of the resonance states of the water anion .",
    "the detailed experiments of belic , landau and hall @xcite in 1981 indicated that the dissociation dynamics involve correlated motion among multiple degrees of freedom . for instance , the channel producing @xmath31 through the @xmath1 resonance state is accompanied by extensive vibrational excitation of the oh fragment .    therefore , given the competition between dissociation channels and the observed product vibrational excitation , one expects that the dynamics of dissociative attachment to this molecule are intrinsically polyatomic , and can only be described theoretically by a treatment using the full dimensionality of nuclear motion .",
    "compared with the large number of experimental measurements , detailed theoretical work on dissociative electron - water collisions has been relatively scarce .",
    "the paucity of theoretical work on da stems from the fact that , in water , da proceeds , not through tunneling shape resonances , but through feshbach resonances that involve changes in the electronic structure of the target .",
    "early theoretical work focused on the electronic structure  @xcite and configuration - interaction  @xcite calculations on various states of @xmath34 that are possible resonances .",
    "these calculations , together with experimental observations , formed the basis of the assignment of the three feshbach resonances that are responsible for electron - impact dissociation of water in the gas phase .",
    "contemporary theoretical work has included _ ab initio _",
    "complex kohn  @xcite and @xmath35-matrix  @xcite calculations , at the equilibrium nuclear geometry , of the resonances and excitation cross sections into low - lying dissociative electronic states .",
    "more recently , gorfinkiel , morgan , and tennyson  @xcite carried out @xmath35-matrix calculations of dissociative excitation of water through the four lowest excited states ( the @xmath36 and @xmath37 states ) . a limited study of the effects of nuclear motion were included in that work by increasing one of the oh bonds while keeping the equilibrium hoh bond angle and the other oh bond length constant . the only theoretical work on the dynamical aspects of dissociative electron attachment to water",
    "are earlier classical trajectory analyses based on either repulsive  @xcite or attractive  @xcite model resonace surfaces .",
    "we previously reported calculations of the cross sections for dissociative attachment through the lowest - energy @xmath1 resonance  @xcite that incorporated a full quantum treatment of the nuclear motion of the resonant state .",
    "that study found good agreement with experiment for dissociative attachment through the lowest resonance state ( @xmath1 ) of the water anion to produce h@xmath4 , and it established that the associated dynamics are intrinsically polyatomic and thus can not be described successfully by one - dimensional models .",
    "the present treatment supersedes our earlier study and extends the treatment to include the higher resonance states as well .",
    "we have recently presented a qualitative study  @xcite of the potential - energy surfaces for the three feshbach resonances , which demonstrated that for these metastable , anion states , there exist numerous intersections and degeneracies within the adiabatic manifold .",
    "this study identified the conical intersection between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , as well as a novel degeneracy between the @xmath3 feshbach resonance and a @xmath3 shape resonance .",
    "this degeneracy defines a branch seam , and the two resonance energies are seen to comprise two components of a double - valued adiabatic potential - energy surface .",
    "this seam and the resulting dynamics may have an effect upon the three - body , h+h+o@xmath4 cross section , although we do not include it in the present treatment . finally , in a separate publication  @xcite , we derived a `` constant - eigenmode approximation '' and used it to calculate the angular dependence of the h@xmath4 fragment production  @xcite via the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "we found excellent agreement with the results of belic , landau and hall  @xcite , and demonstrated that the observed angular dependence is a result of partial - wave mixing in the resonance - background coupling .",
    "we treat the nuclear dynamics of dissociative electron attachment within the local complex potential model .",
    "this model is concerned with the proper accounting for the decay of the resonant state , and its effect upon the nuclear dynamics .",
    "the lcp model includes the simplest such accounting , in which the decay rate is a local function of the nuclear geometry .",
    "the local complex potential model  @xcite , also known as the `` boomerang '' model when applied to vibrational excitation , describes resonance nuclear motion by an inhomogeneous schrdinger equation and a complex , but purely local potential .",
    "it is perhaps easiest to derive by applying feshbach partitioning  @xcite within the born - oppenheimer framework to derive a nuclear wave equation  @xcite .",
    "the derivation begins by defining a discrete ( square - integrable ) approximation to the resonant electronic state , @xmath38 which depends parametrically on the nuclear coordinates @xmath6 and which is unit - normalized with respect to integration over the electronic coordinates @xmath39 .",
    "one then defines the geometry - dependent feshbach projection operator @xmath40 , which operates on the electronic degrees of freedom , @xmath41 \\big [ \\psi_q(\\vec{q } ) \\big\\vert , \\ ] ] and its complement @xmath42 : @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "the residue of this green s function gives the level - shift operator @xmath60 a negative - definite imaginary component .    in order to bring eq.([transcendental3 ] ) into the form of the local complex potential model , it is necessary to make a local approximation to the level - shift operator @xmath60 , and also to approximate the driving term .",
    "the assumptions that underlie these approximations are well understood  @xcite . a local approximation to the level - shift operator yields @xmath61 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the location and _ total _ width of the resonance . a first - order perturbation treatment ( fermi s golden rule ) of the driving term yields  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the _ partial _ width for decay to the ground electronic state of the target , and",
    "@xmath64 is the initial rovibrational state of the target .",
    "the final working equation of the lcp model then reads @xmath65 the location and widths of the various resonance states were obtained from configuration interaction and fixed - nuclei variational electron scattering calculations , respectively , as detailed in paper i. in the case of the @xmath1 resonance , which generally lies below its @xmath66 neutral parent , the resonance can only decay into the ground electronic channel . in that case , the total and partial widths , @xmath9 and @xmath63 , coincide and can be obtained by fitting the eigenphase sum to a breit - wigner form . for the higher resonances ,",
    "a more elaborate fitting procedure is required to obtain the partial widths , as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite and in paper i.      a direct solution of the differential equations of the local complex potential model can pose significant difficulties for problems with multiple degrees of freedom and , in such cases , a time - dependent formulation of the problem can offer distinct computational advantages . such a formulation can be made , as demonstrated by mccurdy and turner  @xcite , by formally writing the solution of eq .",

    "since the potential surface is complex , the packet decays as a function of time until it effectively escapes the region of the surface where the width is nonzero .",

    "we may write a general expression for the six - dimensional rovibrational wave function for a triatomic with specified @xmath80 and @xmath81 value as follows : @xmath87 where the basis of @xmath88 is the set of normalized wigner rotation matrices ( and bf angular momentum eigenstates ) @xmath89 such that @xmath90 in eqs.([expansion ] ) and ( [ dnormalized ] ) we follow the conventions of zhang  @xcite , which for the @xmath91 is the same as that of edmonds  @xcite .    the standard  @xcite bf hamiltonian for the radial solutions @xmath92 of this expansion incorporates coupling among the different @xmath82 values for a given total angular momentum @xmath80 .",

    "the energy resolution is achieved by fourier transform and a final state resolution is achieved by the introduction of appropriate projection operators . for dea to a specific final rovibrational state labeled by rotational ( @xmath133 ) and vibrational ( @xmath134 ) indices , we use the projection operator @xmath135    the flux operator , which measures the flux passing through a surface defined by @xmath136 , is defined as @xmath137,\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is a heaviside function .",

    "this formulation of the flux operator is very convenient numerically and entirely equivalent to the traditional formal definition of the operator in this context , in the limit that the cap does not perturb the propagating wave packet beyond first order , which in the present case , given the nuclear masses , holds as a good approximation . for more details on this cap flux formalism",

    "as described in paper i , the gradient of the upper 2 @xmath19 resonance surface leads downhill toward its conical intersection with the 1 @xmath19 resonance , leading the propagated wave packet toward the seam .",

    "the magnitude of the cross section for production of h@xmath0+o@xmath4 from the @xmath3 resonance is therefore controlled by several competing effects .",
    "the shape of the real part of the potential - energy surface determines the dynamically accessible pathways and favors localization of the 2 @xmath19 wave packet near the conical intersection . at the same time , the large imaginary component to this surface consumes the wave packet and decreases the amount of flux available to enter the conical intersection . on the lower 1 @xmath19 surface , the amount of flux that enters the h@xmath0 potential well is determined by the shape of that potential - energy surface , since the conical intersection is outside the potential well and only a fraction of the wave packet is propagated into the well .",

    "for the major channel dea , h@xmath4+oh ( x @xmath11 ) production through the lowest @xmath1 resonance , the underlying assumptions of the model are well satisfied and we have obtained reasonably good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "another notable feature of the present study is the quantification of the mechanism in the major channel that leads to production of o@xmath4 through the @xmath3 resonance . our earlier speculation",
    "@xcite that a conical intersection between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states would play the key role in this process has been confirmed by the present study .",
    "the present treatment has been limited to a consideration of dea only into the final - state two - body channels .",
    "this limitation undoubtedly explains our inability to produce a non - zero cross section for o@xmath4 production via the @xmath2 resonance , which is likely to be dominated by three - body breakup .",
    "three - body breakup may also play a role in o@xmath4 production via the @xmath3 resonance , and its neglect here could explain why our calculated cross sections are smaller than the experimental results , which did not differentiate two- and three - body channels .",
    "physics beyond the local complex potential model may be at work in some of the minor channels .",
    "dissociative electron attachment via the @xmath2 feshbach resonance may involve an even greater variety of complicated resonant as well as non - resonant phenomena not described by the lcp model .",
    "a variety of effects that go beyond the lcp model could be at play in the production of h@xmath4 via @xmath2 feshbach resonance , including coupling to a broader shape resonance and even non - resonant virtual state effects .",
    "the neglect of such effects could well explain our overestimation of the cross section for production of h@xmath4+oh via the @xmath2 state . even for dea via the lowest - energy @xmath1 state , nonlocal physics may be important in the minor channel , which leads to h@xmath0+o@xmath4 .",
    "we have achieved considerable success in describing the mean features of dea to water , clarified the mechanisms for the two - body breakup channels , and found evidence to suggest that three - body breakup to produce o@xmath4 might be important .",
