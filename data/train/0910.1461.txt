    "stochastic processes characterized by lvy walks are relevant in many physical phenomena , ranging from condensed matter , biological systems and ecology to transport in turbulent fluids and in porous media . in recent years",
    "there has been a growing interest in the field ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "however , direct comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data in fully controlled experimental conditions is often unfeasible . as a matter of fact , evidence of anomalous transport and diffusion is often indirect and experimental setups allowing a direct and tunable study of such phenomena are hardly available .",
    "a breakthrough in the field was achieved in a recent experiment , by means of an engineered material where light rays were demonstrated to perform a lvy walk - type of diffusion @xcite .",
    "this new class of materials is built by packing glass microspheres with diameters following a lvy distribution , and then filling the space between the spheres with strongly scattering nanoparticles .",
    "as light is not scatterered within the microspheres , anomalous diffusion arises as a consequence of the power - law distribution of their diameters .",
    "the results of the experiments were indeed interpreted using a model of lvy walks @xcite for photons , and the new material was named _",
    "lvy glass_. an important feature of the experimental samples is that the walk is correlated , and the correlation is induced by the topology of the quenched medium .",
    "light that has just crossed a large glass microsphere without being scattered has a high probability of being backscattered at the subsequent step undergoing a jump of similar size .",
    "studies on models of lvy flights have evidenced that spatial correlations in jump probabilities have a deep influence on the diffusion properties @xcite . here , however , we consider lvy walk models , where particles either move ballistically or are scattered by impurities , and do not perform long range instantaneous flights . recently , one - dimensional models for lvy walks , where the correlation is induced by an underlying quenched and correlated random environment , have been studied .",
    "one - dimensional models represent simplified systems and may not compare quantitatively with real experiments .",
    "nevertheless they allow for an exact solution of the dynamics .",
    "the recent studies focused , respectively , on the mean square displacement in a lvy - lorentz gas @xcite , and on the conductivity and transmission through a chain of barriers with lvy - distributed spacings @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in simple random walks these different aspects are not independent and they can be connected by assuming standard scaling relations for the random walk probabilities @xcite , and exploiting the analogy between the associated master equation and the kirchhoff equations @xcite .",
    "when an analogous scaling holds for lvy walks , then it can be applied to relate the scaling exponents of the return probability , the mean square displacement and the effective resistance of the samples .",
    "another subtle point in random models is represented by the choice of the starting site , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it would be interesting to have a direct control on this problem .    in this paper , we will present a new class of one - dimensional models for correlated lvy walks , that will allow us to investigate in detail the scaling and the relation between transmission and mean square displacement , as well as the dependence on the starting point through average and local diffusion properties . more specifically",
    ", we will consider diffusion across deterministic fractals , namely generalized cantor and cantor - smith - volterra sets ( the latter being the simplest examples of fat fractals ) .",
    "the walker dynamics is such that it performs a standard random walk step on sites belonging to the set , while moving ballistically ( without changing direction ) otherwise . in the following",
    "we will refer to these two types of sites as `` bidirectional '' or `` unidirectional '' , respectively .",
    "lvy - type diffusion may thus arise as the longer steps will be distributed according to the voids of the cantor set , much in the same spirit of the lvy glass experiment @xcite .",
    "the model can be mapped onto a random walk on a suitable directed graph and it allows to obtain analytical results by extending the usual scaling arguments . in particular , the scaling of the resistivity with the length of the graph yields the exponents for the asymptotics of the return probability and the mean square displacement .",
    "interestingly , the system undergoes a transition from superdiffusive to diffusive behavior as a function of the density of the fractal .",
    "a similar transition has already been evidenced for lvy flights in presence of quenched noise @xcite and also in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a subtle effect of quenched disorder is the dependence of the observables on the choice of the walker starting site @xcite .",
    "an insight on this issue is clearly relevant for guiding experimental investigations . due to the simple deterministic topology",
    ", our model allows for a clear analysis of such issue . in particular",
    ", the choice of a random starting point corresponds to a measure of quantities averaged over all possible starting sites .",
    "on inhomogeneous structures , such averages can display a different asymptotic behavior @xcite with respect the corresponding local quantities , obtained by taking into account a specific starting point .",
    "this is indeed the case for generalized cantor sets : scaling relations hold for local quantities but are violated for average ones .",
    "in particular , in the local case , the random walker shifts from a superdiffusive to a diffusive motion , as a function of topological parameters tuning the void density . in the average case",
    "the behavior is even richer : a change of the void density and size induces a transition among three different regimes characterized by ballistic , superdiffusive and standard diffusive motion , respectively . in this case , which appears to be the closest to the experimental settings , adopting a method similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we give a rigorous bound on the mean square displacement and discuss the violation of scaling relations .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the topology and the dynamics of the model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exactloc ] we first review the scaling relations connecting random walk properties and the resistivity and derive the exact results for the resistivity and for the local asymptotic behavior of the walker itself .",
    "we also check , via the numerical solution of the master equation , the scaling hypothesis for local quantities . in sec  [ sec : exactav ] we turn to the average case and provide a rigorous lower bound for the exponent of the mean square displacement , as a function of the distribution of the voids .",
    "we show under which condition the bound is fulfilled exactly .",
    "also in this case we compare our analytical results with the numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the standard cantor set is built by removing the middle thirds of a linear chain and iterating the rule in every segment .",
    "the resulting set has zero measure , with fractal ( hausdorff ) dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the procedure can be easily generalized : let us denote by @xmath1 the number of parts in which we split the segment ( @xmath1 odd ) . removing parts in even positions and iterating the process , the measure of the remaining set is still zero and its fractal dimension is @xmath2 if one builds the cantor set by growing the fractal , then in this notation @xmath3 is the number of replicas of the generation @xmath4 in the generation @xmath5 .",
    "the integer @xmath6 will be used in the following to identify a given set .",
    "one can introduce the discrete version of the above procedure , as in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ cantor_walk_bubble ] , where the dark sites represent the cantor set and the grey ( fuchsia ) sites have been removed and correspond to voids .",
    "let us now introduce a random walker on such family of cantor set .",
    "the walker can reside on any site of the lattice .",
    "if it is on the void regions , it moves ballistically without changing direction : when the random walker enters a void from left ( right ) , it keeps going left ( right ) without being scattered until it reaches the opposite edge of the void itself .",
    "if instead the walker is on the sites belonging to the cantor set , it performs a standard random walk with @xmath7 probability to move right or left at the next step .     where undirectional bubbles have been introduced to describe ballistic motion in the voids .",

[ cantor_walk_bubble ] ) , then the master equation of the corresponding process reads @xmath14 the cantor structure is therefore defined by the transmission coefficients @xmath15 the above choice for @xmath16 yields indeed a ballistic motions on the voids and a random - walk behavior on the cantor set .",
    "the choice @xmath17 is readily recognized to correspond to the standard persistent random walk @xcite . in this respect",
    ", our model can also be regarded as a random walk with a site - dependent persistence ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us introduce an equivalent approach , based on graph theory .",
    "we associate to the cantor set a directed _ cantor graph _",
    ", obtained by putting undirected links in every `` solid '' segment and replacing the voids with bubbles of appropriate length whose sites are connected by directed links ( see fig .  [ cantor_walk_bubble ] for an explicit construction ) .",
    "some examples of graphs at different @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ cantor_walk_nat ] . in this framework ,",

    "the outgoing coordination number @xmath22 is one in the voids and two in the solid segments .",

    "<S> lvy - type walks with correlated jumps , induced by the topology of the medium , are studied on a class of one - dimensional deterministic graphs built from generalized cantor and smith - volterra - cantor sets . </S>",
    "<S> the particle performs a standard random walk on the sets but is also allowed to move ballistically throughout the empty regions . using scaling relations and the mapping onto the electric network problem </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the exact values of the scaling exponents for the asymptotic return probability , the resistivity and the mean square displacement as a function of the topological parameters of the sets . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the systems undergoes a transition from superdiffusive to diffusive behavior as a function of the filling of the fractal . </S>",
    "<S> the deterministic topology also allows us to discuss the importance of the choice of the initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate that local and average measurements can display different asymptotic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic results are compared with the numerical solution of the master equation of the process . </S>"
