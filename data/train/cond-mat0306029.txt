    "[ i ]    the magnetoresistance ( mr ) in a transverse field @xmath6 is one of the most frequently studied characteristics of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas @xcite . within the drude - boltzmann theory , the longitudinal resistivity of an isotropic degenerate system is @xmath6independent , _",
    "xx(b)=_0=(e^2v_f^2 ) ^-1 , [ drude ] where @xmath7 is the density of states per spin direction , @xmath8 the fermi velocity , and @xmath3 the transport scattering time .",
    "deviations from the constant @xmath9 are customarily called a positive or negative mr , depending on the sign of the deviation .",
    "there are several distinct sources of a non - trivial mr , which reflect the rich physics of the magnetotransport in 2d systems .",
    "first of all , it has been recognized recently that even within the quasiclassical theory memory effects may lead to strong mr @xcite .",
    "the essence of such effects is that a particle `` keeps memory '' about the presence ( or absence ) of a scatterer in a spatial region which it has already visited . as a result ,",
    "if the particle returns back , the new scattering event is correlated with the original one , yielding a correction to the resistivity ( [ drude ] ) .",
    "since the magnetic field enhances the return probability , the correction turns out to be @xmath6-dependent . as a prominent example ,",
    "memory effects in magnetotransport of composite fermions subject to an effective smooth random magnetic field explain a positive mr around half - filling of the lowest landau level @xcite .",
    "another type of memory effects taking place in systems with rare strong scatterers is responsible for a negative mr in disordered antidot arrays @xcite .",
    "however , such effects turn out to be of a relatively minor importance for the low ",
    "field quasiclassical magnetotransport in semiconductor heterostructures with typical experimental parameters , while at higher @xmath6 they are obscured by the development of the shubnikov - de haas oscillation ( sdho ) .",
    "second , the negative mr induced by the suppression of the quantum interference by the magnetic field is a famous manifestation of weak localization  @xcite .",
    "while the weak - localization correction to conductivity is also related to the return probability , it has ( contrary to the quasiclassical memory effects ) an intrinsically quantum character , since it is governed by quantum interference of time - reversed paths . as a result",
    "it is suppressed already by a classically negligible magnetic field , which changes relative phases of the two paths .",
    "consequently , the corresponding correction to @xmath10 in high - mobility structures is very small and restricted to the range of very weak magnetic fields .",
    "finally , another quantum correction to mr is induced by the electron  electron interaction . while this effect is similar to those discussed above in its connection with the return probability ( see sec .",
    "[ iv ] below ) , it is distinctly different in several crucial aspects .",
    "in contrast to the memory effects , this contribution is of quantum nature and is therefore strongly @xmath2-dependent at low temperatures . on the other hand , contrary to the weak localization ,",
    "the interaction correction to conductivity is not destroyed by a strong magnetic field . as a result",
    ", it induces an appreciable mr in the range of classically strong magnetic fields .",
    "this effect will be the subject of the present paper .",
    "it was discovered by altshuler and aronov @xcite that the coulomb interaction enhanced by the diffusive motion of electrons gives rise to a quantum correction to conductivity , which has in 2d the form ( we set @xmath11 ) _ xx ( 1 - 32 f ) t , t1 .",

    "the conductivity correction ( [ aadiff ] ) is then dominated by the exchange term and is negative . the condition @xmath4 under which eq .",

    "indeed , a @xmath2dependent negative mr was observed in experiments @xcite and attributed to the interaction effect .",

    "there is thus a clear need for a theory of the mr in the ballistic regime , @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , the effect of interaction on the conductivity at @xmath28 has been already considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "gold and dolgopolov @xcite analyzed the correction to conductivity arising from the @xmath2-dependent screening of the impurity potential .",
    "they obtained a linear - in-@xmath2 correction @xmath29 . in the last few years , this effect attracted a great deal of interest in a context of low - density 2d systems showing a seemingly metallic behavior  @xcite , @xmath30 .",
    "recently , zala , narozhny , and aleiner @xcite developed a systematic theory of the interaction corrections valid for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "they showed that the temperature - dependent screening of ref .",

    "the theory of refs .  , predicts , in addition to the linear - in-@xmath2 correction to conductivity @xmath31 , a @xmath16 correction to the hall coefficient  @xcite @xmath32 at @xmath33 , and describes the mr in a _ parallel _",

    "have been by and large confirmed by most recent experiments  @xcite on such systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the random potential in typical gaas heterostructures is due to remote donors and has a long  range character .",
    "thus , the impurity scattering is predominantly of a small  angle nature and is characterized by two relaxation times , the transport time @xmath3 and the single - particle ( quantum ) time @xmath23 governing damping of sdho , with @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , a description of the mr in such systems requires a more general theory valid also in the range of strong magnetic fields and for smooth disorder .",

    "we further apply it to the problem of magnetotransport in a smooth disorder at @xmath36 . in the ballistic limit , @xmath37 ( where the character of disorder is crucially important ) ,",
    "we show that while the correction to @xmath10 is exponentially suppressed for @xmath38 , a mr arises at stronger @xmath6 where it scales as @xmath39 .",
