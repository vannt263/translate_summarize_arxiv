    "development of high energy @xmath2 linear colliders is of crucial importance for the future particle physics .",
    "various r@xmath3d works are now in progress to achieve higher energy and higher luminosity .",
    "development of a high gradient rf cavity is essential to attain high energy while realization of a low emittance beam as well as a good beam monitor is important for high luminosity . at kek , the accelerator test facility ( atf ) , consisting of a 1.54 gev linac and a damping ring , has been built to study generation and manipulation of an ultra - low emittance electron beam . in accordance with this purpose",
    ", we have started developing a beam profile monitor to measure beam emittance in the ring .",
    "table [ table - drbeam ] shows the design parameters of the ring relevant to our monitor  @xcite .",
    "since the expected beam size is about @xmath4 m vertically and about @xmath5 m horizontally , a beam profile monitor with better than @xmath6 m resolution is required .",
    "a wire scanner made of tungsten or carbon is one candidate  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "however , a thin wire ( for example , @xmath7 m in diameter to achieve a desired resolution ) is expected to be destroyed due to thermal stress caused by interactions with the intense electron beam inside the ring .",
    "wire material will also influence the beam condition ; an undesirable property for the monitor .",
    "use of a laser beam , in stead of material wire , has been proposed  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "for example , a monitor using an intense pulsed laser was tested successfully and achieved a resolution in a sub - micron range  @xcite .",
    "this monitor , however , works at a repetition rate of 10hz and is not best suited to the quasi - continuous beam in the atf damping ring ; it would either take measurement time very long or necessitate a powerful laser .",
    "a new beam profile monitor is designed using a cw laser and an optical cavity .",
    "a laser beam with a very thin waist is realized by employing the cavity of nearly concentric mirror configuration while the intensity is amplified by adjusting the cavity length to a fabry - perot resonance condition .",
    "this monitor , referred to as a laser wire beam profile monitor , operates as follows .",
    "an electron interacts with laser light and emits an energetic photon into the original electron beam direction ( compton scattering ) .",
    "the counting rate of a scattered photon is observed at various wire positions ; its shape then gives a beam profile in one direction .",
    "the monitor should be able to withstand an intense electron beam without interfering it .    in this report",
    ", we describe a conceptual design of the beam profile monitor and some experimental results of a basic study with a test cavity  @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the study is to establish a method to measure the size of laser beam waist and the power enhancement factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "2 deals with a theoretical approach to the design of a new monitor . an experimental test setup and the results are shown in sec.3 .",
    "a summary and discussions are given in sec.4 .",
    ".beam parameters of the atf damping ring .",
    "the values listed in the third column are used in the counting rate calculation .",
    "note(@xmath8 ) : these values indicate the beam sizes at which this monitor will be installed .",
    "they are calculated from the designed emittance of @xmath9m@xmath10rad ( horizontal ) and @xmath11m@xmath10rad ( vertical ) with beta - functions of @xmath12 m ( horizontal ) and @xmath13 m ( vertical ) , respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table - beamwaist ]    after confirming the cavity to be in the fundamental tem@xmath14 mode , we detuned the optical axis by shifting one of the mirrors laterally to excite the transverse mode .",
    "fig.[fig - higermode ] shows a typical example of an output including higher transverse modes .",
    "we determined the spacing between the main peak ( the fundamental mode ) and its adjacent peak ( the first excitation mode ) as well as the spacing between two main peaks ( a free spectral range ) .",
    "then we deduced the cavity length @xmath15 via eq.([eq - highermode - spacing ] ) .",
    "the results of the measurements by this method are listed in the fourth column of table [ table - beamwaist ] .",
    "uncertainty came mainly from reading errors on the oscilloscope and also from non - linearity in @xmath15 .",
    "we described in this paper a conceptual design of a beam profile monitor for an electron beam with a transverse size of @xmath16@xmath17 m ( horizontal ) and @xmath16@xmath18 m ( vertical ) .",
    "specifically , the monitor is intended to diagnose an electron beam in the atf damping ring at kek .",
    "the monitor works as follows : we realize a very thin ( @xmath16@xmath18 m ) laser wire in an optical cavity .",
    "energetic photons are emitted by the compton scattering in the direction of the electron beam .",
    "the counting rate , measured as a function of the laser beam position , will give information on the electron beam profile .",
    "we calculated the scattered photon energy spectrum ( see fig.[fig - scattered ] ) and the compton cross section ( see fig.[fig - xsection ] ) for the 1.54 gev electron beam . assuming a 10 mw laser and an optical cavity with a beam waist of @xmath18 m and a power enhancement of 100 , the expected counting rate is 3.2 khz ( horizontal ) and 28.8 khz ( vertical ) when scattered photons with energies @xmath1910 mev are detected .",
    "a key element of the proposed monitor is the optical cavity , in which a gaussian beam with a @xmath18 m beam waist must be realized .",
    "a power enhancement inside the cavity is an another important parameter to investigate .",
    "we thus constructed a test cavity to measure these parameters .",
    "the cavity realized the power enhancement of 50 and the beam waist of @xmath20 m .",
    "for the beam waist measurement , we employed three independent methods .",
    "as seen in table [ table - beamwaist ] , the results obtained by these methods are consistent with each other .",
    "the relative error @xmath21 is about 5% by the shift - rotation method , less than 10% by the beam divergence measurement and less than 3% by the higher transverse mode measurement .",
    "we measured the finesse @xmath22 to obtain a power enhancement factor . using the mirrors with reflectivity of @xmath23",
    ", we obtained the enhancement of 50 ( @xmath24 ) , which is consistent with the expected value .",
    "several comments are in order here .",
    "first , we have not yet demonstrated a @xmath0 beam waist .",
    "the main defect in this test cavity is its mechanical rigidity .",
    "in particular the mirror holder ( supporting rod ) caused disturbing resonant vibration .",
    "this can , however , be overcome with a proper cavity design .",
    "the second comment is on comparison between the three methods employed to measure the beam waist .",
    "the measurement of the beam width @xmath25 is very simple and reliable . a newly devised method , the shift - rotation method , gave more accurate results than the beam divergence measurement .",
    "however , these methods would not be applicable for an actual cavity installed in an electron beam line .",
    "the third one , the observation of higher transverse modes , is simple and the most accurate among the three .",
    "thus this method is best suited to an in - situ measurement",
    ". finally , we comment on a power enhancement factor or an effective power inside the cavity .",
    "we demonstrated the enhancement factor of 50 .",
    "obviously a higher power is desirable : it would allow us faster measurement and would enable us to study , for example , an electron cooling process and/or a size of an individual bunch . in this regard , we plan to employ a laser with a higher power and mirrors with a higher reflectivity for a prototype monitor .",
    "a design work is now underway .",
