    "jean @xcite , luca and risler @xcite , li and respondek @xcite , pelletier and slayman @xcite , and others have studied models of various kinematic systems ( a car pulling @xmath0 trailers , motion of an articulated arm , @xmath0-bar systems ) .",
    "montgomery and zhitomirskii @xcite studied the relationship with curve singularities ; later , so did we @xcite . and",

    "this is related to work on the classification problem studied by mormul @xcite , montgomery and zhitomirskii @xcite , the authors @xcite , and others .    in the geometric theory of differential equations , we speculate that there may be some interesting connections between the singularity theory of the monster tower and the general monge problem for underdetermined systems of ordinary differential equations with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors derive sufficient conditions , in terms of truncated multi - flag systems , for the existence of a monge - cartan parametrization of the general solution of such systems in the regular case . to our knowledge",
    ", no connection has been made with the singular theory of multi - flags presented in this note .",
    "similar undetermined systems of ordinary differential equations are common in geometric control theory when studying flat outputs of nonlinear control systems @xcite .",
    "a detailed account of the geometry of differential equations in jet spaces can be found in @xcite , where symmetry methods from contact and symplectic geometry are used to solve non - trivial nonlinear partial and ordinary differential equations .",
    "it remains to investigate the correspondence between finite jets of spatial curves and normal forms of special multi - flags .",
    "one should explore the depth of the correspondence between arnold s a - d - e classification @xcite and the listing of normal forms of goursat multi - flags .",
    "finally , current work with algebraic geometers @xcite extends and generalizes the results of this paper to the case of an @xmath0-dimensional base .",
    "an interesting open question here concerns the existence of moduli in orbits of the action of the diffeomorphism group of the base space .",
    "thus , it is apparent that this object is of interest to a variety of pure and applied mathematicians , and that it presents a wealth of interesting problems which have potential to shed light in surprising areas .",
    "the subject begins with the study of goursat distributions , which are bracket - generating ( completely non - holonomic ) but slow growing .",
    "cartan @xcite studied the model of the canonical contact distribution on the jet space @xmath1 .",
    "all goursat distributions were believed to be equivalent to cartan s under the action of the diffeomorphism group until giaro , kumpera , and ruiz discovered the first singularity in 1978 @xcite .",
    "jean @xcite studied the kinematic model of a car pulling @xmath2 trailers , a system which is locally universal for goursat distributions of corank @xmath3 .",
    "he developed a geometric stratification given by regions in the configuration space of the model in terms of critical angles .",
    "montgomery and zhitomirskii @xcite introduced the monster tower , a sequence of manifolds with distributions in which every goursat germ occurs , allowing for jean s strata to be recast in terms of positions of members of a canonical subflag of the goursat flag .",
    "mormul @xcite labelled the strata from @xcite by words in the letters gst , which became the rvt code in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "montgomery and zhitomirskii showed that goursat germs correspond to finite jets of legendrian curve germs , and that the rvt coding corresponds to several classical invariants in the singularity theory of planar curves .",
    "they also gave complete spelling rules for the rvt code in this case .",
    "these studies were all concerned with the monster tower whose base is @xmath4 . in @xcite , we generalized this to towers with base @xmath5 .",
    "we also discovered that this object was known to algebraic geometers as the semple tower .",
    "we also began the effort to generalize the rvt code , and find spelling rules to describe which words were admissible ( theorem [ thm1 ] ) .",
    "that effort is completed here ( theorem [ thm2 ] ) .",
    "the methods used in the present contribution were first developed in @xcite , in which we also classified points in the first four levels of the tower . here",
    ", we will complete the spelling rules for base @xmath6 .",
    "our techniques generalize to towers with base @xmath5 .",
    "the diffeomorphism group of @xmath6 acts on the monster tower , and the rvt code is an invariant labeling of orbits .",
    "note that the combinatorial data in the rvt code forces a finite number of inequivalent classes at each level of the tower , but there may be moduli within a given class ( see @xcite . in @xcite , we stated the following incomplete spelling rules , which followed from @xcite .",
    "[ thm1 ] in the semple tower with base @xmath6 , every rvt code must begin with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 can not follow @xmath7 .    here , we add the missing rules , yielding the complete description of realizable rvt codes .",
    "our alphabet is the set @xmath9 .",
    "note that these seven letters correspond precisely to the seven possibilities found in semple s original work @xcite .",

    "the critical hyperplane method was implicit in parts of @xcite , made explicit in @xcite , exploited for the classification problem in @xcite , and is perfected here .",

    "we wish to understand which critical letters can be added to the end of the code ( one can always trivially add the letter @xmath7 ) . in order to do so , we must understand which critical planes lie above @xmath10 .",
    "since critical planes live within baby monsters , we must determine which baby monsters are present , and for those which are , we seek to find the levels at which they were born .",
    "we first determine the local kr - coordinate chart containing @xmath10 .",
    "we can then describe the distribution @xmath23 in coordinates .",
    "we then choose a critical plane @xmath24 , or @xmath15 , write it in coordinates as in definition [ letters ] , and trace the coordinate representations backwards , projecting down to lower levels of the tower , one at a time .",
    "if at some level @xmath25 we find that both fiber coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath27 are non - vanishing , then our critical plane must arise as the prolongation of the vertical plane @xmath28 .",
    "our critical plane therefore lives in the baby monster born at level @xmath25 , and is equal to @xmath29 .",
    "this would confirm that the critical plane we chose indeed appears in @xmath23 .",
    "if , however , we reach the base without finding such a baby monster , then the plane we chose can not exist in @xmath23 .",
    "we can shorten the procedure of tracing each plane back to the base by using previously established configuration possibilities and proceeding inductively .",
    "while this is not an algorithm in the strictest sense , it can theoretically determine which configurations are possible above any given point .",
    "as one might suspect , this can at times become extremely tedious , and would not be particularly enlightening for the reader . for this reason , we will focus the remainder of the paper on a few specific examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the method for determining spelling rules , while skipping some of the routine verification that was required to complete our results .",
    "it is obvious that the vertical plane @xmath12 appears above every point ",
    "it is just the tangent space to the fiber .",
    "so in the method just described , we need only focus on whether or not @xmath8 and @xmath15 exist ( here , since we are concerned with the @xmath6-tower  one immediately sees how this method generalizes to the @xmath5-tower ) . some of our results here ( those needed for the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] ) are summarized near the end of the paper in table [ tab : codes ] .",

    "@xmath18 , and @xmath17 can be followed by any letter .",
    "let us begin with an overview of the method of proof .",
    "the first two rules are well known and appear in @xcite and @xcite . rule ( 3 )",
    "can be checked by direct calculation ; this is tedious but straightforward and we omit the computation here .",
    "the same can be said for the part of rule ( 5 ) concerning the letter @xmath14 .",
    "the technique is illustrated by examples in @xcite and the three examples above .",
    "for example , one finds that for any point @xmath132 , the plane @xmath133 is obtained by prolonging the vertical plane from one level below . in other words , @xmath134 .",
    "similarly , the plane @xmath135 is the prolongation of the @xmath8 plane from one level below .",
    "this is independent of the code @xmath136 .    to prove the remaining rules , ( 4 ) and most of ( 5 ) , we proceed by induction on the number of letters @xmath137 , or @xmath17 appearing in the code",
    "this proof is more delicate .",
    "set @xmath138 . for the base case",
    ", we must prove that the spelling rules hold for an rvt code @xmath11 containing only one letter @xmath139 .",
    "for the inductive step , we must prove that the spelling rules hold for an arbitrary code @xmath11 , using the inductive hypothesis that the rules hold for any code containing fewer letters @xmath139 .",
    "in both steps , we assume without loss of generality that the letter @xmath140 appears at the end of the code in question",
    ".    unfortunately ( but perhaps unsurprisingly given the examples above ) , this method requires investigating a large number of specific cases , as well as a considerable number of tedious calculations .",
    "we therefore spare the reader details of all cases , and the lengthy but routine computations which are required to prove each spelling rule rigorously .",
    "instead , we will focus in detail on one particular rule : the fourth .",
    "we hope that this approach will yield sufficient detail to introduce the mechanics of the method to the reader , while sparing the reader dozens of pages of nearly identical calculations .",
    "we chose these particular cases as they exhibit generally typical behavior , but with a few of the subtleties which necessitate special care and patience .",
    "we assume rules ( 1 ) ",
    "( 3 ) have been proved . here",
    "we will provide details for rule ( 4 ) ; the remaining proofs are very similar . to this end , let @xmath11 be an rvt code of length @xmath141 , ending with the letter @xmath15 .",
    "we will show that codes @xmath142 , and @xmath143 do occur at level @xmath144 , while @xmath145 , and @xmath146 are impossible .",
    "we prove this by induction on the number of letters @xmath147 appearing in @xmath11 .",
    "we first prove the base case .",
    "assume @xmath148 , where @xmath136 does not contain any letter from @xmath149 .",
    "we will show that rule ( 4 ) holds for this @xmath11 .",
    "we prove this by considering the potential letters preceding @xmath15 . by rules ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ,",
    "@xmath15 can not be preceded by @xmath7 or @xmath12 or @xmath8 .",
    "since we have assumed that @xmath136 contains no letters from @xmath149 , we know @xmath15 can not be preceded by @xmath137 , or @xmath17 .",
    "we therefore consider the only remaining possibility : @xmath15 is preceded by @xmath14 .",
    "note that for convenience we will use @xmath136 to denote any sub - code of @xmath11 , regardless of its length .",
    "so we proceed assuming our code has the form @xmath150 , where @xmath136 contains no elements from @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the predecessor of @xmath14 can only be @xmath24 , or @xmath14 .",
    "we have three possible cases .",
    "assume our code has length @xmath141 and is of the form @xmath152 with @xmath153 .",
    "if @xmath154 , then @xmath12 precedes @xmath14 ; if @xmath155 , then @xmath8 does .",
    "the third possibility , where @xmath14 precedes @xmath14 , is treated as a separate case below .",
    "in fact , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath156 .",
    "this is valid because the plane @xmath157 is the ( possibly multi - step ) prolongation of some vertical plane from a lower level .",
    "that is , @xmath158 for some baby monster , and this subtower could not have been born at a level below the last letter @xmath12 in the rvt code .",
    "now consider @xmath156 .",
    "we have @xmath159 .",
    "we wish to show that the spelling rules hold for @xmath11 .",
    "this is to show that the codes @xmath160 are realized for @xmath161 , but are impossible for @xmath162 .",
    "now there are regular and vertical directions in each distribution plane , so it is clear that @xmath163 or @xmath12 are possible .",
    "recall from definition [ letters ] that @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to simply show that @xmath167 is possible , while @xmath168 is not .",
    "the proof here is nearly identical to that provided in example [ ex : rvl1t2 ] .",
    "in fact , that example gives precisely the case where @xmath154 . recall that in that case , @xmath8 could not appear and @xmath169 . for @xmath155",
    ", we easily verify that , again @xmath8 can not appear , and @xmath170 .",
    "the key observation is the following .",
    "the vertical plane @xmath171 is coframed by @xmath45=[a : b : 0]$ ] with @xmath122 .",
    "the prolongation of this plane is @xmath172 , which is coframed by @xmath173=[a:0:b]$ ] with @xmath68 . for @xmath155",
    ", we continue this process and find that the @xmath174th prolongation of @xmath171 is @xmath175 , which is coframed by @xmath176=[a:0:b]$ ] with @xmath68 .",
    "the rest of the steps are the same as in example [ ex : rvl1t2 ] .",
    "the method here is the same as in case 1 , so we will omit some of the readily checked details .",
    "again suppose the length of @xmath11 is @xmath141",
    ". then @xmath181 is coframed by @xmath182 $ ] , and @xmath157 would have the form @xmath182=[a : b:0]$ ] with @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",

    "finally , its projection in @xmath191 will have the form @xmath192=[0:a : b]$ ] with @xmath183 . at this point",
    ", we can see that this is the vertical plane @xmath193 , so we find that @xmath157 does indeed exist in @xmath181 , and that it is equal to @xmath194 .",
    "a computation similar to this one and those found in example [ ex : rvl1t2 ] shows that @xmath195 can not exist . in short ,",
    "one repeats this computation beginning with @xmath195 of the form @xmath182=[a:0:b]$ ] with @xmath183 , and at some point a contradiction is obtained in that some coordinate is forced to be both zero and nonzero .",
    "this establishes the base case for the proof of rule ( 4 ) by induction .",
    "we showed that rule ( 4 ) holds for any rvt code containing a single member of @xmath149 ( which , in the context of rule ( 4 ) , must naturally be the letter @xmath15 . )",
    "these three cases comprise the top three rows in table [ tab : codes ] .",
    "the remaining cases are displayed as the lower six rows in table [ tab : codes ] ; their proofs are similar .",
    "we now take @xmath11 to be an arbitrary rvt code of length @xmath141 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 ends with some letter from @xmath149 , and we will show that the spelling rules hold for @xmath11 .",
    "our inductive hypothesis states that the spelling rules hold for any code which contains fewer letters from @xmath149 than @xmath11 does .",
    "as above , we will focus on rule ( 4 ) , so our code should end with the letter @xmath15 .",
