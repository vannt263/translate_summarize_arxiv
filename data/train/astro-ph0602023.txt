    "different so called anomalies have been detected and possible explanations have been offered by several authors : ( 1 ) low value of the quadrupole , its alignment with the octopole and other multipole alignments ( de oliveira - costa et al .",

    "several works have explored the possibility of accounting for some or all of the anomalies observed in the wmap data by introducing some shear and vorticity in the universe ( jaffe et al .",
    "2005a , b , land & magueijo 2005b , mcewen et al .",
    "models introducing these anisotropic characteristics fall under the class of bianchi @xmath0 models ( barrow et al .",

    "we confirm the validity of the bianchi model obtained as a best fit to the wmap data by jaffe et al .",

    "2005 we show that the higher criticism @xmath5 statistic ( donoho @xmath6 jin 2004 ) of the bianchi corrected wmap map is compatible with gaussianity ( at the @xmath1 c.l . ) at all the wavelet scales .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the formalism in section 1 .",
    "section 2 is dedicated to introduce the analyzed data and simulations .",
    "results are presented in section 3 and they are discussed in section 4 ( conclusions also included in this section ) .",
    "as indicated above we here follow the formalism presented in cayn et al . 2005 .",
    "the statistical study is based on the @xmath5 statistic proposed in donoho & jin 2004 , jin 2004 . for a set of @xmath7 individual observations @xmath8 from a certain distribution ,",
    "@xmath5 is defined as follows .",
    "the @xmath8 observed values are first converted into @xmath9-values : @xmath10 . after sorting the @xmath9-values in ascending order @xmath11",
    ", we define the @xmath5 at each pixel @xmath12 by : @xmath13 unusually large values of @xmath14 imply deviations from gaussianity .",
    "the fact that the statistic is calculated at every pixel will allow for the location of the source of any detected deviation . in order to quantify the statistical level of any detection the maximum of the @xmath14 for a given map ( generally denoted @xmath5 )",
    "will be compared to the distribution of @xmath5 values obtained from gaussian simulations ( see discussion in the next section ) .",
    "@xmath5 has been shown to capture the unusual behavior of the few most extreme observations as well as any unusually large number of moderately high value observations .",
    "one should note that this is a completely different test to one based on the kurtosis statistic .",
    "the kurtosis enhances any deviation from gaussianity hidden in the fourth order moment and it depends on the bulk of the data .",
    "the @xmath5 of the bianchi corrected wmap data is estimated in real and in wavelet space .",
    "several groups have presented analyses of the wmap data in wavelet space ( vielva et al .",
    "2004 , cruz et al .",
    "2005 , mukherjee & wang 2004 , mcewen et al .",
    "2005a , liu & zhang 2005 , cayn et al . 2005 ) . in particular , the spherical mexican hat ( smh ) wavelet has been shown to be sensitive to the presence of non - gaussianity in the wmap data .",
    "analyses based on kurtosis and on @xmath5 show detections above the @xmath1 c.l . at a scale of five degrees .",
    "a cold spot in the southern hemisphere seems to be accounting for these detections .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study what is the effect on the @xmath5 results caused by the subtraction of a bianchi based template from the wmap data .",
    "@xmath5 is therefore calculated not only for the bianchi corrected wmap map but also for the convolution of this map with the smh wavelet at fifteen scales ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 arcmins .",
    "the first year of wmap observations is available at the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) website . for the purpose of cosmological studies the foreground cleaned intensity maps at bands q",
    ", v and w are used . a combined map ( the so called wmap data / map in this work ) is built following komatsu et al . 2003 . the weighted combination is given by , @xmath17 the temperature at pixel @xmath12 , @xmath18 results from the ratio of the weighted sum of temperatures at pixel @xmath12 at each radiometer divided by the sum of the weights of each radiometer at pixel @xmath12 .",
    "the radiometers q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 , w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 are sequentially numbered from 3 to 10 .",
    "the weights at each pixel , for each radiometer @xmath19 , are the ratio of the number of observations @xmath20 divided by the square of the receiver noise dispersion @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting map is downgraded from resolution @xmath22 to resolution @xmath23 ( the total number of pixels being @xmath24 ) .",
    "the bianchi template that is used in this work is the best fit found by jaffe et al .",
    "they considered bianchi type @xmath0 models characterized by the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the scale on which the basis vectors change orientation .",
    "the best fit was obtained for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we present here an analysis of the bianchi corrected wmap data set obtained after subtraction of this template ( and multiples of it ) from the original wmap data .",
    "the final analysis is performed on a masked version of this map that includes the so called @xmath30 mask ( released by the wmap team and available at the lambda website ) .",
    "an extension of this mask is applied to the wavelet convolved maps as discussed in vielva et al .",
    "the confidence levels of the @xmath5 statistic corresponding to the gaussian assumption are drawn from 5000 simulations were the power spectrum is the one that best fits the wmap , cbi and acbar cmb data , plus the 2df and lyman - alpha data .",
    "the simulations take also into account the beam transfer functions , the number of observations and the noise dispersion for each receiver .",
    "all these are provided by the wmap team through the lambda website .",
    "the values of the @xmath5 statistic for the wmap and the bianchi corrected wmap data are presented in figure 1 .",
    "solid , dotted - dashed and dashed lines show the @xmath31 and @xmath2 confidence levels respectively .",
    "these are obtained from the 5000 gaussian simulations described above .",
    "since the @xmath5 statistic of a map is a maximum value ( @xmath32 ) , the confidence regions are one - sided .",
    "as one can see , there is no detection of deviations from gaussianity in the bianchi corrected wmap data ( factor of @xmath33 in the figure ) .",
    "this corroborates the results obtained by jaffe et al .",
    "subtraction of the bianchi template corrects most of the anomalies that have been observed in the first year wmap data .",
    "the maps of @xmath5 values for the wmap and the bianchi corrected wmap data at a wavelet scale of 5 degrees are presented in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "as one can immediately see the detected non - gaussianity in the wmap data is dominated by the values of a ring of pixels at the spot centered at @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( note that the ring structure is likely to be caused by the convolution with the wavelet ) .",
    "subtraction of the bianchi template drops the values of the @xmath5 statistic at that spot below the @xmath2 c.l .",
    "( see figure 1 ) .",
    "however , the spot still appears as one of the most prominent regions .",
    "even if the relevance of this feature is debatable we decided to see whether different normalizations of the subtracted template can influence its amplitude .",
    "a factor of @xmath34 reduces the amplitude of the spot making it comparable with the surrounding values as can be seen in figure 4 .",
    "we have also studied whether this normalization factor affects the other anomalies observed in the wmap first year data .",
    "the effect on the alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole and the planarity as defined in oliveira - costa et al .",
    "2004 is presented in table 1 .",
    "these large scale anomalies are not very much affected by a change in the normalization factor of the bianchi template .",
    "the ratio of power between two hemispheres for a certain range of @xmath35 was calculated as in eriksen et al .",
    "the probability of having a maximum power asymmetry ratio larger than that of a given map ( either the wmap or the bianchi corrected wmap maps ) is shown in table 2 .",
    "this probability is slightly affected by the normalization factor .",
    "there is no much of a difference between the results for a factor of 1 and a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "however , above this , an increase in the normalization factor starts worsening the results .",
    "this agrees with the trend observed for the @xmath5 statistic as can be seen in figure 1 .",

    "several explanations have been discussed in the literature to account for the different anomalies observed in the first year of wmap data ( schwartz et al .",
    "2004 , vale 2005 , freeman et al .",
    "2005 , land & magueijo 2005b , jaffe et al . 2005a , b , tomita 2005 ) .",
    "these anomalies include : ( 1 ) the low value of the quadrupole , its alignment with the octopole and other multipole alignments , ( 2 ) the asymmetries observed in the distribution of large scale power , ( 3 ) the non - gaussianity detected in wavelet space which source seems to be centered at a cold spot in the southern hemisphere .",
    "however , much of this work has concentrated on explaining the anomalous low - l structure .",
    "jaffe et al , however , serendipitously discovered that at least part of the large angular scale structure of the wmap data was described by a particular bianchi viih model , and that correcting the data for this contribution provided a potential resolution for each of the above anomalies .",
    "we here confirm their results by estimating the effect of subtracting the proposed bianchi template from the wmap data , on the hc statistic . a detection of non - gaussianity localized in a cold spot at @xmath3 , @xmath4 was found by the estimation of the @xmath5 statistic of the wmap data ( cayn et al . 2005 ) .",
    "subtraction of the bianchi template renders the wmap data statistically compatible with the expected levels based on gaussian simulations .",
    "the map of @xmath5 values for the bianchi corrected wmap data ( see figure 3 ) still shows the cold spot in the southern hemisphere as one of the most prominent regions .",
    "although no special consideration should now be given to the spot on a statistical basis , it remains interesting given that the original detection of non - gaussianity was intimately associated with the region .",
    "we have determined that a modest increase in the amplitude of the bianchi template ( by a factor   1.2 ) renders the spot indistinguishable from the background level .",
    "importantly , such a change in amplitude does not perturb the effect of the template in resolving issues related to the low - l multipole features and power asymmetry .",
    "there is no compelling statistical reason , therefore , to believe that the bianchi template amplitude derived in jaffe et al should be considered underestimated .",
    "the hc results presented here , however , may be interpreted as implying that the bianchi template may require a small enhancement of power on scales corresponding to the wavelet scale of 5 degrees .",
    "one could create a bianchi template with more power on small scales by reducing the matter density , but this would also affect the large - scale structure and therefore the significance of the fit to the data . the most pragmatic interpretation of jaffe et al - that the best - fit bianchi model provides a template temperature pattern which alternative models would need to reproduce in order to resolve the observed anomalous anisotropy structure - remains valid .",
