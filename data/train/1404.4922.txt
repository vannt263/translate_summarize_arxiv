    "one of the most widespread and interesting models for studying the emergence , dynamics and interactions of coherent structures is the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite .",
    "the nlse is a paradigm for the evolution of coherent structures since it is a universal model describing the evolution of complex field envelopes in nonlinear dispersive media @xcite .",
    "this universality stems from the fact that the nlse is the prototypical , lowest - order , nonlinear partial differential equation ( pde ) that describes the dynamics of modulated envelope waves in a nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "as such , it appears in a wide variety of physical contexts , ranging from optics @xcite to fluid dynamics and plasma physics @xcite to matter waves @xcite , while it has also attracted much interest mathematically  @xcite .",
    "the general form of the nlse ( with the lowest order nonlinearity ) can be written , in non - dimensional units , as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a parameter and @xmath2 represents the strength of the nonlinear interaction and determines whether the nlse is attractive ( @xmath3 ) or repulsive ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the nlse is a model for the evolution of the mean - field wavefunction in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) at low temperatures @xcite , namely a superfluid . in the bec setting",
    ", the nlse also contains an external trapping potential term that is often spatially parabolic or periodic in nature and stems from the magnetic or optical confinement of the atoms .",
    "the nlse allows for the prediction and description of a wide range of ( nonlinear ) excitations depending on the sign of the nonlinearity and the dimensionality of the system , the latter of which that can be tuned by the ratio of trapping strengths along the different spatial directions  @xcite . in this manuscript",
    "we are interested in the fully three - dimensional regime ( 3d ) with repulsive nonlinearity ( @xmath4 ) whose basic nonlinear excitations correspond to vortex lines and vortex rings .",
    "a vortex line is the 3d extension of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) vortex by ( infinitely and homogeneously ) extending the solution into the axis perpendicular to the vortex plane .",
    "vortex lines might be rendered finite in length if the background where they live is bounded by the externally confining potential . in that case ,",
    "vortex lines become vorticity `` tubes '' that are straight across the background or bent in u and s shapes , depending on the aspect ratio of the background @xcite .",
    "if a vortex line is bent enough to close on itself , or if two vortex lines are close enough to each other , they can produce a vortex ring @xcite .",
    "vortex rings are 3d structures whose core is a closed loop with vorticity around it @xcite ( i.e. , a vortex line that loops back into itself ) .",
    "vortex rings have been observed experimentally in superfluid helium @xcite as well as in the context of becs in the decay of dark solitons in two - component becs @xcite , direct density engineering @xcite ( see also the complementary theoretical proposals of refs .  ) , and in the evolution of colliding symmetric defects @xcite .",
    "they have also been argued to be responsible for unusual experimental collisional outcomes of structures that may appear as dark solitons in cigar - shaped traps  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of experimentally feasible vortex ring generation in becs have also been explored in the context of flow past an obstacle @xcite , bloch oscillations in an optical trap @xcite , collapse of bubbles @xcite , instability of 2d rarefaction pulses @xcite , flow past a positive ion @xcite or an electron bubble @xcite , crow instability of two vortex pairs @xcite and collisions of multiple becs @xcite .",
    "vortex rings have an intrinsic velocity @xcite , which can be overcome by counteracting the velocity with a trapping potential @xcite , adding kelvin mode perturbations @xcite , or by placing the vortex ring in a co - traveling frame ( see sec .

    ", we are interested in the dynamical evolution of vortex rings and in particular in their interactions . in an effort to exclusively capture the vortex ring dynamics and not the influence of the external potential ( the latter is a natural subject for future work ) ,",
    "we assume the absence of any trapping potential and thus consider the background supporting the vortex rings as homogeneous . on this homogeneous background",
    "we revisit the intrinsic velocity of a single vortex ring that serves as the self - interacting term that will be supplemented by the interaction terms between different vortex rings .",
    "the main goal of our work is to describe vortex ring interactions and scattering collisions in a reduced ( i.e. , `` effective '' ) manner .",
    "the motivation for this approach stems from the fact that full numerical simulations in the 3d nlse can be very time consuming especially when examining scenarios involving multiple vortex rings in large domains .",
    "the first dynamical scenario that we study corresponds to the scattering of colliding vortex rings of opposite charge . using a large set of full 3d numerical simulations ( based on efficient gpu codes ,",
    "see below ) , we are able to distill a very simple , phenomenological , rule describing the scattering angle of vortex rings as a function of the vortex ring radii and the initial collisional offset . then , based on the interaction of vortex filaments from classical fluids , we revisit a reduced , ordinary differential equation , model for the interaction of co - axial vortex rings based on the biot - savart law , adapting it to the superfluid ( bec ) case . the ensuing reduced dynamics for the leapfrogging of vortex ring pairs",

    "in order to achieve accurate results for simulating the interactions of multiple vortex rings in a homogeneous background , it is necessary to first be able to generate numerically `` exact '' solutions of the individual rings . since vortex rings have an intrinsic transverse velocity due to their topological structure , standard steady - state methods ( such as imaginary time integration @xcite and nonlinear equation solvers ) for obtaining solutions of coherent structures can not be directly applied , unless the rings are in a configuration where they are at steady - state ( such as in a magnetic trap @xcite ) .",

    "we measure the average ring - pair @xmath34-velocity by tracking the @xmath34 value of the center position of a @xmath49 cut of the rings over time and then perform a least - squares linear fit .",
    "this is done for both the full nlse simulations , and for the ode integration of the reduced system . in fig .",
    "[ f : leapfrog_v ] , the results are presented as a function of @xmath12 for a few values of the initial @xmath34 separation distance , @xmath86 .",
    "we observe that the average velocity of the leapfrogging rings obtained in the pde model is always lower than that obtained in the effective ode model , the percent difference ranges between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the average velocity of two leapfrogging rings with the velocity predicted for a vortex ring of charge @xmath126 from eq .",
    "( [ vrvel ] ) . as depicted by the black thin line in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ f : leapfrog_v ] , the velocity of a vortex ring of charge @xmath126 ( evaluated at the initial radii for the leapfrogging vortex ring pair ) closely resembles the average velocity of a vortex ring pair under leapfrogging evolution .",
    "this stems from the fact that , in the far field , a vortex ring pair can be approximated by a vortex ring of charge @xmath126 .",
    "in fact , after closer inspection of the results in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ f : leapfrog_v ] , the velocity of the doubly - charged vortex ring is closer to the velocity for the vortex pairs when their separation is small , i.e. , when they are closer to each other and thus closer to a doubly - charged vortex ring . while , this relation could be further explored by taking the average radius along one leapfrogging period instead of the initial radii , the main phenomenology does not change significantly .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ f : leapfrog_v ] we show the results of measuring the period of oscillation of the leapfrogging rings from both the full nlse simulations and the ode reduced model for the same ring separations and radii .",
    "we see that the period of oscillation for the pde model is always longer than that of the ode model , and the percent difference in period ranges from @xmath130 to @xmath131 percent , which , while clearly worse than the velocity comparison , is not unreasonable .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the period of the leapfrogging rings changes depending on the @xmath34-distance between the rings , it remains fairly constant for vortex ring pairs of _ different _ radii at the same separation distance .    from the velocity and period results , we see that there are obviously some differences between the quantum and classical fluid regimes including the modified values that result in lower average pair velocities and longer periods of oscillation than those predicted by our current reduced equations of motion .",
    "these are worthy of further investigation , in order to improve the accuracy of the reduced equations of motion .",
    "nevertheless , the trends of the two sets of results are very similar , and their magnitudes are comparable , which suggests that our effective description provides a valuable means of examining the numerical ( and , presumably , also the experimental ) data and , as such , is useful in its own right as well as worthy of further investigation .    finally , it is worth pointing out that there has been recent efforts in describing the leapfrogging dynamics of vortex ring bundles in classical fluids using the vortex filament method  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is found that the leapfrogging dynamics is weakly unstable for small number of vortex rings . in our numerics",
    "we have found similar instabilities , that depending on the separation and radii of the vortex rings , may not be visible until tens of leapfrogging periods .",
    "therefore , although weakly unstable , the time required for the instability to manifest itself might be long enough to be able to observe leapfrogging during the typical lifetime of current bec experiments .",
    "it is also important to mention that the 2d equivalent of leapfrogging has been studied in the case of point vortices @xcite .",
    "this 2d leapfrogging corresponds to two vortex dipoles ( vortex and anti - vortex pairs ) and it is found to display three distinct regions depending on the distance between pairs ( relative to the internal distance between vortices in each pair ) as follows .",
    "( a ) the small separation region does not yield leapfrogging .",
    "( b ) intermediate separations yield _ unstable _ leapfrogging .",
    "( c ) large separation distances yield _ stable _ leapfrogging .",
    "the 2d vortex dipole leapfrogging is strongly connected to 3d vortex ring leapfrogging since any 2d cut passing through the axes of the vortex rings will produce a 2d pair of vortex dipoles . therefore , 2d vortex dipole dynamics is the basic ingredient responsible for vortex ring leapfrogging .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to test if the vortex ring leapfrogging also displays the three regions described above and whether the weak instability that we have observed can in fact be eliminated by using larger vortex ring radii . this avenue of research is currently being examined and a systematic investigation will be reported in a future publication .",
    "we studied the dynamics and interactions of vortex rings in the nonlinear schrdinger equation as a model for a homogeneous bose - einstein condensate . upon corroborating the well - known single vortex ring evolution in our 3d nlse framework , we focused on two dynamical scenarios : scattering and leapfrogging . for the former , we considered the scattering collision of two co - planar , opposite charge , vortex rings . upon their collision , these scatter at an angle depending on the initial conditions .",
    "we found a surprisingly simple phenomenological rule for the scattering angle as a function of the vortex ring radii and the initial distance ( impact parameter ) between the vortex rings .",
    "for the second scenario , we followed the dynamics of a pair of co - axial vortex rings of the same charge .",
    "we proposed a modification of the effective equations of motion for the vortex ring interactions in a classical superfluid .",
    "the modification was based on correcting the self - induced velocity using previous results for nlse settings in a quantum superfluid .",
    "we compared the resulting effective equations of motion against full 3d simulations of the original nlse model for several cases of leapfrogging evolution and found good agreement between the two .",
    "finally , we found a monotonic decrease for the average velocity of the leapfrogging as the radii of the ring increase and/or as their initial separation increases .",
    "we also found that the leapfrogging period remains approximately constant for vortex ring pairs of different radii starting at the same separation distance , while the period increases with initial separation distance for fixed radii .",
    "future work will be directed towards refining the reduced equations of motion to better account for the differences between classical and quantum fluids ( especially in the context of the term encoding the interaction between the different rings ) , and expanding them to describe more general configurations of vortex rings , as opposed to only those which are co - axial .",
    "it would also be interesting to understand and quantify the instability ( and its range of relevance over initial conditions and system parameters ) observed in the leapfrogging dynamics , not only for a pair of vortex rings but also , for vortex ring bundles  @xcite .",
    "another avenue for future exploration consists of using classical fluid - inspired effective equations of motion ( biot - savart law ) to obtain reduced odes describing the effects of slow - down created by internal excitation ( kelvin ) modes  @xcite and , in more general terms , the effects of these modes on the interactions and scattering between vortex rings .",
    "we are currently exploring these directions and will report on them in future works .",
