    "a simple case in question is a cavity filled with an ultracold gas of bosons and subject to a transverse drive due to the coherent field of a pump laser . as predicted by domokos and ritsch  @xcite , the backaction of the atoms on the light in the presence of a transverse driving can lead to the formation of a spontaneous density modulation of the atoms .",
    "the lattice spacing of the resulting crystalline order is set by the cavity mode wavelength , thus optimizing the bragg scattering of the laser photons into the cavity mode .",
    "simultaneously , the cavity mode itself acquires a finite expectation value which leads to a change of the spectum of polaritons in the cavity .",
    "this transition to a spatially ordered state of atoms in a cavity has been observed experimentally first with thermal atoms  @xcite and - more recently - with a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite .",

    "a self - ordered , periodic arrangement of the atoms in a transversely driven cavity assumes that the atomic wave vectors can be truncated to just two , namely @xmath0 and the cavity mode wave vector @xmath1 .",
    "within such a two - mode approximation , the problem is reduced to an effective dicke model  @xcite where a large spin of length @xmath2 is linearly coupled to the quadrature @xmath3 of the cavity field .",
    "surprisingly , to date @xcite , it has remained unclear how the simplified description within a generalized dicke model or the semiclassical treatment of the atomic field @xcite is connected to the actual many - body situation in which the bose gas can either be bose - condensed or in a thermal state at higher temperatures .",
    "in particular , a study of whether and how the properties of the self - organization transition change between the bec limit studied in the eth experiments  @xcite and the earlier ones in a thermal gas at mit  @xcite has been lacking .",

    "apart from the quite different symmetry breakings involved ( as we discuss in more detail below ) , the dhl and bec transitions are fundamentally distinct also in the sense that the former is caused by an external driving in an open system while the transition to a bec is due to the standard competition between energy and entropy in an equilibrium situation . despite these differences",

    "[ threshold_plot ] .",
    "as anticipated in the beginning of this section , the existence of a minimum for @xmath167 is an effect of thermal occupation of the momentum continuum and is due to the fact that , over a certain range of temperature , @xmath144 grows with @xmath59 .",
    "let us consider the lindhard function as written on the second line of ( [ lindhard ] ) and put @xmath193 .",
    "for the present argument , the relevant contribution to the momentum integral is coming from momenta such that the denominator is zero . there is no singularity since the numerator is also zero , yielding a finite value .",

    "this happens every time that the scattering takes place in the configuration illustrated in fig .",

    "the only condition to be fulfilled in order for the atom not to change its energy in the scattering is that its momentum component along the cavity direction is equal to half of the photon momentum : @xmath194 .",

    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ threshold_plot ] , when @xmath59 becomes comparable or larger than @xmath195 , the temperature starts to disfavor the self - organization .",
    "this is due to the occupation of larger momenta along the cavity direction which subtracts weight from the @xmath196 region .",
    "we thus understand the minimum in @xmath167 as resulting from the competition between the smearing out of the occupation of the @xmath197 momentum state along the cavity direction and the occupation of the continuum of momentum states transverse to the cavity direction .",

    "this is due to the fact that the peak broadening , proportional to the imaginary part of the self energy , behaves like @xmath208 at small frequency .",
    "this implies that the polaritons are not well defined quasiparticles for @xmath252 .",
    "further insight into this aspect is provided by analyzing the behavior of the poles of the propagator @xmath253 .",
    "these are determined by the equation : @xmath254 .",
    "the result for the soft mode pole is : @xmath255 far enough from the transition , the term under the square root is positive therefore the pole has both an imaginary part , related to the broadening factor @xmath251 , and a real part .",
    "however , close enough to the transition , the term in the square root must become negative , thereby making the soft mode pole purely imaginary @xmath256 this means that the soft mode becomes overdamped close to the transition with the position of the pole vanishing linearly with @xmath257 along the imaginary axis .",
    "this behavior is the same , but the origin of the effect different , as observed in @xcite in a calculation of the two - state dicke model with photon decay . in that reference , the broadening and overdamping of the polariton excitations is due to coupling of photons to the bath of electromagnetic modes outside the cavity . in the present paper ,",
    "the polaritons become dissipative from coupling to the thermal bath of bosonic atoms .",
    "the behavior of the spectral function close to the transition determines the photon flux exponent @xcite characterizing the divergence of the average photon density at the critical point .",
    "indeed , at thermal equilibrium the following relation holds @xcite : @xmath258 .",
    "since the divergence comes from the small frequency part of the integral , we can approximate @xmath259 and perform the integral in an interval around @xmath238 using the expression , to get : @xmath260 which gives a photon flux exponent equal to one , typical of a thermal behavior . the same exponent was also found in @xcite , where the thermal character of the steady state was again to `` thermal '' noise from cavity decay .",
    "the result is valid at any finite temperature . at @xmath4 instead , since @xmath261 , we have @xmath262 as expected @xcite .",
    "in this section , we study the scaling of the fluctuations in the tl and show that the self - organization transition is of the mf type . indeed , as we will show below",
    ", the corrections to the mf solution in the self - organized phase vanish in the tl , and in the homogeneous phase the gaussian theory for the fluctuations about the cavity vacuum , corresponding to the action ( [ s_eff_2 ] ) , becomes exact .",
    "moreover , we will show that there is no quantum depletion of the atomic condensate in absence of additional short - range interactions between the atoms .    up to now",
    ", we have truncated our expansion of the action ( [ s_eff ] ) around the cavity mf at the second order in the cavity fluctuations to obtain the action ( [ s_eff_2 ] )",
    ". however , higher order terms , corresponding to interactions between the cavity photons mediated by the atoms , can in principle be relevant .",
    "for instance , in the framework of an effective ginzburg - landau theory for the cavity field , the higher order terms are needed to determine the nature of our self - ordering transition . in this section",
    ", we will study the full effective action ( [ s_eff ] ) in the tl , where some exact statements can be made .",
    "let us consider the scaling in the tl of the diagrams appearing in our theory .",
    "for instance , consider a typical self - energy diagram , like the one in fig .",
    "[ self_en_all ] . since for each photonic leg",
    "we have a vertex scaling like @xmath263 , such a diagram scales like unity for the fluctuations @xmath264 and like @xmath5 for the mf ( when the external photonic legs are proportional to @xmath125 ) .",
    "indeed , there is no external loop thus no scaling from the external legs , apart from the mf diagrams .",
    "the same reasoning can be applied to a typical interaction ( @xmath265-th order ) term , like the one in fig .",
    "[ diag_interaction ] . in this case",
    ", the addition of two external legs brings a further @xmath266 scaling due to the vertices , but no further scaling due to the external lines , apart again from the mf diagrams .",
    "therefore , a typical @xmath265-th order diagram scales like @xmath266 for the fluctuations and like @xmath5 for the mf .",
    "these scaling arguments have several important implications : first , the mf diagrams contribute to all orders in the cavity field , i.e. the action ( [ s_mf ] ) can not be truncated at some power of @xmath126 . moreover , the fluctuation diagrams , at most of order one , are negligible with respect to the mf diagrams @xmath267 .",
    "therefore , the mf approach discussed in section [ mf ] becomes exact in the tl .",
    "this is the same as it happens for the restricted bcs model @xcite where the coupling between fermions takes place only at fixed exchanged momentum equal to zero .",
    "we will come again to this analogy at the end of this section . in all our calculations",
    ", we found that our mf approach predicts a continuous self - organization transition .",
    "clearly , outside the self - organized phase the mf @xmath124 and we are left with the fluctuation diagrams only .",
    "yet , we are allowed to retain only the self - energy diagrams of fig .",
    "[ self_en_all ] and neglect all the interaction diagrams which scale like @xmath266 .",
    "this means that the action ( [ s_eff_2 ] ) becomes exact in the tl and we have a free gaussian theory .",
    "this in turn implies that the cavity propagator ( [ prop_cav ] ) becomes exact in the tl .",
    "-th order feynman diagram describing the atom - mediated interaction between cavity photons .",
    "the notation is the same as in fig .",
    "[ self_en_all ] . ]",
    "a further relevant implication of the above scaling arguments is that the fluctuations originating from the cavity do not deplete the atomic condensate in the tl .",
    "this is due again to the fact the these fluctuations are of order unity and are thus negligible with respect to the number of atoms @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , since the cavity fluctuations are the only quantum fluctuations ( surviving even at @xmath4 ) , we conclude that there is no quantum depletion of the atomic condensate in the tl .",
    "we point out that the scaling arguments also apply if one includes short - range interactions between the atoms . more precisely",
    ", the fact that the mean - field is exact in the tl still holds , even though the model is not exactly solvable anymore .",
    "the underlying reason for these scalings is the fact that the cavity photons have only one fixed momentum .",
    "that is , we have one single degree of freedom @xmath98 in zero dimensions . in this sense ,",
    "the self - organization transition is to be regarded as a quantum bifurcation rather than a quantum phase transition .",
    "indeed , there is no divergent length scale and no quantum critical behavior , like it happens in the standard dicke model .",
    "the exactness of mf theory for the present problem can be understood from a different point of view by considering the effective interaction between atoms which is mediated by the cavity photons .",
    "this interaction is obtained from the full action ( [ s_prime ] ) by integrating out the cavity field @xmath218 .",
    "since the latter only appears quadratically , this is a gaussian integration which can formally be done at the expense of introducing terms beyond quadratic order in the ground state atomic field @xmath268 .",
    "expanding the resulting action up to fourth order in @xmath268 , one obtains a standard density - density interaction between the atoms of the form @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the atom density .",
    "the interaction is retarded on a scale which is set by the real part of the photon propagator @xmath271}{\\sinh\\left[-\\delta_{\\rm c}\\beta/2\\right]}\\ , .\\ ] ] in the limit of a large and negative detuning @xmath272 , @xmath273 this retardation is negligible , however , because @xmath274 .",
    "we recall that to arrive at eq .",
    "( [ long_range_int ] ) , we also took the detuning atom - pump detuning @xmath18 , typically in the ghz regime , to be much larger than the recoil energy and the atomic chemical potential , typically in the khz regime .",
    "in that regime , we can also safely discard potential retardation effects arising from propagation of the intermediate excited state in the 2-photon processes described earlier in fig .",
    "[ effective_vertices ] .",
    "the effective interaction hamiltonian which is associated with the action ( [ long_range_int ] ) can be written in the form @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the fourier transform of the atom density at wave vectors @xmath100 .",
    "remarkably , the above interaction term eq .  ( [ long_range_int ] ) is of the same form than the interaction term in the reduced bcs model of attractively interacting fermions upon replacing @xmath277 with @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is the total number of zero momentum fermion bilinears . in a classic paper @xcite",
    ", mhlschlegel has shown that such reduced models are solved exactly within mean - field theory ( see also ref . ) .",
    "diagrammatically , this means that the exact free energy density consists of all connected `` bubble '' diagrams in each of which the prefactor @xmath266 cancels with the loop integration over all degrees of freedom .",
    "higher - order corrections from inserting additional vertices and closing external legs ( for example of the type shown in fig .  [ diag_interaction ] ) , will generate additional vertices each scaling as 1/n . because the momentum - transfer at each vertex is restricted to exactly equal @xmath280 here , or zero in the bcs model ,",
    "these vanish .",
    "note that for the dhl self - organization transition , the order parameter is a real - valued density wave ( dual to the coherent cavity field appearing in eq .",
    "( [ s_mf ] ) ) , whereas in the bcs model the order parameter is in general a complex - valued cooper pairing amplitude .",
    "condensation of cooper pairs breaks a @xmath36 symmetry because the operator @xmath281 may have an arbitrary phase , while in our case @xmath282 is real and the only remaining degeneracy is the discrete parity , which corresponds to ordering in @xmath283 or @xmath284 , a @xmath30 symmetry ( see ref .   for an explanation of an analogous @xmath30-type mean - field model for commensurate charge ordering of fermions in a half - filled hypercubic lattice ) .",
    "this paper provided an exact solution of the interplay of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and the dicke - hepp - lieb ( dhl ) self - organization transition of a bose gas at arbitrary temperatures subject to a dynamical optical potential generated by the electromagnetic vacuum field of a high - quality optical resonator .",
    "we showed that , at finite temperatures , the typically invoked hilbert space truncation to only two atomic momentum states , that leads to a description in terms of a zero - dimensional effective dicke model , becomes unphysical and breaks down .",
    "we developed an effective action approach that captures the dynamical multi - band structure , that the cavity generates for the atoms , as well as the backaction of the atoms on the cavity spectrum . using this approach , we computed the full phase diagram at arbitrary temperature and discovered a bi - critical point , at which the atoms become superfluid and self - organize at the same time .",
    "we showed that the thermally excitable continuum of atomic finite momentum states can enhance self - organization in striking contrast to the finite - temperature solution of the dicke model where a finite temperature always counteracts ferromagnetic spin order .",
    "moreover , the thermal bath of atoms strongly broadens and overdamps the polaritonic sidebands of the cavity spectrum .",
    "we also gained some structural insights and argued that the cavity - bose gas problem , in the absence of short - range interactions between the atoms , belongs to a class of exactly solvable , so called restricted , mean - field models , the most prominent of which is the celebrated bcs - theory of superconductivity .",
    "it is remarkable that many - body cavity qed provides a natural , experimental incarnation of such models .",
    "we note that also the experimentally relevant non - equilibrium extensions of the model of this paper , that is , coupling the photons and atoms to markovian baths , will remain exactly solvable as long as potential loss and gain terms are operative on the single - particle level .",
    "our calculations were carried out in a frame rotating with the optical frequency of the driving laser . in that frame",
    ", the periodically driven bose gas in a cavity can be formulated as a time - independent hamiltonian problem .",
    "we here employed a equilibrium path integral formalism without explicitly accounting for the finite photon lifetimes and spontaneous emission of the atoms .",
    "this means we have implicitly assumed a dissipative loss channel for the energy deposited by the drive laser without accounting for the usually arising noise terms ( from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) .",
    "this approach is not rigorous but has been shown to work well for the unitary ( reversible ) sector of the non - equilibrium steady states for dicke - type models in cavity qed ( see e.g. ref .   for detailed comparison between the equilibrium and non - equilibrium steady states ) .",
    "in particular the phase diagram and basic features of the spectral properties only receive relatively small , quantitative modifications from the dissipation .",
    "the fact that the markovian baths typical of quantum optics generate a finite , effective temperature at long times further supports the usage of an equilibrium formalism . in the present context , the main aspect that the equilibrium formalism misses are ( additional ) imaginary contributions to the poles of correlation functions which should lead to irreversible , overdamped dynamics especially close to the self - organization transition . the equilibrium formalism also is not able to differentiate between the transient regimes at shorter times , which should be the most relevant for a refined comparison with experiments , and the asymptotic long - time regimes , which have so far been the focus of most of the theoretical works .    in the future",
    ", it will be interesting to generalize the results obtained in the present paper to lossy cavities and clarify further the dissipative effects induced by a finite temperature versus those induced by cavity decay .",
    "it should also be possible to consider interacting bose gases in a cavity and study the competition of cavity - mediated interaction , short - range repulsion , and dissipation in the superfluid regime .",
