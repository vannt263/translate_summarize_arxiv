    "the lack of additional computational expense is a huge advantage of the recka over others methods that evaluate ehrenfest potentials accurately ; these methods demand the derivative calculation of the excited - state pes , which is a computationally - demanding task that limits such approaches to small systems  @xcite .",

    "the second condition suggests that the response becomes small for large systems irrespective of the magnitude of the reorganization energy .",

    "they show a slight deviation for the fast relaxation time of 5.3 fs . comparing the ka and recka models , we have found that the effects of reorganization corrections are negligible for slow and intermediate bath relaxation times .",
    "however , the relaxation included in the recka approach for fast relaxation times yields results that are nearly identical to those of the benchmark heom approach .",

    "ka and recka still agree well with heom for slow and intermediate bath relaxation times .",
    "however , they deteriorate for the faster relaxation time : ka predicts a much faster time scale for inter - site energy transfer . owing to the lack of reorganization effects , the ka approach provides the same energy - level distributions for absorption and fluorescence , which results in larger estimated hopping rates .",

    "<S> environmentally induced fluctuations of the optical gap play a crucial role in electronic energy transfer dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> one of the simplest approaches to incorporate such fluctuations in energy transfer dynamics is the well known haken - strobl - reineker ( hsr ) model , in which the energy - gap fluctuation is approximated as white noise . </S>",
    "<S> recently , several groups have employed molecular dynamics simulations and excited - state calculations in conjunction to account for excitation energies thermal fluctuations . on the other hand , since the original work of hsr , many groups have employed stochastic models to simulate the same transfer dynamics . here , we discuss a rigorous connection between the stochastic and the atomistic bath models . if the phonon bath is treated classically , time evolution of the exciton - phonon system can be described by ehrenfest dynamics . to establish the relationship between the stochastic and atomistic bath models , we employ a projection operator technique to derive the generalized langevin equations for the energy - gap fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic bath model can be obtained as an approximation of the atomistic ehrenfest equations via the generalized langevin approach . </S>",
    "<S> based on this connection , we propose a novel scheme to take account of reorganization effects within the framework of stochastic models . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme provides a better description of the population dynamics especially in the regime of strong exciton - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the effect of the bath reorganization in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of ideal j - aggregates in terms of the stokes shifts . </S>",
    "<S> we find a simple expression that relates the reorganization contribution to the stokes shifts  the reorganization shift  to the ideal or non - ideal exciton delocalization in a j - aggregate . </S>",
    "<S> the reorganization shift can be described by three parameters : the monomer reorganization energy , the relaxation time of the optical gap , and the exciton delocalization length . </S>",
    "<S> this simple relationship allows one to understand the physical origin of the stokes shifts in molecular aggregates . </S>"
