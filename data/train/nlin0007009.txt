    "these solutions generate bosonic and fermionic flows of the @xmath1 supersymmetric toda lattice hierarchy in the same way as their bosonic counterparts  the solutions of the symmetry equation of the darboux transformation @xcite  produce the flows of the bosonic toda lattice hierarchy .",

    "we present a short summary of the main facts concerning the @xmath0 toda lattice hierarchy and its bosonic and fermionic flows which are used in what follows . in section 3",
    "we formulate a _ conjecture _ concerning the @xmath0 superfield formulation of the @xmath0 toda lattice hierarchy .",
    "our conjecture is partly proven in section  4 and gains further support in section 5 by a set of arguments , including explicit calculations of the first three flows . in section  6",

    "in this section we briefly review the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite ( for more detail , see @xcite and references therein ) for constructing an infinite class of bosonic and fermionic flows of the @xmath0 toda lattice hierarchy in @xmath1 superspace .    the starting point is the @xmath1 supersymmetric generalization of the darboux transformation @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are bosonic @xmath1 superfields defined on the lattice , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the @xmath9 supersymmetric fermionic covariant derivatives @xmath10 the composite superfield @xmath11 satisfies the @xmath1 supersymmetric toda lattice equation @xmath12 for this reason , the hierarchy of equations invariant under the darboux transformation  ( [ toda1 ] ) is called the @xmath1 supersymmetric toda lattice hierarchy .",
    "one of the possible ways of constructing invariant equations is to solve the corresponding symmetry equation . in the case under consideration",

    ", this system is invariant under the discrete transformation ( [ toda1 ] ) and , therefore , belongs to the hierarchy as defined above . in other words , different solutions of the evolution system  ( [ evol ] ) ( which , actually , are given by pairs of superfields @xmath23 with different values for @xmath20 ) are related by the discrete darboux transformation ( [ toda1 ] )",
    "altogether , invariant evolution systems form a _ differential _ hierarchy , i.e. a hierarchy of equations involving only superfields at a single lattice point . in contrast , the discrete lattice shift ( the darboux transformation ) , when added to the differential hierarchy , generates the _ discrete _ @xmath1 supersymmetric toda lattice hierarchy .",
    "thus , the discrete hierarchy appears as a collection of an infinite number of isomorphic differential hierarchies  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry equation ( [ sym ] ) represents a complicated nonlinear functional equation , and its general solution is not known . for a more complete understanding of the hierarchy structure and its solutions it seems advantageous to know as many solutions of eq .",

    "@xcite addressed this problem and derived a wide class of bosonic as well as fermionic solutions .",

    "one can easily see that fermionic covariant derivatives commute with the shifts by _ even _ number of lattice points only .",
    "therefore , the chirality constraints ( [ n=4constr ] ) are invariant with respect to shifts by only an _ even _ number of lattice points , which is the reason why only superfields @xmath114 at _ even _ lattice points enter the equations  ( [ toda11r ] ) . in spite of this peculiarity the numbers of independent dynamical degrees of freedom entering the @xmath1 equations  ( [ toda11 ] ) and the @xmath0 equations  ( [ toda11r ] ) are the same , and they are in one - to - one correspondence .",

    "( [ ffff2 ] ) only in the particular combination occuring on the left hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ identities ] ) and thus disappear .",
    "so , one might say that @xmath145 and @xmath135 owe their chirality properties ( [ constralpha1 ] ) to the projector @xmath143 in eq .",

    "one can straightforwardly verify that the eqs .",

    "comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ ffff2 ] ) and eqs .",

    "( [ fff1 ] ) but flips the chirality of the remaining @xmath148 factors .",
    "moreover , one can easily see from its definition  ( [ eqq2 ] ) that @xmath146 always preserves the chirality of the first term in a product .",
    "therefore , the chirality properties of the functionals @xmath149 are identical to those of @xmath150 .",
    "furthermore , it is obvious by induction that the same arguments can be applied to each functional from the set  ( [ functionals ] ) since they are recursively related by the operator @xmath146 .",
