    "low - dimensional quantum systems are a formidable arena for the study of many - body physics : in one or two spatial dimensions ( 1d or 2d ) , the effects of strong correlations and interactions are enhanced and lead to dramatic effects . celebrated examples from condensed matter physics include such diverse cases as the fractionalization of charge and emergence of topological order in the quantum hall effect , high-@xmath0 superconductivity , or the breakdown of landau s fermi liquid theory in 1d , replaced by the luttinger liquid paradigm @xcite . in the past decade , breakthroughs in the field of",
    "optically trapped ultra - cold atomic gases @xcite have lead to a new generation of quantum experiments that allow to directly observe fundamental phenomena such as quantum phase transitions @xcite and coherent quantum dynamics @xcite in low - dimensional systems , including 1d gases @xcite .",
    "these revolutionary experiments are an ideal playground for the interplay with theory , as they allow to directly realize , in the laboratory , ideal setups that were previously regarded only as oversimplified thought experiments .    on the theory side",
    ", many exact results in 1d can be obtained by a blend of methods that comprises lattice integrability @xcite and non - perturbative field theory approaches , in particular 2d ( 1 + 1d ) conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite and integrable field theory @xcite .",
    "cft has been incredibly successful at making exact universal predictions for 1d condensed matter systems at a quantum critical point ; these include the kondo effect and other quantum impurity problems @xcite , and the many insights on quantum quenches @xcite as well as universal characterization of entanglement at quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "entanglement entropies , in particular , are currently in the limelight , as they have become experimentally measurable both in- @xcite and out - of - equilibrium @xcite , opening the route to a direct comparison between experimental data and many exact analytical results obtained by cft .",
    "indeed , entanglement entropies are usually difficult to compute in microscopic models @xcite , but their scaling limit is obtained within the powerful cft approach by solving elementary exercises on riemann surfaces @xcite .    there is a caveat in the cft approach to 1d physics though : since it describes low - energy excitations around some fixed energy scale ( _ e.g. _ the fermi energy ) , cft does not accommodate strong variations of that scale throughout the system .",
    "this rules out _ a priori _ the possibility of tackling _ inhomogeneous _",
    "systems , in which the relevant energy scale varies .",
    "this caveat is important , as inhomogeneous systems are the rule rather than the exception in the realm of quantum experiments : quantum gases at equilibrium always lie in trapping potentials ( often harmonic ) and therefore usually come with a non - uniform density ; this is also the case of many out - of - equilibrium situations , such as trap releases .    in this paper , we make one step forward .",
    "we focus on the example of the free fermi gas , in a few illustrative in- and out - of - equilibrium inhomogeneous situations .",
    "the free fermi gas is technically simpler than interacting models , and yet it allows to draw interesting lessons that will hold more generally .",
    "we find that the varying energy scale is taken into account rather naturally in the effective field theory , in the form of varying parameters in the action .",
    "interestingly , the _ metric _ is one such parameter , so one generically ends up with a cft in curved 2d space .",
    "these conclusions are very general and hold under the reasonable assumption of separation of scales : there must exist an intermediate scale @xmath1 which is simultaneously large compared to the microscopic scale ( the inter - particle distance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the density ) , but small compared to the scale on which physical quantities vary macroscopically ( of order @xmath4 ) . indeed , at the intermediate scale @xmath1 , the system is well described by continuous fields because @xmath5 , and is locally homogeneous because @xmath6 , so one knows that it corresponds to a standard ( i.e. flat - space , translation - invariant ) field theory .",
    "from there , it is clear that unravelling the global theory for the _ inhomogeneous _ system is a problem of geometric nature : it is about understanding the global geometric data ( _ e.g. _ metric tensor , coupling constants , gauge fields , _ etc .",
    "_ ) that enter the action .",
    "this is the program we illustrate with the few simple examples below .",
    "we demonstrate the power of this formalism by providing new exact asymptotic formulas for entanglement entropies .",

    "here we do not keep track of these phase factors , as they are unimportant for our purposes , and simply discard them ; these aspects are discussed in appendix  [ app:1 ] .    from wick s theorem",
    ", it then follows that the large - scale behavior of arbitrary multi - point correlations of the original fermions can be obtained from correlators in the massless dirac theory .",

    "we ask : _ what is the underlying dirac action _ ?",
    "the system is now _ inhomogeneous _ , so there should be parameters in the effective action that vary with position .",
    "but _ what are these parameters _ in ( [ eq : dirac_flat ] ) ? in order to understand this , one needs to find the density profile first .",
    "the latter is obtained from the exact solution of the microscopic problem in the thermodynamic limit , which in this case is extremely simple .",
    "the single - particle eigenstates are just those of the harmonic oscillator , and the many - body ground state is obtained by simply filling up all eigenstates with negative energies . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath28 ) , the density profile follows the wigner semicircle law @xmath29 which is non - vanishing in the interval @xmath30 $ ] with @xmath31 . here and in the following , we set @xmath32 .",

    "but the real question is : _ is there a consistent dirac theory defined globally on the entire domain @xmath48 \\times \\mathbb{r}$ ] , such that its propagator has the required local behavior everywhere _ ?",
    "if the reader is familiar with quantum field theories in curved background , they will probably have guessed that eq .",

    "the underlying riemannian metric is @xmath51 to connect this theory to eq .",
    "( [ eq : prop_local_harm ] ) , notice that , in the coordinate @xmath25 , the propagator behaves locally as @xmath52 thus , to prove that eq .",
    "( [ eq : prop_local_harm ] ) is the propagator of a dirac fermion in a curved metric , it is sufficient to exhibit a map @xmath53 such that @xmath54 for some real - valued function @xmath55 .",
    "this equation can be solved easily .",
    "first , notice that it is equivalent to @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "writing that @xmath58 , we find a constraint on @xmath59 : @xmath60 . looking for a solution that is independent of @xmath10 , we can set @xmath61 , which implies @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the solution is straightforward : up to an additive constant , we find the complex coordinate system @xmath64 , which lives on the infinite strip @xmath65 \\times \\mathbb{r}$ ] : @xmath66 this fixes the underlying geometry of the problem .",
    "to illustrate the power of this approach , we exhibit new exact results for the entanglement entropies of the fermi gas in external trapping potentials .",
    "such calculations are , in general , difficult . but within the framework we just developed , they boil down to elementary manipulations of complex analytic functions .",
    "the renyi entanglement entropies of a subsystem @xmath67 are defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath67 and @xmath70 is an arbitrary real number . for @xmath71",
    ", @xmath72 reduces to the von neumann entropy of the subsystem which is usually referred to as entanglement entropy .",
    "the main property we will use in the following is that the renyi entanglement entropies are related to the expectation values of the twist fields @xmath73 @xcite which under conformal mapping share the same transformation properties of primaries with dimension @xmath74 with @xmath75 the central charge of the cft ( @xmath76 for the free fermi gas ) .",
    "let us now apply eqs .",
    "( [ eq : metric])-([eq : coordinates_harm ] ) to the problem of calculating the entanglement entropy in a harmonic trap .",

    "the renyi entanglement entropy is @xcite @xmath80 @xmath81 is a uv cutoff , sometimes dismissed in homogeneous systems , because it simply appears in the form of a non - universal constant offset . in _",
    "inhomogeneous _ situations , however , it is crucial to have a closer look at this cutoff : since the energy scale changes throughout the system , why should nt @xmath81 vary as well ? and , if @xmath82 varies , then it must obviously affect the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath38 . and indeed , there is a good reason why @xmath81 should vary with position : the continuous fermi gas is locally galilean invariant , and the only relevant microscopic scale is the inverse density @xmath83 , or equivalently @xmath84 .",
    "so the uv cutoff must simply be proportional to that scale : @xmath85 , for some dimensionless constant @xmath86 .",
    "coming back to the harmonic potential , we now make use of the coordinate system @xmath87 , with @xmath88 .",

    "we consider hamiltonian with a dispersion relation of the form @xmath226 which contains only odd fourier modes .",
    "the reason for choosing this special form is mainly technical . as we shall see it makes explicit computations much simpler due to the symmetries @xmath227 and @xmath228 .    in real time",

    "for example in the case of the standard cosine dispersion relation , using this procedure , we find the already known result @xmath247 , which can then be continued to real time @xmath248 .",
    "it is important to stress that the concept of conformal distance only makes sense in imaginary time : in principle only after computing @xmath249 in imaginary time we are allowed to make the analytic continuation to real time .    in practice",
