    "the acceleration of particles at a decelerating relativistic collisionless shock front constitutes a key building block of the afterglow model of gamma - ray bursts ( grb , mszros & rees 1997 ) .",
    "the standard phenomenology models the accelerated electron population as powerlaw @xmath1 , which radiates powerlaw photon spectra of the form @xmath2 , with a temporal decay index @xmath3 and a frequency index @xmath4 that are direct functions of @xmath5 , see e.g. piran ( 2005 ) for a review , or e.g. sari et al .",

    ", the situation however appears more complex , in spite of several remarkable results of the past decade .    on the microscopic level , for instance ,",
    "one understands the formation of a relativistic collisionless shock front in a weakly magnetized medium  such as the interstellar medium ( ism )  through the self - generation of intense small scale electromagnetic fields that act as the mediating agents for the transition from the far upstream unshocked state to the far downstream shocked state . the accelerated particles , as forerunners of the shock front , play a central role in triggering the microinstabilities that build the self - generated field .",
    "in turn , this self - generated microturbulence controls the scattering of these particles and it therefore directs the acceleration process , which becomes intricately non - linear .",
    "this general scheme has been validated so far in high performance particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations ( e.g. spitkovsky 2008 , keshet et al .",
    "2009 , sironi & spitkovsky 2009 , 2011 , martins et al . 2009 ) and understood on the basis of analytical arguments at the linear level ( e.g. medvedev & loeb 1999 , gruzinov & waxman 1999 , lyubarsky & eichler 2006 , lemoine & pelletier 2010 , 2011a , rabinak et al .",
    "the situation becomes more complex when one tries to bridge the gap between the limited simulation timescales and the much longer timescales probed by the observations .",
    "on such timescales , one would indeed expect that the microturbulence has died away ( e.g. gruzinov & waxman 1999 ) , yet grb afterglow modelling has generally pointed to a field strength close to a percent of equipartition permeating the blast , on day timescales .",
    "the origin of this field and its relation with the microturbulence behind the shock front has remained a nagging issue for many years .    on the observational level ,",
    "the recent era of rapid follow - up observations in the x - ray and gev domain has brought its wealth of surprises .",
    "the swift satellite has revealed x - ray afterglow light curves that differ appreciably in the @xmath6s domain from the canonical afterglow model ( nousek et al .",

    "to the present work , the _ fermi_-lat telescope has reported the discovery of long - lived ( @xmath7s ) gev emission in a fraction of observed bursts . in one case ( grb090510 ) , this emission has been measured almost contemporarily to emission in the x - ray and optical domains as early as @xmath8s ( ackermann et al .",
    "2010 , de pasquale et al .",
    "this long - lived high energy emission has been shown to fit nicely the predictions of a model in which the electrons cool slowly through synchrotron radiation in a background shock compressed magnetic field , without any need for microturbulence ( barniol - duran & kumar 2009 , 2010 , 2011a ; see also gao et al .",

    "2010 , razzaque 2010 and panaitescu 2011 for alternative points of view ) . given the past history in grb afterglow modelling , such a low magnetization of the blast may come as a surprise , but it may also point out that after all , the microturbulence does decay away as theoretically expected , and that the high level of turbulence seen on day timescales has been seeded through some other instability , but this comes at the price of an extraordinarily low external density @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "this interpretation is not considered here , see also sec .",
    "[ sec : fcons ] for further discussion . ] .",
    "depending on how fast and how far from the shock this microturbulent layer decays , it is likely to influence the particle energy gains from fermi acceleration , and losses through synchrotron radiation .",
    "the microturbulent layer must actually ensure the scattering of accelerated particles , because in the absence of microturbulence , these particles would be advected away with the transverse magnetic field lines to which they are tied and acceleration would not take place ( e.g. begelman & kirk 1990 , lemoine et al . 2006 , niemiec et al .",
    "2006 , pelletier et al .",
    "now , scattering in small scale turbulence is so slow that producing gev photons at an external blast wave of lorentz factor of a few hundreds represents a challenge , see e.g. kirk & reville ( 2010 ) , lemoine & pelletier ( 2011c ) , and see also piran & nakar ( 2010 ) , sagi & nakar ( 2012 )",
    ". it would be about impossible if the particles were to scatter in the microturbulent layer then radiate in the much weaker shock compressed background field .",
    "therefore , the interpretation of barniol - duran & kumar ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011a ) actually suggests that the microturbulence also plays a role in the radiation of gev photons , at the very least , if not in shaping the synchrotron spectra over the broad spectral range . in other words , the observation of extended gev emission and its early follow - up in other wavebands may be opening a rare window on the dynamics of the microturbulence in weakly magnetized relativistic collisionless shocks .    in this context , the present paper proposes to discuss the synchrotron spectra and more generally the afterglow spectrum @xmath11 of a decelerating relativistic blast wave , accounting for the time evolution of the microturbulence behind the shock front . while the initial motivation of this work was to provide a concrete basis for the scenario of barniol - duran & kumar ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011a ) , in which particles scatter in a time decaying microturbulence but radiate in a region devoid of microturbulence , it has become apparent that the possibility of decaying microturbulence opens a quite rich diversity of phenomena , which deserve to be discussed in detail",
    "this problem has been tackled by rossi & rees ( 2003 ) , who considered the simplified case of a homogeneous microturbulent layer that dies instantaneously beyond some distance , and by derishev ( 2007 ) , who showed that a particle radiating in a time evolving magnetic field can lead to spectra quite different from the standard one - particle synchrotron spectra .",
    "borrowing from the latest pic simulations , the present paper establishes a model of the microturbulence strength and coherence length evolving as powerlaws in time beyond some distance , until the decay saturates down to the background shock compressed magnetic field ; the present study then calculates the synchrotron spectra in this structure for various typical configurations ( slow cooling , fast cooling , with and without inverse compton losses ) and it discusses the problem of particle scattering , acceleration timescale and maximum photon energy in this setting . as such , it generalizes and encompasses these former studies , in the spirit of providing new tools with which one can analyse existing and forthcoming data . a brief comparison to present early afterglow observations",

    "the self - generation of microturbulence in the precursor of a relativistic collisionless shock front propagating in a very weakly magnetized medium appears both guaranteed and necessary to the maintenance of the shock .",
    "it is necessary because in the absence of a background magnetic field , self - magnetization is required to build up a magnetic barrier that initiates the shock transition .",
    "it is guaranteed because the development of microinstabilities follows naturally from the penetration of the unshocked plasma by the anisotropic beam of supra - thermal particles moving ahead of the shock ( e.g. medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "studies of non - relativistic collisionless magnetospheric shocks have shown that dissipation ahead of the shock is initiated by the reflection of ambient particles ( i.e. from the unshocked plasma ) on the shock front in the compressed magnetic field ( e.g. leroy et al .",
    "particle - in - cell simulations indicate that a similar phenomenon takes place at a relativistic unmagnetized shock , although the particles now reflect on the small scale electromagnetic fields self - generated by the microinstabilities ( e.g. spitkovsky 2008 ) .",
    "the reflected and accelerated particle populations merge together and trigger microinstabilities such as the weibel ( filamentation ) instability or oblique electrostatic instabilities , provided the precursor extends far enough for these modes to grow on the precursor crossing timescale ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 , 2011a ) . in a very weakly magnetized shock wave , with magnetization typical of the ism and blast lorentz factor @xmath21 , this appears guaranteed .",
    "as seen from the shock frame ( in which the shock front lies at rest ) the incoming kinetic energy is carried by the protons , the electrons carrying only a fraction @xmath22 of the incoming flow kinetic energy .",
    "energy transfer between the two species in the microturbulence leads to heating of the electron population , close to equipartition by the time it reaches the shock front , as observed in current pic simulations ( sironi & spitkovsky 2011 ) , see also the discussion in lemoine & pelletier ( 2011a ) .",
    "equipartition means that the incoming electrons carry lorentz factor @xmath23 , hence their skin depth scale ( downstream frame ) @xmath24^{1/2}\\sim c/\\omega_{\\rm pi}$ ] .",
    "the natural length scale of the electromagnetic structures produced by these microinstabilities is therefore the ion skin depth scale @xmath25 of the upstream plasma .",
    "particle - in - cell simulations not only validate the above general scheme , they also provide interesting constraints on the shape and evolution of microturbulence ahead and behind the shock front .",
    "two most recent and most detailed studies are of direct interest to the present work .",
    "chang et al . (",
    "2008 ) have performed long simulations of the evolution of micro - turbulence behind a relativistic shock front .",
    "the simulations have been computed for an unmagnetized pair plasma with relative lorentz factor @xmath26 between upstream and downstream . in weakly magnetized relativistic shock waves",
    ", the preheating of electrons in an electron - ion shock of similar configuration appears so efficient that for all practical matters , the downstream plasma behaves as a relativistic pair plasma ; hence the results of chang et al . (",
    "2008 ) can be transposed to an electron - ion shock .",
    "these simulations show that the microturbulence remains mostly static in the downstream rest frame , and that it is composed of an intermittent magnetic field structure that can be roughly described as a collection of magnetic loops and islands on typical length scales @xmath27 .",
    "one clear observation made in this work is that the small scale structures dissipate first , leaving the large scale clumps unaffected over the timescale of the simulation .",
    "chang et al . ( 2008 ) interpret this gradual erosion as collisionless damping , with a damping frequency @xmath28 ( @xmath29 denoting the spatial scale ) .",
    "if the magnetic turbulence is described in fourier space as a power law spectrum with most of magnetic power on small length scales , this implies a decay of the magnetic field strength accompanied by an evolution of the coherence scale @xmath30 .",
    "this is made explicit further below .",
    "the longest pic simulation so far for a relativistic shock is that of keshet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which extends to about @xmath31s ( comoving time ) . for values envisaged by barniol - duran & kumar ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011a ) and he et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to describe the gev extended emission , i.e. an ejecta of energy @xmath32erg , launched into a medium of density @xmath15@xmath10 with initial lorentz factor @xmath33 , the above timescale represents close to @xmath34% of a dynamical timescale at an observer time of a hundred seconds .",
    "keshet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) provide a detailed study of the magnetic field power spectrum of the turbulence and its evolution .",
    "they confirm most of the findings of chang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; in particular , they show that the magnetic field does decay behind the shock wave , but on rather long length scales compared to a skin depth @xmath25 .",
    "more importantly , they find that the presence of shock accelerated particles influences the decay timescale of the magnetic field with a general trend being that higher energy particles ensure a longer lifetime for the downstream microturbulence .",
    "given that the simulations of keshet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) extend for a time that is much smaller than the dynamical time , it has not had time to produce very high energy particles and to probe their impact .",
    "such high energy particles would tend to populate the magnetic perturbation spectrum with longer wavelength modes , which would then decay on longer timescales when downstream . in any event , this should not call into question what has been said above , since low energy particles carry most of the energy of a shock accelerated population with index @xmath35 .",
    "nevertheless , to probe how far the perturbation spectrum may be populated , one can conduct the following exercise .",
    "the maximal size of the precursor is given in a reasonable approximation by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 represents the gyration radius of the highest energy ions in the background upstream magnetic field , and @xmath38 the shock lorentz factor as measured upstream .",
    "this result is discussed in detail in plotnikov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) but it can be understood as follows .",
    "the highest energy ions are those that travel the furthest away from the shock , since electrons are generally accelerated to a smaller energy due to synchrotron losses ; furthermore , the particles gyrate by an angle @xmath39 over a timescale @xmath40 before being caught up by the shock front ( achterberg et al .",
    "2001 ) ; finally , the typical distance between the shock front and the particle is @xmath41 . assuming that the ions are accelerated on a timescale @xmath42 ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : accel ] ) and comparing the time available for acceleration with the age of the shock wave @xmath43 , one finds the precursor size @xmath44 .",
    "this indicates that the perturbation may well extend on several decades . in the absence of ions ,",
    "the precursor size would be set by the highest energy electrons ; balancing acceleration at a bohm rate ( as experienced downstream ) to synchrotron losses , one would find a precursor size about 20 times smaller for the adopted fiducial parameters , nevertheless much larger than the typical size of the fluctuations .    finally , keshet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest a damping frequency @xmath45 , which implies , when combined with the above result that the decay of the microturbulence might extend over quite long spatial scales .    following chang et al .",

    "equation  [ eq : alphat ] shows that the temporal decay index of the magnetic field behind the shock is inherently linked to how power is distributed on scales larger than the minimum scale @xmath62  as characterized by @xmath63  and to how fast small scale features are dissipated  as characterized by @xmath64 .",
    "the interpretation for this is clear : as small scales are erased , magnetic power is removed , but the rate at which the total strength erodes depends on how much strength is left at longer wavelengths . in fine , the uncertainty on @xmath65 is related to the sourcing of large wavelength fluctuations , which are likely related to the dynamics of high energy particles in the upstream .",
    "the above assumption @xmath56 has been discussed above .",

    "a closer inspection of their fig.3 however reveals that the initial exponential decay leaves way to a powerlaw decay at late simulation times ( thus meaning far downstream ) and by eye , one estimates @xmath78 .",

    "however , one must now impose @xmath408kev at @xmath6s , so that the secondary synchrotron component associated to @xmath152 cuts off below the x range , otherwise the x domain would fall in the fast cooling part of that synchrotron component .",
    "this constraint is fulfilled for the previous fiducial values @xmath402 , @xmath409 , @xmath410 and for @xmath411 .",
    "interestingly , the optical falls on the fast cooling part of the secondary synchrotron component at @xmath412s , since @xmath413 , therefore it decays less fast than the x range , with @xmath3 in marginal agreement with the observed value , as previously . the temporal slope in the optical at very early times @xmath414s provides an interesting check of this scenario : it should be flat or even weakly decaying , corresponding to case 3 in fig .  [",
    "fig : spec_icainfm42pp1 ] , which represents the analog of case 5 when @xmath156 . finally , as discussed before",
    ", one must require @xmath292 in order to produce gev photons directly in the undecayed part of the microturbulent layer . in this model ,",
    "the microturbulent layer produces both the gev and x photons , while the optical photons are produced in the shock compressed background field .",
    "according to the modelling of barniol - duran & kumar ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011a ) , the magnetization of the blast wave can take a large range of values , from @xmath415 to @xmath416 , depending on the external density .",
    "the latter value is given in de pasquale et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and corsi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , assuming very low upstream densities @xmath417@xmath10 .",
    "the general trend is that , independently of @xmath418 , the downstream magnetic field appears to coincide with the shock compressed magnetic field @xmath419 , corresponding to @xmath420 g .",
    "as noted in he et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , this generally implies large upstream magnetizations , since @xmath421 if @xmath253 is calculated in terms of @xmath152 , whereas the typical interstellar magnetization is more of the order of @xmath422 . as discussed in the previous sections , accounting for a decaying microturbulent layer alleviates the need for a large value of @xmath423 , which allows to reconcile the apparent @xmath253 with a more standard upstream magnetization .    nevertheless , it is interesting to ask what would happen if the upstream magnetization were truly high , e.g. if @xmath424 g and @xmath425@xmath10 . if @xmath426 is brought upwards by several orders of magnitude , then magnetization effects are to affect the shock physics .",
    "for instance , the pic simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2011 ) indicate that , for @xmath26 and @xmath427 , the shock is no longer mediated by the filamentation instability , but by the magnetic barrier associated to the ( transverse ) background magnetic field . as discussed in lemoine & pelletier ( 2010 , 2011a ) ,",
    "such a transition occurs when the growth timescale of the filamentation instability becomes larger than the timescale on which upstream plasma elements cross the shock precursor .",
    "this transition is predicted to occur when @xmath428 , with @xmath429 the fraction of shock energy carried by suprathermal particles . for @xmath430 ,",
    "the limiting magnetization becomes @xmath431 , to be compared with @xmath432 in terms of the above fiducial values .",
    "if @xmath433 , microturbulence can not be excited at the shock front , hence the downstream plasma must be permeated with the background shock compressed field only . however , one should not expect particle acceleration to proceed and indeed , the pic simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2011 ) indicate no particle acceleration for @xmath427 , @xmath434 . in order to obtain particle acceleration , one needs to find a source of turbulence in the downstream plasma , that would be able to scatter particles back to the shock front faster than they are advected .",
    "this possibility can not be discarded at the present time but it leads to some form of paradox : given that accelerated particles probe a length scale @xmath435 behind the shock if they interact with a magnetic field coherent over scales @xmath436 ( lemoine & revenu 2006 , lemoine et al .",
    "2006 ) , the instability needs to produce large scale modes on spatial scales @xmath437 with a growth timescale @xmath438 .",
    "the most reasonable scenario is thus to assume that microturbulence exists behind the shock , which restricts the possible values of the upstream magnetization . finally , if @xmath439 at some early time , but @xmath440 at some late time , because @xmath441 while @xmath426 remains constant , one should observe a very peculiar signature in the light curve due to the initial absence of an extended shock accelerated powerlaw ( lemoine & pelletier 2011b ) .",
    "current understanding of the formation of weakly magnetized collisionless shocks implies the formation of an extended microturbulent layer , both upstream and downstream of the shock .",
    "it is expected that the microturbulence behind the shock decays away on some hundreds of skin depth scales , and recent high performance particle in cell simulations have confirmed this picture . borrowing from these simulations , section  [ sec : synchspec ] has described the decay of the microturbulence as a powerlaw in time , with an index that can take mild or pronounced negative values , depending on the breadth of the spectrum of magnetic perturbations seeded immediately behind the shock .",
    "the synchrotron signal of a shock accelerated powerlaw of particles radiating in this evolving microturbulence has been calculated , and the results are reported in app .",
    "[ sec : appfnu ] .",
    "this calculation reveals a rather large diversity of possible signatures in the spectro - temporal evolution of the synchrotron flux of a decelerating relativistic blast wave , commonly parameterized under the form @xmath442 .",
    "the diversity of signals is associated with the possible values of the ratio @xmath160 , which characterizes whether the blast has had time to relax to the background shock compressed field or not by the comoving dynamical time @xmath135 , as well as the different cooling regimes ( fast cooling or slow cooling on timescale @xmath443 ) and the influence or not of inverse compton losses on the cooling history of particles .",
    "one point on which emphasis should be put , is that these signatures are potentially visible in early follow - up observations of gamma - ray bursts on a wide range of frequencies .",
    "the detailed synchrotron shapes and indices @xmath3 , @xmath4 are discussed in app .",
    "[ sec : appfnu ] .",
    "the microturbulence controls the scattering process of particles during the acceleration stage and it therefore controls the maximal energy of shock accelerated particles .",
    "detailed estimates for this maximal energy and for the corresponding energy of synchrotron photons have been provided .",
    "it has been argued that the observation of gev synchrotron photons from gamma - ray burst afterglows implies either that the microturbulence decays rather slowly ( as actually observed so far in pic simulations ) , or that the spatial extent of the undecayed layer of microturbulence is large enough to accomodate both the scattering and the cooling of these particles . in the former case , the stretching of the coherence length of the microturbulence that accompanies the erosion of magnetic power improves the acceleration efficiency and brings it close to a bohm scaling of the scattering frequency .",
    "finally , this paper has provided a concrete basis for the phenomenological models of barniol - duran & kumar ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011a ) , which interpret the extended gev emission of a fraction of gamma - ray bursts as synchrotron radiation of shock accelerated particles in the background shock compressed field .",
    "microturbulence must play an important role in these models for several reasons : ( 1 ) it is expected to exist behind the shock front of a weakly magnetized relativistic shock wave ; ( 2 ) it ensures the development of fermi acceleration , which can not proceed without efficient scattering ; ( 3 ) it controls the production of photons of energy as high as a few gev . using the predictions of the spectro - temporal dependence of @xmath145 with a dynamical microturbulence",
    ", one can reproduce satisfactorily the phenomenology of the models of barniol - duran & kumar ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011a ) , as examplified here with the particular case of grb090510 . in the present construction ,",
    "the decaying microturbulent layer permits the generation of high energy photons close to the shock front , while the low energy photons are produced away from the shock , where the microturbulence has relaxed to ( or close to ) the background shock compressed field . in this setting , the broadband early follow - up observations of gamma - ray bursts afterglows open an exceptional window on the physics of collisionless shocks .",
    "more work is certainly needed to study the phenomenology of evolving microturbulence and its relation with gamma - ray bursts light curves , in particular to define a proper observational strategy capable of inferring the characteristics of the microturbulence .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank p. kumar , z. li , g. pelletier and x .- y . wang for useful discussions .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the peps - pti program of the inp ( cnrs ) .",
    "it has made use of the mathematica software and of the levelscheme scientific figure preparation system ( caprio , 2005 ) ."
