    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are interacting binaries where a low mass star transfers matter onto a neutron star or black hole ( e.g. charles & coe 2004 ) .",
    "mass transfer takes place through an accretion disc where angular momentum is removed and gravitational potential energy converted into ( high - energy ) radiation .",
    "accretion discs evolve toward stationary states where the mass transfer rate through the disc , @xmath11 , adjusts towards the value of @xmath12 , the mass transfer rate supplied by the donor star .",
    "@xmath12 is driven by the binary / donor evolution and if @xmath13 m@xmath14 yr@xmath4 then mass transfer instability cycles ( outbursts ) are triggered ( van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "there are @xmath15200 bright ( l@xmath16 erg s@xmath4 ) lmxbs in the galaxy and most of them harbour neutron stars as implied by the detection of x - ray bursts / pulsations . on the other hand @xmath17 % of transient lmxbs",
    "are known to harbour accreting black holes , as demonstrated by dynamical studies of the faint companion stars , which is mainly possible when x - rays switch off ( but see hynes et al .",
    "we currently have dynamical evidence for 16 black hole lmxbs , with mass functions ranging from @xmath18 m@xmath14 up to @xmath19 m@xmath14 ( see charles & coe 2004 , mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) .",
    "the mass spectrum of black holes is of crucial astrophysical significance in constraining supernovae models and the equation of state of nuclear matter .",
    "clearly both more , and more accurate , black hole mass determinations are required before these issues can be fully addressed .",
    "bw cir is the optical counterpart of the x - ray transient gs 1354 - 64 , discovered in 1987 by the ginga satellite ( makino et al .",
    "it displayed x - ray properties reminiscent of bh transients i.e. a combination of a soft multi - bb component , with inner disc temperature of @xmath150.7 kev , plus a hard power - law tail with photon index 2.1 ( kitamoto et al .",
    "bw cir went into outburst again in 1997 but remained in a low / hard state throughout ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2000 , brocksopp et al .",
    "interestingly , its sky position coincides with two older recorded x - ray transients , cen x-2 and mx 1353 - 64 , discovered in 1966 and 1971 - 2 respectively ( see kitamoto et al .",
    "the former was the first x - ray transient ever discovered , with a peak soft x - ray luminosity of @xmath15 8 crab .",
    "if this activity were attributed to the same source , then it would make bw cir a bh transient with one of the shortest recurrence time ( @xmath20 8 - 10 years ) .",
    "however , the x - ray properties of these events were markedly different and hence , if caused by the same source it would indicate that it has displayed at least four distinct x - ray states .",
    "bw cir settles down in quiescence at r=20.5 ( martin 1995 ) and as yet no indication of the orbital period exists . a possible period of @xmath15 46 hr and 0.3 - 0.4 v - mag amplitude was reported during the 1987 outburst ( ilovaisky et al .",
    "1987 ) but it has not been confirmed . on the other hand , martin ( 1995 ) suggests a very tentative 15.6 hr periodicity with @xmath150.1 r - mag amplitude from quiescent data although the folded light curve does not mimic the classic ellipsoidal modulation . here",
    "we present the first spectroscopic detection of the companion star in bw cir and the analysis of its radial velocity curve .",
    "this provides the first dynamical probe for the presence of a black hole in this historical transient x - ray binary .",
    "we have observed bw cir using the fors2 spectrograph attached to the 8.2 m yepun telescope ( ut4 ) at observatorio monte paranal ( eso ) on the nights of 22 - 23 june 2003 , 14 - 15 and 25 - 27 may 2004 .",
    "a total of 55 spectra were collected with integration times varying between 1800 and 2000s ( depending on atmospheric conditions ) .",
    "the r1200r holographic grating was employed which , combined with a 0.7 arcsec slit , produced a wavelength coverage of @xmath215745 - 7230 at 70 km s@xmath4 ( fwhm ) resolution , as measured from gaussian fits to the arc lines .",
    "a he+ne+hg+cd comparison lamp image was obtained with the telescope in park position to provide the wavelength calibration scale .",
    "this was derived by a 4th - order polynomial fit to 37 lines , resulting in a dispersion of 0.74   pix@xmath4 and an rms scatter of 0.04  .",
    "instrumental flexure in our target spectra was monitored through cross - correlation between sky spectra and it was always less than 33 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these velocity drifts were removed from each individual spectrum , and the zero point of the final wavelength scale was fixed to the strong oi sky line at @xmath06300.304 .",
    "two additional 1800s spectra were obtained on the nights of 23 - 24 aug 2000 .",
    "here we used the r600r grism in combination with a 0.7 arcsec slit which resulted in a resolution a factor of two lower .",
    "we also observed several radial velocity and spectral type standards with exactly the same instrumental configuration on the nights of 17 may 2003 and 27 - 28 may 2004 .",
    "these cover spectral types f5iii - k7iii .",
    "all the images were de - biased and flat - fielded , and one - dimensional spectra extracted using conventional optimal extraction techniques in order to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio of the output ( horne 1986 ) .",
    "the 57 individual spectra were prepared for cross - correlation analysis by subtracting a low order spline fit to the continuum and rebinning the wavelength scale into a constant step of 34 km s@xmath4 per pixel .",
    "radial velocity points were extracted from our individual target spectra by cross - correlation with the radial velocity templates in the spectral range @xmath215950 - 7200 , after masking out all the emission , telluric and is absorption lines .",
    "the radial velocity points show clear night - to - night velocity changes which strongly points towards a @xmath15 2d orbit .",
    "this was best seen on the nights of 14 - 15 may 2004 , when two continuous 9hr runs could be obtained . in order to search for the orbital period we have performed a power spectrum analysis on the radial velocities obtained with the g5iii template and the results",
    "are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "frequencies longer than 0.5 cycles d@xmath4 ( periods @xmath22 2 days ) can be ruled out since they provide @xmath23 .",
    "the minimum @xmath24 ( = 2.98 ) is found at @xmath25 d@xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath26 days .",
    "however , we can not rule out the 1-year alias of @xmath27 days with @xmath28 .",
    "all other aliases have @xmath29 and can be rejected since they are not significant at the 99.99 % .",
    "we have performed least - squared sine - wave fits to the radial velocity curves obtained with all templates and find that spectral types in the range f5-g8iii give the best fits with @xmath24 in the range 2 - 3 .",
    "we decided to adopt the fitting parameters of the g5iii template since this provides the closest representation to the observed spectrum ( see below ) i.e.    @xmath30    @xmath31    where @xmath32 corresponds to standard phase 0 i.e. the inferior conjunction of the optical star .",
    "all quoted errors are 68 % confidence and we have rescaled the errors so that the minimum reduced @xmath33 is 1.0 . the @xmath34-velocity has been corrected from the template s radial velocity and we note that it is unusually large for black - hole binaries , and only comparable to the long period microquasars gro j1655 - 40 and v4641 sgr .",
    "figure 2 presents the radial velocity points , folded on the 2.54 day period , with the best sine fit superimposed .",
    "the mass function of bw cir , for the case of the short period solution , is @xmath35 , which defines a lower limit to the compact object s mass .",
    "this is substantially above any neutron star mass defined by all standard equations of state of condensed matter and hence we conclude that bw cir contains a black hole ( rhodes & ruffini 1974 ) .",
    "furthermore , our high instrumental resolution ( 70 km s@xmath4 ) enables us to measure the rotational broadening of the companion star and we can use this information to set a more stringent limit to the black hole mass . we have broadened our g5iii template from 50 to 100 km s@xmath4 in steps of 5 km s@xmath4 , using a gray profile ( gray 1992 ) with a linear limb - darkening law with coefficient @xmath36=0.62 , interpolated for @xmath0=6300   and @xmath37 5000 k ( see al - naimy 1978 ) .",
    "the broadened versions of the template star were multiplied by fractions @xmath38 , to account for the fractional contribution to the total light , and subsequently subtracted from the grand sum spectrum of bw cir .",
    "the latter was produced after averaging the 55 high resolution spectra of bw cir in the rest frame of the companion using the orbital solution above . a @xmath33 test on the residuals yields @xmath39 km s@xmath4 ( we have repeated the same experiment with all the templates and @xmath40 always ranges between 59 - 71 km s@xmath4 , see table 1 ) . in the case of a tidally locked",
    "roche - lobe filling star , @xmath40 relates to the @xmath41-velocity and the mass ratio @xmath42 through the expression @xmath43 ( wade & horne 1988 ) , from which we obtain @xmath44 and , therefore , @xmath45 . since bw cir does not exhibit x - ray",
    "eclipses , the inclination angle must be @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 ) and , consequently , the masses of the black hole and the companion star are @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .    for the longer period solution ,",
    "the black hole case is even stronger , with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . both the long period and large mass function are reminiscent of the black hole transient v404 cyg ( casares , charles & naylor 1992 )",
    "in order to refine the spectral classification we have averaged our individual spectra in the rest frame of the companion star , using our first orbital solution , and compared it with our optimally broadened spectral type templates in the range f5-k7iii using a @xmath55 minimization routine ( see marsh , robinson & wood 1996 for details ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath55 is obtained for spectral types",
    "g0iii - g5iii , which contribute 39 - 35 % to the optical flux in our spectral range ( see table 1 ) .",
    "figure 3 presents the averaged spectrum of bw cir in the companion s rest frame , together with our g5iii template/@xmath56 , which is very sensitive to @xmath57 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "] , broadened by @xmath58 km s@xmath4 .",
    "a normal g0iii - g5iii typically has @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( gray 1992 ) .",
    "however , the roche lobe equivalent radius of a @xmath61 star in a 2.5d orbit is @xmath62 and hence the companion is probably a lower mass , but more evolved star . since @xmath63 is constrained by the spectral classification ( @xmath20 5000 k ) , and the radius of the companion by the roche lobe geometry      we can apply the stefan - boltzmann relation to constrain the distance to bw cir . our orbital solutions yield @xmath65 m@xmath14 and hence @xmath66 r@xmath14",
    ". therefore the stefan - boltzmann relation gives @xmath67 which , combined with the bolometric correction and ( v - r ) colour for a g5iii star ( gray 1992 ) , gives @xmath68 .",
    "the dereddened magnitude of the companion star can be estimated from the observed quiescent magnitude ( r=20.5 ) , corrected for reddening ( @xmath69 ; kitamoto et al .",
    "1990 ) and our determined 65 % veiling .",
    "these yield @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the distance modulus relation provides a lower limit to the distance of 27 kpc which is substantially larger than the 10 kpc value proposed by kitamoto et al .",
    "even so , we note that this makes @xmath71 erg s@xmath4 at the peak of the 1987 outburst , still confidently below the eddington luminosity for a 10 m@xmath14 black hole .",
    "the distance has important implications for the observed systemic velocity .",
    "we have calculated the expected radial velocities of bw cir , due to galactic differential rotation , for a distance of 10 kpc and 27 kpc and these are -6 and 104 km s@xmath4 respectively ( nakanishi & sofue 2003 ) . the large distance scenario enables us to explain the observed @xmath34-velocity without invoking any kick during the formation of the black hole .",
    "although this scenario is the most attractive , we note the uncertainties involved in the is extinction value and this result requires careful consideration .",
    "our spectrum shows several is absorption features which can be used to obtain an independent estimate of the reddening .",
    "the strongest ones are the nai doublet for which we measure ew(d2)=1.37@xmath72 0.04    and ew(d1)=1.66@xmath720.04  . the empirical calibration of bardon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) yields @xmath73 but this should be regarded as a lower limit because nai(d2 ) is somewhat diluted by the broad hei @xmath05875 emission from the accretion disc .",
    "we have also measured the ew of the diffuse is band at @xmath06203 and find 0.24 @xmath720.02  . using the empirical calibration between ew and reddening from herbig ( 1975 )",
    "we get @xmath74 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with kitamoto et al.s reddening of @xmath75 , which was estimated by comparing the observed outburst colour of the optical counterpart with typical values of luminous lmxb given in van paradijs ( 1983 ) .",
    "this assumed that the x - ray irradiated disc dominated the optical emission , which is confirmed by our results here and hence give further support to our estimated distance of @xmath927 kpc .",
    "we note that this distance argues against bw cir and cen x-2 being the same object since it would make the 1966 outburst substantially super - eddington ( by more than an order of magnitude ) for a 10 - 20 m@xmath14 black hole .",
    "however , it does make bw cir similar to the black hole lmxb gx339 - 4 , where analysis of the nai is aborption features at high resolution has revealed complex velocity structures , consistent with a large distance of @xmath76 kpc ( hynes et al .",
    "we also note that this implies @xmath77 for the 1987 hard x - ray outburst which makes the most luminous hard state yet seen in a bh transient .",
    "additional constraints are provided by the position of the companion star in the h - r diagram , as compared with evolutionary sequences of single stars .",
    "our spectral analysis indicates that the companion is well fitted by a g0 - 5iii template and hence @xmath78 k ( gray 1992 ) . on the other hand , combining eq .",
    "1 with the stefan - boltzmann relation gives @xmath79 , where we have used m@xmath80 m@xmath14 .",
    "this defines a region in the h - r diagram ( see figure 4 ) to compare with evolutionary tracks of 1 - 2 m@xmath14 stars , computed using the code basti for the case of population i stars of solar metallicity .",
    "the diagram shows that the companion star is located in the hertzsprung gap or the lower part of the giant branch for @xmath81 m@xmath14 .",
    "since the luminosity of a roche lobe filling star depends weakly on @xmath82 , the companion can not be much more massive than @xmath83 ( for instance @xmath84 for @xmath85 ) . if it were a 1.6 m@xmath14 star with @xmath86 k , then @xmath87 and the distance would be @xmath15 33 kpc . however , we note the limitations of this crude estimate because the donor stars in x - ray binaries are not in thermal equilibrium and their h - r tracks may deviate significantly from single star evolution .",
