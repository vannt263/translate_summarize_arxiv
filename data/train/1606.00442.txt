    "it nonetheless remains unclear whether there is sufficient mass in comets to explain the amount of gas detected in these systems @xcite .",
    "regardless of the reason , the existence of this gas has implications for planet building .",
    "for example , while the measured gas masses are too small to contribute significantly to gas giant planet formation , the gas could still contribute to planetary atmospheres and potentially , for high enough gas masses , continue to affect small - grain dust .",

    "* ) is    @xmath184    where @xmath185 is the host star s surface temperature ( assuming it is a black body ) , @xmath186 is the equilibrium grain temperature if the grain were also a perfect black body , and @xmath187 is the actual grain temperature .",
    "the equation must be solved iteratively , but converges quickly . for hd141569 ,",
    "@xmath188 except at grains less than 10s of microns . to calculate @xmath189 ,",
    "@xmath183 is integrated over all frequencies and weighted by a black body of the given temperature , i.e. , @xmath190 taking @xmath191 k and the above grain size and spatial distribution , we find that @xmath192 .",
    "this result should be interpreted with caution .",
    "a steeper ( shallower ) solid size distribution can lead to significantly larger ( smaller ) masses .",
    "the result is also dependent on the internal density of the grains , as well as their effective albedo and emissivity . nonetheless , the results are illustrative that significant debris may be distributed between 10 and 50 au",
    ". the total mass of solids would be much larger should debris ( at a lower surface brightness ) be present at disk radii @xmath193 au , which would be consistent with single dish measurements ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the mass of an optically thin gas disk near lte can be calculated from the integrated line intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given a line flux of f@xmath194 , the average line intensity over the source s solid angle @xmath195 is @xmath196 where @xmath197 m is the average wavelength of the observations .",
    "the upper transition level column density of co is given by @xmath198 where @xmath199 ghz is the frequency of the molecular feature , and @xmath200 hz is the einstein absorption coefficient for the transition .    in the following , @xmath201 ( the upper transition level )",
    "unless otherwise noted ( such as in the summation ) . under the assumption that all @xmath202 energy levels are populated in lte , the total column density is given by @xmath203 and z is @xmath204 here , @xmath205",
    "s@xmath44 is the rotational constant@xmath206 , t is the gas temperature , z is the canonical partition function .",
    "the gas mass is then given by @xmath207 for a solid angle @xmath195 and distance to the object @xmath208 .",
    "taking a gas temperature of t @xmath209k , the minimum excitation temperature of the @xmath210 - 2 line , gives m@xmath211 , with the uncertainty propagated from the co flux density uncertainty in table 2 .",
    "the corresponding spatially averaged column density , @xmath212 , is @xmath213 .",
    "this is within the optically thin limit @xcite , but should not be taken as independent confirmation , as we assumed the gas to be thin for the mass calculation .",
    "if the gas is partly optically thick , then the actual co gas mass could be larger by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "as such , the co mass here could be interpreted as a lower limit . due to the uncertainty in the appropriate amount of the gas",
    ", we will only report the co mass as m@xmath214 to emphasize that the calculation has important unknowns .",
    "@xcite find a gas model with total mass of @xmath215 as constrained by lte models of gas temperature and density of co(1 - 0 ) and co(3 - 2 ) with carma and sma , respectively .",
    "if we assume the @xmath216 ism number density abundance ratio for h@xmath217 to co ( as in flaherty et al . ) , the inferred h@xmath218 gas mass from the alma observations is m@xmath219 . including additional metals would increase the total inferred gas mass to be slightly above @xmath220 , which is a factor of a few below the lower bound of the sma and carma based model .",
    "the observations and models altogether thus suggest that there is 1 to a few tens m@xmath221 of gas mass , assuming the ism scaling can be used , which is not obviously the case .",
    "additional caveats for these gas - mass estimates are discussed below .",
    "the morphology of hd141569 shows a dust disk extending out to about 56 au and an extended co gas component between about 30 and 210 au .",
    "this structure alone suggests that the system is an evolved transition disk .",
    "however , as discussed below , hd141569 may be better interpreted as a nascent debris system .",
    "the distinction is that the dust would be second generation , and any associated size distribution would reflect the clearing stages of planet formation rather than grain growth outcomes .      while most debris disks are expected to be extremely gas - poor , several younger debris systems ( e.g. , @xmath14 pic as discussed in the section 1 ) have been observed with co masses @xmath222 @xcite .",
    "hd141569 has a co gas mass @xmath223 , which , while younger , is comparable to these more evolved systems .",
    "the total gas mass of @xmath224 ( @xmath225 ) assumes an ism h@xmath218 to co abundance ratio .",
    "there is ultimately no reason to suspect that this conversion is applicable to hd141569 after 5 myr of evolution .",
    "if the gas disk is not optically thin , as assumed in the calculation above , then using co as a tracer of total gas could underestimate the actual gas mass @xcite .",
    "the current co disk should be expected to be depleted by photodissociation on timescales of @xmath226 yr @xcite , unless significant self - shielding is present . while the derived column density of co ( @xmath227 ) would contribute to some shielding , it is not obviously sufficient to prevent rapid dissociation .",
    "unless the gaseous disk is massive enough to prompt co formation in rough balance with photodissociation , the low inferred co mass creates a potentially serious timing problem for a primordial gas interpretation . instead ,",
    "if the gas is second - generation as produced by a planetesimal population ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , then the short dissociation timescale may not be problematic .",
    "rather , the problem now becomes whether sufficient mass is available to produce a low - mass gaseous disk , and if so , whether the planetesimal destruction rates would be consistent with the dynamics and the radiation field of the system .",
    "first , we note that the debris interpretation is corroborated by recent scattered light imaging @xcite .",
    "the images reveal very small grains present around 50 au , a region co - located with the mm grains observed here .",
    "such small grains should be removed by the system quickly by radiation pressure .",
    "the presence of the small dust grains in this region of the disk suggests that significant collisional evolution is indeed taking place .",
    "this , by itself , does not suggest that the gaseous disk is best described by a debris disk , but it motivates its consideration .",
    "if the co gas is depleted quickly through photodissociation on @xmath226 yr timescales , then for our estimate of the co mass , the co production rate must be @xmath228 .",
    "if a typical comet s mass is 10% co ice @xcite , then about 170 @xmath229 of cometary material must be destroyed per myr to balance photodissociation .",
    "this also implies that the total gas mass is within an order of magnitude of the co gas .",
    "based on cometary compositions , co can be accompanied by approximately similar abundances of h@xmath217o and co@xmath217 @xcite . ultimately , spectroscopic followup must be used to determine the gas composition and compare that with cometary abundances to further constrain this scenario observationally .",
    "is the required comet destruction rate plausible ? as discussed in section [ sec : debris ] , the alma continuum emission of 3.8 mjy with a collisional cascade model implies a total solid mass @xmath230 for @xmath231 in the inner disk . while the alma co observations are consistent with single - dish observations , the continuum flux measured here is lower than that found in previous studies .",
    "for example , single dish observations by @xcite find a continuum flux density of @xmath232 at 870 @xmath233 , and the sma observations measure @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "the much larger beam in these observations could be biasing the detected flux through contamination , but at face value , this suggests that there may still be considerable dust mass at larger radii whose emission is resolved out by the interferometer or is too low surface brightness to be detected at the sensitivity of these observations . as such , the true mass in solids may be larger than estimated here .",
    "for example , if we extend the collisional cascade model out to 210 au ( the extent of the co disk ) and normalize the mass to 12.6 mjy , the total solid mass is over 360 @xmath235 ( for @xmath180 km ) , where we have used @xmath236 to represent icy bodies .",
    "we stress that this estimate is very uncertain , as it depends on the assumed size distribution , planetesimal densities , grain albedos and emissivities , and distance to hd141569 . ] . provided that the estimated mass reservoir is dynamically accessible ( which is not explored here or obviously met )",
    ", there is potentially sufficient cometary material to produce the current co gas , although the system would not maintain this gas abundance for a protracted time without shielding .",
    "why should significant co gas only appear outside a radius of about 30 au ? as noted in the introduction , tenuous , warm co has been detected interior to the 50 au diameter cavity , but there is a large change in co abundance exterior to this distance , as revealed here .",
    "if the gas is indeed second generation , then the change in co abundance may reflect where significant co was incorporated into planetesimals at the time of their formation .",
    "in this paradigm , the entire disk is collisionally evolving , but significant co gas is only released in planetesimals that harbor a large fraction of co ice .",
    "alternatively , the reduced abundance of co interior to about 30 au may simply reflect the co photodissociation environment closer to the star and/or changes in self - shielding .",
    "the inner edge of the co could also be set by a region with a higher rate of stirring by planets and embryos @xcite .",
    "there is a potential contradiction , however , with this approach .",
    "the co mass was derived assuming that it is optically thin and in lte .",
    "if the gas is indeed second - generation , then it is not obvious whether there will be sufficient collisional partners to populate the rotational levels thermally . in this case",
    ", the true co mass could be significantly different from our estimates , and potentially even orders of magnitude more massive if non - lte effects do dominate @xcite . to check the degree to which the lte assumption may be valid",
    ", we use the alma measured co(3 - 2 ) integrated line flux to estimate the co(1 - 0 ) integrated line flux under lte conditions , which is approximately @xmath237 .",
    "the @xcite carma observations found an integrated line flux for co(1 - 0 ) of @xmath238 , making the estimate good to about a factor of two .",
    "ultimately , observations of disk chemistry are needed to understand the gas s origin .",
    "we have presented alma continuum ( @xmath40 ) and co(3 - 2 ) observations of hd141569 .",
    "the continuum observations show a dust disk that extends out to @xmath54 with a total continuum flux density of @xmath87 ( peak flux of @xmath239 ) .",
    "a rough lower limit to the amount of dust mass needed to explain the emission is @xmath240 . if the dust is due to the collisional evolution of debris ( rather than leftover millimeter grains from planet - building ) , then the millimeter flux reflects a comet and asteroid reservoir of @xmath241 for sizes @xmath242 ( assuming a collisional cascade ) .",
    "the continuum flux density found here is about a factor of three lower than that derived by single dish observations , suggesting that there is additional dust on larger spatial scales or at a lower surface brightness .",
    "the co disk observations reveal co extending from roughly the outer edge of the inner dust disk to about @xmath243 .",
    "the co(3 - 2 ) integrated flux density is @xmath6 ( peak flux of @xmath244 ) , which is consistent with single dish measurements . assuming that the gas is in lte and optically thin , the corresponding co mass is @xmath245 for a distance of 116 pc .",
    "based on modeling the velocity field , the disk is constrained to have a position angle @xmath246 , an inclination @xmath247 , and a system velocity @xmath248 km s@xmath44 .",
    "the gas velocities are consistent with orbiting a star of @xmath249 for the most probably inclination and a distance of 116 pc .",
    "the uncertainties represent the 95% confidence region computed from mcmc samples . instead , considering only the 1-@xmath112 distance uncertainty with our most probable mass yields @xmath133 .",
    "the channel maps show a localized flux enhancement of the disk to the western section of the disk .",
    "further detailed modeling of the system and higher resolution imaging are needed to properly constrain the full morphology . because co should photodissociate rapidly , the gas may require , in part , replenishment through collisions of comets , making the disk a debris system . while the required mass to do this may be high , it is potentially within plausible limits of the inferred debris field .",
    "observations probing the gas composition can be used to further constrain the origin of the gas , particularly as lte assumptions may not apply .",
