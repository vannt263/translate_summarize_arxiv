    "in this paper we study the problem of finding limits on the performance of the error - response performance , for a specific input , for lumped continuous - time siso systems .",
    "we are trying to find the best possible tracking performance achievable by a lumped ( or rational ) bibo  stabilising feedback controller .",
    "the theory to be presented is applicable to a large class of performance measures of practical significance , including overshoot for example .",
    "the simultaneous imposition of hard bounds on the output , in conjunction with overshoot minimisation , can also be handled , allowing consideration of the inevitable trade - off between rise - time and overshoot performance .",
    "these issues have been examined in a discrete - time setting in @xcite etc .",
    "the investigation of time - domain performance limitations is mathematically more challenging in continuous time than in discrete time . in the continuous - time case",
    "it is harder to derive conditions under which the performance limit for rational controllers is the same as for non - rational controllers ( _ rational approximability _ ) .",
    "the usual approach to these questions , is to express this performance ",
    "limit in the form of an optimization problem ( to be computed via duality methods ) , over an _ extended _ ambient signal ",
    "space , usually a standard _ dual _ banach space , to ensure _ existence of optimal elements _ and adequate duality properties . in general",
    ", these optimal elements will be non - rational , and hence suffer from implementability issues .",
    "it is then of importance to find if optimal performance may be approached using rational controllers . since these nonrational elements may be of doubtful practical utility ,",
    "one may well abandon the search for optima , and consider only the class of rational controllers in the optimization .",
    "this will permit more flexibility in the choice of the ambient banach space since it no longer need be a dual space .    in earlier works",
    "this underlying space was chosen to be @xmath0 ( dual of @xmath1 ) , but this choice of space does not , of itself , enforce the zero  steady  state  error condition .",
    "we shall incorporate this condition by using the space @xmath2 ( of continuous functions of time that tend to zero at infinity ) as our choice  it does the trick , but it is not a dual , so that existence of optimal elements is not assured .",
    "this choice of space is dictated by the continuity properties of the basic performance measures we study here .",
    "this is the approach followed in this paper .",
    "moreover , to side - step the rational  approximation issue , we consider directly the set of error signals due to the _ rational _ stabilizing controllers , and the optimization over its closure . under the conditions we assume in this paper , passage to this closure",
    "has no effect on the limit - of - performance .",
    "this clarifies the relation between the limit - of - performance and rational approximation , but requires an explicit characterization of the closure of the feasible set of error  signals .",
    "however , it is found that the closure itself has pleasant form , well - suited to application of the duality theory .",
    "that is , by exploiting the structure of this set we have that rational approximability holds by definition .",
    "further , we consider a general class of performance functionals and set up a general duality framework for the analysis of such problems ( in the style of @xcite for the case of discrete time ) .",
    "these functionals include as special cases the well - known classical criteria of overshoot , undershoot and others .",
    "this treatment also allows a general fixed input ( not just a step ) .",
    "the classical criteria just mentioned , are continuous with respect to the supremum ",
    "norm on the signal space  this fact motivating our choice of @xmath2 as the ambient space .    in the literature",
    "to date the optimization is performed over error signals in the bigger space @xmath3 , with attendant consideration of rational approximability . in @xcite",
    "the set of candidate controllers is expanded , moreover , to include those that may not be bibo  stabilising , and the limiting error is unconstrained .",
    "asymptotic stability and zero steady state error are then enforced through selection of suitable output weighting .",
    "use of the space @xmath3 to formulate the primal has the advantage that the optimal solution for the primal problem is guaranteed to exist for the @xmath3 norm minimisation problem . for the more general cost functions considered in this paper , however , it is clearly not to be expected that an optimal solution will in general exist , neither in @xmath3 , nor in @xmath2 .",
    "we provide a derivation of a dual formulation covering a wide range of problems , extending known results .",
    "the continuous time @xmath3 norm minimisation problem for a fixed input was first considered in @xcite , but rational approximability was not addressed .",
    "miller @xcite gave a rational approximation result for response to a step reference input .",
    "the construction of rational suboptimal controllers for the continuous time @xmath3 norm minimisation problem has been considered in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "yoon @xcite and @xcite extended the class of optimisation criteria , by considering convex combinations of overshoot and undershoot ( with a step - input ) and in these latter papers is found the first application of conjugate  duality techniques to continuous - time control .",
    "the constraints for the dual formulation presented here can be interpreted as arising from an open  loop dynamic system .",
    "these structural insights are exploited to derive new results on the influence of plant pole / zero locations , or rise  time constraints on achievable performance , giving results of identical form to those obtained for discrete time in @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are applicable for general reference inputs ( @xcite assumes step - input ) and to systems with more general exogenous inputs , for example a fixed disturbance entering at the plant output . for definiteness and simplicity",
    "our set - up is the tracking problem shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "an important design consideration is the extent to which performance objectives are in conflict .",
    "it may not be possible , for example , to find a single controller that reduces both the @xmath4norm of the error , and the negative  error ( overshoot ) , in response to a step , to close to their fundamental limits .",
    "furthermore , the extent to which there is conflict depends on the location of the unstable poles and non - minimum - phase zeros of the plant .",
    "the dual provides such information . another trade - off important in practice",
    "is that between rise  time and transient performance measures such as overshoot and undershoot .",
    "the answer to this question also depends on the location of the poles and zeros of the plant , and again the interpretation of the dual as an open - loop dynamic system provides insight and new results .",
    "also in this paper we extend known results on the minimization of the  maximum - peak to minimum - peak \" value of the error response , that is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the error response ; we term this quantity _",
    "fluctuation_. for some applications fluctuation minimization is of more concern than @xmath4norm minimization .",
    "for some plants there then arises an unavoidable trade - off ; either a small @xmath4norm of the error response , or a low fluctuation , must be sacrificed .",
    "to what extent they are in conflict depends on the location of the poles and zeros of the plant , and again it is the dual that provides answers .",
    "we shall write @xmath5 for the real interval @xmath6 . @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 denote respectively , the spaces of real polynomials , and real  rational functions , in the complex variable @xmath9 .",
    "the set of all proper stable members of @xmath8 ( i.e.  those with no pole in the closed complex right - half - plane nor at infinity ) is denoted by @xmath10 .",
