    "weak lensing provides a potentially powerful probe of mass fluctuations in the universe (; and references therein ) .",
    "three independent groups have recently presented estimates of the shear variance from deep ` blank - field ' ccd imaging surveys .",
    "( hereafter vwme+ ) measured the shear variance in circular cells of radii ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ; ( hereafter bre ) measured the shear variance in square cells of side @xmath8 and ( hereafter wtk+ ) have provided estimates of the shear - shear correlation function at separations @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here",
    "we present shear variance measurements from @xmath12 square degrees of deep photometry obtained as part of our ongoing weak lensing survey .",
    "we find results which are broadly in good agreement with the recently published estimates .",
    "the data were taken at the 3.6 m cfht telescope using the @xmath13 pixel uh8k camera at prime focus .",
    "the camera delivers a field size of @xmath14 with @xmath15 pixels .",
    "our survey strategy has been to target blank fields in six widely separated areas for ease of scheduling , and in each area we plan to make @xmath16 or so pointings scattered over a region of extent @xmath17 . in january 1999 the uh8k was replaced by the cfh12k camera . by that time we had completed 1 hour integrations in both v and i for two pointings in each of three areas .",
    "the field names , centers and also the estimated seeing are given in table [ tab : fields ] .",
    "one of the 8 devices in the mosaic ( lying in the nw corner of our images ) has very poor charge transfer efficiency and the data from this device were discarded .",

    "the bre result is shown as presented in their paper and with total error estimate including cosmic variance .",

    "presented estimates of the ellipticity correlation function @xmath20 .",
    "we have converted their @xmath21 to an equivalent shear variance using formulae from with @xmath22 and assuming a spectral index @xmath23 .",
    "the lower panel shows the variance multiplied by averaging box size @xmath24 . for a @xmath23 spectrum , corresponding to a mass auto - correlation function @xmath25 , this quantity should independent of scale .    at small scales",
    "@xmath26 arcmin there seems to be remarkably good agreement between the independent estimates .",
    "note that the measurements were made using three separate observing facilities . at @xmath27",
    "we find @xmath28 .",
    "this about a factor 4 - 5 lower than the prediction for a light - traces mass @xmath29 cosmology , and an effective redshift for the background galaxies @xmath30 @xcite .    at larger scales",
    "the shear variance we find falls below that of wtk+ .",
    "their largest scale estimates appear to conflict with our null result at about the 2-sigma level .",
    "our large - angle results are also smaller than the @xmath31 , @xmath32 theoretical model predictions .",
    "for an effective background galaxy redshift of @xmath33 these measurements probe mass fluctuations in a shell peaked at @xmath34 . at this redshift",
    "the @xmath2 field size corresponds to a comoving distance of about @xmath35mpc , so the cell variances presented here probe scales in the range @xmath36mpc . on the smaller end of this scale we find very good agreement with recently announced estimates from other groups , and also with canonical cosmological theory predictions .",
    "it is hard to definitively rule out the possibility that the small angle measurements are inflated by systematic errors , but one can safely rule out theories such as light - traces mass high density models which predict shear variance a factor @xmath37 higher than our results .    on larger scales our measurements are extremely precise , yet we find only a null detection for our largest cells .",
    "these results show that on large scales the rms shear is at most a fraction of a percent .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between these results and the theoretical predictions is quite interesting , and suggests a steepening of the mass correlation function at scales @xmath38mpc .",
    "more data are needed however to definitively confirm this .",
    "the results here were extracted from data taken at the canada france hawaii telescope .",
    "the analysis was supported by nsf grants ast95 - 00515 , ast99 - 70805 .",
