    "numerical simulations with fermions are notoriously difficult .",
    "the reason is that the minus signs due to pauli statistics give rise to cancellation effects . in quantum field theories",
    "the fermions are usually integrated out and the fermion determinant appears as a weight factor . even in cases where the fermion determinant is real and positive its numerical treatment is very costly",
    ", since it essentially couples all degrees of freedom with each other and the individual contributions have changing signs .",
    "finding alternative strategies for dealing with fermions would considerably improve the quality of numerical simulations .",
    "such strategies could either be new algorithms ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a prominent example ) or a reformulation of the problem .",
    "here we discuss the latter : in @xcite an alternative representation was given for a two - dimensional fermionic quantum field theory , the gross - neveu model .",
    "the partition function was rewritten as a sum over closed loops where each contribution has a real positive weight .",
    "this allows for a new approach to simulate the model which avoids dealing with the fermion determinant .",
    "this paper presents the first test of the loop approach for the gross - neveu model in a numerical simulation , and we explore the prospects and limitations of using loop - type representations in a numerical simulation of a fermionic system .",
    "our results demonstrate that the method is promising and it is worthwhile to pursue it in higher dimensions . in higher dimensions loop representations of quantum field theories",
    "are known , but so far have exclusively been used in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "our study here , although 2-dimensional , is performed at arbitrary coupling .",
    "we are currently exploring the generalization to higher dimensions and believe that for certain four - fermi interactions , representations similar to the one used here can be found and successfully applied in numerical simulations .",
    "for gauge theories the situation is more complicated .",
    "since gauge fields are oriented one has to use oriented loops dressed with the gauge links and complex phases appear .",
    "this was seen in the schwinger model , where a loop representation exists @xcite , but a numerical simulation suffers from the fermion sign problem . upon going to the strong coupling limit , the sign problem disappears @xcite and a numerical simulation with loops again unleashes its power @xcite .",
    "four - fermi interactions may be generated with a hubbard - stratonovich transformation using scalar fields .",
    "these do not introduce complex phases and a loop representation without signs is possible .",
    "we begin with discussing the gross - neveu model @xcite and its loop representation . in the continuum",
    "the action of the gross - neveu model is given by @xmath0 with @xmath1 \\ , \\psi(x ) \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ s_s & = & \\frac{1}{2 g } \\int d^2 x \\ , \\varphi(x)^2 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are grassmann valued vectors of @xmath4 flavors of 2-spinors and we use vector / matrix notation for both , spinor and flavor indices .",

    "the gross - neveu model is well understood analytically ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and has been analyzed on the lattice in various settings @xcite .",
    "as it stands , the path integral ( [ partitionfunction ] ) is only formally defined and a cutoff needs to be introduced .",
    "here we use lattice regularization , which replaces the euclidean space time @xmath8 by a finite regular lattice @xmath9 . the path integral ( [ partitionfunction ] ) is well defined when the measure is understood as the product over individual measures over the fields living on the lattice points .",
    "the action is discretized using the wilson formulation such that it reads @xmath10 \\ , \\psi(x )",

    ", the @xmath4-flavor lattice gross - neveu model ( [ latticeaction ] ) can be mapped into a model of 2@xmath4 sets of loops @xcite . for convenience",
    "we will often refer to the loops in different sets as blue , red etc .  loops . within each set",
    "the loops are non - oriented , closed and self - avoiding . however ,",
    "when loops belong to different sets , e.g. , a red and a blue loop , they may touch or cross each other .",
    "the partition function of the lattice gross - neveu model is then a sum over all possible configurations of the loops in the 2@xmath4 sets .",
    "each configuration has a positive weight computed from the loops .",
    "although @xcite gives the partition function for arbitrary @xmath4 , we here only quote the one - flavor expression which we use in our simulation . for @xmath11",
    "we need two sets of self - avoiding loops , red and blue , denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the one - flavor partition function in the loop representation reads ( up to an overall normalization factor ) @xmath14 in this formula @xmath15 is the total number of corners for both red and blue loops .",
    "thus every corner contributes a factor of @xmath16 to the weight of a configuration .",
    "@xmath17 is the number of lattice sites which are singly occupied by either @xmath12 or @xmath13 and @xmath18 is the number of doubly occupied sites .",
    "we remark that , since the loops in the two sets are self avoiding , double occupation can appear only when a red and a blue loop cross our run alongside each other .",

    "different types of boundary conditions in the two representations lead to finite size effects : in the loop representation we need to have closed loops and in a finite volume the loops can wind around the compact lattice .",
    "the loop configurations fall into three equivalence classes , @xmath24 , depending on the numbers of red and blue non - trivially winding loops ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath25 ( even - even ) : the total number of windings for both , red and blue loops is even for both directions . @xmath26",
    "( even - odd ) : one of the colors has an odd number of windings for one of the directions .",
    "@xmath27 ( odd - odd ) : both colors have an odd number of windings in one of the directions .",
    "these equivalence classes can not be linked in a simple way to the boundary conditions in the standard representation which we discussed above . however , below we will demonstrate that the boundary effects vanish as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 denoting the volume .",
    "the numerical simulation of the gross - neveu model now is performed directly in the loop representation ( [ zloop ] ) using a local metropolis update ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we update the red and the blue loops alternately , by performing a full sweep through the lattice for one of the colors and treating the other one as a background field .",
    "a sweep consists of visiting all plaquettes of the lattice . for each plaquette",
    "we generate a trial configuration by inverting the occupation of the color we want to update for all the links in the plaquette .",
    "this guarantees that all loops remain closed .",
    "furthermore new loops may be generated when all links of the plaquette are empty .",
    "when the trial configuration violates the self - avoiding condition it is rejected immediately and the algorithm tries the next plaquette . otherwise the trial configuration is accepted with the metropolis probability @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the change in the number of corners and @xmath32 are the changes in the occupation numbers .",
    "the initial configuration can either be the empty lattice ( for @xmath25 ) or has one or two winding loops ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the observables we discuss here are all first and second derivatives of the free energy @xmath33 , and can be written as moments of the occupation numbers .",
    "in particular for the chiral condensate and its susceptibility , which in the standard language are given by @xmath34 we quote the corresponding expressions in terms of occupation numbers and their fluctuations , @xmath35\\ ,   \\big\\langle ( n_0 - \\langle n_0 \\rangle ) ^2 \\big\\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; [ f_2 ^ 2 - 2 f_1 ^ 2 f_2 ] \\ ,    \\big\\langle ( n_1 - \\langle n_1 \\rangle ) ^2 \\big\\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; 2 f_1 ^ 2f_2 \\ ,   \\big \\langle ( n_0 + n_1 - \\langle n_0 + n_1 \\rangle)^2 \\big\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & &   - \\ ; [ 4f_1 ^ 4 - 2f_1 ^ 2 f_2 ] \\langle n_0 \\rangle - f_2 ^ 2 \\ , \\langle n_1",
    "\\rangle \\big ) \\ ; . \\label{occobs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced @xmath36 , the total number of empty sites , i.e , sites visited by neither a red nor a blue loop .",
    "equivalent formulas can be derived for the internal energy , the heat capacity as well as for derivatives of the free energy with respect to the coupling @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath37-point functions may be treated as usually by introducing source fields and differentiating with respect to them .",
    "this gives expressions involving correlators of _ local _ occupation numbers .",
    "finally , the generalization of the above formulas to an arbitrary number of flavors is straightforward .",
    "for @xmath38 as a function of @xmath21 for 2 different lattice sizes .",
    "we compare the simulation in the loop representation ( symbols with error bars ) to the exact result from fourier transformation ( curves).,width=321 ]    in this section we present some selected results which serve to illustrate the advantages of the loop approach , but also allow to assess its limitations . in order to compare with traditional methods",
    ", we performed a reference simulation of the gross - neveu model using standard methods .",
    "the fermions were integrated out giving rise to the fermion determinant in a background configuration of the scalar field @xmath6 .",
    "these background configurations were computed according to the gaussian distribution of @xmath39 , and the determinant was used as a factor for reweighting .",
    "this is possible , since the eigenvalues of the dirac matrix come in complex conjugate pairs , and the scalar field does not have topological modes which could give rise to zero eigenvalues .",
    "thus the fermion determinant is always strictly positive .",
    "we stress that the reweighting in the standard formulation works only in two dimensions due to the numerical cost of evaluating the determinant .",
    "however , for our problem where the scalar fields are independent gaussians at each site , reweighting has the big advantage , that autocorrelation is avoided .",
    "alternative strategies such as hybrid monte carlo , can not make use of that advantage .",
    "another important conceptual point has to be addressed : for the free case , @xmath40 , the standard representation allows for an exact solution with the help of fourier transformation . in the loop formulation , however , the case @xmath38 is not special at all .",
    "thus @xmath38 is the optimal point for testing the power of the loop approach to the limits because we have exact results on almost arbitrary large volumes , which we use to compare with the data of the loop simulation . since the weight factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 of eq .",
    "( [ f1f2 ] ) are smooth functions of @xmath22 and @xmath21 it is reasonable to transfer the experience obtained with the loop approach at @xmath38 to nearby values of @xmath22 .",
    ".,width=321 ]    thus we begin our assessment of the loop approach at @xmath38 . in figs .  1 and 2 we compare the loop results in the @xmath25 sector ( symbols ) with those from fourier transformation ( curves ) .",
    "we use two volumes for the comparison , a relatively small lattice of size @xmath41 and a considerably larger one , @xmath42 . for the simulation in the loop approach at each value of @xmath21 we typically performed @xmath43 sweeps of our local update for both colors for equilibration and used @xmath44 measurements of the observables separated by @xmath45 pairs of sweeps .",
    "the observables were calculated using the occupation number representation ( [ occobs ] ) and the statistical error was computed with the jackknife method .",
    "1 shows that already on the small lattice the data points are very close to the exact result .",
    "the largest discrepancy is seen near @xmath46 , the chiral point where the fermions become massless . for the larger lattice",
    "the data points fall exactly on top of the analytic result .",
    "the situation is similar for the susceptibility in fig .  2 .",
    "for the small lattice we find a clear finite size effect , a shift of the susceptibility curve . on the larger lattice",
    "the agreement is almost perfect and only at the chiral point @xmath46 we still see a slight discrepancy .",
    "we remark , that the decrease of the minimum of @xmath47 with increasing volume @xmath29 does not signal a phase transition ( at @xmath48 there is no discrete symmetry that could be broken spontaneously ) . the minima decrease only logarithmically with @xmath29 . for",
    "@xmath38 it can be shown exactly that @xmath47 diverges logarithmically when removing the ir cutoff .",
    "for @xmath49 we could fit the minimum of @xmath47 as obtained from the simulation very reliably with @xmath50 .",
    "also the comparison with the results from the standard approach shows that the largest discrepancy is found near the chiral point , which , however , vanishes quickly with increasing volume .    an important part of comparing the standard and the loop approach is to test how the different types of boundary effects scale with the volume and at what rate the perfect equivalence of the two representations is reached with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "we assess this question directly in the loop approach : at a fixed point @xmath51 in parameter space we compute the chiral condensate @xmath52 for the three different equivalence classes @xmath24 introduced above .",
    "this is repeated for several volumes @xmath29 and in fig .",
    "3 we plot the discrepancy of the results as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "the data shown in the plot are for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the plot @xmath56",
    "denotes the discrepancy between the @xmath26 and @xmath25 results and @xmath57 is the splitting between @xmath27 and @xmath25 .",
    "also a comparison of @xmath52 to the results from the standard approach with mixed boundary conditions shows a 1/@xmath53 behavior .",
    "the splitting @xmath58 can be analyzed with the help of mean field theory .",
    "one finds that it should behave as @xmath59 .",
    "we performed a fit of our data to the form @xmath60 and found values of @xmath61 which are close to @xmath62 for all analyzed values of @xmath51 ( see also fig .  3 ) .",
    "thus mean field arguments as well as our numerical findings indicate , that the finite volume effects scale as @xmath28 .",
    "in this letter we have explored an alternative formulation for fermionic systems using the example of a 2-dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "the representation in terms of fermion loops allows one to simulate the system without having to use fermion determinants .",
    "an important aspect is that in the loop formulation used here we are not restricted to the case of strong coupling but can work at arbitrary @xmath22 . in this exploratory study",
    "we simulate the model using a simple local update and compare the outcome to analytic results and the data from a simulation in the standard approach .",
    "many observables can be expressed in terms of occupation numbers and their correlators .",
    "we show that finite size effects decrease like @xmath28 and thus the thermodynamic limit , where the loop representation becomes exact is approached rapidly .",
    "an important issue is of course the assessment of the gain in numerical efficiency when using the loop algorithm . already with the local algorithm used here a considerable increase of the accessible volumes",
    "was found . using the same small cluster of pc s",
    "the standard approach could be used on lattices with a maximum volume of @xmath63 , while in the loop formulation we were able to simulate systems up to @xmath64 , which is an increase of the volume by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "this enormous improvement is a strong incentive to search for loop representations also in higher dimensional fermion systems and for four - fermi interactions no principal obstacles seem to appear .",
