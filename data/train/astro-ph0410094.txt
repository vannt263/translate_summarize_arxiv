    "direct observation of galaxies in their formative stages is proving to be an extremely powerful approach for understanding how galaxies form and grow .",
    "the key physical processes are , in principle , directly observable . however , the primary challenge for direct observations is that high redshift galaxies are faint and small , and the rest frame observations are often in the uv , a spectral region that has been poorly characterized locally  though current observations by galex are beginning to provide the needed @xmath12 benchmark .    a key consideration , of particular relevance for this workshop , is that studies of high redshift galaxies are complementary to what can be learned from nearby galaxies  although strongly synergistic may be a more appropriate characterization .",
    "the ability to do both extraordinarily detailed `` archaeological '' studies of nearby galaxies at one epoch ( now ) contrasts with the much more superficial characterization that can be carried out for distant galaxies .",
    "the resolution at high redshift , @xmath13 kpc arcsec@xmath14 from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , is dramatically worse than can be achieved at @xmath17 , and presents a serious challenge , even with hst .",
    "the discussion that has taken place at this workshop about bars in @xmath18 galaxies is an example of how small changes in resolution ( from wfpc2 to acs ) can lead to significant differences in conclusions about the properties of high redshift galaxies .",
    "nonetheless the opportunity to measure the properties of galaxies directly , even at the global level , to within @xmath19 gyr from the big bang , is exciting and valuable , even if the details are mostly lacking .    in the talk by ken freeman ( this volume ) ,",
    "a further example was given of how observations at high and low redshift combine to challenge our view of galaxy evolution .",
    "the thin disk of our galaxy appears to have been undisturbed for some 10 gyr , corresponding to a relatively quiescent life since @xmath20 .",
    "yet large disks appear to become rare around @xmath21 .",
    "are we missing many such disks in our observations ? or were we just `` lucky '' in the milky way .... ?",
    "a very interesting constraint on the nature of high redshift galaxies comes from the cosmic baryon budget as discussed by fukugita , hogan and peebles ( 1998 ) .",
    "they compiled a census of where the baryons are at @xmath12 .",
    "the vast majority are in gas or plasma ( 83% ) . of the 17% locally that are in stars ,",
    "73% are in spheroids ( bulges / ellipticals ) , 25% are in disks and 2% are in late - type galaxies . thus a key issue at high - redshift ( at @xmath22 ) is identifying and characterizing spheroid ( bulge and elliptical ) buildup .",
    "most of the star formation at high redshift must be part of the buildup of spheroids , with different classes of objects ( lbgs , evolved @xmath23 objects , scuba sources etc ) exemplifying different phases of this process .",
    "this is particularly true if the 25% in disks was assembled relatively late  maybe after @xmath24 ? .",
    "the observational goals of high  redshift galaxy studies have largely been to establish global properties , such as luminosity , sizes , colors , structure ( scale lengths , shapes , etc ) , dust content , kinematics , etc . from these",
    "we hope to determine the galaxy luminosity function , stellar ( from seds ) and dynamical mass distributions , luminosity density and its evolution , star formation rate evolution , mass buildup , merging rate , agn role , etc .",
    "the lack of resolution and the inherent faintness of high  redshift galaxies results in a `` morphology challenge '' .",
    "this basic problem is further exacerbated by our difficulty in obtaining high spatial resolution observations in the rest ",
    "frame optical .",
    "our high resolution images ( hst acs ) are essentially all in the optical , which is in the rest  frame uv at @xmath25 . at these wavelengths , evolved populations become faint and the effect of dust is magnified",
    ". comparisons ( morphology , structure , shape , etc . ) with low redshift optical samples are then subject to biases .",
    "high spatial resolution ir ( @xmath26 @xmath27 m ) imaging such as that from wfc3 on hst , and later from jwst , are key steps that will alleviate this problem .",
    "spitzer of course , will provide remarkably valuable data on high  redshift objects , but its very low spatial resolution precludes any measurement of structure .    from the perspective of high  redshift galaxy studies one of the most significant developments of the last decade has been a much needed refinement of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the large uncertainties in timescale that permeated galaxy formation discussions in the 1980s and 1990s have largely evaporated .",
    "the wmap results ( bennett et al .  2003 ) , combined with other constraints , have enabled us to compare timescales from local observations with redshift `` ages '' with increased confidence .    with @xmath28 gyr",
    ", it is of interest to note a few timescales and epochs relevant for galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "some useful numbers : @xmath6 corresponds to an age of @xmath29 gyr ; redshift 5 is when the universe is @xmath3010% of its current age ; redshift 2 is at @xmath3025% , or about 3.4 gyr from recombination ; and redshift 0.8 corresponds to an age @xmath31 gyr , when the universe was just half its present age . at the earliest times for galaxies",
    ", the universe appears to be reionized by @xmath10 , @xmath321 gyr from recombination , with reionization likely starting at @xmath33 ( kogut et al .",
    "this requires that the first uv - bright stars occurred within @xmath34 gyr of recombination . since the first qsos",
    "are seen at @xmath35 , deep potential wells must be in place by that time ( within @xmath0 gyr of the first stars forming ! ) .",
    "by @xmath36 , all the significant elements of the classic hubble sequence seem to be in place ( though not necessarily in the same proportions as today ) .",
    "this is rather striking .",
    "we tend to be rather cavalier about the @xmath37 epoch , treating it as but a `` slightly modified version of now '' .",
    "yet @xmath38 is around @xmath39 gyr ago , more than half the age of the universe .",
    "it is fascinating to think that the galaxy population of today was largely in place by @xmath37 , and that this buildup happened between @xmath10 , or somewhat before , and @xmath40 , or over a timespan of only a few gyr .",
    "another way of describing this change is to note that around @xmath41 is when the morphological characteristics of galaxies appear to undergo a change to much less structured forms ( even taking into account the tendency of uv observations to enhance star  forming regions relative to older , smoother populations ) .",
    "much less regular galaxies , like those common in the deepest hst images ( the hdfs and the udf ) , appear to become the dominant forms .",
    "for galaxies , one could think of three epochs : `` reionization '' at @xmath42 , the `` weird '' ages from @xmath30@xmath43 , and the `` normal '' galaxy epoch from @xmath44 onwards .",
    "dramatic examples of galaxies at higher redshifts can be seen in the hst udf images ( see , e.g. , the color plate in this volume from the udf ) .",
    "a fascinating recent result is that the star formation rate ( and mass buildup ) in galaxies is approximately constant from @xmath45 to @xmath44 ( the first 50% of time ) and then decreases significantly ( @xmath46 ) to @xmath12 .",
    "a well - known , but nonetheless extremely critical observational problem for studies of high  redshift galaxies is that surface brightness goes as @xmath47 .",
    "this surface brightness dimming dramatically impacts the detectability of galaxies at high redshift ( corresponding to @xmath30600@xmath48  or 7 mag  from @xmath12 to @xmath49 ) .",
    "we are fortunate to have a number of powerful new tools with which carry out the needed observations .",
    "the remarkable new spectrographs on large ground - based telescopes ( deimos , virmos , imacs , for example ) have revolutionized our ability to take large numbers of redshifts .",
    "hst , chandra and spitzer each contribute unique and important information on the nature of high  redshift objects . arguably though , it is the advanced camera on hst ( ford et al .",
    "2003 ) that is providing the most valuable and unique data at this time ( though the impact of spitzer will undoubtedly grow ) .",
    "redshift galaxies are small , and therefore it has only been through the capabilities of hst and the acs that we have been able see structural details . in short ,",
    "the advent of the hst acs has greatly increased our ability to `` watch galaxies form and grow '' .",
    "the sensitivity , resolution and excellent filter set have provided us with images from which large samples of high  redshift galaxies can be derived .",
    "of particular interest are those galaxies with red enough @xmath50 colors to qualify as @xmath7dropouts  galaxies at redshifts @xmath51 , within 1 gyr of recombination .",
    "such objects have been the focus of a number of papers over the last year ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2003b , stanway et al .",
    "2003 , yan et al .",
    "2003 , dickinson et al .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation is beginning to appear ( e.g. , bunker et al .",
    "2003 , dickinson et al .",
    "2004 , stanway et al .",
    "2004 ) , but such observations are challenging , as weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) demonstrated with their @xmath52 object , which took over 7 hours of integration on keck .",
    "given the crucial and central role that hst plays in studies of high  redshift galaxies , it is worthwhile listing those fields that are playing a starring role in our collective efforts to push the frontiers on the properties of distant galaxies .",
    "in addition to the time - honored wfpc2 hdf  n and hdf  s fields , there are now several hst acs datasets with deep observations in multiple filters ( broadly @xmath53 ) . for the highest redshift galaxies the key filters are the two that are new on hst , the acs @xmath7 and @xmath8 filters , which are perfect for detecting @xmath10 galaxies , i.e. , @xmath7dropouts .",
    "the new acs fields are the great observatories origins deep fields ( goods ) cdf  s and hdf ",
    "n , the hubble ultra - deep field ( udf ) , and the two udf  parallel fields udf  ps ( which are deeper than the original hdfs ) .",
    "most of the udf has also been imaged with nicmos in @xmath54 and @xmath55 , giving a very deep dataset that complements the acs optical filter data .",
    "the udf data is deep , with a @xmath56 limiting magnitude of @xmath57 ab mag in @xmath58 and @xmath59ab mag in @xmath60 in the udf ",
    "the breadth of studies on high redshift galaxies can be exemplified by noting some of the questions which are actively being addressed in current observational programs :    @xmath61 when did the first galaxies begin to grow ( at @xmath62 , by @xmath63 ? )    @xmath61 when were the first giant es assembled ?",
    "@xmath61 what are the sub - mm ( scuba ) galaxies ?  and are they an important contributor to the mass density ?",
    "@xmath61 are we missing a significant fraction of assembling galaxies ( dusty reddened objects  a key area for spitzer ) ?",

    "are our dust estimates right ?",
    "@xmath61 how / when do disks form  and how common are large disks at @xmath64 or even 2 + ?",
    "what is the role of bars in evolution at high redshift ?",
    "@xmath61 what is the mass assembly history ?",
    "we see light , but what really counts is mass ( and that is really important for the connection to theory ) .",

    "the capabilities of the current generation of large ground - based telescopes ( like keck , the vlt , gemini and magellan ) , combined with the great observatories ( hst , chandra , spitzer ) have led to the initiation of numerous studies of the intermediate  to  high  redshift universe . on ",
    "going examples , which were discussed at this workshop , are the virmos , deep , gems , cosmos and goods surveys",
    ". they will provide great insight into the nature of the universe at @xmath65 .",
    "complementary to these studies of field galaxies are programs on clusters like that described by at this meeting by holland ford .",
    "this acs gto team program focuses on rich clusters of galaxies out to @xmath41 , with an extension to protoclusters at high  redshift , as described by george miley .",
    "a key part of these surveys is the characterization of galaxies at intermediate redshift through kinematical measures ( velocity dispersion and rotation curves ) of very large samples , as described by david koo for example , for the deep survey .",
    "a number of groups are focusing on deriving fundamental plane parameters for both field and cluster galaxies out to @xmath41 , and beyond .",
    "a subject of great interest is understanding the nature of the powerful sub  mm sources ( e.g. , scuba sources ) and establishing their redshifts and properties .",
    "considerable progress is occurring in this area , but truly astonishing gains will come about when alma comes on line .",
    "lirgs and ulirgs at high redshift will continue to be the focus of considerable effort in the future .",
    "the nature of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath66 is starting to become clearer , as ir and kinematical data begin to establish their stellar and dynamical masses .",
    "many important studies are continuing on these sources .",
    "a related activity is assessing the properties of galaxies in the redshift `` desert '' at @xmath67 .",
    "recent results , for both star  forming and evolved galaxies in this redshift range , will prove to be very valuable in finally establishing the star formation history of the universe across the full redshift range .    these studies , and others , will benefit from major new datasets , particularly from spitzer ( e.g. , the gto programs , and legacy surveys like goods ) and hst deep fields ( like the goods cdf  s and hdf ",
    "n , udf , udf ",
    "ps , and udf  ir from nicmos ) , combined with chandra data , and with ground  based spectra from 8-m class telescopes ( and then from alma ) .",
    "spitzer , in particular , will provide a valuable addition to the photometry ( optical and ir ) now available for large samples of galaxies , extending the wavelength baseline by a factor of 10 or more , thereby improving our leverage to constrain the stellar mass .",
    "the ir data will largely free us from the tyranny of uncertain m / ls that abound in purely optical ( rest  frame uv ) studies of star  forming ( or recently star  forming ) galaxies .",
    "some initial studies demonstrated the value of measuring the stellar mass buildup history of galaxies ( e.g. , dickinson et al .",
    "galaxy stellar masses have also recently been derived from early spitzer irac observations ( barmby et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "it is clear that a vast number of surveys and studies are under way , in a broad area , and it is impractical to give more than a superficial overview of them in this review .",
    "instead we will concentrate on developments in three areas at the forefront .",
    "these all involve very recent developments on galaxies at @xmath68 .",
    "they include , in addition to the stellar masses derived from optical and near - ir rest - frame seds mentioned above , the dynamical masses from kinematical observations of @xmath68 lbg galaxies ( e.g. , erb et al .  2003 , erb et al .  2004 , genzel et al .",

    "( 2003 ) and van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) ; and the very high redshift samples of lbgs , the dropout samples at @xmath10 , and beyond from hst acs ( and nicmos for the @xmath69 galaxies ) , e.g. , as discussed by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , stanway et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and yan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the current frontier for high redshift objects is at @xmath10 ( the acs udf and nicmos udf ",
    "ir images together have extended the dropout sources to redshifts 7 and beyond , but the samples are small ) .",
    "rapid changes in the properties of high redshift galaxies must occur beyond @xmath6 and so careful characterization of objects , even those separated by small intervals of time , is an important aspect of the study of @xmath70 galaxies .",
    "there is great value in having large samples of @xmath71 objects to contrast with the @xmath6 galaxies .",
    "though only @xmath72 gyr later in cosmic history , @xmath71 galaxies are larger and much better characterized than @xmath6 galaxies , providing key baseline information needed to evaluate evolutionary changes with redshift .",
    "star formation is a continuing challenge for galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "the physics is complex , and not well constrained by the observational evidence .",
    "there has been significant progress in the parameterization of the key steps in the models .",
    "however , enough discrepancies exist between the model ( semi  analytic or hydro code ) predictions of light and the observed photometric properties of galaxies that it behooves the observational astronomers to do all they can to measure mass scales for galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "the more direct coupling with theory will be a key step in understanding the buildup of galaxies .",
    "fortunately , a number of observational programs are beginning to give greater insight into the mass scales of galaxies at key epochs .",
    "it is important to distinguish direct dynamical measures of mass from those that rely on sed fits and assumptions about the imf to derive `` stellar '' masses .",
    "both approaches have value , but significant assumptions go into the latter , which may not be valid in all cases or at all stages of the buildup of a galaxy ( the imf may change with time in star  forming regions ) . the challenges of actually measuring gas or stellar kinematics in high  redshift galaxies means that the derivation of stellar masses from seds is more widely used at this time .",
    "but both techniques provide valuable insights and are becoming increasingly common ( see , e.g. , rudnick et al .",

    "2004 ) .    for sed ",
    "fit stellar masses of high  redshift galaxies , most results have relied on rest ",
    "frame uv  optical observations , and were therefore subject to sizable uncertainties due to the effect on star formation on the measured @xmath73 ratios .",
    "this approach was nonetheless a valuable first step , and demonstrated the value of deriving the evolution of the global stellar mass density from @xmath74 , i.e. , deriving the the mass buildup history of the universe .",
    "for example , dickinson et al .  ( 2003 ) used the hdf ",
    "n data , from the wfpc2 @xmath75 to the nicmos @xmath76band ir data down to 26.5 mag ( ab ) , determined photometric redshifts and rest - frame @xmath77 mag for a wide range of redshifts , and then derived stellar masses .    this approach to deriving stellar masses will mature as data from spitzer become available for large samples .",
    "the irac data from spitzer , with its simultaneous 5.12 x 5.12 arcmin images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8@xmath27 m , will allow fluxes of high redshift galaxies like lbgs to be determined at rest ",
    "frame near  ir ( @xmath78 m ) .",
    "this will greatly reduce concerns about the uncertain @xmath73  since the recent star formation history will have significantly lower influence on the flux at @xmath79 m . as noted above",
    ", the first such results are beginning to appear from the spitzer irac gto team .",
    "barmby et al .",
    "( 2004 ) carried out sed fits for spitzer irac observations of lbgs .",
    "these were combined with optical data and bruzual and charlot ( 2003 ) models to estimate stellar masses . since the spitzer irac data corresponded to rest ",
    "frame @xmath80@xmath27 m there is greater confidence in the derived `` stellar masses '' than those derived just from the optical ( though , reassuringly , the spitzer irac results are consistent with the earlier rest  frame optical results , e.g. , papovich et al .",
    "interestingly , the typical stellar galaxy masses were found to be about @xmath81 @xmath4  characteristic of current  day massive bulges .",
    "while much will be done over the coming years using seds from spitzer the most valuable observations will be direct dynamical measures of mass from kinematic observations .",
    "these have the potential to allow direct comparison of the mass scales of galaxies at different redshifts with the very large body of data that is now available at @xmath17 .",
    "a recent paper by genzel et al .  ( 2003 ) exemplifies the power of sub  mm observations , a field which will grow dramatically when alma comes on line .",
    "iram interferometer observations were made of the scuba source smm j023990136 at @xmath82 in the co ( 32 ) line .",
    "this object is extended in a keck image .",
    "the sub  mm velocity  position diagram showed a structure characteristic of a rotating disk .",
    "the `` two  peaked ''",
    "line profile looked much like those seen in disk galaxies at low redshift from hi radio observations .",
    "what was particularly striking about this object was the magnitude of the rotation : @xmath83 km s@xmath14 implying a mass of some @xmath84 @xmath4 within @xmath85 kpc at @xmath82 ! this is a strikingly massive galaxy .",
    "while challenging at this time , such observations should be routine with alma .",
    "the recent advent of efficient long  slit ir spectrographs on large telescopes is also providing opportunities for studies of the kinematic motions in high  redshift galaxies . using emission lines in high  redshift lbgs to derive velocities for the gas has long been a goal , but the large outflows in these strongly star  forming objects ( first seen in the spectra obtained of the strongly ",
    "lensed @xmath86 galaxy g1 in the @xmath87 cluster cl1358 + 62  see franx et al .",
    "1997 ) has limited the value of any measures derived from uv lines like ly@xmath1 .",
    "fortunately the optical nebular lines like h@xmath88 and [ nii ] provide velocities that are likely to be more representative of the dynamically  induced velocity field in the galaxy . but these fall in the near  ir at @xmath89 m for @xmath90 galaxies and so require near  ir spectroscopy . as noted above this is now possible with isaac on the vlt and nirspec on keck , for example , and allows the measurement of velocities to give dynamical mass estimates .",
    "a key paper in this area was that of erb et al .",
    "they took h@xmath1 observations of 16 @xmath91 lbg galaxies with keck nirspec and vlt isaac .",
    "they derived `` rotation '' curves for a sample of objects that were extended along the spectrograph slit .",
    "no particular effort was made in these observations to put the slits along the long axes of the objects ( it is not clear , however , in these high  redshift star forming objects that the `` long axis '' of the light distribution corresponds to the major axis of the mass distribution , since the star forming regions may be scattered about the galaxy in a quite non  uniform way ) .",
    "nonetheless they found that the emission lines were extended and tilted , characteristic of those seen in rotating galaxies .",
    "they derived `` rotation velocities '' , as well as velocity dispersions from the widths of the h@xmath1 line . to derive masses they needed a characteristic radius , and used the mean half ",
    "light radius that was determined for a subset of the sample for which hst images were available . the half ",
    "light radius was about 0.2 arcsec , corresponding to @xmath301.6 kpc at the redshift of this sample ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "while the effect of outflows on the measured kinematics remains to be determined , it is expected that the optical nebular lines will be much less affected than the uv lines like ly@xmath1 .",
    "ultimately one will need high s / n spectra to compare the emission line velocities with the interstellar and photospheric absorption line velocities as a check on the outflow contribution to the emission lines .",
    "the current kinematical data give typical masses of a @xmath93 @xmath4 .",
    "this is strikingly similar to the stellar masses estimated by barmby et al .",
    "( 2004 ) from spitzer sed fits !",
    "this work is being continued with further results given by erb et al .",
    "one of the most striking developments in the last two years in the field of high  redshift galaxies has been the discovery of an evolved population of galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "these objects were detected from very deep near  ir @xmath94 imaging in the hdf  s and in a well  studied distant cluster field , ms105403 .",
    "their seds suggested that they were relatively unreddened , evolved galaxies at high redshift ( franx et al .",
    "their seds were best fit with early  type populations .",
    "galaxies with evolved stellar seds that are red in @xmath23 ( @xmath95 ) were considered likely , from models , to have redshifts around @xmath2 . an initial spectroscopic study ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2003 ) supported these inferences .",
    "these first papers suggested that these objects are likely to be progenitors of current  day early  type galaxies .",
    "these objects are now being characterized with increasing detail ( see , e.g. , forster schreiber et al .  2004 ) .",
    "a recent development has been to use velocity measurements ( line widths ) to establish their mass scales .",
    "this was done with near  ir spectroscopy again , using nirspec on keck to measure the width of h@xmath88 in four of these objects ( van dokkum et al .",
    "the isaac vlt images of the galaxies with line widths showed that they are resolved with characteristic sizes @xmath96 arcsec .",
    "given measured velocity dispersions and a length scale , a characteristic mass could be determined .",
    "it was found to be high , @xmath97 @xmath4 , some @xmath98 that of the lbg galaxies .",
    "these @xmath23 galaxies ( or drgs  distant red galaxies ) are larger , redder and more massive than lbgs . strikingly , they are massive even compared to present day samples of early  type galaxies .",
    "a comparison of the 7 drgs with measured velocity dispersions ( and hence masses ) with @xmath3020,000 local sdss ellipticals shows that they fall at the high end of the sdss distribution ( which extends to about @xmath99 @xmath4 ) .",
