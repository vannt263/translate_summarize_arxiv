    "the enumeration of tilings of a centro - symmetric polygon by rhombi is a notoriously difficult problem that concerns discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science , as well as theoretical physics , in relation with quasicrystallography . in the latter community",
    ", these tilings are usually called `` random tilings with octagonal symmetry '' .",
    "we address the following issue : given a centro - symmetric octagon @xmath0 , of integral sides lengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( read clockwise ; see figure  [ pavgrid ] , left ) , in how many ways is it possible to fill it entirely , without any gap or overlap , with the following six species of tiles : two differently oriented squares , and four differently oriented 45@xmath3 rhombi , the six of them with unitary side lengths ?",
    "so far , this question has been solved in very particular instances only .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the set of all the tilings of @xmath0 , and by @xmath5 the cardinality of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , figure  [ 8octos ] displays the eight tilings of the set @xmath6 .",
    "small systems have been studied in references  @xcite up to sizes of some hundred tiles ( see table  [ enum ] ) .",
    "however , the technique employed can not reasonably provide tiling enumerations for bigger octagons .",

    "@xcite two formulas when two sides of the octagon are set to 1 : @xmath7 and @xmath8 the first formula has been later partially simplified  @xcite : @xmath9 \\label{francis}\\ ] ] where the last sum can be written in terms of a hypergeometric function @xmath10.\\ ] ]    we propose a generalization of the first formula  ( [ elnit1 ] ) to any side lengths , where @xmath11 is written as a sum of products of determinants . even if the complexity of our formula increases with the system size , it is the first explicit algebraic expression to count tilings of an octagon ( see eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) ) , which can be in principle calculated for any system size .    as it is discussed below into detail ,",
    "elnitsky s proof uses a `` square grid representation '' of tilings ( see figure  [ pavgrid ] ) , which is closely related to the `` de bruijn dualization '' , a wide - spread technique in quasicrystal science .",
    "this dualization has proved powerful to handle rhombus tilings in several circumstances .",
    "the present paper also uses this technique , thus generalizing elnitsky s proof .",
    "we now state our main result .",
    "given the side lengths @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath2 , we denote by @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) the set of families of integers @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , satisfying the relations : @xmath21 note that conditions ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) are not exactly similar . in the following , these integers will be the coordinates of the white disks in the grid representation ( see figure  [ pavgrid ] , right , and section [ octogrid ] ) .",
    "in addition , we set by convention for @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath22 the reasons for this convention will be explicited below .",
    "for any two such sequences @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we define the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 as follows : @xmath25 is a @xmath27 matrix of coefficients @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath26 is a @xmath30 matrix of coefficients @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "note that , by convention , we set @xmath33 whenever @xmath34 or @xmath35 or @xmath36 .    [ th1 ] with the previous notations ,",
    "the number of rhombus tilings of a centro - symmetric octagon of sides @xmath37 reads : @xmath38    it is demonstrated below that the determinants come from the enumeration , by the gessel - viennot method ( presented below ) , of tilings of independent sub - domains of the octagon delimited by some points of coordinates @xmath39 in the square grid representation .    when @xmath40 , the previous expression is reduced to elsnitsky s relation  ( [ elnit1 ] ) .",
    "note that by contrast , relation  ( [ elnit2 ] ) is _ not _ a spacial case of this formula . beyond this simple case , the number of terms in the formula grows with the octagon size .",
    "for example , for @xmath41 , the formula contains @xmath42 terms to count the 480 tilings . for @xmath43 , there are @xmath44 terms and 5383 tilings .",
    "more generally , the number of terms grows exponentially with the number of tiles , but it nevertheless grows exponentially more slowly than the number of tilings . as a consequence ,",
    "this formula is exponentially more compact than the crude enumeration of tilings .",
    "this point is discussed in the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we show that octagonal tilings are conveniently represented by families of directed paths running on a rectangular patch of square grid .",
    "this representation was used by elnitsky @xcite and it is reminiscent of the prior `` de bruijn dualization ''  @xcite and derived representations  @xcite . we first expose briefly the de bruijn dualization process .",
    "figures  [ pavgrid ] and  [ bd1 ] will help the reader . to begin with , we notice that tile edges can have four possible orientations .",
    "we define a _ family of de bruijn lines _ for each orientation : de bruijn lines are made up of adjacent rhombi sharing an edge with this orientation .",
    "it is always possible to extend these lines through the whole tiling up to a boundary tile .",
    "two examples of lines are presented in both figures  [ pavgrid ] and [ bd1 ] , belonging to two different families .",
    "a rhombic tile is situated at the intersection of two lines of different families ( see the figures ) . by construction ,",
    "lines of a same family never intersect ; there are respectively @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath2 lines in each family .",
    "now we show how to translate the de bruijn s representation of a tiling into its square grid representation . in figure",
    "[ bd1 ] , we show this correspondence in the simplest case @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to shrink the de bruijn lines of two families among four , so that they become paths on a square grid , as displayed in figures  [ pavgrid ] or [ bd1 ] .",
    "because all tiles of a de bruijn line have an edge of a given orientation , these paths are directed .",
    "the @xmath13 paths of the first family ( denoted by @xmath45 ) go from the south - west corner to the north - east one ( dark gray ) ; they can follow eastward and northward edges only ; the @xmath2 paths of the second family ( denoted by @xmath46 ) go from the north - west corner to the south - east one ( light gray ) ; they can follow eastward and southward edges only .       in the simplest case @xmath40 , to avoid ambiguity due to path tangency and to make this correspondence bijective  @xcite",
    ", we keep track of the intersection of the de bruijn lines thanks to a _ distinguished vertex _ , represented by a white disk in the right figure .",
    "it marks the position of the unique tilted square ( medium gray ) . when @xmath47 or @xmath48 as in figure  [ pavgrid ] , there are @xmath49 intersections and therefore @xmath49 tilted squares .",
    "each of them must be located by a distinguished vertex on the square grid .",
    "paths do not cross in a same family even though _ they can be locally adjacent _",
    "( see figure  [ pavgrid ] ) .",
    "we denote the paths of @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) by @xmath50 ( resp .",
    "@xmath51 ) from left to right . as a consequence ,",
    "distinguished vertices are indexed by two integers @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and are denoted by @xmath54 ( see figure  [ patches ] ) .",
    "the gessel - viennot method  @xcite is a combinatorial technique for the counting of configurations of directed non - intersecting paths on oriented graphs .",
    "this technique has already proved very useful for the enumeration of rhombus tilings ( see @xcite for examples , as well as section  [ proofth1 ] of the present paper ) .",
    "it has been extensively described in the literature  @xcite and we shall only briefly explain it in the present paper , focusing on the underlying ideas and not on technical details .",
    "the method is rather general and can be applied to any acyclic oriented graph @xmath55 , in which are selected two families of vertices , @xmath56 ( `` departure '' vertices ) and @xmath57 ( `` arrival '' vertices ) , @xmath58 .",
    "we consider directed paths , running on @xmath55 , starting from one vertex @xmath56 and arriving at one vertex @xmath57 . by",
    "`` directed '' , we naturally mean that the paths must follow the edge orientations .",
    "in addition , this graph is supposed to satisfy the property of _ compatibility _ : if two directed paths on @xmath55 are going respectively from @xmath59 to @xmath60 and from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , if these paths do not cross , and if @xmath63 then @xmath64 .",
    "this property is very specific to two - dimensional graphs .",
    "we are interested in the number @xmath65 of configurations of @xmath66 non - intersecting directed paths on @xmath55 , where the @xmath67-th path goes from @xmath56 to @xmath68 : two paths are said to be non - intersecting if they share no vertex ; @xmath66 paths are said to be non - intersecting if any two paths are non - intersecting . if we denote by @xmath69 the number of paths going from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , then the gessel - viennot theorem states that @xmath70    the idea of the proof is that in this determinant , all configurations of @xmath66 paths , whether intersecting or not , the @xmath67-th path going from @xmath56 to @xmath71 , for any permutation @xmath72 , are counted , with a @xmath73 or @xmath74 sign . because of these signs , all configurations with one or more intersections cancel two by two .",
    "only the non - intersecting configurations remain .",
    "they are exactly the configurations under interest thanks to the property of compatibility .",
    "the interested reader is referred to stembridge  @xcite for more detailed explanations .",
    "we are now ready to prove theorem  [ th1 ] .",
    "first of all , we need to endow the square grid with integer coordinates in order to locate the positions of distinguished vertices .",
    "they are defined according to the usual conventions , so that the south - west and north - east corners have respective coordinates @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the coordinates of @xmath54 are denoted by @xmath39 . by extension",
    ", we also define the vertices @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "they are the ends of paths of families @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if their coordinates are also denoted by @xmath39 , these last definitions are compatible with the conventions  ( [ conventions ] ) given in introduction .",
    "all these coordinates naturally obey relations  ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , because of the directed character of de bruijn lines , distinguished vertices @xmath54 are constrained by some conditions when they belong to the same paths , and they must obey relations  ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) as well .",
    "these four conditions define the sets @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as it was stated in the introductory part .",
    "let @xmath81 and @xmath82 be an admissible set of coordinates of the distinguished vertices .",
    "we denote by @xmath83 the subset of tilings of @xmath4 in the square grid representations of which the distinguished vertices have these coordinates .",
    "the subsets @xmath83 are two - by - two disjoint so that @xmath84 .",
    "our purpose is now to calculate each @xmath85 .",
    "this calculation is feasible because for a given @xmath86 , the subset @xmath83 can be factorized into simple sets ( see eq .",
    "( [ factorization ] ) ) .",
    "each of them can in turn be counted by the gessel - viennot method , which leads to relation  ( [ w ] ) .",
    "first we need to introduce two definitions . given a configuration of vertices @xmath87 , we fix @xmath53 and we consider in isolation the vertices @xmath88 as well as @xmath54 , @xmath19 ( see figures  [ patches ] and [ recomposition ] ) .",
    "then we define the set @xmath89 of _ all _ the configurations of @xmath13 directed non - crossing paths , the @xmath52-th path going from @xmath88 to @xmath54 , with @xmath19 .",
    "these paths are directed from south - west to north - east .",
    "they have no constraint except that they are directed and non - crossing ( these paths can have tangencies ) . in a similar way",
    ", we define the sets @xmath90 for any @xmath52 : they are the sets of all configurations of @xmath2 directed non - crossing paths , going from north - west to south - east .",
    "the @xmath53-th path goes from @xmath91 to @xmath54 .    now in order to prove theorem  [ th1 ] , we start from the following observation , illustrated in figure  [ patches ] : in @xmath83 the distinguished vertices @xmath54 are held fixed and one can consider _ independent _ patches of the families @xmath45 or @xmath46 , as follows . without loss of generality , we focus on @xmath45 .",
    "we cut each path @xmath92 into @xmath93 sections , denoted by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "the section @xmath94 goes from @xmath88 to @xmath54 .",
    "then all the @xmath13 sections @xmath94 , @xmath19 form a local path configuration denoted by @xmath96 .",
    "it belongs to @xmath89 . in a similar way ,",
    "the corresponding grid patches defined with respect to the family @xmath46 are denoted by @xmath97 and belong to @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath98 and @xmath99 are fixed , we have the natural inclusion @xmath100 where the products are direct .",
    "we prove below that    [ lemme1 ] the previous inclusion is an equality : @xmath101    it follows from eq .",
    "( [ factorization ] ) that @xmath102 and that @xmath103 the remainder of the proof consists in calculating the cardinalities @xmath104 and @xmath105 by the gessel - viennot method .",
    "indeed , it is also demonstrated below that    [ lemme2 ] when @xmath98 and @xmath99 are fixed , @xmath106      we need to prove the reverse inclusion @xmath107 configurations from the sets @xmath108 provide sections of paths from @xmath88 to @xmath54 . when concatenated , these sections provide complete directed non - crossing paths from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , which form a family @xmath45 . in a similar way ,",
    "sections from the @xmath109 provide directed non - crossing paths from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , forming a family @xmath46 .",
    "we only need to check that any two paths from @xmath45 and @xmath46 only cross at the distinguished vertices @xmath54 .",
    "this point is ensured by the directed character of path sections ( see figure  [ recomposition ] ) .",
    "this last observation is crucial and all the demonstration relies on it : it ensures the reverse inclusion and therefore the direct character of the product  ( [ factorization ] ) , from which our enumerating formula ensues .",
    "so far we have used the terminologies `` non-_intersecting _ paths '' in section  [ gv ] and `` non-_crossing _ paths '' in section  [ proofth1 ] .",
    "now it is time to precise what aspects these two terms cover .",
    "we have seen that non - crossing paths can have tangencies , that is to say they can share vertices or edges of the grid , but they can not step over one another . in particular , non - crossing paths of families @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) share their ends , but can be indexed from west to east without ambiguity .    on the contrary ,",
    "non - intersecting paths can not share any vertex or edge .",
    "therefore , if we want to use the gessel - viennot method , we need to transform configurations of non - crossing paths on the square grid into configurations of non - intersecting paths .",
    "the trick consists in shifting non - crossing paths , as it is illustrated in figure  [ shift ] .",
    "the trick is standard and was already used by elnitsky @xcite for example .",
    "we use a unitary shift vector @xmath112 and we shift the @xmath52-th path section @xmath94 by a vector @xmath113 ( see the figure ) .",
    "the new paths still belong to the square grid .",
    "the @xmath52-th new path section goes from the new vertex @xmath114 to the new vertex @xmath115 , of coordinates @xmath116 the so - obtained path configuration is non - intersecting by construction .",
    "this correspondence between configurations of non - crossing paths and configurations of non - intersecting paths is bijective .",
    "now we use the gessel - viennot technique by setting the departure vertices @xmath117 and the arrival ones @xmath118 .",
    "the number of directed paths on the square grid going from a vertex @xmath119 to a vertex @xmath120 is simply given by the binomial coefficient @xmath121 then one computes the coefficients @xmath69 involved in the gessel - viennot method : @xmath122 .",
    "thus one obtains the matrices @xmath25 , the determinants of which count the elements of @xmath108 . in the same way , to count the elements of the sets @xmath109 , one must shift the sections of paths @xmath123 by @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "one gets the matrices @xmath26 and takes their determinant , which completes the proof of lemma  [ lemme2 ] .",
    "we have demonstrated how elnitsky s technique can be generalized to octagons of any size , leading to an explicit enumerative formula ( theorem  [ th1 ] ) .",
    "we also notice that the conditions  ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c1 ] ) ( resp .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) ) that define the set @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) are identical to the conditions defining plane partitions of height @xmath12 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) on a @xmath126 grid  @xcite .",
    "this point is remarkable because such plane partitions are known to be equivalent to rhombus tilings filling a centro - symmetric _ hexagon _ of sides lengths @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath12 )  @xcite .",
    "we have derived a partial combinatorial interpretation of our formula  ( [ w ] ) in terms of these tilings of hexagons .",
    "it is related to a natural decomposition of the configuration sets of tilings of octagons , as described in ref .",
    "but it goes beyond the scope of the present paper and will be described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath127 denotes the number of tilings of the centro - symmetric hexagon of sides @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the previous remark leads to the lower bound @xmath128 the number of terms the formula . by construction , the sets @xmath90 and @xmath89 are not empty and all terms are positive . in statistical physics and",
    "more specifically in quasicrystal science , people are interested in thermodynamic quantities such as the configurational entropy ( per tile ) : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the number of tiles . with our polygonal boundary conditions ,",
    "this quantity has a finite limit when @xmath130 goes to infinity provided the relative ratios of the side lengths also have a finite limit  @xcite .",
    "in the so - called `` diagonal '' case where all side lengths are equal , taking into account the number of tiles , the previous relation becomes @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "the actual value of @xmath132 is numerically known to be close to 0.36  @xcite .",
    "the previous lower bound is manifestly loose and its improvement requires a better knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of the determinants in  ( [ w ] ) at the large size limit .",
    "but the main advantage of our formula precisely lies on the fact that the previous bound is weak : the formula realizes an exponential reduction of the number of terms as compared to a crude enumeration of tilings .",
    "indeed , as it was just discussed in the previous paragraph , the number of terms grows exponentially like @xmath133 where s the number of tilings grows like @xmath134 . even if in practice we can not compute numerically the number of tilings of octagons bigger than in table  [ enum ] , the progress is already significant .",
    "moreover there exists some hope to simplify our formula , at least partially , as in eq .",
    "( [ francis ] ) .",
    "in addition , the formula brings a new insight into the structure of tiling sets : it emphasizes a natural decomposition of the sets into smaller disjoint subsets , the cardinality of which is simply given by evaluation of determinants .",
    "we are indebted to one of the referees for a careful reading of our manuscript and sound suggestions of improvements ."
