    "this is of course in perfect agreement with the fact that the direct coupling of the photon to the dibaryon  generated by gauging the dibaryon kinetic energy operators  only enters at in the eft counting .",

    "this means that compared to the simple one - nucleon - exchange diagram ( without a photon ) they are both suppressed by a factor @xmath88 .",
    "consistent with this one finds by direct numerical evaluation that they are 7% ( b ) and 15% effects ( c ) at the zero - momentum scattering threshold .",
    "we can summarize these findings by saying that unless a diagram directly exhibits the ( regulated ) coulomb pole , it is not enhanced and thus a small electromagnetic correction to the same diagram topology without coulomb - photon exchange .",
    "the enhanced coulomb contributions are particularly large in the threshold region ( where @xmath24 is very small ) and should thus be iterated to all orders . the calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite neglect both diagrams  ( b ) and  ( c ) as well as all diagrams involving more than one coulomb photon , giving them an _ a priori _ uncertainty of 715 percent . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scatteringrevisited ] , we will critically assess this approach .    to conclude the topic for the moment we point out again that the power counting discussed here",
    "is specifically designed to account for coulomb contributions that become strong in low - momentum scattering . at larger momenta , where the coulomb parameter @xmath89 becomes small , it would suffice to not iterate any coulomb diagrams but rather include them strictly perturbatively .",
    "however , exactly because they become small we assume that it also does not spoil the calculation to iterate them everywhere . as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : he3-nonpert ] , for calculations in the bound - state regime the counting definitely has to be modified because there all loop - momentum scales are set by the binding momentum of the bound state . based on the findings there , we will then argue in section  [ sec : scatteringrevisited ] that the same counting  which is actually simpler  should also be used in the scattering regime . for the moment , however , we proceed as in ref .",

    "<S> we provide a detailed discussion of the low - energy proton  deuteron system in pionless effective field theory , considering both the spin - quartet and doublet s - wave channels . extending and amending our previous work on the subject , we calculate the @xmath0he@xmath0h binding energy difference both perturbatively ( using properly normalized trinucleon wave functions ) and non - perturbatively by resumming all @xmath1 coulomb diagrams in the doublet channel . </S>",
    "<S> our nonperturbative result agrees well with a calculation that involves the full off - shell coulomb t - matrix . carefully examining the cutoff - dependence in the doublet channel </S>",
    "<S> , we present numerical evidence for a new three - nucleon counterterm being necessary at next - to - leading order if coulomb effects are included . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , such a term has recently been identified analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore make a case for a simplified coulomb power counting that is consistent throughout the bound - state and scattering regimes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , using a `` partially screened '' full off - shell coulomb t - matrix , we investigate the importance of higher - order coulomb corrections in low - energy quartet - channel scattering . </S>"
