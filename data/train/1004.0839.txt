    "the paramagnetic resonance is a well - known phenomenon resulting from the collective precession of the total magnetization about an external magnetic field . for spin systems with interactions of the standard su(2 )",
    "heisenberg form , the total magnetization is conserved and there is no relaxation of the magnetization , regardless of the strength of the interaction .",
    "it is no longer true when anisotropic interactions are present , and the magnetization relaxes with a characteristic time scale .",
    "a theoretical issue is to relate this time scale ( or the width of the resonance ) to the anisotropy strength in a many - body system . in strongly interacting systems ,",
    "small anisotropies ( as in transition metal compounds ) lead to an exchange - narrowed lorentzian resonance.@xcite the linewidth is given , generically , by the theory of kubo - tomita,@xcite and cast into a more general formalism by mori@xcite and zwanzig.@xcite however , the markovian assumption used by kubo - tomita was later argued to break down in low dimensional systems .",
    "for one dimensional systems , deviations from the lorentzian lineshape were indeed observed experimentally and attributed to spin diffusion,@xcite which was not taken into account in the first place .",
    "recently , oshikawa and affleck@xcite have developed a direct approach in one - dimensional @xmath0 systems , based on an effective field - theory , which is valid at low temperatures and could account successfully for the ( low-)temperature dependence of the measured linewidths .",
    "it is , however , clear that a theory of the high - temperature linewidth would be very useful to extract the anisotropies experimentally .",
    "the kubo - tomita formula has been widely used in this regime but not thoroughly tested .",
    "it is nonetheless known that , even in the high - temperature regime , a direct application of the kubo - tomita formula fails in the case of dzyaloshinskii - moriya anisotropy in one dimension,@xcite which is first - order in the spin - orbit coupling in @xmath0 systems .",
    "it predicts indeed a linewidth varying like @xmath1 , which was originally argued to be responsible for the large linewidth observed in particular in cugeo@xmath2.@xcite it is in fact incompatible with a general argument in one dimension , which leads to predict a smaller @xmath3.@xcite it is then of the same order of magnitude as the contribution of the exchange anisotropy ( as also happens for other observables@xcite ) , _ i.e. _ fourth - order in the spin - orbit coupling and , hence , small . as alternatives ,",
    "unconventionnal superexchange@xcite or dynamical dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions@xcite were invoked to explain the strong broadening .",
    "nonetheless , it is expected , on general grounds , that one - dimensional systems may possess an inherent strong broadening because of spin - diffusion at high temperatures .",
    "one issue is to obtain a reliable quantitative estimation of the effect .",
    "approximations , such as the random phase approximation ( rpa),@xcite perturbative expansions,@xcite or self - consistent rpa,@xcite suggested in particular departures from the lorentzian lineshape , but it is difficult to judge how quantitative these theories are .    in contrast , in two spatial dimensions , it is surprising to notice ( empirically ) that applying the kubo - tomita s formula seems to give rather accurate results at high temperatures .",
    "for instance , in the shastry - sutherland compound , srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath2)@xmath4 , this gives an out - of - plane dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xmath5 k,@xcite while neutron scattering gives 2.1 k.@xcite    in the following , we will give a quantitative estimation of the linewidth in one and two dimensions and the corresponding lineshapes .",
    "we predict an enhancement of the linewidth with respect to the perturbative kubo - tomita formula , particularly strong when the diffusive motion is assumed at long times . moreover , while we agree that the linewidth induced by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya anisotropy or the exchange anisotropy are of the same order in one dimension ( or more generally for the _ _ reducible__@xcite dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions ) , we claim that , in two dimensions , the _ irreducible _ dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions lead to a linewidth essentially varying like @xmath1 , _",
    "i.e. _ like in kubo - tomita , with a prefactor that we shall estimate .",
    "an approach consists of exact numerical diagonalizations of the hamiltonian and a calculation of the dynamics using the kubo formula.@xcite the approach is interesting not only because there is no approximation made but also because it provides information on the whole esr spectrum and tells us whether there are more resonances than the paramagnetic resonance .",
    "it is of course limited by the system size and especially at finite temperatures where one needs to calculate all eigenstates .",
    "as we shall see , a direct computation of the kubo formula gives results which are difficult to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit . since , however , the calculation is exact for small sizes , the prediction for the lineshape may be interesting for molecular magnets , in particular to disentangle different mechanisms .",
    "however , to obtain information for bulk systems , we suggest that it is more interesting to calculate the memory function by exact diagonalization , in the mori - zwanzig framework .",
    "while the calculation of the memory function is exact only at short - times for finite - size systems , its validity goes beyond the perturbative short - time expansion developed earlier.@xcite we find a clear slowing down of the memory function compared to kubo - tomita in one dimension ( but not in two dimensions ) , possibly indicative of a crossover to spin diffusion .",
    "we can then test the spin diffusion assumption for the long - time behaviour .",
    "it is indeed reasonable to assume that the short - time behaviour depends on the microscopic details of the lattice ( and hence needs a precise calculation ) while the long - time may be more universal ( and depends primarily on the spatial dimension ) .",
    "this allows to obtain a quantitative idea of how accurate the kubo - tomita s result is in one and two dimensions .",

    "we restrict ourselves to an external field @xmath33 along @xmath24 . in this case , the @xmath24-component of the total magnetization , @xmath34 , is conserved and the magnetic field splits the excited states according to @xmath35 but does not change the matrix elements in eq .",

    "in addition , the operator @xmath36 changes @xmath34 by @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 is shifted by @xmath39 .",
    "as soon as @xmath33 is larger than the linewidth , the @xmath40 lineshape is the same as for @xmath41 shifted by @xmath39 .",
    "the result of the calculation of the kubo formula ( [ matrixelement ] ) for @xmath42 spins interacting with the hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ sxx ] ( the delta peaks in ( [ matrixelement ] ) are slightly broadened by a gaussian form@xcite ) .",
    "we find a broad resonance centered at the magnetic field @xmath33 ( there is no finite shift ) .",
    "since we are at high temperatures , we stress that @xmath17 is the same around @xmath43 . the calculation being exact ,",
    "this is the lineshape we predict for molecular magnets of the ring geometry , at high temperature , would the mechanism giving the linewidth be purely magnetic in origin . in fig .",
    "[ sxx ] , the different curves correspond to different strengths of dzyaloshinskii - moriya coupling .",
    "they are normalized in intensity and rescaled in frequency using the linewidth , noted @xmath44 , and defined as the half - width at half - maximum of the full line .",
    "they all collapse onto a single ( quasi)-universal lineshape with a double - peak structure , in a wide range of anisotropy strengths , @xmath45 and sizes .",
    "if we consider the special case @xmath41 , the double - peak structure can be seen as a pseudo - gap .",
    "the prediction of this lineshape seems at odds with the conventional exchange - narrowing theory which , in general , predicts a single lorentzian .",
    "we will discuss the origin of these differences below .",
    "in addition to the double - peak structure , there is an additional weight in the wing .",
    "in fact , the line - shape can be fitted by four lorentzians , two centered at @xmath46 and two at @xmath47 ( each component is given by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ sxx ] and the fit by a solid thick line ) .",
    "the linewidth @xmath44 increases basically like @xmath48 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ sxx ] ) with a rather small prefactor , @xmath49 .",
    "the prefactor is size - dependent and is difficult to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for this reason ( and following the discussion of section [ ktmz ] ) , the special double - peak line - shape may or may not survive in the thermodynamic limit . for molecular rings , this should be relevant and the prefactor is found to be @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we now emphasize the difference between the dzyaloshinskii - moriya model and the xxz model , as far as the response is concerned . in fig .",
    "[ background ] , we show the resonance line in absolute values for the two models with coupling strengths related by the mapping @xmath55 .",
    "the two resonance lines are undistinguishable at low energies ( inset of fig .  [ background ] ) but differ at high energy in the background ( fig .  [ background ] ) .",
    "the difference comes from the small oscillating staggered field ( or umklapp contribution from the spin fluctuations at @xmath56 ) that the mapping induces,@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 correspond to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya and xxz model , respectively , and @xmath60 is the @xmath56 response .",
    "the second term gives extra `` forbidden '' resonances ( or `` satellite '' lines ) at low temperatures.@xcite these resonances have disappeared at high temperatures . instead , this contribution gives a broad background , covering the whole energy range .",
    "this is the origin of the difference of the two curves at high energy . to summarize , the resonance lineshape as shown in fig .",
    "[ sxx ] is the same for both the dzyaloshinskii - moriya and the xxz models as long as we use the correspondence @xmath55 ( and not too small intensities ) .",
    "note that we have found deviations about the universality of the low - energy lineshape at strong anisotropies ( either dzyaloshinskii - moriya or xxz ) .",
    "this is expected because , for @xmath61 , the model is xy and the lineshape is known to be exactly gaussian.@xcite we have recovered this result numerically : we have found no difference with a gaussian at @xmath61 ( no finite - size effects ) .",
    "the way it crossovers from a gaussian function to four lorentzians ( by reducing @xmath62 from 1 ) is to depress the response at @xmath63 and let side peaks appear , which decrease in height .",
    "it is therefore clear that in the range of strong anisotropies , the lineshape is not universal at all .",
    "we now discuss the kubo - tomita theory , in order to understand why the lineshape is not a single lorentzian in such finite - size systems and go beyond the limitations imposed by finite - size calculations .",
    "a way to clarify the assumptions is to start with the more general mori - zwanzig formalism.@xcite in this framework , the spin fluctuations ( those that do not depend on time through the magnetization function ) are viewed as a random noise ( the bath ) that forces the magnetization to equilibrate .",
    "the system is then governed by a langevin equation , @xmath64 where the `` memory function '' ( or self - energy ) @xmath65 is related to the correlation function of the random force @xmath66 by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . however , neither @xmath65 nor @xmath66 are easily expressed in terms of the original spin hamiltonian because of unknown projection operators.@xcite it is only at second - order in perturbation theory ( here in the anisotropy),@xcite that @xmath65 is given by the total force correlation function @xmath67 where the total force ( or torque ) is given by @xmath68e^{-i{\\cal h}t}$ ] . since @xmath69 is linear in the anisotropy",
    ", @xmath65 is second - order , and perturbation theory holds for small anisotropies .",
    "( [ correlationfunction ] ) is precisely what kubo and tomita have obtained directly by perturbation theory .",
    "the second assumption is that @xmath70 is slow compared to the relaxation time of the force ( local equilibrium).@xcite it is true that the force @xmath71 is not conserved by the dynamics ( whereas @xmath70 is nearly conserved ) and evolves on a short time - scale of order @xmath72,@xcite but the absence of memory at long times is an assumption .",
    "if it is true ( the system is markovian ) , eq .",
    "( [ diffequation ] ) simply defines a relaxation time , @xmath73 ( or onsager s transport coefficient ) @xmath74 in this `` fast '' regime , the lineshape is therefore always lorentzian with half - width at half - maximum ( linewidth ) given by @xmath75 .",

    "the form of @xmath65 is therefore of importance and various assumptions have been used .",
    "the original ( third ) assumption of kubo - tomita was to use a gaussian decay for @xmath65 , based on the short - time evolution given by perturbation theory @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the moments , @xmath86 , @xmath87 f \\rangle$ ] , @xmath88 [ f,{\\cal h } ] \\rangle$ ] etc .. they can be calculated exactly at high temperatures . for the xxz model ( [ ham1 ] ) ,",

    "the result is different from the gaussian decay and there is a considerable slowing down for @xmath107 .",
    "we have here access to a regime that would be difficult to access by perturbation theory .",
    "we will come back on this non - perturbative regime in the next section . above @xmath108 ,",
    "finite - size effects dominate . in particular at longer times ( fig .",
    "[ sigmalongtime ] ) , @xmath65 acquires an additional broad peak at about @xmath109 .",

    "the crucial point is to obtain the memory function @xmath65 , but it can not be computed at any time @xmath119 by exact diagonalization .",
    "it is therefore interesting to assume a long - time behavior and test its consequences on the resonance line , which can then be compared to experiments . for this",
    ", we will interpolate between the exact result at short times ( up to the time where @xmath65 has converged for @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath121 in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] ) and the assumed hydrodynamic behavior at long times .",
    "first we note that the slowing down obtained in the non - perturbative regime ( @xmath122 ) already leads to increase the linewidth compared with kubo - tomita .",
    "if we assume for instance an abrupt cutoff at @xmath121 ( remember that for @xmath123 , @xmath65 is dominated by finite - size effects ) , eq .",

    "[ hwhm2d ] could be experimentally relevant ( because of interplane couplings , for instance ) . away from the kubo - tomita line ( lower bound in fig .  [ hwhm2d ] ) , we can see in fig .",
    "[ lineshapes2d ] that the lineshape starts to deviate from a lorentzian ( but less than in one dimension ) .",
    "we now apply this to the @xmath0 kagome compound zncu@xmath2(oh)@xmath162cl@xmath2.@xcite the analysis of the linewidth using the kubo - tomita formula provided @xmath163.@xcite if we assume that spin - diffusion takes place , the self - consistent calculation reproduces the same experimental linewidth providing @xmath164 ( see dashed line in fig .  [ hwhm2d ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to compare directly with the esr lineshape of zncu@xmath2(oh)@xmath162cl@xmath2 because the experiment was done on powder samples.@xcite one needs to average over all directions of the field and we have assumed a single direction here .",
    "nonetheless , fig .",
    "[ explineshapes ] shows that the deviations from a lorentzian in the wings ( here we restrict to @xmath165 , which is not spoiled by an impurity line ) can be accounted for by the spin diffusion assumption and @xmath166",
    ". the result may be partly coincidental because there are other sources of deviations , such as the chemical disorder and the polycristalline nature of the sample .",
    "still we note that this coupling strength is not incompatible with the analysis of nmr which stated that @xmath167.@xcite in any case , from the esr linewidth alone , we can conclude that @xmath164 .",
    "first , for finite - size chains ( 0 dimension ) , we have found a special ( and exact ) `` double - peak '' lineshape ( fig .  [ sxx ] ) which may be interesting in molecular magnets having the geometry of a ring , especially because the lineshape seems insensitive to the strength anisotropy ( up to a rescaling ) and size ( in the limit of small size ) .",
    "we have stressed that such a lineshape usually results from non - markovian correlations in the memory function , which we did find in the calculation of @xmath65 in this case .    in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we have obtained the electron spin resonance in one and two dimensions for the anisotropies relevant to @xmath0 systems , by computing the memory function .",
    "we have provided the exact numerical result for @xmath65 at short times and used it as an initial condition for a long - time spin - diffusion tail , which was taken as an assumption .",
    "we have then calculated the characteristic relaxation time ( or linewidth ) self - consistently , as well as the lineshape .    in one dimension , the spin - diffusion assumption leads to enhance the linewidth by a factor that we have quantitatively estimated ( see fig .  [ linewidth ] [ squares ] ) .",
    "it is about 4 times larger than the perturbative kubo - tomita s result .",
    "when this is true , the lineshape strongly differs from a lorentzian . to compare with experiments , it is interesting to consider another time - scale , @xmath132 which is the cutoff of the memory function ( the physical reason may be intrinsic or extrinsic ; for instance , because of interchain couplings ) .",
    "when @xmath132 is reduced from its self - consistent value , the linewidth decreases and the lineshape crossovers to a lorentzian .",
    "a comparison of both the linewidth and lineshape should therefore allow experimentally to determine the anisotropy strength and @xmath132 ( with a better accuracy than the use of the kubo - tomita formula ) .",
    "note that , given a resonance line , we can extract the anisotropy parameter @xmath62 but we can not tell whether @xmath62 is due to the exchange anisotropy or the dzyaloshinskii - moriya field ( unless the later is forbidden by symmetry ) : both contribute at the same order of magnitude in one dimension.@xcite    in two dimensions , the situation is different and there are two distinct cases :    * _ irreducible case _ ( the dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors do not sum to zero while going around closed loops of the lattice ) : we have argued that the linewidth should vary essentially like @xmath1 . * _ reducible case _ ( the dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors do sum to zero ) : an exact transformation maps again the model onto an exchange anisotropy and , as in one dimension , both contribute at the same order ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "the result in the irreducible case is in fact what the kubo - tomita formula gives , qualitatively .",
    "quantitatively , the prefactor is bounded below by the kubo - tomita result .",
    "in fact if we restrict to the cluster of even size ( @xmath51 ) , we see an excellent agreement with the gaussian decay and we would be tempted to conclude that we see no _ quantitative _ difference with kubo - tomita . by computing the next cluster ( @xmath152 ) , however , the difference turns out to be larger . while it is difficult to know if the difference comes from the odd size of the cluster , we have given in the later case the interpolation to the @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "the self - consistently calculated linewidth is in this case close to @xmath171 or @xmath172 ( fig .",
    "[ hwhm2d ] ) depending on the interpolation time , but still larger than the kubo - tomita s formula , @xmath173 ( and in between , if interplane couplings are present ) .",
    "we have applied the present theory to the two - dimensional kagome zncu@xmath2(oh@xmath2)cl@xmath4,@xcite and concluded that @xmath174 from the esr linewidth .",
    "in addition , the spin diffusion assumption seems to account for the deviations of the lineshape from a lorentzian ( fig .",
    "[ explineshapes ] ) , but single crystals are needed to avoid additional averaging effects . in this compound ,",
    "the out - of - plane dzyaloshinskii - moriya component is irreducible while the in - plane is reducible.@xcite for single crystals , we therefore predict a much larger linewidth when the field is perpendicular to the plane .",
    "we also note that , in absolute values , the irreducible dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions in two dimensions induce a linewidth larger than in one - dimension ( where the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions are always reducible ) . the essential factor that governs",
    "the linewidth in low - dimensional @xmath0 systems is not the strength of the divergence @xmath175 versus @xmath153 of the spin - diffusion ( assuming it exists ) but rather the reducible versus irreducible character of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "we have illustrated this on the kagome lattice but , at high temperatures , the shape of the lattice should not matter ( as long as there are closed loops with dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors not summing to zero ) .",
    "we would like to thank a. zorko for providing us with the experimental data of the lineshape ( ref .  ) .",
