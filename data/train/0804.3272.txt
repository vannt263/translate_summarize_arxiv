    "however , there is no density of states ( dos ) at @xmath32 for both the @xmath2 and 0.15 samples , corresponding to their insulating behaviors . based on these findings",
    ", it is likely that the spectral suppression near @xmath32 is originated from both the jahn - teller distortion and coulomb interaction between cr @xmath7 electrons as proposed in the previous measurements @xcite .",
    "since the ferromagnetism realized by the double - exchange mechanism requires a finite dos at @xmath32 @xcite , the observations indicate that the double - exchange mechanism appears difficult in zn@xmath0cr@xmath1te .",
    "the present results suggest that the ferromagnetic interaction between the spins of the @xmath9,@xmath10 band electrons and local moments of the @xmath11 orbitals is strong but the ferromagnetic interaction between the @xmath11 orbitals is shortranged because the top of the valence band has @xmath11 character @xcite . in order to obtain further understanding of the ferromagnetic interaction , systematic xmcd measurements of `` carrier - doped '' ( i and/or n doped ) zn@xmath0cr@xmath12te are highly desired .",
    "we have performed xmcd and rpes measurements on the ferromagnetic dms zn@xmath0cr@xmath1te ( @xmath2 and 0.15 ) thin films .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath3 dependences of the xmcd spectra provide experimental consistency with the magnetization measurements .",
    "the xmcd line shape is independent of @xmath6 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath67 , indicating that the cr ions responsible for the ferromagnetism have a single chemical environment and a spatially isotropic electronic configuration .",
    "according to the xmcd sum - rule analysis and the @xmath4 dependence of xmcd , the ground states of the ferromagnetic cr ions should involve the electronic configuration with the quenched orbital moment .",
    "the analysis using ci cluster - model calculation suggests that the cr ions responsible for the ferromagnetism substitute for the zn site and are subjected to jahn - teller distortion with isotropic distribution of the distortion axes , and there are two or more kinds of cr ions .",
    "the minority cr ions may be antiferromagnetically coupled with each other .",
    "the @xmath10-@xmath11 exchange constant @xmath15 has been estimated from the electronic structure parameters and is consistent with mcd measurements .",
    "the cr @xmath7 pdos at @xmath32 is suppressed even at @xmath47 , indicating that carrier - induced ferromagnetism appears difficult in zn@xmath0cr@xmath12te .",
    "the suppression of spectral weight at @xmath32 is probably caused by jahn - teller distortion and @xmath11-@xmath11 coulomb interaction .    from the report on the doping effects",
    "@xcite , both the hole - carrier concentration and the inhomogeneous cr distribution affect the ferromagnetic properties of zn@xmath0cr@xmath12te thin film .",
    "in the present work , we have measured zn@xmath0cr@xmath12te thin films having different cr concentration . in this case",
    ", it is likely that the effects of the cr inhomogeneity on the ferromagnetism are more dominant than these of the carrier concentration .",
    "considering the fact that the ferromagnetic xmcd signal of zn@xmath0cr@xmath1te is independent of cr concentration and that zn@xmath0cr@xmath1te is highly insulating , it is likely that the carrier - induced ferromagnetism is not important in zn@xmath0cr@xmath12te and the inhomogeneous distribution of cr atoms dominantly influences the ferromagnetic properties of zn@xmath0cr@xmath1te .",
