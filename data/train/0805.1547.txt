    "consider a finite object , immersed in the vacuum , of arbitrary form defined by the surface @xmath3 and made of a non magnetic material with dielectric function @xmath4 . in the non - retarded limit the behavior of the electromagnetic fields",
    "is determined solely by the electric potential .",
    "the solution of the 3d laplace equation on the boundary of the object satisfies the fredholm integral equation @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the green s function of free space , @xmath7 and @xmath8 points on the surface , @xmath3 , of the object , and @xmath9 is the electric potential derived from exterior sources .",
    "the properties of the kernel of this integral equation have been studied in the old potential theory @xcite . due to its properties it is possible to apply the theory of the fredholm integral equation and the different analytical and numerical methods to its solution . here",
    "we deal with the most simple numerical method , known as boundary element method .",
    "we have adapted it to obtain the resonances of the system , i.e. , to find solutions different from zero when the applied external field , @xmath9 , is identically zero .",
    "the method consists in the discretization of the surface @xmath3 in @xmath10 small planes of sizes @xmath11 in the positions @xmath12 with normal unit vector @xmath13 and potential @xmath14 .",
    "a homogeneous system of linear equations is obtained : @xmath15 with @xmath16 the zero point energy of the system is given by @xmath17 note that there is no restriction on the shape and connectivity of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we can consider a surface that consists of two arbitrary non overlapping surfaces @xmath18 and @xmath19 with arbitrary positions and orientations .",
    "it is possible to study an object above a substrate by letting one of the objects be the mirror image of the other .",
    "the total energy of the system is obtained by numerically calculating the integral of the complete system and subtracting the value obtained considering the objects independently .",
    "the computational time goes like @xmath20 , but @xmath10 grows slower than in methods like that in @xcite , since our method is based on a discretization of a surface . with this method",
    "it is possible to , within a few hours , obtain results for the interaction energy with a precision of 1% at distances down to 5% of the diameter of the smallest of the objects .",
    "this conclusion we draw from comparisons with high precision calculations based on methods in @xcite .",
    "normal forces between a finite gold cylinder and a gold substrate ; ( a ) circular cross section with diameter @xmath21 ; ( b ) square cross section with side length @xmath21.,width=302 ]    in figure ( [ fig : i ] ) we show results from calculations of the interaction between a gold cylinder and a gold substrate .",
    "the base of the cylinder is kept parallel to the substrate and at the distance @xmath2 .",
    "panel ( a ) is for cylinders with circular cross section of diameter @xmath21 and panel ( b ) for square cross sections with side length @xmath21 .",
    "the curves are for different heights , @xmath22 .",
    "we have plotted the relative difference between our results and those from pfa .",
    "the pfa result is the force per unit area between two half spaces times the base area ; it does not depend on the height at all .",
    "first we observe in both panels that all the curves tend to zero in the small separation limit which means that all of them present the behavior of two parallel plates in the limit . at large distances a volume dependence",
    "is observed corresponding to dipolar interactions .",
    "this means that a larger cylinder has a stronger interaction with the substrate . at intermediate distances",
    "we observe that in the circular cylinder case , panel ( a ) , the bigger cylinders always show a stronger vdw force .",
    "one can expect this behavior in an interaction that depends on the quantity of material , as is the case , for example , of an additive pairwise interaction .",
    "however the square cylinders in panel ( b ) show a completely different behavior : a non - monotonic relationship between the forces and the volumes of the objects .",
    "there are regions where an increase of the volume leads to a decrease in the force .",
    "for example at a distance smaller than @xmath23 the square cylinder with height @xmath24 is expected to show a greater force that the cylinder with @xmath25 , but it does not .",
    "this indicates a sort of resonant behavior that depends on the geometry .",
    "these results agree with the geometry dependence of the resonant modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this lack of direct relation between the force and volume of the object is also observed in the case of lateral forces .",
    "lateral forces between two gold cylinders kept at the vertical separation @xmath26 and moved horizontally the distance @xmath2 ; ( a ) circular cross section with diameter @xmath21 ; ( b ) square cross section with side length @xmath21.,width=302 ]    in figure ( [ fig : lateral ] ) we show results from calculations of lateral forces between pairs of finite cylinders .",
    "initially the cylinders are considered aligned above each other with parallel bases at a distance @xmath27 from each other .",
    "then there is a horizontal , lateral displacement @xmath2 parallel to one of its sides of length @xmath21 ( in the case of cylinders with square cross section ) .",
    "the energy is calculated at different positions @xmath2 and the lateral force is obtained through numerical derivation .",
    "we observe that in the case of circular cylinders , panel ( a ) the objects with greater height show a greater lateral force than the objects with smaller height .",
    "again this is the kind of behavior that one can expect through an additive interaction .",
    "however this is not always the case when one considers finite square cylinders . in panel",
    "( b ) we present results for pairs of square cylinders of the same height . the lateral force increases in general with the height but for the cylinder of height @xmath24 the force is smaller than for cylinders of heights @xmath28 , and @xmath29 in a region of lateral displacements .",
    "note , the wide region of linear behavior in the lateral force , which implies a harmonic oscillation around the completely aligned equilibrium .",
    "the pfa predicts a constant lateral force ; it has been shown that this happens in the perfect metal case for periodic 2d steps for small normal separation @xcite .",
    "however the non - constant linear form dominates the behavior of the dispersion forces when the objects are in close to alignment with each other even if they are in close proximity .",
    "this is a geometric dependence of the interactions between the borders of the objects that the pfa is not able to take into account .",
    "torque between two gold cylinders with rectangular cross section , @xmath30 , and height @xmath22 , kept at the vertical separation @xmath26.,width=302 ]    in figure ( [ fig : rotational ] ) we present results for rotational forces , or torques , between rectangular finite cylinders .",
    "the base is a rectangle with the longer side twice the length of the shorter .",
    "each curve corresponds to a different height .",
    "initially the cylinders are considered in their position of minimum energy where they are with their bases parallel and completely aligned .",
    "they are rotated around a perpendicular axis through the center of the bases .",
    "we calculated the energy at different angles and found the rotational force by numerical differentiation we observe that the rotational force is not stronger for the greatest cylinder .",
    "the cylinder with height @xmath23 is of a sort of resonant height that gives the maximum rotational force . also here , like in the lateral force , it is easy to see that the pfa will predict a constant rotational force in the proximity of the close alignment .",
    "however , one expects the non - constant linear behavior of the force close to the equilibrium position , independently of the proximity of the objects .    a non - monotonic behavior of the casimir forces was also found in a recent work on perfect metal systems @xcite .",
    "it involves complex interactions between walls and objects .",
    "here we have shown that non - monotonic and non - additive behaviors can be seen in more simple systems when the effects of the materials are taken into account .",
    "these results are in conflict with those expected in pfa and from pairwise lj interactions . here , we have furthermore presented a method that constitutes a useful and versatile tool for the calculations of vdw forces in different configurations ; it is able to deal with objects of different geometries and in different configurations ; it gives fast and high precision calculations .",
    "the precision can be improved with an optimal discretization of the surface and by exploiting the symmetries of the systems , like axial and translational symmetries .",
    "the method can be generalized to deal with systems that involve different materials .",

    "<S> so it is common to use more simple and accessible approximate methods that rely on additivity approximations . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on an assumption of a sort of additive interaction ; the force is calculated as the sum of contributions from different parts of the system . as a consequence </S>",
