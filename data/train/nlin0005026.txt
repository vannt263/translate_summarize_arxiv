    "great attention has been paid to the duration of this laminar period which exhibits universal power law distribution in a broad class of systems  @xcite .",
    "noise in the system prevents its state from approaching the subspace close beyond the noise level , thus has important effects on the laminar period distribution  @xcite or the escape time  @xcite .",
    "in noisy environment , bubbling and on - off intermittency are essentially the same phenomenon .",
    "sensitivity in nonlinear systems can be very useful for applications such as controlling global dynamics of the system by local tiny perturbations  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the sensitivity of on - off intermittency may lead to any potential application of the phenomenon .",
    "an observation is that in a class of symmetric systems , on - off intermittency can be symmetry - breaking  @xcite , namely , the bursting behavior does not possess the system symmetry when the system has two symmetric but distinct attractors .",
    "this letter reports that a combination of the sensitivity of on - off intermittency and the symmetry - breaking of the bursting can result in remarkable features in the systems subjected to a weak modulation signal in the noisy environment .",

    "the behavior of the system is determined by the competition between the diffusion and the drift of the brownian motion . if the drift time @xmath39 is much smaller than the diffusion time @xmath40 , the drift is dominant over the diffusion , and the system will either come to a metastable state induced by the noisy input for @xmath41 , or approach some state away from the invariant subspace for @xmath42 . in both cases ,",
    "the weak noisy input has no significant effects on the system behavior , i.e. the system is insensitive to the modulation . on the other hand , the diffusion is dominant for @xmath43 , and the system can have access to both the level of the weak input and the boundary of the nonlinearity , exhibiting typical on - off intermittency and sensitivity to the weak modulation .",
    "variation of the parameter @xmath6 or @xmath36 affects the competition between the drift and the diffusion , and the system is expected to display optimal response to the weak modulation with resonant characterization .",

    "the system produces symmetric bursting pattern with @xmath57 ; while the bursting pattern is reorganized to manifest the weak signal after it is fed into the system ( see fig .",
    "the most interesting and practically important property is that the weak signal is manifested even buried in a relatively high level of noise , namely , the _ robustness of the supersensitivity_. this behavior originates from the _ symmetry - breaking of the on - off intermittency _ in the system .    to demonstrate the above analysis , we employ the following system in simulations  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 constitutes the forced duffing chaotic oscillator . with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "the duffing system is chaotic and @xmath62 .",
    "the nonlinearity of the variable @xmath63 is related to an experimental model of superconducting quantum interference device ( squid )  @xcite .",
    "however , we should stress that the specific form of the nonlinearity is of no importance for the phenomena .",

    "the agreement demonstrates that the general stochastic model in eq .",
    "( [ sys ] ) gives good account for this type of system even though the motion in the subspace is deterministic chaos .",
    "it is difficult to perform generally a quantitative analysis of the system response to the weak signal based on the linear dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ sys ] ) as parameters @xmath6 or @xmath36 changes , because the effective boundary @xmath68 changes with the nonlinearity and the linear dynamical model with an effective reflecting boundary is often not sufficient to capture the dynamical property if @xmath69 is appreciately positive .",
    "moreover , as the parameters change , the relaxation time @xmath19 may become comparable to the bit duration @xmath15 , and the transient behavior plays an important role in the system response and an adiabatic approximation is not valid any more . to demonstrate the resonant properties , we rely on simulations with the system in eq .",

    "to better characterize the response of the system to the modulation , we transfer the output series @xmath0 into a binary stream @xmath71 by a threshold crossing process : suppose @xmath0 becomes larger than a prescribed threshold @xmath72 at some moment , after that @xmath71 will keep at @xmath73 until @xmath0 crosses @xmath74 at another moment ; @xmath71 will not switch back from @xmath75 to @xmath76 until @xmath0 crosses @xmath72 again , and so on .",
    "this binary presentation captures the most important feature of the transition of the bursting pattern between the two symmetric attractors .",

    "the exact value of @xmath72 is not crucial for the properties described below . in the following , we fix @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and take the cross - correlation function @xmath81 between @xmath13 and @xmath71 estimated using @xmath82 bits of a random stream of @xmath13 to demonstrate the resonant behavior in the system .",
    "\\(1 ) _ with the change of @xmath6_. for @xmath6 rather below the critical point @xmath83 , the system has a metastable state close to the level of the noisy input , and the diffusion is not strong enough to produce large bursts frequently enough , @xmath81 will be small . on the opposite ,",
    "if @xmath6 is rather above the critical point , the drift is also dominant so that the system can seldom access to the level of the weak modulation , and becomes insensitive to the switching of @xmath13 between @xmath14 , resulting in a small @xmath81 again .",
    "close to the critical point , the system can access to the level of the weak signal and produce large bursts frequently due to strong enough diffusion .",
    "the switching of the weak signal is `` sensed '' and manifested by asymmetrical bursting to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , giving an optimal value of @xmath81 .",
    "this precess is illustrated by @xmath81 as a function of @xmath6 in fig . 2 for various @xmath67 values .",
    "( 2)_with the change of @xmath36_. for a small @xmath36 where the drift is dominant over diffusion , the system is not sensitive to the weak noisy input and @xmath81 assumes a small value . with the increase of @xmath36 ,",
    "the diffusion becomes stronger , resulting in a smaller relaxation time @xmath19 and more frequent large bursts , and the system becomes more sensitive to the weak input . in the noise - free case @xmath70 , the increased sensitivity enables @xmath71 to keep closer in phase to the weak signal @xmath13 and @xmath81 approaches closer to @xmath84 if the system maintains to work in the symmetry - breaking regime , and in general a resonant behavior is not expected .",
    "the picture becomes quite different if @xmath85 . with smaller @xmath19 and",
    "increased sensitivity , the system can keep up with and manifest more and more noise - induced transitions in shorter time - scales , and the transition rate of @xmath71 between @xmath14 may become much higher than that of @xmath13 , leading to a decreasing @xmath81 .",
    "an optimal response is achieved when the diffusion is strong enough to become sensitive to the weak input but not too strong to manifest a lot of noise - induced transitions in short time - scales .",
    "typical example of the system response as a function of @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "the above resonant behavior is similar to the conventional stochastic resonance where a dynamical system displays increased sensitivity to a subthreshold signal with an optimal level of additive noise , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review .",
    "resonance occurs when a noise - controlled time - scale in the system matches that of the signal . in our system ,",
    "the underlying mechanism of the resonant behavior is quite different .",
    "the sensitivity to an extremely weak signal is induced by the _ multiplicative _ chaotic or stochastic motion in the subspace . to achieve this sensitivity",
    ", it is required that the system is in the on - off intermittency regime so that it can become susceptible to the weak signal by coming close enough to the subspace , and manifest and amplify it by quick enough large bursts away from the subspace with symmetry - breaking .",
    "as system parameters @xmath6 and @xmath36 change , a competition between these two factors leads to the resonant behavior .",
    "more interestingly , resonant behavior with respect to the change of @xmath36 , the level of the multiplicative chaos ( noise ) , necessarily occurs only in the presence of the additive noise due to the nature of this competition .",
    "these features are generic and universal in a general class of systems displaying on - off intermittency with symmetry breaking . multiplicative stochastic resonance has been studied by gammaitoni _",
    "@xcite in a multiplicatively driven bistable system with @xmath86 . in that case , the system is out of the regime of on - off intermittency , and consequently can not display the property of ( super)sensitivity , and the resonance with respect to the change of @xmath6 was not resported .",
    "now consider the system from the viewpoint of transmission and amplification of a weak signal @xmath54 contaminated with channel noise @xmath87 through a system displaying on - off intermittency with symmetry - breaking .",
    "it is very interesting and practically important that more information about the signal may be obtained from the output @xmath71 than from the noisy input @xmath88 itself , besides the fact that the weak signal has been amplifyed to a level discernible with a low resolution detector . to examine the information gain",
    ", we compare @xmath81 with the correlation between the signal @xmath54 and the total noisy input @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath90 and their difference are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath81 comes to a saturated value for @xmath91 , where the noise - induced transitions between @xmath3 and @xmath4 in short time - scales are rarely manifested by large bursts .",
    "this value does not approach @xmath84 as @xmath90 due to an average time - delay between @xmath71 and @xmath13 induced by the relaxation time which is longer for weaker signal .",
    "clearly , appreciable information gain is obtained by the system in a broad range of @xmath67 , and an optimal gain is found at a certain @xmath67 value .",
    "if taking into account the effect of the time - delay between @xmath71 and @xmath13 , e.g. by defining @xmath92 as the maximum of the correlation between @xmath71 and @xmath93 , the information gain region can be wider ( fig .  4 ) .    to conclude",
    ", we demonstrate interesting universal features of robustness of supersensitivity , resonance and information gain in a class of nonlinear system subjected to a weak modulation .",
    "these systems present a new mechanism of resonant behavior compared to conventional stochastic resonance . while intermittent loss of synchronization may be harmful for any applications employing high - quality synchronization  @xcite , the features found in this letter are meaningful for potential applications of on - off intermittency . on - off intermittency",
    "has been demonstrated in many experimental systems and we believe that the behaviors reported in this work can be tested in physical experiments .",
