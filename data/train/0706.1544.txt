    "the scientific return of the lat instrument depends on how accurately we monitor its performance , and how promptly we can fix problems .",
    "such data monitoring is a very complex task , since the lat contains more than 850000 channels in the trackers , 1536 csi crystals and 97 acd plastic scintillator tiles and ribbons .",
    "the standard way is to monitor the parameter values , correlations and time evolution ( by means of histograms and charts ) , to check their consistency with a well known reference .",
    "this methodology is explained elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a different ( and complementary ) approach is to try to find differences between the reference data set and the just taken data set ; both data sets being represented in a n - dimensional space of n selected parameters .",
    "classification trees can provide an efficient way of finding potential differences between data sets in an automated fashion .",
    "here we used the random forest method @xcite , and a custom interface described in @xcite .    in this approach ,",
    "we use the classification error to quantify the magnitude of the differences between the two data sets ; and we use the z - score value to pinpoint the parameters where the differences lie . both classification error and z - scores are estimated during the growing of the forest , using the so - called out - of - bag ( oob ) events , which are a bootstrapped sample of events that were not used in the growing of the individual trees of the forest . the classification error ` oob err ` is the percentage of oob events that were incorrectly predicted by the forest . in case of equal data sets ( no separation possible ) : oob err @xmath0 50% .",
    "if the two event classes can be separated ( they are different in some way ) , then oob err @xmath1 50% .",
    "the z - score is a statistical measure , that relies on the oob err , to estimate the importance of a given variable to distinguish between the two data sets .",
    "the z - score quantifies the statistical significance ( @xmath0 number of sigmas ) of the differences between the two event classes in a given parameter .",
    "each of the n parameters used to grow the forest has its own z - score value . high z - score ( e.g. @xmath2 5 ) implies large ( statistically significant ) differences between the two event classes in that variable .",
    "in order to test the working principle of this novel technique we chose several data sets ( event classes ) taken during the pre - launch tests during the fall 2006 at the naval research lab . these data ( cosmic rays , mostly muons )",
    "were processed with the standard lat event reconstruction software .",
    "we defined the event ` class a ` as taken when lat was supposedly working correctly ; this is our reference data set . `",
    "class b ` will be the data that needs to be evaluated .",
    "the event ` class b1 ` contains data taken when lat was supposedly working correctly , while ` class b2 ` is data taken when lat was not working correctly . in the b2-type data , the information from half layer 0 from tracker tower 10 was not properly read ; thus there is missing information in some events .",
    "therefore , in this test , we expect to have compatibility between a and b1 ; while we expect differences between a and b2 .",
    "two forests of trees were grown ; one using a and b1 type data ( a - b1 ) , and the other one using a and b2 type data ( a - b2 ) . for this test",
    ", we used only high level data ( derived quantities , using the reconstruction software , from basic detector outputs ) and we only considered non - empty events which triggered tower 10 .",
    "the random forests were grown using 10000 events , 1000 trees , 80 variables and 4 variables / node .",
    "the time required to grow each of these forests was less than 1/2 hour in dual 1.8ghz opteron cpu machine .",
    "the classification error vs the number of trees is shown in the left - hand plot of fig .",
    "while there is no effective separation between event types a and b1 ( err @xmath0 50% ) , the separation between event types a and b2 is clearly possible , which implies differences between these event classes .",
    "note also that 100 trees are enough for a good separation ( in this example ) which would allow us to grow the forest 10 times faster .",
    "the highest z - score in the a - b2 random forest was for the parameter that denotes the number of clusters ( hit planes ) in the main track ; tkr1hits .",
    "the z - score for this parameter was 41 ; which implies large differences in this variable .",
    "a charge particle passing through all the 19 layers ( 36 planes ) of the lat tracker ( all towers ) will have tkr1hits @xmath0 36 .",
    "the right - hand plot of fig 1 shows the distribution of tkr1hits for the event classes a , b1 and b2 .",
    "class b2 has a larger fraction of events with odd number of hit planes .",
    "this is due to the missing information from plane 0 for some of the events .",
    "random forest can be a useful tool to monitor the performance of lat during on - orbits operations .",
    "a test with pre - launch data suggests that the method is fast and efficient .",
    "application of this method to low level data would increase the potential of discovering hardware problems , at the expense of more computing power .",
    "note that the application of this method to monitor lat data during on - orbits operations is not straight forward .",
    "the success depends on : ` a ) ` the correct selection of the reference data set ; and ` b ) ` the selection of the variables ( high / low level ) and filters to be used .",
    "these selections will be tuned up prior to launch ; yet this learning will probably continue during the first months of space operation ."
