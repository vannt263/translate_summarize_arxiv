    "<S> charge ordering is one of the most intriguing and extensively studied phenomena in correlated electronic materials because of its strong impact on electron transport properties including superconductivity . despite its ubiquitousness in correlated systems , the occurrence of charge ordering in iron - based superconductors </S>",

    "<S> we show that the present observations can be attributed to the surpassing of the role of local coulomb interaction by the poorly screened longer - range coulomb interactions , facilitated by large hund s rule coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> charge order ( co ) has been observed in a wide range of strongly correlated electron systems ( scess ) , such as manganites @xcite , magnetite @xcite , cobaltates @xcite , nickelates @xcite , and cuprates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such ubiquity comes unexpected since the two generic leading energy scales in electron systems  the kinetic energy and local coulomb interaction @xmath1generally favor uniform charge distribution instead . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been shown that co may result from a compromised interplay of charge with the spin  @xcite and/or orbital  @xcite degrees of freedom . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the bad - metal behavior of scess @xcite implies that co can also be driven by the poorly screened longer - range coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the scess that exhibit co have fractional nominal valence due to charge doping or mixed valence in nature @xcite , which allows charge fluctuation free of the energy penalty from @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> an exception comes when @xmath1 is surpassed by hund s rule coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ubiquity of co is thus a manifestation of electronic correlation effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , co is readily characterized by diffraction , x - ray scattering , and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these features of co have made its study an effective route to understanding scess in general and helping resolve some current grand problems in condensed matter physics , such as high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates and colossal magnetoresistance in manganites in particular .    </S>",
    "<S> naturally , it is desirable to know how co emerges in iron - based superconductors ( fescs ) @xcite , which appear to have all the aforementioned ingredients for co : they contain the charge , spin , orbital degrees of freedom @xcite and show bad - metal behavior @xcite . oddly enough , to date , convincing evidence of co in fescs is still lacking . compared with the other scess , </S>",
    "<S> fescs are indeed somehow different . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the origin of strong electron correlation in fescs is attributed to the hund s rule coupling instead of @xmath1 @xcite likely due to the suppression of @xmath1 via strongly coupled charge multipole polarizations of fe and anion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this peculiar charge dynamics could mediate electron pairing for superconductivity @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of @xmath1 also favor the formation of co. hence , finding co in fescs has become an important step to our understanding of fescs and co mechanisms in scess .    here </S>",
    "<S> we report the direct observation of long - range static charge order in fescs with systematic stm measurement on fete , the parent compound of the fe(te , se , s ) family of fescs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fete was chosen because of its simple structure ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) and arguably strongest electronic correlation in the fesc system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of bulk fete is known to possess the metallic _ bicollinear _ antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin order @xcite , named after the pattern of alternating two columns of fe sites with spin - up and two columns of fe sites with spin - down ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath2-type _ in the context of manganites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter viewpoint bridges these two important classes of scess : fescs and manganites . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has been shown that various material - dependent magnetic orders in fescs @xcite and manganites @xcite are unified in a spin - fermion model . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we find that co in fete peculiarly follows the same bicollinear @xmath2-type order , a pattern that has not been observed or predicted before in the charge channel . </S>",
    "<S> even more strikingly , this co is realized in a sces with integer nominal valence . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the @xmath2-type co can be well accounted for by including long - range coulomb interaction in the spin - fermion model .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiments were carried out in a unisoku uhv @xmath3he stm system equipped with a molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) chamber for _ in situ _ film growth . </S>",
    "<S> single crystal fe@xmath4te samples usually contain a sizeable amount of excessive fe atoms , which are known to bring substantial extrinsic effects such as transforming the metallic fete to a semiconductor @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> 2 , a to d ) shows that the structural transition is correlated with the appearance of a striped pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern is barely visible at 63  k and completely disappears at @xmath9  k. the stripes are formed by the te atoms and only visible at very low bias voltage , which rules out the possibility of surface reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of lattice constants by stm identifies the stripe orientation as the fm direction ( b - axis ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the stripes is presented in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the pattern is only visible at low energy within @xmath10  mev of the fermi level . inside this energy window , </S>",
    "<S> the stripes are static and remain unchanged with different bias voltage . as clearly demonstrated in the figures , the bright stripes of te atoms in the topmost layer alternate with the dark ones in the afm direction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the periodicity is @xmath11 , the same as that of the @xmath2-type spin order . to gain more insight into the origin of the stripes , we mark two adjacent te atoms in fig . 1b as `` a '' and `` b '' . if a is bright , then b must be dark . here </S>",
    "<S> the key point is that these two sites a and b differ in the configuration of their neighboring fe spins : a is adjacent to one up and three down spins on fe , while b to one down and three up spins . since the charge fluctuations on fe cations and te anions are strongly coupled @xcite , the contrast displayed by the te atoms actually reflects the existence of a charge - stripe order in the fe plane . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the concurrence of stripe and afm order at the structural transition indicates that the charge - stripe order is tied to the long - range @xmath2-type afm order .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that previous neutron scattering studies @xcite revealed the existence of strong spin fluctuations in the fete system . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the long - range @xmath2-type afm order only makes a small and very low - energy contribution to the entire spin dynamics , while the higher energy part is governed by other competing orders such as the @xmath12 plaquette spin order @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) dispersion of the itinerant electrons . </S>",
    "<S> , width=576 ]    another relevant finding is that the electrons are much more itinerant in the fm direction than in the afm direction . </S>",
    "<S> an anisotropic dispersion is revealed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the sts detects the differential tunneling conductance @xmath13 , which gives a measure of the local density of states ( ldos ) of electrons at energy @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 mapping was performed on the surface of fete . at each data point , the feedback was turned off and the bias modulation was turned on to record @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure resulted in a series of spatial mapping of ldos at various bias voltages . </S>",
    "<S> a typical @xmath13 mapping at 60 mv is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a . the autocorrelation analysis ( inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) reveals a wave vector exclusively along the b - axis . a parabolic dispersion ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) is obtained by plotting the wave vector versus energy . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion is highly anisotropic and only observed in the fm direction . </S>",
    "<S> the parent compound of iron - pnictide superconductor ca(fe@xmath15co@xmath16)@xmath17as@xmath17 also exhibits similar property @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the present results for fete are nontrivial because of the different electron transport behavior in fete from that in the iron pnictides . in fete , </S>",
    "<S> the electric conductivity in the fm direction is larger than that in the afm direction @xcite , while the opposite is observed for iron pnictides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency between the anisotropy in band dispersion and electric conductivity in fete unambiguously indicates that the itinerant electrons hop much more easily along the fm direction .    </S>",
    "<S> the highly anisotropic itinerancy is a reminiscence of the electron behavior in the manganites @xcite and suggests that the itinerant electrons in fete move in a localized spin background and are favorably described by the double - exchange mechanism in the spin - fermion model @xcite . in this model , the itinerant electrons and the localized spins @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> are coupled by the strong on - site hund s rule coupling @xmath19 , which is a fm exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an itinerant electron hopping between two sites with the same ( opposite ) localized spins will experience zero ( @xmath20 ) energy barrier , leading to dispersive ( nondispersive ) electronic states along the fm ( afm ) directions and the so - called double - exchange ferromagnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic @xmath2-type afm spin order in fete itself results from a compromised interplay between the double - exchange ferromagnetism and the antiferromagnetism that originates from the superexchange between the localized spins @xcite .    the observed charge - stripe order in fete </S>",
    "<S> can be readily reproduced by inclusion of long - range intersite coulomb interactions @xmath21 ( thanks to the poor screening in fete ) into a model @xmath22 that can account for the metallic @xmath2-type afm spin order with highly anisotropic dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian reads @xmath23 , where @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the electron number operator on the @xmath26th fe site . if @xmath27 refers to the @xmath27th - neighbor , one may use @xmath28 to approximate the screened coulomb potential , where @xmath29 is the dielectric constant of the material and @xmath30 the @xmath27th - neighbor fe - fe bond length . </S>",
    "<S> then the fe square sublattice leads to @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first analyze the effect of @xmath32 alone without considering the kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the averaged filling of the itinerant electrons per fe site . </S>",
    "<S> then , the problem can be mapped to a classical spin model @xmath35 plus a constant . substituting @xmath36 by @xmath37 , we arrive at the @xmath38-@xmath39-@xmath40 spin model , which is known to yield the @xmath2-type afm `` spin '' order when @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical condition is satisfied by @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the @xmath43-@xmath44-@xmath45 model alone is ready to yield the observed @xmath2-type _ charge _ order with @xmath46 on the `` spin''-up sites and @xmath47 on the `` spin''-down sites .    </S>",
    "<S> the above charge - stripe order is expected to be weakened by the kinetic energy contributed from @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the negligible kinetic energy along the afm direction compared with that along the fm direction warrants the stoner - type instability of `` spin '' polarization , namely the charge difference @xmath48 between the spin - up fe site and the spin - down fe site . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the charge - stripe order still survives even for small @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is explicitly shown in fig . s2 , where @xmath48 is calculated using the aforementioned spin - fermion model for @xmath22 . in the supplemental material  @xcite , we also demonstrate how the effect of local coulomb interactions is suppressed by the double - exchange mechanism , which is necessary for @xmath21 to be effective in driving the co instability .     </S>",
