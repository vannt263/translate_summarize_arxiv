    "the possibility that nature hides the last possible symmetry of the @xmath5-matrix , supersymmetry ( susy ) , in the form of a broken symmetry of the fundamental interactions is one of the most intriguing puzzles over the last @xmath6 years of high energy physics .",
    "susy offers a most tantalizing paradigm to unify particle physics interactions with gravity , and it might even provide a clue to a more fundamental superstring unification of all interactions . as such susy will be scrutinized in great detail at the lhc",
    ". it also offers a possible solution to the longstanding naturalness problem in the higgs sector of the sm  @xcite .",
    "if susy is realized around the tev scale , the lhc experiments shall be able to directly produce the susy particles for masses smaller than a few tev@xcite . among the many strategies devised to hunt for susy , flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) offer perhaps a unique laboratory to seek for the new signs of physics beyond the sm . in the sm",
    "the fcnc effects are completely absent at the tree - level . at one loop ,",
    "however , they are possible , but then the contributions from the new particles enter on equal footing with those from sm particles . in certain regions of the parameter space the new physical effects may well dominate the sm contributions .",
    "this is particularly so when the sm one - loop effects turn out to be highly suppressed . in such situations",
    "the sole observation of these fcnc processes would be instant evidence of new physics .",
    "an example of this kind of appealing scenarios occurs within the fcnc physics of the sm higgs boson ( @xmath7 ) interactions with quarks .",
    "for example , the fcnc vertex @xmath8 may lead ( at one loop ) to such rare decays as @xmath9 or @xmath10 , depending on the mass of @xmath7 . both of these modes",
    "are extremely suppressed at one loop , with branching ratios of order @xmath11 or less  , hence @xmath12 orders of magnitude below other more conventional ( and relatively well measured ) fcnc processes like @xmath13 .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) introduces new sources of fcnc interactions mediated by the strongly - interacting sector .",
    "they are produced by the misalignment of the quark mass matrix with the squark mass matrix , and the main parameter characterizing these interactions is the non - flavor - diagonal term in the squark - mass - matrix , which we parameterize in the standard fashion@xcite as @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the flavor - diagonal mass - term of the @xmath16-flavor squark .",
    "since there are squarks of different chiralities , there are different @xmath17 parameters for the different chirality mixings . in this work we will assume flavor - mixing only among the left - chiral squarks , since these mixing terms are expected to be the largest ones by renormalization group analysis  @xcite .",
    "some work in relation with the mssm higgs bosons fcncs has already been performed  . in this work",
    "we compute and analyze the production of any mssm higgs boson ( @xmath18 ) at the lhc , followed by the one - loop fcnc decay @xmath19 or @xmath20 , and we find the maximum production rates of the combined cross - section : @xmath21 @xmath22 being a pair of heavy quarks @xmath23 or @xmath24 , taking into account the restrictions from the experimental determination of @xmath25  .",
    "for other signals of susy fcnc at the lhc , without higgs bosons couplings see ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we give a summarized explanation of the computation . for further details see refs.@xcite .",
    "we include the full one - loop susy - qcd contributions to the fcnc partial decay widths @xmath26 in the observable ( [ eq : hqq - def ] ) .",
    "the higgs sector parameters ( masses and cp - even mixing angle @xmath27 ) have been treated using the leading @xmath28 and @xmath29 approximation to the one - loop result  @xcite .",
    "the higgs bosons total decay widths @xmath30 are computed at leading order , including all the relevant channels : @xmath31 .",
    "the off - shell decays @xmath32 have also been included .",
    "this is necessary to consistently compute the total decay width of @xmath33 in regions of the parameter space where the maximization of the cross - section ( [ eq : hqq - def ] ) is obtained at the expense of greatly diminishing the partial decay widths of the two - body process @xmath34 ( due to dramatic quantum effects that may reduce the cp - even mixing angle @xmath27 to small values  @xcite ) .",
    "the one - loop decay rate @xmath35 has been taken from  @xcite and the off - shell decay partial widths have been recomputed explicitly .",
    "the mssm higgs boson production cross - sections have been computed using the programs ` higlu 2.101 ` and ` pphtt 1.1`@xcite .",
    "these programs include the following channels : gluon - gluon fusion , and associated production with top- and bottom - quarks .",
    "we have used the leading order approximation for all channels .",
    "the qcd renormalization scale is set to the default value for each program .",
    "we have used the set of cteq4l pdf@xcite .    for the constraints on the fcnc parameters , we use @xmath36 as the experimentally allowed range within three standard deviations  .",
    "we also require that the sign of the @xmath37 amplitude is the same as in the sm  @xcite .    running quark masses ( @xmath38 ) and strong coupling constants ( @xmath39 ) are used throughout , with the renormalization scale set to the decaying higgs boson mass in the decay processes .    given this setup ,",
    "we have performed a monte - carlo maximization  @xcite of the cross - section  ( [ eq : hqq - def ] ) over the mssm parameter space , keeping the parameter @xmath40 fixed , and under the simplification that the squark and gluino soft - susy - breaking parameter masses are at the same scale : @xmath41    although we have performed a full one - loop computation , involving the exact diagonalization of the @xmath42 squark mass matrix , it is enlightening to look at the approximate leading expressions to understand the qualitative trend of the results .",
    "the susy - qcd contribution to the @xmath37 amplitude can be approximated to : @xmath43 whereas the mssm higgs bosons fcnc effective couplings behave as : @xmath44 the different structure of the amplitudes in eqs .",
    "( [ bsgamma ] ) and  ( [ eq : approxleading ] ) , will permit to obtain and appreciable fcnc higgs boson decay rate , while the prediction for @xmath25 stays inside the experimentally allowed range .",
    "for the analysis of the bottom - strange production channel , we study first the higgs boson branching ratio ( [ eq : hqq - def ] ) . figure  [ fig : hbsma0 ] shows the maximum value of @xmath45 as a function of the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass @xmath46 .",
    "we observe that fairly large values of @xmath47 are obtained .",
    "table  [ tab : maximnowindow ] shows the actual values of the maximum branching ratios , and the parameters that provide them for each higgs boson .",
    "let us discuss first the general trend , which is valid for all studied processes : the maximum is attained at large @xmath48 and moderate @xmath49 .",
    "the susy - qcd contribution to @xmath37  ( [ bsgamma ] ) decreases with @xmath48 , therefore to keep @xmath25 in the allowed range when @xmath48 is small , it has to be compensated with a low value of @xmath49 , providing a small fcnc effective coupling  ( [ eq : approxleading ] ) . on the other hand , at large @xmath48 the second factor in eq .",
    "( [ bsgamma ] ) decreases , allowing a larger value of @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the first factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxleading ] ) grows , but the second factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxleading ] ) stays fixed ( provided that @xmath50 ) , overall providing a larger value of the effective coupling . on the other hand , a too large value of @xmath49 has to be compensated by a small value of @xmath51 in ( [ bsgamma ] ) , provoking a reduction in ( [ eq : approxleading ] ) . in the end",
    ", the balance of the various interactions involved produces the results of table  [ tab : maximnowindow ] .",
    "the maximum value of the branching ratio for the lightest higgs boson channel is obtained in the _ small @xmath52 scenario _  @xcite . in this scenario the coupling of bottom quarks to @xmath53",
    "is extremely suppressed .",
    "the large value of @xmath54 is obtained because the total decay width @xmath33 in the denominator of ( [ eq : hqq - def ] ) tends to zero ( table  [ tab : maximnowindow ] ) , and not because a large fcnc partial decay width in its numerator  @xcite .     as a function of @xmath46 , @xmath55.,width=226 ]    the leading production channel of @xmath53 at the lhc at high @xmath40",
    "is the associated production with bottom quarks , and therefore the @xmath53 production will be suppressed when @xmath54 is enhanced .",
    "we have to perform a combined analysis of the full process  ( [ eq : hqq - def ] ) to obtain the maximum production rate of fcnc higgs bosons meditated events at the lhc .",
    "figure  [ fig : hbsprod ] and table  [ tab : hbs - maxims ] show the result of the maximization of the production cross - section  ( [ eq : hqq - def ] ) .",
    "the central column of table  [ tab : hbs - maxims ] shows that when performing the combined maximization @xmath33 has a much larger value , and therefore the maximum of the combined cross - section is not obtained in the _ small @xmath52 scenario_. the number of expected events at the lhc is around 50,000 events/100@xmath56 .",
    "while it is a large number , the huge @xmath57-quark background at the lhc will most likely prevent its detection .",
    "note , however , that the maximum fcnc branching ratios are around @xmath58@xmath59 , which is at the same level that the already measured @xmath25 .",
    "the results of the numerical scan for this channel are similar to the @xmath3 channel , so we will focus mainly on the differences .",
    "figure  [ fig : htcprod ] shows the maximum value of the production cross - section @xmath60 as a function of @xmath46 , while table  [ tab : htc - maxims ] shows the actual value of the maximum , together with the susy parameters that provide them , for @xmath61 . only the heavy neutral higgs bosons contribute to this channel .",
    "the general trend explained in section  [ sec : hbs ] is also valid here parameters in the up - sector are related to the corresponding parameters in the down - sector by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , see e.g.@xcite , and are therefore constrained by @xmath25 . ] . from table  [ tab : htc - maxims ] we would expect some 300 events/100@xmath56 at the lhc .",
    "however , the maximum is attained at low @xmath40 , and we have fixed a moderate value of @xmath62 . by taking lower values of @xmath40 we find that the number of events grows fast@xcite , e.g. up to @xmath63 if we would have chosen @xmath64 respectively . due to the single top quark signature",
    "the detection of this channel should be feasible at the lhc .",
    "we have performed a computation of higgs boson mediated fcnc events at the lhc .",
    "alternative effects of susy fcnc have been considered in ref.@xcite . note from eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxleading ] ) that the present effects , though smaller than the latter , do not decouple with @xmath65 . the maximum expected branching ratio for the @xmath3 channel is large , and we expect a maximum of @xmath66 events/100@xmath56 in this channel at the lhc , which might be difficult to detect due to the huge background . for the @xmath67 channel",
    "we expect a maximum of @xmath4 , which means several thousand events per 100@xmath56 at the lhc . due to the single top quark signature",
    "they should be easier to detect than the @xmath3 channel , providing the key to a new door to study physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it is now an experimental challenge to use this key to open the door , and prove that these events can be effectively be separated from the background .",
