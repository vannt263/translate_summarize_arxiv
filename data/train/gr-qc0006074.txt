    "according to an old idea by sakharov @xcite , the gravitational properties of spacetime are caused by the bending stiffness of all quantum fields in a spacetime of scalar curvature @xmath1 .",
    "this idea of induced gravity has inspired many subsequent theories of gravitation , from adler s @xcite proposal to consider einstein gravity as a symmetry breaking effect in quantum field theory to the modern induced gravity derived from string fluctuations @xcite .",
    "whatever the precise mechanism , any induced gravity will lead to a lagrangian which is bounded at large @xmath1 , and may also go to zero",
    ". the latter case would be analogous to the elastic stiffness of solids , which is constant for small distortions , but vanishes after the solid cracks .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the physical consequences of a simple lagrangian which goes to a constant at large @xmath1 , thus interpolating between the einstein - hilbert lagrangian for small @xmath1 and a pure cosmological constant for large @xmath1 .",
    "this lagrangian will be referred to as _ curvature - saturated _ and reads @xmath13 the length parameter @xmath3 may range from an order of the planck length @xmath14 or a few orders of magnitude larger than @xmath14 . applying standard methods and those of refs .",
    "@xcite , we shall derive the cosmological consequences of the saturation and compare our ansatz with others .",
    "one of the motivations for a renewed interest in a more detailed consideration of cosmology with non - linear curvature terms comes from m - theory , see ref .",

    "@xcite contains the latest results concerning the effective @xmath16-term in such models .",
    "our own direct motivation to tackle the model discussed below was as follows : we tried to make the analogy proposed in @xcite more closer than done by others ; the analogy with solid state physics is this one : for small forces , the resistance to bending is proportional to this force , but after a certain threshold  defined by cracking the solid  the resistance vanishes .",

    "qualitatively , the result is : if the radius @xmath17 of the spatial part of spacetime shrinks close to zero , which is almost the same as very large @xmath1 , then the spacings between the energy levels become larger and larger , and after a certain threshold , all fields will be in the ground state .",
    "this behaviour shall be represented by an effective action .",
    "the concrete form of the corresponding effective lagrangian is not yet fully determined ( that shall be the topic of later work ) , but preliminarily we found out that the behaviour for large @xmath1 will quite probably be of a lagrangian bounded by a special effective @xmath16 ; so we have chosen one of the easiest analytic functions possessing this large-@xmath1 behaviour together with the correct weak - field shape .",

    "the physical consequences of these three theories are , of course , quite different since the metrics are not related to each other by coordinate transformations .",

    "however , in the nearby - region where the lagrangian is well approximated by a quadratic function in @xmath1 with a nonvanishing linear term , the behavior of the solutions is quite similar to that of @xmath92-models , where no exact de sitter solution exists , but a quasi de sitter solution represents a transient attractor with sufficient long duration to solve the known cosmological problems .",

    ", the universe goes to the weak - field behavior , where our model behaves as usual .",
    "the main departure of our model from the usual one is in the region of large curvature scalar , where @xmath172 is large compared to @xmath173 . to find out the behavior of the solutions in this limit , we compare the leading terms in eq .",
    "( [ 5.11 ] ) and see that @xmath174 is proportional to @xmath175 , where the coefficient of proportionality is positive and slowly varying .",

    "this implies the existence of a big - bang singularity , but with a different behavior : from eq .",

    "further details of our model will be presented elsewhere .      here",
    "we present the argument with the singularity behaviour mentioned at the end of section ii : in our model , differently from einstein s theory , the divergence of the curvature does not necessarily imply the divergence of any part of the energy - momentum - tensor .",

    "detailed numerical calculations would support this qualitative picture , however , we postpone such calculations until we have a more strictly physically motivated form of the lagrangian .",
    "we have argued that the gravitational action @xmath182 has a decreasing dependence on @xmath1 for increasing @xmath74 .",
    "such a behavior is expected from the spacetime stiffness caused by the vacuum fluctuations of all quantum fields in the universe .",
    "our model does not have the tachyonic disease of @xmath92 models studies by stelle @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "since our model has an action which interpolates between einstein s action and a pure cosmological term , it promises to have interesting observable consequences which may explain some of the experimental cosmological data .",
    "the heat - kernel expansion of the effective action in a curved background is closely related to the seeley - gilkey coefficients @xcite , and for higher loop expansion also higher powers of curvature appear : to get the @xmath52-loop approximation one has to add terms until @xmath183 , a behavior which also happens in the string effective action @xcite .",
    "so , if one cuts this procedure at a certain value of @xmath52 , one gets always as leading term for high curvature values a term like @xmath183 .",
    "however , the @xmath52-loop approximations need not converge to the correct result if one simply takes @xmath184 in the @xmath52-loop - result .",
    "in fact , what we have used in the present paper is such an example : [ 7.1 ] l_cs = = + _ k=1^  b_k  r^2k+1 with some real constants @xmath45 , where [ 7.2 ] b_1 = - but the taylor expansion on the right hand side diverges for @xmath185 .",

    "this is , however , not true , and we show here briefly how to calculate the newtonian limit in a nonflat background , moreover , our approach is different from what is usually called newtonian cosmology . to have a concrete example",

    "all terms represent products of at least @xmath232 small quantities ; because of @xmath228 these are always at least two factors ; thus , they all vanish in the linearization about the minkowski space  time .",
    "now , one might be tempted to require the analogous linearization properties for a friedmann  robertson  walker background .",
    "however , linearization around other than flat space  times is not at all a trivial task , see @xcite , even for einstein s theory : for the closed friedmann model , einstein s theory is linearization unstable , for spatially flat models it is stable , and for the open friedmann model the result is  contrary to other claims in the older literature  not yet known .",
    "we face the further problem that linearization around the de sitter space - time is complicated to determine , because the same geometry can be locally represented as a spatially flat as well as a closed friedmann model .",
    "so , we leave the question of linearization stability with non - flat background of our model unanswered .",
    "another type of reasoning was given quite recently : in @xcite the possibility has been discussed that the contributions to the lagrangian coming of gravitons on the one hand and of gravitinos on the other may cancel each other to avoid the ghost problem .    11 a. sakharov , dokl .",
