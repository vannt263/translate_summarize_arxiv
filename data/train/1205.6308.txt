    "the study of extensions of picard n - stacks has important applications in the theory of motives : for example , in @xcite the first author uses extensions of picard stacks in order to prove deligne s conjecture on extensions of 1-motives ( recall that a 1-motive can be seen as a complex of abelian sheaves of length 2 ) .",
