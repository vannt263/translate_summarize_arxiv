    "it shows that every tunnel can be obtained from the unique tunnel of the trivial knot by a uniquely determined sequence of `` cabling constructions '' .",

    "sections  [ sec : tunnels ] , [ sec : slopedisks ] , and [ sec : cabling ] provide a concise review of the parts of the theory from  @xcite that will be needed in this paper .",
