    "a major part of the current research in mathematical chemistry , chemical graph theory and quantative structure - activity - property relationship qsar / qspr studies involves topological indices .",

    ". these indices are graph invariants which usually characterize the topology of that molecular graph .",
    "some major classes of topological indices such as distance - based topological indices , connectivity topological indices and counting related polynomials and indices of graphs have found remarkable employment in several chemistry fields .",
    "the first non - trivial distance - based topological index was wiener index , introduced by wiener in 1947 @xcite . to explain various chemical and physical properties of atoms , molecules , and to correlate the structure of molecules to their biological activity",
    ", wiener index plays a significant role @xcite .",
    "caused by this usefulness of the wiener index , the research interest in wiener index and related distance - based indices is still considerable . in the last twenty years , surprisingly a large number of modifications and extensions of the wiener index such as schultz index @xmath5 , proposed by schultz @xcite ; szeged index @xmath6 , proposed by gutman @xcite ; revised wiener or revised szeged index @xmath7 proposed by randi @xcite ; modified wiener index for trees @xmath8 , proposed by nikoli _",

    "_ @xcite and baladan index @xmath11 , proposed by baladan @xcite and by randi @xcite , to name a few , was put forward and studied . an extensive bibliography on this matter",
    "can be found in the reviews @xcite .",
    "the problems on distance in graphs continues to seek the attention of scientists both as theory and applications . among these problems ,",
    "the most famous problem in graphs , which plays a vital role to uniquely distinguish all the vertices of a graph , is resolvability . roughly speaking , by resolvability in a graph @xmath1 ,",
    "we mean that any two vertices of @xmath1 in the pair @xmath12 are said to be uniquely distinguished ( represented or resolved ) by a vertex @xmath13 of @xmath1 if the distance between @xmath14 and @xmath13 is distinct from the distance between @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath1 needed to distinguish all the pairs of the vertices of @xmath1 form a remarkable set known as a resolving set for @xmath1 , and it has a significant application in pharmaceutical chemistry .    a fundamental problem in pharmaceutical chemistry is to find out the unique representations of chemical compounds in several molecular structures ( graphs ) .",
    "the intention behind uniquely representing the chemical compounds is to determine whether any two compounds in the structure share the same functional group at a particular position .",
    "this comparative statement plays a fundamental part in drug discovery whenever it is to be determined whether the features of a chemical compound are responsible for its pharmacological activity @xcite .",
    "the solution of this fundamental problem was addressed by the concept of resolving set . a minimum resolving set is , in fact , the set of those few atoms in a molecular graph which determine the unique representations of the chemical compounds .",
    "now , a question with remarkable interest arises that _ how much an atom of a molecular graph partake in uniquely representing any pair of chemical compounds?_. precisely , in a graph @xmath1 , how much a vertex of @xmath1 involves itself to resolve any pair of vertices of @xmath1 ? in this paper",
    ", we fix this problem by defining the amount of resolving done by an atom ( vertex ) to represent ( resolve ) every pair of compounds of a molecular graph , and is called the resolving share of that atom . with the help of resolving share of each atom ,",
    "a numeric identity is associated with the molecular graph , called the resolving topological index , which reflects the total amount of resolving done by the atoms in that molecular graph .    under a `` molecular graph ''",
    "we understand a simple graph , representing the atom skeleton of molecules ( chemical compounds ) .",
    "thus the vertices of a molecular graph represents the atoms and edges the atom - atom bonds .",
    "let @xmath1 be a non - trivial connected graph with vertex set @xmath16 and edge set @xmath17 .",
    "we write @xmath18 if two vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 are adjacent ( form an edge ) in @xmath1 and write @xmath19 if they are non - adjacent ( do not form an edge ) .",
    "the join of two graphs @xmath20 and @xmath21 , denoted by @xmath22 , is a graph with vertex set @xmath23 and an edge set @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , between two vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 of @xmath1 is defined as the length of a shortest @xmath27 path in @xmath1 , where length is the number of edges in the path .",
    "the _ diameter _ of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath28 , is the maximum distance between any two vertices of @xmath1 .",
    "we refer @xcite for the general graph theoretic notations and terminologies not described in this paper .",
    "a vertex @xmath14 of @xmath1 _ resolves _ two distinct vertices @xmath15 and @xmath13 of @xmath1 if @xmath29 .",
    "a set @xmath30 is called a _ resolving set _ for @xmath1 if every two distinct vertices of @xmath1 are resolved by some elements of @xmath31 .",
    "such a set @xmath31 with minimum cardinality is called a _ metric basis _ , or simply a _ basis _ of @xmath1 and that minimum cardinality is called the _ metric dimension _ of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "obviously , the metric dimension of a graph @xmath1 is a topological index that suggests those minimum number of vertices of @xmath1 which uniquely determine all the vertices of @xmath1 by their shortest distances to the chosen vertices .",
    "the concept of resolving set was first introduced in the 1970s , by slater @xcite and , independently , by harary and melter @xcite .",
    "slater described the usefulness of this idea into long range aids to navigation @xcite .",
    "moreover , this concept has some applications in chemistry for representing chemical compounds @xcite and in problems of pattern recognition and image processing , some of which involve the use of hierarchical data structures @xcite .",
    "other applications of this concept to navigation of robots in networks and other areas appear in @xcite . in recent years",
