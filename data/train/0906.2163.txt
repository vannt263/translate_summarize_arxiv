    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are dense spherical collection of stars orbiting around the galactic center containing a significant number of binary stars .",
    "the first millisecond radio pulsar was discovered in a gc m28 only in 1987 @xcite and gcs in general were regarded as spun - up pulsar nurseries @xcite .",
    "how old and evolved stellar systems like gcs can contain apparently young , active objects like pulsars have led to suggestions , based on lifetime constraints from orbital decay by gravitational radiation @xcite , that some of these systems have formed recently , or are forming even today .",
    "interaction between binary stars and single stars in gcs is believed to be an important dynamical process as the resulting binary systems may provide a substantial source of energy for the gcs , as the binding energies of a few , very close binaries ( like neutron star binaries ) can approach that of a moderately massive host gc @xcite .",
    "although the importance there is due to exchange of energy , interesting constraints and conclusions can be derived about lifetimes of binaries from the rate at which their orbital eccentricity is changed by encounter with other stars .",
    "a key aspect here is that the orbital eccentricities of binary millisecond radio pulsars can be measured with extraordinary precision .",
    "pulsar spin - up and recycling are thought to be enhanced in globular clusters by binary - single star interactions .",
    "this is because binary interactions can increase the cross section for recycling processes and weaken the stellar density dependence of the probability of a neutron star without visible radio pulses evolving into a reborn pulsar after the ( binary ) interaction @xcite .",
    "after the interaction some of the pulsars may be ejected from the core of the cluster or even from the gc altogether , and their distributions of orbital properties can be predicted in terms of the interaction model .",
    "thus , observable parameters of the neutron stars and their binary companions in globular clusters , such as spin , orbital period and eccentricity , projected radial position in the cluster , companion mass and their distributions provide a tracer of the past history of dynamical interactions of the binary nss in individual gcs .",
    "these parameters can even provide a valuable test - bed to examine the theoretical scenarios of formation and evolution of recycled pulsars . among the different types of neutron star binaries ,",
    "binary radio pulsars can be timed more easily and accurately by ground - based telescopes over well - separated epochs , as the underlying neutron stars are less prone to noise than in the case of x - ray pulsars which have episodically varying accretion torques .",
    "these lead to the easier measurement of orbital parameters .",
    "eccentric millisecond pulsar binaries can also be important probes of neutron star physics since they provide a way to constrain the masses of the fully - recycled pulsars .",
    "pulsar timing can measure the orbital advance of the periastron of the elliptical orbit ; this advance is dominated by general relativistic effects if the companion star is a compact one , and can determine the total mass of the system .",
    "the recycling scenario creates binary millisecond pulsars in circular orbits as during the accretion phase there is a strong tidal coupling leading to orbit circularization .",
    "therefore , the eccentric systems of fully recycled ( millisecond period ) pulsar binaries found in globular clusters are produced only through stellar interactions where density of stars is high @xcite .    till today , a total of 140 pulsars in 26 gcspfreire / gcpsr.html , compiled from radio timing observations by many groups .",
    "] have been discovered . among them",
    "74 are known as binaries ( in 23 gcs ) , 59 are known as isolated and 7 have no published timing / orbital solutions . in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on binaries . for one of them ( psr j2140@xmath02310b in m30 ) ,",
    "orbital parameters are not well determined , only lower limit of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are known as @xmath3 days and @xmath4 .",
    "so we exclude it from our analysis and the total number of pulsars in become 73 .",
    "we study the distribution of these 73 pulsars in the orbital eccentricity - period plane with analytical results and our numerical experiments of scattering of stars simulated by direct n - body integration tools .",
    "the corresponding distribution of some of these observables for neutron star binaries in the galactic field e.g. in the orbital eccentricity and period plane have some significant differences . we discuss below these differences in the light of interaction of stars with binaries already formed or in the process of formation inside globular clusters , due to the high stellar density in their cores compared to that of the galactic disk .    this article is in continuation of our preliminary work in this area @xcite and provides further details and extensions .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : data ] we discuss the characteristics of the presently available binary radio pulsar data and how they occupy different regions of the orbital phase space . here",
    "we include both gc pulsars and disk pulsars as the later class was not considered in the earlier paper @xcite .",
    "note that in fig 1 , 2 and 5 , we plot the gc and galactic disk pulsars irrespective of their spins .",
    "our conclusions are not significantly affected if we restrict the sample to @xmath5 ms pulsars which were more likely to have undergone atleast mild recycling .",
    "details of methodology and notations have been discussed in section [ sec : types_int ] which were not provided in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "section 3 is further subdivided into   [ sec : fly_by ] for fly - by and   [ sec : starlab ] for exchange and merger interactions .",
    "we report the details of the starlab runs used to simulate binary - single stars scattering and provide outputs for some of those runs @xmath6 .",
    "cross - sections of different interactions for different stellar parameters , eccentricity - orbital period distribution after exchange / merger interactions @xmath7 .",
    "next , in section [ sec : ion ] we have a discussion on the role of ionization in affecting the distribution of pulsar characteristics where we show that ionization at present can not be responsible for the lack of long period binaries in the observed gcs . in section [ sec : disc ]",
    "we discuss our analytical and computational results in relation to the available data and in section [ sec : conclu ] we give our conclusions .",
    "we summarize the relevant properties of the host gcs @xcite and binary pulsars therein in tables [ tb : gc_v_n ] and [ tab : psr_parms ] respectively . in fig",
    "[ fig : compare_gc_gal ] , we plot @xmath2 vs @xmath1 for all the binary pulsars with known orbital solutions .",
    "purple @xmath8s are for globular cluster binaries and red @xmath9s are for disk binaries .",
    "a logarithmic scale in both eccentricity and orbital periods are chosen , as the enormous range of both variables and the regions occupied by observed pulsars are less obvious in linear scales days such as ( i ) psr j0823 + 0159 with @xmath10 days , @xmath11 , ( ii ) psr j1302 - 6350 with @xmath12 days , @xmath13 , ( iii ) psr j1638 - 4725 with @xmath14 days , @xmath15 .",
    "these are excluded from our graph as we choose the range of @xmath1 up to 1000 days because our main concern , globular cluster binaries have always @xmath16 days . ] .",
    "note that 10 gc binary pulsars have only upper limits to their eccentricities ( see table [ tab : psr_parms ] ) .",
    "in addition , one _ galactic disk _ binary pulsar psr j1744 - 3922 ( @xmath17 days ) also has only an upper limit to the eccentricity of @xmath18 . observed binaries in gcs can be categorized in three groups : ( i ) large eccentricity pulsars ( @xmath19 ) , 21 pulsars ( 22 if we include m30b ) , ( ii ) moderate eccentricity pulsars ( @xmath20 ) , 20 pulsars and ( iii ) small eccentricity pulsars ( @xmath21 ) , 32 pulsars . in the database ,",
    "orbital eccentricities of group ( iii ) pulsars have been listed as zero , and in this logarithmic plot we assign them an arbitrarily small value of @xmath22 . actually for these binaries , it is difficult to measure the eccentricities with present day timing accuracy .",
    "this gives a limit to the minimum eccentricity which can be measured as a function of orbital period as given by phinney ( 1992 ) :    @xmath23 \\label{eq : timing_sensitivity1}\\ ] ]    giving @xmath24}\\frac{\\delta t } { p_{orb}^{2/3 } } \\label{eq : timing_sensitivity2}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the inclination angle of the binary , @xmath26 is the angle between the line of nodes and the line of apsides , @xmath27 is the pulsar mass , @xmath28 is the companion mass and @xmath29 is the timing accuracy .",
    "we call equation ( [ eq : timing_sensitivity2 ] ) as the  limit of timing sensitivity \" and is shown as the solid line in the lower left corner of fig [ fig : compare_gc_gal ] taking @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "in addition we plot on the right of fig 1 , dashed lines corresponding to the freeze - out eccentricity - orbital period relation predicted by phinney ( 1992 ) on the basis of the fluctuation dissipation theorem for convective eddies in the erstwhile red giant envelopes surrounding the white - dwarf cores which end up as companions of the neutron stars .",
    "this relation is obtained from the following expression : @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the orbital angular rotation frequency , @xmath36 is the semi - major axis of the binary , @xmath2 is the orbital eccentricity , l is the luminosity of the companion , @xmath37 is the radius of the companion , @xmath38 is the envelop mass of the companion , @xmath27 is the pulsar mass , @xmath28 is the companion mass and @xmath39 is the reduced mass of the system .",
    "phinney used @xmath40 when the mass transfer ceases and @xmath2 freezes .",
    "then the above equation reduces to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a function of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath1 is the orbital period in days .",
    "phinney ( 1992 ) calculated @xmath45 using average values of @xmath38 and @xmath43 for population i stars ( @xmath46 ) @xcite .",
    "however for globular clusters , population ii stars are more appropriate .",
    "so we recalculated @xmath42 for population ii red giant stars which in general are smaller than population i stars of similar mass and evolutionary stage , and their binary orbital periods at roche lobe overflow and subsequent mass transfer are shorter than population i red giant binaries @xcite .",
    "we thus obtained @xmath47 .",
    "this line is plotted as the lower dashed green line in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_gc_gal ] .",
    "the galactic field pulsars in the phase space of fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_gc_gal ] are also shown here .",
    "observational selection effects may be influencing the distribution seen in this figure for the two sets @xcite , the most important selection effect being operative towards the left of the diagram , namely , it is more difficult to detect pulsars with larger dm and/or shorter periods , especially millisecond pulsars in very short orbital period and highly eccentric binaries ; distance to the pulsars also is an important selection effect , since at large distance only the brightest pulsars can be observed ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that there is a large abundance of pulsars with long orbital periods and intermediate eccentricity near the eddy  fluctuation dissipation \" lines among the _ galactic disk _ pulsars which are absent in the gc pulsar population , where the important selection effects are unlikely to play a major role .",
    "other than this , the galactic disk pulsars by and large seem to follow the above three groupings for gc pulsars .",
    "the observed preponderance of double neutron star binaries in the field pulsars among the very short orbital period and large eccentricity orbits may be related to selection effects ( see above ) , but we note that there is at least one dns binary among the gc system : psr j2127 + 1105c in m15 in this group ( the galactic field dns binary pulsars are by and large at small distances while m15 and other host gcs are usually far away ) ( 2008 ) .",
    "the case for the eccentricity distribution of galactic disk double neutron star ( dns ) binaries has been considered by ihm , kalogera & belczynski ( 2006 ) . since these systems are the result of evolution of massive stars in binary systems , if they formed directly in gcs , they would have formed early in the life of a gc , since the lifetime of a massive star ( @xmath48 ) is of the order of only @xmath49 myr .",
    "most binaries that have one component forming a neutron star are disrupted in the process of the ns formation , especially those that are in low mass systems , but those that survive tend to have progenitor binaries that were rather tightly bound and subsequent binary - single encounter mostly harden the ns binary .",
    "ivanova @xmath50 ( 2008 ) find only 14 dnss were formed dynamically during the 11 gyr for all the 70 models of gc population synthesis they consider , most of these would have formed in ter 5 .",
    "the only known case of a dns in a gc is however that of m15 psr b2127 + 1105c .",
    "psr j0514 - 4002a is a 5-ms pulsar is located in the globular cluster ngc 1851 ; it belongs to a highly eccentric ( e = 0.888 ) binary system , but the massive companion here may be a white dwarf rather than a neutron star ( freiere , ransom & gupta 2008 ) . ] .",
    "we have also performed a cluster analysis test using the statistical software  _ r _ \" for globular cluster binary pulsars .",
    "here we assign random eccentricities of the group iii ( very low eccentricity ) pulsars in such a way that they remain below the  limit of timing sensitivity \" line .",
    "performing a k - means test with 3 clusters , we got 3 clusters of sizes 21 ( high eccentricity ) , 18 ( medium eccentricity ) and 34 ( low eccentricity ) with the sum of squares from points to the assigned cluster centers as 19.92446 , 10.21016 and 13.25632 respectively whereas the squares of inter - cluster distances are as follows @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this indicates that the three groupings referred to above are statistically separate cluster of objects .",
    "formation scenario of binary millisecond pulsars suggests that their eccentricity should be very small , @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "but there are many eccentric millisecond pulsars inside globular clusters which are likely to be due to interactions of the binary pulsars with single stars provided the interaction timescale is less than the binary age .",
    "we take the maximum age of the binaries in a gc to be the globular cluster ages which are close to @xmath55 years . in subsequent sections ,",
    "we study different types of stellar interactions and their effect on orbital eccentricities and periods .",
    "we include where relevant , the effects of gravitational radiation on these phase space variables .",
    "globular clusters contain a large number of low mass x - ray binaries compared to the galactic field ; this had led to the suggestion @xcite that a binary is formed by tidal capture of a non - compact star by a neutron star in the dense stellar environment of the gc cores .",
    "if mass and angular momentum transfer from the companion to the neutron star took place in a stable manner , this could lead to recycled pulsars in binaries or as single millisecond pulsars ( e.g. alpar @xmath56 1982 , romani @xmath57 1987 , verbunt @xmath57 1987 ) .",
    "however large energies may be deposited in tides after tidal capture of a neutron star by a low mass main sequence star in a gc .",
    "the resultant structural readjustments of the star in response to the dissipation of the modes could be very significant in stars with either convective or radiative damping zones ( ray , kembhavi & antia 1987 ; mcmillan , mcdermott & taam 1987 ) and the companion star can undergo a size  inflation \" due to its high tidal luminosity which may exceed that induced by nuclear reactions in the core , by a large factor .",
    "efficiency of viscous dissipation and orbit evolution is crucial to the subsequent evolution of the system as viscosity regulates the growth of oscillations and the degree to which the extended star is bloated and shed .",
    "the evolution of the system could lead to either a merger ( leading to a thorne zytkow object ) or a neutron star surrounded by a massive disk comprising of the stellar debris of its erstwhile companion or , in other cases , a low mass x - ray binary or a even detached binary following envelope ejection .",
    "tidal oscillation energy can also be _ returned _ to the orbit ( i.e. the tide orbit coupling is a dynamical effect ) thus affecting the orbit evolution or the extent of dissipative heating in the less dense companion . the evolutionary transition from initial tidal dynamics to any likely final ,",
    "quiescent binary system is thus regulated by viscosity .",
    "tide orbit coupling can even lead to chaotic evolution of the orbit in some cases @xcite but in the presence of dissipation with non - liner damping , the chaotic phase may last only for about 200 yr after which the binary may undergo a periodic circularization and after about 5 myr finish circularizing @xcite .",
    "of the stars that do not directly lead to mergers , a roughly equal fraction of the encounters lead to binaries that either become unbound as a result of de - excitation or heating from other stars in the vicinity or they are scattered into orbits with large pericenters ( compared to the size of the non - compact star ) due to angular momentum transfer from other stars @xcite .",
    "thus kochanek s  intermediate pericenter \" encounters can lead to widened orbit ( even 100 days orbital period in an eccentric orbit ) in tidal encounters involving main sequence stars and neutron stars , which in the standard scenario are attributed to encounters between giants and neutron stars .",
    "the complexities of the dynamics of tidal capture and subsequent evolution are manifold and attempts to numerically simulate collisions of neutron stars with red giants have been made with 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) codes ( e.g. rasio & shapiro 1991 , davis , benz & hills 1991 ) .",
    "we note in this context that podsiadlowski , rappaport & pfahl ( 2002 ) have stated  it is not only premature to rule out tidal capture as a formation scenario for lmxbs , but that lmxbs in globular clusters with well determined orbital periods actually provide observational evidence in its favor \" .",
    "the different formation channels of pulsars in binaries in gcs and the birthrate problems of millisecond pulsar binaries vs lmxbs were considered in @xcite .    until the early eighties there was no evidence of a substantial population of primordial binaries in any globular clusters , and it was even thought that gcs are significantly deficient in binaries compared to a younger galactic population @xcite",
    ". theoretical modeling of gcs was often started off as if all stars were singles . during the 1980s",
    "several observational techniques began to yield a rich population of binary stars in gcs ( see bassa @xmath56 2008 , yan & mateo 1994 , pryor @xmath56 1989 ) .",
    "when the local binary fraction is substantial , the single star - binary interaction can exceed the encounter rate between single stars by a large factor @xcite .",
    "the existence of a significant population of primordial binary population in gcs indicated that three body processes have to be accounted for in any dynamical study of binaries involving compact stars .",
    "an encounter between a field star and a binary may lead to a change of state of the latter , e.g. : i ) the original binary may undergo a change of eccentricity and orbital period but otherwise remain intact  a  preservation \" or a  fly - by \" process ; ii ) a member of the binary may be exchanged with the incoming field star , forming a new binary  an  exchange \" process ; iii ) two of the stars may collide and merge into a single object , and may or may not remain bound to the third star - a  merger \" process ; iv ) three of the stars may collide and merge into a single object - a  triple merger \" process ; v ) all three stars are unbound from an orbit - an  ionization \" process .",
    "the ionization is always a  prompt \" process , whereas the others can be either prompt or  resonant \" process . in resonant processes ,",
    "the stars form a temporarily bound triple system , with a negative total energy but which decays into an escaping star and a binary , typically after 10 - 100 crossing times .",
    "the value of the binding energy of the binary and the velocity of the incoming star determine the type of interaction the binary will encounter .",
    "the critical velocity @xmath58 of the incoming star , for which the total energy ( kinetic plus potential ) of the three body system is zero , can be defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the masses of the binary members , @xmath62 is the mass of the incoming star , @xmath63 is the semi - major axis of the binary and g is the gravitational constant .    in case of a binary - single star interaction ,",
    "semi major axis of the final binary ( @xmath64 ) is related to the semi major axis of the initial binary ( @xmath63 ) as follows ( sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) : @xmath65 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are masses of the members of the initial binary , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are masses of the members of the final binary .",

    "similar expressions can be derived for other cases @xmath81 star 1 is being replaced by star 3 or star 1 being merged with star 3 .",
    "but in the present work , we always assume star 1 to be the neutron star , so to get binary radio pulsar these latter two processes have to be rejected .    interactions between binaries and single stars can enhance the eccentricity of the binary orbit and this will be discussed in detail in the subsequent sections . on the other hand ,",
    "binary pulsars emit gravitational waves which reduce both the size and eccentricity of the orbit leading to mergers on a timescale of @xmath82 .",
    "following peters & mathews ( 1963 ) , @xmath82 can be calculated as follows :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 which is almost same as the expression of @xmath82 calculated from @xmath86 .",

    "rasio and heggie @xcite studied the change of orbital eccentricity of an initially circular binary following a distant encounter with a third star in a parabolic orbit .",

    "but the first one is a normal pulsar with @xmath121 sec and as it is not spun up and may not have been subject to a great deal of tidal forces , it can have escaped circularization . on the other hand ,",
    "the second pulsar is a millisecond pulsar with @xmath122 ms , so it should have been in a circular orbit if it has not had the time to go through any significant kind of stellar interactions .",
    "therefore it is of interest to investigate if it is a result of an exchange or merger interaction .",
    "moreover , some of the eccentric pulsars which seem to be explainable by fly - by interactions lie outside of globular cluster cores ( which have less stellar density than in the core , and therefore less efficient fly - by scattering ) . for a few others",
    "positional offsets are not known . even if a pulsar appears to be inside the cluster core in the projected image , it can still be outside the cluster core in three dimensional space .",
    "globular cluster models show that values of both @xmath104 and @xmath102 fall outwards from cluster center and as the fall of @xmath102 is much more rapid , the value of @xmath123 is higher outside the cluster core . as we have already seen ( different panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : psr_all_group_rasio_fly ] ) that an increase in the value of @xmath123 shifts the contour of @xmath124 years rightwards , this will make the pulsar fall in the region where @xmath125 years excluding the possibility of fly - by interaction as the cause of its eccentricity . in those cases also , we need to think about exchange and/or merger interactions .",
    "another aspect of the pulsar population in these diagrams is that the long orbital period pulsars are found predominantly in low density ( and high velocity dispersion ) gcs , a feature that has been noticed before @xcite .",
    "camilo & rasio ( 2005 ) also point out that while the lmxbs are predominantly found in very dense gcs , the radio pulsars tend to be found more evenly distributed among low and high density clusters , as also seen in the great deal of variation of the @xmath123 parameter in the various plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : psr_all_group_rasio_fly ] .",
    "we have seen that there are many zero eccentricity pulsars which lie in the region where @xmath126 years .",
    "so it is of interest to understand why they still appear in circular orbits despite the possibility of fly - by interactions .",
    "it is possible however that , firstly the binaries may be very young so that they have not had enough time to interact with single stars .",
    "secondly , they may in fact lie outside cluster cores with a higher @xmath123 even though in projection many of them may appear to be inside the cores so that the timescale for fly - by is actually @xmath125 years .",

    "there are a number of pulsars for which position offsets are not known .",
    "also the binaries which appear to be inside the cluster core in the projected plane can actually lie outside the core .",
    "the observed values of spin period derivatives ( @xmath127 ) of the globular cluster pulsars can give some indication of the pulsar position and its environment since negative or positive @xmath127 indicate positions in the back half or in the front half of the cluster respectively @xcite ; however , the actual position can not be determined with the knowledge of @xmath127 only .",
    "dm measure could also be a tool to measure pulsar positions with respect to cluster center if dm variations were dominated by intra - cluster gas @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that for terzan 5 , dm is mainly due to ism ( ransom2006 ) , so dm values alone can not help to determine pulsar positions with respect to the center for this cluster .",

    "camilo & rasio ( 2005 ) discussed the dynamical formation of ultra - compact binaries involving intermediate mass main sequence stars in the early life of the gc as the origin of the group iii pulsars .",
    "these companions must have been massive enough ( beyond the present day cluster turn - off mass of @xmath213 ) so that the initial mass transfer became dynamically unstable , leading to common envelope evolution and subsequent orbital decay and circularization . alternately , the present day red giant and ns collisions lead to a prompt disruption of the red giant envelope and the system ends up as eccentric ns - wd binary @xcite",
    ". these binaries could decay to the group iii pulsars by gravitational radiation if they had short @xmath214 .    despite the circumstance that most radio pulsars in gcs can be explained by fly - by and/or exchange interactions",
    ", there exists a pulsar like the psr b1639 + 36b ( i.e. m13b ) which is a recycled pulsar and in a region of the phase space that is difficult to reach with either fly - by or exchange mechanisms .",
    "systems like this could have undergone eccentricity pumping of the inner orbit due to the presence of a third star in a wide outer orbit , i.e. in a hierarchical triplet like the psr b1620 - 26 in m4 system @xcite .",
    "rasio @xmath56 ( 1995 ) showed that only one such triple system can form in a globular cluster like m4 , but in clusters with higher values of @xmath102 and/or binary fraction the number can be a few , though at present psr b1620 - 26 is the only known triple system in globular clusters .",
    "a similar mechanism has been suggested recently @xcite for a galactic disk binary pulsar psr j1903 + 0327 , a radio pulsar with a rotational period of 2.15 milliseconds in a highly eccentric ( e = 0.44 ) 95-day orbit around a solar mass companion star .",
    "the formation scenarios for such an unusual pulsar both in and out of gcs , and in particular the observational consequences for further radio timing of psr j1903 + 0327 in terms of eccentricity pumping taking account of relativistic precession of the inner orbit periastron , has been investigated @xcite .",
    "we find that the presently observed orbital eccentricity and period data of gc binary pulsars are largely explained by numerical scattering experiments on stellar interaction scenarios of fly - bys and exchanges with field stars .",
    "binaries with @xmath215 are most probably the result of exchange or merger events whereas binaries with @xmath216 are products of fly - by of single stars .",
    "a number of wide orbit intermediate eccentricity pulsars seen in the galactic field are absent in the gc sample because they have been kicked up to relatively high eccentricities by passing stars in the dense stellar environments in gcs . in some gcs such as ter 5",
    ", the stellar densities are so high , and the velocity dispersion so modest that the interaction timescale for exchange and fly - by interactions is relatively short . in such gcs a typical binary system may undergo multiple interactions . if the original binary contains a spun - up millisecond pulsar in a relatively  soft \" binary , then the exchange interaction may produce a single millisecond pulsar in the cluster .",
    "this may explain the higher incidence of single ms psrs in gcs compared to that in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "terzan 5 , for example , contains 16 single ms psrs out of a total of 33 pulsars .",
    "in addition , exchange interactions , as we have seen , can lead to highly eccentric orbits and the system can be ejected from the cluster core . if the last encounter took place not too long ago , the system can be at a relatively large offset from the cluster core , albeit being still spatially co - located with the gc .",
    "it is however clear that there are systems in gcs whose orbital characteristics can not be explained by purely episodic interactions ; an example of this kind is psr b1620 - 26 , which is a hierarchical triplet , whose pulsar orbital eccentricity is affected by the presence of a third star in a loosely bound system .",
    "there are possibly other examples of a similar kind where there is eccentricity pumping from the long term presence of companions in a triplet system .",
    "we have also considered the effects of collision induced ionization on the present day distribution of orbital parameters of radio pulsars in gcs . in the galactic disk",
    "we find that there exist several pulsars with @xmath217 ( although some of them have more massive companions than the pulsar binaries in the gcs ) , while the similar wide orbit binaries are missing from the gcs . while it is tempting to speculate that these are missing from the present day gcs because they have been ionized in the past , we find that the ionization probability becomes substantial only in a restricted domain of masses of the companion and incoming stars , and that too for essentially periods greater than @xmath218",
    ". binary pulsars with very low companion masses can be ionized easily . on the other hand the apparent lack of the corresponding examples of galactic disk long orbital period binaries surviving due to their massive companions in gcs",
    "could also be due to observational selection effects . while ionization interaction can explain lack of binary pulsars with @xmath218 in globular clusters , this process is currently not important , but could have played a role in the past for very long period binaries . on the other hand",
    "there are somewhat wide binaries in the present day gcs with moderately high eccentricities ( e.g. @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) which could have arisen out of fly - by exchanges from progenitor binaries with  relic \" eccentricities @xmath219 .",
    "many galactic disk binary pulsars are seen in the @xmath108 plane predicted by phinney due to the fluctuation dissipation of convective eddies and the resultant orbital eccentricities that are induced .",
    "these pulsars are missing from the gc sample .",
    "there is no reason not to expect these systems to form in the gcs ( although due to the lower metallicity of the stellar companions in gcs , they are expected to lead to somewhat less wide systems @xcite ) .",
