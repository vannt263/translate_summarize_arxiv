    "at the conference `` contemporary developments in mathematics '' , hosted by the mit and harvard university mathematics departments , november 16 - 17 , 2001 , one of us ( e.h.l . ) contributed a talk with the above title .",
    "it was a review of our work @xcite on the mathematical foundations of classical thermodynamics .",
    "an extensive summary of @xcite was published in the ams notices @xcite .",
    "it was also published in @xcite and @xcite with additional sections added in each . a shorter summary , addressed particularily to physicists , appeared in physics today @xcite .",
    "we include here an expanded version of the article @xcite .",
    "section [ sec1 ] is primarily from @xcite but is augmented by proofs of all theorems .",
    "the present version is therefore mathematically complete , but the original paper @xcite is recommended for additional insights and extensive discussions .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is primarily from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is mainly from @xcite .",
    "this article is intended for readers who , like us , were told that the second law of thermodynamics is one of the major achievements of the nineteenth century , that it is a logical , perfect and unbreakable law  but who were unsatisfied with the ` derivations ' of the entropy principle as found in textbooks and in popular writings .",
    "a glance at the books will inform the reader that the law has ` various formulations ' ( which is a bit odd for something so fundamental ) but they all lead to the existence of an entropy function whose reason for existence is to tell us which processes can occur and which can not .",
    "an interesting summary of these various points of view is in @xcite .",
    "contrary to convention , we shall refer to the existence of entropy as _ the _ second law .",
    "this , at least , is unambiguous .",
    "the entropy we are talking about is that defined by thermodynamics ( and _ not _ some analytic quantity , usually involving expressions such as @xmath2 , that appears in information theory , probability theory and statistical mechanical models ) .",
    "why , one might ask , should a mathematician be interested in the second law of thermodynamics which , historically , had something to do with attempts to understand and improve the efficiency of steam engines ?",
    "the answer , as we perceive it , is that the law is really an interesting mathematical theorem about orderings on sets , with profound physical implications .",
    "the axioms that constitute this ordering are somewhat peculiar from the mathematical point of view and might not arise in the ordinary ruminations of abstract thought .",
    "they are special , but important , and they are driven by considerations about the world , which is what makes them so interesting .",
    "maybe an ingenious reader will find an application of this same logical structure to another field of science .",
    "classical thermodynamics , as it is usually presented , is based on three laws ( plus one more , due to nernst , which is mainly used in low temperature physics and is not immutable like the others ) . in brief , these are :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -- _ the zeroth law , _ which expresses the transitivity of equilibrium , and which is often said to imply the existence of temperature as a parametrization of equilibrium states .",
    "we use it below but formulate it without mentioning temperature .",
    "in fact , temperature makes no appearance here until almost the very end .",
    "_ the first law , _ which is conservation of energy .",
    "it is a concept from mechanics and provides the connection between mechanics ( and things like falling weights ) and thermodynamics .",
    "we discuss this later on when we introduce simple systems ; the crucial usage of this law is that it allows energy to be used as one of the parameters describing the states of a simple system .    _ the second law . _ three popular formulations of this law are :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ clausius : _ no process is possible , the sole result of which is that heat is transferred from a body to a hotter one .",
    "_ kelvin ( and planck ) _ : no process is possible , the sole result of which is that a body is cooled and work is done .",
    "_ carathodory _ : in any neighborhood of any state there are states that can not be reached from it by an adiabatic process .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    -- _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    all three are supposed to lead to the entropy principle ( defined below ) .",
    "these steps can be found in many books and will not be trodden again here .",
    "let us note in passing , however , that the first two use concepts such as hot , cold , heat , cool , that are intuitive but have to be made precise before the statements are truly meaningful .",
    "no one has seen ` heat ' , for example .",
    "the last ( which uses the term ",
    "adiabatic process , to be defined below ) presupposes some kind of parametrization of states by points in @xmath3 , and the usual derivation of entropy from it assumes some sort of differentiability ; such assumptions are beside the point as far as understanding the meaning of entropy goes .",
    "the basic input in our analysis of the second law is a certain kind of ordering on a set and denoted by @xmath4 ( pronounced ` precedes ' ) .",
    "it is transitive and reflexive as in a1 , a2 below , but @xmath5 and @xmath6 does not imply @xmath7 , so it is a ` preorder ' . the big question is whether @xmath8 can be encoded in an ordinary , real - valued function on the set , denoted by @xmath0 , such that if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related by @xmath8 , then @xmath11 if and only if @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath0 is also required to be additive and extensive in a sense that will soon be made precise .",
    "a helpful analogy is the question : when can a vector - field , @xmath12 , on @xmath13 be encoded in an ordinary function , @xmath14 , whose gradient is @xmath15 ?",
    "the well - known answer is that a necessary and sufficient condition is that @xmath16 . once @xmath15",
    "is observed to have this property one thing becomes evident and important : it is necessary to measure the integral of @xmath15 only along some curves  not all curves  in order to deduce the integral along _ all _ curves .",
    "the encoding then has enormous predictive power about the nature of future measurements of @xmath15 . in the same way ,",
    "knowledge of the function @xmath0 has enormous predictive power in the hands of chemists , engineers and others concerned with the ways of the physical world .",
    "our concern will be the existence and properties of @xmath0 , starting from certain natural axioms about the relation @xmath8 .",
    "we present our results with slightly abridged versions of some proofs , but full details , and a discussion of related previous work on the foundations of classical thermodynamics , are given in @xcite .",
    "the literature on this subject is extensive and it is not possible to give even a brief account of it here , except for mentioning that the previous work closest to ours is that of @xcite , and @xcite , ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "( the situation is summarized more completely in @xcite . )",
    "these other approaches are also based on an investigation of the relation @xmath8 , but the overlap with our work is only partial .",
    "in fact , a major part of our work is the derivation of a certain property ( the  comparison hypothesis  below ) , which is taken as an axiom in the other approaches .",
    "it was a remarkable and largely unsung achievement of giles @xcite to realize the full power of this property .",
    "let us begin the story with some basic concepts .",
    "* _ thermodynamic system _ : physically , this consists of certain specified amounts of certain kinds of matter , e.g. , a gram of hydrogen in a container with a piston , or a gram of hydrogen and a gram of oxygen in two separate containers , or a gram of hydrogen and two grams of hydrogen in separate containers .",
    "the system can be in various states which , physically , are _",
    "equilibrium states_. the space of states of the system is usually denoted by a symbol such as @xmath17 and states in @xmath17 by @xmath18 etc .",
    "physical motivation aside , a state - space , mathematically , is just a set  to begin with ; later on we will be interested in embedding state - spaces in some convex subset of some @xmath19 , i.e. , we will introduce coordinates . as we said earlier",
    ", however , the entropy principle is quite independent of coordinatization , carathodory s principle notwithstanding .    * _ composition and scaling of states _ : the notion of cartesian product , @xmath20 corresponds simply to the two ( or more ) systems being side by side on the laboratory table ; mathematically it is just another system ( called a _ compound system _ ) , and we regard the state space @xmath21 as the same as @xmath22 .",
    "likewise , when forming multiple compositions of state spaces , the order and the grouping of the spaces is immaterial",
    ". thus @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are to be identified as far as composition of state spaces is concerned .",
    "points in @xmath20 are denoted by pairs @xmath26 , and in @xmath27 by @xmath28-tuples @xmath29 as usual .",
    "the subsystems comprising a compound system are physically independent systems , but they are allowed to interact with each other for a period of time and thereby alter each other s state .",
    "+ the concept of scaling is crucial .",
    "it is this concept that makes our thermodynamics inappropriate for microscopic objects like atoms or cosmic objects like stars . for each state - space @xmath30 and number @xmath31 there is another state - space , denoted by @xmath32 with points denoted by .",
    "this space is called a _ scaled copy _ of @xmath17 . of",
    "course we identify @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we also require @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath32 when @xmath17 is the space of one gram of hydrogen , is simply the state - space of @xmath37 grams of hydrogen .",
    "the state @xmath38 is the state of @xmath39 grams of hydrogen with the same ` intensive ' properties as @xmath9 , e.g. , pressure , while ` extensive ' properties like energy , volume , etc . , are scaled by a factor @xmath37 ( by definition ) .",
    "for any given @xmath17 we can form cartesian product state spaces of the type @xmath40 . these will be called _ multiple scaled copies _ of @xmath17 .",
    "the notation @xmath32 should be regarded as merely a mnemonic at this point , but later on , with the embedding of @xmath17 into @xmath19 , it will literally be @xmath41 in the usual sense .",
    "*   _ adiabatic accessibility _ : now we come to the ordering .",
    "we say @xmath5 ( with @xmath9 and @xmath10 _ possibly in state - spaces _ ) if @xmath10 is _ adiabatically accessible _ from @xmath9 according to the definition below .",
    "different state spaces can occur , e.g. , if there is mixing or a chemical reaction between two states of a compound system to produce a state in a third system .",
    "what does this mean ?",
    "mathematically , we are just given a list of pairs @xmath42 .",
    "there is nothing more to be said , except that later on we will assume that this list has certain properties that will lead to interesting theorems about this list , and will lead , in turn , to the existence of an _ entropy function _ , @xmath0 characterizing the list .    the physical interpretation is quite another matter . in text books a process taking @xmath9 to @xmath10",
    "is usually called adiabatic if it takes place in ` thermal isolation ' , which in turn means that ` no heat is exchanged with the surroundings ' .",
    "such concepts ( heat , thermal etc . ) appear insufficiently precise to us and we prefer the following version , which is in the spirit of planck s formulation of the second law @xcite and avoids those concepts .",
    "our definition of adiabatic accessibility might at first sight appear to be less restrictive than the usual one , but as discussed in @xcite , pp .",
    "29 and 54 , in the end anything that we call an adiabatic process ( meaning that @xmath10 is adiabatically accessible from @xmath9 ) can also be accomplished in ` thermal isolation ' as the concept is usually understood .",
    "our definition has the great virtue ( as discovered by planck ) that it avoids having to distinguish between work and heat  or even having to define the concept of heat .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the theorems do not require agreement with our physical definition of adiabatic accessibility ; other definitions are conceivably possible .",
    "we emphasize also that we do not care about the temporal development involved in the state change ; we only care about the net result for the system and the rest of the universe .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a state @xmath10 is adiabatically accessible from a state @xmath9 , in symbols @xmath5 , if it is possible to change the state from @xmath9 to @xmath10 by means of an interaction with some device consisting of some auxiliary system and a weight , in such a way that the auxiliary system returns to its initial state at the end of the process whereas the weight may have risen or fallen .",

    "note that an adiabatic process , physically , does not have to be gentle , or ` static ' or anything of the kind .",
    "it can be arbitrarily violent and destructive , so long as the system is brought back to equilibrium !",
    "the ` device ' need not be a well - defined mechanical contraption .",
    "it can be another thermodynamic system , and even a gorilla jumping up and down on the system , or a combination of these  as long as the device returns to its initial state .",
    "the device can have intelligence , e.g. , it can contain a clever scientist whose strategy depends on the progress of the experiment . only the initial state @xmath9 and the final state @xmath10 matter .",
    "an example might be useful here .",
    "take a pound of hydrogen in a container with a piston .",
    "the states are describable by two numbers , energy and volume , the latter being determined by the position of the piston . starting from some state , @xmath9 , we can take our hand off the piston and let the volume increase explosively to a larger one .",
    "after things have calmed down , call the new equilibrium state @xmath10 . then @xmath5 .",
    "question : is @xmath6 true ?",
    "answer : no . to get from @xmath10 to @xmath9 adiabatically",
    "we would have to use some machinery and a weight , with the machinery returning to its initial state , and there is no way this can be done . using a weight we can , indeed ,",
    "recompress the gas to its original volume , but we will find that the energy is then larger than its original value .",
    "let us write @xmath43 in this case we say that we can go from @xmath9 to @xmath10 by an _",
    "irreversible adiabatic process_. if @xmath44 and @xmath6 we say that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are _ adiabatically equivalent _ and write @xmath45    equivalence classes under @xmath46 are called",
    "_ adiabats_.    * _ comparability _ : given two states @xmath9 and @xmath10 in two ( same or different ) state - spaces , we say that they are comparable if @xmath5 or @xmath6 ( or both ) .",
    "this turns out to be a crucial notion .",
    "two states are not always comparable ; a necessary condition is that they have the same material composition in terms of the chemical elements .",
    "example : since water is @xmath47 and the atomic weights of hydrogen and oxygen are 1 and 16 respectively , the states in the compound system of 2 gram of hydrogen and 16 grams of oxygen are comparable with states in a system consisting of 18 grams of water ( but not with 11 grams of water or 18 grams of oxygen ) .    actually , the classification of states into various state - spaces is done mainly for conceptual convenience .",
    "the second law deals only with states , and the only thing we really have to know about any two of them is whether or not they are comparable . given the relation @xmath8 for all possible states of all possible systems , we can ask whether this relation can be encoded in an entropy function according to the following :    entropy principle there is a real - valued function on all states of all systems ( including compound systems ) , called * entropy * and denoted by @xmath0 such that    1 .",
    "monotonicity : when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are comparable states then @xmath48 2 .   additivity and extensivity : if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are states of some @xmath49possibly different@xmath50 systems and if @xmath26 denotes the corresponding state in the compound system , then the entropy is additive for these states , i.e. , @xmath51 @xmath0 is also extensive , i.e. , for or each @xmath31 and each state @xmath9 and its scaled copy @xmath52 , ( defined in 2 . above ) @xmath53    a formulation logically equivalent to a ) , not using the word ` comparable ' , is the following pair of statements : @xmath54 the last line is especially noteworthy .",
    "it says that entropy must increase in an irreversible adiabatic process .",
    "the additivity of entropy in compound systems is often just taken for granted , but it is one of the startling conclusions of thermodynamics .",
    "first of all , the content of additivity , ( 2 ) , is considerably more far reaching than one might think from the simplicity of the notation . consider four states @xmath55 and suppose that @xmath5 and @xmath56 .",
    "one of our axioms , a3 , will be that then @xmath57 , and ( 2 ) contains nothing new or exciting . on the other hand , the compound system can well have an adiabatic process in which @xmath58 but @xmath59 . in this case , ( 2 ) conveys much information . indeed , by monotonicity , there will be many cases of this kind because the inequality @xmath60 certainly does not imply that @xmath61 . the fact that the inequality @xmath62 tells us _ exactly _ which adiabatic processes are allowed in the compound system ( among comparable states ) , independent of any detailed knowledge of the manner in which the two systems interact , is astonishing and is at the _ heart of thermodynamics .",
    "_ the second reason that ( 2 ) is startling is this : from ( 1 ) alone , restricted to one system , the function @xmath0 can be replaced by @xmath63 and still do its job , i.e. , satisfy ( 1 ) .",
    "however , ( 2 ) says that it is possible to calibrate the entropies of all systems ( i.e. , simultaneously adjust all the undetermined multiplicative constants ) so that the entropy @xmath64 for a compound @xmath20 is @xmath65 , even though systems 1 and 2 are totally unrelated !",
    "we are now ready to ask some basic questions :    1 .",
    "which properties of the relation @xmath8 ensure existence and ( essential ) uniqueness of @xmath0 ?",
    "2 .   can these properties be derived from simple physical premises ?",
    "which convexity and smoothness properties of @xmath0 follow from the premises ? 4",
    ".   can temperature ( and hence an ordering of states by ",
    "hotness  and  coldness ) be defined from @xmath0 and what are its properties ?",
    "the answer to question q1 can be given in the form of six axioms that are reasonable , simple , ` obvious ' and unexceptionable .",
    "an additional , crucial assumption is also needed , but we call it a ` hypothesis ' instead of an axiom because we show later how it can be derived from some other axioms , thereby answering question q2",

    "the energy coordinate is the way in which thermodynamics makes contact with mechanics , where the concept of energy arises and is precisely defined .",
    "the fact that the amount of energy in a state is independent of the manner in which the state was arrived at is , in reality , the first law of thermodynamics . a typical ( and",

    "our goal is to show , with the addition of a few more axioms , that ch holds for simple systems and their scaled products . in the process",

    "state spaces were fairly abstract things ; there was no topology .",
    "calculus , for example , played no role  contrary to the usual presentation of classical thermodynamics . for simple systems we are talking about points in @xmath190 and we can thus talk about ` open sets ' , ` convexity ' , etc .",

    "an energy coordinate has to disappear , and thermal contact does this for us .",
    "this is formalized in the following two axioms .    1 .",
    "* thermal join . * for any two simple systems with state - spaces @xmath307 and @xmath308 , there is another _ simple _ system , called the _ thermal join _ of @xmath307 and @xmath308 , with state - space @xmath309 if @xmath310 , and @xmath311 we define @xmath312 it is assumed that the formation of a thermal join is an adiabatic operation for the compound system , i.e. , @xmath313 2 .",

    "a12 is the stability statement , for it says that joining is reversible , i.e. , once the equilibrium has been established , one can cut the copper thread and retrieve the two systems back again , but with a special partition of the energies .",
    "this reversibility allows us to think of the thermal join , which is a simple system in its own right , as a special subset of the product system , @xmath20 , which we call the _ thermal diagonal_.    axioms a11 and a12 , together with the general axioms a4 , a5 , a7 and our assumption that a compound state @xmath26 is identical to @xmath320 , imply that the relation @xmath321 is refelxive and symmetric :    lemma 2    1 .",

    "likewise , it is not necessary to identify @xmath343 with @xmath344 formally by an axiom , because we do not need it .",
    "it is possible , using the present axioms , to prove @xmath345 , but we do not do so since we do not need this either .",

    "the other is that there might be a true gap , i.e. , @xmath768 might hold for some state spaces , even if both sides are finite .    in nature only states containing the same amount of the chemical elements",

    "hence @xmath769 for many pairs of state spaces , in particular , for those that contain different amounts of some chemical element .",
    "the constants @xmath680 are , therefore , never unique : for each equivalence class of state spaces ( with respect to the relation of connectedness ) one can define a constant that is arbitrary except for the proviso that the constants should be additive and extensive under composition and scaling of systems .",
    "in our world there are 92 chemical elements ( or , strictly speaking , a somewhat larger number , @xmath28 , since one should count different isotopes as different elements ) , and this leaves us with at least 92 free constants that specify the entropy of one gram of each of the chemical elements in some specific state .",
    "the other possible source of non - uniqueness , a nontrivial gap for systems with the same composition in terms of the chemical elements is , as far as we know , not realized in nature , although it is a logical possibility .",
    "the true situation seems rather to be the following : every state space @xmath17 is connected to a distinguished state space @xmath770 where the @xmath771 are the state spaces of one mole of each of the chemical elements , and the numbers @xmath772 specify the amount of each chemical element in @xmath17 .",

    "this procedure need not invoke any semipermeable membranes .",

    "it is also clear that in this case @xmath680 is unique up to the choice of arbitrary constants for the fixed systems @xmath733 .",

    "1.as we have stressed , the purpose of the entropy function is to quantify the list of equilibrium states that can evolve from other equilibrium states",

    "indeed , the early thermodynamicists understood the meaning of entropy as defined for equilibrium states .",
    "of course , in the real world , one is often close to equilibrium without actually being there , and it makes sense to talk about entropy as a function of time , and even space , for situations close to equilibrium .",
    "we do a similar thing with respect to temperature , which has the same problem that temperature is only strictly defined for a homogeneous system in equilibrium . at some point the thought arose ( and we confess our ignorance about how it arose and by whom ) that it ought to be possible to define an entropy function rigorously for manifestly _",
    "non-_equilibrium states in such a way that the numerical value of this function will increase with time as a system goes from one equilibrium state to another .",

    "this , however , is not the whole story , as boltzmann himself knew ; for one thing , @xmath782 in equilibrium ( except for ideal gases ) , and , for another , no one has so far proved the increase without making severe assumptions , and then only for a short time interval ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . ) even today , there is no universal agreement about what , precisely , one should try to prove ( as an example of the ongoing discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear if entropy can be consistently extended to non - equilibrium situations in the desired way . after a century and a half of thought , including the rise of the science of statistical mechanics as a paradigm ( which was not available to the early thermodynamicists and , therefore , outside their thoughts ) , we are far from success .",
    "it has to be added , however , that a great deal of progress in understanding the problem has been made recently ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if such a concept can be formulated precisely , will it have to involve the notion of atoms and statistical mechanical concepts , or can it be defined irrespective of models , as we have done for the entropy of equilibrium states ?",
    "this is the question we pose .",
    "there are several major problems to be overcome , and we list two of them .    1 .   the problem of time reversibility : if the concept is going to depend upon mechanical models , we have to account for the fact that both classical and quantum mechanics are time reversible .",
    "this makes it difficult to construct a mechanical quantity that can only increase under classical or quantum mechanical time evolution .",
    "indeed , this problem usually occupies center stage in most discussions of the subject , but it might , ultimately , not be the most difficult problem after all",
    ". 2 .   in our view of the subject ,",
    "a key role is played by the idea of a more or less arbitrary ( peaceful or violent ) interaction of the system under discussion with the rest of the universe whose final result is a change of the system , the change in height of a weight , and nothing more .",
    "how can one model such an arbitrary interaction in a mechanical way ? by means of an additional term in the hamiltonian ? that hardly seems like a reasonable way to model a sledgehammer that happens to fall on the system or a gorilla jumping up and down .",
    "most discussions of entropy increase refer to the evolution of systems subject to a dynamical evolution that is usually hamiltonian ( possibly time dependent ) or a mixture of hamiltonian and stochastic evolution .",

    ", most people would recognize a ) as the important problem , now and in the past . in b ) we interject a new note , which , to us , is possibly more difficult .",
    "there are several proposals for a resolution of the irreversibility problem , such as the large number ( @xmath783 ) of atoms involved , or the ` sensitive dependence on initial conditions ' ( one can shoot a ball out of a cannon , but it is very difficult to shoot it back into the cannon s mouth ) .",
    "problem b ) , in contrast , has not received nearly as much attention .    2.an essential role in our story was played by axioms a4 and a5 , which require the possiblity of having arbitrarily small samples of a given material and that these small samples behave in exactly the same way as a 1 kilogram sample .",
    "while this assumption is made in everyone s formulation of the second law , we have to recognize that absurdities will arise if we push the concept to its extreme .",
    "eventually the atomic nature of matter will reveal itself and entropy will cease to have a clear meaning .",
    "what protects us is the huge power of ten ( e.g. , @xmath784 ) that separates macroscopic physics and the realm of atoms .",
    "likewise , a huge power of ten separates time scales that make physical sense in the ordinary macroscopic world and time scales ( such as @xmath785 seconds @xmath786 times the age of the universe ) which are needed for atomic fluctuations to upset the time evolution one would obtain from macroscopic dynamics .",
    "one might say that one of the hidden assumptions in our ( and everyone else s ) analysis is that _",
    "@xmath8 is reproducible _ , i.e. , @xmath5 either holds or it does not , and there are no hidden stochastic or probabilistic mechanisms that would make the list of pairs @xmath5 ` fuzzy ' .",
    "one of the burgeoning area of physics research is mesoscopics , which deals with the interesting properties of tiny pieces of matter that might contain only a million atoms (= a cube of 100 atoms on a side ) or less .",
    "at some point the second law has to get fuzzy and a significant open problem is to formulate a fuzzy version of what we have done in @xcite .",
    "of course , no amount of ingenuity with mesoscopic systems is allowed to violate the second law on the macroscopic level , and this will have to be taken into account .",
    "one possibility could be that an entropy function can still be defined for mesoscopic systems but that @xmath8 is fuzzy , with the consequence that entropy increases only on ` the average ' , but in a totally unpredictable way  so that the occasional decrease of entropy can not be utilized to violate the second law on the macroscopic level .",
    "there are other problems as well .",
    "a simple system , such as a container of hydrogen gas , has states described by energy and volume .",

    "another problem is the meaning of equilibrium and the implicit assumption we made that after the ( violent ) adiabatic process is over the system will eventually come to some equilibrium state in a time scale that is short compared to the age of the universe . on the mesoscopic level",
    ", the achievement of equilibrium may be more delicate because a mesoscopic system might never settle down to a state with insignificant fluctuations that one would be pleased to call an equilibrium state .    to summarize ,",
    "we have listed two ( and there are surely more ) areas in which more thought , both mathematical and physical , is needed : the extension of the second law and the entropy concept to 1 ) non - equilibrium situations and 2 ) mesoscopic and even atomic situations .",
    "one might object that the problems can not be solved until the ` rules of the game ' are made clear , but discovering the rules is part of the problem .",
    "that is sometimes inherent in mathematical physics , and that is one of the intellectual challenges of the field .",
    "we are frequently asked about the connection between our approach to the second law of thermodynamics and the statistical mechanical boltzmann - gibbs - maxwell approach .",
    "let us make it clear that we value statistical mechanics as much as any physicist .",
    "it is a powerful tool for understanding physical phenomena and for calculating many quantities , especially in systems at or near equilibrium .",
    "it is used to calculate entropy , specific and latent heats , phase transition properties , transport coefficients and so on , often with good accuracy .",
    "important examples abound , such as max planck s 1901 realization @xcite that by staring into a furnace he could find avogadro s number , or linus pauling s highly accurate back - of - the - envelope calculation of the residual entropy of ice @xcite in 1935 . but is statistical mechanics essential for the second law ?    in any event , it is still beyond anyone s computational ability ( except in idealized situations ) to account for this very precise , essentially infinitely accurate law of physics from statistical mechanical principles .",
    "no exception has ever been found to the second law of thermodynamics  not even a tiny one . like conservation of energy ( the `` first '' law )",
    "the existence of a law so precise and so independent of details of models must have a logical foundation that is independent of the fact that matter is composed of interacting particles .",
    "our aim in @xcite was to explore that foundation .",
    "it was also our aim to try to formulate clear statements on the macroscopic level so that statistical mechanics can try to explain them in microscopic terms .",
    "as albert einstein put it @xcite , `` a theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises is , the more different kinds of things it relates , and the more extended is its area of applicability .",
    "therefore the deep impression which classical thermodynamics made upon me .",
    "it is the only physical theory of universal content concerning which i am convinced that , within the framework of the applicability of its basic concepts , it will never be overthrown '' .",
    "we maintain , that the second law , as understood for equilibrium states of macroscopic systems , does not require statistical mechanics , or any other particular mechanics , for its existence .",
    "it does require certain properties of macroscopic systems , and statistical mechanics is one model that , hopefully , can give those properties , such as irreversibility .",
    "one should not confuse the existence , importance , and usefulness of the boltzmann - gibbs - maxwell theory with its necessity on the macroscopic level as far as the second law is concerned .",
    "another way to make the point is this : if the statistical mechanics of atoms is essential for the second law , then that law must imply something about atoms and their dynamics .",
    "does the second law prove the existence of atoms in the way that light scattering , for example , tells us what avogadro s number has to be ? does the law distinguish between classical and quantum mechanics ?",
    "the answer to these and similar questions is no  and , if there were a direct connection , the late 19th - century wars about the existence of atoms would have been won much sooner .",
    "alas , there is no such direct connection that we are aware of , despite the many examples in which atomic constants make an appearance at the macroscopic level such as planck s radiation formula mentioned above , the sackur - tetrode equation , stability of matter with coulomb forces , and so on .",

    "<S> it is one of the few really fundamental physical laws ( in the sense that no deviation , however tiny , is permitted ) and its consequences are far reaching . this principle is independent of models , statistical mechanical or otherwise , and can be understood without recourse to carnot cycles , ideal gases and other assumptions about such things as ` heat ' , ` temperature ' , ` reversible processes ' , etc . </S>",
