    "however , as we are only interested in the fluctuations , we only need to consider the integration variables on this scale .",
    "thus , we may neglect them for the determination of the saddlepoints . after assembling things properly ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath134 as we are only interested in the imaginary part , we may again ignore the efetov  wegner or rothstein term . the imaginary part can be obtained from the difference of a retarded and an advanced green function .",
    "the two green functions yield the same kernels , apart from a sign change in the argument of the exponential function in the numerator , @xmath135 .",
    "hence , only the difference of these two exponential functions , the sine function , enters . this is equivalent to taking the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.67 ] ) while formally ignoring the imaginary unit coming with the variable @xmath133 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath136 where the integrals over @xmath132 and @xmath133 were done as in ref .",
    "hence , the correlations are , once more , of the standard gue type .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "first , it should be clear that the mean level spacing @xmath114 in the calculation above was formally the one of the strong coupling limit and has thus to be smoothly adjusted when going into another regime .",
    "therefore , our line of arguing is correct only if we are always in the bulk of the spectrum , i.e.  far away from any possible edges or gaps .",
    "second , the discussion beyond the strong coupling limit could also be done in a saddlepoint approximation of the full expression  ( [ eq2.61 ] ) .",
    "this , however , leads to a most inconvenient third order saddlepoint equation . in the approach chosen here",
    "we avoid this an also gain the insight that the strong coupling limit and the general case are related via a convolution .",
    "third , we emphasize that the connection  ( [ eq2.61 ] ) between the kernel and the generating function for @xmath83 simplifies the calculations enormously : the saddlepoints are isolated , no goldstone modes occur .",
    "furthermore , all correlations are treated at once .",
    "from the pioneering work of mott and anderson it is known that in disordered systems there are no sharp band edges for the density of states .",
    "there is a mobility edge instead separating the delocalized states in the band from the localized ones in the tails .",
    "the mathematical origin of the band edges is due to the fact that in dependence of some parameter the two solutions of the saddle point equation ( [ eq2.52 ] ) change from complex conjugate to real .",
    "this behaviour is generic , though the present model the band edges are only an artifact of the finite rank of the matrices .",
    "it therefore is worthwhile to study the regime of the band edges somewhat more in detail .    after obtaining a wkb approximation for the kernel in section  [ sec4.1 ]",
    ", we work out density of states and correlations in section  [ sec4.1 ] .      to keep the discussion simple ,",
    "we again concentrate on the strong coupling limit .",
    "starting point is the christoffel ",
    "darboux relation ( [ eq2a.05 ] ) for @xmath71 holding in this limit . using standard relations for the generalized laguerre polynomials",
    ", it can be written in the alternative form @xmath137 \\ , , \\label{eq4.01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 , which is somewhat more suitable for the present purpose .",
    "following ref .",
    "i , we write @xmath139 as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a solution of @xmath142 @xmath143 may be written as @xmath144 where @xmath145 we note that this is the same expression , which was obtained above from the saddlepoint approximation for the band edges in the strong coupling limit ( see section [ sec3.1 ] ) .",

    "inserting this into equation ( [ eq4.01 ] ) , we recover the result for @xmath149 obtained in section [ sec3.2 ] by means of the saddlepoint technique .",
    "for @xmath150 the corresponding expression reads @xmath151\\,.\\ ] ] inserting expression ( [ eq4.07 ] ) into ( [ eq4.01 ] ) one notices that @xmath152 vanishes within the limits of the wkb approximation applied . to describe this regime appropriately",
    ", one would have to go to the next wkb order .",
    "we do not proceed further in this direction , but concentrate on the immediate neighbourhood of the lower edge which is not covered by equations ( [ eq4.06 ] ) and ( [ eq4.07 ] ) .",
    "linearizing @xmath153 close to @xmath154 , @xmath155 equation ( [ eq4.03 ] ) can be solved with the result @xmath156\\ , \\nonumber\\\\    \\lambda=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{z_+-z_-}}{2z_-}\\right)^\\frac{2}{3 }    = \\left(\\frac{(nl)^{1/4}}{n+l-2\\sqrt{nl}}\\right)^\\frac{2}{3}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is the airy function . with the factor",
    "@xmath158 the asymptotic behaviour of the laguerre polynomials is reproduced correctly by equation ( [ eq4.02 ] ) .",

    ") just as in section [ sec3.2 ] , we now introduce rescaled variables @xmath168 and a rescaled correlation function @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the local density of states as given by equation ( [ eq4.11 ] ) . note that in contrast to section [ sec3.2 ] we do _ not _ perform the limit @xmath171 , since we are interested in particular in the behaviour close to the band edges .",
    "we then have @xmath172_{p , q=1,\\dots , k}\\ ] ] with @xmath173 inserting for @xmath141 the expression ( [ eq4.09 ] ) , we obtain for the regime close to the lower edge @xmath174 where @xmath175 . in the limit @xmath176",
    "we obtain @xmath177 as it should be .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the differential equation @xmath178 of the airy function , and equation ( [ eq4.14 ] ) . for @xmath179 @xmath180",
    "decays according to    @xmath181\\,,\\ ] ]    which follows from the asymptotic behaviour of the airy function ( see also equation ( [ eq4.07 ] ) ) .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is observed at @xmath182 .",
    "with decreasing density of states @xmath183 the transition point is thus approaching @xmath184 , i.e. the eigenvalues become more and more uncorrelated .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] where the two  point correlation function @xmath185 ^ 2 $ ] is shown for different values of @xmath186 in the neighbourhood of the lower band edge .",
    "in addition the gue result is shown for comparison .",
    "we observe with decreasing @xmath38 a gradual transition from a gue behaviour to that expected for completely uncorrelated eigenvalues .     for different values of @xmath186 . for comparison",

    "i the density of states for the billiard with randomly distributed scatterers was calculated , doubly averaged over disorder and shape of the billiard .",
    "we mention in passing that the resulting model shows some formal similarities to chiral random matrix models  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the way how the average over the disorder is done . in the present work , the results of ref .",

    "@xcite , the correlation functions are expressed in terms of a determinant .",
    "this determinant structure of the correlation functions is immediatly obvious in the supersymmetric formulation of the model due to the form of the berezinian in eigenvalue angle coordinates .",
    "moreover , an explicit christoffel  darboux formula is given for the kernel entering the determinant .    by means of a saddlepoint appproximation",
    ", we rederive the density of states in the strong coupling limit and also find the real part of the one  point function .",
    "we show that the correlation functions in the bulk of the spectrum on the scale of the local mean level spacing are , for all couplings , of gue type .    applying a wkb approximation to the kernel",
    ", the correlation functions are studied close to the band edges in the strong coupling limit , where the number of scatterers is large and the scattering potential is strong .",
    "the above mentioned saddlepoint approximation is not valid in this regime . within the band",
    "the two  point correlation function shows a gue behaviour , but approaching the band edges and proceeding towards the band tails the eigenvalues become more and more uncorrelated .",
    "this is exactly the fingerprint expected for a mobility edge and a localization  delocalization transition .",
    "we notice that a drastic depletion of the density of states this accompanies this transition . thus , the localization  delocalization transition found in the non  linear @xmath1model  @xcite is of a different nature . in the latter ,",
    "the average is over an ensemble of white  noise correlated impurities , while two averages are performed in the present model , one over the wavefunctions at the positions of the scatterers and another one over the billiard spectrum .",
    "the resulting models are therefore different .",
    "there is a kinetic term in the non ",
