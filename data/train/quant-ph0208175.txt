    "this idea , in a different context in which the trap is coupled to a boson reservoir to account for the detected decoherence , has already been paid attention @xcite .",

    "the stochastic promotion is performed by substituting @xmath152 in and calculating @xmath153 $ ] . here",
    "note that the different energy levels are perturbed in a distinct fashion determined both by the deterministic functions @xmath154 and the standard real brownian motions @xmath155 .",
    "the latter show correlation properties expressed by the functions @xmath156 :    @xmath157    the density operator in interaction picture will then be given by    @xmath158p_{n}^{m_{z}}\\rho(0)p_{m}^{m_{z}^{'}}\\ ] ]    the expectation value in can be calculated with the same techniques as before ( cf . also appendix [ appendix ] ) and drives us to :    @xmath159    where @xmath160 with @xmath161 .",
    "the expression already contains the necessary ingredients to arrive at the detected behaviour , since if the ion trap is initially set in a fock state for the com mode and the ground state for the internal levels , i.e. @xmath162 , then the probability @xmath163 in this scheme is    @xmath164\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    before making physical assumptions let us notice that since the brownian motions are standard , @xmath165 for all @xmath20 ( the brackets mean that both superscripts must be equal ) and thus @xmath166 for all @xmath20 .",
    "now we pose the most important physical hypothesis , namely the stochastic perturbation depends exclusively upon the energy level of the com mode ( at least up to the order of detection we are nowadays capable ) . as a first consequence",
    "we then can claim that @xmath167 for all @xmath20 , and then @xmath168 and @xmath166 and also @xmath169 , hence reduces to    @xmath170=\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[1+e^{-\\frac{\\lambda_{n+1,n+1}^{+,-}(t)}{2}}\\cos(2\\eta\\omega t\\sqrt{n+1})\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    second since for fixed @xmath20 the internal levels are equally affected , we can also write @xmath171 for each @xmath20 . finally instead of discussing upon absolute energy values , it is physically more reasonable to talk about energy differences and we propose that the stochastic perturbations be introduced in such a way as to have    @xmath172    where @xmath173 is an arbitrary exponent , @xmath174 a constant and where we have assumed for simplicity that the random perturbation is a white noise .",
    "note however that it is possible to use more general expressions .",
    "notice the different behaviour of the added term for each distinct subspace of constant com energy in agreement with the physical hypothesis assumed above",
    ". under these hypotheses @xmath175 and after elementary calculations finally reduces to    @xmath176    this expression shows a clear resemblance to @xmath177 written above .",
    "we believe that both @xmath174 and @xmath173 depends sensitively upon the particular physical system under study . + for completeness we also include the expression for @xmath163 when the com mode has an initial state with diagonal density - matrix elements @xmath113 :    @xmath178    this expression has the same structure as the experimental ones shown in @xcite . the whole scheme can obviously be applied to the carrier , first red sideband and successive excitation too .",
    "we include in figs .",
    "[ fockgraph ] , [ thermalgraph ] and [ cohergraph ] the predictions in the orthodox and the above formalism in the cases when the com mode is in a fock state , thermal state and coherent state and the internal state is the ground state .",
    "the use of stochastic methods in hilbert space is of course not new ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of representing open quantum systems by means of stochastic processes already appeared in the literature some years ago @xcite and it has been widely used in quantum optics @xcite and in the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite . here",
    "we pursue the line initiated in @xcite stepping forward by randomizing not just the ( thus stochastic ) state vector of the open quantum system , but its evolution operator .",
    "we find at least three reasons to do that .",
    "firstly when one write a random evolution equation for the state vector ( thus an ito stochastic differential equation ) an extra term must be included , namely the ito correction .",
    "consider for example the following evolution    @xmath179    where the operator @xmath180 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath1 ( just for simplicity ) .",
    "from a physical point of view we find little intuitive the origin of the ito correction term , which however appears in a natural way by applying ito s formula to the evolution operator with the stochastic modification @xmath181 .",
    "secondly the use of random evolution operators emphasizes the idea that it is the evolution which is random and there is nothing random about the hamiltonian ( and thus the energy levels of the system ) , something which may misleadingly be understood from equation .",
    "finally the use of operators rather than just state vectors opens the possibility of trying to employ group - representation techniques @xcite and thus of rooting the random nature of the evolution upon possible stochastic symmetries . + this proposal is not intended to solve the so - called _ macroobjectification _ problem ( better known as the measurement problem ) by means of a random dynamical reduction process .",
    "indeed it can be readily shown that the state driven by a random evolution operator @xmath182 is never reduced in clear contrast to these models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for the case of the previous random evolution operator this can be readily proven .",
    "let @xmath181 be the random evolution operator of a quantum system ( @xmath183=0 $ ] for simplicity ) .",
    "then the ito differential equation for the state vector is . now to check whether this evolution produces dynamical state - reduction or not it is sufficient to study the stochastic process ( cf .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath184    where @xmath185 .",
    "since @xmath186 and @xmath187 , the random evolution is unitary almost surely and then    @xmath188    thus there is no actual state - vector reduction process around the eigenvectors of @xmath180 .",
    "this of course differs radically for the behaviour of @xmath189 in stochastic state vector reduction models , where the evolution equation is typically written as @xcite    @xmath190    the nonlinear terms appear as a consequence of normalization conditions @xcite and play no significant role in the reduction process .",
    "note the singular difference between eqs . and",
    ": despite the fact that both of them produce the same master equation ( already noted in @xcite ) , only the second one ensures a reduction process taking place and this is because of the @xmath191 factor appearing with the wiener differential @xmath192 .",
    "it is an open question whether there exists a physical process or not introducing this phase factor in the evolution equation for @xmath189 .",
    "+ the great utility of stochastic processes to account for the decoherence suffered by a quantum system is its versatility to also account for possible intrinsic decohering effects . by this",
    "we mean not a fundamental modification of quantum principles , as e.g. in @xcite but just the idea that when a quantum system is described ( e.g. an atom interacting with the electromagnetic field ) some approximations must necessarily be made to be able to analytically handle with it and we claim that some of these approximations may hidingly induce decohering effects upon the approximated model . in this sense",
    "this decoherence can be called _ intrinsic _ since no environmental effect is taken into account . undoubtedly this does not deny in any way the possibility of having a system decohered by its environment .",
    "notice the special relevance of such a hypothetical effect in quantum systems designed to implement quantum - computational and quantum - information - processing tasks , since they usually possess certain degree of complexity which forces us to seek for adequate approximations to describe them .",
    "a possible relationship of this intrinsic decoherence with scalability of quantum - informational and quantum computational systems would also have important consequences to find robust mechanisms to process information in a quantum way .",
    "+ besides possible new physical interpretations supporting the use of stochastic processes in quantum mechanics , its utility to solve certain me as shown above justifies the search to extend the main result reported here . currently the way to drop",
    "the condition of selfadjointness of lindblad operators is under study .",
    "+ finally a mathematical remark should be made regarding the proof of the previous result .",
    "one may wonder why the same procedure as in the commuting case , i.e. adding a stochastic term @xmath193 , is not used in the noncommuting case .",
    "the reason jointly rests upon the ito s formula and the lack of some derivatives in the case of noncommuting operators .",
    "formula @xcite basically states that if the real stochastic process @xmath194 satisfies the ito sde @xmath195 , then the real stochastic process defined as @xmath196 satisfies the ito sde given by    @xmath197    this means that both the first and second partial derivatives of @xmath198 must exist to be able to apply this formula .",
    "if the stochastic process is operator - valued as e.g. @xmath199 with @xmath29\\neq   0 $ ] , then ito s formula can not be directly applied since the partial derivates of @xmath200 can not be found .",
    "this difficulty has been circumvented by changing to the heisenberg picture before introducing the stochastic modifications .",
    "however it would be desirable to have an ito s formula for operator - valued stochastic processes valid both for commuting and noncommuting cases .",
    "we have proven how any lindblad evolution with selfadjoint lindblad operators can be understood as an averaged random evolution operator .",
    "the proof included here allows us to extend the previous result to nonmarkovian situations , though keeping the lindbladian structure of the master equations , and as a result we have provided a straightforward method to solve this kind of master equations .",
    "the conjunction of stochastic methods and the spectral representation theorem has also allowed us to generalize intrinsic decoherence models already present in the literature .",
    "the mathematical versatility of stochastic methods has also permitted us to propose a generalization to the jaynes - cummings model , and compare its predictions with experimental results in cavity qed as well as in ion traps .",
    "we have argued that the main physical advantage stems from the possibility of studying decohering effects not necessarily rooted on the environmental action upon the system .",
    "a comparison with dynamical collapse models reveals that the random unitary operators used here do not produce any kind of state vector reduction .",
    "one of us ( d.s . ) acknowledges the support of madrid education council under grant bocam 20 - 08 - 1999 .",
