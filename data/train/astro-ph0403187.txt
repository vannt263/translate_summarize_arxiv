    "for many years it has been assumed that the main pulse and interpulse of the crab pulsar ( psr  b0531 + 21 ) are perfectly lined up in phase over the full range of the electro - magnetic spectrum . even though there have been reports in the past that this alignment may not be as perfect as generally assumed , the absolute calibration of spacecraft clocks was not sufficiently accurate to allow a precise measurement of the phase difference .",
    "the most compelling result predating the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) observations was presented by @xcite , based on figaro  ii observations covering 0.15 to 4.0  mev , that were made in 1986 and 1990 . while discounting the 1986 result which has a considerable uncertainty due to potential errors in the dispersion measure , we consider the 1990 result ( the @xmath2-ray pulse leading the radio pulse by 375@xmath1148  @xmath0s ) fairly reliable , though the error is probably underestimated .",
    "the precision with which absolute time can be determined with the rxte clock allows us to time x - ray pulses with an accuracy better than 10  @xmath0s , depending on pulse shape , as shown by @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the crab pulsar monitoring program at jodrell bank provides timing ephemeris data , reduced to infinite frequency .",
    "these ( monthly ) timing ephemerides represent fits to the daily time - of - arrival measurements with rms residuals of order 20 - 50  @xmath0s .",
    "this allows us to measure and monitor the radio to x - ray phase difference of the pulses with an error of about one milli - period .",
    "we have reported on these results in the past ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    at optical wavelengths ,",
    "@xcite has reported a time delay of 140  @xmath0s ( optical leading the radio ) , but the details are not easily accessible .",
    "@xcite report that , in the case of giant radio pulses , the optical pulse in the wavelength range 600 - 750  nm is leading the radio pulse by 100@xmath120  @xmath0s .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , claim that the optical ( 355 - 825  nm ) and radio peaks are coincident within 30  @xmath0s , based on test observations with a prototype transition - edge sensor detector . however , it is not clear whether the timing calibration of the instrument was complete at the time .",
    "@xcite presented results from osse observations ( 50 - 100  kev ) , indicating that the hard x - ray to radio lag was @xmath330@xmath130  @xmath0s .",
    "it would appear that the estimate of their errors was too optimistic .",
    "@xcite present pulse profiles but no absolute phases .",
    "@xcite report on integral data , covering 6 - 50  kev , and deriving a time delay ( the radio trailing ) of 280@xmath140  @xmath0s for a single epoch .",
    "the precise timing of the pulses in the different wavelength regimes has important repercussions for the understanding of the nature and spatial origin of the emission processes that give rise to the pulses in different parts of the spectrum . @xcite",
    "have suggested that , while the radio precursor comes from the polar cap , the pulse and interpulse originate in the outer gap in the magnetosphere , with the higher energy pulses being generated at significantly greater height .",
    "thus , measuring the pulse shapes and the absolute timing throughout the electromagnetic spectrum places important constraints on the shape of the the outer gap and on the height in the magnetosphere at which the radiation is generated .    in this paper",
    "we will present the results of the rxte monitoring campaign of the crab pulsar from the start of that mission .",
    "we have adopted the radio nomenclature for the features in the pulse profile ( main pulse , bridge , and interpulse ) .",
    "the observations presented here were made as part of an on - going monitoring campaign of the rossi x - ray timing explorer s ( rxte ) .",
    "observations of about 1000  s in duration were initially made at weekly , later bi - weekly , intervals , with the exception of a period from mid - may until mid - july when the crab pulsar is too close to the sun .    in this paper",
    "we shall use the events in the 2 - 16 kev range , collected with the rxte s proportional counter array ( pca ) in 177 observations between mjd 50129 and 52941 .",
    "for the first four and a half years the observations were made in pulsar fold mode , with approximately 80 bins per period .",
    "halfway through the fifth year this was changed to an event mode with 250  @xmath0s time resolution .",
    "the accuracy of the rxte clock in absolute time is about 8  @xmath0s for data taken before 29 april 1997 ( mjd 50567 ) ; see @xcite .",
    "after that date , the error decreased to 2  @xmath0s @xcite .",
    "this accuracy can be achieved by applying the fine clock corrections supplied by the rxte gof .",
    "in addition to the clock correction , there is an instrumental delay correction for the pca of 16 - 20  @xmath0s . without the fine clock correction",
    "the uncertainty in absolute time is 100  @xmath0s .",
    "the radio timing ephemeris is derived from jodrell bank observations , daily at 610  mhz and weekly at 1420  mhz .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . reduced to `` infinite frequency '' , the ephemeris provides the dispersion - corrected time of arrival of the center of the main pulse and is published on the world - wide web .",
    "the ephemeris records contain : range of validity ( mjd , utc ) ; phase - zero in mjd ( utc ; geocenter ) ; ra , dec ( j2000 , fk5 ) ; @xmath4 and its first two derivatives ; rms of the solution s fit .",
    "the timing ephemeris records , each of which covers one month , are created by the tempo package , on the basis of the jpl solar system ephemeris de200 . in the period",
    "prior to mjd 50870 the crab pulsar suffered a substantial amount of variable multipath scattering within the nebula ; see also @xcite .",
    "while the jodrell bank staff endeavored to remove the effects of this from the data , there was uncertainty in doing so , and this is reflected in the quoted errors and in the increased scatter .",
    "apart from uncertainty in the delay due to scattering , which may change on timescales of a few months , the errors quoted in the ephemeris also contain a contribution arising from unknown systematic effects in the system , such as unmodeled delays in filterbanks and imperfect polarization calibration .",
    "this amounts to about 40  @xmath0s and should not be treated as a statistical error which reduces in a known fashion upon averaging .",
    "the observations were analyzed using the program _",
    "fasebin _ which applies the barycenter correction , ties the arrival times to the radio timing ephemeris , and bins the events in absolute phase .",
    "_ fasebin _ is the core of the _ ftool _ @xcite _ fasebin_. the unpulsed component is then subtracted and the data are integrated over the energy range 2 - 16 kev . a typical 2 - 16 kev pulse profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    at this point we needed to decide how to define the phase of the main x - ray pulse .",
    "the problem is that , while the radio pulse is very symmetric , the x - ray pulse is clearly asymmetric . in order to avoid any assumptions concerning the modeling of the pulse shape to enter into our analysis",
    ", we decided to use the peak of the pulse as representative of the x - ray phase . to this end",
    "we used three different peak finding algorithms , each designed to be free of model assumptions to the extent possible : a parabolic fit to the highest bin in the profile and its two neighbors , using 200 phase bins ; fitting a lorentzian function to the phase range 0.98 to 1.00 , using 400 phase bins ; and calculating the first moment over that part of the pulse where the bins exceed 80% of the highest bin , using 800 phase bins .",
    "this procedure allows us to determine the pulse phase in an individual observation with an accuracy of 1  milliperiod .",
    "we did investigate whether the time resolution of the observations gives rise to an additional systematic error and found this not to be the case : lorentzian fits to two back - to - back observations made in the fall of 2003 with resolutions of 250  @xmath0s and 16  @xmath0s , respectively , differed by less than 0.1 milliperiod .    the absolute phase of the peak of the x - ray main pulse ( with respect to the peak of the radio main pulse , using the lorentzian fits ) , as a function of time ( in modified julian days ) is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] ; the errors are a combination of the 1  milliperiod error mentioned above and the rms deviations in the fits of the radio timing ephemerides and typically amount to 40  @xmath0s . independently from these statistical errors there is the systematic error of up to 40  @xmath0s introduced by the radio receiver system and calibration , as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "fig .  [ fig2 ] shows the history of the main x - ray pulse phase , with the occurrences of glitches marked .",
    "glitches 7 through 12 are taken from @xcite , while the glitch numbered 8 corresponds to note 12 on the jodrell bank web page and adding one to glitch numbers 12 through 18 yields the corresponding note numbers ( 13 through 19 ) on that page .",
    "we have monitored the x - ray emission more closely following two glitches , but found no unusual behavior .",
    "the data points in this figure can be divided into four quality categories .",
    "first , the data points that are based on timing ephemerides prior to mjd 50870 obviously display larger deviations than the later ones ; we attribute this to the poorer quality of those radio ephemeris records .",
    "second , there are a number of points with high error estimates ( @xmath55  milliperiods ) , associated with glitches ; the monthly timing ephemeris records are not sufficiently fine - grained to handle glitches properly .",
    "third , there are seven outlyers ( below phase 0.9860 ) that are clearly well below the remaining data points . in all cases",
    "these represent either all observations covered by a single ephemeris record or observations at the edge of such a record ; hence , we attribute these to inaccuracies in the timing ephemerides .",
    "fourth , the remaining 111 data points form a normal distribution with the expected rms scatter of 1  milliperiod .",
    "this indicates that the data are consistent with a constant value .",
    "the data points from the first three categories are represented by open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; the high - quality data points ( category 4 ) are shown as filled circles .    in order to determine the phase of the x - ray main pulse we have excluded all data points that were deemed flawed ( i.e. , in the first three categories above ) .",
    "least - squares fits ( weighted averages ) to the results from the three different peak - finding algorithms that we used lead us to conclude that the x - ray main pulse leads the radio main pulse ( as defined by the radio timing ephemerides ) by 10.25@xmath10.15  milliperiod , or 344@xmath15  @xmath0s , with a reduced @xmath6 of 1.3 .",
    "the quoted errors represent the differences between the results from the three methods .",
    "the statistical errors in the three individual fits are smaller .",
    "in addition , of course , there is still the uncertainty of the 40  @xmath0s systematic error in the radio ephemerides .",
    "we emphasize that , although we believe these error estimates to be realistic , a different definition of the pulse phase may lead to larger discrepancies .",
    "ideally , one should analyze the data that are available in the different spectral bands with a uniform pulse definition .",
    "the result obtained by @xcite of 280@xmath140  @xmath0s for a single integral observation is probably to be considered consistent with our findings , especially since it used a timing ephemeris record at mjd 52685 that gives rise to slightly elevated phase values in our data .",
    "however , the phases that they quote for the main pulse on mjd 52683 and mjd 52697 , derived from the same rxte observations that we have used , differ from our values by + 1.7 and + 1.1 milliperiods , respectively .",
    "we believe that this difference is due to the definition of the phase that is used by these authors .",
    "@xcite define the phase of the main peak as the position of an asymmetric lorentzian fit to the phase range 0.95 to 1.05 .",
    "this definition , in our opinion , is not as free of model - dependent assumptions as our analysis methodology ; it appears that there is a systematic offset of about 40 - 50  @xmath0s .",
    "note that , since these authors used the same jodrell bank timing ephemeris records , the radio systematic error does not play a role here .",
    "as to the question whether the lag between the x - ray and radio pulses is constant in phase ( i.e. , the lag is rotational in nature ) or in time ( i.e. , the lag represents a pathlength difference ) , the data are not conclusive .",
    "the former would require the phase offset in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] to be constant with time , while the latter would require the phase to increase linearly with a slope of @xmath7 period / day .",
    "a linear fit to the good data in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] yields a slope of @xmath8 .",
    "this result is probably affected by malmquist bias and possibly other sources of systematic errors .",
    "unless our measurement accuracy can be dramatically improved , it will require at least another seven years of monitoring before we can answer this question definitively in this manner .",
    "if indeed we are dealing with a time offset , this would correspond to a pathlength difference of about 100  km .",
    "additional analysis of the rxte data reveals that the pca and hexte pulses are perfectly aligned to within 1  milliperiod ( i.e. , no phase change over the 2 to 30  kev energy range ) , while pulse phase determinations over a 12-hour crab observation show less than 1  milliperiod variation in the phase of the main pulse .",
    "this is all within the measurement errors .",
    "we have measured the phase difference between the x - ray main pulse and interpulse , a quantity that is independent of any uncertainties in the radio timing ephemeris records .",
    "the average value over the 7.6 year period is 0.4001@xmath10.0002 period .",
    "there do not appear to be any variations on time scales of the order of a year or less , but we can not entirely exclude systematic variations or systematic errors of the order of 1  milliperiod on time scales of several years .",
    "the x - ray main pulse leads its radio counterpart by about 344@xmath140  @xmath0s ( systematic error ) ; the statistical error is 5  @xmath0s .",
    "this is more than twice the time difference of 140  @xmath0s that @xcite determined for the optical b band and three times the 100  @xmath0s measured by @xcite in red light .",
    "the time or phase difference appears to have been constant over the past eight years , but the data are not accurate enough to distinguish between the two .",
    "the errors in individual measurements range up to 50  @xmath0s .",
    "we should caution the reader when making comparisons with results in other wave bands .",
    "first , various authors have used different definitions of the pulse phase . in our estimation",
    ", our own definition agrees with that used in the radio band , as does the definition of @xcite , but that is probably not true for most other reports .",
    "second , the scatter in values for individual observations is fairly large ( a milliperiod ) and may be intrinsic . greater accuracy can only be achieved with a statistically significant set of observations .",
    "as we have mentioned , there is a systematic error of up to 40  @xmath0s in the offset due to uncertainties in the interstellar scattering and the calibration of the radio equipment .",
    "this error may change on timescales of a few months , but since we do not know whether ( and if so , by how much ) the error is reduced by averaging , we quote 40  @xmath0s as the final uncertainty for the radio to x - ray timing of the pulse",
    ". however , such an error does not affect the comparison with results from other wavebands provided they are all approximately contemporaneous and use the same jodrell bank timing ephemeris records .",
    "on the other hand , it also appears that most ( if not all ) errors for the results at other wavebands quoted in the introduction are seriously underestimated by ignoring the systematic error .",
    "the phase difference between the two x - ray pulses is constant at 0.400 period , within the measurement errors .",
    "it is also equal to the phase difference between the radio main pulse and interpulse , within the measurement error .",
    "it may be of interest to note that in the x - ray pulse profile the trailing edges of the pulse as well as the interpulse are distinctly steeper than their leading edges .",
    "this does not appear to be the case for the optical interpulse .",
    "if the x - ray to radio lag were a true phase lag , attributable to the ( radial ) energy distribution across a cone , with the pulses occurring near the cone edges , one would expect the placement to be symmetrical , i.e. , one x - ray pulse to be leading , the other trailing .",
    "as it stands , both x - ray pulses are leading by the same amount .",
    "the simplest explanation for this phenomenon is that we are dealing with a time delay reflecting a pathlength difference : the radio pulses originate approximately 100  km closer to the surface of the neutron star , as already suggested by @xcite .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the efforts of edward morgan and robert shirey to keep up with constructing pulsar fold mode configurations as the pulsar slowed down .",
    "we are indebted to the rxte - gof for maintaining the rxte fine clock correction file , tdc.dat .",
    "we are grateful to robert pritchard and mark roberts for maintaining the jodrell bank crab timing ephemerides .",
