    "the president of the united states is indirectly elected by the electoral college ; the electoral college consists of 538 electors , with each state apportioned an amount equal to the amount of senators and representatives from that state serving in congress . in order to win the presidential election ,",
    "the candidate must receive at least 270 electoral votes .    with the exception of two states ( nebraska and maine which apportion their votes by congressional district ) ,",
    "each state awards the whole sum of their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state .",
    "because of the discrete nature in which votes are awarded , there are @xmath2 ways in which the election could go .    however ,",
    "using polling data and recent election history , we can determine with great certainty that many states will always go democrat or republican .",
    "thus , the outcome of the election is determined by a small number of `` swing states '' which poll nearly evenly for both parties . using recent polling data",
    ", a typical list might be : colorado ( 9 ) , florida ( 29 ) , iowa ( 6 ) , michigan ( 16 ) , nevada ( 6 ) , new hampshire ( 4 ) , north carolina ( 16 ) , ohio ( 18 ) , virginia ( 13 ) , and wisconsin ( 10 ) .",
    "( each state is listed with its electoral votes in parenthesis . ) in this instance , the democratic candidate enters the swing state contest with 221 electoral votes and the republican with 191 votes ; either candidate needs 270 votes to win the election . only counting these ten states , there are @xmath3 partitions of the electoral college .    of the 1024 possible partitions of the swing state electoral college ,",
    "741 of them achieve 49 or more electoral votes thus leading to a democratic victory , and 283 of them achieve 79 or more electoral votes leading to a republican victory",
    ". the value of a state to a candidate has not only to do with its electoral size , but its `` fit '' with other states as measured by the frequency it appears in winning partitions . to illustrate this interaction between states ,",
    "if the democrat loses ohio and florida , he can still win the election with michigan , wisconsin , virginia , new hampshire and nevada or iowa , achieving exactly the @xmath4 necessary votes .",
    "however , losing virginia makes new hampshire , nevada and iowa much less valuable .",
    "now consider the likelihood that a specific partition would occur , assuming @xmath5 are the probabilities that the democrat will win states @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the probabilities of losing state @xmath8 .",
    "the probability that the election follows a particular partition ( call it @xmath9 ) is then ,    @xmath10    thus , we have a set of probabilities , @xmath11 , corresponding to the 1024 different scenarios for the outcome of the swing states . using this ,",
    "the probability of the democrat winning , @xmath12 , is :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the electoral votes awarded to the candidate in partition @xmath9 , and @xmath15 is the number of electoral votes the candidate needs from the swing states to win . the unit step function , @xmath16 , restricts the sum to winning partitions .    given the discrete nature of the electoral college and inhomogeneous electoral vote values , we pose the following question : if @xmath17 votes for one candidate within a particular state could be added for a set `` cost''thereby increasing the probability of winning that state  in which state should that investment be made ?",
    "@xcite we define this quantity by an _ electoral susceptibility _",
    "@xmath18 which roughly measures the variation of the winning probability with the probability of winning state @xmath1 .    in an inhomogeneous electoral college , the removal of a single state @xmath19 affects the number of times state @xmath1 appears in the set of winning partitions .",
    "this is true in general for any pair of states @xmath20 and leads to unintuitive correlations between the states .",
    "associating entropy with the logarithm of the number of appearances of a state within the set of winning partitions , the entropy per state ( in effect , the chemical potential ) is not additive and the states may be said to `` interact . ''",
    "analogously to thermodynamics , the susceptibility to a change in an external parameter involves the variation of free energy with respect to the parameter . within this analogy ,",
    "the free energy can not be written as a sum of individual particle free energies because of interactions between the particles .",
    "this state of affairs is closely related to the phenomenon of entropically driven attraction in bi - disperse colloidal solutions . in solution ,",
    "the entropy of the small particles depends implicitly on the coordinates of the large particles .",
    "the entropy is then maximized by configurations where the large particles are close to one another reducing the volume they exclude .",
    "in our model let there be @xmath21 swing states having electoral vote values @xmath22 and winning probabilities for candidate @xmath23 of @xmath24 , for @xmath25 . consider a partition to be defined as a set of integers @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "the probability of a partition is @xmath28 and the probability of candidate @xmath23 winning an election that requires @xmath29 electoral votes from the swing states is then : @xmath30    let @xmath31 be the number of additional votes for @xmath23 acquired in state @xmath1 , expressed in terms of equivalent electoral votes .",
    "we are interested in computing the following quantity which we define as the electoral susceptibility ( es ) @xmath32 the first factor will turn out to measure an unormalized combinatoric increase in @xmath12 with inclusion of state @xmath1 .",
    "the second factor is dominant when the probabilities @xmath33 deviate strongly from @xmath34 and the state @xmath1 is no longer strictly a swing state . to express the susceptibility ,",
    "note that @xmath35 may always be written in terms of conditional probabilities based upon state @xmath1 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the probability of winning @xmath38 electoral votes without state @xmath1 .",
    "therefore @xmath39 it is now seen that the first factor encodes the correlations that are present for a particular @xmath29 by measuring how many additional winning partitions are available with the inclusion of state @xmath1 .",

    ". however , the residual variations in @xmath0 between states reflect interactions or _ correlations _ between two or more states appearance in the set of winning partitions [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]",
    "the susceptibility @xmath0 has been computed for a model with ten swing states ( listed in table ( [ pequalshalf_table ] ) ) and @xmath44 , corresponding to a common electoral scenario for the democratic candidate entering the swing state electoral contest . the inner chart of figure [ pequalshalf ] show the unnormalized susceptibilities @xmath45 for all of the states in the model .",
    "as expected , their shares are closely proportional to their electoral counts , @xmath46 .",
    "the normalized susceptibilities , @xmath0 , shown in the outer chart , roughly equalizes the individual state shares .    however close inspection of table [ pequalshalf_table ] shows that they are not exactly the same , the largest three being florida , nevada and iowa .",
    "these differences are a consequence of the subtle correlations between states present in the set of winning partitions .",
    "for instance , even though nevada ( 6 ) and new hampshire ( 4 ) are of similar size , nevada works cooperatively with more states and appears in more winning partitions ( those with a vote total of @xmath44 or more ) .",
    "similarly , even though ohio and florida are the largest states , ohio appears with a higher frequency in the winning partitions .",
    "the presence of a correlation between two states that effects the states susceptibility , @xmath0 , depends very much upon @xmath29 , a feature we attempt to explore analytically in section v.",
    "using aggregate polling data assembled at the fivethirtyeight blog from the beginning of october 2012 @xcite , we have computed the electoral susceptibilities @xmath47 of ten swing states .",
    "specifically , the polling percentages for candidates and their variances are used in equation ( [ normal ] ) , which determine the probability , @xmath33 , and parameter , @xmath48 , for state @xmath1 .",

    "again , the inner pie of figure ( [ obama ] ) shows the unnormalized susceptibilities which reflect the relative electoral vote contribution of state @xmath1 , @xmath46 , but not the effect of changing a fixed number of votes .",
    "table [ romney_table ] and figure ( [ romney ] ) show the same analysis for governor romney .",
    "note that the susceptibilities for obama and romney are close but not exactly identical ; this effect , mentioned in section ii , is a consequence of an even number ( 126 ) of electoral swing state votes .",

    "the probability of a candidate achieving the winning number of votes , @xmath29 , or more ( analogous to equation ( [ prob ] ) ) is : e(n_w ) = _ \\{q_k}p(\\{q_k } ) ( _ kq_k n_k - n_w )    for a model with four levels , the susceptibility of a state in level @xmath56 , @xmath50 , is shown in figure [ fig_zipf ] .",
    "small @xmath29 corresponds to a `` one - sided '' election where one candidate enters the swing state contest needing only a small number of votes to win , in this case @xmath64 , the total number of electoral votes . for @xmath65 ,",

    "this is the susceptibility normalized with respect to the susceptibility of the single highest electoral count state .",
    ", width=283 ]",
    "the electoral susceptibility @xmath0 is roughly a measure of where campaign capital to change votes should be spent to maximize the probability of winning the election .",
    "our analysis points to subtle correlations between the frequency of states appearances in the set of winning partitions of the electoral college which is not easily intuited .    from the analysis of the hierarchical zipf model ( section [ zipf ] )",
    "it is seen that in close swing state electoral contests , the largest state has the largest susceptibility , and in `` one - sided '' contests small states have the highest susceptibilities .",
    "the latter effect may be partially understood simply by looking at the dependence of the winning probability , @xmath35 , upon the average state size in electoral votes .",
    "for instance in the example given in the introduction of ten swing states , the ratio of the number of democrat winning partitions to republican winning partitions was @xmath72 .",
    "the ratio of winning electoral votes ( republican / democrat ) was @xmath73 .",
    "if the election were an `` even '' electoral contest , both ratios would be unity .",
    "the proliferation of winning to losing partitions compared with the ratio of electoral votes is a reflection of the number of relatively small states giving rise to large number of winning combinations for the candidate ( the democrat in this case ) who enters the swing state electoral contest in the lead .",
    "consider the extreme example : a candidate needing only 5 electoral votes would much prefer an electoral college having 20 states carrying 1 vote apiece than an electoral college having 5 states carrying 4 votes apiece .",
    "small states are more valuable per capita because they carry a larger per capita entropy .",
    "however the situation is more complex in the realistic , highly inhomogeneous , electoral college . even in the @xmath41",
    "equal probability case , several large and small states have comparable susceptibilities .",
    "the 49 votes needed by the democratic candidate corresponds to neither a close nor `` one - sided '' electoral contest . also , from the analysis above it is not obvious why the susceptibilities are exactly the same for the leading _ and _ trailing candidate .",
    "lastly , we mention how this calculation might be improved for a realistic campaign .",
    "it is well known that one electoral vote is equivalent to a different number of voters in different states .",
    "( for up to date demographics see reference @xcite . )",
    "this correspondence needs to be folded through our derivative leading to equation [ dpds ] .",
    "this research was supported by the department of energy de - fg02 - 08er64623hofstra university center for condensed matter , research corporation cc6535 ( gl ) , the howard hughes medical institute scholar program ( bc ) and the columbia university program on the genetics of complex disorders ( jc ) .",
    "the parameter , @xmath31 , corresponds to population equivalent to one electoral vote in state @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the demographics of the electoral college system make the population equivalent to one electoral vote different in every state .",
    "our calculation could be easily modified to include this effect .",
    "see discussions of `` return on investment '' in the fivethirtyeight blog by nate silver : fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/. as the fivethirtyeight blog algorithm is not public , we are unsure how electoral susceptibility relates to return on investment . for a perspective on how a single vote affects an election see : `` am i decisive , '' w. mebane , http://www-personal.umich.edu/  wmebane / fall99/gov317/pdecisive.pdf . wikipedia.org/wiki/file:state@xmath74population@xmath74per@xmath74electoral@xmath74vote.png"
