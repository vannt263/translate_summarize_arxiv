    "the semi - relativistic ( weakly relativistic ) effects describing by the breit hamiltonian give contribution in properties of quantum plasmas .",
    "hence one finds contributions of the quantum bohm potential , the semi - relativistic correction to the quantum bohm potential , the relativistic correction to the fermi pressure , the darwin interaction , and the semi - relativistic correction to the coulomb interaction @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however we can expect the presence of other classic electrodynamic and quantum electrodynamic effects .",
