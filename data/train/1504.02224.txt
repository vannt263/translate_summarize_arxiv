    "the energy content of turbulence is usually characterized by the energy distribution among spatial scales , either in physical or in fourier space . for rotating , stratified , or magnetohydrodynamic turbulence  @xcite",
    ", waves can propagate and coexist with `` classical '' eddies and coherent structures , which advocates for a spatio - temporal description of such flows .",
    "while temporal fluctuations are usually slaved to the spatial ones via sweeping effects in classical turbulence  @xcite , they are expected to be governed by the dispersion relation of the waves for time scales much smaller than the eddy turnover time .",
    "the latter regime is the subject of wave turbulence theory , in which the assumption of weak nonlinear coupling between waves allows to predict scaling laws for the spatial energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it is a matter of debate whether wave turbulence theory ( also known as weak turbulence theory ) is a good candidate to describe rotating turbulence in the rapidly rotating limit .",
    "solutions to the linearized rotating euler equation can be decomposed into inertial waves , which satisfy the anisotropic dispersion relation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the rotation rate and @xmath2 the component of the wave vector @xmath3 along the rotation axis ( referred to as the vertical axis by convention )  @xcite . accordingly",
    ", only fluid motions at frequencies @xmath4 smaller than the coriolis frequency @xmath5 correspond to wave propagation .",
    "fluid motions of weak amplitude and slowly varying in time ( @xmath6 ) can be described in terms of waves with nearly horizontal wave vectors : they tend to be two - dimensional and three - component ( 2d3c ) , invariant along the rotation axis , a result known as the taylor - proudman theorem .",
    "the trend towards two - dimensionality is a landmark in rotating turbulence , observed both in experiments and numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "it originates from the modification of the nonlinear interactions by the coriolis force , which yields preferential energy transfers towards modes with almost horizontal wave vectors  @xcite . in the frequency domain",
    ", this corresponds to the generation of slow dynamics compared to the characteristic frequency at which energy is supplied to the system .",
    "these anisotropic energy transfers can be accounted for in terms of resonant and near - resonant triadic interactions of inertial waves  @xcite .",
    "a major feature of rotating turbulence is the emergence of inverse energy transfers in the horizontal plane  @xcite .",
    "inverse transfers between 3d fast `` wave '' modes and the 2d slow `` vortex '' mode , mediated by near - resonant triadic interactions , are allowed at finite rossby number only  @xcite . the 2d mode is therefore fed either from the coupling with the 3d modes at finite rossby number , or from direct energy input by the forcing",
    "one naturally expects the energy within this 2d mode to undergo an inverse energy cascade , similar to that of classical ( non - rotating ) 2d turbulence  @xcite .",
    "such coexistence between 2d and 3d flows is relevant to most experiments and numerical simulations , and can not be accounted for by wave turbulence theory , which describes the _ direct _ energy cascade arising from resonant triadic interactions of 3d wave modes only  @xcite .",
    "this theory therefore provides only a partial description of rotating turbulence in realistic systems , and careful experimental and numerical studies remain necessary to assess its range of validity .",

    "the belief is that , provided the experimental tank is deep enough , the bulk turbulent flow away from the top and bottom boundaries should resemble the one obtained in the ideal 3d periodic or stress - free domains considered in most numerical and theoretical studies .",
    "closer to the horizontal walls , the boundary layers induce ekman friction that is not taken into account by most numerical studies .    in the laboratory , the energy dissipation of rotating turbulent flows originates from three main contributions : bulk viscous dissipation of 3d flow structures , bulk viscous dissipation of quasi-2d flow structures ( somewhat similar to the bulk energy dissipation of 2d turbulence ) , and dissipation through ekman friction on the horizontal boundaries .    in spite of the importance of the 2d mode in most geophysical and laboratory flows , the 3d fluctuations still play a crucial role in the dynamics of rotating turbulence , because they are much more efficient at dissipating energy .",
    "this key feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : evsw ] , from data obtained in the present experiment ( setup sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : su ] ; see sec .  [ secebudget ] for details ) : we decompose the turbulent velocity field into a vertically - averaged 2d flow and a vertically - dependent 3d remainder , and show the corresponding energies and energy dissipation rates as a function of global rotation . for maximum rotation , although the 3d component contains a small fraction of the total kinetic energy , its dissipation rate is as large as that of the vertically - invariant 2d component",
    ". moreover , both of these dissipations are larger than an estimate of the frictional losses due to laminar ekman layers ( see sec .  [ secebudget ] ) .",
    "an accurate description of the 3d structures of the flow is therefore essential to characterize the energy fluxes in rotating turbulence at moderate rossby number .",
    "a primary goal in this direction is to determine the range of scales and frequencies for which 3d fluctuations follow the inertial - wave dispersion relation .",
    "this requires a full spatio - temporal analysis , which is very demanding in general for wave - turbulence systems : the accessible range of scales is usually limited in experiments , whereas long integration times are prohibitive in numerical simulations .",
    "the case of rotating turbulence is particularly delicate because of the specific form of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : iwdr ] ) : the frequency is not related to the wave number , as in conventional isotropic wave systems such as surface waves  @xcite or elastic waves  @xcite , but to the wave vector orientation only .",

    "@xcite and yarom and sharon  @xcite constitute important steps forward in this respect . using numerical simulation of rotating turbulence",
    "forced at large scale , clark di leoni _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite observe a clear concentration of energy along the dispersion relation of inertial waves , and provide a detailed analysis of the various time scales of the system .",
    "they observe a wave - dominated regime at large scale and a sweeping - dominated regime at small scale ( see also ref .  @xcite ) . in the experiment of yarom and sharon  @xcite the forcing consists of a random set of sources and sinks at the bottom of a rotating water tank .",
    "they measure three - dimensional two - component ( 3d2c ) velocity fields using a scanning particle image velocimetry ( piv ) technique , and observe also a good agreement with the inertial wave dispersion relation . in both refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the inertial waves are observed at scales smaller than the injection scale , suggesting that they are fed by forward energy transfers , which is consistent with the predictions of wave turbulence theory .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to further analyze experimentally the range of spatio - temporal scales at which inertial waves can be detected in rotating turbulence .",
    "stationary rotating turbulence is produced by a set of vortex dipole generators which continuously inject turbulent fluctuations towards the center of a rotating water tank where measurements are performed .",
    "we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that this configuration generates a double energy cascade at large rotation rate : an inverse cascade of horizontal energy and a direct cascade of vertical energy , which behaves approximately as a passive scalar advected by the horizontal flow . here",
    "we perform a detailed spatio - temporal analysis using two - point spatial correlations of the temporal fourier modes computed from time - resolved two - dimensional three - component ( 2d3c ) velocity fields measured by stereoscopic piv in a vertical plane .",
    "we observe that , at large scales and frequencies , the spatio - temporal anisotropy of the energy distribution is well described by the dispersion relation of inertial waves , whereas smaller scales are dominated by the sweeping of the waves by the energetic large - scale flow .",
    "the experimental setup , sketched in fig .  [ fig : su ] , is similar to the one described in refs .",
    "@xcite and is only briefly described here .",
    "it consists of a @xmath10  @xmath11 glass tank , filled with @xmath12  cm of water and mounted on a 2  m - diameter rotating platform which rotates at a rate @xmath1 in the range @xmath13 to @xmath14  rad  s@xmath15 ( @xmath16 to @xmath17  rpm ) .",
    "turbulence is produced in the rotating frame by a set of ten vertical vortex dipole generators organized as a circular arena of 85  cm diameter around the center of the water tank .",
    "this forcing device was initially designed to generate turbulence in stratified fluids , and is described in detail in refs .",
    "each generator consists of a pair of vertical flaps , 60  cm high and @xmath18  cm long , alternatively closing rapidly and opening slowly in a cyclic motion of period @xmath19  s. the closing stage is achieved with the flaps rotating at an angular velocity @xmath20  rad  s@xmath15 , and a random phase shift is applied between the generators .    in the laminar regime ,",
    "a single pair of flaps generates vortex dipoles with core vorticity @xmath21 .",
    "additional piv measurements close to a vortex dipole generator indicate that this core vorticity is governed by the vorticity in the viscous boundary layer of the flap , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the flap velocity and @xmath24 the viscous boundary layer thickness . in the present experiment ,",
    "the vortex dipoles are unstable , and the closing of the flaps therefore produces small - scale 3d turbulent fluctuations that are advected towards the center of the arena by the remaining large - scale dipolar structure .",
    "the turbulent reynolds number , computed from the rms velocity and the horizontal integral scale , is about 400 in the center of the flow , and the turbulent rossby number covers the range @xmath25 for @xmath26  rpm  @xcite .",
    "we measure the three components of the velocity field @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 oriented vertically , along the rotation axis ) in a vertical square domain of size @xmath29  @xmath7 located at the center of the circular arena at mid - depth , using a stereoscopic piv system  @xcite embarked on the rotating platform .",
    "these 2d3c ( two - dimensional three - component ) velocity fields are sampled on a grid of @xmath30  vectors with a spatial resolution of @xmath31  mm . two acquisition sets are recorded for each rotation rate @xmath1 : one set of 10000 fields at 0.35  hz and one set of 1000 fields at 1.5  hz .",
    "the combination of these two time series results in a temporal spectral range of three decades .",
    "in the present experiment , energy is primarily injected in the 2d mode ( vertically invariant ) , but the instabilities in the vicinity of the flaps rapidly feed 3d fluctuations which are advected in the central region .",
    "energy transfers between the 2d and 3d flow components , which vanish in the weak turbulence limit ( @xmath32 ) , are allowed in our system because of the moderate value of the rossby number .",
    "it is therefore of first interest to quantify the energy contained in the 2d and 3d components of the flow .",
    "we estimate the vertically - averaged 2d flow as the average of the velocity field over the vertical extent @xmath33 of the piv field , @xmath34 and the remaining @xmath35-dependent 3d flow as @xmath36 .",
    "we compute the energy per unit mass of these two flow components as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the temporal average and @xmath40 the spatial average over the piv field .",
    "they are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : evsw](a ) as a function of the rotation rate @xmath1 . because of the limited height of the piv field , the 2d flow estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : u2d ] ) unavoidably contains 3d fluctuations associated to vertical scales larger than @xmath33 , so the measured 2d energy may overestimate the true one .",
    "figure  [ fig : evsw](a ) shows that without rotation the 2d and 3d components of the flow have comparable energy . with rotation , the 2d energy increases with @xmath1 , following approximately the power law @xmath41  @xcite , whereas the 3d energy remains approximately constant , and represents only 5% of the total energy at the largest rotation rate .",
    "although most of the energy is contained in the 2d flow component for @xmath42 , a significant fraction of the dissipation still arises from the 3d fluctuations .",
    "assuming axisymmetry , we compute an estimate of the energy dissipation rate @xmath43 from the 6 terms of the velocity gradient tensor accessible in the 3c2d measurements , @xmath44 this dissipation rate , computed both for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evsw](b ) .",
    "since the derivatives are obtained from finite differences at the smallest resolved scale , the computed dissipation underestimates the true one ( the piv resolution is @xmath31  mm while the kolmogorov scale is of order of 0.6  mm  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we expect the measured evolution of @xmath47 with @xmath1 to reflect the true one .",
    "we first compare these bulk energy dissipation rates to an estimate of frictional losses due to laminar ekman layers , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the root - mean - square horizontal velocity .",
    "this estimate ranges from @xmath50  m@xmath51  s@xmath52 for @xmath53 rpm to @xmath54  m@xmath51  s@xmath52 for @xmath55 rpm : it is smaller than the bulk energy dissipation of both the 2d and 3d parts of the turbulent flow , by a factor of 10 for slow rotation and 4 for rapid rotation .",
    "a detailed experimental characterization of these ekman layers would be necessary to validate the assumption of laminar layers , but it is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we now compare the bulk energy dissipation rates in the 2d and 3d parts of the turbulent flow . remarkably , while the 3d fluctuations represent a small fraction of the total energy , they account for a large fraction of the dissipation at all rotation rates .",
    "it is therefore of first interest to investigate these 3d modes , and to determine to what extent they can be described in terms of inertial waves .",

    "this decomposition highlights the frequency - dependent _ componentality _ of turbulence , i.e. , the distribution of energy among the different velocity components , which is related to the _ polarization anisotropy _",
    "this is not to be confused with the frequency - dependent _ dimensionality _ of turbulence , which compares the vertical and horizontal characteristic scales at a given frequency ( described in section  [ sec : sta ] ) .",

    "there is actually a slight over - representation of horizontal energy , a consequence of the forcing device geometry which preferentially injects energy in horizontal motions . as the rotation rate increases , the high frequencies remain nearly isotropic ( iso - component ) , whereas the low frequencies become gradually anisotropic , with @xmath72 nearly flat and @xmath75 approaching a power law close to @xmath68 .",
    "this anisotropy is related to the fact that , as @xmath1 increases , the decorrelation frequency ( i.e. , the frequency below which the spectrum becomes flat ) gets significantly smaller for the horizontal velocity ( @xmath76 ) than for the vertical velocity ( @xmath77 , increasing from @xmath78 to @xmath79  rad  s@xmath15 for @xmath1 from @xmath16 to @xmath17  rpm ) . for the largest rotation rate ( @xmath55  rpm ) ,",

    "interestingly , we also observe a small frequency domain @xmath89 over which energy in the vertical component is slightly larger than in each horizontal component .",

    "the horizontal velocity consequently exhibits slow dynamics , while the vertical velocity fluctuations are found at higher frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eperppar ] ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the usual phenomenology of rapidly rotating turbulence : the flow becomes approximately 2d at low - frequency , and the vertical velocity behaves as a passive scalar , which is stretched and folded by the horizontal velocity .",
    "this produces thin vertical layers swept by the horizontal flow , yielding rapidly changing time series of the vertical velocity . in a similar fashion ,",

    "this is the low-@xmath154 behavior in figure  [ fig : collaps ] .",
    "by contrast , when focusing on low frequencies @xmath4 or small - scales in the frame of the tank , one measures the inertial waves with intrinsic frequency @xmath161 , but one also detects many waves with @xmath162 that are doppler - shifted back to frequency @xmath4 by the advective term in ( [ eq : sweptiwdr ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy measured at low - frequency @xmath4 therefore results from strongly swept inertial waves with various intrinsic frequencies , and the information from the dispersion relation ( [ eq : iwdr ] ) is lost in the space - time correlation .",
    "the limit @xmath160 corresponds to frequencies @xmath4 that are much lower than the inverse advective time . in this @xmath163 limit ,",
    "one detects mostly waves with @xmath164 that are doppler - shifted by the horizontal flow in such a way that they are almost steady in the frame of the tank : this is a @xmath4-independent regime that corresponds to the large-@xmath154 plateau in figure  [ fig : collaps ] .",
    "in the present experiment , the anisotropy of the turbulent energy distribution at a given spatio - temporal scale @xmath165 is well - described by the inertial - wave dispersion relation at high - frequency and/or large - scale only .",
    "the smaller - scale waves are subject to intense sweeping by large - scale turbulent motions contained predominantly in the 2d  vortex \" mode .",
    "this conclusion is compatible with the numerical findings of clark di leoni _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who also identify the sweeping time scale as the relevant decorrelation time at small scale .",
    "such sweeping by the 2d mode has strong implications for wave - turbulence theories .",
    "indeed , most waves do not follow the inertial - wave dispersion relation , and the assumptions of weak turbulence theory break down even at the linear stage in wave amplitude : instead of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : iwdr ] ) , the linear problem consists in determining the evolution of waves embedded in a turbulent 2d flow .",
    "this is a formidable task in general , because the 2d flow is space- and time - dependent : in the discussion of our data , we simplified the problem by assuming that the 2d flow is at much larger scales and slower frequencies than the waves , therefore including it as a simple doppler - shift term in the dispersion relation .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on the dimensionality of the forcing . in the present experiment ,",
    "the flow is driven by vertically invariant flaps : such a quasi-2d forcing device enhances two - dimensionalization and the resulting sweeping of the 3d flow structures .",
    "nevertheless , accumulation of energy in the 2d mode is a robust feature of rotating turbulence , that takes place for arbitrary forcing geometry , even if the forcing does not input energy directly into the 2d mode .",
    "a careful and extensive numerical study of this issue has been recently reported for the fully-3d taylor - green forcing @xcite : for rapid global rotation and low viscosity , energy accumulates in the 2d mode until the rossby number based on the velocity of this 2d flow is of order unity .",
    "if these findings are confirmed , the sweeping of the most energetic 3d structures would be an inevitable outcome of this accumulation of 2d energy .",

    "the two - point velocity correlation at frequency @xmath4 ( [ eq : r ] ) can be written @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the space average , and @xmath170 is a separation vector inside the piv plane . introducing spherical coordinates with vertical polar axis , we denote @xmath171 the azimuthal angle between @xmath3 and the vertical piv plane .",
