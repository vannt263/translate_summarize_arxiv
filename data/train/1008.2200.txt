    "wide - field surveys have now identified nearly a thousand ultracool dwarfs ( spectral types later than m6 ) in the solar neighborhood , spanning temperatures and ( inferred ) masses that range from the stellar / substellar boundary defined by the hydrogen - burning minimum mass ( @xmath575  ) , down to the proposed substellar / planetary boundary demarcated by the deuterium - burning limit ( @xmath513  ) .",
    "this census has enabled extensive characterization of the spectrophotometric properties of these low - luminosity , low - temperature objects .",

    "the final flux ratios were used to correct the strehl ratio measurements of the images for the contamination from the light of the secondary component . we did not correct the relative astrometry for instrumental optical distortion , as the size of the effect as predicted from a distortion solution by b. cameron ( priv . comm . )",
