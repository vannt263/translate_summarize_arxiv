    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) in solid - state physics has drawn much attention over the last decade as a candidate for quantum information processing.@xcite due to their weak environmental coupling , nuclear spins have very long coherence times .",
    "nmr measurements of nuclear spins , however , are challenging unless bulk samples are used , which results in inhomogeneous broadening of the nmr signal . in semiconductor devices , where thermal polarization of nuclei is weak ,",
    "nmr signals can be significantly enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) , a mechanism by which an electron transition between two spin - resolved energy states , or `` spin - flip '' , is mediated by a reverse `` spin - flop '' in the nuclear system .",
    "energy conservation makes this process difficult because the energy associated with the orientation of an electron is three orders of magnitude larger than that of a nucleus .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by employing different techniques , such as microwave - induced dnp,@xcite optical pumping,@xcite inter - edge - channel scattering in the quantum hall regime,@xcite electron spin resonance,@xcite quantum hall ferromagnetism@xcite or the breakdown of the integer quantum hall effect ( qhe).@xcite as recently demonstrated,@xcite multiple quantum coherence in a nanometer - scale device can be achieved by dnp .",
    "in addition , coherence times of tens of seconds have been observed in bulk si crystals at room temperature , although thermal equilibration times of the order of hours make averaging over several acquisitions impractical.@xcite    in this paper , we describe a technique for all - electrical coherent control of nuclear spins in a nanometre - scale based on the breakdown of the qhe in a quantum wire ( qw ) .",
    "this technique presents a number of advantadges over previous experiments : quantum coherence survives up to 1.2 k for times of the order of a millisecond with a relatively simple sample design and without extreme demands on sample quality .",

    "the hyperfine interaction between electrons and nuclei allows for a spin change in the nuclear system to preserve total angular momentum , in a process that occurs locally where the electron spin - flip is induced . as more such scattering events occur , the dnp builds up and affects the energy structure of the electron system by creating an effective hyperfine field that adds to the external magnetic field , thus changing the electron zeeman energy . in our experiment ,",

    "the rf radiation at the nmr frequency randomizes the nuclei , eliminating the hyperfine field , and the corresponding change in zeeman energy is observed in the conductance . at 5.2 t , where the strongest nmr signal is observed ,",
    "we observed dnp thresholds for the relaxation [ figure [ f3](a ) ] and nmr [ figure [ f3](b ) ] measurements,(a ) , we waited for 5 minutes ( to ensure zero nuclear polarization at @xmath19 s ) before applying the excitation voltage in the relaxation measurements . ] finding that nuclear polarization occurred for excitation voltages higher than about 40 @xmath0v .",

    "other possibilities could be low - voltage breakdown of the quantum hall effect@xcite or electron correlation effects from edge states in narrow channels.@xcite    all data presented in the remainder of this paper were taken at 5.2 t. in figure [ f4 ] we can see the effect of applying a dc voltage along with the ac excitation .",
