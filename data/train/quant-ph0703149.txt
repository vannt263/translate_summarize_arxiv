    "in nano - lithography the optical control of atomic motion is one of the main problems . in principle",
    ", we can make such a control for atom dynamics because there is an exchange of momentum between the atoms and the optical fields .",
    "the momentum exchange can be created with practical devices : atomic mirrors and atomic beam splitters which are main elements of atomic interferometer .",
    "the most interesting possibility here is to obtain the splitting of the initial atomic wave packet coherently into two main momentum components only by controllable way .",
    "it is needed both for increasing of atomic interferometer sensitivity and for the creation of periodic nano - structures by atomic wave packet lithography @xcite .",
    "previously , successful splitting of an atomic wave packet has been achieved by using raman pulses , magneto - optical beam splitter , diffraction in an optical standing wave , adiabatic passage .",
    "more recently , coherent splitting has been realized by scattering of an atomic wave packet in standing wave with modulated intensity @xcite and by using chirped standing wave fields @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we concentrate on the possibility to split an atomic wave packet in standing wave with modulated amplitude because this beam - splitter has a number of advantages by comparing with others .",
    "the first one is the simplicity for an experimental realization because it is quite easy to obtain the time modulation of intensity with any shape .",
    "the second advantage is that the scale splitting of an atomic wave packet can be controlled by changing the values of both an amplitude and the frequency of the modulation .",
    "actually , we demonstrate for small interaction time , which is required for clear and large splitting , the beam - splitting effect @xmath0 with summarized relative intensity in both main components about 50 per cent from initial intensity of the atomic beam .",
    "+ the principal opportunity to split the beam in the momentum space was demonstrated in @xcite . to achieve the effective splitting ,",
    "we apply the scheme of open - loop control , or feed - forward control , i.e. a control signal depends only on the time .",
    "our control goal is to obtain the large angle splitting for the initial wave packet after some time of the interaction between the atoms and the field of modulated standing wave .",
    "atom lithography is an active field now a days .",
    "the resolution of an optical lithography technology is limited by diffraction , which for the case of deep ultraviolet light approaches 200 nm . the progress of recent device technology requires smaller patterning of 10 nm size . however , when one tries to make very small devices , the resolution of the resistance is limited by the spread of the secondary electron in an electron beam lithography , as well as in x - ray lithography .",
    "+ the ability to generate ultracold atoms using lasers has opened up new possibilities .",
    "the long de broglie wave of cold atoms makes possible an interferometric manipulation with atomic wave packets , which is designed by an optical standing wave . in this case",
    ", atoms can be controlled directly to form a desired pattern . to produce the pattern with high resolution",
    ", we need to split the wave packet into two coherent momentum components only . for the model with only two states ( i.e. an approximation of two level atom states )",
    ", we have to split the population of the lower state ( because the population of the exited state usually loses the coherency very fast by spontaneous decay ) in several momentum components ( in an ideal case  only two ) . at the same time to form the pattern with small step we need to control the scale of splitting between two main coherent components in momentum space .",
    "therefore , an atomic beam splitter is the main element for the practical realization of nano - scale lithography with the controlled step by coherent scattering of an atomic wave packet .",
    "+ let s consider now a two level atom in a far detuned standing wave with the intensity modulated in time as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an amplitude , @xmath3 is the frequency of the modulation , and @xmath4 is an initial modulation phase . the standing wave with the frequency @xmath5 applies between two states of atom system , where the state 1 is ground and the state 2 is the exited one . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the frequency of atom transition and the difference @xmath7 is the detuning .",
    "we will assume that the beam from an atom source propagates along @xmath8-axis and crosses the optical wave , standing along @xmath9-axis , by right angle .",
    "the spontaneous emission from the upper level in this system can not be neglected . after some time @xmath10 of the interactions between the atoms and the field of the standing wave",
    ", the initial atomic wave packet is splitted in few coherent momentum components .",
    "+ dynamics of the atom in the modulated standing wave is described with nonstationary schr@xmath11dinger equation for the wave function @xmath12 of the two level atom : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a hamiltonian which takes into account both the atom movement along the standing wave and the dipole interaction between the atom and the optical field .",
    "for sufficiently large detuning , when it is much larger than rabi frequency and the natural width of the atomic transition , @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the rabi frequency , @xmath17 is the natural width of the transition ) , the excited state 2 can be adiabatically eliminated . as the result",
    ", we obtain the equation for the amplitude of the probability of the ground state @xmath18 : @xmath19^{2}\\mathrm{cos}^{2}(kx)\\psi _ { 1}(x , t),\\    \\label{2}\\ ] ] and @xmath20 is the atom mass .",

    "we have to point out that equations ( 2)-(3 ) are valid in the approximation when both the changing of atom momentum along @xmath8-axis and the initial value along @xmath9-axis can be neglected .",
    "to explain the effect of splitting in the momentum space we start from the case of parametric control with a constant @xmath27 .",
    "we invent a complex shell model for @xmath28-function .",
    "initially the atomic beam has a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath29 .",
    "thus , from the structure of the rhs ( 3 ) we can expect the non - zero meanings of @xmath28 functions to be concentrated in the neighborhoods of the points @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "then we can predict the continuous dependency on @xmath32 with the discrete number @xmath33 : @xmath34 .",

    "the corresponding population amplitudes of the shells @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by : @xmath48 surely , the normalization @xmath49 is saved for any moment @xmath39 .",
    "now we can see that in the 3-shell model the regular splitting is realized when the time @xmath50 , @xmath51 the same effect can be reproduced in the case of five shells . to simplify the final expression",

    "the splitting effect is obtained , when @xmath59 , then the population of the @xmath60 shells is : @xmath61 , and in the same time @xmath62 and @xmath63 only ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "however , if the number @xmath33 of a shell is increased such that @xmath64 ( i.e. for @xmath65 we have @xmath66 ) , then @xmath67 in ( 4 ) can be excluded as a small parameter , and for the elder shells @xmath68 this function is almost independent of the neighbor shells and it has the solution @xmath69 but @xmath70 for any @xmath71 , thus , the elder shells do not participate in the re - distribution of the initial gaussian population .",
    "thus , the simple parametric control with the fixed @xmath27 is not enough to split the beam efficiently .",
    "another scheme of time - dependent @xmath27 ( corresponding to the most general open - loop control ) should be applied .",
    "now let us consider the two level atom in a far detuned standing wave with an intensity , which is modulated in time harmonically as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the amplitude and @xmath74 is the frequency of the modulation .",

    "fig.2 shows the numerical solution of an equation for amplitude of the probability of ground state @xmath79 in momentum representation for the cases unmodulated and modulated standing wave .",
    "we assume that initial wave packet has the width equals @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "as we can see from this picture , the scattering result strongly depends on the amplitude modulation exiting in this system . if for an unmodulated case , it is well - known scattering picture observed ( fig.2 ) , when an initial wave packet is splitted into a number of momentum components .",
    "however , for modulated standing wave the scattering picture is changing dramatically and two main momentum components centered on @xmath83 can be observed ( fig.3 )",
    ". such behavior of the momentum components is due to specific parametric resonance , which occurs in this system by the well defined amplitude and frequency modulation .",
    "we have to point out that the values of the modulation obtained for the amplitude and frequency modulation are strongly different from @xcite , and we can interpret such resonances as bragg resonances of high orders in modulated standing wave .",
