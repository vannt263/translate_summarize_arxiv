    "the study of multiquark states is one of the most active frontiers since the establishment of the quark model by gell - mann and zweig  @xcite .",
    "jaffe was the first to carry out quantitative studies  @xcite , and lipkin extended the idea to pentaquarks  @xcite . as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) does not forbid the existence of pentaquark states .",
    "recently , the discovery of hidden charm pentaquark candidates was reported by lhcb  @xcite , and it invoked a renewed interest in this field  @xcite .    it is pointed out by brodsky , schmidt , and de  tramond that the qcd van de waals interaction , mediated by multi - gluon exchanges , will dominate the interaction between two hadrons when they have no common quarks  @xcite .",
    "it was further shown by luke , manohar , and savage that the qcd van de waals force is enhanced at low relative velocities between the two  @xcite .",
    "this finding supports the prediction that a nucleon / nucleus - charmonium bound state can be produced near the charm production threshold . as an analogy ,",
    "a @xmath1 bound state is predicted by gao , lee , and marinov  @xcite .",
    "it is also pointed out that the subthreshold quasifree @xmath2 meson photoproduction inside a nuclear medium will enhance the probability for the formation of the @xmath1 bound state .",
    "in addition , some chiral quark model calculation  @xcite and lattice qcd calcualtion  @xcite in recent years also support the existence of such kind of bound state . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath1 bound state can be viewed as a hidden strange pentaquark state . a comparison with the hidden charm pentaquark candidates will unveil the flavor dependent effect in hadron physics .",
    "thus the experimental search for the @xmath1 bound state is of great interest and will improve our understanding of the strong interaction .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out a front - to - end study of the search for the @xmath1 bound state .",
    "we perform a calculation with the quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm )  @xcite , which is developed aiming to understand the similarities between nuclear and molecular forces despite different scales . in this model ,",
    "the intermediate - range attraction is achieved by the quark delocalization , which is like the electron percolation in molecules .",
    "the color screening provides an effective description of the hidden color channel coupling  @xcite , and leads to the possibility of the quark delocalization .",
    "the qdcsm has been utilized to investigate the baryon - baryon scattering phase shifts in the framework of the resonating group method ( rgm ) .",
    "it provides a good description of the nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - hyperon interactions and the deuteron properties  @xcite .",
    "some dibaryon candidates are also studied with this model  @xcite .",
    "the one of particular interest is a narrow resonance @xmath3 state  @xcite , which is proposed for searches in heavy ion collisions and a hadron beam experiment with a newly developed automatic scanning system  @xcite .",
    "moreover the hidden charm pendaquark candidates , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bound states , are also studied in qdcsm  @xcite . as the strangeness counterpart",
    ", we study the hidden strange system with a light baryon and a light meson in the qdcsm .",
    "some baryon - meson bound states are found from the model calculation , and one of them is the @xmath1 bound state .",
    "the decay properties of this bound state are calculated from the phase shifts of the resonance scatterings . to investigate the feasibility of an experimental search for this bound state , we study the production of this bound state from the near threshold @xmath2 production process in a nuclear medium as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "particularly , we choose a gold target as an example , and perform a monte carlo simulation with electron beams at jefferson lab and detectors in hall b. events with scattered electrons detected by the forward tagger  @xcite and @xmath6 detected by the clas12  @xcite and the bonus12  @xcite are selected to reconstruct the bound state .",
    "both the signal and the background are estimated in the simulation . with a set of momentum cuts motivated by the previous study  @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate that the signal events can be separated from the background .",
    "therefore it is possible to search for the @xmath1 bound state in experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we briefly introduce the quark delocalization color screening model , and then we calculate the properies of the hidden strange baryon - meson system in section  [ sec3 ] . focusing on the @xmath1 bound state , we investigate the production process , and perform a simulation to show the feasibility of the experimental search for this state in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the discussion and the conclusion are drawn in the last section .",
    "the quark delocalization effect is realized by specifying the single particle orbital wave function in qdcsm as a linear combination of left and right gaussians as @xmath35 where @xmath36 the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , are the generating coordinates , which are introduced to expand the relative motion wave function  @xcite .",
    "the mixing parameter @xmath39 is variationally determined by the dynamics of the multiquark system .",
    "this procedure allows the multiquark system to choose its favorable configuration with the interactions , and has been used to explain the cross - over transition between the hadron phase and the quark - gluon plasma phase  @xcite . in order to test the sensitivity of the model parameters , three sets of parameters , labeled as qdcsm1 , qdcsm2 , and qdcsm3 ,",
    "are used in the calculations as listed in table  [ parameters ] . the set in qdcsm1",
    "is taken from the work of dibaryons  @xcite , the one in qdcsm2 is obtained by fitting the spectra of ground state mesons , and the one in qdcsm3 is obtained by fitting the spectra of ground state baryons and mesons .",
    ".three sets of model parameters discussed in this work : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46.[parameters ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is pointed out in  @xcite that the subthreshold production of @xmath2 meson inside a nuclear medium will enhance the probability of the formation of the @xmath1 bound state . in this section ,",
    "we take a gold target as an example to study the production of the @xmath47 bound state , and show the feasibility of the experimental search by simulation . for simplicity",
    ", we will only present the results with the parameter set of qdcsm2 , and similar results are expected with the other two parameter sets .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ feyndiag ] , the reaction takes place in two steps .",
    "firstly the @xmath2 meson is producted from a nucleon in a nuclear medium , and then it interacts with another nucleon around to form the bound state @xmath47 .",
    "the amplitude of the formation of the bound state can be calculated from the effective potential @xmath48 and the radial wave function @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the incoming momentum of the @xmath2 meson in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath52 system .",
    "using the effective potential and the wave function in fig .",

    "the @xmath51 is the relative momentum of the @xmath52 system .",
    "[ fq],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for the @xmath2 meson production , the amplitude is extracted from the @xmath2 meson near threshold photoproduction differential cross section data in  @xcite via @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the invariant amplitude , @xmath57 is the relative momentum of the incoming @xmath58 system , and @xmath59 is the relative momentum of the outgoing @xmath60 system .",
    "the @xmath61 represents the polar angle of the produced @xmath2 meson in the center - of - mass frame with respect to the direction of the incoming photon .",
    "the spin dependent effects are neglected here . namely the extracted amplitude is spin averaged .    due to the momentum mismatch , it is not likely to find the @xmath47 bound state in the @xmath2 production from a proton target . with the help of the fermi motion ,",
    "the probability of the bound state formation is expected to be enhanced in the @xmath2 meson sub- or near - threshold production from heavy nuclei",
    ". therefore we choose gold ( @xmath62au ) as the target here .",
    "to describe bound nucleons in a gold nucleus , we extract the momentum and the energy distributions of nucleons inside a gold nucleus from the data in  @xcite . here",
    "we assume an isotropic momentum distribution .",

    "[ sigmaphoton ] , the cross section of @xmath47 photoproduction has a maximum below the threshold @xmath63gev .",
    "this feature is consistent with the calculation in  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the cross section drops with the photon energy above the threshold due to the increasing @xmath60 relative momentum .",
    "bound state photoproduction on a gold target.[sigmaphoton],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to investigate the feasibility of an experimental search for the @xmath47 bound state , we perform a simulation according to the configuration of clas12 at jefferson lab .",
    "based on the calculation in the previous section , the @xmath47 decay is dominated by the @xmath2 meson decay .",
    "thus the bound state can be reconstructed from the @xmath64 channel .",
    "due to the detection issue , we restrict the nucleon in the bound state to be a proton , which means the cross section is divided by a factor of @xmath65 , since the proton and the neutron are not differentiated in our model calculation .",
    "in addition , the two kaons in the final state are required to be @xmath66 because of the difficulty of the @xmath67 detection .",
    "assuming the same branch ratio of the @xmath66 decay channel of the nucleon - bound @xmath2 meson as the one of the free @xmath2 meson , 48.9%  @xcite , we obtain the branch ratio of the @xmath6 decay channel for @xmath47 as 46.5% ( see table  [ width ] ) .    instead of the photoproduction",
    ", we perform the monte carlo simulation of the electroproduction with one photon exchange approximation as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ feyndiag ] , because photon beams will not be readily available for clas12 in hall b at jafferson lab . the forward tagger  @xcite , which covers the polar angle @xmath68 and the energy above 0.5gev , can be used to detect the scattered electron in order to select the low @xmath69 events .",
    "apart from the scattered electron , a triple coincident detection of @xmath6 in the final state is required to reconstruct the @xmath47 bound state .",
    "in addition to the simulation of the signal channel , an estimation of the background is necessary to validate the experimental feasibility . in this study , four background channels are estimated .",
    "the first one is from the same reaction as the @xmath47 production process in fig .",
    "[ feyndiag ] , but the detected proton in the final state is not from the bound state decay .",
    "the second one is the @xmath2 meson production process without the formation of the bound state . as mentioned above ,",
    "the amplitude extracted from the data in  @xcite is used in the simulation of this channel .",
    "the third one is the production of @xmath70 with the @xmath71 decaying into @xmath72 .",
    "similar to the @xmath2 production case , the amplitude of the near threshold production of @xmath70 is extracted from the differential cross section data in  @xcite . in this process ,",
    "the distributions of @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the final state are different .",
    "the fourth one is the direct @xmath66 production near the threshold . in this case , we model the cross section by using the amplitude of @xmath2 production but replacing the mass with the invariant mass of the @xmath66 system . actually the value of this amplitude is not very critical , because we can separate it from the signal as discussed below .    in the monte carlo simulation ,",
    "we choose a 4.4gev electron beam with a 100na beam current and a 0.138 mm thickness gold target .",
    "it corresponds to the luminosity of @xmath75@xmath76s@xmath77 .",
    "the masses of @xmath2 and @xmath71 are sampled according to the breit - wigner distribution .",
    "the particles from decays are generated according to the phase space distribution in the center - of - mass frame and then boosted to the lab frame according to the four momentum of the parent particle . the mass and width of the @xmath47 bound state",
    "is chosen as 1950mev and 4.094mev according to the model calculation results in tables  [ mass ] and  [ width ] . in fig .",
    "[ pkk_vertex ] , the invariant mass spectra of the @xmath6 final state from the signal and the background channels are compared .",
    "one can observe that the signal overlaps with the background in the @xmath6 spectra .",
    "the right panel shows the momentum distributions of the proton and kaon produced from each channel . for better visibility ,",
    "an equal number of points are plotted for each channel , and the density of the points reflects the distribution .",
    "the black and the blue curves or points are from the same reaction process , but the black ones represent the signal channel , and the blue ones represent the first background channel which means the proton is not from the bound state decay.[pkk_vertex],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    system .",

    "[ pkk_vertex ] , we show the two - dimensional distribution of the proton and kaon momenta for each channel .",
    "it is clearly shown that the signal events are in the low momentum region .",
    "therefore we apply the cuts @xmath78mev and @xmath79mev to remove the background events with relatively high momenta .    to improve the detection of the low momentum particles , we propose to use both the clas12 and the bonus12 detectors in hall b at jefferson lab .",
    "the bonus12 is designed to be placed around the target with a polar angle coverage from @xmath80 to @xmath81 to detect low momentum particles  @xcite . in the simulation ,",
    "the bonus12 is set to detect the proton and charged kaons with momenta between 60mev and 200mev .",
    "for particles with momenta below 60mev , we assume no detections , and for particles with momenta above 200mev , we leave it to clas12 for possible detections .",
    "besides , the energy loss in the target is taken into account based on the stopping power data by nist  @xcite , though the effect is negligible when the target is very thin . for clas12 ,",
    "the forward detector covers the polar angle from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , and the central detector covers the polar angle from @xmath83 to @xmath84  @xcite . since the bonus12 is close to the target , the @xmath85 decay effect is neglected if it is detected by bonus12 . however ,",
    "a weighting factor is multiplied by assuming a 2 m traveling distance if the @xmath85 is detected by clas12 . to have more realistic estimation",
    ", we also smear the momentum , the polar angle , and the azimuthal angle of the detected particles according to the detector resolutions  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [",
    "detected ] .",
    "it shows that the momentum cuts significantly reduce the background .",
    "however , the signal rate in the region of @xmath86 drops from 2.0/hour before the momentum cuts to 1.8/hour after the cuts , _",
    "i.e. _ only 10% signal events are removed by these cuts .",

    "we perform a calculation of the hidden strange light baryon - meson system in the qdcsm . by solving the algebraic resonating - group eigenequation ,",
    "two bound states are found as one with @xmath87 dominated by the @xmath88 component and the other one , labeled as @xmath47 , with @xmath89 dominated by the @xmath52 component . comparing with the single channel calculations , we find that the channel coupling effect in the model is important to determine the existence of the bound state",
    ". the decay properties of @xmath47 are calculated from the phase shifts in the resonance scattering processes . as @xmath53 and @xmath2",
    "have no common quarks , a narrow width about @xmath90mev is obtained for @xmath47 .",
    "based on the results of qdcsm , we calculate the @xmath47 photoproduction cross section on a gold target .",
    "as expected , the cross section decreases with increasing photon energy above the @xmath2 production threshold , because the probability of the bound state formation drops as the relative momentum of the @xmath52 system increases .",
    "thus we propose to search for the @xmath47 bound state in the sub- or near - threshold @xmath2 productions from heavy nuclei .",
    "the feasibility of the experimental search for the @xmath47 state is investigated via a simulation using the electron beam at jefferson lab and a forward tagger , the clas12 , and the bonus12 detectors .",
    "as concluded from the model calculation , the @xmath47 decay is dominated by the @xmath2 meson decay .",
    "the @xmath47 state can be reconstructed from the @xmath6 events .",
    "the background channels with the same final state particles are also estimated .",
    "we show that the signal events can be separated from the background by applying a set of cuts to select relatively low momentum events .",
    "the cuts will significantly reject the background events with a cost of losing only about 10% of signal events . assuming a total detector efficiency of 50% , the signal rate estimated from the simulation is about 0.9/hour .",
    "therefore it is feasible to search for the @xmath47 bound state .",
    "if the photon beam is available for clas12 in future , the photoproduction can serve as a complementary approach .",
    "other facilities apart from those at jefferson lab may also have the possibility to search for the bound state .",
    "we should also emphasize that the estimation is only based on a model calculations .",
    "although the qdcsm is proven successful in many situations , one can never claim the existance of the @xmath47 bound state unless it is discovered experimentally .",
    "even if it exists , the mass and the width may also deviate from the model predictions .",
    "together with the hidden charm pentaquark candidates discovered by lhcb , the investigations of this hidden strange pentaquark candidate @xmath47 may unravel the flavor dependent properties and the structures of multiquark states .",
    "it will not only test the qdcsm and other phenomenological models , but also help advance our understanding of the strong interaction . besides , the experimental search of the hidden strange pentaquark candidates is not a trivial extension of the hidden charm pentaquark states , because up to now almost all discovered multiquark states or candidates contain heavy quark components .",
    "the experimental exploration of light multiquark states is of unique significance to understand the structure of multiquark states .",
    "therefore it deserves the efforts from both theories and experiments .",
