    "the anomalous breaking of the flavor singlet axial symmetry of qcd , @xmath0 , has important physical consequences .",
    "it is responsible for the relatively large mass of the @xmath1 @xcite , @xcite and effects the order of the finite temperature phase transition @xcite . a central role in this",
    "is played by the index theorem @xcite which relates the winding of the gauge field with the number of zero modes of the dirac operator .    on the lattice",
    "the winding of the gauge field can not be defined unambiguously and the index of a finite - dimensional lattice dirac operator is necessarily zero .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the index theorem is not valid on the lattice .",
    "however , an approximate form of this theorem may still be present and govern anomalous effects . some time ago",
    "this issue was investigated in @xcite for the case of staggered and wilson fermions .",
    "a first step in that direction was to ask to what extent the lattice dirac operator for staggered and wilson fermions develops the appropriate number of zero modes for a fixed smooth gauge field background with given winding .",
    "it was found that for a particular background the appropriate number of zero modes was generated but they were not robust when high frequency noise was superimposed .",
    "furthermore , the background chosen was of a very special nature and did not have the spatial variation present , for example , in an instanton - like background .",
    "recent work @xcite , with more realistic instanton - like backgrounds , has demonstrated that staggered fermions do not develop zero modes unless the lattice spacing , @xmath2 , becomes very small ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the instanton diameter ) .",
    "these difficulties suggest that for qcd , staggered fermions may fail to reproduce anomalous effects unless the lattice spacing is made quite small  considerably smaller than that used in present qcd thermodynamics studies , performed with @xmath5 and staggered fermions .",
    "current numerical results for the order of the finite temperature phase transition for two flavor qcd with light quarks show that it is not first order @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis in @xcite , provided @xmath0 is broken .",
    "however , current lattice discretizations manifestly break the symmetry of the classical action at finite lattice spacing and the corresponding discretized dirac operators have difficulty seeing zero modes for non - smooth topological configurations .",
    "this raises the possibility that the present apparent second - order character of the two - flavor qcd phase transition may be a result of lattice artifacts rather than physical , anomalous symmetry breaking . a recent explicit calculation of an anomalous difference of susceptibilities near the two - flavor qcd phase transition , using a spectral sum - rule sensitive to zero modes , showed effects at or below the 15% level @xcite .",
    "however , in other work @xcite , suggestions of anomalous zero - mode effects were seen .",
    "clearly , a lattice fermion formulation whose action has the full global symmetry content of the continuum theory at finite lattice spacing would be a very useful tool for studying anomalous symmetry breaking effects .",
    "a novel approach with spectacular zero mode properties has been developed during the past few years .",
    "domain wall fermions were first introduced in @xcite and a variant suitable for vector gauge theories was introduced in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( for reviews see @xcite and references therein . ) in this approach an extra space time dimension ( henceforth to be called `` @xmath6 '' ) is introduced with free boundary conditions on the two four - dimensional boundaries , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the extent of this new fifth dimension in lattice units .",
    "the fermion fields are defined in this extended space - time but the gauge fields are still defined on the ordinary space time and have no @xmath6 dependence and no @xmath6 component @xcite . in this sense , the extra direction can be thought of as a sophisticated `` flavor '' space . along the @xmath6 direction",
    "the fermion field develops surface modes that are exponentially bound to the two free boundaries ( domain walls ) with the plus chirality component of the dirac spinor on one boundary and the minus chirality on the other . as the size in lattice spacings ( @xmath9 ) of this direction",
    "is increased the two chiral components get separated with only an exponentially small overlap remaining . for finite @xmath9 this overlap breaks chiral symmetry by an exponentially small amount and as @xmath9 tends to infinity chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 provides a new parameter that can be used to control the regularization induced chiral symmetry breaking at _ any _ lattice spacing .",
    "for the first time the approach to the chiral limit has been separated from the approach to the continuum limit .",
    "an appealing aspect of the domain wall fermion formulation is the fact that the chirally symmetric , @xmath10 limit can be analyzed in some detail using the overlap formalism @xcite .",
    "central to this overlap method are two fock space states , designated @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the notation of @xcite , constructed from four - dimensional , single - particle , fermionic states . because the gauge field is independent of @xmath6 , it is possible to develop an @xmath6-independent transfer matrix ( @xmath13 ) and associated hamiltonian along this direction .",
    "now in the @xmath10 limit , @xmath14 becomes a projection operator onto the vacuum state , defined as @xmath11 , the fock - space state in which all the negative energy states of @xmath15 are filled .",
    "the second state @xmath12 is a much simpler , kinematic construction in which all single - particle eigenstates of position and @xmath16 , with negative @xmath16 eigenvalue , are filled .    a fermion green s function for a given gauge field background",
    "can then be expressed as a simple matrix element of the appropriate number of creation and annihilation operators inserted between the states @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the five - dimensional fermion determinant in the massless case is simply proportional to @xmath17 which , for a finite space - time volume , can be calculated explicitly numerically . if the number of filled levels in @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the same then @xmath18 .",
    "however , if these filling levels differ , then @xmath19 for zero mass and finite volume .",
    "this implies the presence of exact zero modes in the five - dimensional formulation . for a green s function to be non - zero ,",
    "an appropriate number of creation and annihilation operators must be inserted to balance the deficit .",
    "the deficit is naturally integer - valued and is defined as the index of the lattice dirac operator .",
    "therefore , this method provides a way to associate an index with the lattice fermion operator in the limit @xmath20 but at fixed lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "more specifically it was found @xcite , @xcite that for classical backgrounds these zero modes are exact , that the deficit is equal to the winding of the gauge field and that they exhibit all the properties that are expected in the continuum .",
    "it was also found in @xcite that these modes are robust under the addition of high frequency noise .",
    "using the overlap formalism , numerical simulations of the massless @xcite and massive @xcite vector schwinger model gave the expected value for the anomalously generated thooft vertex @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the index of the dirac operator was calculated in su(2 ) pure gauge theory slightly above the zero temperature crossover region @xcite .",
    "the index agreed within one sigma with the topological charge as calculated in @xcite indicating that the index theorem holds in a statistical sense .",
    "similar studies were done in @xcite for pure su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "the above mentioned body of work indicates that the overlap ( @xmath21 limit of domain wall fermions ) successfully incorporates exact zero modes at finite and relatively large lattice spacings .",
    "this suggests that with domain wall fermions , lattice qcd describes anomalous effects with regularization artifacts under firm control .",
    "unfortunately , a direct implementation of the overlap formalism in qcd needs computing resources that are beyond the capabilities of present day supercomputers .",
    "while a new proposal for reducing the computational cost of the overlap has been made @xcite , @xcite , it is not yet clear what the qcd computing requirement of this method will be . on the other hand",
    ", a straight - forward approach is to keep @xmath9 finite .",
    "this method was used in @xcite to simulate the dynamical two flavor schwinger model . in that work",
    "a detailed analysis of the @xmath9 dependence indicated that for the massive theory the @xmath22 value of the chiral condensate and of the thooft vertex was already reproduced within a few percent at @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the rate of approach was consistent with exponential decay with a decay rate that became faster as the continuum limit was approached . also , for an application to quenched qcd see @xcite .",
    "these promising results indicate the important possibility of practical , chirally - consistent qcd simulations with domain wall fermions at finite @xmath9 . in preparation for such simulations",
    "we wish to investigate to what extent the zero mode properties of the @xmath24 theory are maintained at numerically accessible values of @xmath9 ( @xmath25 ) . if a much larger @xmath9 is needed then one would not be able to exploit these important features . on the other hand ,",
    "if these properties are maintained at accessible values of @xmath9 then anomalous effects can be studied with firm control over the finite @xmath9 artifacts .    here",
    "we investigate this question using a classical instanton - like background @xcite with prescribed winding of one unit .",
    "this is a compactified , singular - gauge instanton with origin in the center of a unit hypercube .",
    "the instanton field is cut off smoothly at some radius @xmath26 so that it is entirely contained within the lattice volume .",
    "specifically , we begin with : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gauge field potential , @xmath29 is the space - time coordinate , @xmath30 is the magnitude of @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the first three gell - mann matrices , @xmath33 is as in @xcite , @xmath34 is the usual heavyside function and @xmath35 is the instanton radius . outside the fixed radius",
    "@xmath26 the configuration is strictly a gauge transformation .",
    "this continuum field is then transcribed in the standard way to a lattice configuration of group elements , @xmath36 , defined on the lattice links @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the lattice equivalent of the continuum transformation to singular gauge is applied : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the identity matrix and @xmath40 is a unit vector along the direction @xmath41 . provided that the instanton center is not on a lattice site , this transformation is well defined everywhere .",
    "after the transformation , all links lying entirely outside @xmath26 are equal to the unit matrix so the configuration exactly obeys the usual periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this instanton field is implemented on an @xmath42 lattice with @xmath43 and on a @xmath44 lattice with @xmath45 .",
    "thus , upon moving from the smaller to the larger lattice , we have reduced the lattice spacing , measured in units of the instanton radius , by nearly a factor of two . in order to study the robustness of zero modes ,",
    "random fluctuations with a given amplitude @xmath46 are superimposed . in particular , at each link a different su(3 ) matrix is constructed by exponentiating a linear combination of gell - mann matrices with random coefficients in the range @xmath47 $ ] . the gauge field at each link is then multiplied by these matrices .",
    "the operator used to study the effects of the winding of the gauge field background on the fermion sector is the chiral condensate @xmath48 calculated on that background .",
    "for staggered fermions @xmath49 $ ] where @xmath4 is the standard staggered dirac operator and @xmath50 is the four - dimensional volume . for domain wall fermions",
    "@xmath51 $ ] where @xmath4 is the five - dimensional dirac operator of @xcite , @xmath52 is its inverse with the fifth dimension indices fixed so that it corresponds to a propagator between four - dimensional quark fields that are projections of the 5-dimensional fields as prescribed in @xcite , and v is the four - dimensional volume . in particular , a four - dimensional dirac spinor field is formed by combining the two upper spin components of the five - dimensional dirac spinor field at @xmath7 with the lower two spin components at @xmath8 .",
    "this dirac operator contains an explicit mass term that mixes the right and left chiralities with strength @xmath53 .",
    "antiperiodic boundary conditions along the time direction were implemented for both staggered and domain wall fermions .",
    "the inversion was done using the conjugate gradient algorithm .",
    "the stopping condition ( ratio of the residual over the norm of the source ) was set to : @xmath54 for masses in the range @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 for masses in the range @xmath57 $ ] , @xmath58 for masses in the range @xmath59 $ ] , and @xmath60 for masses in the range @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "the trace is over space - time , spin and color .",
    "a stochastic estimator was used to calculate the trace . to get reasonable estimates of the average and error",
    "one would have to use a large number ( @xmath62 ) of gaussian random vectors .",
    "however , in this paper the interest is not so much in the actual value of the trace since it is only used as a device in studying the smallest eigenvalue ( topological zero mode ) of the domain wall fermion dirac operator . to the extent that the dirac propagator which enters @xmath48 is dominated by this single eigenvector of interest",
    ", the complete trace might be replaced by a single diagonal element taken in a random direction .",
    "this would give the desired trace , multiplied by the overlap between the random vector and the dominant zero mode .",
    "if the same random vector is used for all values of @xmath63 , @xmath53 and @xmath9 , it is expected that this overlap will be essentially constant and the variations seen will be those present in the full trace[6 ] .",
    "this strategy is followed in the calculation .",
    "however , in order to reduce the chance that the contribution of the single eigenvector of interest is accidentally suppressed by an unfortunate choice of random diagonal element , the same set of ten gaussian random vectors is used to approximate the trace for all values of @xmath63 , @xmath53 and @xmath9 .",
    "the error bars shown in the figures represent the fluctuations seen among these ten random vectors .",
    "given this small number of samples , it is not certain that these error estimates are accurate .",
    "however , additional calculation suggests that this particular sample probably underestimates the errors by less than a factor of two .    at infinite @xmath9 the explicit overlap formula for this formulation",
    "was derived in @xcite . using that it can be shown that @xmath48 diverges as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the index of the dirac operator as defined by the overlap formalism . at finite @xmath9",
    "the two chiralities do not completely decouple and therefore there is a residual mass .",
    "in free field theory this mass decreases exponentially with @xmath9 and the effective quark mass is proportional to the sum of the residual mass and the explicit mass @xmath53 .",
    "in particular @xcite : @xmath66 \\label{mass}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the mass ( domain wall height ) of the five dimensional theory . in free field theory one flavor physics",
    "is obtained for @xmath63 in the interval @xmath67 @xcite . in the interacting theory",
    "the boundaries of this interval will be renormalized . assuming a similar modification of the effective quark mass for the case of the instanton - like background one would expect that at finite @xmath9 , @xmath48 would behave as @xmath68 $ ] , where @xmath69 is a `` renormalized '' domain wall height .    as mentioned above , the index of the dirac operator in the overlap formalism is naturally integer valued .",
    "a method to measure this index was developed in @xcite and used in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the index is half the difference of the number @xmath70 of positive minus the number @xmath71 of negative eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath15 associated with the transfer matrix @xmath13 .",
    "this number is the same as half the difference of the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of the operator @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the standard wilson dirac operator evaluated at a mass which is the negative of the domain wall height , _",
    "@xmath74 @xcite @xcite . for",
    "@xmath75 it can be shown that @xmath76 for any background gauge field .",
    "therefore , by monitoring a few of the small positive and negative eigenvalues of @xmath77 as @xmath63 is varied between zero and the positive value of interest , one can determine the number of positive eigenvalues that crossed zero and became negative and the number of negative eigenvalues that crossed zero and became positive .",
    "the difference of the number of the two types of crossings is the index .    for the classical backgrounds that we studied we found that on the @xmath42 lattice the index changed from zero to one at @xmath78 and back from one to zero at @xmath79 . for the @xmath44 lattice the index changed at @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "( note this approach to the free - field values of 0 and 2 is expected as one goes to the smaller lattice spacing implied by our @xmath44 instanton - like configuration . )",
    "these values change by less than @xmath82 when noise was added .",
    "therefore , in these intervals one expects @xmath48 to diverge as @xmath83 is made small . at the crossing points the transfer matrix has a unit eigenvalue and even at @xmath84 the two chiralities",
    "do not decouple @xcite .",
    "therefore , near a crossing larger values of @xmath9 may be needed to see the expected @xmath85 behavior @xcite .    a `` sketch '' of the expected behavior of @xmath48 versus @xmath53 in the presence of a gauge field background with net winding",
    "is presented in figure @xmath86 . in order to facilitate the comparison with staggered fermions , we will also use @xmath53 for the usual staggered fermion mass .",
    "it is useful to analyze the mass dependence of @xmath48 by reference to the functional form of the spectral formula @xmath87",
    "\\sum_\\lambda \\{1 / ( \\lambda^2 + m^2)\\}. \\label{spectral - form}\\ ] ] this continuum equation is exact for the case of staggered fermions and offers a useful framework for discussion of domain wall fermions .",
    "we can distinguish four distinct regions suggested by this functional form . in the large @xmath53 region ( i )",
    ", we expect the propagator to be dominated by the mass term and therefore @xmath88 .",
    "this behavior is expected and seen for both domain wall and staggered fermions .",
    "next , we define region ( iii ) for staggered fermions , as the mass range within which @xmath53 is small but larger than the smallest eigenvalue @xmath89 . here ,",
    "@xmath89 is presumably shifted away from zero by finite lattice spacing effects . for staggered fermions",
    "@xmath89 is four - fold degenerate or near degenerate for the case where noise has been added .",
    "region ( iii ) is defined similarly for domain wall fermions , except the condition @xmath90 is replaced by @xmath91 , the residual mass due to the mixing of chiralities between the walls .",
    "( for the free field case , this is the @xmath92 term in equation [ mass ] . )",
    "although , domain wall fermions in the @xmath93 limit have @xmath94 its effects at finite @xmath9 are cut off by this residual mass .",
    "thus , for both staggered and domain wall fermions , one expects the small eigenvalue mode(s ) to dominate the value of @xmath48 in region ( iii ) and therefore @xmath95 where @xmath50 is the lattice volume .",
    "region ( ii ) is the crossover region between region ( i ) and region ( iii ) . in much of this region",
    "the mass is much larger than @xmath89 but is small enough to be relatively unimportant when compared with the rest of the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "therefore , referring to equation @xmath96 , one would expect @xmath97 in much of region ( ii ) .",
    "the expected behavior in region ( iv ) is different for staggered and domain wall fermions . for staggered fermions ( solid line ) @xmath89 is small but not zero .",
    "thus , in region ( iv ) , where @xmath98 , the effects of the factor of @xmath53 in the numerator of eq .",
    "[ spectral - form ] will dominate and therefore one would expect @xmath97 .",
    "in contrast , for domain wall fermions ( dashed line ) and @xmath99 , we expect @xmath100 to play the role of @xmath101 in eq .",
    "[ spectral - form ] so that in region ( iv ) @xmath102 for domain wall fermions , region ( iv ) is dominated by the finite @xmath9 , residual mixing of the two four - dimensional boundaries ( see eq .",
    "[ mass ] ) . in the numerical results of this paper region ( i ) and",
    "part of region ( ii ) are not present because the largest mass is @xmath103 .",
    "the focus is on region ( iii ) where the divergent @xmath104 behavior is expected and on the beginning of region ( iv ) whose onset signals the need for larger values of @xmath9 .",
    "the numerical results are presented in figures @xmath105 . in figure",
    "@xmath106 the staggered @xmath48 is plotted versus the quark mass @xmath53 in the presence of the compactified , singular - gauge instanton background .",
    "two lattice volumes and three different noise amplitudes , @xmath107 , are shown .",
    "for the case of the @xmath42 lattice with no noise , one may be able to recognize divergent , @xmath104 behavior in @xmath48 for @xmath108 indicating the presence of a near - zero mode .",
    "this divergent behavior does not extend to smaller @xmath53 presumably because of the zero mode shift effect @xcite .",
    "as can be seen when the lattice size is increased from @xmath42 to @xmath44 the instanton field becomes `` smoother '' ( lattice spacing is reduced by a factor of two ) and the divergent behavior becomes more pronounced now extending to the region @xmath109 . for a detailed analysis the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite . however , when noise is added the divergent behavior begins to disappear . at noise amplitudes of @xmath110",
    "the divergent behavior is not present in the @xmath42 lattice while in the @xmath44 lattice it has been significantly reduced .",
    "figure @xmath111 is the same as figure @xmath106 but now for the domain wall fermion @xmath48 with @xmath112 .",
    "results are shown for the two volumes @xmath42 and @xmath44 and for @xmath113 . as can be seen , @xmath88 for small @xmath53 .",
    "as expected , when @xmath53 becomes smaller than some value , the residual mixing between the two chiralities becomes the dominant contribution to @xmath83 and @xmath48 stops changing .",
    "this value is the border between regions ( iv ) and ( iii ) sketched in figure 1 . for the @xmath44 lattice and for",
    "@xmath114 one finds that @xmath88 for @xmath53 as small as @xmath115 . for @xmath116",
    "there is no signal of a divergence because the effective quark mass is dominated by the finite @xmath9 residual mass . for the @xmath42 lattice similar behavior",

    "the behavior remains unaffected for all practical purposes indicating robustness under high frequency noise .",
    "for @xmath122 the zero modes disappear ( not shown here ) but this level of noise is so large that it presumably destroys the winding . in particular , the index of the dirac operator , as defined by the overlap formalism , was found to be zero .    in figure",

    "the vertical lines indicate the values of @xmath63 where @xmath134 has a crossing .",
    "one can see that near the crossing points larger values of @xmath9 are required before @xmath48 becomes independent of @xmath9 .",

    "this means that no fine tuning of @xmath63 is needed even when large amounts of ultraviolet noise are added .",
    "the shape of the curves can be attributed to the wave function normalization factor which is a function of @xmath63 . in the free theory",

    "the zero mode effects are maintained and are robust under high frequency noise but larger @xmath9 is needed before @xmath48 becomes independent of @xmath9 . for the @xmath44 lattice @xmath48 becomes independent of @xmath9 for @xmath142 , but for the @xmath42 lattice this does not happen until @xmath141 .",
    "this is expected since the crossing point for the @xmath42 lattice is closer to @xmath138 than the crossing point for the @xmath44 lattice .",
    "if @xmath63 is allowed to get close to the crossing point one would expect that in order to maintain the zero mode effects much larger values of @xmath9 may be needed .",

    "in conclusion , for a classical , instanton - like background the domain wall fermion chiral condensate diverges as @xmath170 for @xmath53 as small as @xmath54 and @xmath9 as small as @xmath171 lattice spacings .",
    "this behavior was observed on lattices of size @xmath42 and @xmath44 and was robust under random , high frequency noise with amplitudes as large as @xmath121 .",
