    "the last decade has seen the rise of a wide variety of applications of strong lensing such as the study of distant lensed galaxies with unprecedented magnification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although strong lensing is a rare event , several surveys covering a wide sky area and deep enough imaging across different wavelengths , have resulted in the discovery of over 200 strong lens systems at galaxy scales from surveys such as , the great observatories origins deep survey @xcite , cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mediu deep survey @xcite the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and about a few dozen lens systems at cluster scales such as , the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the massive cluster survey ( macs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the las campanas distant cluster survey ( lcdcs , * ? ? ? * ) and the red sequence cluster survey ( rcs , * ? ? ? * henceforth g03 ) .",
    "large imaging and spectroscopic surveys enable us to probe statistical properties of both dark matter and baryonic matter or constrain cosmological parameters with high accuracy .",
    "for instance , on galaxy scales , the slacs sample has been used to study the average density profiles of lens galaxies up to redshift of @xmath20.3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , @xcite used the cfa - arizona space telescope lens survey ( castles , * ? ? ? * ) sample to measure the mean extinction due to the interstellar medium of the lens galaxies , @xcite estimated the fraction of mass in compact objects within lens galaxies from the castles , @xcite constrained the bright end of the quasar luminosity function from the absence of lensed quasars at high redshift in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . on cluster scales",
    ", g03 found the observed abundance of giant arcs from the rcs is too high to be consistent with the predictions from the current standard cosmological model ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xcite found some discrepancy between the predictions from the standard model and the observed distribution of einstein radii from the macs sample .",
    "however , the magnitude of these differences has been mitigated with subsequent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed above , the majority of the surveys in the past have primarily focused on studying galaxy - scale or cluster - scale structures . as a result ,",
    "matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters is relatively well - studied via both strong and weak lensing .",
    "a further improvement in our understanding has come from the use of complementary methods to lensing such as stellar kinematics , satellite kinematics and x - ray scaling relations .",
    "in contrast , little is known about galaxy groups which are intermediate to galaxies and galaxy clusters , typically corresponding to masses of @xmath5 .",
    "relatively fewer investigations have been carried out with galaxy groups e.g. , study of intra - group medium with very low redshift x - ray sample @xcite , study of mass - to - light ratios with the canadian network for observational cosmology 2 sample @xcite , study of faint end of the luminosity function of nearby compact groups @xcite , study of concentration - mass ( @xmath6-@xmath7 ) relation from the sdss @xcite via weak lensing , study of colors and star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , study of scaling relations of x - ray selected groups @xcite and study of baryon fractions from the 2mass @xcite . since studies of groups are limited and we still do not have a detailed understanding of matter distribution , formation and evolution of galaxy groups .",
    "being one of the important components in the hierarchical assembly of structures in the universe , galaxy groups are much more massive than galaxy - scale halos and are concentrated enough to act as lenses .",
    "furthermore , since galaxy groups are quite abundant compared to massive structures like galaxy clusters , the probability to find group scale lenses is also large .",
    "hence , lensing can be successfully used to study group - scale halos .",
    "the strong lensing legacy survey ( sl2s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a survey from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) .",
    "the design of the cfhtls allows us to find large sample of group - scale lenses , which can be studied in detail upto high redshifts , for the first time .",
    "the sl2s is as a precursor to wide field imaging surveys such as the dark energy survey , large synoptic survey telescope and euclid .",
    "a combined study of sl2s galaxy - scale lenses with the slacs sample have been used to show mild evolution of the slope of the average density profile of galaxies @xcite which is constrained by the strong lensing and stellar dynamics techniques .",
    "disk galaxies are also a relatively less studied population especially at high redshifts .",
    "an automated search for edge - on disk lenses from the sl2s resulted in 18 candidates , out of which 3 - 5 are expected to be real lenses @xcite .",
    "a subset of the sl2s groups have been studied in detail using a combination of techniques such as strong lensing , group dynamics , weak lensing to probe the density profiles of the lensing groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , we present the sl2s - arcs sample from the final t0006 release of the cfhtls . in section 2",
    ", we give an overview of the survey and procedure of sample selection , describe details of the algorithm , arcfinder @xcite and present the final sample . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss some statistical results using the final sample . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize the survey and our main findings .",
    "in this section , we give a brief overview of the survey from which we derive the lens sample .",
    "this is followed by a description of the semi - automatic process of selecting the candidates in the final sample .",
    "we also discuss how the algorithm , arcfinder works and the modifications implemented in the new arcfinder .",
    "lastly , we present the final sample and report duplicate detections of some candidates from other surveys .",
    "cfhtls is a photometric survey made with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) in five optical bands ( @xmath8 ) using the wide - field imager megaprime with a field - of - view of 1  deg@xmath0 on the sky and a pixel size of 0.186 .",
    "the wide and deep components of the cfhtls are designed to carry out extragalactic research .",
    "these components are ideal for searching strong lens systems .",
    "the sl2s sample is compiled from the cfhtls - wide encompassing a combined area of 171  deg@xmath0 and cfhtls - deep encompassing a combined area of 4  deg@xmath0 . however , taking into account the masked and overlapping areas , the effective area of the survey is 150.4  deg@xmath0 ( 146.9  deg@xmath0 for wide and 3.5  deg@xmath0 for deep ) .",
    "the wide consists of four fields w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 . the field w1 has the largest sky coverage of 63.65  deg@xmath0 . the fields w2 and w4 have similar sky coverages of 20.32  deg@xmath0 and 20.02  deg@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the field w3 has a sky coverage of 42.87  deg@xmath0 and is more than twice as large as w2 and w4 .",
    "the deep also consists of four fields d1 ( located within the w1 field ) , d2 , d3 and d4 .",
    "each of the deep fields covers an area of 1  deg@xmath0 .",
    "the deep images are produced in two image stacks d-25 and d-85 .",
    "the former consists of 25% of the best seeing images and the latter consists of 85% of best seeing images .",
    "we use the d-25 images for searching lens candidates . among the wide fields ,",
    "@xmath9 band imaging is the deepest of all bands with a limiting magnitude of 25.47 and a mean seeing of 0.78  whereas the @xmath9 band imaging of deep fields has nearly 10 times deeper exposures than the wide fields and the median seeing is @xmath10 .",
    "the zero point to convert flux to ab magnitude for all bands is 30 .",
    "further details of the t0006 release , which is the first complete release of the wide and deep , can be found on terapix website .",
    "the sl2s lens sample is compiled using two algorithms : ringfinder and arcfinder .",
    "the former aims at detecting galaxy - scale lenses by using color information .",
    "the sl2s rings sample will be presented and discussed in a separate paper ( gavazzi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . here",
    ", we focus on the sl2s - arcs ( sarcs ) sample created with the help of arcfinder , followed by visual inspection and screening of the candidates .",
    "we define the sarcs sample such that lens systems with arc radius ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 belong to the sample .",
    "the radius of the arc is defined as the distance of the lensed image from the putative lens galaxy which is roughly the einstein radius . typically , lensing halos with einstein radius larger than 2are very massive lenses with significant contribution from the environment of the primary lensing galaxy .",
    "thus , the sarcs sample , predominantly , consists of group to cluster scale lenses .",
    "lens systems with @xmath13 , typically , form part of the rings sample .",
    "we note that a few lens systems are common to both sl2s samples since the cut on @xmath11 is not a sharp limit imposed by the algorithms .",
    "the sarcs sample from the cfhtls is compiled in a three - step process .",
    "the first step is to run the arc - detection algorithm called arcfinder .",
    "we choose to run the arcfinder on the @xmath9-band image since most of the lensed images correspond to galaxies with high star formation that have little emission at redder wavelengths . also , focusing on g - band prevents from detecting high redshift g - dropouts .",
    "however , we plan to search for g - dropout arcs which are brighter in the @xmath14 band .",
    "these results will be presented in a separate paper .    at the end of the first step ,",
    "we produce a list of arc candidates with various parameters .",
    "the next step is applying a cut - off on arc properties such as the area , the peak flux count , the radius of curvature and reject candidates within masked area .",
    "these cuts allow a significant reduction in false detections at the cost of losing some real arc candidates . in the third step , visual inspection and classification",
    "are carried out to grade the quality of the candidates .",
    "note that the final sarcs sample consists of candidates that are detected by the arcfinder and/or by visual inspection",
    ".      with the advent of several large imaging surveys , searching for lens systems visually is a subjective and time expensive exercise which may not be easily repeatable .",
    "hence , several algorithms have been devised in the last few years to automate the process of lens detection as much as possible .",
    "the algorithms , usually , focus on a specific target population , for example , algorithms to detect the lensed sources such as quasars via the quasar time variability @xcite based on the difference imaging technique of @xcite , spectrum - based algorithms such as the one used by @xcite to form the slacs sample following the technique of @xcite or lens - modelling robots that assesses the probability of a bright red galaxy being a lens @xcite .",
    "since groups to cluster scale lenses form arc - like lensed images , there are a few arc - finders in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that aim at detecting elongated arc - like images .",
    "the arcfinder @xcite is a generic algorithm that can be used to detect elongated and curved features in an image .",
    "the algorithm uses pixel intensities from a standard fits image to trace the structure of a feature .",
    "multiple thresholds are applied to the structural properties of the feature to select an arc candidate .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the details of the algorithm .",
    "below , we describe the algorithm along with some modifications implemented in the newer version ( v2.0 ) which is used to compile the sarcs sample .",
    "flowchart showing the arcfinder algorithm . ]",
    "we show a flowchart to illustrate the various steps involved in the algorithm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : algo ] ) and step through an example of a mock arc image ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stp ] ) .    *",
    "we run the arcfinder on images of 19354@xmath1519354 pixels which corresponds to a single megacam pointing . for such large images , the assumption of gaussian distribution for the noise holds well . assuming a gaussian distribution for the noise in the input image ( panel 1 of fig .",
    "[ fig : stp ] ) , the noise @xmath16 is calculated in the first step .",
    "most of the arcs are unresolved with the ground - based telescopes like cfht and are limited by the size of the point spread function ( psf ) . *",
    "convolving the image with a smoothing kernel , with a size of the order of the psf , can help damp the noise and enhance the detection of arcs .",
    "hence , the input image is smoothed with a mexican - hat filter in the next step ( panel 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig : stp ] ) .",
    "+ the mexican - hat band - pass filter with scale @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19  pixels and @xmath20 * now , we define a local estimator of elongation for every pixel in the smoothed image .",
    "this is calculated by using the flux from all pixels within a window centered on every pixel .",
    "the size of the window is chosen to be a few times the psf size .",
    "we consider a square window of side w centered on the pixel at ( x , y ) .",
    "using the second order moments of brightness distribution within the window , the local direction of the elongation of the feature is calculated .",
    "this direction is then used to align the feature along the x - axis to determine the local axis ratio , similar to a length - to - width ratio , within the window .",
    "the elongation estimator is defined as follows + @xmath21 + where @xmath22 is the integrated flux of the single central row of pixels and @xmath23 is the maximum of the integrated flux values calculated from single columns of pixels within the window . if @xmath22 and @xmath24 are above @xmath25 ( threshold 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : algo ] and table  [ tab : thresh ] ) , then the estimator @xmath26 is assigned to the pixel ( x , y ) at the center of the window else the pixel is assigned a value of 0 . likewise , the estimator is calculated for every pixel in the image ( see panel 3 of fig .  [",

    "the estimator is particularly suited for recovering pixels along the length of the arc . in order to connect the pixels along the width of the arc , we use the input and smoothed images ( panels 1 and 2 , respectively ) . using arcs with length @xmath32 pixels ,",
    "we apply surface brightness thresholds on pixel values from images in panels 1 and 2 in order to accept pixels belonging to the arc ( threshold 4 , see fig .",

    "[ fig : algo ] , then the arc is accepted ( see panel 5 in fig .  [",
    "fig : stp ] ) . * in the following , we describe how the arc properties are measured .",
    "the area of the arc is the total number of pixels belonging to the final arc .",
    "the length of the arc is calculated by assuming that the candidate arc is similar to an arc of a circle .",

    "the radius of the circle going through the arc is used as a proxy for the curvature of the arc .    in the algorithm ,",
    "the use of a second image at another wavelength and a mask file are optional .",
    "the algorithm , in its current version , merely prints the values of the pixels belonging to the candidate arc from the image 2 and/or the mask file , if provided .",
    "this allows us to optionally screen the candidate arcs based on their color and/or masking information . for the sarcs sample",
    ", we made use of the mask option only and further restricted the parameter space of the output list of arcs by introducing more strict cuts on some of the arc properties .",

    "the components enclosed by the dashed line in the fig .",
    "[ fig : algo ] are the sections of the algorithm that have been improved .",
    "this includes the way in which the pixels belonging to the arc are connected and the way the properties of the arcs are measured . in the earlier version of the algorithm , a candidate arc is accepted at the final stage only if it satisfies a certain threshold on the curvature of the arc .",
    "this feature has been removed and the option of using mask information is introduced in the v2.0 .",
    "the values for all the different thresholds are tuned from an initial sample of cfhtls arcs , found visually or from the previous version of arcfinder , based on an early release of the data .",
    "furthermore , all the thresholds can now be set during the execution of the algorithm .",
    "the arcfinder v2.0 finds @xmath42 more detections , most of which arise due to spikes and halos near stars .",
    "however , the use of masks removes these false detections thereby making the number of detections comparable or less than the output of the earlier version .",
    "the modified arcfinder is over 3 times faster than the earlier version .",
    "we have also recently parallelized the algorithm which enables us to achieve even faster computation on shared memory platforms .",
    "the arcfinder v2.0 is available upon request to the author .",
    "finally , we note that the existing algorithms are far from perfect and almost always require manual intervention .",
    "attempts to increase the completeness of the sample almost always leads to a corresponding increase in the rate of false positives . in light of these issues ,",
    "citizen science projects such as the galaxy zoo @xcite might be a better tool , for the time being , in identifying lens systems not detected by the algorithms .",
    "these projects , in turn , could be used to calibrate and improve existing algorithms .",
    "we are currently pursuing the feasibility of such a project .",
    "after the automatic detection and screening , about 1000 candidates / deg@xmath0 are visually inspected .",
    "this is reduced to a total sample of 413 candidates which is further considered for ranking by three people .",

    "the statistics of giant arcs allow detection of clusters at the massive end of halo mass function that are rare .",

    "we use the primary sample of rcs which has roughly similar depth compared to wide data .",
    "the primary rcs lens sample has 6 arcs with @xmath73 found within a total area of 90  deg@xmath0 g03 .",

    "they underlined the need of larger observational datasets to further explore effects of substructure , mass of the central galaxy and homogeneity of the sample .",

    "the nature of the radial arc candidates needs to be verified with spectroscopy and mass modeling since these could be blue edge - on disk galaxies .",
    "radial arcs are usually faint and are overshadowed by the bright central galaxies near which they are formed .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that a follow - up imaging of the promising sarcs candidates at high resolution will help in creating a homogeneous sample of radial and tangential arcs which could provide crucial insights in understanding the density distributions in the inner regions of the lens systems .      in this section ,",
    "we quantify the angular distribution of arcs with respect to the major axis of the ellipticity of the lensing halo .",
    "d04 suggested that triaxial dark matter halos , when acting as lenses , usually form lip caustics ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the formation of giant arcs tends to be at the ends of the lip caustics . using numerical simulations , they showed that the giant arcs are oriented very close to the major axis of the dark matter halo .",
    "if a central galaxy is further added to the halo , then it appeared to isotropize the angular distribution of arcs to a small extent . in order to compare these predictions to the observations , d04 measured the angular distribution of giant arcs from the emss cluster sample under the assumption that the ellipticity of the lensing galaxy is a good representation of the ellipticity of the underlying dm halo .",
    "they found that most of the giant arcs had an orientation of @xmath77  45  deg consistent with their predictions .",
    "we use the same definition as that used in d04 for the orientation of the arcs , that is , the angle between the major axis of the lens galaxy and the line connecting the center of the lens galaxy to the midpoint of the arc .",
    "the measurement of orientation of real arcs tends to be somewhat subjective since there exists an ambiguity in defining the extent of the arc which is required to find the midpoint of the arc .",
    "the midpoint of the arc and its orientation from the major axis of the lens is calculated manually . when there is a single dominant lensing galaxy we measure the position angle ( pa ) of the major axis of the lens galaxy with sextractor @xcite otherwise we adopt the following strategy .",
    "if there are two or three ( nearly collinear ) lens galaxies with similar colors and brightness , then the pa of the ellipticity is assumed to be along the line joining the lens galaxies .",
    "if a circle going through the arc encloses multiple lens galaxies with comparable brightness but no obvious elongation , then such system is rejected . if one of the lens galaxies is predominantly brighter than the companion galaxies , then the ellipticity of the dominant galaxy is assumed to reflect the overall ellipticity of the gravitational potential and hence , of the caustics .        after applying the above selection cuts , we are left with 36 all arc candidates and 11 giant arcs with an average ranking @xmath78 .",
    "the angular distribution of the giant arcs from the sarcs sample is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : orien ] .",
    "we compare the observed distribution to the expected distributions from d04 which correspond to two cases : a ) for dark matter only lensing halo ( solid curve ) and b ) a dark matter halo to which a galaxy of @xmath79 is added ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the distribution of giant arcs from our sample appears to follow the expected trend although it is not possible to distinguish between the two cases .",
    "we also show the distribution of orientation of all arc candidates ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : orien ] ) which seems to follow the expected anisotropy .",
    "this extends the result obtained by d04 to groups - scale lens systems .",
    "furthermore , we split the all arcs sample into a small @xmath11 ( @xmath80 ) and large @xmath11 ( @xmath81 ) samples to see the dependence of the angular distribution on the einstein radius ( or the arc radius ) .",
    "the choice of cut at 5is arbitrary .",
    "the baryonic matter tends to make the matter distribution in halos more spherical at the center .",
    "therefore , the angular distribution of arcs for the sample with smaller @xmath11 is expected to be more isotropic compared to the sample with large @xmath11 .",
    "however , we do not find any clear differences in the angular distribution of small and large @xmath11 for the sarcs sample within the uncertainties ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : orien ] ) .",
    "we note that these measurements may have some systematic errors due to the orientation dependence of the selection function .",
    "ambiguities also exist in the definition of the orientation in few cases , especially when multiple candidate lens galaxies are involved .",
    "in addition , the current analysis consists of lens candidates as opposed to confirmed lens systems .",
    "therefore , our conclusions should be treated more of a qualitative nature .",
    "the image separation distribution ( isd ) is sensitive to the halo mass , abundance of the lens population , the mass distribution in the lens and the source redshift .",
    "therefore , the isd measured from galaxy to cluster scales contains information about the cosmological parameters and various scaling relations between galaxy properties and halo mass .",
    "hitherto , the isd has been measured either at small image separations ( @xmath82 ) primarily , with lens samples such as castles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and class ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or at large @xmath82 with cluster - scale lenses , for example , the macs sample @xcite . with the sarcs sample ,",
    "we can probe the intermediate mass regime corresponding to group scale lenses .",
    "the sarcs sample is selected based on the presence of elongated arc - like features and is not directly biased towards selecting a specific lens population .",
    "the isd measured from the lens samples is referred to as the observed isd and the isd calculated from various models is referred to as the expected / predicted isd throughout this paper .      in the past ,",
    "the expected isd was computed with models consisting of either galaxy dominated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or dark matter dominated lensing halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , since the density profile of dark matter is known to be affected due to the presence of baryons at the center , the need for a more complex model to explain the observed isd was pointed out by @xcite and demonstrated by subsequent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is clear from the fig .",
    "[ fig : isdog ] that the sarcs sample follows a steeper isd at the intermediate scales compared to halos with nfw profile and shallower than halos with only sis profile .",
    "it is interesting to compare the sarcs sample with the slacs and macs samples which span the lower end and higher end of the isd , respectively .",

    "as expected , the macs sample is nearly consistent with either the nfw or total profile . assuming that incompleteness is the only major factor in the isd of slacs , the expected isd corresponding to the total profile best matches the slacs , sarcs and macs samples combined .",
    "we note that we have not accounted for any effects due to purity or incompleteness of the sarcs sample in this paper .",
    "we suspect that the completeness of the sample as a function of the image separation is not severely affected due to the selection function .",

    "prima facie , the ac model fits the data better than the model without ac .",
    "however , as we show below , there are other degeneracies in the model which prevent us from ruling out the  no ac \" model at high significance .",

    "the @xmath7-@xmath95 relation of y08 differ by @xmath20.2  dex from that of @xcite at the intermediate mass regime which is the regime of interest .",
    "this appears to cause a very negligible change in the predicted isd .",
    "we try to quantify the effect of varying the slope of the source luminosity function at the faint - end .",
    "we show the effect on the combined profile of o06 and vary the power law index , @xmath132 of the source luminosity function , @xmath133 .",
    "this influences the lens cross - section via the magnification bias .",
    "the solid curve in fig .  [ fig : isdts ] shows the expected isd using the fiducial value of @xmath134 , while the dotted and short dashed curves show the isd in the right panel , corresponding to @xmath132 equal to -1.7 and -1.2 , respectively .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the observed isd can be used to constrain the slope of the luminosity function , if the statistical error bars could be reduced .",
    "we note that the magnification bias factor in the biased lens cross - section is calculated assuming that the background sources are point sources such as quasars .",
    "however , the background sources corresponding to the lensed arcs are mostly galaxies with extended surface brightness and their magnification bias could be negligible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : isdts ] shows the isd without the bias .",
    "the data is consistent with all of the above tested models within the uncertainties .",
    "the various scaling relations from our model , that are tested here , have degenerate effects on the expected isd .",
    "for example , varying the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation has the same effect as changing the slope of the luminosity function or excluding ac . however , constraints from independent observations such as dynamics and strong lensing could be used to determine the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation .",
    "this will allow us to better constrain the slope of the luminosity function or make more robust statements about ac .",
    "for all the theoretical calculations , we have assumed @xmath136 for the source redshift .",
    "we checked the effect of adopting different source redshifts , @xmath137 and @xmath138 on the predicted isd .",
    "we found that using a higher ( lower ) source redshift causes the predicted @xmath139 to be larger ( smaller ) by roughly a constant factor at all values of @xmath82 .",
    "however , the predicted @xmath140 is not affected because the corresponding increase ( decrease ) in @xmath108 almost perfectly cancels out the increase ( decrease ) in @xmath139 .",
    "this implies that the expected isd would not be drastically different had we accounted for the distribution of source redshifts instead of assuming a single value for the source redshift .",
    "we have presented the sarcs sample from the completed cfhtls - wide and cfhtls - deep covering a combined unmasked area of @xmath2150  deg@xmath0 in the sky .",
    "the lens sample is compiled through a semi - automatic technique consisting of using arcfinder algorithm , followed by visual inspection and ranking of the candidates .",
    "we briefly described the working of the arcfinder @xcite and the modifications implemented in the newer version of the algorithm .",
    "although the arcfinder v2.0 is faster , there is still scope for improving the algorithm in terms of increasing the purity without compromising the completeness of the arc detections .",
    "we have compiled a total of 127 candidates in the sarcs sample , out of which 38 are found serendipitously . from the complete sample , 54 are promising lens systems ( ranking of 3 and above ) .",
    "a total of 31 systems are almost certain or confirmed systems , out of which 27 systems have been followed - up via techniques such as spectroscopy , high - resolution imaging and/or lens mass modeling .",
    "we found 2 radial arc candidates in the sarcs sample and both of them are located in the system sa100 .",
    "the second radial arc is clearly identified from the high resolution _ hst _  imaging only .",
    "our sample may have more radial arcs which could be discovered with high resolution imaging . with statistics of radial and tangential arcs from a homogeneous and a larger sample of lenses , interesting constraints",
    "could be placed on the slope of inner density profiles of the dark matter distribution .",
    "we have discovered a total of 12 giant arcs ( @xmath73 ) in our sample .",
    "statistics with giant arcs is considered to be a good probe of cluster properties or cosmological parameters but not an easy one .",
    "we have presented the redshift distributions of the lens galaxies with giant arcs and all arcs in the sarcs sample using the photometric redshifts and found to have mean values at @xmath4 .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the expected peak at redshift of @xmath141 @xcite but consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "note that the predictions need to be revised with improved simulations and more realistic assumptions .",
    "we also calculated the angular distribution of giant arcs which are sensitive to the ellipticity of the halo .",
    "we found an anisotropy in the orientation of arcs in our sample consistent with that seen in simulated lens clusters ( e.g. see d04 ) .",
    "in addition , the angular distribution of all arcs from the sarcs sample exhibits similar anisotropy . this anisotropy appears to hold at all arc radii within the current uncertainties albeit needs to be verified with a sample of confirmed lenses .",
    "thus , we have extended this result to group scale halos , observationally .",
    "it would be interesting to check if lensed arcs in simulated group scale halos also show a similar anisotropy in their azimuthal distribution and what constraints could be placed on the baryonic physics important in the inner few kpcs which is probed by these lensed arcs .",
    "we followed the formalism of o06 to calculate the expected isd in order to compare it with the observed isd from sarcs sample .",
    "we first reproduced the results of o06 and then introduced variations in different scaling relations used in their model .",
    "the sarcs sample allowed , for the first time , to probe the intermediate mass regime corresponding to group - scale halos via the isd .",
    "we showed that the density profile of the halos are well - reproduced by a combined profile ( nfw and hernquist ) at the group - scales , which is consistent with the predictions .",
    "given the uncertainties in the data and the degeneracies in the model , both the models that account for or exclude the role of ac are consistent with the observed isd .",
    "with the availability of larger statistics of confirmed lenses and understanding of the sample selection function , the distinction between models with and without ac would be possible .",
    "next , we varied the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation , the halo mass - luminosity relation , the slope of a power - law source luminosity function and the source redshift .",
    "we found that given the current uncertainties in the observed isd , the @xmath6-@xmath7 relations of both @xcite and the more recent , @xcite , are plausible .",
    "the expected isd does not vary significantly and fits the data well , if the halo mass - luminosity relations have an uncertainty of @xmath142  dex .",
    "following o06 , we adopted a power - law index of @xmath134 for the background source luminosity function to account for the magnification bias .",
    "we further tested the effect of varying the @xmath132 on the expected isd and found to be consistent with the data .",
    "however , within the uncertainties , the data is also consistent , if no magnification bias is assumed .",
    "we did not test the effects of any evolution of the luminosity function or any other functional form such as a broken power law .",
    "we found that varying the model parameters have degenerate effects on the isd , for instance , changing the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation and changing the slope of the luminosity function , @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , using priors from independent methods on one of these relations could help in constraining the others via the observed isd .",
    "since the background sources are assumed to be at a redshift of 2 , we tested the effect of varying the source redshift .",
    "the expected isd ( @xmath140 ) is not affected by choosing different redshifts ( z@xmath143 ) between the range we tested .    as described above , we have used arcs statistics to probe the average density profiles of group - scale lenses and we have shown the possibility to use arcs statistics in constraining some scaling relations .",
    "however , the models assumed in our work are simplistic and will need refinement as the lens samples become larger with upcoming surveys . on the observational side ,",
    "understanding the selection effects will also become crucial , if the model parameters need to be constrained with high accuracy .",
