    "thus the length of a vector is at most @xmath64    let us write , for any lattice @xmath12@xmath65 the maximum is over all sublattices of all ranks ( it is easily seen that the maximum is attained ) .",

    "we now continue the proof of the proposition . by our assumption ,",
    "the product of the eigenvalues of @xmath78 is at least 1 , and the lemma implies that they are real and positive . by the inequality between the geometric and arithmetic means , @xmath81 however , @xmath82 so @xmath83 as needed .",

    "we may assume that the angle between @xmath56 and @xmath89 is between @xmath91 and @xmath92 it follows that @xmath93 if either of @xmath56 or @xmath89 is indecomposable ( of length @xmath94 ) we are done , since its norm is then at least @xmath95 and the other s norm is at least 1 , but @xmath96 we may therefore assume that @xmath97 are both decomposable tensors .",
    "we now use the identity @xmath98 which follows at once from the fact that @xmath99 if @xmath100 and @xmath101 are proportional , then @xmath102 and @xmath103 are independent , and @xmath104 @xmath105 while the second and the third terms vanish .",
