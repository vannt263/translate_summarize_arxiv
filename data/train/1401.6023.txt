    "in network information theory , we study the fundamental limits of information flow and processing in a network and develop coding strategies that can approach the limits closely . instead of studying a fully general network , however , we often study simple canonical models such as the multiple - access channel @xcite , relay channel @xcite , and distributed source coding @xcite because they are easier to study and more importantly because we can get useful insights from studying them .",
    "once such insights are obtained , one can try to develop a more general theory that is applicable to general networks .",
    "however , such a task is challenging and only partial results have been known so far @xcite , in which network model and/or applied coding technique is limited .",
    "for example , network coding  @xcite and compress - and - forward ( cf )  @xcite were unified as noisy network coding in  @xcite , but does not include decode - and - forward ( df ) @xcite .",
    "df and partial df @xcite were generalized for single - source multiple - relay single - destination networks @xcite and for multicast and broadcast networks @xcite , respectively",
    ". in @xcite , noisy network coding was combined with network df @xcite , but does not allow a relay to perform both partial df and cf simultaneously . for joint source - channel coding problems , a hybrid analog / digital coding strategy @xcite was proposed that recovers and generalizes many previously known results .",
    "such a hybrid coding scheme was applied to some relay networks and was shown to unify both amplify - and - forward ( af ) @xcite and cf @xcite . in @xcite , a novel framework for proving achievability was proposed based on output statistics of random binning and source  channel duality .",
    "one important feature of this framework is that the addition of secrecy is free , i.e. , once an achievability result is obtained for a network model using this framework , an achievability result with additional secrecy constraint is immediately obtained .",
    "we note that @xcite and @xcite took a bottom - up approach in a sense that achievability results are separately obtained for each of various network models .    in this paper ,",
    "we take a top - down approach and prove a unified achievability theorem for a general network scenario with arbitrarily many nodes .",
    "our setup is general enough such that any combination of source coding , channel coding , joint source - channel coding , and coding for computing problems can be treated .",
    "our result recovers most of the exiting achievability results in network information theory as long as they are based on random coding .",
    "some examples of known results recovered by our theorem are listed as follows :    * channel coding : gelfand - pinsker coding  @xcite , marton s inner bound for the broadcast channel  @xcite , han - kobayashi inner bound for the interference channel  @xcite , @xcite , coding for channels with action - dependent states @xcite , interference decoding for a 3-user interference channel  @xcite , @xcite , cover - leung inner bound for the multiple access channel with feedback  @xcite , a combination of partial df and cf for the relay channel  @xcite , network df  @xcite , noisy network coding @xcite , short message noisy network coding with a df option  @xcite , offset encoding for the multiple access relay channel  @xcite . * source coding : slepian - wolf coding @xcite , wyner - ziv coding  @xcite , berger - tung inner bound for distributed lossy compression  @xcite , @xcite , zhang - berger inner bound for multiple description coding @xcite . * joint source - channel coding : hybrid coding  @xcite and all previous results recovered by hybrid coding including sending arbitrarily correlated sources over multiple access channels @xcite , broadcast channels @xcite , and interference channels @xcite . * coding for computing : coding for computing  @xcite , cascade coding for computing @xcite",
    ".          our theorem can be useful in proving new achievability results easily and in some cases gives simpler rate expressions than those obtained using conventional approaches .",
    "furthermore , our unified coding can strictly outperform existing schemes . to illustrate this , we show that a generalized decode - compress - amplify - and - forward bound for acyclic networks can be obtained as a simple corollary of our main theorem and show it strictly outperforms previously known coding schemes . as another special case of our main theorem",
    ", we derive a generalized decode - compress - and - forward bound for a discrete memoryless network ( dmn ) in  @xcite , which recovers both noisy network coding  @xcite and distributed decode - and - forward  @xcite bounds .",
    "this is the first time the partial - decode - compress - and - forward bound ( theorem 7 ) by cover and el gamal  @xcite is generalized for dmn s such that each relay performs both partial df and cf simultaneously .",
    "our unified coding theorem enables us to state various types of duality arising in network information theory .",
    "specifically , we formally define and characterize three types of network duality based on channel input - output reversal and network flow reversal combined with packing - covering duality .",
    "our duality results include as special cases many known duality relationships in network information theory , e.g. , the duality between coding for multiple - access channel @xcite and distributed sources @xcite , @xcite ( type - i duality ) , the duality between gelfand - pinsker coding @xcite and wyner - ziv coding @xcite ( type - ii duality ) , and the duality between coding for multiple - access channel @xcite and broadast channel @xcite ( type - iii duality ) .",
    "our unified achievability result is enabled by many novel elements such as a unified framework that represents various network problems in a simple and unified way , a unified coding strategy that consists of a few basic ingredients but can emulate known coding techniques if needed , and new proof techniques beyond the use of standard covering and packing lemmas . in our framework ,",
    "sources , channels , states and side information are treated in a unified way and various constraints such as cost and distortion constraints are combined as a joint - typicality constraint , which is specified by a single joint distribution .",
    "furthermore , we mainly consider acyclic discrete memoryless networks ( admn ) in this paper , where information flows in an acyclic manner .",
    "however , we also show our coding theorem can also be applied to general dmn s by unfolding the network .",
    "graph unfolding was first used in  @xcite for network coding .",
    "our coding scheme has four main ingredients , i.e. , superposition coding , simultaneous nonunique decoding , simultaneous compression , and symbol - by - symbol mapping .",
    "we note that our coding scheme does not explicitly include binning and multicoding , but is still general enough to emulate them if needed .",
    "although each of these coding ingredients is not new , these are tweaked and combined in a special way to enable unification of many previous approaches . in our coding scheme , covering codebooks are used to compress information that each node observes and decodes .",
    "these covering codebooks are generated to permit superposition coding @xcite .",
    "each node operates according to the following three steps .",
    "the first step is simultaneous nonunique decoding @xcite , where a node uniquely decodes some covering codewords of other nodes together with some other covering codewords that do not need to be decoded uniquely .",
    "the next step is simultaneous compression , where the node finds covering codewords simultaneously that carry information about a received channel output sequence and decoded codewords .",
    "since we allow general superposition relationship among covering codebooks , a more general analysis beyond multivariate covering lemma @xcite is needed .",
    "the last step is a symbol - by - symbol mapping from a received channel output sequence and decoded and covered codewords to a channel input sequence .",
    "the technique of using a symbol - by - symbol mapping was introduced in @xcite , which is referred to as the shannon strategy .",
    "our symbol - by - symbol mapping from all three , i.e. , the channel output sequence and decoded and covered codewords , was first used in @xcite for a three - node noncausal relay channel .",
    "we note that such a use of symbol - by - symbol mapping results in correlation between a channel input sequence and nonchosen covering codewords and thus the standard packing lemma @xcite can not be applied for the error analysis .",
    "such correlation was problematic in many previous works and solved for some simple networks in @xcite .",
    "our proof technique completely solves this correlation issue in a fully general network setup .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : framework ] , we present our unified framework . in section  [ sec : main ] , we propose a unified coding scheme and present the main theorem of this paper .",
    "we also show various examples to illustrate how to utilize our results . in section  [ sec : duality ] , we characterize three types of network duality . to demonstrate usefulness of our unified coding theorem , in section [ sec : gdcaf ] , we derive a generalized decode - compress - amplify - and - forward bound as a simple corollary of our theorem and show it strictly outperforms previously known coding schemes . in section  [ sec : gaussian ] , we present a unified coding theorem for the gaussian case .",
