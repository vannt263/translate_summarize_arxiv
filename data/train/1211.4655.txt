    "allan sandage ( 1926 - 2010 ) was one of the best observers ever , but his driver was always the physical understanding of astronomical phenomena .",
    "physics as his primary goal is exemplified in his ground - braking paper _ ` the ability of the 200-inch telescope to discriminate between selected world models ' _ @xcite that became the basis of modern observational cosmology . other examples",
    "are the emerging understanding of stellar evolution @xcite , the theory of stellar pulsation @xcite , the formation of the galaxy @xcite and of other galaxies @xcite , including their violent stages @xcite , the nature of the expansion field @xcite , and the age dating of stellar clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as of the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "he devoted several papers to the tolman test of the nature of redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and he is the father of what has become known as the sandage - loeb effect @xcite .",
    "walter baade , the thesis adviser of sandage , gave him a tough training in the ancient and intricate art of observing ; it was later described in sandage s outstanding history , _ ` the mount wilson observatory ' _ @xcite .",
    "soon sandage excelled himself in that high art and was commissioned to observe also for hubble .",
    "he loved to observe on mount wilson and palomar mountain .",
    "after the split of the carnegie institution and the california institute of technology in 1980 , he did not go to palomar again . on mount wilson he was one of the last observers before the mountain",
    "was given into other hands in the mid-1980s .",
    "a consolation became the wide - field @xmath5 m telescope of the las campanas observatory , where he took many direct plates for his atlases and for the extensive virgo cluster survey @xcite . in total",
    ", he has spent more than 2000 nights at various telescopes .",
    "he felt a strong responsibility to reduce and publish the enormous amount of accumulated observations .",
    "after 1990 he used only the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ ; it was abhijit saha who introduced him to the novel technique of ccd photometry .",
    "his thesis assignment was the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the globular cluster m3 . by pushing the photometry down to an unprecedented limit of @xmath6",
    ", he could find the cluster s main sequence and fit it to the main sequence of the young population  i ( fig.[fig:01 ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "this provided an essential clue to the theory of stellar evolution , but at the same time it solved a long - standing problem of the distance scale .",
    "@xcite had pointed out that galaxy distances derived from rr  lyrae stars and cepheids were in contradiction .",
    "it became now clear that the rr  lyrae calibration was roughly correct , whereas the cepheids were too faint by @xmath7 .",
    "this confirmed @xcite proposal that all of hubble s distances had to be doubled . in the following more than 50  years",
    "sandage published some 40 papers on the physics and luminosity of rr  lyrae stars and 50 papers on cepheids .",
    "the distance scale runs like a red line through his entire professional life .",
    "the next stretch came with the paper of @xcite , for which sandage had written the analytical part .",
    "he much improved hubble s galaxy magnitudes and showed that what hubble had identified as brightest stars in other galaxies were in fact hii regions .",
    "this led to h@xmath8 .",
    "two years later , he @xcite concluded from a re - discussion of the cepheid distances and from straightening out the confusion of hii regions and brightest stars that @xmath9 ; this was an increase of hubble s distance scale by a factor 5 to 10 .",
    "@xcite defended this range of h@xmath10 , also using the angular size of the largest hii regions and novae , against higher values proposed at the influential santa barbara conference on extragalactic research .",
    "determination of the extragalactic distance scale had been described by @xcite as one of the main goals of the forthcoming 200  inch telescope .",
    "correspondingly , baade and hubble had taken repeated photographs , once the telescope had gone into operation , of several galaxies for work on their cepheids ; they were joined by sandage in the following years .",
    "a parallel task was for sandage , w.  a. baum , and h.  c. arp to establish reliable photoelectric magnitude sequences in a number of fields .",
    "in the mid-1960s , there were sufficient data for sandage , who had inherited the photographic plates of baade and hubble , to start a new onslaught on h@xmath10 .",
    "it was preceded by a new period - luminosity (",
    "p - l ) relation for cepheids ( sandage & tammann @xcite ) , which was a superposition of the known cepheids in large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) , m31 , and ngc6822 , and whose zero point was based on five galactic cepheids that are members of open clusters with known distances ( see fig.[fig:02 ] ) .",
    "the moduli of the lmc and smc agree with modern values to within @xmath11 , the modulus of m31 , based on the excellent cepheids of @xcite , was still @xmath12 short , and the distance to ngc6822 was too long due to internal absorption .",
    "another prerequisite for the new determination of h@xmath10 was the first cepheid distance outside the local group , i.e.of the highly resolved galaxy ngc2403 @xcite , which was taken as representative for the whole m81 group .",
    "in the two first steps of the series @xcite , the linear size of the largest hii regions and the luminosity of the brightest blue and red stars were calibrated with the available cepheid distances . the maximum hii - region size and blue - star luminosity",
    "were found to increase with galaxy size , whereas the red - star luminosity is quite stable . in step",
    "iii , the results were applied to the m101 group which was found at a then surprisingly large distance of @xmath13 , yet in agreement with the modern value ( see section  [ sec:7 ] ) .",
    "step  iv served to extend and calibrate @xcite luminosity classes of spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "these morphological classes depend on the surface brightness and the ` beauty ' of the spiral structure .",
    "in particular , it was found that giant sc spirals ( sci ) have a mean intrinsic face - on luminosity of @xmath14 .",
    "the additional inclusion of fainter luminosity classes gave a virgo cluster modulus of @xmath15 , which , with an adopted cluster velocity of @xmath16 , led to a first hint of h@xmath17 .",
    "to extend the distance scale farther out , remote sci spirals were selected in the polar caps of the national geographic - palomar sky survey in step  vi . for 69 of these galaxies",
    ", spectra could be measured , resulting in velocities of @xmath18 .",
    "their apparent magnitudes , @xmath19 , were taken from the zwicky catalog @xcite and corrected for galactic and internal absorption .",
    "the sample out to @xmath20 is shown in the hubble diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] ; it is necessarily biased by the magnitude limit of the catalog .",
    "a subsample of 36 galaxies within @xmath21 was therefore isolated .",
    "it was ensured that is was not affected by the magnitude limit .",
    "this sample and the above luminosity calibration yields h@xmath22 with a statistical error of @xmath23 .",
    "the summary paper ( numbered as step  v ) gives h@xmath24 with a small statistical error for the global value and with a tacit understanding that the systematic error is on the order of 10% .",
    "mean _ expansion rate of the nearby galaxies was shown not to depend on the supergalactic longitude and also to be independent of distance , in agreement with an earlier conclusion of @xcite .",

    "the results of the ` steps toward the hubble constant ' met with stiff opposition from g.  de vaucouleurs for the following 10 years .",
    "he considered the expansion rate to be a stochastic variable , depending on distance and direction with a mean value of @xmath26 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the main reason for the disagreement is not that his very local galaxies were @xmath27 closer than adopted by sandage and than modern values , but that he did not distinguish between magnitude - limited and distance - limited samples .",
    "the distinction is decisive in cases where the distance indicator has non - negligible intrinsic scatter , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] .",
    "it shows a monte carlo distribution of 500 galaxies randomly distributed within 40mpc ; their absolute magnitude is @xmath28 , with an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath29 .",
    "as long as the sample is complete to the given distance limit , their mean luminosity does not change with distance .",
    "if the same galaxies are cataloged with a limiting magnitude of @xmath30 , then the less luminous galaxies are progressively excluded ; the rest of the sample has unfortunate statistical properties : the mean luminosity increases with distance , in the present sample by as much as @xmath29 and the apparent dispersion decreases with distance . the small dispersion at large distances has often led to the erroneous conclusion that the true scatter is small and that selection bias was negligible .",
    "selection bias is particularly dangerous for the tully - fisher ( t - f ) relation because of its large intrinsic scatter of @xmath31 .",
    "applications of the method to magnitude - limited samples that are not even complete has notoriously led to overestimated values of h@xmath10 .",
    "a hubble diagram of a _ distance - limited _ , almost complete sample of t - f distances , necessarily limited to @xmath32 , gives a local value of h@xmath33 ( see fig.[fig:05 ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "sandage has written a number of papers on various forms of selection bias and its compensation in favorable cases , including a series of 12 papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "during the planning phase for _ hst _ , sandage formed a small team , including a.  saha , f.  d.  macchetto , n.  panagia , and g.  a.  tammann , to determine the cepheid distances of some galaxies with known type ia supernovae ( sneia ) , which  with their maximum magnitudes taken as standard candles  should lead to a large - scale value of h@xmath10 . in spite of a pilot paper @xcite ,",
    "the small luminosity dispersion of sneia was not yet established in 1990 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:06 ] , left ) , but they were proven as exquisite standard candles in the following years .",
    "the sn _ hst _ project was complimentary to the _ hst _ key project for h@xmath10 that originally did not include sneia as targets .",
    "the maximum magnitude of sneia must be corrected for internal absorption and standardized to a fixed decline rate @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "different procedures have been proposed .",
    "we use here the @xmath35 magnitudes of @xcite because they define a hubble diagram with a particularly small scatter of @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:06 ] middle ) and yield a well - defined intercept of @xmath37 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the corrected magnitudes of other authors may not have the same zero point because of different choices of intrinsic colors , absorption laws , and reference values of @xmath34 .",
    "the intercept @xmath38 of the hubble line is defined as @xmath39 , hence in the present case , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mean absolute magnitude of sneia .",
    "the resulting value of h@xmath10 is the true cosmic value of h@xmath10 , because the hubble line holds out to @xmath42 and can be extended to @xmath43 with overlapping data from several snia collections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the sn _ hst _ project provided cepheids in eight sneia - hosting galaxies .",
    "revised period - color and p - l relations allowing for metallicity differences ( provided in their latest form for fundamental and overtone pulsators in @xcite ) were applied to derive cepheid distances @xcite . combining these distances in the summary paper of the sn _ hst _ project , including two additional galaxies from external sources , with the apparent @xmath35 magnitudes , yields a value of @xmath44 and hence with eq .",

    "the value has here been slightly revised to h@xmath126 to account for the high - weight trgb calibration of sneia .",

    "<S> allan sandage returned to the distance scale and the calibration of the hubble constant again and again during his active life , experimenting with different distance indicators . in 1952 </S>",
    "<S> his proof of the high luminosity of cepheids confirmed baade s revision of the distance scale ( h@xmath0 ) . during the next 25 years </S>",
    "<S> , he lowered the value to 75 and 55 . upon the arrival of the _ hubble space telescope _ , he observed cepheids to calibrate the mean luminosity of nearby type ia supernovae ( sneia ) which , used as standard candles , led to the cosmic value of h@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> eventually he turned to the tip of the red - giant branch ( trgb ) as a very powerful distance indicator . </S>",
    "<S> a compilation of 176 trgb distances yielded a mean , very local value of h@xmath2 and shed light on the streaming velocities in the local supercluster . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , trgb distances are now available for six sneia ; if their mean luminosity is applied to distant sneia , one obtains h@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the weighted mean of the two _ independent _ large - scale calibrations yields h@xmath4 within 3.6% . </S>"
