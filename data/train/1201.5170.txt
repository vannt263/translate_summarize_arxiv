    "one dimensional antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains show various physical properties under strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "they have offered many fascinating phenomena as a stage of both theoretical and experimental studies for many years . while an uniform antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain is gapless for half - integer spins , it has an exotic ground state with a finite gap for integer spins .",
    "@xcite this gapped phase is called haldane phase . the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain is not exactly solvable except for @xmath5 .",
    "however , the haldane phase could be understood in terms of the solvable affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki model  @xcite .",
    "its exact groundstate can be constructed in terms of valence bonds ( singlet pairs of constituent @xmath5 s ) .",
    "bond - alternating antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the bond alternation ratio , is an interesting generalization of the haldane gap problem . in this model , for spin quantum number @xmath8 , the system shows @xmath9 successive quantum phase transitions in @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this may be understood , in the aklt picture , as follows . in the limit of @xmath11 ,",
    "all the valence bonds are placed on the `` odd '' links between sites @xmath12 . in the opposite limit @xmath13 ,",
    "all the valence bonds are placed on the `` even '' links between sites @xmath14 .",
    "they correspond to completely dimerized states . by changing the number of valence bonds on odd and even links",
    ", we can construct @xmath15 aklt - type states with varying degree of dimerization .",
    "each of these aklt - type states represents the @xmath15 gapped phases , separated by the @xmath9 quantum phase transitions .",
    "each of the transitions may be regarded as a rearrangement of valence bonds , in which one valence bond is transferred between neighboring links .    in the case of an integer spin @xmath8 , @xmath15",
    "gapped phases can be classified into two categories : one with an even number of valence bonds on every link , and the other with an odd number of valence bonds .",
    "the latter is a ( symmetry - protected ) topological phase ; in the presence of global @xmath16 symmetry of @xmath17-rotation about @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes , it is characterized by spontaneous breaking of a _ hidden _",
    "@xmath20 symmetry  @xcite , which can be detected by the string order parameter .",
    "@xcite more generally , the topological phase is also protected by either the time - reversal symmetry or the lattice inversion symmetry about a link , and is characterized by exact two - fold degeneracy of entire entanglement spectrum .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we focus on the simple case of @xmath0 . here",
    ", the @xmath21 gapped phases consist of two dimer phases ( at large and small values of @xmath7 ) and the @xmath0 haldane phase in a range of @xmath7 including @xmath22 . as mentioned above , being an exotic `` topological phase '' , the haldane state has been studied vigorously .",
    "in contrast , the dimer phase may be regarded as a trivial phase as far as the ground - state properties are concerned , and has been relatively less studied .",
    "in fact , the system is exactly solvable in the dimer limit @xmath23 , where the system is reduced to a two - body problem .",
    "however , dynamical properties , which are related to excited states , are not necessarily trivial even in the dimer phase .",
    "while quantum phases are usually classified with respect to order parameters in the ground state , they are not sufficient for elucidation of the excited states . thus the dimer phase , although without any nontrivial order , has a possibility of exhibiting a rich structure in the excitations . in addition , it would be also interesting to compare dynamical properties between the dimer phase and the haldane phase .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we attempt to study the dynamical properties in the @xmath0 dimer phase , especially in the neighborhood of the quantum critical point .",
    "theoretical study of haldane gap has been , without doubt , stimulated by discovery of several model materials , such as ni(c@xmath4h@xmath24n@xmath25)@xmath4(no@xmath4)clo@xmath3 ( abbreviated to nenp ) and ni(c@xmath26h@xmath27n@xmath4)@xmath4n@xmath28(pf@xmath29 ) ( abbreviated to ndmap ) .",
    "fortunately , materials representing the @xmath0 bond - alternating antiferromagnetic chain  , such as ni(c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath3)(no@xmath4)clo@xmath3 ( abbreviated to ntenp )  @xcite and [ ni(333-tet)(@xmath30-n@xmath28)@xmath31(clo@xmath3)@xmath32 were also discovered , and the bond - alternation ratio @xmath7 was identified in these materials . in the latter system , quite remarkably , @xmath7 turns out to be exactly ( within experimental accuracy ) at the critical point separating the haldane and dimer phases .",
    "@xcite in ntenp , on the other hand , @xmath7 is slightly smaller than the critical value .",
    "@xcite that is , the system belongs to the dimer phase , but in vicinity of the quantum critical point .",
    "thus ntenp offers an ideal playground to study nontrivial dynamics in the dimer phase .",
    "dynamical properties of ntenp are studied experimentally by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) ,  @xcite and are numerically studied by using a continued - fraction method based on the lanczos algorithm @xcite . however , in order to better understand the dynamics in ntenp and also in related materials in a unified way , it would be desirable to develop a coherent theoretical picture . in this paper , we present a field theoretical approach to the problem , which we hope would serve the purpose .    at a quantum critical point ,",
    "physical quantities are often constrained by the conformal invariance , and the system is described by a conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "near the critical point , the system could be understood by a cft with a small ( but relevant ) perturbation . in this paper , we follow this strategy , making use of the feature of ntenp that the bond - alternating ratio is in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "based on the obtained effective theory , we elucidate the dynamical properties of ntenp and discuss preceding experimental and numerical results . furthermore",
    ", we make predictions on raman scattering experiment which has not yet been carried out .",
    "in fact , ntenp has a sizable spin anisotropy ; it is better described , instead of eq .  , by the following hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath7 and @xmath35 represent bond alternation and uniaxial anisotropy , respectively . for ntenp , these parameters are @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the spin anisotropy axis ( which is determined by the chain axis ) is taken to be @xmath19-direction . in this paper",
    ", we ignore the in - plane anisotropy @xmath38 and the exchange anisotropy , which are expected to be smaller than @xmath35 in ntenp .",
    "the lattice constant between neighboring two spins is set to unity .",
    "the critical point @xmath39 , where energy gap is closed , is about 0.6 at @xmath40 .",
    "it is a function of @xmath35 which is numerically evaluated in ref .  .",
    "according to them , @xmath39 is almost constant for @xmath41 . in ntenp , @xmath42",
    "and thus we can assume that @xmath43 .",
    "the actual bond - alternating ratio of ntenp is @xmath44 , and the system is certainly in the dimer phase .",
    "however , it can be still regarded as a vicinity of the quantum critical point .    at the critical point @xmath45 ,",
    "the system is mapped to a tl liquid ,  @xcite in the low - energy limit .",
    "@xcite it is nothing but the theory of free boson field @xmath46 with the lagrangian density , @xmath47 let @xmath48 be the compactification radius of boson field , @xmath49 the compactification radius determines critical exponents of the tl liquid .",
    "this may be understood as a consequence of `` quantization '' of vertex operators required by the compactification .",
    "for example , the vertex operators @xmath50 must have the coefficient @xmath51 with an integer @xmath52 , in order to be single - valued under the compactification  .",
    "the scaling dimension of the vertex operator @xmath53 is known@xcite as @xmath54 the operator is relevant ( irrelevant ) in the renormalization - group ( rg ) sense , if the scaling dimension is smaller ( greater ) than @xmath55 .",
    "thus , among the vertex operators of the above form , @xmath56 is the most relevant . as we will discuss later",
    ", in the present application @xmath48 is somewhat smaller than the su(2 ) symmetric value @xmath57 , implying @xmath56 is the only relevant operator in the family @xmath53 .    when @xmath58 , the system acquires a gap and it is no longer described by the tl liquid ( [ eq : tl ] ) .",
    "however , if @xmath59 is small , as it is the case in ntenp , the low - energy effective theory would be given by the tl liquid with a perturbation .",
    "we postulate that the leading perturbation is the most relevant operator permitted under the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) : @xmath60 .",
    "hence the low - energy effective theory for small @xmath61 should be following sine - gordon ( sg ) field theory , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the constant that is proportional to @xmath64 and @xmath48 is the compactification radius of boson field at the critical point .",
    "when @xmath45 , @xmath63 equals zero and eq .",
    "( [ eq : sine - gordon ] ) is reduced to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tl ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that we use @xmath48 at the critical point @xmath39 in this construction ( [ eq : sine - gordon ] ) for @xmath65 .",
    "the compactification radius @xmath48 is well defined only at the critical point and the precise determination of @xmath48 is subtle for @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath48 obtained at @xmath66 should be a reasonable approximation as long as @xmath59 is small .",
    "we also note that @xmath48 at the critical point @xmath39 is a function of @xmath35 .",
    "the sg field theory is integrable and its exact solution is known .",
    "@xcite in this study , we analyze the low - energy spectrum of ntenp using the exact solution of the sg field theory , where the original spin hamiltonian is mapped .",
    "we thus refer to this exact solution in the next section .",
    "the sg field theory has the lorentz invariance , hence the energy of the elementary excitations obey the relativistic dispersion relation @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the spin - wave velocity which plays the role of the speed of light , @xmath69 is the momentum , and @xmath70 is the mass of the excitation ( in the unit of energy ) , which represents the lowest creation energy of each elementary excitations .",
    "the elementary excitations of the sg field theory ( [ eq : sine - gordon ] ) consist of a soliton , an antisoliton and several breathers .",
    "the soliton and the antisoliton have the same mass @xmath71 .",
    "breathers are bound states of a soliton and an antisoliton .",

    "remarkably , the exact mass ratio was also derived as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath71 are respectively the @xmath52-th breather mass and the soliton mass . here",
    "we note that the breather mass @xmath77 does not exceed twice the soliton mass @xmath78 .",
    "physically , this can be interpreted as follows .",
    "if the mass of a breather were larger than @xmath78 , the breather would decay into free soliton and antisoliton , and would not constitute a stable elementary excitation .",
    "it should be emphasized that the mass ratio ( [ eq : massratio ] ) and the number of different breathers depend only on the boson field compactification radius @xmath48 , which is a function of @xmath35 .",
    "the above picture of elementary excitations implies the spectrum of the excited states schematically described in fig .",
    "[ fig : sine - gordon ] .",
    "each elementary excitation obeys the relativistic dispersion ( [ eq : relativistic_dispersion ] ) with a species - dependent mass @xmath70 and the common spin - wave velocity @xmath68 . above the energy @xmath78",
    ", there is a continuum of excited states , corresponding to scattering states of two or more elementary excitations .",

    "owing to the lorentz invariance of the theory , the excitation energies obey the relativistic dispersion relation  .",
    ", width=288 ]    the elementary excitations of ntenp is understood as the corresponding elementary excitations of the sg field theory .",
    "the boson field compactification radius @xmath48 of ntenp determines the mass ratio between a soliton and breathers and the number of different breathers correspond to ntenp .",
    "in passing , we note that , for an isotropic system , the su(2 ) symmetry requires @xmath84 .",
    "the exact solution of the sg theory implies that there are two breathers , and the mass of the 1st breather is degenerate with soliton / antisoliton , forming a su(2 ) triplet .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the second breather is @xmath85 times that of the triplet .",
    "however , this does not quite agree with the numerical results .",
    "this is due to the marginal perturbation to the sg theory , which generally exists in the su(2 ) symmetric system . only with an appropriate strength of next - nearest neighbor interaction ,",
    "the marginal operator can be eliminated and the above prediction of the sg theory is realized  @xcite . in this paper , however , we consider a system with a substantial anisotropy , where the marginal operator is absent .",
    "thus the simple sg theory   is expected to be a good low - energy effective theory of the system .",
    "we are now in a position to apply the relation ( [ eq : massratio ] ) to the system of ntenp . here",
    "we note again that the critical point @xmath39 and the compactification radius @xmath48 at this point are a function of the uniaxial anisotropy @xmath35 . at @xmath40 , @xmath48",
    "is determined as @xmath86 by the @xmath87 symmetry of the system .",
    "the variation of @xmath48 at several values of @xmath35 is already studied numerically by using cft and the level spectroscopy method , by chen et al .",
    "@xcite the parameter @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath35 in ref .",
    "correspond to @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively , in the notation of the present paper .",
    "thus , for ntenp with @xmath93 , we find @xmath94 that implies @xmath95 .",
    "it follows that this effective sg field theory for ntenp has the first breather only .",
    "the breather / soliton mass ratio is @xmath96 accordingly , the energy spectrum of ntenp based on the sg field theory picture appears to be the following : the lowest excited state is a degenerate doublet corresponds to the soliton and the antisoliton , the next lowest excited state is a single mode corresponds to the breather , and an excitation continuum starts from the energy twice the soliton mass .",
    "this spectrum is schematically described in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntenpspectrum ] .      the dynamical structure factor ( dsf )",
    "is defined as the fourier transform of the correlation function .",
    "it is an important quantity , as the differential cross section in an ins is proportional to the dsf .",
    "the @xmath30 ( @xmath97 ) component of the dsf at zero temperature is @xmath98 & = \\sum_n \\delta(\\omega - ( e_n - e_0 ) ) \\",

    ". here it should be noted that , in the systems with a bond alternation such as ntenp , the width of the brillouin zone is reduced to half of that of the uniform chain .",
    "namely , the conserved crystal momentum can be defined as @xmath105 which is defined on the reduced brillouin zone @xmath106 in particular , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are both identified with the center of the reduced brillouin zone @xmath109 .",
    "however , it should be noted that , the dsf is _ not _ equivalent for @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this could be easily understood by considering the limit of zero dimerization , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are certainly distinguishable .",
    "the operator @xmath112 and @xmath113 are different operators and thus give different dsfs . in the presence of dimerization ,",
    "they are governed by the same selection rule .",
    "the matrix elements , however , are generally different .",
    "the summation in eq . ( [ eq : dsf ] ) is taken over all intermediate states , but many of the matrix elements vanish due to selection rules . while excited states @xmath100 contain one or more elementary excitations , only the states which have non - vanishing overlap with @xmath114 contribute to the dsf .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate each component of the dsf , it is important to know what kind of elementary excitations are created by applying @xmath115 on the ground state @xmath99 .",
    "for example , if @xmath116 contains a single soliton state , there must be a contribution proportional to @xmath117 , to @xmath118 .      in order",
    "to clarify which elementary excitation is created by application of each spin operator , we need to know the correspondence between the operators in the sg field theory and those in the original spin system . in principle",
    ", this would follow from a microscopic derivation of the effective sg field theory from the spin model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . however , the microscopic derivation is rather complicated and the correspondence can not be easily established .",
    "a possible derivation starts from the bosonization of two @xmath5 chains and then introduces a strong ferromagnetic coupling between them , to form a @xmath0 chain effectively@xcite .",
    "instead of pursuing this direction , we shall develop a simple ansatz for the correspondence , based on the dimer limit @xmath11 .    in the dimer limit",
    ", the problem is reduced to a two - spin problem , and thus can be exactly solved .",
    "two @xmath0 s coupled with the heisenberg antiferromagnetic exchange , @xmath119 has the singlet groundstate with energy @xmath120 , triplet excited states with energy @xmath121 , quintet excited states with energy @xmath122 .",
    "now let us introduce the uniaxial anisotropy @xmath35 to the dimer , and consider the hamiltonian @xmath123 the singlet groundstate is perturbed by the anisotropy , and given by @xmath124 with the groundstate energy @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the normalization constant .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy splits the triplet and quintet excited states .",
    "each state can be labelled by the total magnetization @xmath128 , which is still a good quantum number .",
    "since the uniaxial anisotropy does not break the @xmath17-rotation symmetry under rotation about @xmath75-axis .",
    "thus , the triplet states are split into a singlet with @xmath129 , which is denoted by @xmath130 , and a doublet @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "the doublet states are given by @xmath133 with the energy @xmath134 , while the singlet is given by @xmath135 with the energy @xmath136 .",
    "for @xmath137 , which is the case for ntenp , the doublet states @xmath138 are lower in energy than the singlet @xmath130 .    in a similar way ,",
    "the quintet states are split into a singlet with @xmath129 and two doublets with @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "however , as we will argue below , once we move away from the dimer limit , they decay into excitations corresponding to @xmath141 .",
    "thus , for the purpose of classification of elementary excitations , it is sufficient to consider the ( split ) triplet @xmath141 .    given these states in single dimers , the states in the entire system is given as follows : the ground state is the state that all dimers form @xmath142 .",
    "the lowest excited state is the state that @xmath143 or @xmath144 is excited in one of the dimers , while the other dimers remain in @xmath142 . similarly in the next lowest excited state , @xmath145 is excited in one of the dimers and the other dimers form @xmath142 . here",
    ", we denote these states @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "in fact , in a system which consists of @xmath150 dimers ( @xmath104 sites ) , there are @xmath150 degenerate states for each class of @xmath151 , where @xmath152 , corresponding to the location of the excited dimer .",

    "we can also define their fourier transform @xmath158 where @xmath152 , labeled by the crystal momentum @xmath159 defined in the reduced brillouin zone  .    in this paper , we are primarily interested in the dsf around the antiferromagnetic wavevector , @xmath160 . here , the matrix elements of spin operators among these states are found to be : @xmath161 generically if @xmath162 , and @xmath163    now let us consider increasing @xmath7 from zero",
    ". with a nonzero @xmath7 , an excited state in a single dimer can `` hop '' to the neighboring sites , giving rise to a dispersion .",
    "it should be noted that , in the dimerized limit , the momentum basis   as well as the localized basis @xmath164 , represents @xmath150 degenerate excited states .",
    "however , when the interdimer interaction is introduced with @xmath165 , momentum basis  , but not the localized basis gives a set of approximate eigenstates if @xmath7 is sufficiently small .",
    "now the energy of the excited state @xmath166 depends on the momentum @xmath159 ; the dependence is nothing but the dispersion relation .",
    "since the structure of the triplet split into the doublet and the singlet by the anisotropy is very similar between the single dimer and the sg field theory , it would be natural to assume that the structure of the excitation does not qualitatively change in @xmath167 . under this assumption ,",
    "the states in the dimer limit @xmath11 , @xmath168 , @xmath147 , @xmath169 and @xmath149 are considered to be smoothly connected to , at @xmath170 , the ground state @xmath171 , and the single soliton state @xmath172 , the single antisoliton state @xmath173 , the single breather state @xmath174 , each with the momentum @xmath159 .",

    "conversely , when each spin operator creates a single elementary excitation , its species is uniquely determined as soliton , antisoliton , and breather .",
    "hence the single - particle peak due to the soliton / antisoliton contribute only to @xmath226 and @xmath227 , and that due to the breather does to only @xmath228 .",
    "the intensity ratio between the lowest excited states in @xmath226 and @xmath228 are evaluated from the result in fig .",

    "however , the matrix elements of @xmath233 vanishes due to the relation   for each elementary excitations , then only those of @xmath234 contribute . for example",

    "[ fig : matelement ] for the soliton , the antisoliton and the breather , respectively .",
    "according to refs .  , two main peaks are present in the ins spectrum of ntenp .",
    "the first peak occurs from the fluctuation of spin @xmath75 , @xmath180 components and the second from that of @xmath19 component . in an inelastic scan at the center of the brillouin zone ,",
    "the energy ratio between the peak from spin @xmath75 , @xmath180 component and that from @xmath19 component is about @xmath240 , and the intensity of the second peak is about @xmath241 times that of the first peak .",
    "furthermore , the dsf in the model   under a transverse magnetic field @xmath242 is numerically studied using the continued - fraction method@xcite .",
    "their result at @xmath243 can be compared with the present study .",
    "the ratio between the energies correspond to the first peak in @xmath244 and @xmath245 is @xmath246 and the intensity of the first peak of @xmath245 is about @xmath247 times that of @xmath244 .",
    "we also note that , the ratio of the lowest gap to @xmath248 and @xmath249 excitations in our exact diagonalization study , shown in fig .  [ fig : ene_enegap ] , is consistent with the predicted mass ratio @xmath223 .",
    "this gives an additional support to our field - theory analysis .",
    "the lowest - energy peak in the ins spectrum in refs .  , which corresponds@xcite to the lowest excited state in @xmath244 , is the contribution of the soliton / antisoliton in our picture .",

    "our results that the mass ratio between soliton and breather @xmath250 and that the creation operator of soliton , antisoliton and breather is respectively @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , agree very well with these results .",
    "our result   on the intensity ratio also shows a good agreement .",
    "not only the peak positions but also the polarization of the dsf is consistent .",
    "our field - theory approach thus provides a coherent theoretical picture describing the preceding experimental and numerical results , at least at zero magnetic field .",
    "a slight disagreement with experiments may be attributed to the following factors .",
    "first , we neglected the in - plane anisotropy @xmath251 , which must be present in ntenp with a triclinic crystal structure .",
    "furthermore , the low - energy asymptotic description based on the sg field theory is not exact for ntenp due to its finite energy gap .",
    "more recently , esr study of ntenp was reported in ref .  .",
    "we will make a brief comment on esr in sec .",
    "[ sec : magfield ] .",
    "as a new application of the present approach , in this section , we discuss the raman scattering ( rs ) spectrum of ntenp and predict its peak positions . following our discussion in sec .",
    "[ subsec : dsf ] , we first identify the non - vanishing matrix elements in the dimer limit @xmath23 , and then extend the results to @xmath252 using the continuity of the excitation structure from @xmath23 to @xmath253 .    according to the theory of exchange - scattering in magnetic compounds , the spectral function @xmath254 for the scattered light at zero temperature is given by  @xcite @xmath255 where @xmath256 and @xmath257 are the ground state and the excited state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , whose energy eigenvalues are @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and @xmath258 is the effective interaction for the exchange - scattering of light , @xmath259 for the present one dimensional system ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . here ,",
    "@xmath260 , @xmath261 are unit polarization vectors of incident and scattered light , and @xmath262 is a unit vector connecting the spin sites @xmath263 and @xmath264 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : raman ] ) , @xmath265 is constant in the present system ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ; once the experimental apparatus is set up , @xmath260 and @xmath261 are fixed .",
    "( for a recent discussion of related problems , see ref .  .",
    ") thus , we just need to know matrix elements of the operator @xmath266 in order to calculate rs spectrum .",
    "this effective raman hamiltonian  ( [ eq : raman ] ) , taking the form of an inner products of spin operators , possesses several symmetries .",
    "consequently , there are following conserved quantities : the total magnetization @xmath183 , the momentum and the link parity of the states .",
    "link parity transformation is a reflection with respect to a link . in the systems with bond alternation such as ntenp ,",
    "the link parity is conserved but the site parity ( reflection with respect to a site ) is not conserved .",
    "the link parity operator @xmath215 satisfies @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the identity operator . as mentioned above , the selection rule for rs is quite different from that for ins represented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsf ] ) .",
    "this difference leads to distinct peak positions between the ins and the rs spectrum of ntenp .    in what follows",
    ", we discuss the overlaps between @xmath100 and @xmath267 to detect the excited states that contribute to the rs spectrum . for this purpose , here we collect the conserved quantities in the present system ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) again : the total magnetization @xmath183 , the momentum @xmath159 associated with the invariance under the translation by two sites , and the link parity .",
    "first we analyze the @xmath181 case .",
    "the ground state @xmath146 is the eigenstate of @xmath70 with the eigenvalue @xmath195 , while the lowest excited states @xmath147 and @xmath148 are that with the eigenvalue @xmath268 and @xmath269 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath258 conserves the total magnetization @xmath70 , these excited states do not have overlap with @xmath270 , and do not contribute to the rs spectrum .",
    "thus in what follows , we only discuss the subspace with @xmath249 in order to detect the states having non - vanishing overlap with @xmath270 .",
    "the three low - energy excited states in this subspace , applied the same notation as the preceding one , are @xmath149 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 , from the lowest in energy , in the dimer limit @xmath181 .",
    "they correspond to the single breather state , the scattering state of a soliton and an antisoliton , and the scattering state of two breathers , respectively at @xmath170 .",
    "the link parity of the ground state @xmath146 and these states are calculated as follows : for a given state @xmath273 , we denote its mapping by the link parity as @xmath274 . as a preparation",
    ", we first discuss the link parity of the states in a single dimer .",
    "the state @xmath142 is link - parity even : latexmath:[\\ ] ] next we discuss the link parity of excited states in the subspace with @xmath249 . a state with a fixed position of the excited dimer is not an eigenstate of @xmath215 nor of the momentum .",
    "for example , the state @xmath149 with the first dimer excited is transformed under @xmath215 as @xmath280 on the other hand , momentum eigenstates can be constructed as a linear combination of @xmath281 since the ground state @xmath146 has zero momentum and @xmath258 is translationally invariant , only the zero - momentum excited states contribute to the rs spectrum .",
    "we thus only have to examine the zero - momentum combination @xmath282 it turns out that this is link - parity odd : @xmath283 since the ground state @xmath168 is link - parity even , @xmath284 appears not to have the overlap with @xmath285 . similarly , @xmath286 and @xmath287 are link - parity odd , and do not have the overlap .    in the above analysis",
    ", we considered the dimerized limit @xmath288 .",
    "however , the hamiltonian respects the link parity @xmath215 for any @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the adiabatic continuity of the excited states , which was demonstrated numerically in sec .  [ sec.dimer ] , implies that the corresponding states belong to the same eigenvalue of @xmath215 for any @xmath289 .",
    "it follows that , _",
    "none _ of the `` single elementary excitation '' states @xmath290 ( @xmath214 ) ( corresponding to a single soliton , a single antisoliton and a single breather for @xmath170 ) contribute to the rs spectrum for @xmath291 .    thus only the states in the excitation continuum have the possibility of having non - vanishing overlap with @xmath270 .",
    "in particular , the matrix element with the `` two elementary excitations '' state @xmath292 does not vanish in the dimer limit .",
    "this transition is not forbidden by the selection rule due to the link parity @xmath215 .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that it remains non - zero for @xmath289 . indeed , we examined the matrix element @xmath293 numerically for @xmath289 .",
    "the result , obtained after extrapolation to infinite size from the systems with length @xmath294 and @xmath295 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raman matelement ] .",
    "this confirms that the matrix element does not vanish within the dimer phase , as expected .",
    "the structure of excitations is continuous up to the critical point @xmath45 , also in this regard .",
    "thus the `` two elementary excitations '' state @xmath296 should contribute to the rs spectrum of nenp . in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath170 , this state may be regarded as the scattering state of a soliton and an antisoliton .",
    "-dependence of the matrix element @xmath293 .",
    "( @xmath185 )   the state @xmath297 corresponds to the scattering state of a soliton and an antisoliton in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath194 .",
    "insets : extrapolation of the matrix element at @xmath186 to @xmath187.,width=312 ]    from these results , we predict that the sharp peaks corresponding to creation of single elementary excitation are absent in the rs spectrum of ntenp .",
    "the rs spectrum consists only of excitation continuum , and is qualitatively different from its ins spectrum .",
    "this difference is schematically described in fig .",
    "[ fig : ins ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : raman ] .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss the effect of weak magnetic field . first we consider magnetic field @xmath298 applied in @xmath19 direction .",
    "total magnetization @xmath299 is then a conserved quantity .",
    "thus , the dispersion of each elementary excitation are simply shifted according to its magnetization as @xmath300 phase transition occurs when the bottom of the soliton dispersion touches zero at @xmath301 .",
    "next we consider the effect of magnetic field @xmath302 applied perpendicular to the anisotropy axis @xmath19 . in this case , the total magnetization @xmath299 is no longer conserved .",
    "therefore , a rearrangement of elementary excitations would occur .",
    "the mixing may be described by the effective @xmath303 hamiltonian in the one - soliton , one - breather , one - antisoliton subspace : @xmath304 where @xmath305 is the mass ratio  .",
    "diagonalizing this , we obtain the masses of 3 elementary excitations in the transverse magnetic field as @xmath306 namely , one of the elementary excitations ( which is an antisymmetric linear combination of soliton and antisoliton ) has constant mass @xmath71 .",
    "the other two masses depend nonlinearly on @xmath302 .",
    "the lowest mass @xmath307 is reduced to zero at a critical field , where a phase transition occurs .",
    "this is essentially identical to the preceding analysis of anisotropic haldane chains in ref .   which was applied to ndmap  @xcite and ntenp  @xcite , where the in - plane anisotropy @xmath251 is also taken into account .",
    "as pointed out in refs .  , the scattering intensity corresponding to the higher - energy elementary excitation ( with the @xmath308 ) is suppressed in a moderate transverse field , where the elementary excitation is absorbed into the excitation continuum . systematic analysis of the effects of the transverse field in the sg theory framework is left for future .",
    "this will be necessary for discussion of esr spectra@xcite in the present approach .",
    "in this study , we found that the low - energy excitations of ntenp are well described in the framework of the sg field theory .",
    "the elementary excitations of ntenp correspond to the soliton , the antisoliton and the breather , which are respectively created by applying @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 on the ground state .",
    "their correspondence with the original spin model is deduced from the dimer limit @xmath11 , where the original model is exactly solvable , and the numerical exact diagonalization calculation which shows that the excitation structure is smoothly connected from the dimer limit @xmath23 to @xmath309 .",
    "this picture of excitations well explains the preceding ins experiments on ntenp and numerical calculations of the dsf .",
    "based on the established picture , we found that the sharp peaks , each of which corresponds to a single elementary excitation , vanish in the rs spectrum of ntenp .",
    "this is qualitatively distinct from the ins spectrum .",
    "a slight disagreement with the experiments may be caused by the neglect of the @xmath251 term anisotropy in the model hamiltonian  , and the use of the effective field theory , which is only asymptotically exact in the low - energy limit ,    although our primary focus in this paper was ntenp , the present result could be applied to other systems in the dimer phase of the hamiltonian  . depending on the value of the uniaxial anisotropy @xmath35 ,",
    "the number of breathers changes : the system has two breathers for @xmath310 , one breather for @xmath311 and no breather for @xmath312 .",
    "besides the bond - alternating chain  , there are also completely different class of systems that are described by the sg field theory .",
    "an example in quantum magnetism is the @xmath5 antiferromagnetic chain with a staggered field .",
    "it describes several materials in a magnetic field , such as cu benzoate .",
    "while this system is physically quite different from the model discussed in the present paper , they are both described by sg theory .",
    "@xcite the difference appears in the correspondence between the spin operators and the boson field .",
    "in fact , in the staggered field case , soliton and antisoliton couple to @xmath313 while @xmath52-th breather couples to @xmath314 if @xmath52 is even , and to @xmath315 if @xmath52 is odd .",
    "( here we define the direction of the staggered field as @xmath75 direction . ) as a consequence , observable spectra are quite different from the s=1 chain studied in the present paper .    as a final remark ,",
    "in the context of the sg field theory , difference between the dimer phase and the haldane phase is nothing but the sign of the cosine term in the lagrangian density ( [ eq : sine - gordon ] ) .",
    "this change should not yield a qualitative difference in the properties of the sg theory , although its physical consequences may be altered .",
    "the sg field theory could provide a starting point for a unified understanding of dynamics in different phases of @xmath0 antiferromagnetic chains . in a related but somewhat different context , anisotropic @xmath0 chains without bond alternation",
    "was studied in terms of sg theory.@xcite it would be interesting to compare the two systems in more detail .",
