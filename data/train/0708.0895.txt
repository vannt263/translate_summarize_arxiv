    "single and few electron control by electric means in semiconductor quantum dots would be valuable for spintronics , quantum information , and spin qubits@xcite .",
    "adiabatic time evolution of degenerate eigenstates of a quantum system provides a means for controlling individual quantum states through the generation of non - abelian matrix berry phases@xcite .",
    "this method can be used to perform universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "there are several semiconductor nanosystems that exhibit matrix berry phases : they include excitons@xcite , cdse nanocrystals@xcite , and acceptor states of p - type semiconductors@xcite .",
    "it is desirable to generate and detect matrix berry phases by _ all electric means _ in semiconductor nanosystems .",
    "recently we have demonstrated theoretically that it is possible to control _ electrically _ electron spins of ii - v and iii - v n - type semiconductor quantum dots@xcite and rings@xcite by changing the shape of the electric confinement potential .",
    "the mechanism is based on spin orbit couplings which generate non - abelian vector potentials .",
    "the main ingredients of it are : [ a ] time - reversal symmetry , which leads to double degeneracy@xcite , which is depicted schematically in fig.[fig : shape1 ] .",
    "[ b ] non - abelian u(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "[ c ] adiabatic changes that break the parity symmetry of the electric confinement potential of the dot .",
    "when several electrons are present the matrix berry phase can be generated only when odd number of electrons are in the dot .",
    "in such a case the effect of correlations can be included in a compact way ( exchange effects do not affect the non - abelian vector potentials)@xcite . it should be emphasized that the presence of the matrix berry phase follows from general symmetry considerations .",
    "the matrix berry phase can be present even in the absence of the spin - orbit terms .",
    "a noteworthy example is semiconductor quantum dot pumps@xcite , which can be understood as a manifestation of a matrix berry phase@xcite .",
    "let us give a brief explanation of matrix berry phases .",
    "the electron state at time @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the instantaneous basis states satisfying @xmath4 for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the hamiltonian with the eigenenergy @xmath7 at time @xmath1 ) .",
    "the matrix berry phase @xmath8 connects @xmath9 to @xmath10 , and is given by @xmath11 where time slices are ordered as @xmath12 .",
    "the matrix vector potentials @xmath13 @xmath14 are integrated along the path c in the parameter space in the order of increasing time .",
    "the path c is parameterized in time as @xmath15 .",
    "the matrix berry phase is independent of the functions @xmath16 as long as they describe the same path c.    in applying matrix berry phases to ii - vi and iii - v semiconductor quantum dots there are several issues that need to be addressed .",
    "one issue is whether the line integral along c can be _ generally _ converted into an areal integration over a in the expression for the matrix berry phase . for this purpose",
    "it is useful to consider the field strength 2-form @xmath17 where @xmath18\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 . for a small area",
    "a it can be shown@xcite that the matrix berry phase is @xmath20 for an arbitrarily large a there are two cases:[1 ] if @xmath21=0 $ ] , the curvature reduces to @xmath22 and we can use stokes theorem to convert the line integral along c to an areal integration over a @xmath23 [ 2 ] when @xmath21\\neq0 $ ] it is not possible to convert the line integral into an areal integration .",
    "we will investigate the applicability of stokes theorem in the case of rashba and dresselhaus terms .",
    "second issue is that it is often complicated to calculate the non - abelian vector potentials , and , consequently , it is difficult to compare experimental and theoretical results .",
    "this is especially so when many electrons are present",
    ". it would be useful to have a simple , yet general , mathematical expression for the matrix berry phase .",
    "we will show that the matrix berry phase is a unitary @xmath24 matrix and that it may be thought of as a spin rotation matrix@xcite .",
    "a spin rotation matrix is characterized by the direction and angle of rotation .",
    "it is unclear how the geometric properties of the adiabatic path are reflected on them .",
    "we show in this paper how the information of the path c can be encoded in the direction and angle of the rotation .",
    "another issue is whether the matrix berry phase can be detected in a transport measurement , which would complement the detection of matrix berry phases by infrared optical measurements@xcite .",
    "let us now give a brief summary of the main results of this paper .",
    "first , the matrix berry phase has the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 are pauli spin matrices and @xmath27 is the number of periodic adiabatic cycles .",
    "the information about the _ closed _ curve in the parameter space is encoded into the rotation axis @xmath28 and the angle of rotation @xmath29 .",
    "the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 are real and complex numbers , respectively .",
    "this result is even valid for many electron systems with correlations as long as double degeneracy is present .",
    "the expression eq.([eq : matrix.berry0 ] ) is valid _ only _ at time @xmath32 , and it should be stressed that in the time interval @xmath33 the probability amplitudes @xmath34 and @xmath35 exhibit a much more complicated behavior , see fig.[fig : c1square.c1square.fit.dress ] .",
    "second , we find @xmath36 and @xmath37 when only the rashba term is present , and all the geometric information is contained in the rotation angle @xmath38 . we have derived an analytical expression for @xmath38 . furthermore ,",
    "remarkably @xmath21=0 $ ] and stokes theorem can be applied .",
    "when both rashba and dresselhaus terms are present each path has different @xmath39 and @xmath30 .",
    "we have investigated how they depend on the shape of each path .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath21\\neq0 $ ] and that stokes theorem can not be applied .",
    "third , we propose how the presence of the matrix berry phase can be measured in transport experiments by changing the electric confinement potential suddenly , see sec.iii .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig.[fig : potential_shape ] .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath40 .",
    "we take the two - dimensional potential to be @xmath41 , where the term @xmath42 represents a distortion of the two - dimensional harmonic potential .",
    "the strengths of the harmonic potentials are denoted by @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the characteristic lengths scales along x- and y - axis are @xmath45 . in our work",
    "the triangular potential @xmath46 is sufficiently strong and only the lowest energy subband is included .",
    "the characteristic length scale along the z - axis is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the rashba electric field applied along the z - axis .",
    "the rashba spin orbit term@xcite is @xmath49 and the dresselhaus spin orbit term@xcite is @xmath50 note that the rashba spin orbit constant @xmath51 _",
    "depends on the external electric field _ @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath52 are momentum operators ( @xmath53 and similarly with @xmath54 . ) .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is represented in the basis states @xmath55 of the harmonic oscillator states in the xy plane with spin component @xmath56 .",
    "the subband wavefunction @xmath57 is suppressed in the notation @xmath58 .",
    "let us take @xmath59 ( other values of @xmath43 can also be chosen ) .",
    "then the lowest eigenenergy state of @xmath60 is @xmath61 with the energy @xmath62 and the next lowest eigenenergy state is @xmath63 with the energy @xmath64 .",
    "the typical value of the energy spacing between the quantum dot levels , @xmath65 , is of order @xmath66 .",
    "it can be several times larger in self - assembled dots .",
    "the energy scale of the rashba term is @xmath67 , where the length scale @xmath68 is the lateral dimension of the quantum dot .",
    "the energy scale of the distortion potential is @xmath69 .",
    "its magnitude is of order @xmath70 , depending on the electric field applied along the y - axis .",
    "the energy scale of the dresselhaus term is @xmath71 , and it can be larger or smaller than the rashba term , depending on the material@xcite .",
    "here @xmath72 , and it originates from the second term of the dresselhaus term ( the first term in the dresselhaus term is zero in our model since @xmath73 ) .",
    "we will use a truncated version of the hamiltonian matrix , which makes it possible to write the eigenstates as a linear combination of four basis states made out of @xmath74 and spin degree of freedom : @xmath75 the advantage of this truncated model is that it is _",
    "exactly solvable_. in this paper we choose the following eigenstates of the lowest energy shell as the instantaneous basis vectors : @xmath76 the non - abelian vector potentials are evaluated with respect to these basis vectors .    in the following",
    "we choose the adiabatic parameters as the rashba energy and the distortion energy @xmath77 the cyclic adiabatic path is given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "+   +     +   +   +    when only the rashba term is present the structure of the non - abelian vector potentials is remarkably simple .",

    "it follows that the parameter @xmath36 and only one geometric number @xmath30 is needed .",
    "the matrix berry phase is given by @xmath89 one can show that @xmath90=0 $ ] when only the rashba term is present , and that stokes theorem can be applied , eq .",
    "( [ eq : stokes ] ) .",
    "the field strength has a simple form @xmath91 where @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "from this we can compute the rotation angle @xmath95 which gives @xmath96 .",
    "when both the rashba and dresselhaus terms are present stokes theorem is not applicable .",
    "we have investigated how @xmath97 and @xmath38 depend on the shape of the paths .",
    "they can be computed numerically by solving the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath98 the matrix elements @xmath88 are given by @xmath99 , where the sum over @xmath100 in @xmath88 is meant to be the sum over @xmath101 .",
    "we have considered elliptic paths with the area @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : geometry ] .",
    "( note that the dependence of @xmath105 on the adiabatic parameter @xmath106 is not well - known , but the essential physics does not depend on the exact functional form , as discussed in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "fig.[fig : geometry ] also shows numerical results for @xmath38 when only the rashba term is present .",
    "we have _ verified _ that these numerical results agree well with the results obtained from the equation eq.([eq : integ ] ) .",
    "+   +     +   +   +   +     +     +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +    let us first investigate the time evolution of the system in the presence of the rashba term .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation is solved using the runge - kutta method . for the parameters @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 we calculate @xmath112 and @xmath113 , see fig.[fig : c1square.c2square.fit ] .",
    "we can fit the data to @xmath114 , @xmath115 , with @xmath116 . in this case",
    "the matrix berry phase takes a simple form with @xmath36 .",
    "we have _ tested _ our numerical method as follows : for two different periods @xmath117 and @xmath118 we find the matrix berry phases are the same , i.e. , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the matrix berry phase is a geometric effect independent of how the path is parameterized .",
    "let us now include the dresselhaus spin orbit term as described in ref @xcite . in this case",
    "the matrix berry phase is more complicated since @xmath121 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath87 are non - zero and the off - diagonal elements @xmath88 are complex numbers . using the same parameters @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 as in the previous calculation , we have computed @xmath112 and @xmath113 , which are displayed in fig.[fig : c1square.c1square.fit.dress ] .",
    "these results can be fitted with the parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in both cases",
    "the numerical results are consistent with those of the analytical expression at @xmath32 , given by eq.([eq : matrix.berry0 ] ) . in the time interval",
    "@xmath33 the coefficients @xmath129 display a complicated behavior .",
    "it should be stressed that even when the adiabatic path is _ not _ closed the actual state @xmath130 is given by a nontrivial linear combination of the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath131 and @xmath132 . in this case a matrix phase of the form @xmath133 will appear , where the path @xmath134 is unclosed .",
    "we have investigated ii - vi and iii - v n - type semiconductor dots with spin orbit coupling terms and have shown in this paper that the geometric information of a closed adiabatic path can be encoded in the rotation axis and angle of the spin half matrix .",
    "this result is applicable even for strongly correlated states , as along as the states are doubly degenerate . in our truncated model for the hamiltonian",
    "the matrix berry phase can be found _ exactly _ when the rashba term is present . in this case",
    "the stokes theorem is applicable and the relevant field strength can be calculated analytically .",
    "even when the adiabatic path is _ not _ closed the actual state,@xmath130 , at time @xmath1 will not be the instantaneous eigenstate @xmath135 . instead it is a linear combination of the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath2 the expansion coefficients @xmath136 change in a non - trivial way in the interval @xmath33 , see figs.[fig : c1square.c2square.fit ] and [ fig : c1square.c1square.fit.dress ] .",
    "experimental investigations of matrix berry phases in ii - vi and iii - v semiconductor quantum dots would be most interesting .",
    "optical dipole measurements@xcite were proposed before@xcite . here",
    "we propose a transport measurement . in order to measure the matrix berry phase we perform the following set of manipulations :    1 .",
    "prepare an initial state by applying a small magnetic field and taking the zero field limit , as explained in detail in ref .",
    "2 .   perform an adiabatic cycle by changing @xmath106 and @xmath137 that defines the shape of the electric confinement potential , see fig.[fig : potential_shape](a ) .",
    "3 .   change suddenly the electric field along the z - axis so that the electron can tunnel out of the dot , see fig.[fig : potential_shape](b ) .",
    "4 .   measure the spin dependence of the tunneling current@xcite .",
    "5 .   repeat this set of procedures many times .    after this procedure",
    "we repeat the entire scheme one more time except the item 2 .",
    "the difference between spin - up ( down ) currents of these two schemes is a demonstration of the presence of the matrix berry phase .",
    "our truncated model can be applied to self - assembled quantum dots@xcite , which have large energy shell differences . in these dots",
    "exchange and correlation effects can be neglected@xcite , and it would be sufficient to consider only the electron in the last occupied energy shell . on the other hand , in gated quantum dots@xcite with smaller energy differences between the shells and with odd number of electrons correlation effects may be relevant . a computational scheme to calculate the matrix berry phase in such a system is developed in ref.@xcite .",
