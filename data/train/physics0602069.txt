    "one of the significant advances that is being made in nano - technology is the ability to manipulate small objects and particles , even to the level of single atoms .",
    "a highly focused optical beam can be used as an ` optical tweezer ' with which single atoms can be moved around . on an even more sophisticated level",
    ", optical beams can also be used to rotate or twist small particles . in the early 90 s allen and",
    "coworkers discovered that an optical beam can carry _ orbital angular momentum_@xcite ( in addition to spin angular mometum , which is associated with circular polarization ) .",
    "this angular momentum can be transferred to a small particle that absorbs the light .",
    "optical orbital angular momentum is associated with phase singularities , called _ optical vortices _ , which were discovered by nye and berry in the 60s.@xcite an optical vortex is a point on the cross section of a beam ( or a curved line moving along the beam ) . at this point",
    "the intensity of the beam is zero . around this point",
    "the phase increases by an integer multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "this integer is called the _ topological charge _ of the vortex .",
    "most of the time vortices only appear with topological charges of @xmath1 .",
    "the two signs represent two opposite helicities , which indicate whether the phase increases in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction around the phase singularity .",
    "the rate of increase of the phase around a vortex is not always a constant function of the azimuthal angle . for a _",
    "canonical _ vortex the rate of increase is constant and the vortex has an isotropic ( rotationally symmetric ) appearance .",
    "one can regard a _",
    "noncanonical _ vortex as the anisotropically scaled ( or stretched ) version of a canonical vortex .",
    "together with the direction or orientation of the scaling , the amount of anisotropy represents the _ morphology _ of the optical vortex .",
    "one can create an optical vortex in a beam with a _",
    "computer generated hologram_.@xcite this vortex then propagates along the beam to the point where it can be applied to rotate some small objects.@xcite unfortunately , the vortex does not always remain the same as it propagates . if there are more than one vortex in the beam they interact with each other and can even annihilate each other.@xcite moreover , in the late 90 s a group in spain@xcite performed an interesting experiment in which they demonstrated that the topological charge of an optical vortex can be inverted after the vortex bearing beam passed through a cylindrical lens . hence , under certain circumstances , even if there is only one vortex in the beam , it can change its shape ( morphology ) and even its topological charge .",
    "so the topological charge in a beam is not always conserved during propagation .",
    "what happens is that two ` vortices ' are brought in from infinity by means of an edge phase dislocation to cancel the vortex in the beam and replace it with a vortex of opposite topological charge .",
    "this happens because of the astigmatism that the beam picked up from the cylindrical lens .",
    "the topological charge is still _ locally _ conserved in that the net inward ( or outward ) flow of topological charge through a closed surface is always zero .",
    "one of the consequences of this observation is that there is a set of special planes in such an astigmatic beam where the topological charge is inverted.@xcite one of the questions one can ask is where these planes are located and what these locations depend on .",
    "here we report on the results of this investigation .",
    "it is well known that a single noncanonical vortex that propagates in a rotationally symmetric , stigmatic gaussian beam retains its morphology for as far as it propagates.@xcite when the rotational symmetry is broken or the beam picked up some astigmatism this situation is no longer true ",
    "the morphology of the vortex evolves during propagation .",
    "if the gaussian beam is asymmetrical ( elliptical ) but not astigmatic and the vortex is canonical in the waist of the gaussian beam , then , although the vortex becomes noncanonical , it does not change its topological charge .",
    "if it is noncanonical in the waist , there can be a region over which the topological charge of the vortex is inverted .",
    "a more detail analysis of these conditions is provided below . if the beam is astigmatic but symmetric in the sense that the rayleigh distances associated with the two transverse directions are equal , then the vortex can invert its topological charge irrespective of its initial morphology . hence it is both the morphology of the vortex and the astigmatism of the beam that determines whether topological charge inversion occurs .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define our notation for the beam and the morphology of the vortex in section [ notas ] .",
    "the general expressions for the trajectory of a single vortex with an arbitrary morphology propagating in a general asymmetrical and/or astigmatic gaussian beam are provided in section [ traj ] .",
    "the zeros of the denominator of these trajectories provide the locations for the flip planes . in section [ flipp ] these flip plane locations",
    "are investigated for various situations .",
    "we provide expressions for the anisotropy of the vortex as a function of the propagation distance in section [ anis ] to show that the anisotropy vanishes and changes sign at the locations of the flip planes , which confirms that topological charges inversion occurs at the flip plane locations .",
    "conclusions are provided in section [ concl ] .",
    "a vortex bearing gaussian beam can be expressed as a product of a complex valued polynomial function ( i.e.  the _ prefactor _ ) and a gaussian function .",
    "we ll define the propagation direction as the @xmath2-direction and the transverse directions as the @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions . here , we ll use normalized coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the waist size and the associated rayleigh range of the gaussian beam , respectively .",
    "an astigmatic gaussian beam has two different waists ( foci ) for two orthogonal transverse directions , which we define as the @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions , respectively .",
    "we define a _ central plane _ as the plane that is exactly halfway between the two focal planes of the astigmatic beam . for a stigmatic beam the central plane coincides with the waist of the gaussian beam .",
    "one can then quantify the amount of astigmatism by a parameter @xmath10 , which is defined as the distance from the central plane to one of the focal planes , normalized with respect to the nominal rayleigh range ( defined below ) .",
    "note that @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameters that is given as the ratio of the two most significant scale parameters in the beam .",
    "a gaussian beam can be asymmetric in the sense that the size of the beam waist may be different for the @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions , respectively . in this case",
    "we define , for the purpose of normalization , a _",
    "nominal _ waist size @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the waist sizes in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions , respectively .",
