    "this will need to be addressed in order to use snia in the next step in accuracy for a cosmological probe .",
    "dust attenuation affects both the observed snia rate and the distance modulus .",
    "extinction by dust occurs in three instances before observation of the snia light : ( 1 ) in our own milky way , ( 2 ) in intergalactic space , and ( 3 ) in the host galaxy of the snia .    galactic extinction ( 1 ) is a well - studied problem , because it is an ubiquitous one .",
    "@xcite produced a map of galactic extinction based on hi maps and distant galaxy counts .",
    "it was superseded by the map of @xcite , based on cobe and iras far - infrared and sub - mm maps .",
    "the latter map is now generally used , together with the galactic extinction law to correct extragalactic sources @xcite ; the inferred extinction along a line - of - sight is proportional to the reddening : @xmath4 .",
    "the canonical value of @xmath0 is 3.1 with occasionally lower values towards the galactic center @xcite and higher elsewhere @xcite .",
    "extinction by dust in intergalactic space ( 2 ) has been proposed as an alternative explanation for snia dimming , which is generally attributed to the cosmological acceleration @xcite .",
    "the resulting extinction law of this dust would effectively be grey because the attenuating dust would be spread over all redshifts along every line - of - sight .",
    "the coincidence of both uniform distribution in both sky and redshift space does give this explanation a somewhat contrived appearance .",
    "the injection of dust into the intergalactic medium would have to be constant and substantial .",
    "models of a dusty universe @xcite find this grey dust explanation increasingly inconsistent with observational data ( see also e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "extinction within the snia s host galaxy ( 3 ) , dust in the immediate surroundings and any disk , ring or spiral arm the line - of - sight passes through in projection , is an observationally evident , yet not fully constrained uncertainty .",
    "the dark energy task group report @xcite notes this as a primary source of uncertainty for snia measurements .",
    "three characteristics of the host galaxy s dust could and are expected to change over the history of the universe : ( a ) total dust content or mass , ( b ) dust distribution within the host galaxy and ( c ) dust composition .",
    "the overall effect on the effective extinction law is of interest for the distance determination from snia light curves .",
    "dust mass ( a ) is a variable in several spectral energy distribution ( sed ) studies of distant galaxies .",
    "@xcite modeled the overall dust content of galaxies over time and found that a maximum occurred either at z=1 or at z=3 .",
    "@xcite modeled the sed s from distant galaxies and similarly found a maximum dust content at z=1 .",
    "@xcite find a steady increase of dust mass with time from the uv - ir sed of galaxies .",
    "the typical dust mass found in distant galaxies is very much a function of the selected sample .",
    "far - infrared selected samples point to dust - rich galaxies , similar to arp 220 @xcite , optical / uv selected samples point to disks very similar to the local ones @xcite and lyman-@xmath5 galaxies point to low - extinction disks @xcite .",
    "however , more dust mass should not affect the snia distance determinations if the extinction law remains the same for nearby and distant galaxies .",
    "more dust in the distant galaxies will predominantly affect the observed snia _ rate _",
    "@xcite , as heavily obscured snia drop from observed samples .",
    "the dust distribution in host galaxies ( b ) is commonly modeled as a double exponential , one radial and one vertical , sometimes with rings to mimic spiral arms .",
    "the radial scale of the dust distribution is assumed to be similar to the stellar one and the vertical dust scale is supposed to be much smaller than the stellar one .",
    "previous observations of the scale - height in nearby ( edge - on ) galaxies appeared to corroborate the small scale - height ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but recent observations indicate a much higher scale - height for the dust @xcite , similar to the stellar scale .",
    "if the average scale - height of the dust distribution was higher in the past , then snia in the plane of the disk will encounter more extinction , especially when viewed in an inclined system .",
    "the different distribution has a similar effect as variation the dust content of galaxies and only the observed snia rate will be affected , unless dust composition and distribution are related .    the dust composition ( c ) , notably the ratio of small to large grains , directly affects the observed extinction law ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "evolution in the average extinction law is the most troubling possibility , as this would affect the extinction correction of snia and indirectly the measured hubble flow and acceleration . for local snia , variations in the extinction law",
    "have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite explained the different observed extinction law for some snia as the effect of circumstellar material around the snia progenitor .",
    "this is a plausible scenario as the massive - star supernovae are very efficient dust producers @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite report observations of such material .",
    "alternatively , there is substantial evidence for a link between star - formation and extinction law in star - forming galaxies ( see the review in * ? ? ? * and the references therein . ) .",
    "star - formation produces more small grains and the intense uv fields alter grain composition .    since it is not unreasonable to suppose that star - formation affects both the distribution and the extinction characteristic of dust in spiral disks , i propose a simple model for the evolution of the extinction law applicable to snia measurements .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore this link between the extinction law for snia and star - formation of host galaxies and to investigate how much extinction law evolution could reasonably influence snia distance measurements .",
    "the paper is organized in a brief review of current observations of evolution in host galaxy dust and @xmath0 (  2 ) , a description of the model (  3 ) , two tests based on current snia observations (  4 ) , and discussion and conclusions (  5 ) .",
    "observational evidence for a different extinction law at higher redshifts comes from lensed quasars , qso reddening by damped lyman-@xmath5 systems and grb afterglows , as well as snia measurements .",

    "given enough statistics , the snia measurements can then be used as probes of the distribution and severity of host galaxy extinction in disks at high redshift . in this paper",
    "i assumed that the distributions of reddening values are uniformly derived and the choice of prior in the lightcurve analysis did not matter . in future work",
