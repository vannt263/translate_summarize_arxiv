    "as core counts in modern supercomputers continue to grow , parallel algorithms are required that can provide concurrency beyond existing approaches parallelizing in space .",
    "in particular , algorithms that parallelize in time `` along the steps '' have attracted noticeable interest .",
    "probably the most widely studied algorithm of this type is parareal  @xcite , but other important methods exist as well , for example pita  @xcite or pfasst  @xcite .",
    "the applicability of parareal to the navier - stokes equations has been studied in  @xcite , where it is shown that parareal can solve the initial value problem arising from a finite element discretization of the navier - stokes equations for a reynolds number of 200 as well as from a spectral element discretization for a problem with reynolds number 7,500 .",
    "a non - newtonian problem is studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", parareal is combined with parallelization in space and setups with reynolds numbers up to 1,000 are investigated . while it is confirmed that parareal can successfully be applied to flow simulations , the attempt to demonstrate its potential to provide speedup beyond the saturation of the spatial parallelization was inconclusive , as either the pure time or pure space parallel approach provided minimum runtimes . a successful demonstration that parareal can speed up simulations",
    "after the spatial parallelization has saturated can be found in  @xcite , where parareal is used to simulate a driven cavity flow in a cube with a reynolds number of 1,000 .",
    "the performance of pfasst for a particle - based discretization of the navier - stokes equations on @xmath0 cores is studied in  @xcite .",
    "it has been noted in multiple works that parareal as well as pita have stability issues for convection - dominated problems , see  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that parareal will at some point cease to converge properly for the navier - stokes equations if the reynolds number increases and the problem becomes more and more dominated by advection .",
    "this paper discusses results from linear stability analysis and presents a numerical study for two - dimensional driven cavity flow of how the convergence of parareal is affected as viscosity decreases .",
    "parareal is a method to introduce concurrency in the solution of initial value problems @xmath1 it relies on the introduction of two classical one - step time integration methods , one computationally expensive and of high accuracy ( denoted by @xmath2 ) and one computationally cheap method of lower accuracy ( denoted by @xmath3 ) .",
    "the former is commonly referred to as the `` fine propagator '' , the latter as the `` coarse propagator '' .",
    "denote by @xmath4 the numerical approximation of the exact solution @xmath5 of   at some point in time @xmath6 .",
    "further , denote as @xmath7 the result obtained by integrating from an initial value @xmath4 given at a time @xmath8 forward in time to a time @xmath9 using a time - step @xmath10 and the method indicated by @xmath2 . for a decomposition of @xmath11 $ ] into @xmath12 so - called time - slices @xmath13 $ ] , @xmath14 , solving   time - slice after time - slice corresponds to classical time - marching , running the fine method in serial from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "instead , parareal approximately computes the values @xmath17 by means of the iteration @xmath18 were @xmath19 denotes the iteration counter . for @xmath20 ,",
    "iteration   converges towards the serial fine solution , that is @xmath21 .",
    "once values @xmath22 are known , the evaluation of the computationally expensive terms @xmath23 in   can be done in parallel on @xmath12 processors .",
    "then , a correction is propagated serially by evaluating the terms @xmath24 and computing @xmath25 .",
    "we refer to e.g.  @xcite for a more in - depth presentation of the algorithm .",
    "the speedup achievable by parareal concurrently computing the solution on @xmath12 time - intervals assigned to @xmath12 processors is bounded by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of iterations performed and @xmath28 , @xmath29 denote the time required to evaluate @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , see again e.g.  @xcite .",
    "note that the two bounds are competing in the sense that using a coarser and cheaper method for @xmath3 will usually improve the second bound but might cause parareal to require more iterations to converge , thereby reducing the first bound . in contrast , a more accurate and more expensive @xmath3 will likely reduce the iteration number but also reduce the coarse - to - fine runtime ratio @xmath32 .",
    "in order to illustrate parareal s stability properties , we apply it to the test equation @xmath33 a linear stability analysis of this kind was first done in  @xcite , using radauiia methods for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here , in line with the numerical examples presented in section  [ sec : results ] , the stability analysis is done for an implicit - explicit euler method for @xmath3 and an explicit runge - kutta-3 method for @xmath2 with five time steps of @xmath2 per two time steps of @xmath3 .",
    "the imex scheme treats the real part ( `` diffusion '' ) implicitly and the imaginary term ( `` convection '' ) explicitly .",
    "further , @xmath34 concurrent time slices are used and a time step @xmath35 for @xmath3 , so that @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ ruprecht_contrib_fig : stability ] shows the resulting stability domains and isolines of accuracy for the coarse method run serially ( a ) , the fine method run serially ( b ) , and for parareal with different numbers of iteration ( c)(f ) . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the solution from parareal is identical to the one provided by @xmath2 and thus the stability domains also coincide ( not shown ) . as can be expected because of the stability constraint arising from the explicitly treated imaginary term , the imex method used for @xmath3 becomes unstable if the imaginary part of @xmath38 becomes too dominant .",
    "parareal however ceases to be stable even before reaching the stability limit of the coarse propagator .",
    "the analysis confirms again that for problems with imaginary eigenvalues , parareal can develop instabilities although both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are stable .",
    "furthermore , the stability domain of parareal shrinks from @xmath39 to @xmath40 and @xmath41 before expanding again for @xmath42 .",
    "note also that for a fixed number of iterations , parareal becomes less accurate as @xmath43 increases ( in contrast to the serial fine method ) , corresponding to reduced rates of convergence .",
    "this means that achieving the accuracy of the underlying fine method will require more iterations for problems with larger imaginary eigenvalues , therefore reducing the speedup achievable by parareal , cf .",
    "the estimate  .",
    "eventually , as convergence becomes too slow , parareal will no longer be able to achieve speedup at all and will no longer be useful .",
    "the mathematical explanation for this behavior is a growing term in the error estimate for parareal for imaginary eigenvalues that is only compensated for as the iteration number approaches the number of time - slices , see the analysis in  @xcite .",
