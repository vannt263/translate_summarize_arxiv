    "in thermal field theory one is often interested in the `` hard thermal '' loop contributions , meaning those terms which come from a region where the loop momenta are of the order of the temperature @xmath3 , which is much larger than all external momenta .",
    "these green functions , which have a leading behavior at high temperature proportional to @xmath4 , where much studied in qcd @xcite .",
    "they are an important tool in _ re - summing _ the qcd thermal perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the hard thermal region is also relevant for the determination of the @xmath0 contributions ( unlike the terms linear in @xmath3 which come also from soft loop momenta ) .",
    "there have been several investigations of the @xmath0 terms associated with the 2-point functions @xcite , but the corresponding calculations done in connection with the 3-point functions have been thus far restricted to particular configurations of their external momenta @xcite .",
    "this work intends to study the hard thermal @xmath0 contributions associated with general _",
    "3-point green functions _ in thermal field theory . in order to discuss the logarithmic dependence",
    ", we use the analytically continued imaginary - time perturbation theory @xcite and relate these functions to _ forward scattering amplitudes _ @xcite . in section",
    "ii , we consider the 3-point function in the @xmath1 model in 6 dimensions , which has several similarities with the yang - mills theory and is useful to illustrate the main points in a simpler context . in section iii",
    "we study the hard thermal behavior of the 3-point function in the yang - mills theory .",
    "we focus on the @xmath5 terms , and find a lorentz invariant result having a @xmath3 dependence which is directly connected with the ultraviolet structure of the 3-point function at _ zero temperature_. this conclusion , obtained in the feynman gauge , is in fact true in any gauge .",
    "( we have explicitly verified this statement in a general class of covariant gauges .",
    "since this calculation requires a generalization of the method of forward scattering amplitudes , the corresponding analysis will be reported elsewhere . ) in general , the dependence upon @xmath3 for high @xmath3 is not necessarily related to the ultraviolet divergence of the zero temperature amplitude . in the yang - mills theory , for example , the leading behavior at high temperatures for all @xmath2-gluon functions is proportional to @xmath4 , although these functions are ultraviolet finite for @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the above connection between the @xmath5 contributions and the ultraviolet behavior at zero temperature , which emerged after a rather involved calculation , may seem at first somewhat surprising .",
    "for this reason we present in section iv a general argument concerning the @xmath0 behavior of @xmath2-point gluon green functions .",
    "this gives a simple explanation for the fact that the @xmath5 contributions always appear with the same coefficient as the residue of the ultraviolet pole part of the zero temperature amplitude .",
    "in order to exhibit the behavior of sub - leading hard thermal contributions in the simplest way , we consider the massless @xmath1 model in 6 dimensions which is asymptotically free . the feynman diagram associated with the thermal 3-point function",

    "such terms would give individually @xmath4 contributions , but these actually cancel by the eikonal identity @xmath15 the second term in ( [ eq23 ] ) is down by one power of @xmath16 and would lead to individual @xmath3 contributions , but such terms also cancel by symmetry under @xmath17 .",

    "( [ eq26 ] ) as @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes angular integration of the 5-dimensional unit vector @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we have evaluated the angular integral , using the approach discussed in reference @xcite . from the fact that the integrand is a dimensionless function of zero degree in the external momenta",
    ", one finds after some calculation that the angular integration just gives a factor of @xmath24 . in the integration over @xmath25 ,",
    "the lower limit must be chosen consistently with the range of validity of the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) . however , its value is immaterial for the determination of the @xmath0 contribution , which comes from the region of high internal momenta @xmath26 . evaluating these terms ,",
    "we then obtain for the logarithmic dependence on the temperature the simple lorentz invariant result @xmath27 this equation may be compared with the ultraviolet divergent contribution of the 3-point function at zero temperature , evaluated in @xmath28 dimensions : @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the renormalization scale .",
    "we see that the @xmath0 contribution has the same structure as the ultraviolet divergent part at zero temperature , so that it may be naturally combined with the @xmath31 term .",

    "it is known that the above connection between the @xmath5 contributions at high temperature and the ultraviolet pole part at zero temperature is also exhibited by the two point gluon function in the yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "if this property continues to hold for the 3-point gluon function , then , using the well known result for the corresponding zero temperature amplitude , we could immediately write for the @xmath5 contributions the following _ ansatz _ : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are color indices , @xmath34 are lorentz indices and @xmath35\\ ] ] is the basic three gluon vertex .",
    "equation ( [ eq31a ] ) was obtained replacing @xmath36 by @xmath37 in the @xmath38 ultraviolet divergent 3-gluon function , computed in the _ feynman gauge_. in what follows we will prove that this _ ansatz _ is indeed correct .    in the feynman",
    "gauge the _ pole structure _ of the gluon propagator is very similar to the scalar case considered in the previous section ; there are only _ simple poles_. this is a important ingredient which makes it possible to formulate the imaginary time formalism in terms of _ forward scattering amplitudes _",

    "[ fig2 ]    as in the scalar case , odd powers of @xmath41 will cancel when the @xmath17 terms are added . from the momentum dependence of the yang - mills vertices",

    "( [ eq31 ] ) we conclude that the terms of degree @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath40 will produce respectively the leading @xmath4 and the @xmath5 contributions .",

    "thus , the _ lorentz covariance _ of the logarithmic contributions is established .",
    "this remarkable property , which holds in spite of the fact that the angular integral is not a generally lorentz invariant process , was shown to be true in reference @xcite for _ any _ angular integrand which is a function of degree @xmath43 in @xmath47 .",
    "we also note that , by power counting , the @xmath5 contributions of _ any _ hard thermal @xmath2-point function will equally be a lorentz invariant quantity . in what follows we will use this property as an important tool for the explicit computation of the @xmath5 contributions .",
    "our simple _ ansatz _ given by eq .",
    "( [ eq31a ] ) is a very special case of the most general lorentz covariant expression . in general , for each set of color indices , there are 14 tensor structures which can be formed using 3 lorentz indices and the 2 independent four - momenta .",
    "however , the explicit calculation of the diagrams in fig .",
    "2 shows that the angular integrals in ( [ eq32 ] ) are such that the totally antisymmetric color factor @xmath51 _ factorizes _ and the result can be written as @xmath52 therefore , the lorentz covariant tensor @xmath53 must be _ antisymmetric _ under any interchange of a pair of momenta and the corresponding lorentz indices . a straightforward but quite involved calculation ( we have used the _ symbolic computer program _ maple )",
    "yields @xmath54 where the tensors @xmath55 are given in the appendix .",
    "we can perform the angular integrals for each individual term of these expressions in a straightforward way , using for instance the procedure of differentiation with respect to @xmath49 as described above . in practice",
    ", we found easier to use a decomposition in terms of a set of tensors @xcite built from the basic tensors    @xmath56    the _ complete _ set is generated from the above equations including new tensors obtained from @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and from @xmath59 , @xmath60 , by cyclic permutations of @xmath61 .",
    "this gives a total of 16 tensors in terms of which we write the most general expression for @xmath53 .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion can be obtained in a straightforward way by simply solving a system of 16 equations .",
    "these equations are obtained using the expressions in the appendix and performing the lorentz indices contractions with each of the 16 tensors .",
    "the solution of this system will be , in general , scalar functions of @xmath62 involving angular integrals which can always be reduced to eq .",
    "( [ eq33 ] ) , or the special case of it when @xmath63 , when one uses the momentum conservation @xmath64 . in principle",
    "these scalars could have any kind of dependence on the external momenta involving eq .",
    "( [ eq33 ] ) and rational functions .",
    "however , the explicit calculation shows that , after using the eikonal identity given by eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) , all coefficients vanish , except for the coefficients of @xmath65 and its cyclic permutations which simplify to give just @xmath66 . inserting these terms into eq ( [ eq34 ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) , we finally obtain the result stated in eq .",
    "( [ eq31a ] ) .",
    "to get a further understanding of the connection between the @xmath5 contributions and the ultraviolet behavior of the green functions at zero temperature , let us consider the complete thermal amplitude , which includes the zero temperature part .",
    "this can be written , for instance in the yang - mills case where we omit for simplicity the color indices , as follows @xcite : @xmath67 here @xmath30 is the renormalization scale , @xmath68 are integers and @xmath69 runs over all integers . for fixed @xmath69 ,",
    "the @xmath70 integral is ultraviolet finite , having no poles at @xmath71 .    in order to determine those terms which can yield an ultraviolet pole when the summation over @xmath69 is evaluated ,",
    "let us examine a relevant contribution which is obtained after the @xmath70 integration has been performed .",
    "making appropriate shifts in @xmath72 , one finds that such a term is proportional to a sum of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 are constants and @xmath76 is some linear combination of the external energies with integral coefficients .",
    "@xmath77 is some linear combination of the external momenta which may be neglected in the high temperature limit , except when @xmath78 vanishes .",
    "we now set @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is some integer and consider the contributions to @xmath81 from the regions @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "it turns out that the pole part arises from the summation over the domain where @xmath84 , i. e. , when @xmath85 . expanding in this region ( [ eq42 ] ) in powers of @xmath86",
    ", we find that the leading term gives a contribution involving the _ zeta function _",
    "@xmath87 , which is defined in general as @xcite @xmath88 this function is analytic for all values of @xmath89 , except near the point @xmath90 , where it has a simple pole @xmath91 .",
    "at this stage , having performed the summation over the discrete frequencies @xmath92 , we can analytically continue the external energies to continuous values of @xmath76 . identifying in the complete thermal amplitude all contributions which yield poles at @xmath71 , and",
    "using the fact that the leading term in @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath93 , one obtains an expression of the form : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the residue of the ultraviolet divergent part of the green function at zero temperature .",
    "this has the same structure , because of the renormalizability of the the theory , as the corresponding basic function appearing in the yang - mills lagrangian .",
    "the above equation shows that for general green functions , the @xmath5 contributions have the same form as the ultraviolet divergent terms which occur at zero temperature and combine in a simple way with the @xmath96 terms .",
    "in particular , if the green function at zero temperature is ultraviolet convergent , the residue @xmath95 must vanish and the @xmath5 term should be absent at high temperature .",
    "this has been explicitly verified in the case of the electron - positron box diagram in thermal qed @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "we mention that the above property allows us to include in a simple way the @xmath0 contributions into the _ running coupling constant _ @xmath97 at high temperature . several investigations on this important topic @xcite have exposed ambiguities which are related , at least in part , to the fact that the thermal contributions to @xmath97 are not generally lorentz invariant functions . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 terms are lorentz invariant , being directly related to the ultraviolet behavior of the green functions at zero temperature .",
    "it is well known that the effective coupling @xmath98 at zero temperature , where @xmath99 is a typical external momentum , involves a logarithmic dependence of the form @xmath100 . the @xmath99 dependence in this term",
    "must be canceled by a corresponding dependence in the @xmath101 term at high temperature , since the complete thermal amplitude contains only a combination of the form @xmath102 .",
    "we thus obtain a gauge and lorentz invariant quantity @xmath103 which is relevant , for example , in the calculation of the pressure in thermal field theories @xcite .",
