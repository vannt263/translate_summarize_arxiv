    "since we are dealing with single - channel conduction , the conductance is related to the transmission probability @xmath18 by the landauer formula@xcite @xmath19 the problem of the distribution of the thermopower is therefore a problem of the distribution of the logarithmic derivative of the transmission probability .",

    "the times @xmath93 are the eigenvalues of the wigner - smith time - delay matrix ( see refs .   and ) .",

    "multi - channel diffusive conductors were studied in ref .  .",
    "for a chaotic cavity with ballistic point contacts having a large number of modes ( @xmath100 modes per point contact ) , the distribution of the thermopower is gaussian .",
    "the mean is zero and the variance is @xmath101 ( we have used the results of ref .  .",
    ") analogously to universal conductance fluctuations , the variance of the thermopower is reduced by a factor of @xmath39 upon breaking time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath102 ) .    for an @xmath100-mode wire in the localized regime ,",
    "our derivation of the exponential distribution of the thermopower remains valid .",
    "this is not true for the lorentzian distribution .",
    "the reason is that the herbert - jones - thouless formula for @xmath103 relates the density of states to the sum of the inverse localization lengths , @xcite and there is no simple relation between this sum and the thermopower .",
    "we expect that the tail of the distribution remains quadratic , @xmath104  because of the argument of sec .",
