    "in the study of both atomic and optical physics problems , often analyzed in the realm of nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type equations  @xcite , the study of double well potentials has a prominent position .",
    "such potentials can be straightforwardly realized in atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) through the combination of a parabolic ( harmonic ) trap with a periodic potential .",
    "their experimental realization and subsequent study in becs with self - repulsive nonlinearity has led to numerous interesting observations including tunneling and josephson oscillations for small numbers of atoms in the condensate , and macroscopic quantum self - trapped states for large atom number  @xcite and symmetry - breaking dynamical instabilities  @xcite .",
    "these experimental developments have been accompanied by a larger array of theoretical studies on issues such as finite - mode reductions and symmetry - breaking bifurcations @xcite , quantum effects @xcite , and nonlinear variants of the potentials @xcite .",
    "similar features have also emerged in nonlinear optical settings including the formation of asymmetric states in dual - core fibers @xcite , self - guided laser beams in kerr media @xcite , and optically - induced dual - core waveguiding structures in photorefractive crystals @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "a theme that has also been progressively becoming of increasing importance within both of these areas of physics is that of long range interactions . in the atomic context ,",
    "the experimental realization of becs of magnetically polarized @xmath0cr atoms @xcite ( see recent review @xcite and for a study of double well effects  @xcite ) , as well as the study of dipolar molecules hetmol , and atoms in which electric moments are induced by a strong external field @xcite have been at the center of the effort to appreciate the role of long range effects . on the other hand , in nonlinear optics , where nonlocal effects have been argued to be relevant for some time now  @xcite ,",
    "numerous striking predictions and observations have arisen in the setting of thermal nonlocal media  @xcite . among them",
    ", we single out the existence of stable vortex rings  @xcite the experimental realization of elliptically shaped spatial solitons  @xcite and the observation of potentially pairwise attracting ( instead of repelling as in the standard local cubic media ) dark solitons  @xcite .",
    "another very important large class of systems displaying a nonlocal nonlinearity consists of materials with a quadratic nonlinearity . in  @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that , in fact , the quadratic nonlinearity is inherently nonlocal .",
    "this implies that nonlocality can be used explain the beautiful x - wave  @xcite observations and even the different regimes of soliton pulse compression in quadratic materials  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in these quadratic media , not only does the prototypical ingredient of ( effective ) nonlocality arise , but it is also possible for a competition of this feature with the cubic nonlinearity to emerge as is discussed in  @xcite .    our aim in the present work is to expand on the framework of studies of double well potentials in the presence of nonlocal nonlinear interactions by considering cubic - quintic models .",
    "part of the motivation for doing so consists of the fundamental relevance of the cubic - quintic nls .",
    "the latter is a model that has been used in a variety of physical settings .",
    "these include the light propagation in optical media such as non - kerr crystals @xcite , chalcogenide glasses @xcite , organic materials @xcite , colloids @xcite , dye solutions @xcite , and ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "it has also been predicted that this type of nonlinearity may be synthesized by means of a cascading mechanism @xcite .",
    "an additional part of the motivation stems from an interesting set of observations that were made in an earlier work featuring competing _",
    "nonlinearities , one of which was a cubic local and another was a cubic nonlocal one ; see  @xcite and the discussion therein . in that work , it was found that for repulsive nonlocal cubic interactions and attractive local ones , it was possible to tune the prefactors determining the competition so as to produce not only a symmetry breaking , but also a symmetry - restoring bifurcation .",
    "more recently , a similar conclusion in a local cubic - quintic double well potential was reached in  @xcite .    here",
    ", we present a framework where the competition of cubic and quintic terms can be systematically quantified .",
    "in addition , to address the problem from a broader perspective , we consider fully nonlocal interactions both for the cubic and the quintic terms , rendering the local case a straightforward special - case scenario of our study .",
    "the specific setup we consider here is partially of interest to the field of cold gases e.g. in the case of repulsive quintic ( but local ) interactions and attractive cubic nonlocal ones .",
    "this exactly corresponds to the model of the dipolar tonks - girardeau gas with the dipole moments polarized along the axis , considered earlier in  @xcite .",
    "the difference here is that in this setting the quintic interaction can not be made nonlocal ( although the relevant mathematical norm form description and physical phenomenology will be essentially the same as presented herein ) .",
    "a setup more precisely in tune with the considerations given below arises in the field of nonlinear optics and , more particularly , in the case of thermal optical nonlinearity  @xcite but when the heating is provided by the resonant absorption by dopants , in which case the absorption may be saturable . in the appendix",
    ", we justify more precisely this connection to the specific model analyzed in what follows .",
    "we start our presentation of the theoretical analysis of section ii by developing a two - mode reduction of the system with both the cubic and the quintic terms .",
    "we systematically examine all the relevant terms and offer a prescription for assessing the dominant contributions to the resulting dynamics of the left and the right well . following an amplitude - phase decomposition and examining the variables associated with the population imbalance of the two wells , and their relative phase , we construct the hamiltonian normal form of the two - mode reduction of the cubic - quintic double well system .",
    "we then _ explicitly illustrate _ how the bifurcation analysis of this normal form encapsulates not only the symmetry breaking but _ also _ the symmetry restoring .",
    "we argue that this cubic - quintic realization is the prototypical one where both of these effects can be observed and analytically quantified .",
    "subsequently , in section iii , we proceed to test the relevant predictions by means of a computational bifurcation analysis , as well as through direct numerical simulations ( in order to monitor the predicted dynamical instabilities ) .",
    "we find very good agreement with the symmetry breaking predictions of the model and even a quite fair agreement with the symmetry restoring ones ( which arise in a highly nonlinear regime and are hence less amenable to a two - mode analysis ) .",
    "we also quantify the disparity of the analytical predictions and numerical results for large values of the nonlocality range parameter .",
    "finally , section iv contains our conclusions and some directions for future study .",
    "as indicated above , our fundamental model will be the 1d nls equation in the presence of two nonlocal terms , namely the cubic and quintic ones : @xmath1 with @xmath2 and the linear operator will be of the standard schrdinger type @xmath3 this encompasses the double - well potential of the form : @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the normalized strength of the parabolic trap and it is @xmath6 in a quasi-1d situation in becs ( here the effective trap frequency is the ratio of the longitudinal trap strength along the condensate over the one of the tightly confined transverse directions ) . in our study",
    "we consider a typical experimentally relevant value of @xmath7 , while the generally tunable ( see e.g.  @xcite ) parameters of the laser beam forming the light defect are chosen to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( which we have found to be fairly typical values representative of the phenomenology to be analyzed below ) .    for the kernels @xmath10 , @xmath11 we will focus our considerations on either the gaussian @xmath12 or the exponential @xmath13 while the latter is more specifically relevant to the thermal nonlocal ( optical ) media and to quadratic nonlinear materials  @xcite",
    ", we also use the former due to the mathematical simplicity of its kernel . in any event",
    ", our results will not be significantly different qualitatively between the two cases , although obviously the quantitative details will not be the same .",
    "the key parameter here is the range of the nonlocal interaction parametrized by @xmath14 .",
    "notice that both kernels in the limit of @xmath15 tend to a genuinely local interaction ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) .",
    "we now develop the two - mode approximation in order to obtain a decomposition ( or more accurately a galerkin truncation ) of the solution @xmath17 over the minimal basis of fundamental states .",
    "more specifically , we use an orthonormal basis composed by the wave functions @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig . 1 ) are the ground state and the first excited state , respectively , corresponding to the first two eigenvalues of @xmath21 that are @xmath22 and @xmath23 for our choice of potential parameters above . notice that these two eigenfunctions represent modes with support predominantly on the left and right well , respectively .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath24 and the rotated basis employed herein of @xmath25 are both shown in fig .  [ basis ] .",
    "the two - mode approximation is then defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are complex time - dependent amplitudes and the approximation consists of the truncation of the higher modes within the expansion . before substituting into the initial gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation",
    ", we notice that the action of the linear operator @xmath21 on our basis elements is as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are linear combinations of the two eigevalues of @xmath21 respectively to the solutions @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "subsequently , substitution of our ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ twomode ] ) in the full nonlinear problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) yields : @xmath32\\int r(x - x')\\phi_l(x')\\phi_r(x')dx'\\\\ + \\delta|c_l|^4(c_l\\phi_l + c_r\\phi_r)\\int r_2(x - x')\\phi_l^4(x')dx ' + \\delta|c_r|^4(c_l\\phi_l + c_r\\phi_r)\\int r_2(x - x')\\phi_r^4(x')dx'\\\\ + \\delta\\left[(4|c_l|^4|c_r|^4c_l + c_l^3{c_r^*}^2 + c_l^*|c_l|^2c_r^2)\\phi_l + ( 4|c_l|^4|c_r|^4c_r + c_r^3{c_l^*}^2 + c_r^*|c_r|^2c_l^2)\\phi_r \\right ] \\cdot\\\\ \\cdot \\int r_2(x - x')\\phi_l^2(x')\\phi_r^2(x')dx'\\\\ + 2\\delta\\left[(|c_l|^2c_l^2c_r^ * + |c_l|^4c_r)\\phi_l +    ( |c_l|^2|c_r|^2c_l + |c_l|^2c_r^2c_l^*)\\phi_r\\right]\\int r_2(x - x')\\phi_l^3(x')\\phi_r(x')dx'\\\\ + 2\\delta\\left[(c_l^2|c_r|^2c_r^",

    "this involves the following integrals which will play a fundamental role in our considerations below : @xmath33 from the first nonlocal term , as well as @xmath34 from the second nonlocal term .",
    "some alternatives that are derived if we interchange the variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 or swap @xmath37 and @xmath38 can also be equivalently considered .",
    "a numerical study of the first four intergrals was already conducted in  @xcite , where it was found that typically the integrals @xmath39 can be considered as negligible in comparison to @xmath40 which is the dominant term . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath41 is close to @xmath39 for near - local interactions ( i.e. , for small values of @xmath14 ) , but becomes comparable to @xmath40 as the latter descreases for wide nonlocal interaction ranges ( i.e. , for large @xmath14 ) .",
    "the criterion that we use to determine whether @xmath41 is negligible or not was @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "this yields that @xmath41 remains significant until ( i.e. , down to ) a critical value @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the gaussian and exponential kernels , respectively .",
    "the dependence of the relevant overlap integrals on the range of the interaction @xmath14 is shown in fig .",
    "[ overlap_int ] .    taking into regard the second nonlocal term ( which for simplicity we have assumed to share the same range parameter as the first )",
    ", we can see from fig .",
    "[ overlap_int2 ] that the integrals @xmath46 are always negligible but @xmath47 appears to be a nontrivial competing term .",
    "this is to a certain degree intuitively anticipated , as this represents the dominant term associated with the quintic interaction .",
    "adapting the same criterion as in  @xcite ( namely @xmath48 ) , we incorporate the relevant @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 for the gaussian and exponential kernel , respectively . according to this",
    "we may distinguish three cases :    * the terms @xmath40 and @xmath49 are considered for @xmath52 ( for the gaussian kernel ) ; * the term with prefactor @xmath41 is added when @xmath53 .",
    "* for @xmath54 , @xmath49 is omitted and only @xmath40 , @xmath41 are taken into account .",
    "for the first case , the projection of the equation onto the states @xmath25 yields @xmath55 and by introducing madelung representation of action - angle or amplitude - phase decomposition ( @xmath56 ) , we obtain @xmath57 where we have defined the relative phase @xmath58 and the respective equations for @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be obtained by exchanging @xmath37 and @xmath38 and using @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 .",
    "focusing now on the steady solutions ( satisfying @xmath63 ) , we need to enforce @xmath64 or @xmath65 for non - zero amplitudes .",
    "this leads us to symmetric and antisymmetric ( equal or opposite amplitudes ) _ pairs _ of solutions , namely for @xmath66 we have the symmetric ( only positive ones among the ) solutions @xmath67 with @xmath68 , for @xmath69 ( @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) .",
    "also , for @xmath72 , we have ( only the positive amplitude ones among ) the antisymmetric solutions @xmath73 with @xmath74 for @xmath69 ( resp .",
    "@xmath75 for @xmath76 ) . for the asymmetric solutions one has to solve the polynomial @xmath77 which can more conveniently be written as a function of the norm of the solutions ( representing the atom number in becs and the optical intensity in optics ) .",
    "thus , introducing @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) yields the quartic polynomial @xmath80 for the second case ( @xmath81 ) the integrals @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath49 are taken into account and the projection equations onto the states @xmath25 , read : @xmath82 here , the amplitude - phase decomposition yields @xmath83 we can , once again , obtain the set of stationary solutions as follows . when @xmath66 ( symmetric case ) the solutions will be ( the positive amplitude ones among ) @xmath84 for @xmath85 for @xmath69 ( @xmath86 for @xmath87 ) and when @xmath88 ( antisymmetric case ) the solutions are ( the positive amplitude ones among ) @xmath89 and exist for @xmath90 for @xmath69 ( @xmath91 for @xmath87 ) .",
    "the asymmetric solutions now , directly in norm expression , will be given by the polynomial @xmath92 with @xmath93 here standing for @xmath94 .",
    "in the third case , when @xmath54 , the effect of the quintic terms is deemed to be negligible and the situation reverts to the analysis of  @xcite and is hence omitted here .      in order to derive a more convenient form of the system so that we can proceed to the analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) bifurcation , we introduce the population imbalance between the two wells , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "together with the relative phase between the two wells @xmath58 , this forms a set of conjugate variables , in which we obtain the dynamical system : @xmath98 this can be written in the hamiltonian form @xmath99 with the hamiltonian function @xmath100 note that @xmath93 stands either for @xmath40 ( @xmath101 ) or for @xmath94 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the system possesses the stationary solutions ( critical points ) @xmath103 and @xmath104 with @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 that correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions , identified above .",
    "furthermore , the stationary solutions representing the asymmetric branches are given by : @xmath108 these branches emerge and merge as bifurcations from and to the symmetric or antisymmetric solutions and they exist for those values of @xmath78 for which @xmath109 .",
    "taking @xmath110 , we get that @xmath111 by substituting @xmath112 or @xmath113 we get the same four possible expressions for @xmath78 as a function of @xmath14 that are displayed in fig.@xmath114 and we denote them with @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( the subscripts @xmath119 and @xmath120 correspond to the ( - ) signs in the left and right expressions of eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) , respectively , while the subscripts @xmath121 and @xmath122 to the ( + ) signs ) .",
    "one can then see that when @xmath112 and demanding that @xmath123 , one gets that @xmath78 should either lie in the area outside the curves @xmath115 and @xmath116 or in the area inside the curves @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in the case of @xmath124 and @xmath71 ,",
    "the role of the symmetric and anti - symmetric branches gets exchanged in as far as the bifurcation of the asymmetric branch is concerned ( see also below ) .",
    "importantly , it can be observed in fig .  [ crit_points ]",
    "that @xmath115 is always negative , hence it is omitted for the principal case considered herein , namely @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "on the one hand , the _",
    "critical _ conclusion of our analysis is that for @xmath127 , the system is predicted to have for the anti - symmetric branch both a symmetry breaking bifurcation ( at @xmath128 ) and a symmetry restoring one that eliminates the asymmetric branch ( at @xmath129 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the right panel suggests that @xmath117 , @xmath118 coincide @xmath130 , beyond which there is only a single ( symmetry breaking ) bifurcation .",
    "however , as will be discussed below , for large interaction range @xmath14 this prediction seems to have some discrepancy from what actually happens as we will see that in fact , we observe a symmetry restoring bifurcation while we do not observe a bifurcation at all in the symmetric branch . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this is the first example of an analytical prediction of the existence of a symmetry restoring bifurcation , a feature that is unique to the analysis of the normal form of the bifurcation for the cubic - quintic case ( and can not be predicted e.g. in the purely cubic case two - mode analysis of  @xcite ) .",
    "the new critical points appear or disappear as a pitchfork bifurcation that emerges from the antisymmetric solutions for @xmath88 respectively . from the symmetric solution , in this case of @xmath125 and @xmath126 ,",
    "only a single bifurcation arises at @xmath131 .    for the opposite case ( to the one principally considered herein ) of @xmath124 and @xmath71 ,",
    "i.e. , for a focusing cubic nonlinearity , the bifurcations emerge from the symmetric branch , while for @xmath125 , i.e. , for a defocusing cubic term , then the relevant symmetry breakings arose from the anti - symmetric branch .",
    "thus , in this case , we expect an asymmetric branch to bifurcate and break the symmetry at @xmath128 , while it returns to the parent symmetric branch restoring the symmetry at @xmath132 . on the other hand , for the anti - symmetric waveform with a focusing cubic nonlinearity ,",
    "only a single bifurcation arises at @xmath133 .",
    "we provide further details of each of these bifurcations and their comparison with the full numerics of the underlying nls model in the next section .    from the system of eqs .",
    "( [ system ] ) , one can reduce the dynamical evolution to a single second - order ode : @xmath134 which can also be rewritten in the `` position - momentum '' variables as : @xmath135 this renders the system amenable to the phase plane representation of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_plane ] . here",
    "we observe that there is a stationary solution @xmath136 which is a fixed point of the center type .",
    "however , for the cases when @xmath112 , for @xmath78 crossing the critical point @xmath116 in the case of the symmetric branch and for @xmath137 $ ] in the case of the anti - symmetric branch , there appear two more critical points at @xmath138 and @xmath139 , representing the asymmetric solutions . the point @xmath140 is a fixed point of center type before the bifurcation occurs , but past the relevant critical number of atoms ( or optical intensity ) , it becomes a saddle as the two new ( asymmetric ) fixed points that appear are of center type .",
    "[ phase_plane ] shows the phase space of the full system , as well as the vicinity of the critical points for the gaussian kernel with @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that there are no further changes in the stability of the critical points ( and thus in the corresponding stationary solutions ) for other values of @xmath78 except for those reported above . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we illustrate this below for the antisymmetric solution bifurcation as a preamble towards the corresponding numerical results of the next section .",
    "the antisymmetric solution corresponds the critical point @xmath144 where the jacobian of the linearized version of ( [ system ] ) is @xmath145 and its eigenvalues satisfy @xmath146 for the case where @xmath147 the graph of @xmath148 versus @xmath78 ( illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ eigen ] ) shows clearly that the two initially ( i.e. , close to the linear limit ) purely imaginary eigenvalues become real at @xmath149 , so that the center type equilibrium becomes a saddle until @xmath150 where it turns back to its initial state , restoring the stability on the antisymmetric branch ( symmetry - restoring bifurcation ) with no other changes in between ( or after that ) . for the asymmetric solution that corresponds to the point @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath88 , the jacobian becomes @xmath153 and for its eigenvalues we obtain @xmath154 again for @xmath147 the graph of @xmath148 versus @xmath78 ( illustrated in the right panel of fig .  [ eigen ] ) shows that the eigenvalues are always purely imaginary which corresponds to an equilibrium of the center type .",
    "one can observe here that the values of @xmath78 where the eigenvalues of the asymmetric branch  touch \" the @xmath35-axis ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) coincide with the values where the bifurcation occurs ( fig .  [ crit_points]-right panel )",
    "therefore the critical points @xmath157 cease to exist before @xmath158 and after @xmath159 . for the values of @xmath78 within this interval ,",
    "no further change of stability is observed .",
    "as it is made clear in the next section , these stability results are in excellent agreement with the corresponding numerical ones .",
    "additionally , it will be come transparent therein that additional turning points in the @xmath78 vs. @xmath160 bifurcation diagram do _ not _ correspond to any instabilities in complete agreement with the recent analysis of  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the examination of our analysis against the results of numerical bifurcation analysis ( and in the next subsection also compare them to direct numerical simulations ) .",
    "we focus here on the case where @xmath125 , @xmath69 , as we are especially interested in the case of _ competing _ interactions ; we will briefly also touch upon the case of @xmath124 and @xmath71 . in our numerical computations ,",
    "the stationary solutions are obtained by using a fixed - point newton - raphson iteration for a finite difference decomposition of the relevant boundary value problem , with a choice of the grid spacing of @xmath161 and employing a parametric ( and wherever needed a pseudo - arclength ) continuation of the solutions with respect to the chemical potential parameter @xmath160 ( in optics this is the so - called propagation constant ) .",

    "instability is guaranteed by the existence of any eigenvalues @xmath168 of the linearized operator with @xmath169 in the sense that perturbations along the corresponding eigendirections will deviate exponentially from the corresponding fixed point .",
    "recall that this is also the case for all eigenvalues of our hamiltonian system , since when @xmath168 is an eigenvalue , so are @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 . in the case where all eigenvalues are found to be purely imaginary ,",
    "then the solution is found to be marginally stable .    in our specific case of competing interactions ,",
    "we comment on the following .",
    "the positive value ( @xmath173 ) denotes the repulsive behavior of the cubic nonlocal term while the negative one @xmath69 leads to attractive behavior of the quintic nonlocal nonlinearity .",
    "as we examine the bifurcation problem of nonlinear states from the corresponding linear eigenstates , we expect that for lower values of @xmath78 ( i.e. , weaker nonlinearities ) , the former repulsive term should be dominant , while for larger values of @xmath78 ( i.e. , stronger nonlinearities ) , it is anticipated that the latter attractive term will take over .",
    "this is accurately reflected in the numerical bifurcation diagrams that we now show in figs .",
    "[ stat1]-[stat3 ] , for three ( distinct by roughly an order of magnitude in each case ) values of the range @xmath14 . the first value of @xmath174 in fig .  [ stat1 ]",
    "is supposed to reflect the local case ( since the range of interaction is much smaller than any other intrinsic length scale in the system ) . here",
    "the agreement with the two - mode approximation is very good quantitatively for low @xmath78 and very good qualitatively ( and even good quantitatively for some features such as chemical potentials of critical points ) for large @xmath78 .",
    "the quality of these types of agreements is found to be preserved for an intermediate interaction range of @xmath141 in fig .",
    "[ stat2 ] .",
    "however , when the interaction range becomes sufficiently large that it competes ( or overcomes ) the length scale of the potential wells , then fundamental disparities are expected to be found and that is the very conclusion of fig .",

    "the rightward bending of the branches for small @xmath78 confirms the dominance of the self - repulsive part of the ( cubic ) interactions for small @xmath78 , as indicated above .",
    "the antisymmetric branch ( top right panel of fig .",
    "[ stat1 ] and see also the zoom of the bottom panel of the figure ) is destabilized and the theoretically predicted asymmetric branch emerges .",

    "two additional observations should be made here .",
    "on the one hand , since the symmetry restoring occurs at much larger values of @xmath78 , the relevant agreement is expected to be less adequate quantitatively than for the symmetry breaking occurring at lower @xmath78 .",

    ", it can indeed be observed that while the overall trend of the two curves is the same ( and even critical / turning points in terms of their chemical potential are rather accurately captured ) , this agreement is not adequate quantitatively e.g. for critical values of @xmath78 ( or for detailed quantitative matching of the curves for large @xmath78 ) .",
    "for the symmetric solution of the top left panel of fig .",

    "the critical point for the emergence of the asymmetric branch is predicted for @xmath186 in reasonable agreement with the full numerical result . for the case of @xmath187",
    "the effects are similar to those in the previous case .",
    "the symmetry breaking of the antisymmetric branch ( top right , as well as zoom in of the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ stat2 ] ) occurs now at @xmath188 according to the numerical results and at @xmath189 in the two - mode approximation , again attesting to its validity for small @xmath78 . after following a similar trajectory with the case @xmath147",
    ", the asymmetric solution merges back to the antisymmetric one at @xmath190 ( numerical value ) or at @xmath191 ( analytical value ) with the antisymmetric branch again regaining its stability past the symmetry restoring bifurcation .",
    "the symmetric solution ( top left panel of fig .  [ stat2 ] ) again increases monotonically until it sustains a symmetry breaking bifurcation of its own at @xmath192 .",
    "the two - mode approximation predicts this bifurcation to arise at @xmath193 .",
    "+    next , in fig .",
    "[ stat3 ] , we increase the interaction range , roughly , another order of magnitude by setting @xmath194 . here , as may be intuitively expected given that the interaction range is wider than the wells of the potential , the results are quite different .",
    "for small values of @xmath160 ( and thus atom number @xmath78 or optical power ) we have a quite satisfactory agreement ( even quantititative ) with the two mode approximation , as may be expected . as a demonstration of that ,",
    "we note that the symmetry breaking of the antisymmetric branch occurs in our analysis at @xmath195 , while numerically it is found to take place at @xmath196 . on the other hand , due to the predicted earlier collision of the critical points @xmath117 and @xmath118",
    ", there is no symmetry restoring taking place in our normal form reduction .",
    "nevertheless , we observe that such a restoring , in fact , still takes place in the full numerical bifurcation diagram .",
    "furthermore , in this case , we have not been able to detect a symmetry - breaking bifurcation in the case of the symmetric branch , even though such a bifurcation is predicted within the reduction .",
    "this illustrates that for such large values of @xmath14 , even the qualitative agreement previously associated with the large @xmath78 case dynamics should not be expected to be present .    finally ,",
    "we examine also one case where we switch the signs of the nonlocal terms to @xmath197 , so now the cubic term is the one that behaves attractively while the quintic one behaves repulsively .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ stat3a ] .",
    "the interaction range @xmath14 is selected here to be @xmath121 and here we see that the same phenomenology appears in a region where the cheminal potential varies from @xmath198 to @xmath199 , thus attaining negative values . as earlier ,",
    "both states emanate for the same values of @xmath160 and as we decrease its value we observe the symmetry breaking at @xmath200 ( both for numerical and analytical ) this time on the symmetric state which becomes unstable . as we further decrease the chemical potential to negative values of @xmath160 , the symmetry restoring of the asymmetric state towards its parent symmetric branch occurs at @xmath201 ( numerical value ) .",
    "the analytical prediction for this critical point is @xmath202 .",
    "hence , once again we observe a good qualitative agreement for larger @xmath78 ( although once again slight quantitative disparities exist between the overall curves and the critical points in terms of @xmath78 ) .",
    "a look at the antisymmetric branch now shows us that a bifurcation occurs at the point where the solution changes slope ( @xmath182 ) , precisely at @xmath203 ( numerical ) and is theoretically predicted to arise at @xmath204 ( analytical ) with the antisymmetric branch becoming unstable past this critical point .",
    "once again the zoom of the bottom panel confirms the quantitative nature of the analytical - numerical agreement for small values of @xmath78 , which retains its qualitative value even for larger @xmath78 .",
    "+     +      finally , we briefly turn to the dynamics of the system , in order to observe the implications of the dynamical instability due to the symmetry breaking .",
    "the relevant evolution of the unstable solutions for @xmath205 and @xmath206 , in the case of @xmath141 ( recall that @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ evolution ] . in both cases",
    ", it can be seen that the weak perturbation added on top of the exact numerical solution in the initial conditions has a projection along the unstable eigenmode .",
    "this projection , for sufficiently long times ( about @xmath207 in the left panel and about @xmath208 in the right panel ) , gets amplified and eventually leads to a visible ( i.e. , of order unity ) symmetry breaking in the profile of the state . while the space - time evolution of the density ( in the atomic case ; optical intensity in the optical case ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ evolution ] , an interesting alternative way to visualize the instability was proposed recently by  @xcite . in the latter work ,",
    "the pde dynamics was , in fact , projected to the phase plane of the two - mode approximation and visualized therein .",
    "an example of such a visualization for the case of @xmath205 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pde_phase_plane ] . from",
    "both the phase plane curves and the profiles illustrated underneath of the solution at different times , we can extract some interesting conclusions .",
    "in particular , in the one degree of freedom reduction of our theoretical analysis , the trajectory occurs over iso - contours of the energy .",
    "hence , the kind of phase plane picture shown in fig .  [ pde_phase_plane ] would only be possible by `` conglomerating '' many distinct orbits .",
    "however , it is important to appreciate that the pde has infinitely many degrees of freedom . in that capacity",
    ", it is possible for the `` subspace '' of our two - mode approximation to _ dissipate _ energy towards ( or possibly regain energy from ) higher energy states ( of the point spectrum of the system ) . in so doing",
    ", it appears as if the system visits further and further inward trajectories of lower energy , because indeed the excess energy has been imparted to other degrees of freedom .",
    "this yields a clear illustration of how the subspace of our two - modes is a _ closed system _ for the ode reduction , but instead is an _",
    "open system _ for the full pde evolutionary dynamics  .",
    "in the present work , we examined double well potentials in the presence of nonlocal interactions both in the cubic and in the quintic part of the nonlinearity .",
    "we attempted to address such settings by means of a two - mode decomposition that has the notable advantage that nonlocality is not substantially different to handle therein , as the nonlocal kernels merely contribute to relevant overlap integrals that need some systematic book - keeping , but are otherwise not considerably harder than is the locally nonlinear case .",
    "there are some particularly important attributes of the quintic case that we were able to extract via a normal form reduction and phase plane visualization ( under suitable circumstances of `` competition '' e.g. for a defocusing cubic but focusing quintic nonlinearity ) .",
    "one such is that contrary to the purely cubic case , the reduction is able to predict not only a symmetry breaking bifurcation , but _ also _ a symmetry restoring one ( at least for a suitable interval of range parameters for the interaction kernel ) .",
    "another unusual characteristic is that symmetry breaking bifurcations are encountered _ both _ for the symmetric and the antisymmetric branch , again differently than is the case for the cubic nonlinearity in the double well setting .",
    "these features were tested against numerical bifurcation results and good agreement was found where appropriate ( e.g. low atom numbers and a suitable range of the interaction range ) . disparities arising for high @xmath78 and large @xmath14",
    "were systematically explained . finally , the instability dynamics was visualized not only by space - time density evolution plots but also by offering its projection to the phase plane of the double well theoretical reduction and assessing the similarities and differences therein of the ode approximation and full pde result .",
    "there are numerous possibilities for the extension of the present results to more elaborate contexts . on the one hand , even in the one - dimensional setting",
    ", one could envision a study of different interaction ranges between the cubic and quintic terms ( or , for that matter , combinations of local and nonlocal nonlinearities within the cubic and/or quintic terms ) . on the other hand , extensions to one dimensional settings with more wells",
    "would bring along a richer phenomenology ( in that setting the three - well local case has been studied  @xcite and was recently revisited in  @xcite ) , while in higher dimensional settings such as 2d , four well settings in a square configuration  @xcite or other configurations exploiting the geometry of the system would be interesting to study .",
