    "clusters of galaxies contain very hot gas , the intracluster medium ( icm ) . due to the extremely strong gravitational fields of clusters ,",
    "plasma that falls towards the center will gain significant gravitational potential energy , which results in temperatures in the icm of @xmath2@xmath3 k. with time , energy is lost due to x - ray radiation ( thermal bremsstrahlung and line emission from metals ) from the icm , which acts to cool the x - ray emitting gas unless these energy losses are balanced by some heating process .",
    "one would expect this cooling gas to flow toward the dense core of the cluster .",
    "the cooling process is known as a `` cooling flow . ''",
    "this process can potentially trigger star formation in the core .",
    "evidence for such cooling flows have been observed by the _",
    "einstein _ ,",
    "_ rosat _ , and _ asca _ observatories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted cooling rates from these observations are hundreds of solar masses per year .",
    "more recent observations made with the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ x - ray observatories suggest cooling rates that are at least an order of magnitude lower ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , with most of the gas only cooling down to about one third of the ambient cluster temperature .",
    "one of the proposed explanations of this phenomenon and a solution to the discrepancies in measured cooling rates is heating of the icm by a central radio source .",
    "these radio sources are thought to be the result of accretion events by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) within the central cd galaxies that are generally present in the centers of cooling core clusters .",
    "x - ray observations show that the lobes of the central radio sources can displace the x - ray emitting gas and leave `` holes '' in the icm , which are filled by the synchrotron plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some of the theoretical models for these `` radio bubbles '' predicted that the icm would be heated by strong shocks from the radio emitting plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , in most cases the observed shells of higher surface brightness surrounding the holes have been found to have lower temperatures than the surrounding gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , a few cases of radio lobes bounded by strong shocks have been observed @xcite . in addition , weak shocks or sound waves have been detected around the radio lobes in perseus @xcite .",
    "the energy output contained in the radio outbursts is found to be sufficient to counterbalance the cooling flow in many cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    in this paper , we present an analysis of a _ chandra _ observation of the cooling core cluster abell  2063 .",

    "the initial observation was interrupted due to a strong solar flare , and , as a result , the data were taken in three intervals of 14,162 s on 2005 march 30 , 16,824 s on 2005 april 1 , and 9906 s on 2005 april 5 .",
    "the nominal values of the pointing direction and roll angle were kept the same for all three observations , so that the instrument field - of - view ( fov ) is very nearly identical for the three observations .",
    "the pointing was chosen so that the cluster core was in the fov of the acis - s3 detector , and was 1away from the center of the detector in order to avoid the node boundaries on the chip .",

    "data was collected from chips 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 , but we only included data from chip 7 ( acis - s3 ) in the analysis of the cluster .",

    "the data was clipped on both sides of the mean if there was a difference of more than a factor of 1.2 from the mean .",
    "this resulted in excluding 5094 s of data from the first observation , 1001 s of data from the second observation , and 17 s of data from the third observation , leaving a cleaned total exposure of 34,779 s. however , subsequent analysis indicated that the background was elevated , particularly at moderate event energies , for all of the first observation .",
    "this did nt significantly affect the images of the center of the cluster where the surface brightness is very high .",
    "however , it would have been difficult to model the spectrum of this extra background component .",
    "thus , all of the spectral analysis was done excluding the first observation .",
    "the total exposure for spectral analysis was 25,711 s.    since the pointings of the three observations were essentially identical , the events files were merged into a single file using the ciao script merge_all . before doing this , the sources in the fov of the s3 in each of the individual observations were detected with the ciao tool wavdetect .",
    "the source positions were compared to check for any small systematic offsets .",
