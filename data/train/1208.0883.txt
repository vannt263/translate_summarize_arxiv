    "ising spin glass models yield phase diagrams with distinctively complex ordered phases , in @xmath5 . these models ,",
    "although relatively simple in their formulation , have been proposed to describe complex systems exhibiting frustration , e.g. , materials such as @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite , neural networks  @xcite etc .",
    "the simplest of such models , but most influential over the years , is the edwards anderson model  @xcite defined by the hamiltonian @xmath8 where the summation is over nearest - neighbors , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the uncorrelated quenched exchange interaction .",
    "there are two popular quenched random disorder distributions , the gaussian distribution of random bonds with zero mean and unity standard deviation and the bimodal distribution of @xmath10 given by @xmath11    recently , the spatially uniaxially anisotropic @xmath5 spin glass system has been solved exactly on a hierarchical lattice by guven et al .",
    "their general study revealed a rich phase diagram topology and several new interesting features .",
    "the hamiltonian of this anisotropic variant , differentiates , along @xmath12 axis , the probability distribution of quenched randomness , but also the strength of the exchange interaction and can be written @xmath13    accordingly , the bimodal distribution of @xmath14 takes the more general form @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath12 axis @xmath17 or the @xmath1 planes @xmath18 , @xmath14 denote the corresponding exchange interactions and @xmath19 are the probabilities of two neighboring spins ( @xmath20 ) having antiferromagnetic interaction along @xmath12 axis or the @xmath1 planes .    the standard isotropic case , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq:2 ] ) , corresponds to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the global phase diagram of this isotropic case , is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and , as shown , there exist ( in @xmath5 ) three distinctive phases , ferromagnetic , paramagnetic and glassy phases .",
    "all transitions among these phases , are believed to be of second order and also to belong to different universality classes .",
    "several accurate studies have been carried out , to determine the critical behaviors along these transition lines , for the finite - temperature phase transitions @xcite .",
    "most of these studies concern the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic ( fp ) and the glassy - paramagnetic ( gp ) lines .",
    "there is also a recent study for the ferromagnetic - glassy transition line  @xcite .",
    "the transition lines meet in a multicritical point  @xcite located along the nishimory line  @xcite with coordinates @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the fp transition line , starts at the pure ising model ( @xmath24 ) , for which all critical properties have been extensively studied and a recent very accurate estimate of the correlation length exponent is @xmath25  @xcite with a critical temperature @xmath26  @xcite . as shown by hasenbusch et al .",
    "@xcite , the introduction of the @xmath0 quenched randomness changes the universality of the model to that of the random ising model ( rim ) or randomly diluted ising model ( rdis )  @xcite , in which several spin models appear to belong .",
    "these , include models such as the randomly site and bond diluted , the random bond  @xcite , the random bond blume - capel  @xcite model and , of course , the already mentioned isotropic @xmath0 three - dimensional ising at the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition line  @xcite .",
    "an accurate estimate of the correlation length exponent for these @xmath5 fp transitions , characterizing the rim universality class , is that given by  @xcite @xmath27 .    for the glassy - paramagnetic ( gp ) transition line ( @xmath28 line in  fig.[fig:1 ] ) , most of the work has been curried out at @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "however , because of severe inherent difficulties , due to both strong frustration and disorder effects in this region , there is a large spread in the estimates of critical exponents and there remain some questions related to universality .",
    "this is very clearly reflected in table i of katzgraber et al .",
    "@xcite in which one can observe a very large spread in the correlation length exponent , and even in the estimates of critical temperature .",
    "we shall quote from this paper , the estimates @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which apply to the present isotropic @xmath0 spin - glass model .",
    "we will also quote the more recent estimates @xmath32 , @xmath33  @xcite . finally , from the recent work by ceccarelli et al .",
    "@xcite , we know that the correlation length exponent for the ferromagnetic - glassy ( fg ) transitions has been estimated to be @xmath34 .",
    "several other features of the critical behaviors and the global phase diagram are known for the isotropic case .",
    "ground state calculations by hartmann  @xcite ( @xmath35 ) , indicated a reentrant fg transition line .",
    "this was nicely verified by the finite temperature study of ceccarelli et al .",
    "@xcite , since they estimated @xmath36 , predicting the ferromagnetic - glassy transition line to be slightly reentrant .",

    "( [ eq:4 ] ) by considering the particular model case @xmath40 with @xmath21 .",
    "the present study is part of a research program to study by monte carlo methods the general spatially uniaxially anisotropic @xmath5 spin glass system considered by guven et al .",
    "the main motivation is to provide numerical evidence for the universality question , by investigating possible effects caused , by the introduced anisotropy , on the critical exponents along the three different transition lines .",
    "we hope that our attempts may also play some role in future studies and will provide new information for the critical behavior of frustrated systems .",
    "we start by describing our current perception on the global phase diagram of the above anisotropic case .",
    "this phase diagram is sketched also in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , by the dash lines .",
    "as shown , there exist again(in @xmath5 ) three distinctive phases , ferromagnetic , paramagnetic and glassy phases .",
    "the points shown on the fp transition line have been located from the peaks of the magnetic sample - averaged susceptibility for a lattice of size @xmath41 .",
    "the open asterisk ( see also the solid drop lines ) on this line indicate a special point corresponding to @xmath42 .",
    "this choice was inspired by the improved model case analyzed by hasenbusch et al .",
    "@xcite for the isotropic model ( see on the isotopic phase diagram the case with @xmath43 and the corresponding dash drop lines ) . according , to hasenbusch et al .",
    "@xcite for the isotropic case at @xmath44 the leading scaling corrections vanish and this case provides an improved model for accurate exponent estimation . our quest for a convenient and improved model case for the anisotropic fp transition , directed as to find the phase diagram point corresponding to about the same temperature as the isotropic phase diagram point . as can be seen , by comparing the drop lines",
    ", this would suggest the case @xmath42 .",
    "alternatively , let us try to satisfy the relation @xmath45 between the two fp transition lines .",
    "this prognostic method assumes that phase diagram points corresponding to the same temperature would have ( approximately ) the same ratio of ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "putting @xmath44 in this relation , we find @xmath46 , which is practically the above value for the anisotropic case .",
    "as it will be seen in the sequel , the proposed case @xmath42 provides indeed an excellent case and gives , for the anisotropic model , a very accurate estimate of the correlation length exponent(@xmath47 ) .",
    "the rest of the anisotropic phase diagram ( see also the caption of fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , was mainly constructed on the premise that the above relation may hold approximately for the lines separating the ferromagnetic phase from the other two phases .",
    "thus , applying this prognostic to the point @xmath48 of the isotropic case , we find that @xmath49 .",
    "quite remarkably we found from our ground state calculations a value that perfectly verify this prediction .",
    "based on the rather short calculation of ground states on lattices sizes @xmath50 we found , by a collapse method , @xmath51 astonishingly close to the predicted value .",
    "after this , the multicritical point for the anisotropic case , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] has been placed by a mere application of the above relation giving @xmath52 .",
    "one should , of course , realize that this prognostic is only an approximation , which could not be expected to apply in the more general case .",
    "it is possible that , it is only successful for the present case giving a reasonable approximation for the fp and fg transition lines . to complete our perception of the anisotropic phase diagram",
    ", we point out that for the case @xmath53 we found from monte carlo simulations a phase diagram point which appears to coincide with the isotopic phase diagram point @xmath54 . for instance , extrapolating the @xmath50 binder s fourth order cumulant crossings of the overlap order parameter we found @xmath55 , very close to the corresponding estimate of the isotropic case .",
    "this finding appears to be a very interesting and physically appealing prediction .",
    "a proof that @xmath56 exactly , may also help a better understanding of the general universality question . in closing this discussion , we shall mention that the introduction of anisotropy changes in general the phase diagram and possibly the symmetry of multicritical points , as discussed by guven et al .",
    "these multicritical points , such as in the present model case ( @xmath53 ) , do not necessarily obey nishimori conditions and one can not exclude the possibility of a ferromagnetic - glassy transition line being forward .",
    "however , our prognostic method , insist that the present anisotropic fg transition line is reentrant .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows : in the following subsection we give a description of our numerical approach utilized to derive numerical data for large ensembles of realizations of the disorder distribution and lattices with linear sizes within the range @xmath57 .",
    "then in subsection  [ sec:2b ] the finite - size scaling ( fss ) scheme is described in some detail . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we present all our fss attempts , that give good estimates of all critical exponents and verify that the present anisotropic model belongs to the universality class of rim .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in the present paper , we shall use our recent approach to disordered systems  @xcite , based on a parallel tempering ( pt ) practice .",
    "our pt protocol will use an adequate number of metropolis  @xcite sweeps of the lattice , as an elementary monte carlo step , so that the correlation times of the pt protocol will be , for all temperatures used , very close to @xmath58 .",
    "we mention here , that parallel tempering , combined with metropolis algorithm has been used also by ceccarelli et al .",
    "@xcite in their study of the fg transition .",
    "further , as pointed out by hasenbusch et al .",
    "@xcite , in their study of the isotropic case , the metropolis algorithm may be more effective than cluster dynamics , for intermediate lattice sizes , as a result of frustration effects present in the @xmath0 models .    our pt protocol ( also our fss approach ) has been described in detail in our recent paper  @xcite and only a brief summary is given here .",
    "for the estimation of the critical properties we generate mc data that cover several finite - size anomalies of the finite systems of linear size @xmath59 . the pt approach is carried over to a certain temperature range depending on the lattice size .",
    "these temperatures are selected in such a way that the exchange rate is @xmath60 , using a practice similar to that suggested in ref .",
    "the appropriate temperature sequences were generated via short preliminary runs in which we apply a simple histogram method  @xcite to determine from the energy probability density functions the temperatures , satisfying the above exchange condition  @xcite .",
    "the preliminary runs cover several disorder realizations and the average over the temperatures sequences provides us with a protocol with very small variation in the exchange rate condition , as one moves from one realization to the other .",
    "the proposed mc scheme was carefully tested for all lattice sizes before its implementation for the generation of mc data .",
    "the tests included the estimation of the mc times necessary for equilibration and thermal averaging process applied to a particular disorder realization , and involved also the observation of running sample - averages of several thermodynamic quantities , such as the magnetic susceptibility , at a temperature close to criticality .",
    "provided we use reasonably long mc times for equilibration and thermal averaging we find an effective cancellation of statistical errors from the sample - averaging process , since the sample - to - sample fluctuations are larger ( by an order of magnitude ) than the usual statistical errors ( in the thermal averaging process ) .",
    "the present simulation task is , of course , quite considerable , since we have to satisfy both a good equilibration of the system and also sum over a very large number of disorder realizations .",
    "the number of realizations influence the accuracy of our data , and the proper selection of temperatures influence their suitability for the locations of the finite - size anomalies .",
    "since we are implementing a pt approach , based on temperatures corresponding to an exchange rate @xmath60 , we are selecting proper temperature sequences consisting of a number of ( say 3 or 5 ) different temperatures and averaging for this set of temperatures over a relatively large number ( @xmath61 ) of disorder realizations .",
    "this yields a number of ( 3 or 5 ) points of the averaged curves @xmath62_{av}$ ] , where @xmath63 denote the thermal average of some thermodynamic quantity , such as the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the pt protocol is repeated several times ( depending on the linear size @xmath59 ) by using new sets of temperatures(translated with respect to the previous sets ) and a final dense set of points is obtained .",
    "the above is an efficient and most importantly quite accurate practice , since we finally obtain averaged curves corresponding to a very large number of realizations , describing with high accuracy all the averaged finite - size anomalies of the system .",
    "monte carlo data were collected for systems of linear sizes @xmath64 and the fss analysis was performed to the averaged quantities obtained from these mc data .      in the standard approach of fss for a random system",
    ", a large number of disorder realizations has to be used in the summations in order to obtain good sample - averages of the basic thermodynamic quantities @xmath63 , which are the usual thermal averages of a single disorder realization . from the disorder averages @xmath62_{av}$ ] we obtain their finite - size anomalies , denoted here as @xmath62_{av}^{\\ast}$ ] .",
    "these finite - size anomalies will be used in our fss attempts , following a quite common practice  @xcite .",
    "their temperature locations , denoted by @xmath65_{av}^{\\ast}}$ ] will be used in the sequel in our fss attempts .",
    "thus , our study concerns the critical exponents describing the disorder - averaged behavior and we do not attempt a fss analysis based on sample dependent pseudocritical temperatures .",
    "the later is , a more demanding alternative approach  @xcite , which considers the individual sample dependent maxima ( anomalies ) and the corresponding sample dependent pseudocritical temperatures .",
    "note that , for disordered systems one could make in principle a clear distinction between typical and averaged exponents  @xcite .    from the mc data ,",
    "several pseudocritical temperatures may be estimated , corresponding to finite - size anomalies and these are expected to follow a power - law shift behavior @xmath65_{av}^{\\ast}}=t_{c}+b_{z}\\cdot l^{-1/\\nu}$ ] .",
    "the traditionally used specific heat and magnetic susceptibility peaks , as well as the peaks corresponding to the following logarithmic derivatives of the powers @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 of the order parameter with respect to the inverse temperature @xmath69  @xcite , @xmath70 and the peak corresponding to the absolute order - parameter derivative @xmath71 will be located and used in our fitting attempts .    the behavior of the maxima of the logarithmic derivatives of the powers @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 of the order parameter with respect to the inverse temperature , which as is well known scale as @xmath72 with the system size  @xcite , will be seen to provide a smooth root for the estimation of the correlation length exponent @xmath73 .",
    "once the exponent @xmath73 is well estimated , the behavior of the values of the peaks corresponding to the absolute order - parameter derivative , which scale as @xmath74 with the system size  @xcite , gives one route for the estimation of the magnetic exponent ratio @xmath75 .",
    "for the estimation of the critical temperature , we shall use mainly a simultaneous fitting approach of the several pseudocritical temperatures mentioned above .",
    "however , from the mc data for the disorder averaged magnetization , it is possible to follow an optimum collapse method which will provide simultaneously estimates for the critical exponents @xmath76 as well as the critical temperature @xmath77 . from the scaling hypothesis @xmath78_{av}=m(t , l)=l^{-\\beta/ \\nu}{f}[(t - t_c)l^{1/ \\nu}],\\ ] ] and the disorder averaged magnetization data , we attempt in the next section the estimation of critical behavior by using a recently published collapse method that makes use of the downhill simplex algorithm  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the present study uses the finite - size anomalies of the sample average of the logarithmic derivatives of the powers ( @xmath79 ) of the order parameter with respect to the inverse temperature , for the estimation of the correlation length exponent @xmath73 .",

    "<S> we study the @xmath0 three - dimensional ising model with a spatially uniaxially anisotropic bond randomness on the simple cubic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 random exchange is applied in the @xmath1 planes , whereas in the z direction only a ferromagnetic exchange is used . after sketching the phase diagram and comparing it with the corresponding isotropic case , </S>",
    "<S> the system is studied , at the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition line , using parallel tempering and a convenient concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical data point out clearly to a second - order ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition belonging in the same universality class with the 3d random ising model . </S>",
    "<S> the smooth finite - size behavior of the effective exponents describing the peaks of the logarithmic derivatives of the order parameter provides an accurate estimate of the critical exponent @xmath3 and a collapse analysis of magnetization data gives an estimate @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these results , are in agreement with previous studies and in particular with those of the isotropic @xmath0 three - dimensional ising at the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition line , indicating the irrelevance of the introduced anisotropy . </S>"
