    "if we ignore philosophical arguments regarding ` naturalness ' , we can seriously consider a broader array of theories as being ` physical ' in the sense that they could realistically describe our universe .",
    "such a reconsideration is both theoretically plausible , in light of string / m - theory landscape considerations , and observationally motivated . because of data pressures on supersymmetric theories arising from higgs mass searches , limits on cp violation effects , etc .",
    ", it would be advantageous if one could assign to all the scalars in the theory ( with the exception of one light higgs particle ) masses at  @xcite or above  @xcite the pev scale while keeping the gauginos relatively light , with tev - scale masses , to constitute dark matter .",
    "taking anomaly - mediation as the origin of gaugino masses , but not scalar masses  @xcite , provides us with the desired mass hierarchy .",
    "if the chiral supermultiplet @xmath2 is charged under some symmetry , the scalar masses are generated via    @xmath3    as usual , but the equation that would normally generate the gaugino masses    @xmath4    is no longer gauge invariant .",
    "instead , the leading contribution to the gaugino masses arises at the one - loop level  @xcite and takes the form    @xmath5    where the index @xmath6 labels the three standard model gauge groups . explicit dependence of each gaugino mass on the beta function of the gauge group with which it is associated determines the ratio between them , which to lowest order is    @xmath7    if indeed the gravitino mass @xmath8 is at the pev - scale all the scalar sparticles acquire pev - scale masses while the gaugino masses are kept light , around the tev scale , in this construction , an example of what has come to be known as `` split supersymmetry ''  @xcite .",
    "since the gaugino mass hierarchy is determined by equation ( [ eq : m123 ] ) , the lightest supersymmetric particle must in general be some mixture of wino and higgsino ( in more general split supersymmetry models , the lsp may also have a significant bino fraction : this case is examined in  @xcite ) .",
    "the only parameter yet unspecified in this scenario that has any bearing on the identity of the lsp is the @xmath9 term . if @xmath10 , the lsp is wino - like ; if @xmath11 , it is higgsino - like ; and if the two are comparable , it will be a mixture of the two .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the case in which the lsp is effectively either pure wino or pure higgsino , noting that if @xmath12 , these two possibilities cover the vast majority of ( @xmath13 , @xmath9 ) parameter space .",
    "if the wino is the lsp , its thermal relic abundance  @xcite is given by    @xmath14    for a higgsino lsp , the result is    @xmath15    we can use the current wmap bound  @xcite on the abundance of cold dark matter in the universe    @xmath16    to find the mass the lsp would require in order to have an interesting relic density . in this paper , we will make the simplifying assumptions that this particle makes up all the dark matter in the universe and that its relic density is generated thermally .",
    "the result , in each case , is    @xmath17    if we allow for the possibility of other dark matter constituents , or for nonthermal lsp generation , these equations become an upper bound . in the purely thermal case , it should be noted that in order to make up even 20% of the dark matter in the universe , @xmath18 would still need to exceed 1 tev ( @xmath19 would be around 500 gev ) and that none of the particle properties relevant to the indirect detection methods discussed below ( e.g. annihilation cross - section into @xmath0-rays ) varies significantly over this mass range .",
    "if there are nonthermal contributions to the lsp relic density , however , any value of @xmath20 below the bound given by equations ( [ eq : mw ] ) and ( [ eq : mh ] ) is permitted .",
    "since theory has stipulated a tev - scale wino or higgsino as our dark matter candidate , it is reasonable to ask whether any signature of such a particle could be detected experimentally .",
    "direct detection of such a massive wino or higgsino lsp is effectively ruled out for all but the most unnaturally peaked halo models and the positron signal resulting from their annihilation would be too small to detect .",
    "the only truly promising detection method is to search for high - energy photons produced monoenergetically by wino annihilation in the galactic halo .",
    "these photons would have energies of    @xmath21    ( corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 processes respectively ) .",
    "presumably , as the concentration of dark matter is greatest in the center of the galaxy , one could aim a sufficiently powerful @xmath0-ray telescope at the galactic center and see a signal at around 2.3 tev .",
    "several recent papers  @xcite have discussed the feasibility of detecting such a signal , for lower - scale amsb scenarios at currently functioning or currently planned detectors",
    ". our approach will be rather to assume the specific , pev - scale theory outlined above and assess what performance attributes would render a detector capable of observing the @xmath0-ray signature of such particles .",
    "the cross - sections for the annihilation for a pair of winos or higgsinos into a pair of photons and into a photon and a z in anomaly - mediated susy - breaking scenarios have been examined by several authors  @xcite . in both the wino and higgsino cases",
    ", each cross - section tends toward an asymptotic value as @xmath24 increases . for @xmath24",
    "greater than a few hundred gev , @xmath25 and @xmath26 may effectively be replaced with their asymptotic values , which for a wino lsp are :    @xmath27    and for a higgsino lsp , are @xmath28 to be able to resolve the two lines would be an excellent test of the theory , but to do so for a 2.3 tev wino would require an energy resolution @xmath29 of better than 3.5% .",
    "although future satellite facilities comparable to glast may have this kind of energy resolution , these telescopes are unlikely to discover dark matter from pev - scale split supersymmetry for reasons we shall soon make clear . for ground - based detectors , which have far coarser energy resolutions ( on the order of 10 - 20% ) , the two signals will be indistinguishable and add together to form a single ` line ' .",
    "while the particle properties ( mass , cross - section , etc . ) of pev - scale amsb dark matter are more or less specified by the theory we have chosen , the distribution of that dark matter in the galaxy has yet to be specified .",
    "the shape of this distribution is important in determining the requirements for indirect detection of a 2.3 tev wino , but is also not well known .",
    "thus , rather than choosing any particular model , we focus on a representative set of halo profiles .",
    "these profiles are derived from numerical simulations  @xcite , and most take the form    @xmath30    where the three power - law indices @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath0 , along with the characteristic radius r , define a given model .",
    "the models we examine here include the moore et al .",
    "profile ( a relatively cuspy model ) , a pair of isothermal models , one with a smooth density distribution , the other with some clumping of the dark matter , and the widely used navarro - frenk - white profile .",
    "the choice of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath0 which defines each model is given in table  [ tab : abgvals ] .",
    "in addition to these , we include in our analysis the halo profile proposed by burkert et al .",
    "@xcite , for which the cdm density is modeled not by equation ( [ eq : albega ] ) , but by    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is a fiducial distance parameter .",
    "it has also been suggested that the presence of a massive black hole at the center of the galaxy could significantly alter the halo profile through the addition of a density spike at the galactic center  @xcite . however",
    ", as there is some debate over the precise effect the black hole would have , we will not consider this situation here .",
    "for a given distribution of dark matter @xmath35 , the observed integral flux of @xmath0-rays ( usually expressed in @xmath36 ) from lsp annihilations around the galactic center is    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , the cdm mass density , depends on both the line - of - sight distance element @xmath39 , the number @xmath40 of photons produced per decay , and the angle @xmath41 away from the galactic center , and the integral is evaluated along the line of sight .",
    "it is common to abstract the density integral , which depends on the halo profile but is independent of the particle physics , by defining the quantity    @xmath42    for a detector with angular acceptance @xmath43 , the relevant quantity is not @xmath44 , but rather @xmath45 , the average of @xmath46 over the solid angle given by @xmath43 .",
    "this quantity depends only on the value of @xmath43 and the choice of halo profile . in figure",
    "[ fig : jpsis ] , we show the relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath43 for some of the most commonly used halo models .",
    ".the defining parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath0 and @xmath47 ( see equation [ eq : albega ] ) for the halo models we examine .",
    "@xmath47 is given in kpc.[tab : abgvals ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the background for atmospheric cherenkhov detectors consists mainly of cascade events triggered by cosmic - ray protons , electrons , etc . , which dominate ( by an order or two of magnitude ) over the diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "showers initiated by leptons ( predominately electrons ) are indistinguishable from gamma - ray cascades , whereas hadronic showers can be differentiated to a degree due to the cascade s shape and to the time spread of the light pulse . while these backgrounds are higher than those seen by satellite detectors , their spectra are reliably known up to 5 tev .",
    "the power - law behavior  @xcite for each is given below :",
    "@xmath48    where we have replaced @xmath49 and the power - law index @xmath31 with their explicit numerical values .",
    "the factor of @xmath50 has been included to account for improved hadronic rejection techniques ( the default value of @xmath50=1 corresponds to the whipple telescope : instruments such as hess and veritas have already improved on this by a factor of four ) .    in figures  [ fig : flusp ] and",
    "[ fig : fluch ] , we show the expected gamma - ray flux from the 2.3 tev line as a function of angular acceptance , along with the expected background flux at a generic act and satellite detector whose performance attributes are slightly better than those of any currently planned facility ( see table  [ tab : detectors ] for performance specifics ) for a variety of different energy resolutions ranging from 5% to 50% .",
    "it is apparent that the integral background flux seen by a satellite detector will generally be at least two orders of magnitude below that seen by an act , regardless of the precise power - law form of the diffuse @xmath0-ray background .",

    "see figure  [ fig : fluch ] caption for the halo model key .",
    "the threshold for @xmath1 discovery has been included for reference in the significance graphs , and contours corresponding to 10 , 25 , and 100 events have been included in the event count graphs .",
    "it can be seen here that for such a space telescope , no halo profile is capable of producing the 25 events necessary for detection , and that only for the moore et al .",
    "profile is the significance criterion even achieved.[fig : eventssigsp ] ]    in order for the signal registered at any detector to be interpreted as a discovery , two conditions must be met : first , the significance level ( the ratio of @xmath53 , the total number of signal photons registered , to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the total number of background photons registered ) must exceed @xmath1 ; second , the total number of detected photons must exceed 25 , the threshold below which poisson statistics give an equivalent confidence limit level increases with improved energy resolution , these can be differentiated from a true signal by requiring the signal to be consistent over multiple trials . ] .",
    "these requirements , when written explicitly in terms of @xmath56 , @xmath29 , @xmath43 , and observation time , are    @xmath57    @xmath58    because the total number of collected photons is directly proportional to the collecting area , the second criterion implies that an act , with a characteristic @xmath56 on the order of @xmath59 , will be a more useful for detecting a pev - scale dark matter signal than a satellite detector with an @xmath56 of @xmath60 , despite the smaller background seen by the latter . in figures  [ fig : eventssigsp ] and",
    "[ fig : eventssigch ] , we plot the the total number of signal photons recorded by our generic satellite detector and cherenkhov array for a range of @xmath43 and an exposure time of @xmath61 s , in both the wino and higgsino lsp cases .",
    "even with the liberal assumptions of a wino - like lsp and a galactic halo density described by the moore et al .",

    "it can be seen here that there are real prospects for detection with such a cherenkhov detector , provided that the galactic cdm halo density resembles the nfw or moore et al .",
    "profiles.[fig : eventssigch ] ]    the situation is far more hopeful for cherenkhov detectors .",
    "since the field of view an act can attain is on the order of @xmath63 , detection would still be out of reach if the dark matter distribution was less sharply cusped ( such as in the isothermal and burkert profiles ) , but would be possible for a more concentrated dark matter halo .",
    "it is an interesting coincidence that the nfw profile nearly demarcates the line between detection and non - detection for presently operational facilities : if the actual dark matter distribution is cuspier than that given by the nfw profile , the @xmath0-ray signature of wino dark matter in pev - scale split supersymmetry should be detectable at the next generation of acts ; if the actual profile is much less sharply peaked ( e.g. if it resembles the smooth isothermal case ) , it is unlikely that such a signal would ever be detectable at an act .",

    "[ fig : contch ] ]    an interesting question to ask , especially if current facilities would be unable to register a discovery , is what attributes would a detector need in order to conclusively discover wino or higgsino dark matter in a pev - scale split supersymmetry scenario . since collection area and angular acceptance ( which may be adjusted as desired over a window ranging from a detector s angular resolution ( in steradians ) to its field of view ) have the most significant effect on the detection capabilities of any given instrument",
    ", we will focus on the effect of improvements in @xmath56 and @xmath43 . in figure",
    "[ fig : contch ] , we show the contours defined by equations ( [ eq : fivesigma ] ) and ( [ eq : eventcount ] ) in @xmath56-@xmath43 space for @xmath52 of viewing time , where the @xmath29 values used in computing the significance limits are those for the glast telescope and the veritas array ( see table  [ tab : detectors ] ) , along with the attributes of glast and veritas themselves , which appear as bars due to our freedom to adjust @xmath43 .",
    "the criterion for discovery at either of these facilities is that for a given halo model , both the @xmath1 and @xmath67 contours for that model lie below the corresponding bar . from this figure ,",
    "it is evident that glast , primarily due to its small effective area , would be unable to detect cdm from pev - scale split supersymmetry at all .",
    "detection would be possible at veritas , provided that the dark matter distribution is nt too much flatter than the nfw profile . if the halo resembles the burkert or isothermal profiles , however , neither facility ( and no telescope present or currently planned ) would be able to register a @xmath1 discovery .    because of their inherently large collection areas , cherenkhov detectors are currently the best bet for the discovery of dark matter from pev - scale split supersymmetry .",
    "the collection area of an act may be increased by the addition of more telescopes in the array , but the increment supplied by each individual telescope is merely additive , meaning it would not be feasible to raise @xmath56 by two orders of magnitude over that of veritas .",
    "it would , however , be possible to engineer an act with a larger field of view : the fields of view for present and planned facilities are kept on the order of @xmath68 primarily as a mechanism to deal with the effects of secondary electron scattering on the detector s low - energy response which will not affect observations in the tev range . operating at a large @xmath43 , such an instrument would be able to register a discovery for a range of more gently sloping halo profiles .    since acts are intrinsically limited in energy resolution to @xmath69 by uncertainties in reconstructing the energy of the initial photon from its cascade products  @xcite",
    ", future facilities would still be unable to see the telltale indication that an observed @xmath0-ray signal is the result of dark matter annihilation : the resolution of the @xmath70 and @xmath71 lines .",
    "satellite detectors are already approaching this level of energy resolution , and so it is of particular interest whether a space - based facility could ever be built that would be able to detect them .",
    "the difficulty , of course , is that even count considerations would mandate that the detection array be at least @xmath72 on a side , and that keeping such an object operational for @xmath52 ( considering potential disasters relating to solar wind , space debris , etc . that such an object would face ) , let alone launching it into into space , amount to a nearly insurmountable problem .",
    "it might be possible someday to construct such a detection array on the far side of the moon , where the weight and area of the detector would not be an impediment , but unless a project of this sort were undertaken , it is unlikely that we would ever see the conclusive double - line signal of dark matter in pev - scale split supersymmetry .",
