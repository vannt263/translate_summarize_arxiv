    "a curve is a mathematical model which describes the  path ( or locus ) of a continuously moving point \" .",
    "therefore , a planar curve is defined in mathematics as the image of a continuous function @xmath0 \\to \\ir^2 $ ] .",
    "surprisingly , under this definition , a curve can be so complicated that it fills even a square ( cf .",
    "in fact , as shown independently by hahn and mazurkiewicz in about 1913 , a point set is a curve if and only if it is a locally connected continuum ( we ignore the mathematical details in this paper which are not related to our discussion ) .",
    "however , if we are interested only in the curves which do not cross themselves ( i.e. , _ simple _ ) and have finite length ( i.e. , _ rectifiable _ ) , then the curves defined in these ways coincide with our intuition about  curves \" and they do have the `` two - sidedness '' and  thinness \" ( cf @xcite ) . for rectifiable simple curves , the parametrizations can be required to be injective or length - normalized while the induced class of curves remains the same . therefore , a rectifiable simple curve can be defined as any of the following : a point set of some special topological properties , the image of a continuous function , the image of an injective continuous function , or the image of a continuous function which is length - normalized .",
    "if a point - movement is `` algorithmically determined '' , then its path ( the curve ) should be considered `` computable '' .",
    "more precisely , the notion of computable curves can be defined by the effectivization of the classical definition of curves .",
    "this naturally raises the question whether the effectivizations of these four definitions of curves mentioned above lead to the same notion of `` computable curves '' ?",
    "our answer is no , even in a very strong sense .",
    "before we can explain our answer in a more precise way , let us recall first the basic idea of how to define computability of continuous objects in general .",
    "in computable analysis , computability over various continuous structures is typically defined by the turing - machine - based bit model ( see @xcite ) . in order to input a real number @xmath1 to such a turing machine",
    ", it must be represented by effectively convergent sequences of rational numbers ( the _ names _ of @xmath1 ) . here",
    ", a sequence @xmath2  converges effectively \" means that @xmath3 for all @xmath4 .",
    "a real number @xmath1 is computable if it has a computable name , i.e. , there is a computable sequence of rational numbers which converges to @xmath1 effectively .",
    "furthermore , a real function @xmath5 is computable if there is a turing machine which computes @xmath5 in the sense that , after inputing any name of a real number @xmath1 in the domain of @xmath5 , the machine outputs a name of @xmath6 . by the same principle , computability of other mathematical objects",
    "can be defined by introducing proper  naming systems \" .",
    "for example , the computability of subsets of the euclidean space @xcite , of semi - continuous functions @xcite , of functional spaces @xcite are all defined in this way .",
    "this approach is also called the  effectivization \" of classical mathematical definitions .",
    "the same approach can be applied to curves as well . in this paper , we only consider plane curves . curves in higher dimensions can be discussed in essentially the same way .",
    "furthermore we will restrict ourselfes to rectifiable curves unless otherwise said , where a curve is _ rectifiable _ if it has a finite length .",
    "as mentioned above , a curve can be defined as a connected and one - dimensional compact subset .",
    "based on this approach , we can define the computable curves by means of the computability of compact subsets of euclidean space ( @xcite ) .",
    "physically , a curve records the trace of a particle motion . if the particle moves according to some algorithmically definable laws , its trace should be regarded as computable . in mathematical terms , a curve is the range of a continuous function defined on a closed interval and this function is called a parametrization of the curve .",
    "thus , it is also natural to call a curve computable if it has a computable parametrization ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    however , the parametrization of a curve may have various extra properties , if the curve is simple . here",
    "a curve is called _ simple _ if it does not intersect itself , or if it has an injective parametrization .",
    "of course , the parametrization @xmath5 of a simple curve @xmath7 is not necessarily injective .",
    "if @xmath5 is not injective , then @xmath5 retraces some parts of the curve @xmath7 .",
    "if a curve @xmath7 is simple , then it has even an arc - length normalized parametrization . here , a parametrization @xmath8 \\to c$ ] is arc - length normalized roughly means that the function @xmath5 models a particle movement along the curve @xmath7 with a constant speed .    in this paper ,",
    "four versions of computable curves are introduced by effectivizing the above four mathematical approaches to curves .",
    "we will see that these four versions of computable curves are all different .",
    "the difference of the curve classes defined by simple computable parametrizations and computable injective parametrizations was already shown by gu , lutz and mayordomo in a recent paper @xcite . however , in this paper we will distinguish these four versions of computable curves in a much stronger sense .",
    "namely , the sets of points covered by the four classes of computable curves are different .",
    "in other words , different versions of computable curves can be separated by the points they cover , or they are  point - separable \" ( see definition in section [ sec - point - separable ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the computability of the curve length plays an important role for the computability of curves .",
    "if we look only at curves of computable lengths , then the four effectivizations mentioned above are indeed equivalent .",
    "this means that the definition of computable curves is robust , at least , for curves of computable lengths . on the other hand , gu , lutz and mayordomo constructed in @xcite a computable curve of non - computable length such that none of its computable parametrizations can be injective ,",
    "although the curve does not intersect itself .",
    "as an open question , they asked whether _",
    "there exists a point which lies on a computable curve of finite length , but not on any computable curve of computable length _ ,",
    "i.e. , if the class of computable curves of computable lengths is point - separable from the class of computable curves of finite lengths . a positive answer will be given in this paper .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - comp - curve ]",
    "we will briefly recall some basic notions related to curves , give the precise definition of computable curves and then show some basic properties of computable curves . in section [ sec - point - separable ] , we discuss some basic facts of point - separable classes and show a technical lemma which will be used in the proof of the main theorems .",
    "section [ sec - n - comp - curve ] investigates the class of length - normalized computable curves and shows a significant difference between this class and the class of computable curves of computable lengths .",
    "then it is shown that these two classes are point - separable . in the last section [ sec - main ]",
    "we prove that the four classes of computable curves mentioned above are all point - separable .",
    "in mathematics , a _ plane curve _ is defined as a subset @xmath9 which is the range of a continuous function @xmath10\\to \\ir^2 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "this continuous function @xmath5 is then called a _ parametrization _ of @xmath7 . here , we use , w.l.o.g . ,",
    "the unit interval @xmath12 $ ] instead of more general closed intervals of the form @xmath13 $ ] . obviously , any curve has infinitely many parametrizations .",
    "geometrically , a curve records the path of a particle movement in the plane .",

    "simple_. the simple curves defined in this way are also called _",
    "open _ , or _",
    "jordan arcs_. if a curve @xmath7 has a parametrization @xmath5 which is injective on the interval @xmath14 and fulfills the condition that @xmath15 , then the curve @xmath7 is traditionally also called _ simple _ , but it is _ closed _ , or a _",
    "jordan curve_. equivalently , a jordan curve is the continuous image of the unit circle . in this paper",
    "we look only at the open simple curves . but all results are true for closed simple curves as well .    for open simple curves , their lengths can be defined by means of the lengths of polygons which approximate the curves according to jordan @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath7 be a simple curve and let @xmath10 \\to \\ir^2 $ ] be an injective continuous parametrization of @xmath7 .",
    "then the _ length _ @xmath16 of the curve @xmath7 is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the length of the straight line connecting the points @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the supremum is taken over all possible partitions @xmath21 of the unit interval @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the length of a curve @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "notice that we actually defined the length @xmath23 of the function @xmath10\\rightarrow \\ir^2 $ ] .",
    "the length of a simple curve is then the length of an injective parametrization of that curve .",
    "it is well known that the length of a simple curve is independent from its ( injective ) representations .",
    "a curve of finite length is traditionally called _",
    "rectifiable_. not every curve , even a simple curve , has finite length . as already mentioned above , we focus mainly on simple rectifiable curves ; unless otherwise stated a curve is always meant to be simple and rectifiable in this paper",
