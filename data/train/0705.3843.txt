    "bright quasars at @xmath2 are very luminous and rare objects that can can be detected out to huge cosmological distances in very large area surveys like the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "their estimated space density is @xmath11 @xcite , that is about one object per about @xmath12 deg@xmath13 of sky , assuming a depth of @xmath14 centered at @xmath15 under the third year wmap cosmology @xcite .",
    "their luminosity is thought to be due to accretion onto a super - massive black hole ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "a common expectation is that the luminous high - z quasars sit at the center of the biggest proto - clusters at that time .",
    "some observational evidence of over - densities of galaxies in two deep hst - acs fields containing a bright z=6 quasar has been claimed @xcite , but it is unclear whether this is true in general .",
    "in fact an acs image only probes a long and narrow field of view of about @xmath16 in the redshift range @xmath17 $ ] , so a significant number of detections may come from galaxies unrelated to the environment of the host halo of the bright quasar .    numerical simulations to address the formation of bright quasars are extremely challenging given their low number density .",
    "a huge simulation cube with edge of @xmath18 is required just to expect , on average , one such object in the simulation box .",
    "a major computational investment , like the millennium run @xcite , is required to resolve at high redshift ( @xmath19 ) virialized halos on this volume and to follow their merging history down to @xmath0 . even assuming that the simulation volume is big enough that there is the expectation to find halos hosting bright quasars , how can these halos be identified ? in principle two , non mutually exclusive , alternatives appear plausible : either the super - massive black holes are hosted in the most massive halos with the corresponding number density of sdss quasars or these black holes have grown from the first popiii intermediate mass black hole seeds , therefore representing the descendant of the rarest density peaks that hosted first stars .",
    "the first scenario implies that the @xmath20 relation @xcite is already in place at high redshift @xcite . in that case",
    "multigrid simulations can be carried out to follow in detail the growth of the supermassive black hole ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . in the second scenario the quasars progenitors",
    "would be traced back to the first popiii stars created in the universe within @xmath3 mass halos virialized at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these popiii stars are very massive @xmath22 , so after a short life of a few million years explode and may leave intermediate mass black holes , plausible seeds for the super - massive black holes observed at lower redshift .",
    "of course the two scenarios can be consistent with each other if the first perturbations to collapse are also the most massive at @xmath6 .",
    "this seems to be implied , e.g. in @xcite , where the bright quasar candidate in the simulation is traced back to one of the 18 collapsed halos at @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    "we explore the link between the first popiii halos collapsed in a simulation box and the most massive halos at lower redshifts to gain insight on the scenarios of bright quasar formation .",
    "this is a numerically challenging problem as the dynamical range of masses involved is very large : a simulation volume of @xmath24 has a mass of about @xmath25 , that is more than @xmath1 times the mass of a popiii dark matter halo .",
    "we have adopted an original approach to the problem , broadly inspired by the tree method by @xcite .",
    "we first simulate at relatively low resolution the evolution of a simulation volume down to @xmath26 .",
    "then , starting from the density fluctuations field in the initial conditions of the numerical simulation , we compute analytically the redshift distribution of the oldest popiii halo collapsed within each single grid cell .",
    "the information is then used as input for a monte carlo code to sample for each particle of the simulation the collapse redshift of the first popiii progenitor dark matter halo .",
    "the formation time of the oldest popiii remnant within the most massive halos identified at @xmath2 is finally compared with that of the oldest popiii star sampled over the whole simulation volume and the implications for the growth of supermassive black holes are discussed .",
    "our approach is tuned to investigate the formation and the subsequent remnant distribution of the first , rare density peaks that hosted popiii stars at @xmath27 . with this respect",
    "our study has a similar goal to @xcite , with the important difference that we search for the first popiii star in the complete simulation box and not by means of progressive refinements around substructures that probe only a small fraction of the total box volume .",
    "as our method is tuned at finding very rare fluctuations , it is not easily applied to the significantly more common @xmath28 peaks with mass @xmath29 that collapse at @xmath30 and that might constitute the majority of popiii stars , if these are terminated by chemical feedback at @xmath31 ( e.g. see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and not by photo - dissociation of molecular hydrogen at @xmath32 @xcite .",

    "the initial conditions have been generated using a code based on the grafic algorithm @xcite .",
    "an initial uniform lattice is perturbed using a discrete realization of a gaussian random field sampled in real space and then convolved in fourier space with a @xmath47 transfer function computed using the fit by @xcite and assuming a scale invariant long - wave spectral index ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the initial density field is saved for later reprocessing through the first light monte carlo code ( see sec .",

    "the particles velocities and displacements are then evolved to the desired starting redshift ( @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 ) using the zeldovich approximation and the evolution is followed using gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "dark matter halos are identified in the simulations snapshots using the hop halo finder @xcite .    to find the optimal trade - off between mass resolution and box size , both critical parameters to establish a connection between popiii halos and the most massive halos identified at @xmath6 , we resort to simulations ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : sim ] ) with three different box sizes , all simulated with @xmath51 particles :    * a `` large '' box size of edge @xmath52 that is large enough to contain on average about one bright high - z quasar .",
    "the mass resolution is @xmath53 ( corresponding to a halo of 20 particles ) . *",
    "a `` medium '' box size of edge @xmath54 that represents a compromise between a slightly higher mass resolution than @xmath55 and a still reasonably large simulation volume . * a `` small '' box size of edge @xmath56 .",
    "while this box size is too small to host a bright @xmath2 quasar , its volume is still larger than that of deep surveys like the udf @xcite , that spans a volume about @xmath57 times smaller than this box in the redshift interval @xmath58 $ ] ( the typical redshift uncertainty for @xmath59-dropouts ) .",
    "halos down to about @xmath60 can be identified in this box .",
    "the analysis of the results from this simulation will show the fundamental role played by the large volume employed for simulations ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "given the initial density fluctuations field on the simulation grid , where a cell has a mass of order @xmath61 , our goal is to estimate the redshift of the first virialized perturbation within each cell at the mass scale of early popiii dark matter halos ( i.e. @xmath62 , see e.g. @xcite ) . for this",
    "we resort to an analytical treatment based on a linear approximation for structure formation .",
    "the initial conditions for a n - body simulation in a box of size @xmath63 with @xmath64 particles and a single particle mass @xmath65 define a gaussian random field @xmath66 for the n cells ( associated to the location of the n particles ) of the simulation grid .",
    "this density field is usually generated by convolving white noise with the transfer function associated to the power spectrum of the density perturbations ( e.g. , see @xcite ) and is used to obtain the initial velocity and positions displacements for the particles ( e.g. see eq .",
    "5.115 in @xcite ) .",
    "the density fluctuation in each cell has a contribution from different uncorrelated frequencies in the power spectrum .",
    "when the initial conditions for an n - body simulation are generated , the power spectrum has an upper cutoff around the nyquist frequency for the grid used ( i.e. around the frequency associated to the average inter - particle distance ) and a lower cutoff at the frequency associated to the box size ( if periodic boundary conditions are enforced ) .",
    "a higher resolution version of the initial density field can be obtained by simply increasing the grid size and adding the density perturbations associated to the power spectrum between the old and the new cutoff frequencies .    in linear approximation",
    "one can use the field @xmath67 to obtain the redshift of virialization of a structure of mass @xmath68 at a given position @xmath69 in the grid . to do this",
    "one averages the field @xmath67 using a spherical window centered at @xmath69 with a radius such that the window encloses a mass @xmath70 and computes assuming linear growth the redshift at which the average density within the window reaches @xmath71 ( in units where the average density of the box is 1 ) .",
    "in fact , for a spherical collapse model , when @xmath71 in linear theory , then the halo has reached virial equilibrium under the full non - linear dynamics .",
    "this concept is at the base of the various proposed methods for computing analytically the mass function of dark matter halos ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we apply this idea to estimate the formation rate and the location in the simulation volume of dark matter halos at a mass scale below the single particle mass used in the simulation .",
    "a straightforward implementation consists in generating first the density field associated to the n - body simulation , and then to refine at higher resolution the field by means of a constrained realization of the initial conditions used in the n - body run ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "this provides exact and complete information on the whole density field , but the price to pay is the execution of very large fast fourier transforms on the refined grid . if the goal is to compute density fluctuations down to a mass of @xmath72 over a box of edge @xmath73 , a grid of @xmath74 is needed , which would require about @xmath75 tb of ram , that is well beyond the current memory capabilities of the largest supercomputers .",
    "a shortcut is however available , if one trades information for numerical complexity . given a realized numerical simulation , we are in fact not interested in getting a detailed picture of the dynamics at sub - grid resolution , but only in identifying for each grid point the redshift of virialization of its first progenitor at a given sub - grid mass scale .",
    "for example , given a simulation with single particle mass of @xmath76 our aim is to quantify the redshift of virialization of the _ first _ dark matter halo of mass @xmath77 within the volume associated to the @xmath76 particle . in that case , if we were to have the full sub - grid information we would search for the maximum realized value of the density within the @xmath78 sub - grid cells of mass @xmath79 that constitute our @xmath76 single particle cell . as the density fluctuation field is a gaussian random field , the density in sub - grid cells will be a gaussian centered at the density of the parent cell and with variance given by integration of the power spectrum of density fluctuations truncated between the niquist frequency of the parent cell and that of the sub - cells .",
    "therefore , for a single cell of mass @xmath65 , the redshift of collapse of a sub - grid progenitor at a mass scale @xmath80 can be obtained simply by sampling from the probability distribution of the maximum of the sub - grid fluctuations of the @xmath81 sub - cells of mass @xmath80 that are within a cell of mass @xmath65 .",
    "the probability distribution for the maximum of these fluctuations is available in analytic form when the field is gaussian , as in the case considered here .",
    "in fact , given a probability distribution @xmath82 , with partition function @xmath83 : @xmath84 the probability distribution @xmath85 for the maximum @xmath86 of @xmath87 random numbers extracted from @xmath82 ( @xmath88 ) is the derivative of the partition function for @xmath86 , that in turns is simply the @xmath87-th power of the partition function for @xmath89 , i.e. @xmath83 .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath90 eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxpdf ] ) has a simple interpretation : the probability that the maximum of @xmath87 random numbers lies in the interval @xmath91 $ ] is given by the probability of sampling one of the @xmath87 numbers exactly in that interval and all the other numbers below @xmath86 .    with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxpdf ] ) we can sample the distribution of the maximum of the additional sub - grid density fluctuations that need to be considered in order to probe the mass scale of popiii halos .",
    "the variance @xmath92 to be used in @xmath82 may be computed from the power spectrum of the density fluctuations by considering an upper cut - off at the wavelength of one cell size in the initial conditions . or , equivalently ,",
    "if the complete power spectrum of density fluctuations has variance @xmath93 at the mass scale of one grid cell and variance @xmath94 at the mass scale of a halo hosting a first star , we set @xmath92 such that : @xmath95 therefore our recipe for estimating the age of the earliest progenitor formed in each cell is the following :    * starting from the initial density fluctuation field on the grid used to initialize the n - body run compute the mass refinement factor @xmath87 to go from the mass of a single particle ( i.e. the mass within one grid cell ) to that of a popiii star halo ( @xmath96 ) . * given the power spectrum of the density fluctuations , @xmath97 and @xmath98 compute @xmath92 . *",
    "extract one random number @xmath99 from @xmath85 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : maxpdf ] ) where @xmath100 is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath92 . * sum @xmath99 to the value of the density field in the cell to obtain @xmath101 in the cell . from the value of @xmath102 it is then straightforward to compute the non - linear redshift for that perturbation , i.e. the redshift @xmath103 when the linear density contrast reaches a value @xmath104 .",
    "the particles of the simulation now carry the additional information of the redshift at which their _ first _ popiii star dark matter halo progenitor has collapsed in linear theory ( a proxy for the redshift of actual virialization ) .",
    "once halos have been identified in simulation snapshots , the redshift of the earliest popiii progenitor within the halo is easily obtained .",
    "it is similarly easy to identify in a snapshot what is the environment in which the particles with the oldest progenitors live .",
    "this procedure is robust with respect to variations of the simulation resolution , as long as the focus is on rare density peaks , with an average occupation number per simulation cell ( i.e. particle ) much smaller than unity .",
    "numerical tests are presented in appendix  [ sec : app ] .",
    "this method has two main advantages :    1 .",
    "it allows to use relatively inexpensive `` low resolution '' simulations to identify the largest objects at low redshift ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "in fact if we are interested in identifying the most massive halos at @xmath2 as host halos for quasar candidates a mass resolution of @xmath106 is sufficient ( e.g. in @xcite the mass of the largest halo at @xmath107 is @xmath108 for a simulation volume of @xmath109 ) .",
    "2 .   for a given numerical simulation",
    ", several monte carlo realization can be generated to gather robust statistical constraints on the properties of dark matter halos hosting first light sources as well as the spatial distributions of the first halo remnants in halos at lower redshift .",
    "however our method has the drawback that it can not be easily extended to the investigation of the detailed merging history at the sub - grid level , as only the virialization time of the earliest progenitor of each particle at a given mass scale is provided .",
    "in addition , the identification of the first virialized popiii halos is expressed in terms of the halos with the highest @xmath103 .",
    "we are therefore neglecting the non - linear evolution and the environmental dependences on the dynamics of the dark matter collapse , such as tidal forces , therefore missing the precise redshift at which a popiii halo virializes .",
    "these are limitations that we need to accept as the non linear evolution could be followed over the whole box only at the price of running a simulation prohibitively intensive in cpu and memory resources , with at least @xmath110 time more particles than in the millenium run @xcite .",
    "this appears unfeasible for the time being , even considering next generation dedicated supercomputers , like the grapedr @xcite .",
    "the general picture for the connection between first halos and the most massive halos at @xmath2 can be obtained using analytical considerations , that will be later confirmed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mcres ] by the results of our numerical investigation .    following the choice for our large box simulation",
    ", we consider a volume of @xmath111 of mass @xmath112 , large enough to host a bright @xmath2 quasar .",
    "we estimate from the press - schechter formalism ( see also the masses of the @xmath6 halos in our `` large '' box simulation in sec .  [",
    "sec : mcres ] ) that the most massive halo at @xmath113 has a mass ( that we call @xmath114 ) of about @xmath115 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since the most massive halo is the first at its mass scale to be formed , through the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : maxpdf ] we can obtain the distribution of its initial density fluctuation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pdf ] ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath116 ( in agreement with @xcite ) , this halo is expected to have originated from a density fluctuation in the range @xmath117 \\sigma(m_{qh})$ ] at @xmath118 of confidence level .",
    "we now consider the volume initially occupied by the mass @xmath114 and we compute from the primordial power spectrum the variance @xmath92 of density perturbations at mass scale of a popiii halo ( @xmath119 ) considering only contributions from wavelengths at a scale below the volume enclosed by @xmath114 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath120 . from eq .",
    "[ eq : maxpdf ] follows that the maximum of @xmath121 gaussian random numbers with variance @xmath92 is distributed in the range @xmath122 \\sigma(m_{qh } ) $ ] at @xmath123 of confidence level .",
    "combining the two @xmath123 confidence level intervals , this means that the first popiii progenitor of a bright quasar originated from a perturbation in the range @xmath124 \\sigma(m_{qh})$ ] . if we consider instead a random sub - cell among the @xmath121 , the probability that the maximum sub - grid perturbation is smaller than @xmath125 is only @xmath126 , so several hundreds of the @xmath127 cells among the whole simulation volume are expected to have a popiii progenitor formed before that of the most massive @xmath6 halo . in fact from integration of eq .",
    "[ eq : maxpdf ] , the sigma peak associated to the _ first _ star in the box is expected to be greater than @xmath128 at 99.99 % of confidence level ( and in the interval @xmath129 \\sigma(m_{qh})$ ] at @xmath123 of confidence level ) .",
    "therefore the rarity of the earliest popiii progenitor of the most massive halo at @xmath6 is about @xmath130 less than that of the _ first _ popiii star formed in the simulation volume . in terms of formation redshift ,",

    "the picture changes quite significantly if we consider a smaller box size .",

    "here we review the question adopting two different definitions to characterize the transition from the first to the second generation of stars , namely ( i ) a threshold for the transition given by the destruction of molecular hydrogen and ( ii ) a metallicity based threshold .",
    "one criterion for the end of the first light epoch can be based on the destruction of molecular hydrogen in the ism due to photons in the lyman - werner ( @xmath203 ev$ ] ) energy range emitted by popiii stars .",
    "@xmath204 is in fact needed for cooling of the gas in dark matter halos of mass @xmath205 ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "the flux in the lyman - werner band is about @xmath206 of the ionizing flux ( i.e. with an energy range above @xmath207 ) .",
    "a popiii star is expected to emit a total of about @xmath208 photons per solar mass @xcite , so if we assume @xmath209 as a typical mass we have about @xmath210 @xmath204-destroying photons emitted over the stellar lifetime .",
    "only a fraction @xmath211 of these photons can effectively destroy an @xmath204 , molecule , as the most probable outcome of absorption of a lyman werner photon is a first decay to a highly excited a vibrational level that later returns to the fundamental state , with resulting re - emitted photons below the @xmath212 ev threshold @xcite .",
    "therefore we estimate that @xmath213 @xmath204 molecules will be destroyed by a popiii star . given the neutral hydrogen number density @xmath214 this means that a popiii star destroys @xmath204 over a volume @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen . assuming a primordial molecular hydrogen fraction @xmath217 ( e.g. see @xcite ) , we obtain that a popiii star has the energy to destroy primordial @xmath204 in a volume of @xmath218 .",
    "this number is in broad agreement with detailed radiative transfer simulations by @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , it is immediate to see that by @xmath201 the popiii number density has reached the critical level of @xmath219 and therefore around that epoch the radiation background destroys all the primordial @xmath204 . once all the primordial @xmath204 has been cleared the universe becomes transparent in the lyman werner bands and the new @xmath204 formed during the collapse of gas clouds is dissociated by the background radiation .",
    "in fact , assuming that the abundance of @xmath204 formed during collapse is @xmath220 ( e.g. see @xcite ) , this means that a collapsing @xmath221 halo produces about @xmath222 @xmath204 molecules , a negligible number with respect to the @xmath223 @xmath204 that are destroyed .",
    "our simple estimate therefore suggests that around @xmath201 the star formation rate of popiii stars in @xmath224 halos is greatly suppressed and proceeds in a self - regulated fashion where only a fraction @xmath202 of the collapsing halos are actually able to cool and lead to the formation of massive popiii stars .",
    "eventually the lyman werner background is maintained by popiii stars formed in more massive halos ( @xmath225 ) , cooled by atomic hydrogen , and , at later times , by popii stars .",
    "inspired by these ideas we set the end of the _ primordial _",
    "epoch for popiii formation at the point where the primordial @xmath204 has been destroyed , that is around @xmath201 . of course",
    "this is only an order of magnitude estimate and to fully address the feedback due to photo - dissociating lyman werner photons realistic radiative transfer cosmological simulations are needed , which may led even to positive feedback ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "in particular our estimate does not take into account the effects of self - shielding and the fact that the formation timescale for @xmath204 during the halo collapse may be faster than the timescale for photo - dissociation by the background radiation .",
    "thus it is possible that the popiii star formation rate at @xmath226 is not suppressed as much as predicted by our argument .",
    "however our estimate seems to be in broad agreement with the more realistic model by @xcite that predicts the onset of a significant negative feedback at @xmath32 , depending on the assumed efficiency of lyman werner photon production .",
    "another possibility to end the first star epoch is based on a ism metallicity threshold .",
    "however , in this case a clear transition epoch is missing ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "this is because metal enrichment , driven by stellar winds whose typical velocities are many orders of magnitude lower than the speed of light , is mainly a local process",
    ". therefore pockets of primordial gas may exists in regions of space that have experienced relatively little star formation , such as voids , even when the average metallicity in the universe is above the critical threshold assumed to define the end of the popiii era .",
    "in any case this definition provides a longer duration for the first star era .",
    "in fact to enrich the local metallicity above the @xmath227 threshold , relevant for stopping popiii formation by chemical feedback ( see @xcite ) , one @xmath209 sn must explode for every @xmath228 total mass volume ( dm+barions ) , assuming on average a popiii mass of @xmath209 with yield @xmath229 . for a milky way like halo , this means that about 3000 first stars sn are needed to enrich the igm to the critical metallicity .",
    "accordingly to this definition , the pop iii epoch would end within a significant fraction of the total simulated volume around @xmath230 , when there is the collapse of dark matter halos originated from @xmath231 peaks at the @xmath224 mass scale ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if the suppression in the popiii star formation rate due to lack of @xmath204 cooling is neglected .",
    "a further caveat is that very massive stars may end up directly in intermediate mass black holes without releasing the produced metals in the igm @xcite .",
    "from our investigation it is clear that , before the first popiii progenitor of the most massive halo at @xmath6 is born , several thousands of intermediate mass ( @xmath232 ) black hole seeds are planted by popiii stars formed in a cosmic volume that will on average host a bright @xmath6 quasar .",
    "this result does not allow to establish an immediate correlation between the very first popiii stars created in the universe and the bright @xmath6 quasars , but neither does it exclude such a link , as the formation epoch for the quasar seed is still at very high redshift ( @xmath233 ) , when radiative feedback from other popiii stars already formed is unlikely to affect the formation and evolution of the seed ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : h2 ] ) . here",
    "we investigate with a simple merger tree code what is the fate of the black holes seeds formed up to the formation time of the quasar seed and what are the implications for the observed quasar luminosity function .",
    "we assume eddington accretion for the bh seeds , so that the evolution of the bh mass is given by : @xmath234},\\ ] ] where @xmath235 is the mass at formation time @xmath236 and @xmath237 is the salpeter time @xcite : @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the radiative efficiency .    using eq .",
    "[ eq : accr ] we can immediately see that a difference of @xmath240 , that is of @xmath241 at @xmath242 , in the formation epoch of the bh seed of a bright quasar is not too important in terms of the final mass that can be accreted by @xmath6 , as this corresponds to about half a folding time .",
    "assuming @xmath243 until @xmath244 , the highest redshift in the sdss quasar sample @xcite , we obtain a ratio of final to initial mass @xmath245 for @xmath246 and @xmath247 for @xmath242 . therefore in both cases",
    "there has been enough time to build up a @xmath248 supermassive black hole with mass @xmath249 starting from a popiii remnant .",
    "this estimate however highlights that only a minor fraction of the popiii bh seeds formed before @xmath242 can accrue mass with high efficiency , otherwise the number density of supermassive black holes at low redshift would greatly exceed the observational constraints .",
    "the first bh seeds in the box are distant from each other , so they evolve in relative isolation , without possibly merging among themselves . therefore other mechanisms must be responsible for quenching accretion of the first bh seeds . interestingly if we were to assume that accretion periods are poisson distributed in time for each seed , we would not be able to explain the observed power law distribution of bh masses at @xmath250 around the high mass end",
    ". a poisson distribution would in fact give too little scatter around the median value and a sharp ( faster than exponential ) decay of the displacements from the mean accreted mass .",
    "an exponential distribution of the accretion efficiency is instead required to match the observed bh mass function .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to assume that the duty cycle of the bh accretion is roughly proportional to the mass of the halo it resides in .",
    "this is sensible , since an accretion model unrelated to the hosting halo mass may lead to the unphysical result of possibly accruing more mass than the total baryon mass available in that halo .",
    "in fact , a bh seed formed at @xmath251 is within a halo of median mass @xmath106 at @xmath6 and a few percent of the seeds may be in halos with mass below @xmath252 at that redshift .    to explore this possibility",
    "we follow the merging history of popiii halos formed at @xmath242 by means of a merger - tree code based on @xcite .",
    "we implement a bh growth based on eq .",
    "[ eq : accr ] , but at each step of the tree we limit the bh mass to @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the total baryon mass of the halo that hosts the bh .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : accr ] . if the bh growth is not constrained ( or only mildly constrained ) , then a significant fraction of the seeds grows above @xmath255 , which would result in an unrealistic number density of supermassive black holes at @xmath6 .",
    "however , if @xmath256 ( like in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , then we obtain an expected mass for the bh powering bright @xmath6 quasar of @xmath257 , which is in agreement with the observational constraints from sdss quasars @xcite . by fitting a power law function to the bh mass function in the range @xmath258\\cdot 10^{10 } m_{\\sun}$ ]",
    "we obtain a slope @xmath259 , while the slope is @xmath9 in the mass range @xmath260 \\cdot 10^{10 } m_{\\sun}$ ] , a value that is consistent within the @xmath261 error bar with the slope of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function measured by @xcite .    another contribution to ease an overproduction of bright quasars",
    "may be given by the suppression of the early growth of the popiii bh seeds for the first @xmath262 after formation , that is for about @xmath263 @xcite .",
    "in fact the radiation from a popiii star may evacuate most of the gas from its host halo , so that the subsequent bh growth is quenched until a merger provides a new gas reservoir to enable growth at near eddington rate @xcite .",
    "also the bh seeds situated in more massive halos would probably be more likely to replentish their gas supply earlier .",
    "in this paper we investigate the link between the first popiii halos collapsed in a simulation box and the most massive structures at @xmath113 , with the aim of establishing the relationship between the first intermediate mass black holes created in the universe and the super - massive black holes that power the emission of bright @xmath6 quasars .",
    "we show that almost no correlation is present between the sites of formation of the first few hundred @xmath79 halos and the most massive halos at @xmath33 when the simulation box has an edge of several hundred @xmath264 . here",
    "the popiii progenitors ( halos of mass @xmath265 ) of massive halos at @xmath105 formed from density peaks that are @xmath266 more common than that of the _ first _ popiii star in the @xmath267 simulation box .",
    "these halos virialize around @xmath268 , to be compared with @xmath269 of the _ first _ popiii halo .",
    "this result has important consequences .",
    "we show that , if bright quasars and supermassive black holes live in the most massive halos at @xmath248 , then their progenitors at the @xmath270 mass scale are well within the popiii era , regardless of the popiii termination mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath271 relationship is already in place at @xmath6 , then bright quasars are not linked to the remnants of the very first intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) born in the universe , as their imbh progenitors form when already several thousands of popiii stars have been created within the typical volume that hosts a bright @xmath6 quasar .",
    "the imbh seeds planted by this very first popiii stars have sufficient time to grow up to @xmath272 \\cdot 10^{10 } m_{\\sun}$ ] by @xmath6 if we assume eddington accretion with radiative efficiency @xmath7 . instead , quenching of the bh accretion is required for the seeds of those popiii stars that will not end up in massive halos at @xmath6 , otherwise the number density of supermassive black holes would greatly exceed the observational constraints .",
    "one way to obtain growth consistent with the observations is to limit the accreted mass at a fraction @xmath256 of the total baryon halo mass .",
    "this gives a slope of the bh mass function @xmath273 in the bh mass range @xmath274 \\cdot 10^{10 } m_{\\sun}$ ] , which is within the @xmath261 uncertainty of the slope of the bright end of the @xmath6 quasar luminosity function ( @xmath275 ) measured by @xcite .",
    "another important point highlighted by this study is that rich clusters do not preferentially host the remnants of the first popiii stars .",
    "in fact the remnants of the first 100 pop - iii stars in our medium sized simulation box ( volume of @xmath267 ) end up at @xmath26 on halos that have a median mass of @xmath276 .",
    "this suggests caution in interpreting the results from studies that select a specific volume of the simulation box , like a rich cluster , and then progressively refine smaller and smaller regions with the aim of hunting for the first lights formed in the whole simulation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . only by considering refinements over the complete volume of the box",
    "the rarity and the formation ranking of these progenitors can be correctly evaluated .",
