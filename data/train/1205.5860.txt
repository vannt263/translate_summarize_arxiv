    "since the discovery @xcite of @xmath0 exceptional orthogonal polynomials ( here after eops ) in mathematical physics there has been renewed interest in the analysis of exactly solvable shape invariant quantum systems . unlike the classical orthogonal polynomials , these new polynomials have the remarkable properties @xcite that they still form complete sets with respect to some positive definite measure , although they start with degree @xmath2 polynomials instead of a constant .",
    "laguerre and jacobi - type @xmath0 eops have made their appearance in the bound state wave functions of the quantum systems with both constant @xcite and position - dependent mass @xcite .",
    "these quantum systems are shown @xcite , with the help of reducible second order supersymmetric transformation , to be rationally extended version of conventional ones associated with the classical orthogonal polynomials .",
    "this supersymmetric transformation also explains the isospectrality of the conventional and rationally extended potentials .",
    "subsequently , eops are generalized to higher co - dimension @xcite and to multi - indexed systems @xcite and associated shape invariant hamiltonians are reported @xcite .",
    "some properties of these polynomials are studied in ref .",
    "eops are also used in connection with discrete quantum mechanics @xcite , dirac and fokker - planck equations @xcite , pre - potential approach @xcite , information entropy @xcite , quantum hamilton jacobi formalism @xcite , dynamical breaking of higher order supersymmetry @xcite and quasi - exactly solvable problems @xcite .",
    "however , the application of these new polynomials to the non - hermitian quantum systems is not reported so far . + non - hermitian hamiltonians are important due to the fact that , despite being non - hermitian in nature , these operators may constitute unitary quantum mechanical systems @xcite . non - hermitian parity - time",
    "( @xmath3 ) symmetric hamiltonians possess real discrete energy eigenvalues if the corresponding eigenfunctions are also @xmath3 symmetric , otherwise the eigenvalues occur in complex conjugate pairs @xcite .",
    "@xmath4-symmetric hamiltonian having all eigenvalues real is connected to the existence of a positive definite inner product @xmath5 which render the hamiltonian @xmath6 to be pseudo - hermitian @xcite @xmath7 , where the hermitian linear automorphism @xmath8 is bounded and positive definite .",
    "another equivalent condition for the reality of the energy spectrum @xmath6 is the quasi - hermiticity @xcite , i.e. the existence of a invertible operator @xmath9 such that @xmath10 is hermitian with respect to usual inner product @xmath11 .",
    "quasi - hermitian hamiltonian shares the same energy spectrum of the equivalent hermitian hamiltonian @xmath12 and the wave functions are obtained by operating @xmath13 on those of @xmath12 .",
    "most of the analytically solvable non - hermitian hamiltonians are constructed by making the coupling constant of the known exactly solvable potentials imaginary @xcite . in some other cases",
    "@xcite , the coordinate is shifted with an imaginary constant .",
    "several of these classes of hamiltonians are argued to be pseudo - hermitian under @xmath14 @xcite . for a real @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the operator @xmath17 shifts the coordinate @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "+ the goal of this letter is to generate some rationally extended hamiltonians which are non - hermitian in nature and whose bound state solutions are associated with laguerre or jacobi - type @xmath0 exceptional orthogonal polynomials . by ` rationally extended hamiltonians ' we mean those which are the extensions of the well known hamiltonians by addition of some rational functions .",
    "the method of point canonical transformation ( pct ) @xcite , which consists of transformation of the initial schrdinger equation to a differential equation of some special function , has been used here to achieve our goal .",
    "the non - hermiticity enters , in a natural way , into the potentials through the purely imaginary constant of integration appears in pct .",
    "we also show , with the help of a similarity transformation , that the new non - hermitian hamiltonians obtained here are quasi as well as pseudo - hermitian .",
    "in particular , it has been identified that the positive definite operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 play the roles of a quasi and pseudo - hermitian operators respectively .",
    "here we use the method of pct to derive some exactly solvable non - hermitian hamiltonians whose bound state wave functions are associated with laguerre or jacobi type @xmath0 exceptional orthogonal polynomials . for this",
    "we first briefly recall the method of point canonical transformation .    in pct approach @xcite , the general solution of the schrdinger equation ( with @xmath22 )",
    "@xmath23 can be assumed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 satisfies the second order linear differential equation of a special function @xmath26 substituting the assumed solution @xmath27 in equation ( [ e1 ] ) and comparing the resulting equation with the equation ( [ e2 ] ) one obtains the following two equations for @xmath28 and @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    respectively .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations above two equations reduces to    @xmath32    @xmath33    now , we are in a position to choose the special function @xmath25 ( consequently @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the equation ( [ e3 ] ) becomes meaningful for a proper choice of @xmath36 ensuring the presence of a constant term in the right - hand side which connects the energy in the left - hand side .",
    "the remaining part of equation ( [ e3 ] ) gives the potential .",
    "corresponding bound state wave functions involving the special function @xmath25 are obtained with the help of equations ( [ e18 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) , as @xmath37 here , we choose the special function to be the exceptional @xmath0 laguerre polynomial viz , @xmath38 . for real @xmath39 and @xmath40 , these polynomials",
    "@xmath41 satisfy the differential equation @xcite @xmath42 the polynomial @xmath41 has one zero in @xmath43 , remaining @xmath44 zeros lie in @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , these polynomials are orthonormal @xcite with respect to the rational weight @xmath46 @xmath47 the expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , corresponding to the choice @xmath48 , are given by @xmath49 using them in equation ( [ e3 ] ) , we have the expression for @xmath50 as @xmath51 at this point we choose @xmath52 , which is satisfied by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an arbitrary constant of integration . here",
    "two cases may arise , namely , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . without loss of generality we can choose , for the moment , @xmath55 .",
    "for this choice , substituting @xmath36 in equation ( [ e4 ] ) and separating out the potential and the energy , we have @xmath57 the potential @xmath58 is singularity free in the interval @xmath59 .",
    "the same potential has earlier been reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the potential @xmath58 is the extension of the standard radial oscillator by addition of last two rational terms .",
    "such terms do not change the behavior of the potential for large values of @xmath18 , while small values of @xmath18 produce some drastic effect on the minima of the potential .",
    "the normalized wave functions corresponding to the potential can be determined , in terms of laguerre @xmath0 eops , using equations ( [ e24 ] ) , ( [ e28 ] ) and ( [ e27 ] ) , as @xmath60 it is worth mentioning here that the choice @xmath55 in equation ( [ e29 ] ) always gives rise to hermitian potential .",
    "nonzero real values of @xmath54 do not make any significant difference in the potential and its solutions .",
    "the non - hermiticity can be invoked into the potential only if @xmath54 is purely imaginary .",
    "we set @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for which the potential reduces to @xmath64 ^ 2}\\label{e33}\\ ] ]    the above non - hermitian potential is free from singularity through out the whole real @xmath18 axis .",
    "since the energy @xmath65 has no dependence on @xmath54 , the non - hermitian potential @xmath66 also shares the same real energy spectrum of @xmath58 .",
    "this requires further explanation . in the following ,",
    "we show that the potential @xmath66 is actually quasi - hermitian . for this",
    "we define the operator @xmath67 which has the following properties @xmath68 in other words , the operator @xmath9 has an effect of shifting the coordinate @xmath18 to @xmath69 . for the proof of the results ( [ e6 ] ) ,",
    "readers are advised to follow the reference @xcite . for this operator",
    "we have the following similarity transformation @xmath70 this ensures that the non - hermitian hamiltonian corresponding to the potential @xmath66 is quasi - hermitian .",
    "the equivalent hermitian potential @xmath58 , which corresponds to @xmath55 , is given in equation ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "it is very easy to show that the positive definite operator @xmath21 satisfies @xmath71 ensuring the potential to be pseudo - hermitian .",
    "the potential @xmath66 also satisfies @xmath72 and hence is @xmath4-symmetric .",
    "the wave functions of the potential @xmath66 can be determined by @xmath73 .",
    "+ in figure [ f1a ] , we have shown the real and imaginary parts of the potential @xmath66 given in ( [ e33 ] ) , while figure [ f1b ] shows its equivalent hermitian analogue @xmath58 given in ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "using first two members of exceptional @xmath0 laguerre polynomials @xmath74 , we have also plotted in figure [ f1b ] the absolute value of first two wave functions given in ( [ e34 ] ) .",
    "next we choose @xmath25 to be jacobi - type @xmath0 eop , @xmath75 , which is defined for real @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "in this case the expression for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by @xcite @xmath79 using these expressions in ( [ e3 ] ) and choosing @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 like the exceptional laguerre polynomials , the choice @xmath55 gives rise to the potential , energies and corresponding bound state wave functions , as @xmath82 ^ 2},\\\\ \\\\",
    "e_n = \\frac{k^2}{4 } ( 2 n + a + b -1)^2 , \\end{array}\\label{e8}\\ ] ] and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "the above periodic potential @xmath58 , which is free from singularity in the interval @xmath84 , can be interpreted @xcite as the rational extension of the standard trigonometric scarf potential which is associated with classical jacobi polynomials .",
    "the wave functions in equation ( [ e39 ] ) are regular @xcite iff @xmath85 .",
    "+    [ myfigure ]    here , the non - hermitian potential corresponding to the choice @xmath61 is obtained as @xmath86}{\\left[a+b - ( b - a ) \\sin ( k x + i \\epsilon ) \\right]^2 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] this potential @xmath66 , which is defined on whole real line , also shares the same real eigenvalues of the potential given in ( [ e8 ] ) . like the rationally extended radial oscillator the above non - hermitian potential is also quasi - hermitian under the the operator @xmath9 defined in ( [ e9 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding equivalent analogue is the one given in equation ( [ e8 ] ) which corresponds to the choice @xmath55 .",
    "the potential @xmath66 also fulfills the requirement of @xmath4-symmetry i.e. @xmath72 , only if @xmath87 .",
    "however , if we consider the other solution @xmath88 of @xmath89 , the corresponding potential @xmath66 becomes @xmath4-symmetric for all real values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the wave functions of @xmath66 can be determined by operating @xmath13 on @xmath92 given in ( [ e39 ] ) . here , we have not considered the complex values of @xmath93 because this will give rise to the exceptional jacobi polynomials with complex indices and complex arguments .",
    "the orthogonality properties for such complex polynomials may depend on the interplay between integration contour and parameter values . + in figure [ f2a ] , we have plotted the real and imaginary parts of the potential @xmath66 . the corresponding equivalent hermitian analogue @xmath58 and square of its first two wave functions are plotted in figure [ f2b ] .",
    "we have used the expression of first two members of jacobi type @xmath0 eops , @xmath94 and @xmath95 to plot the square of the wave functions . +",
    "in summary , we have generated some exactly solvable non - hermitian hamiltonians whose bound state wave functions are associated with laguerre and jacobi - type @xmath0 exceptional orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the hamiltonians are shown , with the help of imaginary shift of coordinate , to be both quasi and pseudo - hermitian .",
    "the imaginary shift of the coordinate enables us to make the potentials singularity free throughout the whole real axis .",
    "the obtained potentials enlarge the class of analytically solvable non - hermitian potentials .",
    "in addition , the non - hermitian rationally extended trigonometric scarf potential might has potential application in @xmath4-symmetric optical lattice @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted here that the other choices of @xmath36 in the expression @xmath50 associated with laguerre and jacobi eops give rise to the several other exactly solvable hermitian as well as quasi - hermitian extended potentials .",
    "but in all these cases we have to redefine the parameters carefully so that @xmath96 dependent term appears only in the constant energy .",
    "we emphasize that analogous study @xcite can be made to the case of solvable hamiltonians associated with exceptional orthogonal polynomials of higher co - dimension and multi - indexed polynomials .",
