    "a few years ago , fomin and zelevinsky introduced the concept of cluster algebras @xcite which rapidly became a successful research area .",
    "cluster algebras nowadays link various areas of mathematics , like combinatorics , lie theory , algebraic geometry , representation theory , integrable systems , teichmller theory , poisson geometry and also string theory in physics ( via recent work on quivers with superpotentials @xcite , @xcite ) .    in an attempt to categorify cluster algebras , which a priori are combinatorially defined ,",
    "cluster categories have been introduced by buan , marsh , reineke , reiten and todorov @xcite . for a quiver @xmath2 without loops and oriented 2-cycles and the corresponding path algebra @xmath3 ( over an algebraically closed field @xmath4 ) , the cluster category @xmath5 is the orbit category of the bounded derived category @xmath6 by the functor @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 denotes the auslander - reiten translation and @xmath9 $ ] is the shift functor on the triangulated category @xmath6 .",
    "important objects in cluster categories are the cluster - tilting objects .",
    "the endomorphism algebras of such objects in the cluster category @xmath5 are called cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "cluster tilted algebras have several interesting properties , e.g. their representation theory can be completely understood in terms of the representation theory of the corresponding path algebra of a quiver ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these algebras have been studied by various authors , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .    in recent years , a focal point in the representation theory of algebras has been the investigation of derived equivalences of algebras . since a lot of properties and invariants of rings and algebras",
    "are preserved by derived equivalences , it is important for many purposes to classify classes of algebras up to derived equivalence , instead of morita equivalence . for selfinjective algebras",
    "the representation type is preserved under derived equivalences ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it has been also proved in @xcite that the class of symmetric algebras is closed under derived equivalences .",
    "additionally , we note that derived equivalent algebras have the same number of pairwise nonisomorphic simple modules and isomorphic centers .    in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with the problem of derived equivalence classification of cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath0 .",
    "such a classification was done for cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath10 by buan and vatne in @xmath11 @xcite ; see also the work of murphy on the more general case of @xmath12-cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "since the quivers of cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath0 are exactly the quivers in the mutation classes of @xmath0 , our first aim in this paper is to give a description of the mutation classes of @xmath13quivers ; these mutation classes are known to be finite ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "the second purpose of this note is to describe , when two cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath2 have equivalent derived categories , where @xmath2 is a quiver whose underlying graph is @xmath0 .",
    "in definition [ description_mutation_class ] we present a class @xmath14 of quivers with @xmath15 vertices which includes all non - oriented cycles of length @xmath15 . to show that this class contains all quivers mutation equivalent to some quiver of type @xmath0 we first prove that this class is closed under quiver mutation .",
    "furthermore , we define parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 for any quiver @xmath18 in definition [ parameters ] and prove that every quiver in @xmath14 with parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be mutated to a normal form , see figure  [ normal_form ] , without changing the parameters .",
    "with the help of the above result we can show that every quiver @xmath18 with parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 is mutation equivalent to some non - oriented cycle with @xmath19 arrows in one direction and @xmath20 arrows in the other direction .",
    "hence , if two quivers @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xmath14 have the parameters @xmath23 , respectively @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( or vice versa ) , then @xmath21 is mutation equivalent to @xmath22 .    the converse of this result",
    ", i.e. , an explicit description of the mutation classes of quivers of type @xmath0 , can be shown with the help of lemma @xmath26 in @xcite .",
    "the main result of the derived equivalence classification of cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath0 is the following theorem :    * theorem [ main_result ] . * two cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath0 are derived equivalent if and only if their quivers have the same parameters @xmath27 and @xmath17 ( up to changing the roles of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "we prove that every cluster tilted algebra of type @xmath0 with parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 is derived equivalent to a cluster tilted algebra corresponding to a quiver in normal form .",
    "furthermore , we compute the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath17 as combinatorial derived invariants for a quiver @xmath18 with the help of an algorithm defined by avella - alaminos and gei  in @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we collect some basic notions about quiver mutations . in section 3",
    "we present the set @xmath14 of quivers which can be obtained by iterated mutation from quivers whose underlying graph is of type @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we describe , when two quivers of @xmath14 are in the same mutation class . in the fourth section",
    "we describe the cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath0 and their relations ( as shown in @xcite ) . in section 5",
    "we first briefly review the fundamental results on derived equivalences .",
    "afterwards , we prove our main result , i.e. , we show , when two cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath0 are derived equivalent .    * acknowledgement .",
    "* the author would like to thank thorsten holm for many helpful suggestions and discussions about the topics of this work .    .",
    "first , we present the basic notions for quiver mutations .",
    "a _ quiver _ is a finite directed graph @xmath2 , consisting of a finite set of vertices @xmath31 and a finite set of arrows @xmath21 between them .",
    "let @xmath2 be a quiver and @xmath4 be an algebraically closed field .",
    "we can form the _ path algebra _ @xmath3 , where the basis of @xmath3 is given by all paths in @xmath2 , including trivial paths @xmath32 of length zero at each vertex @xmath33 of @xmath2 .",
    "multiplication in @xmath3 is defined by concatenation of paths .",
    "our convention is to read paths from right to left . for any path @xmath34 in @xmath2 let @xmath35 denote its start vertex and @xmath36 its end vertex .",
    "then the product of two paths @xmath34 and @xmath37 is defined to be the concatenated path @xmath38 if @xmath39 . the unit element of @xmath3 is the sum of all trivial paths , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "we now recall the definition of _ quiver mutation _ which was introduced by fomin and zelevinsky in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a quiver without loops and oriented @xmath41-cycles .",
    "the _ mutation _ of @xmath2 at a vertex @xmath42 to a new quiver @xmath43 can be described as follows :    1 .",
    "add a new vertex @xmath44 .",
    "if there are @xmath45 arrows @xmath46 , @xmath47 arrows @xmath48 and @xmath49 arrows @xmath50 in @xmath2 , there are @xmath51 arrows @xmath50 in @xmath43 .",
    "( here , a negative number of arrows means arrows in the opposite direction . )",
    "3 .   for any vertex @xmath33 replace all arrows from @xmath33 to @xmath42 with arrows from @xmath44 to @xmath33 , and replace all arrows from @xmath42 to @xmath33 with arrows from @xmath33 to @xmath44 .",
    "4 .   remove the vertex @xmath42 .",
    "note that mutation at sinks or sources only means changing the direction of all incoming or outgoing arrows .",
    "two quivers are called _ mutation equivalent _ ( _ sink / source equivalent _ ) if one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of mutations ( at sinks and/or sources ) .",
    "the _ mutation class _ of a quiver @xmath2 is the class of all quivers mutation equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "quivers of type @xmath0 are just cycles with @xmath15 vertices . if the cycle is oriented , then we get the mutation class of @xmath52 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or type iv in type @xmath53 in @xcite ) .",
    "if the cycle is non - oriented , we get what we call the mutation classes of @xmath0 .",
    "first , we have to fix one drawing of this non - oriented cycle , i.e. , one embedding into the plane .",
    "thus , we can speak of clockwise and anti - clockwise oriented arrows .",
    "but we have to consider that this notation is only unique up to reflection of the cycle , i.e. , up to changing the roles of clockwise and anti - clockwise oriented arrows .",
    "[ fomin , shapiro and thurston , lemma 6.8 in @xcite ] [ mutation_equivalence ] let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be two non - oriented cycles , so that in @xmath54 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) there are @xmath56 ( resp .",
    "@xmath57 ) arrows oriented in the clockwise direction and @xmath58 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 ) arrows oriented in the anti - clockwise direction . then @xmath54 and @xmath55 are mutation equivalent if and only if the unordered pairs @xmath60 and @xmath61 coincide .",
    "next we will provide an explicit description of the mutation classes of @xmath13quivers .",
    "for this we need a description of the mutation class of quivers of type @xmath62 and we use the following one which is given in @xcite :    * each quiver has @xmath42 vertices , * all non - trivial cycles are oriented and of length 3 , * a vertex has at most four incident arrows , * if a vertex has four incident arrows , then two of them belong to one oriented @xmath63-cycle , and the other two belong to another oriented @xmath63-cycle , * if a vertex has three incident arrows , then two of them belong to an oriented @xmath63-cycle , and the third arrow does not belong to any oriented @xmath63-cycle .    by a _ cycle _ in the first condition we mean a cycle in the underlying graph , not passing through the same edge twice .",
    "in particular , this condition excludes multiple arrows .",
    "note that another description of the mutation class of quivers of type @xmath64 is given in @xcite .",
    "* there exists precisely one full subquiver which is a non - oriented cycle of length @xmath65 .",
    "thus , if the length is two , it is a double arrow .",
    "* for each arrow @xmath66 in this non - oriented cycle , there may ( or may not ) be a vertex @xmath67 which is not on the non - oriented cycle , such that there is an oriented @xmath63-cycle of the form +    + apart from the arrows of these oriented @xmath63-cycles there are no other arrows incident to vertices on the non - oriented cycle . *",
    "if we remove all vertices in the non - oriented cycle and their incident arrows , the result is a disconnected union of quivers @xmath68 , one for each @xmath67 ( which we call @xmath69 in the following ) .",
    "these are quivers of type @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and the vertices @xmath67 have at most two incident arrows in these quivers .",
    "furthermore , if a vertex @xmath67 has two incident arrows in such a quiver , then @xmath67 is a vertex in an oriented @xmath63-cycle in @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath33 is a vertex in one of the quivers @xmath73 of type @xmath64 , but not one of the vertices @xmath67 connecting this quiver of type @xmath64 to the rest of the quiver @xmath2 , then the mutation at @xmath33 leads to a quiver @xmath74 since type @xmath64 is closed under quiver mutation .",
    "\\1 ) let @xmath33 be one of the vertices @xmath67 , i.e. , not on the non - oriented cycle .",
    "for the situation where the quiver of type @xmath64 attached to @xmath67 consists only of one vertex , we can look at the first mutated quiver in case 2 ) below since quiver mutation is an involution .",
    "thus , we have the following three cases ,                    then the mutation at @xmath33 leads to the following three quivers which have a non - oriented cycle one arrow longer than for @xmath2 , and this is indeed a non - oriented cycle since the arrows @xmath75 have the same orientation as @xmath34 before .                    the vertices @xmath76 and @xmath12 have at most two incident arrows in the quivers @xmath21 and @xmath22 since they had at most four resp .",
    "three incident arrows in @xmath2 ( see the description of quivers of type @xmath64 ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath76 or @xmath12 has two incident arrows in the quiver @xmath21 or @xmath22 , then these two arrows form an oriented @xmath63-cycle as in @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the mutated quiver @xmath43 is also in @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath33 is a sink or a source in @xmath2 , the non - oriented cycle in @xmath43 is of the same length as before and @xmath43 is in @xmath14 .",
    "if there is a path @xmath75 in @xmath2 , then the mutation at @xmath33 leads to a quiver @xmath43 which has a non - oriented cycle one arrow shorter than in @xmath2 .",
    "note that in this case the non - oriented cycle in @xmath2 consists of at least three arrows and thus , the non - oriented cycle in @xmath43 has at least two arrows .",
    "thus , the mutated quiver @xmath43 is also in @xmath14 .",
    "\\3 ) let @xmath33 be a vertex on the non - oriented cycle which is part of exactly one oriented @xmath63-cycle .",
    "then four cases can occur , but two of them have been dealt with by the second and third mutated quiver in case 1 ) since quiver mutation is an involution .",
    "thus , we only have to consider the following two situations and their special cases where the non - oriented cycle is a double arrow .",
    "\\4 ) let @xmath33 be a vertex on the non - oriented cycle which is part of two oriented @xmath63-cycles .",
    "then three cases can occur , but one of them has been dealt with by the first mutated quiver in case 1 ) .",
    "thus , we only have to consider the following two situations and their special cases where the non - oriented cycle is a double arrow .",
    "it is easy to see that all orientations of a circular quiver of type @xmath0 are in @xmath14 ( except the oriented case ; but this leads to the mutation class of @xmath52 ) .",
    "since @xmath14 is closed under quiver mutation every quiver mutation equivalent to some quiver of type @xmath0 is in @xmath14 , too .",
    "now we fix one drawing of a quiver @xmath18 , i.e. , one embedding into the plane , without arrow - crossing .",
    "thus , we can again speak of clockwise and anti - clockwise oriented arrows of the non - oriented cycle .",
    "but we have to consider that this notation is only unique up to reflection of the non - oriented cycle , i.e. , up to changing the roles of clockwise and anti - clockwise oriented arrows .",
    "we define four parameters @xmath27 and @xmath17 for a quiver @xmath18 as follows :      1 .",
    "these arrows are part of the non - oriented cycle and they are oriented in the anti - clockwise direction , see the left picture of figure  [ parameter1 ] .",
    "these arrows are not part of the non - oriented cycle , but they are attached to an oriented @xmath63-cycle @xmath79 which shares one arrow @xmath34 with the non - oriented cycle and @xmath34 is oriented in the anti - clockwise direction , see the right picture of figure  [ parameter1 ] .",
    "+ in this sense , attached means that these arrows are part of the quiver @xmath69 of type @xmath64 which shares the vertex @xmath67 with the cycle @xmath79 ( see definition [ description_mutation_class ] ) .      1 .",
    "these cycles share one arrow @xmath34 with the non - oriented cycle and @xmath34 is oriented in the anti - clockwise direction , see the left picture of figure  [ parameter2 ] .",
    "these cycles are attached to an oriented @xmath63-cycle @xmath79 sharing one arrow @xmath34 with the non - oriented cycle and @xmath34 is oriented in the anti - clockwise direction , see the right picture of figure  [ parameter2 ] . here , attached is in the same sense as above .",

    "if @xmath64 is derived equivalent to @xmath90 , we know from theorem [ phi_invariant ] that @xmath91 and thus , that the parameters are the same . otherwise , if @xmath64 and @xmath90 have the same parameters , they are both derived equivalent to the same cluster tilted algebra with a quiver in normal form ."
