    "we also refer to the theoretical approach in @xcite , which is based on the grain boundary character distribution .    however , it remains a challenge to establish such universal long - time asymptotics in mathematical models and it is often difficult to prove only the existence of self - similar solutions . in this article",
    "we investigate the existence of self - similar solutions to a kinetic mean - field model that has been suggested by fradkov @xcite to describe grain growth in two dimensions .",

    "the evolution of such a network by mean curvature is well  defined @xcite until two vertices on a grain boundary collide , after which topological rearrangements may take place .",
    "if an edge vanishes an unstable fourfold vertex is produced , which immediately splits up again such that two new vertices are connected by a new edge . as a consequence two neighbouring grains decrease their topological class ( i.e. , the number of edges ) , whereas the other two grains increase it ( fig .",

    "we define the moments @xmath57 and refer to @xmath58 as the polyhedral defect and the area of a self - similar solution , respectively .",

    "these main assertions can be supplemented by the following remarks .    1 .",
    "since @xmath74 depends on @xmath75 homogeneously of order @xmath76 , the set of self - similar solutions is invariant under scalings @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "therefore we can normalize self - similar solutions by prescribing the area .",

    "we also establish further regularity results that characterize the behaviour of @xmath59 near @xmath65 , see lemma [ lem : nearsingularities ] , and find for large @xmath3 that @xmath59 is continuous also at @xmath65 .",

    "is inspired by the existence proof for self - similar solutions to coagulation equations in @xcite . in section [ s.discretemodel ]",
