    "quantum correlations , entanglement and quantum discord ( qd ) , represent a valuable resource for information processing and technology @xcite . in turn , the dynamics of quantum correlations have been investigated for several systems , ranging from quantum optics  @xcite to nanophysics  @xcite . the major limitation of the use of entanglement and qd in practical applications is due to the unavoidable interaction of real quantum systems with their surroundings , resulting in decoherence processes , and , as a consequence , in the degradation of quantum correlations . on the other hand , the environment can even resume or preserve quantum correlations , as it happens when the backflow of information to the system becomes relevant .",
    "it is therefore of interest to understand the effect of the various kinds of environmental noise on the dynamics of quantum correlations in realistic quantum systems , where peculiar phenomena can be observed , such as sudden death and revival  @xcite . in particular , it is crucial to investigate and compare markovian noise , ascribed to environment with short self - correlations  @xcite , to non - markovian noise  @xcite , which is associated to environments with memory and may lead to a non - monotonic time dependence of entanglement and qd .",
    "revival phenomena have been predicted both for couple of qubits interacting directly or indirectly in a common quantum reservoir  @xcite and for non - interacting qubits in independent non - markovian quantum environments.@xcite .",
    "the effect of the quantum noise on the entanglement dynamics between two quantum systems has been interpreted in terms of the transfer of the correlations back and forth from the systems themselves to the environment .",
    "this is due to the back - action of the system on the environment . on the other hand , recently , revivals of quantum correlations have been found also for quantum systems coupled to classical sources  @xcite and have been connected to a quantifier of non - markovianity for the dynamics of a single - qubit .",
    "it was actually proven that a classical noise can mimic a quantum environment not affected by the system or influenced in a way that does not result in a back - action .    in this work",
    "we analyze the role played by classical environments , characterized by @xmath0 noise spectra , on the dynamics of quantum correlations . in particular , as prototypical bipartite system , we consider two non - interacting qubits coupled to noise in different environments",
    ". noises of the type @xmath0 are among the main sources of decoherence in quantum solid - state devices  @xcite , thus constituting a fundamental case of study for a deeper understanding of the decoherence process itself .",
    "this kind of noise spectra stem from a collection of random telegraph sources with a specific distribution of their switching rates .",
    "for @xmath2 the so - called pink @xmath3 noise is found , which is obtained from a set of random telegraph fluctuators weighted by the inverse of the switching rate .",
    "another interesting case is the @xmath4 spectrum , also called brown noise from its relation to a brownian motion .",
    "we study the dynamics of quantum correlations as a function of the parameter @xmath5 and observe a continuous variation in their bahavior , ranging from the monotonic decay characteristic of the @xmath3 noise to the phenomena of sadden death and revivals induced by the @xmath4 noise . while a qualitative trend is clearly identified , it is not possible to identify a precise threshold value between the decaying and the oscillating regime , since the outcomes significantly depend upon the range of selected frequencies and upon the number of random telegraph fluctuators used for the calculations .",
    "the dynamics of the two quits is ruled by a stochastic hamiltonian with time dependent coupling .",
    "the average of the time - evolved states over the switching parameters describes the evolution of the two - qubit state under the effect of the noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the definition of negativity , as a measure of entanglement , and of qd are briefly reviewed .",
    "the physical model adopted is described in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv results are presented and discussed , whereas section [ s : out ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "entanglement is evaluated by means of negativity , defined as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density matrix of the system .",
    "negativity is zero for separable states and assumes value one for maximally entangled states .",
    "qd is defined as the difference between the total and the classical correlations in a system @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the quantum mutual information @xmath10 , quantifying the total correlations in a system , @xmath11 is the von neumann entropy , and @xmath12 indicates the reduced density matrix of the subsystem @xmath13 , @xmath14 denotes the measurement - induced quantum mutual information , namely the classical correlations , and reads @xmath15 , with @xmath16 that denotes the quantum conditional entropy with respect to the set of projective measurements @xmath17 performed locally on subsystem @xmath18 .",
    "usually to compute qd is not an easy task , since it involves a maximization procedure .",
    "however , for two - qubit systems described by a density matrix with a so called `` x '' form , an analytical expression for @xmath19 has been obtained @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of two non - interacting qubits , initially entangled , subject to a noisy classical environment with noise spectra of the type @xmath0 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the environment is modelled by using different configurations of bistable fluctuators .",
    "the two qubits are initially prepared in the bell state @xmath21 . here",
    "the interaction between the qubits and the environment is assumed local , i.e. the two qubits interact with two different and independent baths .",
    "the case of a common environment affecting both qubits and its comparison with the local model is discussed in  @xcite . setting @xmath22 and adopting the spin notation ,",
    "the two - qubit hamiltonian describing the interaction with a single fluctuator is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the hamiltonian of a single qubit subject to a classical time - dependent noise which affects the transition amplitude parameter @xmath25 : @xmath26 with @xmath27 the qubit energy in absence of noise ( energy degeneracy is assumed ) , @xmath28 the identity matrix for subspace @xmath13 , @xmath29 is the coupling constant between the system and the environment , @xmath30 the pauli matrix . if the time - dependent coefficient @xmath25 can randomly flip between two values @xmath31 with a fixed rate @xmath32 ,",
