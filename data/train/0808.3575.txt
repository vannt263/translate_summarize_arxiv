    "in a previous paper @xcite we have motivated and studied the hamiltonian thermodynamics of three - dimensional dilatonic black holes . to construct a classical hamiltonian formalism",
    "is important for several reasons .",
    "first , it is always elegant to write the equations of the theory as a pair of symmetric first order equations .",
    "second , if one can put the classical theory into a hamiltonian form , then by applying certain rules one can get a quantized version of the theory in a first approximation .",
    "third , through euclideanization of the schrdinger time evolution operator @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian , one gets the partition function , which in turn leads to a thermodynamical decription of the system .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian formalism and the thermodynamical description are linked subjects .",
    "the hamiltonian thermodynamics of several different black hole systems have been studied first by louko and whiting in @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the louko - whiting method relies on the hamiltonian approach of @xcite , which in turn is an important ramification of the arnowitt , deser , and misner approach , the adm approach , and its major developments @xcite .",
    "other methods , like direct calculation from quantum fields in curved spacetime ( see , e.g , @xcite ) , or path integral methods ( see , e.g ,",
    "@xcite ) , have been used to study the thermodynamics of black holes .",
    "now , the study of thermodynamics of black holes in any specific dimension is important , for instance , to understand universal properties independent of the dimension itself . in particular , one can single out three dimensions as an adequate interesting dimension , because three dimensional general relativity has a special black hole with simple properties @xcite , and dilatonic extensions of this theory have black holes with properties similar to four - dimensional general relativistic black holes @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to generalize our previous work on hamiltonian thermodynamics of three - dimensional dilatonic black holes @xcite , to black holes , still in three dimensions , in which the graviton - dilaton brans - dicke theory , with its @xmath0 parameter , is coupled to a gauge field , namely , the electromagnetic field .",
    "three - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with its black hole solution has been studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and electric dilatonic extensions also have charged black holes @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "further analyses on the properties of these black holes have been worked out in @xcite . in principle",
    ", @xmath0 can take any value , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "but , since we want to perform a canonical hamiltonian analysis , using an adm formalism supplied with proper boundary conditions , it is necessary to pick up only those @xmath0s which yield black hole solutions that fulfill boundary conditions adequate to a hamiltonain method .",
    "as in the uncharged case @xcite , the cases of most interest are then black holes for which @xmath15 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "now , unlike the uncharged case , it was realized in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the inclusion of electric charge creates a complication to the definition of the mass @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath6 , which includes the general relativity case ( since it can be considered as the @xmath16 limit ) , one finds a divergent asymptotic behavior of the mass .",
    "this problem can be cured by a proper mass renormalization @xcite .",
    "but the whole issue has never been confronted when one makes a full use of the hamiltonian formalism , as we do here .",
    "we solve this difficulty and show that the mass redefinition conforms wholly with the formalism for the @xmath17 case , is not needed in the @xmath2 case and it is compatible with the @xmath3 case . in each case",
    ", the black hole system and its thermodynamics can then be studied .",
    "we have chosen to study the systems in a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "in such an ensemble , the boundary radius @xmath18 , the temperature @xmath19 ( or its inverse @xmath20 ) , and the electric potential ( i.e. , the chemical potential ) @xmath21 at the boundary radius are fixed .",
    "the electric potential is conjugate to the electric charge and , in this ensemble , the charge itself is not fixed .",
    "our main results are , a complete derivation from a hamiltonian formalism of the mass - energy @xmath22 , the entropy @xmath23 , and the charge @xmath24 , as well as the establishment that the grand canonical ensemble for charged three dimensional black holes is locally stable for the black holes studied .",
    "thus , the choice of such an ensemble is appropriate , since the corresponding boundary onditions lead to a well posed problem and a stable ensemble .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ solucoes ] we present the classical solutions of the three - dimensional dilatonic charged black holes , whose quantization through hamiltonian methods we will perform .",
    "there is a free parameter @xmath0 for which we choose three different values , @xmath25 , corresponding to the btz black hole , the dimensionally reduce four - dimensional cylindrical black hole , and a three - dimensional dilatonic black hole , respectively .",
    "we also introduce the spacetime foliation through which we will define the canonical coordinates and which will allow us to write the action as a sum of constraints multiplied by their respective lagrange multipliers .",
    "then , follow three sections , secs .",
    "[ mtz ] , [ zero ] , and [ menostres ] , where we develop the thermodynamic hamiltonian formalism for the @xmath25 charged black holes , respectively .",
    "we divide each section into a - f subsections to better analyze the hamiltonian thermodynamics of the systems .",
    "three - dimensional theories which contain black holes have been studied in several works . indeed in @xcite , a brans - dicke action , with gravitational and dilaton fields plus a cosmological constant , was used to study such solutions .",
    "now , we can couple the graviton and dilaton fields to an electromagnetic field . in order",
    "to find charged black hole solutions in three dimensions . for three - dimensional general relativity",
    "this has been done in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , whereas for brans - dicke theory this has been done in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the brans - dicke action with a maxwell term is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the determinant of the three - dimensional metric @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the curvature scalar , @xmath30 is a scalar dilaton field , @xmath0 is the brans - dicke parameter , @xmath31 is the cosmological constant , @xmath32 is the maxwell tensor , where @xmath33 is the vector potential one - form , and @xmath34 is a generic surface term . a general solution is a solution for the metric , the dilaton and the gauge field .",
    "we search for static solutions .",
    "the solution for the metric is then @xcite @xmath35   dt^2 + \\frac{dr^2}{(ar)^2 -   \\frac{b}{(ar)^{\\frac{1}{\\omega+1 } } } +   \\frac{k\\chi^2}{(ar)^{\\frac{2}{\\omega+1}}}}+   r^2 d\\varphi^2 , \\,\\,\\,\\ , \\omega\\neq-2\\,,-\\frac{3}{2}\\,,-1\\ , ,   \\label{solutions_1}\\\\   ds^2 & = & -\\left[\\left(1+\\frac{\\chi^2}{4}\\ln r \\right)r^2-br \\right ] dt^2 +   \\frac{dr^2}{\\left(1+\\frac{\\chi^2}{4}\\ln r \\right)r^2-br }   + r^2 d\\varphi^2 \\qquad \\qquad \\quad \\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\omega=-2\\,,\\\\   ds^2 & = & \\left(4\\lambda^2 r^2 \\ln(br ) + \\chi^2 r^4\\right ) dt^2   - \\frac{dr^2}{4\\lambda^2 r^2 \\ln(br ) + \\chi^2 r^4}+   r^2 d\\varphi^2 ,   \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\ ,   \\omega=-\\frac{3}{2}\\,,\\\\   ds^2 & = & -dt^2 + dr^2 + d\\varphi^2 , \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad   \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad   \\,\\,\\,\\ , \\omega=-1 ,   \\label{mink } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath37 is a constant related to the cosmological constant ( see below ) , and @xmath38 is a constant of integration related to the mass ( see below ) , @xmath39 is constant of integration related to the electric charge , and @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 .",
    "the general solution for @xmath30 is given by @xmath42 the general solution for the vector potential @xmath43 , written as @xmath44 , is given by @xmath45 for the constant @xmath37 one has @xmath46 for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 , which means that , unlike for the uncharged case , the cosmological constant is not null .",
    "the constant @xmath38 is related to the adm mass of the solutions by @xmath49 the constant @xmath39 is s related to the adm charge of the solutions by @xmath50 for @xmath51 , there is no good definition for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "since we want to perform a canonical hamiltonian analysis , using an adm formalism supplied with proper boundary conditions , it is necessary to pick up only those solutions that fulfill the conditions we want to impose .",
    "first , we are interested only in solutions with horizons , so we take @xmath38 to be positive .",
    "second , apart from a measure zero of solutions , all solutions have a non - zero @xmath52 .",
    "this does not mean straight away that the solutions are asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "some have one type or another of singularities at infinity , which do not allow an imposition of proper boundary conditions .",
    "so , from @xcite with the corresponding carter - penrose diagrams we discard the following solutions : @xmath53 which is simply the minkowski solution , @xmath54 since it has a curvature singularity at @xmath55 , which is inside the horizon , and has a null topological singularity at @xmath56 , @xmath57 since all the carter - penrose boundary is singular , the same happening in the interval @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the cases of interest to be studied are black holes for which @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for @xmath38",
    "positive these solutions have adm mass @xmath5 positive . as in @xcite",
    "we choose three typical amenable cases where an analytical study can be done .",
    "the first case is the charged btz black hole @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which can be found by taking appropriately the limit @xmath1 .",
    "this black hole is thus a solution of the einstein - maxwell action in three dimensions .",
    "the other cases are @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the theory with @xmath2 is equivalent to cylindrical four - dimensional einstein - maxwell general relativity , and the corresponding charge black hole was found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the theory with @xmath3 is just a case of 3d charged brans - dicke theory , with a black hole solution that can be analyzed in this context @xcite .",
    "now , as mentioned in the introduction , the definition of the adm mass @xmath5 is not straightforward when there is electric charge , in the sense that one can face a divergent asymptotic behavior of the mass @xmath5 , see @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "the problem is more acute when @xmath6 , which includes the general relativity case ( since general relativity can be considered the @xmath16 ) , see @xcite for a full discussion ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for such @xmath0 , the mass @xmath5 can be written as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mass for the uncharged case and @xmath63 is the divergent part when there is charge . to treat this divergence ,",
    "as explained in @xcite , we consider a large radius @xmath64 frontier .",
    "then we write the mass @xmath5 as @xmath65\\ , ,   \\label{mass_ren } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath66 is equal to @xmath67 the term in square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ mass_ren ] ) tends to zero as the radius @xmath29 tends to the frontier radius , @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath66 is interpreted as the energy inside the radius @xmath64 . from eq .",
    "( [ mass_uncharged ] ) the term @xmath69 is interpreted as the energy outside the frontier in @xmath64 , apart from an infinite constant , which is hidden in @xmath66 . the total mass definition , @xmath5 ,",
    "is then well defined . in practical terms",
    ", one needs not pay attention to the divergent factors @xmath70 because all one needs to do is consider null the asymptotic limits , @xmath71 , ignoring the frontier at @xmath64 . for @xmath72",
    "the mass term behavior of the three - dimensional black holes is similar to the reissner - nordstrm case , and it offers no problems . indeed , for the reissner - nordstrm black hole the metric function @xmath73 and the mass term , following the prescription above , are written as @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the energy inside the frontier @xmath64 is then given by @xmath66 , and the electrostatic energy outside is given by @xmath76 .",
    "as this last term tends to zero as @xmath77 there are no real divergences in this case , thus implying that @xmath66 carries no infinity within , and so the prescription is trivial , it gves nothing new .",
    "this is similar to what happens for three - dimensional black holes with @xmath72 . on the other hand , for @xmath78",
    "one should follow the prescription carefully , i.e. , one has to hide an infinite constant in the definition of the energy within the frontier at @xmath64 .",
    "the ansatz for the metric and dilaton fields with which we start our canonical analysis is given by @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the schwarzschild type time , radius , and angular coordinates .",
    "this is the adm ansatz for spherically symmetric solutions applied to three dimensions . in this",
    "we follow the basic formalism developed by kucha @xcite .",
    "the canonical coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath82 are functions of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "now , @xmath87 is generically on the horizon as analyzed in @xcite , but for our purposes @xmath87 represents the horizon bifurcation point of the carter - penrose diagram @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite and @xcite ) . in three spacetime dimensions the point actually represents a circle .",
    "asymptotically the coordinate @xmath84 tends to @xmath88 , and @xmath83 is another time coordinate .",
    "the remaining functions are the lapse function @xmath89 , and the shift function @xmath90 , and they will play the role of lagrange multipliers of the hamiltonian of the theory .",
    "the canonical coordinates @xmath91 and the lapse function @xmath89 are taken to be positive .",
    "the angular coordinates are left untouched , due to spherical symmetry .",
    "the dilaton is a simple function of the radial canonical coordinate , and it can be traded directly by it through equation ( [ admphiansatz ] ) , as will be done below . the ansatz ( [ adm_ansatz])-([admphiansatz ] ) is written in order to perform the foliation of spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces , and thus separates the spatial part of the spacetime from the temporal part .",
    "indeed , the canonical analysis requires the explicit separation of the time coordinate from the other space coordinates , and so in all expressions time is treated separately from the other coordinates .",
    "it breaks explicit , but not implicit , covariance of the theory , but it is necessary in order to perform the hamiltonian analysis .",
    "the metric coefficients of the induced metric on the hypersurfaces become the canonical variables , and the momenta are determined in the usual way , by replacing the time derivatives of the canonical variables , the velocities . then , using the hamiltonian , one builds a time evolution operator to construct an appropriate thermodynamic ensemble for the geometries of a quantum theory of gravity . assuming",
    "that a quantum theory only makes sense if its classical form can be quantized by hamiltonian methods , one should pick up only solutions which can be put consistently in a hamiltonian form .",
    "thus , in the following we perform a hamiltonian analysis to extract the entropy and other thermodynamic properties in the three - dimensional brans - dicke - maxwell black holes mentioned above , those for which @xmath92 .",
    "the canonical description of the vector potential one - form is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are functions of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , i. e. , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the function @xmath96 is the canonical coordinate associated with the electric field , and the function @xmath97 is the lagrange multiplier associated with the electromagnetic constraint , which is gauss law . in the same way as with the gravitational degrees of freedom above ,",
    "when the maxwell term in the action ( [ 3dchbdaction ] ) is written , the conjugate momentum to the coordinate @xmath96 can be derived the usual way from the lagrangian .",
    "for @xmath98 , the corresponding three - dimensional charged brans - dicke theory is precisely the one provided by three - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory @xcite .",
    "then the general metric in eq .",
    "( [ solutions ] ) , the @xmath30 field in eq .",
    "( [ phisolutions_1 ] ) , and the vector potential one - form ( [ vector_potential ] ) reduce to the following @xmath99 where @xmath18 is the ads length , related to the cosmological constant by @xmath100 , @xmath5 is the mass , and @xmath9 is the electric charge . in this solution",
    "the scalar field @xmath30 is trivial .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ omega_infinity_maxwell ] , we show the carter - penrose diagram of the three - dimensional charged black hole . despite there being a large and rich structure , the outside region in i is the relevant one ,",
    "thus our foliation is from the bifurcation point to @xmath101 , and our boundary conditions reflect properties of the outer horizon at @xmath102 , and of the spacelike infinity at @xmath101 .",

    "these surface terms are eliminated through judicious choice of extra surface terms which should be added to the action .",

    "note that there are time dependences on the left hand side of the falloff conditions and that there are no such dependences on the right hand side , in the lower orders of the expansion in @xmath84 .",
    "this apparent discrepancy stems from the fact that there is in fact no time dependence in the lower orders of the majority of the functions , but there may still exist such dependence for higher orders",

    "following this procedure to the end , we may then find the form of the new coordinate @xmath141 , as a function of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "first , we need to know the form of @xmath139 as a function of the canonical pair @xmath152 . for that",

    "we thus have found the form of the new canonical coordinate , @xmath5 .",
    "it is now a straightforward calculation to determine the poisson bracket of this variable with @xmath156 and see that they are conjugate , thus making eq .",
    "( [ t_linha_oo ] ) the conjugate momentum of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath157    the other natural transformation has been given in ( [ p2piq ] ) , namely the one that relates @xmath137 with @xmath9 through @xmath158 .",
    "as @xmath5 , @xmath9 is also a natural choice for canonical coordinate , being another physical parameter of the solution ( [ solucao_mtz ] ) .",
    "the one coordinate which remains to be found is @xmath10 , the conjugate momentum to the charge .",
    "it is also necessary to find out the other new canonical variable which commutes with @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , and which guarantees , with its conjugate momentum , that the transformation from @xmath159 , to @xmath5 , @xmath9 , and the new variable is canonical .",

    "so , rename the canonical variable @xmath29 as @xmath162 .",
    "we have then to find a new conjugate momentum to @xmath163 which also commutes with @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , making the transformation from @xmath164 a canonical one .",
    "the way to proceed is to look at the constraint @xmath109 , which is called in this formalism the super - momentum .",

    "it is thus equating these two expressions of the super - momentum @xmath109 , with @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 written as functions of @xmath159 and their respective momenta , that gives us one equation for the new @xmath167 and @xmath10 .",
