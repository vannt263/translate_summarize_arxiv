    "dr21(oh ) is a part of a massive star forming region in the dr21 molecular cloud complex .",
    "it lies along a ridge of strong molecular emission extending from dr21 in the south to w75n in the north . as with many objects of its type , dr21(oh ) also contains numerous sites of strong maser emission in many species . named for its particularly strong oh - masers",
    ", it was determined that the oh and h@xmath4o masers were strongly coincident with millimeter continuum sources @xcite .",
    "dr21(oh ) is particularly significant due to the detection of methanol masers over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "@xcite detected methanol masers in the 81.6 ghz and 84 ghz methanol transitions .",
    "@xcite conducted a study of 95 ghz methanol emission and found four strong methanol masers across a region associated with the mm2 millimeter source .",
    "@xcite presented detections of a previously unseen 133 ghz methanol maser . more recently ,",
    "@xcite present an extensive survey of over 30 44 ghz methanol masers , which appear to trace the shock fronts of two bow shocks along the red and blue shifted lobes of an outflow generated by mm2 .",
    "@xcite present an analysis of all methanol maser detections and determine that all of the known masers appear to come from the interface region along the shock fronts of the outflow .",
    "the brightest of these masers appear along the western tip of the outflow and occur in a narrow velocity range of approximately 0.3 - 0.5 km s@xmath3 . additionally , they determine that all the methanol maser transitions are class i masers , which arise from collisional excitations and are considered to be caused by shocks , especially those that arise from outflows , as opposed to class ii masers , in which the pumping mechanism is primarily derived from external radiation .",
    "recent submillimeter continuum and 1 mm co detections of the outflow morphology @xcite give further support to the above model .",
    "in this letter we report the first detection of an hco@xmath0 maser in the interstellar medium .",
    "dr21(oh ) was observed as part of an ongoing survey of sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with strong magnetic field detections @xcite . a 2 square arcminute region around dr21(oh )",
    "was mapped with observations by carma @xcite in the c , d , and e array configurations with a combined effective beam size of 6.3 `` x 4.0 '' , and a spectral resolution of 0.41 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this was achieved by observing in the 8 mhz bandwidth correlator mode with 63 channels .",
    "the j = 1 - 0 transition of hco@xmath0 , with a rest frequency of 89.188526 ghz , was simultaneously observed with hcn , n@xmath4h@xmath0 , and two continuum bands .",
    "a bright , unresolved , and unusually narrow line feature was detected in the map of hco@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ maser_a ] ) , at 20@xmath538@xmath659.3@xmath7 + 42@xmath82249.0  ( j2000 ) with a peak at v@xmath9 0.78 km s@xmath3 .",
    "each track was inspected to rule out the possibility of a transient instrumental issue ; however , the compact source was visible in each track .",
    "the spatial and spectral location of the source additionally does not change between each of the tracks , indicating that an instrumental issue is unlikely .",
    "follow - up observations in carma b - array configuration ( fig .",
    "[ maser_b ] ) were performed in december 2011 in order to further constrain the physical size and brightness of the source . in total ,",
    "five tracks of data were observed for a total of 18.75 hours : 4 hours each in b , c , and e arrays , and 6.75 hours in d array ( over two tracks ) .",
    "data were calibrated and imaged with the carma miriad software package .",
    "the phase calibrator used in all tracks was 2038 + 513 . due to the strength of the calibrator",
    ", we were able to use the standard phase calibration techniques .",
    "the b - array track has an improved spectral resolution of 0.14 km s@xmath3 over the other tracks , due to being observed with the expanded carma 8-band correlator in the 8 mhz bandwidth mode with 384 hanning smoothed spectral channels ( figure [ maser_b ] shows the 192 spectrally independent channels ) .",
    "using the high resolution b - array data , we find that the angular size of this object is less than @xmath10 0.8 arcseconds and that it has a brightness temperature @xmath2 1900 k. since the source remained unresolved in b - array , the parameters of this object can be further constrained by using only long baseline components of the data set .",
    "this effectively `` resolves out '' larger scale structure , leaving a constrained map behind . to achieve this",
    ", we limited the map to use baselines larger than 140 k@xmath11 ( @xmath10 470 meters ) .",
    "this procedure resulted in a map with an effective beam size of @xmath100.54  x 0.52  and a brightness temperature of @xmath2 2500 k. the source appears to be unresolved even at this resolution ( fig [ maser_b ] , top panel ) .",
    "if the source were dominated by thermal emission , a lower bound on its linewidth can be estimated by calculating the degree by which the emission would be thermally broadened .",
    "the calculated full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) linewidth would then be purely a function of the effective brightness temperature : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the brightness temperature of the source and @xmath14 is the atomic weight of the molecule .",
    "the factor of @xmath15 comes from the conversion of a gaussian standard deviation to fwhm . for a source with a brightness temperature of 2546 k and rms noise of 8.6 k ( 0.015 jy beam@xmath3 ) , the thermal linewidth would be 2.077 @xmath16 0.004 km s@xmath3 , which is significantly greater than the observed linewidth of 0.497 @xmath16 0.002 km s@xmath3 ( obtained by least - squares gaussian fitting to the line profile ) .",
    "the maser linewidth corrected for the instrumental smoothing is 0.477 @xmath16 0.002 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the observed high brightness temperature and linewidth narrowing are good indicators that this object is dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "an assumption as to the type of maser emission can be made from this linewidth analysis .",
    "saturated masers can have linewidths up to the thermal linewidth , while unsaturated masers will have a linewidth narrower than the thermal linewidth by a factor of 4 to 5 @xcite . since our object has a linewidth that is 4.2 times narrower than the thermal linewidth , it is consistent with an unsaturated maser .",
    "@xcite observed this region with bima at the 95 ghz methanol line and discovered four methanol masers connected by large scale methanol emission .",
    "the brightest of these four sources , dr21(oh)-1 , is centered at 20@xmath538@xmath659.24@xmath7 @xmath1742@xmath82249.04  ( j2000 ) with a peak at v@xmath18= 0.32 km s@xmath3 , which is approximately 0.1  from the center of our measured hco@xmath0 peak .",
    "the hco@xmath0 position has an approximate positional error of 0.2  , and the methanol positions have an error of 0.3 ",
    ". from these data they estimated their methanol maser had an angular diameter @xmath194.4  and a brightness temperature @xmath2 760 k. three other methanol masers were also observed ; however , there is no evidence of companion hco@xmath0 masers ( fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "this could possibly be due to their relatively weaker strength or due to the fact that the conditions necessary to produce an hco@xmath0 maser do not exist at these other positions .",
    "the co - location of the hco@xmath0 object and the methanol maser suggest that both arise from similar conditions .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that such regions could be created from the interaction of an outflow and small clumps of dense molecular gas .    in comparing the b - array maps ( figure [ maser_b ] )",
    ", it appears as if the maser could be partially resolved since its intensity drops from 7.4 jy beam@xmath3 to 4.7 jy beam@xmath3 between them , with slight n - s structure .",
    "@xcite reports that there are three methanol masers within 2  of the hco@xmath0 emission ; one strong and two weaker masers , slightly north and south of the strongest maser .",
    "if the hco@xmath0 maser is also a complex of three individual sources oriented in a n - s direction , the highest resolution b - array map may be beginning to distinguish them , giving an appearance of being resolved .",
    "in the d and e arrays , the sharp maser `` peak '' extends @xmath10 7.5 jy beam@xmath3 above the extended emission , in agreement with the flux density in the b - array spectrum .",
    "a small amount of hco@xmath0 absorption is visible in the e - array map ; however , it is not apparent that the maser linewidth is affected by self - absorbtion . in this map",
    ", the shortest baselines will sample large enough size scales to include the western extension of the continuum that peaks with dr21(oh)-mm2 .",
    "furthermore , the hco@xmath0 emission includes two velocity components associated with extended gas , one at -4.7 km s@xmath3 , and another peaking at @xmath10 0 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the peak positions of these two velocity components correspond to the continuum peaks of mm1 and mm2 respectively .",
    "the high velocity wing of the -4.7 km s@xmath3 component is affected by absorption by the continuum in the e - array map , however , the 0 km s@xmath3 component is not .",
    "the d and c array maps with smaller beam sizes ( longer baselines ) are not affected by this continuum contamination or the extended hco@xmath0 emission which is resolved out .",
    "@xcite performed 1 mm observations of several spectral lines around dr21(oh ) .",
    "included with these observations are co(2 - 1 ) observations which trace an outflow from dr21(oh)-mm2 .",
    "this outflow appears to be in the plane of the sky ( fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) . from this figure",
    ", we can see that both the methanol maser and our hco@xmath0 object appear along the edge of the outflow .",
    "this region would be highly shocked , and the energy released from this interaction has the potential to power the maser .",
    "@xcite analyzed the j = 1 - 0 transition of co and determined that a large range of rotational excitation temperatures , including population inversion , can be produced through collisional excitation in the range of kinetic temperatures and densities found in molecular clouds .",
    "it was also concluded that other linear molecules with simple rotational structure , such as hco@xmath0 , would have the same result . using the radex radiative transfer package @xcite",
    ", we performed a test calculation that showed that for collisional interaction such as is suggested here in dr21(oh ) , it is possible to achieve population inversion in the hco@xmath0 j = 1 - 0 transition with gas densities of @xmath20 @xmath21 and kinetic temperatures @xmath1050 k ( consistent with kinetic temperatures in outflow shocked regions ) .",
    "this result further supports the conclusion that this hco@xmath0 is a maser .",
    "observations of dr21(oh ) have revealed the presence of a compact object which is dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "the extremely compact size of this object coupled with its large brightness leads to the following conclusions :    * the source is co - located with a known strong methanol maser . *",
    "it lies along the edge of an outflow which gives support to previous theories that masers can arise due to the interactions of high velocity outflows with cold , dense clumps of molecular gas .",
    "* its small spatial size most likely prevented its detection before now ; emission from this source would be beam diluted to levels indistinguishable from thermal emission . *",
    "this object is very likely an unsaturated maser , the first observed in hco@xmath0 .    in order to further confirm that this source is indeed a maser ,",
    "future observations to look for anomalous level populations in higher order hco@xmath0 transitions should be performed .",
    "support for carma construction was derived from the states of california , illinois , and maryland , the james s. mcdonnell foundation , the gordon and betty moore foundation , the kenneth t. and eileen l. norris foundation , the university of chicago , the associates of the california institute of technology , and the national science foundation .",
    "ongoing carma development and operations are supported by the national science foundation under a cooperative agreement ( nsf ast 08 - 38226 ) , and by the carma partner universities .",
