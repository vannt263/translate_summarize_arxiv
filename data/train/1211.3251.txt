    "research originated from a practical problem of inspection of a certain cam profile : there was , on a small part of the ^@xmath217-profile , a big discrepancy between nominal and measured curves .",

    "while exploring the situation , the author has become interested to find some quantitative measure of such drawbacks in drawings , possibly , a tool for an expert - metrologist .",
    "purely geometrically the problem was shaped as follows : to describe a set of curves _ with as few vertices as possible _ , matching given interpolation data . the simplest case ( spiral , zero vertices ) gave a well restricted solution , justifying such problem setting .",
    "proposition3 is the step towards non - spiral curves .",
    "bounding region is not quite a new concept for industrial design . returning to fig . , consider the hole , dimensioned as @xmath218 .",
    "this can be treated as the bounding region ( in the form of ring ) for the circular profile .",
    "the given tolerance admits inaccuracy of order  @xmath219 in coordinates of the center of the hole .",
    "if declared as the datum element , the hole defines the origin of the coordinate system ; consequently , any other dimension of the type `` coordinate '' on this drawing should be agreed with this inaccuracy .",
    "e.g. , setting tolerance of order  @xmath220 for the dimension @xmath221 would be an evident error in the drawing .",
    "normally such error will be corrected by an expert - metrologist before starting the manufacturing process .",
    "possible correction could be specifying _ the roundness tolerance  @xmath222 _ for the hole .",
    "this allows the value of diameter still to be in the range @xmath223 , but reduces the width of the ring - shaped bounding region to much smaller acceptable value .",
    "note that , given all dimensions and tolerances , one can usually construct the exact model of the ideal part , corresponging , for the case of the hole , to @xmath224 .",
    "the position of any point of the circular and straight line elements will be perfectly determined .",
    "but this is not so for the elements like profile @xmath5 .",
    "since it is not presented by exact equations , and the interpolation method is not exactly specified , there occurs certain _ nondeterminancy _ is constructing the nominal profile itself .    assuming a coordinate inspection machine as a device for tolerance control , one should assure precision of coordinate measurements about 10% of tolerances under inspection .",
    "the more accurate is the device , the more precisely the distance from the measured point to a circle / line can be defined .",
    "again , this is not the case for the curvilinear profile : one could define exact distance , say , to the currently chosen interpolant .",
    "the latter could be different from one , previously used in nc - machining process .",
    "so , the nondeterminancy of the profile behaves as inevitable addition to the measurement error .",
    "constructing the bounding region estimates this nondeterminancy , and allows us to set its acceptable limits , called by the accuracy requirements .",
    "the width of the region is the objective measure of fairness of the given point set , and may serve as the criterion to demand a designer for more detailed profile description .    for traditional interpolation methods",
    "nothing ensures that some interpolant passes within the prescribed bounding region .",
    "but , on the other hand , one can verify whether it does or not .",
    "an example is discussed below .",
    "algorithms of interpolation with spirals are not widely distributed with cad software . on the other hand , interpolating spiral data by , e.g. , a cubic spline , will usually not return a spiral .",
    "however , as soon as the region is known , wherein the sought for curve definitely lies , acceptance test for any interpolation method can be performed .",
    "we add to this note an example of such test . in fig .",
    "given data points and end tangents were interpolated by a cubic spline curve .",
    "the nodes in the example are spaced out such as one could visually estimate if the spline fits the prescribed region ( three last chords are shown magnified ) .",
    "the spline can be parametrized by accumulated chord length , which approximates arc length of the interpolated curve . assuming that the 3-rd order bezir polynomials @xmath225 are close to the taylor series @xmath226 of the naturally parametrized unknown curve gives rise to set boundary conditions at the start point of the cubic spline as @xmath227 , and similarly at the endpoint .",
    "points setting of 5 first nodes , compared to expected curvatures , is evidently unacceptable for good interpolation .",
    "it is exhibited in both location of the spline out of prescribed region , and large beatings in the curvature plot .",
    "situation on the right side looks much better , although points are set still too rare , compared with typical industrial drawings . recall that the bounding region encloses some unknown , but well defined curve ( e.g. , solution of a differential equation , or some other implementation of designer s concept ) . with such test",
    "it is possible :    * to estimate whether the bounding region is sufficiently narrow , i.e. the unknown curve is well / ill - defined by the given point set ; * to estimate closeness of the unknown curve and the interpolant , which , even for non - spiral interpolation method , may fall inside the bounding region .",
    "appearance of the curvature plot in fig .",
    ", with curvature extrema in every node and between them , is rather similar to the examples in .",
    "the question arises if the non - monotonicity of the curvature plot is essential , and should be somehow corrected .",
    "the general answer depends on the values of curvatures , and the particular reason to avoid the beatings . analyzing the problem",
    ", one should not forget that the objects of computer - aided design become the objects of further manufacturing , which is not geometrically precise .",
    "we can compare the model and the real part ( cam profile , highway path , etc . ) , and find that the latter fits well prescribed tolerances .",
    "but small difference between two curves could result in rather big distortions of curvature plot : +   + in the above illustration the data is chosen on the circular arc of radius 10 with @xmath228 , and @xmath229 .",
    "ideal descrete curvature plot is the line @xmath230 .",
    "manufacturing / measurement errors were imitated by rounding the coordinates to two decimal digits : @xmath231 was repalced by @xmath232 , @xmath233 by @xmath234 ,  , and @xmath235 by @xmath236 .",
    "this rounding caused well visible beatings in discrete curvature plot .",
    "the geometric reason of such behavior is evident : for a small circular arc @xmath237 a slight shift of the midpoint  @xmath238 effects a dramatic change in radius or curvature .",
    "the smaller is the angular measure of the arc , the greater is this effect .",
