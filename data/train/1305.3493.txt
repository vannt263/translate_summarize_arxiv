    "in our paper @xcite we reanalyze the radial @xmath1 and angular - momentum @xmath2 regge trajectories for all light - quark states with baryon number zero listed in the 2011 edition of the particle data tables .",
    "the parameters of the trajectories were obtained with linear regression , with weight of each resonance inversely proportional to its half - width squared , what we called the _ half - width rule _ @xcite .",
    "we argued in @xcite that the half - width rule fully complies to the large-@xmath0 viewpoint and actually suggests an interesting interpretation : the regge - fitted masses are considered to be the leading-@xmath0 contribution to the mass of the resonance .",
    "this incorporates a desirable flexibility as to what should the regge fit be compared to .    in his comment",
    "@xcite , d.  bugg , making use of the crystal barrel determinations , argues against our usage of the half - width rule to analyze the pdg collection of light non - strange @xmath3-states in order to study the radial regge trajectories . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", he concludes in his comment that the @xmath0 world is different from @xmath4 . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", he disagrees in our selection of states in the fit .",
    "it should be pointed out that the comment and our work not only are made on different levels but actually have different scopes . in the comment a particular parameterization",
    "is taken to assess the accuracy of the determination of resonance masses .",
    "no attempt to discuss any possible systematic errors is undertaken , thus it is unclear whether such an accuracy turns out to be a compromise between a bias in the choice of the particular method or the attempt to make such a choice to comply with the data .",
    "in contrast , our work provides an attempt to determine the validity of the linear regge formula for the leading large-@xmath0 contribution to the mass of the mesonic state for both the radial and the angular - momentum trajectories .",
    "however , most states entering the validation of the formula are unstable states , i.e. resonances , which on a rigorous basis are characterized as poles of the @xmath5-matrix on the second riemann sheet of the complex plane of the mandelstam s - variable .",
    "this provides a unique and process - independent definition , whereas the corresponding complex residue reflects the coupling to the background process where the resonance is generated .",
    "we understand that in any quantum field theory , and in qcd in particular , the positions of such poles are a well defined concept . however , complex energies can not be measured and an analytic continuation to the complex plane is required .",
    "if the amplitude on the real axis is just approximated or a model is used , the analytic continuation amplifies the uncertainty in the resonance parameters .",
    "this , of course , requires providing a definition on what should be called the `` experimental '' resonance mass .",
    "although there are a few definitions , any of them reflects both the distance to the real axis as well as the influence of the background .",
    "in other words , different models and/or definitions provide different numbers and comparisons require to take this into account .    from a purely theoretical point of view",
    "there is no obvious reason why the regge formula for mesons @xmath6 should be exact in qcd and the puzzling fact that it works so nicely demands an explanation .",
    "but it is far from obvious that the breit - wigner definition or a pole definition should reproduce the regge formula any better than other choices .",
    "it is this kind of a puzzle that motivated our research .",
    "as argued in our article , a possible model - independent way of approaching the problem from the point of view of qcd is by invoking the large-@xmath0 expansion , where resonances become stable since the ratio of width to mass is @xmath7 suppressed .",
    "we quoted the value deduced from the pdg for this ratio , namely @xmath8  @xcite , which follows from using all the listed resonances and which suggests the goodness of the approach for the present discussion .",
    "further , the mass shift is also @xmath7 suppressed , which is parametrically the same as the width , such that we take half of the width as a crude ( and possibly too large ) estimate . on the other hand , different methods to define the width , such as the breit - wigner , the time delay , the speed plot , etc .",
    ", would yield different numerical values for the resonance mass that might not exceed this half - width estimate .",
    "this consideration solves the problem of the magnification of errors when going from the real axis to the complex plane .",
    "while this may be a too conservative estimate concerning the mass shift , it certainly provides a credible upper bound buttressing the half - width rule . in spite of this crude estimate",
    ", the globality of the analysis provides some accurate statements which were presented as the main result of our article .",
    "this was the framework of our motivation and conclusions .",
    "we have never pretended to go beyond that .",
    "the reader should also notice that we have considered other fit functions inspired by other theoretical frameworks ( such as a linear n - dependence of the masses ) and our choice is the one favored by the quality of the fits within the generous half - width rule uncertainties .         from a more phenomenological point of view ,",
    "all the information on the states collected in our publications are extracted from the particle data group tables .",
    "while this may be unsatisfactory for the author of the comment for certain states which might be slightly misplaced , within the half - width uncertainty these changes do not modify our global picture .",
    "the question on whether the crystal ball measurements are underrepresented in the pdg compilation , while interesting in its own , was naturally not within the scope of our study .",
    "in particular , we wanted to test the hypothesis of the universality of the angular - momentum and radial regge trajectories and for that our usage of the data needs to be `` global '' . in this regard",
    "the particle data tables provide us with the best compilation of the data .",
    "we have two categories of radial regge trajectories . in the first category",
    "we include the trajectories with three or more states , all of them considered by the particle data group as a well determined resonance .",
    "we establish a final averaged value for the slope of the radial regge trajectory considering only this set of trajectories .",
    "in the second category we include all the trajectories with only two states , or states not confirmed by the particle data group , although commented and included in our analysis for completeness . this category is not taken into account for the final compilation .",
    "we understand that a line can always go through two points but this does not confirm or refute the linearity of the regge trajectories . in this respect ,",
    "trajectories with large slope error such as the @xmath9 pointed out in the comment produce null impact in our averaged result .    considering our published work together with the comment , after all the scrutiny and detailed discussion",
    ", we do not see such a difference and such an amount of defects in the choice of data as claimed by the author of the comment .",
    "in fact , we agree on the @xmath10 , @xmath11 families ( accounting for more than 50 states ) and only disagree in the classification of a few states from the @xmath12 families ( less than 10 states ) .",
    "taken into account that the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 families do not appear in the comment ( there are around 25 states not considered in it ) , we indeed find quite a good agreement in the selection of the data in both approaches .",
    "we notice that our inspection of states also includes @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the angular - momentum regge trajectory analysis .",
    "in this regard , we repeat our fits with the subset of states provided in the comment ( accepting the extreme case that all the criticism raised there is correct and that our selection of data were wrong ) , keeping the half - width rule and only trajectories with three or more states ( following the previous argumentations ) . in this new scenario",
    "we would have fewer radial trajectories as shown in fig .",
    "[ plot ] . indeed , for ease of comparison with our previous published results ( shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ plot ] ) , we keep the same labeling in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ plot ] but with empty result for the trajectories rejected in the comment .",
    "the new weighted averaged slope for radial regge trajectories would be @xmath20 and for the angular - momentum trajectories @xmath21 to be compared with @xmath22 and @xmath23 from ref .",
    "we notice that , although the averaged slopes are a bit smaller than in our publication ( compatible within errors ) the universality of radial and angular - momentum regge trajectories is still not fulfilled at the level of @xmath24 standard deviations ( compared to the @xmath25 standard deviation found previously ) , so our conclusion that no strict universality of slopes occurs in the light non - strange meson spectra is still valid .    in summary ,",
    "we believe that both analyses do not oppose necessarily , since the scope is different ; we see no obvious reason why the breit - wigner masses obtained from the crystal barrel data should be directly compared to qcd - inspired models .",
    "we admit an existing source of systematic error within the large-@xmath0 approach motivated by our attempt to estimate the slopes within that leading order .",
    "we never tried to replace any previous experimental analyses , but rather , to provide some insight taking into account the 1/@xmath0 theoretical errors ."
