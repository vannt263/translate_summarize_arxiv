    "hall drift , the effect of advection of magnetic flux by the current - carrying electrons , has long been thought to be important for the evolution of the crustal fields of neutron stars . @xcite",
    "initially hypothesized that this effect could transport flux towards the outer regions of the crust , where ohmic dissipation is much more effective than in the inner regions . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite provided an order - of - magnitude estimate that implies that magnetar - like fields could evolve in less than a million years . since hall drift is a conservative effect , their proposed mechanism for the field decay",
    "was based on the production of a turbulent cascade .",
    "this would drive the field to small - scale structures upon which ohmic dissipation could act effectively .    in order to study the possible presence of instabilities",
    ", @xcite studied a homogeneous plane - parallel model and performed a perturbation analysis against a background field that lies on the plane , discovering unstable modes with exponential growth rates . using a similar model",
    ", @xcite showed that the evolution through hall drift is governed by burgers equation , which develops strong discontinuities corresponding to current sheets .",
    "the inclusion of ohmic dissipation results in rapid decay of magnetic energy in these regions .",
    "@xcite extended this result to the case of a purely toroidal ( azimuthal ) and axially symmetric magnetic field , showing in this case that the evolution through hall drift can again be described with burgers equation , with analogous implications .",
    "they also argued that any small poloidal perturbation to the toroidal field would end up being amplified .",
    "although these analytical developments are a big step forward in the understanding of the evolution of the magnetic field in a neutron star , a full comprehension of this process seems to require the use of numerical simulations due to its complex non - linear character .",
    "early simulations performed by @xcite for the case of a spatially homogenous resistivity and electron density , show that in fact purely toroidal fields can develop strong discontinuities and experience fast ohmic dissipation .",
    "also with homogenous models , but dealing mostly with predominantly poloidal ( meridional ) fields , @xcite and @xcite observed oscillatory phenomena , without a strong enhancement of the decay rates through hall drift , compared to the case of pure ohmic dissipation . taking into account a range of models covering predominantly toroidal and predominantly poloidal fields , @xcite showed that the decay rates were consistently higher as the toroidal field increased in importance . in models that included a simple stratified crust @xcite or with realistic values for electron density and resistivity @xcite , efficient decay",
    "is observed associated with the formation of strong current sheets , and not due to displacement of magnetic field to areas of lower conductivity as proposed by @xcite . also , as an ordered component remains for long times",
    ", the magnetic field does not appear to undergo the hall cascade of @xcite either .",
    "recently , elaborate models have been produced that take into account the full magneto - thermal evolution of the neutron star ( though allowing for field evolution only in the crust ) .",
    "@xcite studied the coupling of the magnetic field to the thermal evolution using only ohmic decay , while @xcite included hall drift into these models .",
    "their results show the critical importance of using a fully consistent model in order to produce a realistic evolution , as feedback between the magnetic field and the thermal structure is very strong in both ways .",
    "we intend to study the magnetic field stability in axial symmetry for a couple of hall equilibrium configurations that can be expressed in closed analytical forms . @xcite",
    "already studied the evolution due to hall drift using different initial conditions which included a poloidal equilibrium field .",
    "although the early evolution differed from case to case , they noted that on long times the field evolved towards similar configurations that consist of a poloidal field with a dipole and a counter - aligned octupole ( meaning that the dipolar and octupolar components have opposite signs at the poles ) , coupled through a weak quadrupolar toroidal field . @xcite further developed this concept referring to this final state as an `` attractor '' .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows :  [ ch::methods ] briefly describes the methods used in our work . ",
    "[ ch::poltor ] deals with the effects of having initial conditions that are initially dominated by either a poloidal or a toroidal field , essentially reproducing the results of @xcite but with a consistent normalization of the field that allows proper comparisons between simulations .  [ ch::equil ] provides a study of the stability of two different equilibrium fields , one purely poloidal extending to the vacuum outside the star , and another one that is a mix of a poloidal and a toroidal field , artificially constrained to remain confined to the crust . finally , ",
    "[ ch : conclusions ] provides our conclusions and discussion of the results .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the magnetic field evolution in the crusts of neutron stars , ignoring possible effects involving the fluid core . in the crust ,",
    "ions are locked into a crystal lattice , and the only freely moving charged species are the electrons .",
    "this electron fluid should have a negligible acceleration , which in turn implies that the lorentz force should be equal to the time - averaged momentum loss through collisions . under these approximations ,",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field @xmath0 can be described by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we only consider models for which @xmath3 and @xmath2 are constant both in space and time .",
    "this equation contains two different effects that act on two distinct timescales , which can be estimated as @xmath4 where we introduced the characteristic value @xmath5 for the magnetic field , and @xmath6 is a characteristic length scale of variation , which for this work we take to be the thickness of the neutron star crust .",
    "the ratio of these two quantities defines the so - called magnetization parameter @xmath7 ( a close analog to the reynolds number of fluid mechanics ) , @xmath8 which quantifies the relative importance of both effects .",
    "as the value of @xmath7 is fundamentally dependent on the meaning we give to the characteristic field @xmath5 , it is desirable to choose this value in a physically unambiguous way . for the purpose of this work",
    ", we will define the characteristic field @xmath5 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the volume of the crust and @xmath11 is the total magnetic energy ( including the external vacuum field , if present ) .",

    "* ) , we assume that the core is a superconductor with a perfect meissner effect , and the radius of the crust - core interface is defined as @xmath24 , which we choose as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radius of the star . the conditions used at this boundary",
    "are then the continuity of the radial component of the magnetic field and the continuity of the tangential electric field , which we call `` meissner boundary conditions '' .    in order to compare our simulations with those of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we will also simulate the case with `` zero boundary conditions '' where both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are forced at the inner boundary .",
    "this approximation is usually justified by saying that , since @xmath7 is a large number for high field neutron stars , resistive terms can be ignored , in which case the meissner boundary conditions reduce to that . however , even in this limit , there are no physical reasons to impose this condition , since it implies that there is no surface current in the @xmath14-direction , whereas surface currents in the @xmath15-direction are allowed .    for the boundary condition at the surface ,",
    "we take the exterior of the star to be a vacuum , with all 3 field components continuous across the interface , as surface currents should dissipate very efficiently .    for a comprehensive description of the boundary conditions used , refer to appendix [ appendix::boundary ] .      for the purpose of studying the evolution of an axially symmetric field in a neutron star crust ,",
    "we have developed a ftcs ( forward time centered space ) code to solve eqs .",
    "( [ intro::eqs ] ) , where the temporal discretization is done via the forward euler method , which is first order in time , while spatial derivatives are solved with a central difference scheme that is second order in space .",

    "the result of these are described in appendix [ appendix::holcom ] .",
    "as shown by the models of constant electron density and resistivity of @xcite , evolution due to hall drift is significantly different depending on whether the poloidal or the toroidal component is dominant . however , their definition of the characteristic field @xmath5 is simply the strongest value it takes , which means that their simulations of mixed fields at equal @xmath7 do not share the same total magnetic energy .",
    "here we perform a similar analysis , but we compare the evolution of different field configurations that do share the same energy .    defining @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the fundamental poloidal and toroidal ohmic modes for zero boundary conditions ( see appendix [ appendix::ohmmodes ] ) , such that both are normalized to the same energy , we study combinations of the form @xmath31 all of which have the same total energy ( and thus , the same characteristic magnetic field @xmath5 as given by eq .",
