    "many ideas have been suggested for solving the cosmological constant problem @xcite , but none so far has proven to be completely satisfactory .",
    "an old idea is that the vacuum energy of ordinary fields is cancelled by some compensating field , sometimes called a  cosmon \" .",
    "the cosmon would roll down a potential hill until it had lowered the total vacuum energy to an acceptable level @xcite .",
    "the question is how the cosmon field would  know \" when to stop rolling . if the cosmon potential happened to have a minimum at exactly the right height , it can cancel off other contributions to @xmath3",
    ". however , that would obviously be nothing other than a manual setting of the total @xmath3 to zero at the minimum , i.e. just the old fine - tuning of @xmath3 that one is trying to avoid .    if a conspiracy of parameters is to be avoided , it is imperative that the cosmon action does not directly depend on the contributions to @xmath3 coming from other sectors of the theory . but how , in that case , is the cosmon to know when to stop rolling ?",
    "some sort of feedback mechanism is required .",
    "several such mechanisms have been proposed over the years @xcite .",
    "the one we will explore in this paper was proposed in the papers of ref .",
    "@xcite in the mid 1980s , and is based on the idea that the cosmon field couples to the scalar curvature @xmath4 . since the trace of the einstein field equations tells us that @xmath5 , the cosmon can learn about @xmath3 through its effect on @xmath4 .",
    "the conventional wisdom , based on a  no - go theorem \" stated in weinberg s well - known 1989 review of the cosmological constant problem , is that this kind of feedback mechanism can not work .",
    "however , this  theorem \" , which originally comes from the papers @xcite , does not apply to the kind of model we discuss in this paper , as we shall see .",
    "( note : we will be using units where @xmath6 , signature -+++ , and the sign convention in which a sphere has negative @xmath4 . )    before exploring this idea further , there is a general point that may be important . in any realistic feedback mechanism",
    ", it would seem that the  effective vacuum energy \" @xmath7  by which we mean the vacuum energy from other sectors of the theory ( @xmath3 ) plus the potential energy in the cosmon field ( @xmath8 )  must fall to zero as time passes in such a way that it is always of roughly the same order as the matter energy density , @xmath9 . by ",
    "matter \" here we mean all forms of particles , including baryons , photons , neutrinos , dark matter particles , etc .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "if @xmath7 falls off significantly more _ slowly _ than @xmath9 , then it will quickly come to dominate the universe , which will end up with @xmath10 being negligibly small .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath7 falls off significantly _ faster _ than @xmath9 , then very early in the history of the universe the effective cosmological constant would be much smaller than @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the temperature of the universe .",
    "however , that would mean that any subsequent phase transition ( such as one associated with the symmetry breaking of grand unification , the weak interactions , or the chiral symmetry of the quarks ) would drive @xmath7 very negative , since it would lower @xmath3 by an amount of order @xmath11 .",
    "given the arguments of coleman and de luccia @xcite and more recently from a string theoretic viewpoint , banks @xcite , it is questionable whether such a transition could occur .",
    "but if it did , once the universe has negative @xmath7 , it is not clear how it could get out of that hole , as it would have to in order to be consistent with present observations .",
    "the upshot is that any successful feedback mechanism would seem to require that the hidden energy density of @xmath3 plus  cosmon \" field energy must be roughly of order the density of ordinary matter at all times .",
    "this is very suggestive , given the puzzling fact that a dark energy has been observed that is comparable to the matter energy today .",
    "the feedback model we discuss does indeed have the desired feature that @xmath13 at all times .",
    "as we shall see , however , this does not necessarily account for the dark energy that has been observed .",
    "the problem is that any mechanism that is designed to erase @xmath3 will tend to erase dark energy too . in the model",
    "we discuss there is indeed energy that is  dark \" ( namely @xmath14 ) , which generally falls to zero roughly as @xmath0 and has @xmath15 .",
    "however , after a phase transition @xmath7 tends to fall more slowly for a period of time , so that @xmath16 can be smaller than @xmath17 and perhaps even close to @xmath18 .",
    "it is possible that this fact can be used to account for the nearly constant dark energy that has recently been observed .    to return to the specific idea that the feedback occurs through coupling of the cosmon to the scalar curvature @xmath4 , the obvious way for this to happen is through the cosmon potential . to illustrate how this might work ,",
    "consider a toy model @xcite with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 always denotes the cosmon in this paper .",
    "the effective vacuum energy , as we defined it above , is then @xmath21 .",
    "as the cosmon rolls down its linear potential hill , @xmath7 will decrease ; and as that happens , the scalar curvature will decrease as well .",
    "this decrease of the scalar curvature reduces the slope ( @xmath22 ) of the cosmon potential , and therefore the cosmon rolling will decelerate ( since there is friction due to the hubble expansion ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath4 receives contributions only from @xmath7 , then as @xmath7 approaches zero , the slope of the cosmon potential will approach zero also , and the velocity of the cosmon s rolling will approach zero .",
    "in other words , whatever the value of @xmath3 is , the quantity @xmath7 will asymptotically approach zero as time passes .",
    "that is , the potential energy of the cosmon , @xmath23 will progressively erase @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , this is what actually would happen in this toy model , as an explicit solution of the field equations shows .",
    "unfortunately , however , newton s constant @xmath2 suffers a disaster . instead of the usual einstein - hilbert action @xmath24 , one has @xmath25 .",
    "since the quantity @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the background scalar curvature of the universe ) is asymptotically approaching @xmath3 , that means that @xmath28 is asymptotically approaching @xmath29 , which is exponentially large at present ( @xmath30 ) . in other words ,",
    "newton s  constant \" turns off in a drastic way .",
    "this is the problem that seems to afflict any attempt to construct a feedback mechanism through a coupling of the cosmon to the scalar curvature through the cosmon potential .",
    "( this is the conclusion that was reached in the papers @xcite and repeated in weinberg s 1989 review @xcite . )",
    "this led to an attempt in @xcite to achieve a viable feedback through the _ kinetic _ term of the cosmon .",
    "what is required is that negative powers of @xmath4 appear in the cosmon kinetic term , which , of course , is a peculiar thing indeed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a model that erases the cosmological constant without any fine - tuning of parameters at the classical level can easily be constructed as shown in @xcite . in the paper",
    "we correct and extend the analysis in that earlier paper , and address several important issues that were not considered there .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the toy model that we are discussing and find cosmological solutions for the cases where cosmon energy is dominant and where radiation is dominant .",
    "( in @xcite only the cosmon - dominated case was considered , and the analysis of it was faulty , since certain assumptions were made that were not self - consistent . ) we also discuss the stability of the solutions , and what the cosmon equation of state looks like . we find that while there are modifications to the effective newton s constant ( because of the appearance of @xmath4 in the cosmon kinetic term ) , they are of order 1 and harmless .    in section 3 , we look at what happens when baryonic matter ( or other matter whose stress - energy tensor is not traceless ) is present .",
    "we confirm the conclusion of @xcite that this does not disturb the feedback mechanism for erasing the cosmological constant .",
    "however , there is an interesting effect : the cosmon field does wipe out the trace of the stress - energy tensor inside baryonic matter ( contrary to what was claimed in @xcite ) .",
    "that is , inside a lump of baryonic matter ( e.g. a nucleon , atomic nucleus , or neutron star ) the cosmon field has a pressure and density such that the total stress - energy tensor is traceless .",
    "however , this has less dramatic effects than one might suppose .",
    "this will be analyzed in section 3 .    in section 4",
    ", we discuss other issues , such as stability of solutions , what happens if the vacuum energy is suddenly reset by a phase transition , and quantum corrections to the model and fine - tuning .    in the appendix",
    "we point out certain mistakes and deficiencies in the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the model that we shall discuss in the rest of this paper has the action @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a parameter with dimensions of @xmath33 that we take to be of order one in planckian units .",
    "@xmath34 is the vacuum energy that we are trying to erase .",
    "( it may change suddenly if there is a first order phase transition . )",
    "the third term is just the usual einstein - hilbert action .",
    "our metric signature is @xmath35 .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath4 is negative for a sphere .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "as the cosmon rolls down its potential hill , the effective vacuum energy @xmath36 will decrease , causing @xmath24 to decrease also .",
    "this in turn will cause the kinetic term of the cosmon to stiffen , so that the rolling of the cosmon will slow down . as @xmath4 approaches zero , so does the velocity of the cosmon .",
    "in fact , even though @xmath4 approaches zero , @xmath37 approaches zero faster , so that the kinetic energy of @xmath20 becomes smaller , not larger , even though @xmath4 is in the denominator .",
    "our explicit solutions will show this .    having a negative power of @xmath4 in the cosmon kinetic term @xcite",
    "can be avoided if we use an auxiliary field : @xmath38    the power @xmath39 in the kinetic term of the auxiliary field @xmath40 must be large enough so that @xmath40 can adjust rapidly to changes in @xmath4 . for large @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath39 this version of the model reduces to that in eq .",
    "we shall therefore use eq .",
    "the gravity equation coming from eq .",
    "( 1 ) is @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 which implies , of course , that @xmath45 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) arises from @xmath46 after two integrations by parts . as we shall see , when there is only cosmon energy , the combination of fields that we have called @xmath47 ends up being simply a constant , so that the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) vanishes . when there is matter present , however , @xmath47 is not constant and the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) becomes very important , as we shall see .    if we take the trace of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we get @xmath48 the equation of motion for @xmath20 is @xmath49 = \\alpha , \\label{scalareom}\\ ] ] and assuming a flat friedmann - robertson walker ( frw ) ansatz for the metric , the expression for the scalar curvature in terms of the scale factor of the universe @xmath50 is , with our sign conventions , @xmath51    we will solve these equations first in the case where there is no ordinary matter , but only cosmon energy .",
    "let us assume that @xmath52 and that the fields are constant in space .",
    "then the cosmon equation of motion becomes @xmath53 = - \\alpha^2/c^2 $ ] , and has the solution @xmath54 the second term on the right is a transient that dies off rapidly .",
    "( it has already implicitly been assumed to be negligible , since its presence would cause the scale factor to deviate from a pure power dependence on @xmath55 . )",
    "it is easily shown that the solution to the coupled equations gives @xmath4 proportional to @xmath7 , so we will write @xmath56 , with the number @xmath57 to be determined . substituting this into eq .",
    "( 9 ) and dropping the transient term gives @xmath58 , for large @xmath55 @xcite . from this , it is easy to see that @xmath47 is independent of @xmath55 , so that the last term in eq .",
    "( 6 ) may be dropped .",
    "since we are assuming that there is no matter present , that equation then takes the simple form @xmath59 , which implies that @xmath60 .",
    "we can get another relation between @xmath47 and @xmath57 from the definition of @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( 4 ) , which we can write as @xmath61 .",
    "substituting our solution for @xmath7 into this gives @xmath62 .",
    "combining the two expressions relating @xmath47 and @xmath57 gives @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "therefore @xmath65    it remains to use eq .",
    "( 8) , which tells us that @xmath66 .",
    "our solution for @xmath7 and @xmath57 gives @xmath67 . combining these gives the power @xmath68 in terms of the parameters of the model : @xmath69 note that physical quantities must depend on the combination",
    "@xmath70 since it is invariant under rescalings of the fields .",
    "let us call this combination @xmath71 .",
    "if we take @xmath72 , then @xmath73 note that the universe expands faster than @xmath74 .",
    "if there is a small amount of radiation in this cosmon - dominated universe , it will redshift as @xmath75 , whereas the  effective vacuum energy \" , @xmath7 , goes as @xmath0 .",
    "we shall find that the same is true in a radiation dominated universe with a small amount of cosmon energy : the cosmon / radiation ratio grows as a power of @xmath55 , where the power is of order @xmath71 .",
    "thus if @xmath76 , say , the cosmon energy tracks the radiation density very well over many orders of magnitude in time .    the quantity @xmath7 contains the vacuum energy @xmath34 ( i.e. the underlying cosmological constant ) and the cosmon potential energy . if one considers the full  dark \" stress energy , which includes the contributions from @xmath34 and from both the kinetic and potential energy of the cosmon , one finds that for @xmath72 , @xmath77 . in other words , all the  dark \" energy  cosmological constant plus cosmon  has an equation of state similar to radiation .",
    "what can we say about newton s constant ?",
    "the coefficient of the einstein tensor in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , which we may call @xmath78 , is given by @xmath79 , which for small @xmath71 is approximately @xmath80 .",
    "what matters , of course , is not the particular value of @xmath81 , which is just a meaningless rescaling of the planck scale , but how @xmath81 changes with time .",
    "we see that if only cosmon energy ( including @xmath3 ) is present @xmath81 is constant .",
    "we shall see shortly that when matter is present , @xmath81 changes over cosmological time scales , but very little if @xmath72 , which is the case of interest .",
    "now let us turn to the case of a radiation - dominated universe , with some cosmon energy .",
    "since radiation is dominant , one expects the scale factor to grow approximately as @xmath74 , so we take @xmath82 where @xmath83 is some time that , as we shall see , is close to when the cosmon energy is equal to the radiation energy .",
    "the power @xmath84 is negative , as is @xmath85 , so that the cosmon / radiation ratio decreases .",
    "however , since @xmath84 turns out to be of @xmath86 , the cosmon / radiation ratio will change very slowly for small @xmath71 .",
    "( 13 ) gives @xmath87    it is easy to show that the leading behavior of @xmath7 is @xmath88 , so we write @xmath89 substituting eqs . ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) into the cosmon equation of motion , eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we find @xmath90 .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) into the eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( the definition of @xmath47 ) , we find @xmath91 to leading order .",
    "considering now the trace of the gravity equation , eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we see that the leading terms on both sides go as @xmath92 .",
    "if we match only the leading terms ( which is good enough for our purposes ) , we may neglect @xmath7 , which contains only terms of order @xmath88 and higher .",
    "we may also neglect the @xmath93 on the left - hand side for the same reason . since the matter is assumed to be radiation , @xmath94 . with fields assumed to be constant in space , we need keep only time derivatives , so that eq . ( 6 ) reduces finally to the simple form @xmath95 , which gives @xmath96 . combining this with eq .",
    "( 14 ) yields @xmath97 for small @xmath71 , @xmath98 , so that @xmath99 in fact , since the leading term in einstein s equations gives @xmath100 , one has @xmath101 .",
    "the preceding calculations give the result @xmath102 .",
    "consequently , for small @xmath71 , one has @xmath103 .",
    "we see , then , that when @xmath7 is comparable to the radiation density , the terms in @xmath50 of higher order in @xmath104 are of the same size as the lower order terms , and the whole approximation scheme we have been using breaks down , as one would indeed have expected .",
    "note that the effective newton s constant in an era where radiation dominates is ( for small @xmath71 ) given by @xmath105 .",
    "that is , @xmath2 decreases very slowly , with @xmath106 ( although see the discussion in sec . 4 below ) .",
    "the mechanism we have been describing relies on the fact that the scalar curvature is a  proxy \" for the vacuum energy . however , inside a matter distribution there is also a contribution from the trace of the matter stress - energy , as shown in eq .",
    "one might worry that this would interfere with the mechanism for cancelling the cosmological constant .",
    "to study this situation , let us consider a spherical mass of radius @xmath107 , and constant density @xmath108 , surrounded by a vacuum .",
    "we take @xmath108 to be nuclear density , for specificity , and the pressure to be negligible .",
    "this mass could be a baryon , or a neutron star , for example .",
    "one might suppose that since in natural gravitational units , @xmath109 while @xmath110 , that @xmath108 would dominate the right - hand side of eq .",
    "let us make this assumption to start with , even though it will prove to be false , because it will be instructive and point us toward the right solution .    using spherical symmetry , we can write the equation of motion for the cosmon inside the mass as @xmath111 . this has the solution , @xmath112 , for @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the value of @xmath7 in the vacuum , which we have given in eq .",
    "( 10 ) . then @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath107 is the radius of a baryon , this is of order @xmath116 in natural units .",
    "even if @xmath107 is the radius of a neutron star , @xmath117 is only of order @xmath118 . now consider the quantity @xmath47 . inside the sphere of matter , @xmath119 , which for a baryon is @xmath120 and for a neutron star is @xmath121 .",
    "if our assumptions were correct , then , it would imply that @xmath122 far from the matter and @xmath123 inside .",
    "but this can not be the case , for then somewhere inside or near the matter distribution the quantity @xmath124 would have to be of order @xmath125 . for a baryon",
    "this is @xmath126 which is many orders of magnitude larger than nuclear density .",
    "that is , the last term in eq .",
    "( 6 ) would greatly dominate , contrary to our assumption .",
    "thus the assumption that @xmath108 dominates is false .",
    "this shows what the real solution of the coupled equations must look like .",
    "it must be that @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( inside matter ) so that the terms @xmath130 and @xmath131 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 6 ) cancel .",
    "then @xmath24 can have the same value inside and outside the matter distribution , allowing @xmath7 to be nearly spatially constant .",
    "consequently , @xmath132 even inside matter .",
    "this is the only way to get a self - consistent solution .",
    "the net result is the following .",
    "the effective newton s constant @xmath133 is the same everywhere , both inside baryonic matter ( or any other kind of matter ) and in the vacuum .",
    "this is what we would expect anyway from the equivalence principle .",
    "however , something very strange happens ; namely the total stress energy tensor acts like radiation , since the sum of the matter stress energy and the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , namely @xmath134 , gives something traceless .",
    "it is easy to see that if the mass of a ball of baryonic matter is @xmath135 due to @xmath136 , the total mass including the last term in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is only @xmath137 .",
    "is nt it catastrophic to have the total stress energy be traceless , even for ordinary matter ?",
    "for example , consider a box of gas .",
    "the spatial average of the pressure inside the box would be @xmath138 , where @xmath139 includes the rest energy of the gas molecules .",
    "however , it must be realized that this average pressure is almost all coming from pressure in the cosmon field _ inside the material particles_. the actual gas pressure due to particles colliding with each other is just what would be given by the kinetic theory of gases . on the other hand ,",
    "the box of gas would gravitate as though it had traceless stress energy .",
    "the cosmological solutions we have found are stable under small perturbations .",
    "this can be seen from the solution to the cosmon equation of motion given in eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "the first integral of the equation of motion depends on an integration constant denoted @xmath140 in eq .",
    "one sees that @xmath140 describes a transient term that dies away with increasing @xmath55 .",
    "the integration of eq .",
    "( 9 ) gives another integration constant that we have not shown in eq .",
    "( 10 ) . however , the exact solution approaches the one given in eq .",
    "( 10 ) for large @xmath55 .",
    "there is a simple physical reason why the solutions we have given are stable under small perturbations .",
    "imagine that @xmath7 finds itself at some @xmath55 with a somewhat smaller value than that given in eq .",
    ". then @xmath4 will also be somewhat smaller than in our solutions . that will cause the kinetic term of the cosmon to be more  stiff `` , which causes the cosmon field to roll down its potential hill more slowly than it does in our solution . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath7 is initially ' ' too small \" , it compensates by decreasing more slowly , until eventually it rejoins the asymptotic solution given in eq .",
    "( 10 ) . in the same way",
    "if @xmath7 starts off somewhat larger than the solution in eq.(10 ) , then @xmath4 is larger and the cosmon rolls down its hill faster until it rejoins the asymptotic solution",
    ".    schematic diagram of the evolution of the cosmon field in the presence of phase transitions .",
    "the solid line represents the actual evolution of the cosmon field while the dashed line is the trajectory it would assume in the absence of any phase transitions . in the above case , we have included only two phase transitions ; after both of which , the vev of the cosmon field asymptotes back to the pre - phase transition trajectory . ]",
    "this feature has an important consequence that would be helpful in making a realistic model of cosmology . in a realistic particle theory",
    "there would be phase transitions that change the vacuum energy density relatively suddenly , such as those connected with the breaking of grand unified symmetries , supersymmetry , the weak interaction symmetries , or the chiral symmetries of the quarks .",
    "thus , the cosmological  constant \" @xmath34 that has to be cancelled off by any cosmon field undergoes sudden jumps downward .",
    "the stability of our solutions allows our mechanism to accomodate these jumps .",
    "suppose that @xmath141 is evolving as shown in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , namely as @xmath0 , and suddenly a phase transition resets @xmath34 to be smaller by an amount of order @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the temperature at which the phase transition happens .",
    "now @xmath7 is of order @xmath142 , as we have seen ; and @xmath142 is of order @xmath11 .",
    "so @xmath7 will be reset downward by an amount that is of order its own size .",
    "let us suppose that it is not driven to a negative value by this , but only to a smaller positive value .",
    "then , for the reasons we have just explained , the rolling of the cosmon down its hill will be slowed until @xmath7 rejoins the asymptotic solution we have found .",
    "in fact , this could happen repeatedly at various epochs in the history of the universe : the effective vacuum energy could be repeatedly reset by phase transitions , and then after a few e - foldings in time , rejoin its asymptotic solution .",
    "fig.[figschema ] schematically illustrates the evolution of just such a cosmon field that undergoes several phase transitions . the fact that @xmath7 levels off for a period of time after a phase transition and acts more like a cosmological _ constant _ may be a possible explanation of the observed dark energy if the universe has recently undergone a phase transition .",
    "there is a complication that such an explanation would face , namely that the radiation released in the phase transition would tend to dominate over @xmath7 for a period of time .",
    "how @xmath7 and @xmath16 would behave after a phase transition is something that has to be more carefully studied numerically before one can tell if this is a viable explanation of dark energy .",
    "another effect of the phase transition would be a transient time dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that @xmath34 and therefore @xmath4 is decreased suddenly ( compared to t ) , then by the equation of motion , eq .",
    "[ scalareom ] , one expects @xmath143 to be approximately constant during this sudden decrease in r. thus , @xmath144 is driven to a smaller value than the asymptotic solution .",
    "as @xmath7 evolves to a rejoin the asymptotic solution , @xmath47 will be increasing and hence so will @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , if we are in an era where @xmath7 is  recovering \" from a phase transition ( which might explain the near constancy of @xmath7 ) , then @xmath2 might be slowly increasing .",
    "this can have implications for big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "it should be noted that if a phase transition were to drive @xmath7 negative , there would be a catastrophe : @xmath7 could not ever become positive again .",
    "rather it would roll to ever more negative values , which would make @xmath145 larger and the cosmon kinetic term _",
    "less _ stiff , so that the rolling would accelerate and @xmath7 would plunge ever faster into the abyss .",
    "however , there does not seem to be any reason why phase transitions would necessarily have to drive @xmath7 negative .",
    "whether or not one did so would depend on the parameters of the theory .",
    "there are of course many other issues that would have to be examined to see if a realistic cosmology could emerge from the toy model we have described or some similar model .",
    "we intend to return to these in the future .",
    "another very important issue is whether the kind of theory we are describing could make sense at the quantum level .",
    "one obvious issue is whether there is any fine - tuning is involved in the choice of cosmon kinetic term we have made . if one considers the effects of either matter loops or cosmon loops , these do not seem to raise any problems of fine tuning ( though we have not proved this ) .",
    "one thing that helps in this regard is that the cosmon only couples to gravity .",
    "however , simple power - counting arguments suggest that graviton loops induce a term of the form @xmath146 in addition to @xmath147",
    ". the former term would overwhelm the latter unless its coefficient were tuned to be less than about @xmath116 , i.e. about the same tuning that is involved in the cosmological constant problem itself .",
    "however , even if this is the case , that does not mean that the model achieves nothing .",
    "it seems to be a solution to the cosmological constant problem at the _ classical _ level ( whether a realistic one or not , that remains to be seen ) .",
    "that is , it can solve the  small number problem \" even if it does not solve the ",
    "fine tuning problem \" .",
    "however , any conclusions about the quantum theory are premature , as we have not studied it in detail .",
    "we have analyzed a toy model that realizes the idea of a feedback mechanism for cancelling the cosmological constant at the classical level .",
    "the model has several appealing features .",
    "first , the total  dark energy \" of vacuum energy plus cosmon field energy is always of the same order as the energy in radiation and matter .",
    "this is certainly suggestive , given the observed  cosmic coincidence \" that the dark energy is currently of the same order as the energy in particles .",
    "second , the mechanism works even if there are several phase transitions throughout the history of the universe that reset the cosmological constant . as explained in the introduction , any successful cancellation mechanism for the cosmological constant must have these features .",
    "there are also two interesting modifications of gravity .",
    "( a ) the effective newton s constant changes slightly over cosmological time scales during periods when cosmon energy is subdominant .",
    "( b ) the cosmon stress energy acts to make the total stress energy tensor approximately traceless everywhere , even inside baryonic matter .",
    "there are several aspects of the model that are less attractive .",
    "the most serious is that the scalar curvature appears ( at least effectively ) in the denominator of the cosmon kinetic term .",
    "this makes it questionable whether this model would make sense at the quantum level .",
    "moreover , naive power counting suggests that the model must be fine tuned at the one loop level by the same amount that is involved in solving the cosmological constant  by hand \" .",
    "there is also the difficulty that the rolling of the cosmon field tends to erase any dark energy that has @xmath148 just as it erases a true cosmological constant . in other words ,",
    "the cancellation mechanism works it too well ! however , after phase transitions , the cosmon field tends to stop rolling for a while , so that the  effective cosmological constant \" is approximately constant and may explain the observed dark energy if the universe has recently undergone a phase transition .",
    "this deserves further study .",
    "there are several other aspects of the model that also require further study .",
    "it must be seen what the implications of the tracelessness of the stress - energy tensor are .",
    "the cosmology of the model must be studied to see how close to being realistic it can be made . and whether the model makes sense as a quantum theory needs to be investigated .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to see if the feedback idea can be made to work in some other way that does not involve such an exotic cosmon kinetic term .",
    "we would like to thank alberto iglesias and takemichi okui for useful discussions .",
    "s.m.b . and s.p.n .",
    "were supported by the department of energy under contract de - fg02 - 91er40626 while r.j.s . was supported in part by the department of energy under contract de - fg05 - 85er40226 .",
    "the present paper is a reconsideration of ideas first presented in a 1987 paper of barr @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to point out a number of flaws in the analysis in that paper . before discussing them",
    ", one should note that in most of that paper , an auxiliary field @xmath40 was used as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) here .",
    "that is , instead of the cosmon kinetic term depending on negative powers of the scalar curvature @xmath4 , it depended on positive powers of @xmath40 , where some potential @xmath149 forced @xmath40 to be of order @xmath150 .",
    "the cosmon kinetic term assumed there was of the form @xmath151 , where @xmath152 was allowed to be a free parameter for much of the analysis , whereas in this paper we always assume that it is 2 ( in fact , it can be shown that it must be 2 for the power - law solution to dominate ) .",
    "\\(1 ) the most serious mistake in the analysis in @xcite was to assume that the scale factor of the universe went as @xmath153 .",
    "in general , as we see from eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) here , this is not the case , except in the ( unrealizable ) limit @xmath154 .",
    "the false assumption that @xmath155 together with the assumption that @xmath149 is of the form @xmath156 , led to the result ( in eq .",
    "( a15 ) of @xcite ) that @xmath157 , and ( in eq .",
    "( a10 ) of @xcite ) that the effective cosmological constant @xmath158 .",
    "so , in order to have positive newton s constant , it had to be assumed in @xcite that @xmath152 is larger than 2 , implying that @xmath7 falls off more slowly than the radiation density ( which under the assumption that @xmath159 obviously goes as @xmath0 ) .",
    "indeed , if @xmath160 , with @xmath161 , then @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "now , even though the analysis of @xcite was based on a wrong assumption about @xmath50 , and the conclusions therefore are invalid , some of those conclusions resemble the results of the correct analysis presented here . in the present paper , we also find that @xmath7 falls off slower than the radiation density . and if our parameter @xmath164 , then @xmath165 and @xmath166 .    in @xcite",
    ", it was thought that to have positive newton s constant in the case @xmath167 , a rather complicated form of @xmath149 had to be used ( see section iii of that paper ) .",
    "however , that is not the case , as we have found here .",
    "\\(2 ) another mistake in the analysis of appendix a of @xcite was in assuming that @xmath149 could have the form @xmath156 ( cf .",
    "( a2 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to an inconsistency in the analysis as one sees from eq .",
    "( a11 ) of that paper , which is @xmath168 .",
    "the left - hand side is @xmath169 , whereas the right - hand side is @xmath170 .",
    "that is why in eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the present paper we chose the form @xmath171 , which is of the form @xmath172 and does not lead to this inconsistency .",
    "\\(3 ) there is a mistake in eq .",
    "( a3 ) of @xcite , in the last term , which contains the operator @xmath173 .",
    "the factor of 2 should not be present , and the indices on @xmath174 should be symmetrized .",
    "in other words , the operator should be the same as in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of this paper .",
    "\\(4 ) the analysis of what happens inside matter was incorrect in that it assumed that the matter density dominates the right - hand side of what is eq .",
    "( 6 ) . as a result",
    ", it was thought that what we call @xmath47 here ( which corresponds to @xmath175 in @xcite if one makes use of the equation of motion for @xmath40 ) varies from being very small inside matter to being of order one outside . as was noted in @xcite , this would make the terms with second derivatives of @xmath47 ( or equivalently @xmath176 ) enormously large , so large as to dominate over the matter density . as we found here , the resolution of this apparent inconsistency is that @xmath47 inside matter is almost exactly the same as outside , but its second derivatives almost exactly cancel the trace of the stress energy tensor of the matter .",
    "this was not realized in @xcite , so that some of the discussion in section iv of that paper is incorrect .    in spite of these flaws ,",
    "most of the major conclusions of that paper stand as correct , including the following : ( i ) in the model where @xmath4 is contained in the cosmon potential newton s constant is driven to zero ; ( ii ) this problem does not arise if @xmath4 couples to the cosmon through the denominator of its kinetic term ; ( iii ) @xmath7 falls off slower than the radiation or matter density if @xmath7 dominates ; ( iv ) the feedback mechanism works even when lumps of matter are present because the cosmon field does not significantly  sag \" inside matter , and is therefore everywhere approximately equal to its value in empty space .",
    "our present analysis shows that some apparent problems discussed in @xcite are not real .",
    "most importantly , the disastrously large contributions to the stress energy coming from the second derivatives of @xmath47 ( or @xmath175 ) do not arise , and there is no difficulty in obtaining a positive newton s constant .",
