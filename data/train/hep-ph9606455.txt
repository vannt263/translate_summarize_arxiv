    "chiral symmetry restricts severely the interactions of pions , nucleons and photons @xcite .",
    "the consequences are most conveniently summarized by the use of an effective field theory , valid in the low energy regime .",
    "the simultaneous expansion in small momenta and light quark masses is known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "any parameter free prediction of chpt , to a given order in the low energy expansion , is also a prediction of low energy qcd .",
    "however , since the theory is nonrenormalizable , there appear new low energy coupling constants , which parametrize the dynamics of the underlying theory and are not fixed by the symmetry requirement . in practice , in order to make accurate predictions , some of these coupling constants must be fixed , either from experiments or from further theoretical considerations , such as resonance saturation .",
    "our ignorance about the value of these so called counter term coupling constants constitutes the main limitation of the method .    extending chpt to the baryonic sector ,",
    "there are two issues which need to be discussed further .",
    "first , the mass of the nucleon is large and does not vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "this spoils a constistent chiral power counting .",
    "the problem can be overcome by treating the nucleon as a very heavy source @xcite , or , equivalently , by performing a systematic @xmath4-expansion @xcite , @xmath5 being the nucleon mass .",
    "the expansion is known as haevy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) .",
    "the second issue i will address is the role the spin @xmath6 delta resonances play in the pion - nucleon system .",
    "the mass difference @xmath7 is not large compared to the typical low energy scale @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the singularities associated with the delta are strongly coupled .",
    "two approaches can be found in the literature .",
    "the first of these takes into account the effect of the delta ( and of other resonances ) only through contributions to the coupling constants of higher order operators in the chiral expansion @xcite .",
    "this approach is in particular well suited to derive low energy theorems .",
    "the concern , however , is that , in the physical world of nonvanishing quark masses , the perturbation series might converge slowly due to large coupling constants driven by small denominators_i.e .",
    "_ by terms proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the second approach to hbchpt includes the delta degrees of freedom explicitly @xcite .",
    "in addition to solving the problems mentioned above , this technique has the advantage that the range of applicability is in principle extended into the delta - region .",
    "however , care must be taken in order to fully implement the requirements of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the plan of the talk is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the formulation of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is briefly reviewed . in section 3 , the role of the delta resonances is critically examined .",
    "particular emphasis is put on conceptual problems concerning resonance saturation in the presence of the delta resonances .",
    "a systematic @xmath4-expansion of the @xmath9-system , based on recent work in collaboration with hemmert and holstein @xcite , is presented .",
    "two examples are given which illustrate the questions involved .",
    "we start with the relativistic formulation of chpt for the @xmath10-system and write the effective lagrangian as a string of terms @xcite @xmath11 where the superscript denotes the number of derivatives .",
    "the first term in this expansion reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the nucleon field , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the nucleon mass and axial - vector coupling constant in the chiral limit , respectively .    in the chiral limit , @xmath16 . as a consequence , the covariant derivative on @xmath13 counts as order one ( @xmath17 denotes a generic soft momentum ) @xmath18 therefore , the loop - expansion is not equivalent to a low - energy expansion @xcite , as in the goldstone boson sector @xcite .",
    "the problem can be overcome by going to the extreme nonrelativistic limit @xcite .",
    "the idea is to move the @xmath14-dependence from the propagator to the vertices .",
    "one way to achieve this is to decompose the nucleon four - momentum according to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a soft residual momentum .",
    "the upper component of the nucleon field in its restframe , @xmath21 , defined by ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 obeys @xmath24 .",
    "the derivative on the field @xmath21 is thus of order @xmath17 .",
    "writing the effective lagrangian in terms of fields @xmath21 only ensures a consistent low energy expansion .",
    "the leading order term becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the pauli - lubanski spin vector .",
    "the propagator reads @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the low energy expansion of the @xmath10-system so obtained is a simultaneous expansion in @xmath29 this is most easily seen by using a path integral formulation where the heavy degrees of freedom , @xmath30 , are systematically integrated out @xcite .",
    "the approach also shows , that some of the low energy coupling constants must have some specified values , otherwise the theory would not be lorentz invariant @xcite .",
    "the last observation can alternatively be derived by employing reparametrization invariance @xcite .",
    "renormalization at the one - loop level ( up to order @xmath31 ) is thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "the spin 3/2 resonances @xmath1(1232 ) play a special role in the @xmath10-system . whenever delta exchange contributes to a given obsevable ( not forbidden by quantum numbers )",
    "the effect is large .",
    "the mass difference @xmath32 is small and of the same order as a typical low energy scale , e.g. @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the delta resonances can not be treated as heavy compared to the nucleon .",
    "the concept of resonance saturation is in this case at least questionable and it s applicability warrants further discussion .    in order to formulate the problem more precisely ,",
    "consider the magnetic polarizability of the nucleon in hbchpt .",
    "it has a low energy expansion of the form ( modulo logarithms of @xmath0 ) @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a heavy scale and the @xmath35 are dimensionless constants .",
    "this expansion is well suited to derive low - energy theorems ( let)@xcite , valid in the chiral limit , i.e. @xmath36 in the physical world of finite quark masses , however , the series ( [ betaexp ] ) might converge slowly , due to large coefficients @xmath35 .",
    "consider the effect of delta exchange on @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "if we shrink the delta propagator to a point , the constants @xmath35 will pick contributions of the form @xmath38    where i have inserted @xmath39 as a typical hadronic scale . in such a circumstance , the individual terms in the bracket in ( [ betaexp ] ) are all of order one and it will be necessary to resum the series .",
    "the whole point is that the scale @xmath1 appears in the denominator , not @xmath40 .",
    "if we consider the limit @xmath41 , we also have to let @xmath42 , with @xmath1 fixed .",
    "the contribution of the delta to @xmath10-processes via exchange graphs does not exhaust the low energy manifestations of the delta s .",
    "receive also contributions from meson resonance exchange in the t - channel , see @xcite , sect . 3.4 .",
    "] there are further nearby singularities generated by loop - graphs , as shown in fig .",
    "2 a ) . in the conventional formulation of hbchpt",
    ", such graphs should be accounted for in the relativistic framework @xcite .",
    "however , as there is no consistent powercounting in this framework , one might consider even higher loop graphs , as shown in fig .",
    "it is presently not clear how in this instance resonance saturation of counterterms can be formulated in a systematic manner .",
    "the conceptual problems just described are related to the fact that the delta resonances ( and also the nucleon ! ) contain both , heavy and light degrees of freedom .",
    "the light components of the delta resonances decouple only in the strict chiral limit @xcite .",
    "jenkins and manohar have included the baryon decuplet as dynamical degree of freedom in the formulation of hbchpt right from the beginning @xcite . here",
    "i will describe recent work in collaboration with hemmert and holstein @xcite , where we show explicitly , by means of a systematic @xmath4-expansion , how the framework of @xcite can be obtained from the relativistic formulation of the @xmath43 interactions .",

    "the pion fields are contained in @xmath47 and @xmath48 denotes the covariant derivative on the spin 3/2 field .",
    "the first two pieces in ( [ eq : lambda ] ) are the kinetic and mass terms of a free rarita - schwinger spinor @xcite .",
    "the remaining terms constitute the most general chiral invariant couplings to pions .",
    "the next step consists of identifying the light and heavy degrees of freedom of the spin 3/2 fields , respectively .",
    "the procedure is analogous to the case of spin 1/2 fields @xcite , but technically more complicated due to the off - shell spin 1/2 degrees of freedom of the rarita - schwinger field . in order",
    "to get rid of the mass dependence in ( [ eq : lambda ] ) we introduce the spin 3/2 projection operator for fields with _ fixed velocity _ @xmath49 @xmath50 and identify the light degrees of freedom via @xmath51 these fields coincide with the decuplet fields used in @xcite and satisfy @xmath52 .",
    "the remaining components , denoted collectively by @xmath53 , are heavy and will be integrated out .",
    "however , the effects of these degrees of freedom are included as they will give rise to @xmath4-corrections .",
    "we now perform a systematic @xmath4-expansion , in analogy to the heavy nucleon formalism @xcite .",
    "we write the most general lagrangian as ( suppressing all indices ) @xmath54 with @xmath55    the matrices @xmath56 , @xmath57 , ... ,",

    "@xmath1 and @xmath0 are of comparable magnitude .",
    "we therefore adhere to a simultaneous expansion in both quantities .",
    "it is only through this (  small scale  ) expansion that we obtain a systematic expansion of the @xmath9-system .    to make this more explicit ,",

    "explicit expressions for the expansions of @xmath68 , @xmath69 etc . can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 start at order @xmath71 .",
    "the final step is again in analogy to the case where only nucleons were considered .",
    "shifting variables and completing the square we obtain the effective action @xmath72 \\right\\ } \\label{seff}\\ ] ] with ( i keep only leading order terms in @xmath4 here , for the sake of simplicity ) @xmath73 the new terms in proportion to @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given entirely in terms of coupling constants of the lagrangian for relativistic fields .",
    "this guarantees reparameterization invariance @xcite and lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "also , these terms are @xmath4 suppressed .",
    "the effects of the heavy degrees of freedom ( both spin 3/2 and 1/2 ) thus show up only at order @xmath76 .",
    "note also that the effective @xmath77- , @xmath78- and @xmath79-interactions all contain contributions from both heavy @xmath13- and @xmath1-exchange respectively .    in the above formalism",
    ", it is understood that one has to include also the most general counterterm lagrangian consistent with chiral symmetry , lorentz invariance , and the discrete symmetries p and c , in relativistic formulation .",
    "the construction yields then automatically the contributions to matrices @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . in order to calculate a given process to order @xmath61",
    ", it then suffices to construct matrices @xmath80 to the same order , @xmath61 , @xmath81 to order @xmath83 , and @xmath82 to order @xmath84 .",
    "finally one has to add all loop - graphs contributing at the order one is working .",
    "the relevant diagrams can be found by straightforward power counting in @xmath62 .",
    "in this section i discuss two simple applications in order to illustrate some important features of the formalism .",
    "consider first the nucleon mass to order @xmath85 in the low scale expansion .",
    "starting from ( [ seff ] ) it is easily shown that , compared to the order @xmath86 calculation in conventional hbchpt , the only new contribution to the selfenergy is due to the diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 a ) , where the @xmath1-propagator denotes the propagation of the light degrees of freedom @xmath87 .",
    "the result has been given already in @xcite , the interpretation , however , is completely different .",
    "thus @xmath88 where @xmath89 in ( [ mn ] ) i have absorbed terms in proportion to @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the counterterms @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "these effects are unobservable as long as only the nucleon mass shift is considered .",
    "note , however , that the conterterm @xmath93 appaers also in the pion - nucleon sigma term .",
    "the function @xmath94 has the small @xmath95 expansion @xmath96 which shows explicitly the decoupling of the delta resonances in the chiral limit .",
    "consider now the function @xmath94 for physical masses @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "each individual term in ( [ defr ] ) is of order @xmath85 , and @xmath94 suffers from large cancellations .",
    "numerically we find @xmath99 .",
    "this corresponds to a nucleon mass shift of @xmath100 , comparable to the @xmath101 shift coming from the term in proportion to @xmath102 .",
    "finally , we can study the convergence of the chiral expansion by taking into account only the leading term of order @xmath103 in ( [ rexp ] ) .",
    "this approximation yields again @xmath104 , i.e. the higher order terms in r can safely be neglected .",
    "we conclude that , for the nucleon mass , it is sufficient to work to order @xmath105 in the chiral expansion . note , however , that the low scale expansion presented here treats effects of comparable size , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , at the same order of the expansion , viz .",
    "@xmath85 . not surprisingly , this in general improves the convergence of the perturbation series .    as a second example i consider neutral pion photoproduction at threshold . to order @xmath86 ,",
    "the electric dipole amplitude obeys the let @xcite @xmath106\\mu + { \\cal o}(\\mu^2 ) \\right\\ } \\label{let}\\ ] ] with @xmath107 as well as @xmath108 the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton and @xmath109 the strong pion - nucleon coupling constant . recently",
    "an order @xmath105 calculation has been presented @xcite which reconciles the theoretical prediction with experiment @xcite . however , each term in the expansion of @xmath110 is large with alternating sign , thus making the convergence of this particular quantity very slow .",
    "including now the delta degrees of freedom and working to order @xmath85 , there are no loop graphs with intermediate deltas contributing at threshold .",
    "however , there is a new contribution via the pole graph of fig .",
    "3 , where both vertices are of order @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath111 coupling stems from the counterterm lagrangian @xmath112    where i have indicated by the arrow its contribution to @xmath113 in ( [ seff ] ) .",
    "the so called off - shell parameter y does not contribute , as it is nonleading in @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath114-vertex in fig .",
    "3 arises from a @xmath4-correction contained in @xmath115 of ( [ atilde ] ) and is in proportion to @xmath116 .",
    "the net result is @xmath117 in the chiral limit , this result scales like @xmath102 , i.e. the corresponding photoproduction amplitude is of order @xmath105 .",
    "there are _ many _ other terms of this order , but ( [ e0+new ] ) is the _ only _ term which is of order @xmath85 .",
    "the let of ( [ let ] ) is , of course , not violated by this term .",
    "numerically , the term ( [ e0+new ] ) turns out to be small . using the coupling constant @xmath118",
    "as determined in @xcite , @xmath119 , and employing the experimental result @xmath120 , the expansion of @xmath121 reads @xmath122 where the second and third term in the brackets are the order @xmath31 and order @xmath105(@xmath85 ) terms respectively .",
    "this result is far off the number extracted @xcite from the most recent experiment @xcite , @xmath123 .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to calculate the next term in this expansion . also , it will be most interesting to consider the energy dependence of @xmath121 away from threshold .",
    "work in this direction is under progress .",
    "heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is a powerful tool to study the low energy interactions of pions , nucleons and photons .",
    "the spin 3/2 delta resonances influence the effective low energy theory substantially , due to the small mass difference @xmath124 .",
    "the convergence of the chiral expansion can be studied by comparing hbchpt without explicit spin 3/2 delta degrees of freedom with the low scale expansion sketched in section 3 .",
    "this formalism treats all effects of the deltas , on- and off - shell , in a systematic manner and allows in particular to calculate @xmath4-corrections in a consistent way . the many processes to which hbchpt has already been applied are all well suited to be treated by the formalism presented here .",
    "apart from phenomenological applications , further directions of interest are the generalization to chiral su(3 ) , the complete one - loop renormalization at the level of the functional integral as well as a better understanding of the role of yet higher resonances .",
