    "in recent work  @xcite we studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the heisenberg edwards - anderson spin glass model in three dimensions following a sudden quench to its low temperature phase . here we continue our investigations of the nonequilibrium , low temperature dynamics of this model by analyzing its behavior in more complex protocols , similar to those performed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we consider in detail the effects of a temperature cycle ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cycle ] ) consisting of the following three steps :    1 .",
    "quench the system from @xmath0 to a temperature @xmath1 at time @xmath2 , and wait a time @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   then change the temperature to a lower value @xmath4 and wait a further time @xmath5 .",
    "3 .   at total time",
    "@xmath6 change the temperature back to @xmath1 .",
    "this temperature cycling protocol has been used extensively to characterize several spin glass systems  @xcite , and these studies motivated similar cycling experiments on many different types of glassy materials  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of temperature shifts and cycles in the ising version of the model have been reported  @xcite , and temperature cycles have been discussed theoretically  @xcite .",
    "however , the heisenberg spin glass model has been much less studied than its ising counterpart , even though it is closer to many of the experimentally studied spin glass systems , and only a few aging studies exist  @xcite . in particular , extensive studies of temperature cycles have not been reported ( see ref .",
    "[ ] for preliminary results ) and we attempt here to fill this gap .",
    "the heisenberg spin glass model that we study has the hamiltonian @xmath7 where the sum is over nearest neighbors of a cubic lattice of linear size @xmath8 with periodic boundary conditions , the @xmath9 are three - component vectors of unit length and coupling constants are drawn from a symmetric gaussian distribution of standard deviation unity .",
    "we refer to our previous paper  @xcite for the technical details concerning our simulations . when performing temperature cycles a large number of parameters can be varied , implying a larger numerical effort than was needed in the simple aging studies of ref .",
    "[ ] .    the basic quantity we measure is the two - time autocorrelation function of the spins , @xmath10 , defined by @xmath11 where the brackets indicate an average over both thermal histories and disorder .",
    "to compare with experiment we often plot instead @xmath12 since this is expected to have similar behavior to the ac magnetic susceptibility at frequency @xmath13 .    a representative sample of our results for a temperature cycle is shown in fig .",
    "[ cycle ] . for @xmath14",
    "this is just a ` simple aging ' experiment corresponding to quenching the system infinitely fast from an infinite to a low temperature , @xmath15 .",
    "physical quantities then slowly relax towards equilibrium , which is known as aging .",
    "we have characterized this behavior in detail in ref .",
    "[ ] .    for @xmath16 ,",
    "during which the temperature is @xmath17 , the signal just after the shift is not a simple continuation of the decay at the previous temperature .",
    "the system has apparently forgotten it is already ` old ' and it seems therefore ` rejuvenated ' by the temperature change . in experiments performed on heisenberg spin glasses , when @xmath18 is sufficiently large , the signal obtained after the shift can be exactly superposed on the one obtained after a direct quench from @xmath0 to @xmath19 , implying that the system behaves as if it had fully forgotten the time spent at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "we will call this situation ` full rejuvenation ' . however , rejuvenation is not full in our simulations because the change in @xmath20 with time during the part of the temperature cycle at @xmath4 is less than the change found in a direct quench to @xmath4 , which is shown by the long - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ cycle ] .",
    "since we do not observe full rejuvenation we will need to ask whether the observed behavior is rejuvenation at all or whether it can be fully explained in terms of the cumulative aging scenario , discussed below in sec .",
    "[ cumag ] .",
    "we will also investigate the possible origins of this significant difference between numerical and experimental results , and will discuss in particular the role of finite cooling rates in experiments in secs .",
    "[ direct ] and [ disc : fullrejuv ] .    finally , in the third part of the experiment , @xmath21 , the relaxation proceeds , after a short transient , as if the second step had not occurred .",
    "the system has kept a ` memory ' of the first aging step despite the strong restart observed in the second part of the protocol . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ cycle ] , we show that the third part of the experiment appears to be the simple continuation of the first part , as if the second step had not taken place , which we call a ` perfect memory effect ' .",
    "this figure is not entirely convincing , though , because the signal is nearly flat and small deviations from perfect memory could be invisible on that scale . that memory is indeed close to perfect , at least for large temperature shifts , will be more quantitatively demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ memory ] .    in the rest of this work ,",
    "we analyze in more detail the rejuvenation and memory effects seen in fig .",
    "[ cycle ] .",
    "section [ cumag ] gives some theoretical background on the cumulative aging scenario , according to which the effects seen are simply due to changes in the rate of growth of correlations with temperature .",
    "our data on rejuvenation and memory are described in secs .  [ rejuvenation ] and  [ memory ] respectively .",
    "we discuss our results in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , and give a final summary in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "an important theoretical concept in understanding non - equilibrium data for spin glasses is that of a dynamical correlation length , @xmath22 , which describes the spatial extent of spin correlations after aging a time @xmath23 at temperature @xmath24 . in the cumulative aging scenario",
    ", it is proposed that the observed phenomena can be understood solely in terms of the time and temperature dependences of @xmath25 .",
    "we now discuss the predictions of cumulative aging , first for the step down in temperature from @xmath1 to @xmath4 which can lead to rejuvenation , and then for the subsequent step back up to @xmath1 which can lead to memory .",
    "if the correlation length grows to a value @xmath26 by waiting a time @xmath3 at @xmath1 , then one would have to wait a longer time , @xmath27 , at the lower temperature @xmath4 to get the same correlation length , where this ` effective age ' in the cumulative aging scenario is given by @xmath28 if the growth law @xmath22 is known accurately , eq .",
    "( [ teffeq ] ) can be used to determine @xmath27 for given values of @xmath29 and @xmath3 .    in practice",
    "one can try to fit the data for @xmath30 during the time spent at @xmath4 to data for @xmath31 , i.e.  data in a single quench to @xmath4 for some waiting time @xmath32 with @xmath33 used as a free fitting parameter .",
    "in other words @xmath33 is determined from matching both sides of the following equation , @xmath34    one of the following scenarios might then occur .",
    "a first possibility is that @xmath35 which corresponds to full rejuvenation .",
    "the time spent at @xmath1 is irrelevant for aging at @xmath4 .",
    "this is seen experimentally for large temperature shifts , but not in any of our simulations .",
    "second , one might find that @xmath36 where @xmath27 is given by eq .",
    "( [ teffeq ] ) .",
    "this is the so - called cumulative aging scenario .",
    "we shall see in sec .",
    "[ memory_heis ] that this case describes our simulations when the temperature difference @xmath18 is small , though we show in sec .  [ rej_data ] that it does not work when @xmath37 is large . however , eq .  ( [ tprimetf ] )",
    "does not correspond to rejuvenation .",
    "rather , rejuvenation is defined to be the additional effect beyond eq .",
    "( [ tprimetf ] ) , since the latter simply reflects the change in the rate of growth of the correlation length with temperature .",
    "a third possibility is that @xmath38 this is one way in which partial rejuvenation could occur , and is seen in some experiments  @xcite at intermediate values of the temperature shift .",
    "however our simulations do not fit this scenario .",
    "rather , for large values of @xmath18 we will see in sec .",
    "[ rej_data ] that our data can not be collapsed on to data for a direct quench by shifting the time .",
    "hence the effective age @xmath33 can not be defined in our simulations at large temperature differences , and so our results in this region do not fit any of the above scenarios .    remark that if @xmath3 and @xmath37 are sufficiently large , @xmath27 will be much larger than @xmath3 .",
    "one can make this statement more quantitative by assuming , as usual , that equilibration proceeds by activation over barriers , where the barrier height @xmath39 is some function of the length scale @xmath40 .",
    "writing @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a microscopic attempt time which we set to 1 , eq .",

    "although the reasoning leading to eqs .",
    "( [ t1lnt1 ] ) and ( [ teffcumt1 ] ) is for a particular simple model of the growth of the correlation length , we expect the result @xmath46 to be more generally correct .      in a similar way we can fit the data for @xmath47 after the step back up to @xmath1 to data for @xmath48 , @xmath49 assuming that the two functions of @xmath23 in this expression can be matched for a particular choice of @xmath33 .",
    "if memory is perfect then @xmath50 so that the time spent at @xmath4 simply plays no role in the subsequent aging at @xmath1 .    in the cumulative aging scenario @xmath51 where @xmath52 in which @xmath53 is the time the system would have to age at @xmath4 to get the correlation length it reached at @xmath1 after time @xmath3 .",
    "it is given implicitly by @xmath54 as in eq .",
    "( [ teffeq ] ) above .",
    "this is shown graphically for a set of experimental parameters in fig .",
    "[ th ] below .",
    "it is worth mentioning that at extremely long times or for very large changes in temperature one expects perfect memory even in the cumulative aging scenario .",
    "this is because , at long times , growth of @xmath40 with time at the lower temperature @xmath4 is much slower than at @xmath1 , so @xmath53 is huge , the difference @xmath55 is small , and hence @xmath27 is small . as in sec .",
    "[ cumagt1 ] , we can make this more quantitative within a barrier activation model for which eqs .",
    "( [ xi1 ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) imply @xmath56 we expect perfect memory if @xmath57 since @xmath58 , from eq .",
    "( [ t2lnt ] ) this gives @xmath59 eq .",
    "( [ tggt2 ] ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath60 since eliminating of @xmath53 from eqs .",
    "( [ t2lnt2 ] ) and ( [ t2lnt ] ) , gives @xmath61   \\ , , \\ ] ] assuming @xmath62 .",
    "hence , if eq .",
    "( [ memperf ] ) is satisfied , one has perfect memory in the cumulative aging scenario .",
    "this conclusion should again be more general than the particular barrier activation model we used .",
    "now we discuss in detail our results for the behavior following the temperature drop to @xmath4 and their interpretation .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ cycle ] that aging is strongly restarted when temperature changes from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , but that , unlike in experiments , the effect is weaker than when the system is directly quenched to @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ rejuv ] we show the systematic trend in the data when we vary the time @xmath3 spent at the upper temperature @xmath1 .",
    "two important pieces of information can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ rejuv ] .    *",
    "the case of @xmath65 corresponds to a direct quench from @xmath66 to @xmath19 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ rejuv ] that the signal obtained after waiting for a finite value of @xmath3 at @xmath67 is different from the signal obtained in a direct quench and differs more as @xmath3 is increased . in ` full rejuvenation ' , as seen in experiments , the data after waiting a time @xmath3 is the same as in a direct quench .",
    "we were not able to vary parameters of temperature cycles in such a way that full rejuvenation is observed in our simulations .",
    "* when @xmath3 increases , the signal saturates to a limiting behavior .",
    "this is actually the region in which the intermediate part of fig .",
    "[ cycle ] was obtained , since @xmath3 is quite large there .",
    "this saturation implies that even if we were able to equilibrate the system at temperature @xmath1 , it would undergo aging when further quenched to @xmath4 .",
    "this is very different from the behavior of a pure ferromagnet , for instance , which would reequilibrate on a microscopic timescale upon a similar temperature change within its ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we have therefore seen that rejuvenation is not full .",
    "we will now argue that it is not null either and that there is an additional signal beyond that expected in the cumulative aging scenario discussed in sec .",
    "[ cumag ] . to do",
    "so it is useful to look at the dependence of @xmath68 on frequency , or equivalently the dependence of the two - time autocorrelation function on the time difference @xmath69 .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ reju ] show data for this quantity .",
    "the system has spent a large time @xmath70 at @xmath71 , sufficiently large that the data in fig .",
    "[ reju ] has become independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the different curves are for different values of @xmath23 , the time waited at @xmath64 , increasing from @xmath72 to @xmath73 in a logarithmic progression .",
    "the curves do not superpose and the behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ reju ] is qualitatively similar to that obtained in simple aging experiments where samples undergo a rapid quench to the spin glass phase .",
    "there is a first , fast stationary decay of the autocorrelation functions followed by a second , much slower , age - dependent decay .",
    "however , there is a quantitative difference since the precise shape of the data is actually not the same as in a direct quench to @xmath4 .",
    "the difference can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ reju ] by comparing the solid with the dashed lines , which are for a direct quench with various waiting times . in the direct quench",
    ", the correlation function decays faster at long time differences .",
    "for the temperature shift to @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ cycle ] , we have seen in fig .  [ reju ] that the shape of the extra signal due to this shift is different from the result of a direct quench to @xmath4 .",
    "we also need to ask whether the magnitude of the extra signal is greater than that expected in the cumulative aging scenario discussed in sec .",
    "[ cumag ] .    in fig .",
    "[ cycle ] , the time @xmath74 is large , since the data in fig .",
    "[ rejuv ] has saturated for this value of @xmath3 , and the temperature shift @xmath18 is large . hence , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ cumagt1 ] , the effective age in the cumulative aging scenario is enormous , and the time dependence of @xmath75 should be tiny in this scenario . this is clearly not the case for the data in fig .",
    "[ cycle ] .",
    "we conclude that for large temperature shifts there is genuine rejuvenation ; the cumulative aging scenario does not work .",
    "in addition , the fact that the data of fig .",
    "[ reju ] is independent of @xmath3 , at large @xmath3 , for all @xmath76 , implies that the above conclusion on the existence of rejuvenation holds for any frequency @xmath13 accessible in our simulations .",
    "we note that the use of a different ` clock ' to determine effective ages could lead to the wrong impression that we observe full ( or close to full ) rejuvenation  @xcite .",
    "if one follows a common experimental procedure and defines @xmath33 as the location of a peak in the logarithmic derivative of the two - time autocorrelation function , @xmath77 , one obtains a very small effective age from the data of fig .",
    "[ reju ] and then conclude that rejuvenation is almost full . we know , however , for example by comparing the shapes of the solid and dashed curves in fig",
    ".  [ reju ] , that this is not the case .",
    "hence @xmath78 can not be used to quantify rejuvenation in numerical simulations of temperature shifts .",
    "this remark was already made for the ising spin glass in ref .",
    "[ ] , although in a less detailed way .",
    "data for a range of temperature shifts is presented in fig .",
    "we see that the amplitude of the restart of aging is strongly dependent on the amplitude of the temperature shift .",
    "the case where @xmath79 has no restart of aging and corresponds to a simple quench to @xmath4 ( with the plot starting at waiting time @xmath3 ) . for @xmath80",
    "there is an additional decay of @xmath81 due to the temperature shift .",
    "we shall see in sec .",
    "[ memory_heis ] that this effect is describable by cumulative aging for small temperature shifts , unlike the situation for large temperature shifts discussed earlier in this section .    as a final comment",
    ", we note that the restart of aging observed in the second part of the cycle shown in fig .",
    "[ cycle ] is not an artifact produced by our choice of @xmath82 as a physical observable , as suggested in refs .",
    "it is certainly true that the susceptibility , defined by eq .",
    "( [ sus ] ) and the correlation function are not related by a fluctuation - dissipation relation since the system is not in equilibrium , and so rejuvenation effects might appear to be stronger using one or the other observable .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ reju ] leaves us with no doubt concerning the fact that aging is restarted in a shift .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss our results about rejuvenation effects from a theoretical point of view .",
    "as already mentioned , the growth of correlations with time is characterized by a dynamical correlation length @xmath25 .",
    "lengthscales that are active at @xmath1 in a given time window @xmath23 , @xmath83 , are typically larger than the ones active at @xmath84 in the same time window , @xmath85 .",
    "although @xmath22 is only a gradual function of @xmath24 at fixed time @xmath23 , @xmath40 grows very slowly ( presumably logarithmically ) with @xmath23 and so it can take an astronomical amount of time to relax excitations of size @xmath86 at the lower temperature @xmath4 .",
    "roughly speaking , changing the temperature gives only a modest change in length scales but a huge change in time scales .",
    "for practical purposes , excitations of size @xmath86 are frozen at @xmath4 and dynamics at @xmath4 is due to fluctuations at the smaller length scale @xmath87 , which had easily reached quasi - equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "rejuvenation therefore means that equilibrium states at @xmath1 and @xmath4 are significantly ` different ' on length scales of the order of @xmath87 .",
    "what ` different ' really means will be the subject of this subsection .",
    "theoretically two explicit examples of this difference have been discussed in the literature :    1 .",
    "temperature chaos in the scaling picture of spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of the exponent of the power - law decay of spatial correlations in the two - dimensional non - disordered xy model  @xcite .    in the temperature chaos scenario ,",
    "spin orientations are spatially uncorrelated beyond an overlap length , @xmath88 , which diverges when @xmath89 but is small at large temperature differences , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is an exponent quantifying chaos .",
    "chaos can therefore naturally explain full rejuvenation if @xmath92 because equilibrium states at the two temperatures are uncorrelated at the important length scale of @xmath87 . as a consequence , aging at @xmath1 is unable to bring the system closer to equilibrium at @xmath4 . in the opposite situation , @xmath93 , called `",
    "weak chaos ' , a smaller but non - zero rejuvenation signal should be observed  @xcite , since there are some rare regions of space , occurring with probability @xmath94 , which are affected by the temperature change .    in the two - dimensional non - disordered xy model below its kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath95 , equilibrium spin correlations decay with a power of the distance @xmath96 , @xmath97 where the exponent @xmath98 depends continuously on @xmath24 .",
    "this is because there is a line of critical points for @xmath99 .",
    "hence , when temperature is changed from @xmath1 to @xmath4 all length scales have to readjust to the new critical point  @xcite , whatever the time spent at @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly this produces a rejuvenation signal which is not full but becomes gradually larger when @xmath37 is increased  @xcite .",
    "we now investigate which of these two scenarios corresponds most closely to our simulations . in ref .",
    "[ ] we showed that spatial spin glass correlations at short distances , @xmath100 , are well - described by algebraic decays with a temperature dependent exponent , @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) below ) , just as in the two - dimensional xy model .",
    "moreover , the rejuvenation effect we observe in the present study has the same characteristics as the one found in the xy model , since it is never full but becomes gradually larger when @xmath37 is increased . as for the ising spin glass model",
    "@xcite this shows that the rejuvenation signal observed in simulations is largely due the temperature dependence of spatial correlations via the exponent @xmath103 .    it remains to ask , though , whether there are additional rejuvenation effects observed in our simulations due to temperature chaos . in refs .",
    "[ ] , it was argued that the answer for three and four dimensional ising spin glasses is ` no ' .",
    "the reason is that chaotic effects with temperature are very hard to detect presumably because the overlap length is never small in ising systems  @xcite .",
    "however , equilibrium calculations for vector spins suggest that overlap lengths should be smaller in the heisenberg case  @xcite , while dynamic length scales are larger than in the ising model  @xcite .",
    "hence it appears potentially easier to detect chaotic temperature effects in heisenberg systems than in ising systems  @xcite , so this possibility needs to be investigated .    to do so we follow ref .  [ ] and consider a two - site , two - replica correlation function , @xmath104 where the two replicas @xmath105 and @xmath106 have the same interactions but age independently at different temperatures , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , with @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath110 then the overlap between the spin configurations in the two replicas becomes small in a simulation on timescale @xmath23 .    in fig .",
    "[ chaos ] we show our results for the heisenberg model with the same two temperatures @xmath111 and @xmath112 used in our previous cycles .",
    "data is presented for the two - replica correlators in three different cases .",
    "* @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , noted `` @xmath1 '' .",
    "* @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , noted `` @xmath4 '' .",
    "* @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , noted `` mixt '' .",
    "the simulation times have been chosen so that @xmath121 .",
    "this equality can be seen in fig .",
    "[ chaos ] because the correlation functions `` @xmath1 '' and `` @xmath4 '' are parallel in this log - lin representation at large @xmath96 .",
    "by contrast these curves have a different slope at small @xmath96 because short distance behavior is characterized by the temperature dependent exponent @xmath103 discussed above .",
    "since the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath4 are very different , we need to take into account the overall increase of spin glass order as the temperature is lowered  @xcite .",
    "we therefore also plot @xmath122 , which is called `` @xmath123 '' in fig .",
    "[ chaos ] .",
    "we find that `` mixt '' and `` @xmath123 '' are equal within our numerical precision , the result expected in the absence of chaos .",
    "we conclude that even weak chaotic effects are not detectable in our numerical simulations despite large temperature jumps , @xmath124 , and large dynamic lengthscales , see the range for @xmath96 in fig .",
    "[ chaos ] .",
    "the dynamic rejuvenation effects we observe can therefore be attributed entirely to the temperature dependence of the exponent @xmath103 describing the power law decay of spatial correlations at distances less than @xmath25 .",
    "of course temperature chaos could still exist at larger length scales .",
    "although the timescales of experiments ( relative to the microscopic time ) are much longer than in simulations , the difference in length scales is not so pronounced , as we shall emphasize in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "hence we feel it is unlikely that strong temperature chaos occurs in experiment either .",
    "unfortunately , this is difficult to check since direct probes of length scales related to chaos effects are not experimentally feasible . as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ disc : fullrejuv ] , the experimental observation of full rejuvenation does not in itself prove that a strongly chaotic situation is reached in experiments .      to our knowledge ,",
    "full rejuvenation has never been found in numerical studies even in large temperature shifts , in contrast to experiments which do find full rejuvenation .",
    "one difference in procedures is that temperature changes in simulations are instantaneous , whereas they can only take place at a finite rate in experiments .",
    "we therefore need to study whether correlations built up during gradual cooling are relevant to the subsequent dynamics .",
    "if chaos were important in the simulations , the answer would presumably be no , since growth of correlations with time has to restart from scratch at each temperature . however , as we showed in sec .",
    "[ secchaos ] , no chaos effects are seen in our simulations .",
    "hence we need to consider the effects of gradual changes in temperature , to see whether these modified protocols improve agreement with experiment .",
    "firstly , rather than quenching from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , we consider the effect of taking a finite initial temperature , @xmath125 .",
    "this protocol allows us to investigate the effect of building spatial correlations at high temperatures on the aging dynamics at lower temperature .",
    "our results for various @xmath126 are presented in fig .",
    "[ quench ] where we have adopted the following procedure .",
    "the temperature is quenched from @xmath0 to @xmath126 where it is kept constant for @xmath127 sweeps after which the temperature is instantaneously quenched to the final temperature @xmath128 .    for initial temperatures larger than @xmath129 the",
    "aging observed at @xmath128 is similar to the one observed in a quench from @xmath130 .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath131 aging is affected .",
    "in particular the total amplitude of the relaxation , @xmath132 is greatly reduced when @xmath126 decreases .",
    "we then use eq .",
    "( [ amplitude ] ) to compare the aging dynamics in various protocols . from fig .",
    "[ rejuv ] we find that the ratio of the amplitude of relaxation in a truly direct quench to the amplitude in a @xmath133 shift is about 5 while full rejuvenation would imply that this ratio is 1 . if , however , one compares the @xmath133 shift to a direct quench from a finite temperature , say from @xmath134 , to @xmath135 , this ratio becomes @xmath136 , i.e.  closer to the full rejuvenation result . we conclude that spending some time at high temperatures makes the rejuvenation signal closer to what is observed experimentally , though we still do not see full rejuvenation .    in real experiments , not only is the initial temperature finite , as above , but also the cooling from @xmath126 to @xmath1 is not instantaneous . therefore not only does the system build correlations at high temperature @xmath126 , but it also has some dynamics at all temperatures intermediate between @xmath126 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is likely to influence even more the aging dynamics at the final temperature .    to investigate this point",
    "we have performed simulations of temperature cycles using finite cooling rates .",
    "we repeated the temperature cycles of sec .",
    "[ introduction ] using a realistic protocol .",
    "the system is first quenched from @xmath0 to @xmath137 where it is kept constant during @xmath127 sweeps .",
    "then the temperature is decreased at a finite cooling rate , @xmath138 , so that the time evolution of the temperature is of the form @xmath139 .",
    "the cooling is stopped at @xmath63 for a time @xmath3 , after which the temperature is decreased to @xmath64 at the same cooling rate @xmath138 .",
    "we simulated cycles with two different cooling rates , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( cooling rates are expressed in units of @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the variance of the distribution of coupling constants in eq .",

    "these values were chosen to give cooling times comparable to @xmath145 , as in experiments  @xcite .",
    "we find that a finite cooling rate has two effects :    1 .",
