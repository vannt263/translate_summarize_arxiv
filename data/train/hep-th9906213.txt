    "the basic @xmath0 higgs model  @xcite in 4 minkowskian dimensions supports instanton solutions in euclidean spacetime , that are evaluated numerically  @xcite .",
    "this model is arrived at by dimensional descent from the 8 dimensional yang ",
    "mills action  @xcite stabilised by the 4-th chern class .",
    "it is also expected that in the static limit this system supports sphaleron solutions , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite where such solutions were however not evaluated numerically .",
    "subsequently , in a different context , monopole solutions to a generalised @xmath2 higgs model ( generalising the georgi  glashow model in 3 dimensions ) were numerically  @xcite evaluated , which happen to describe the sphaleron solution of the 4 dimensional @xmath0 higgs model concerning us in the present work .",
    "we will explain this connection here and will construct the finite energy path between two topologically distinct vacua describing the geometric non contractible loop ( ncl )  @xcite , with the sphaleron of chern  simons number @xmath1 at its top .",
    "these are the results reported in the present note . before proceeding to these technical tasks ,",
    "we note some properties of this model and its extensions , which may be of some physical relevance .",
    "there are two distinct physical justifications for studying this model and some extensions .",
    "the first is that some extended versions of it , which certainly  @xcite support instantons , are capable of describing a coulomb gas of instantons .",
    "this allows the attempt at extending the work of polyakov  @xcite exploiting a coulomb gas of instantons in _ three _ dimensions , to _ four _ dimensions .",
    "( work in this direction is under active consideration . )",
    "the second physical relevance of this model is in the fact that it supports both instantons and sphalerons , in contrast for example to the standard electroweak model which supports only the latter , and whose instantons have shrinking size unless if constrained instantons  @xcite are employed .",
    "it is known that theories which support _ both _ finite size instantons _ and _ sphalerons on the one hand , and those which support _ only _ sphalerons on the other , have quite distinct properties concerning the contribution of periodic instantons  @xcite relative to that of the sphaleron and the instanton .",
    "this situation has been clearly demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the case of various ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional @xmath3 sigma models with the above described relative properties .    in section 2 , we present the model and explain how the generalised monopole  @xcite gives the sphaleron solution .",
    "this is done using a `` geometrical '' ncl ansatz  @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we construct the finite energy barrier as a ncl with the sphaleron at the top .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a discussion of our results in the context of some extensions of the model used here , which help to highlight the physical relevance of these results and point out the theoretical obstacles that must be tackled .",
    "we consider a model in @xmath4 spacetime dimensions , consisting of a @xmath0 gauge field and a higgs quartet field @xmath5 .",

    "the instanton solutions to this system were evaluated numerically in ref .",
    "their salient properties are that they are exponentially localised and , the connection is _ not _ asymptotically pure gauge , both in contrast to the bpst  @xcite instanton .",
    "the first of these properties results in the finite size of the instanton , fixed by the absolute scale @xmath14 .",
    "the second property results because the asymptotic gauge field decays as one half times a pure gauge , rather like a t  hooft  polyakov monopole  @xcite .",
    "a very important consequence is that the curvature field of this instanton features an inverse  square decay , leading to the possibility of constructing a coulomb gas of instantons  @xcite .",
    "the existence of finite size instantons ensures that the basic model ( [ m1 ] ) has topologically distinct vacua separated by energy barriers of finite height . to construct a path connecting two vacua `` over the barrier '' in the space of static configurations with finite energy @xmath15 @xcite where @xmath16 is the static hamiltonian @xmath17",
    "we follow a standard geometrical technique @xcite exploiting the topological properties of the model , resulting from the requirement of finite energy .",
    "the higgs field of any static finite energy configuration has to satisfy @xmath18 at spatial infinity @xmath19 , hence any finite energy configuration defines a mapping @xmath20 .",

    "the loop itself has to start ( @xmath32 ) and end ( @xmath33 ) in the vacuum which we choose to be @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "this allows the gauge field along the loop to be chosen proportional to the gauge field at infinity , introducing a radial profile function @xmath36 , whereas the higgs field has to be deformed to reach the vacua : @xmath37 with @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the profile functions @xmath39 and @xmath36 are subject to the boundary conditions @xmath40 resulting from the requirements of regularity at the origin and finite energy .",
    "the loop resulting from this construction is noncontractible as @xmath41 was chosen to be a topologically nontrivial mapping .",

    "nevertheless , besides the ( spherically symmetric ) vacua for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the loop ansatz reduces to a spherically symmetric ansatz for @xmath44 , @xmath45 for this value @xmath44 , the radial subsystem loop hamiltonian ( [ m12 ] ) reduces to the radial subsystem hamiltonian of the generalised @xmath2 higgs monopole system @xcite ( the coupling constants have to be adjusted to @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) for which solutions @xmath48 are known numerically .    due to spherical symmetry ,",
    "inserting these monopole profile functions into the ansatz ( [ m14 ] ) yields an extremum of the static energy functional ( [ m6 ] ) . since by construction",
    "this extremum appears along a path connecting two vacua , it is expected to be a saddle point .",

    "[ so4fig1 ] shows that for this loop , @xmath51 really reaches its maximum for @xmath44 which proves that the extremum we found is indeed an instable saddle point , hence the sphaleron of the basic model ( [ m1 ] ) .    , @xmath50 , @xmath52    it is a special feature of the geometrical ncl construction that the spherically symmetric loop configuration ( [ m14 ] ) involves only a higgs triplet ( @xmath53 ) and an @xmath54 gauge field .",

    "the construction of the geometrical loop in the previous section was guided by the topological properties of static finite energy configurations .",

    "this term is not a mass term in the sense that the accompanying quadratic kinetic term @xmath96 is absent .",

    "this brings us to the final item of discussion , namely the question of the absence of the ym term @xmath97 in ( [ m1 ] ) .",
    "independently of the dynamics of the @xmath0 system with the higgs field in the 4-vector representation , there exists a dirac gauge in which the higgs field can be gauged to a constant at infinity .",
    "it follows that the asymptotic @xmath6 gauge field must decay with the inverse power of @xmath98 , with an inverse  square decay of the curvature . in 4 dimensions , the contribution of the ym term @xmath97 in ( [ m1 ] ) to the action",
    "will then be logarithmically divergent .",
    "thus , the most important property of this model ( and its extended versions ) , namely its suitability for describing a coulomb gas of instantons , prevents the presence of the usual ym term with the consequence that the gauge field and its massive component are not endowed with a propagator .    to complete this argument one has to eliminate the following possibility : namely that instead of exploiting the descendent of the _ fourth _ chern  pontryagin charge ( [ l2 ] )",

    "second _ chern  pontryagin charge @xmath99 . in that case , the topological lower bound @xmath100 holds and as a result the curvature strength decays as the inverse power of @xmath101 , corresponding to an asymptotically pure gauge connection like the bpst  @xcite instanton .",
    "the problem here is that the finite action condition for the higgs terms in ( [ bound ] ) results in an asymptotic connection field that decays as _",
    "times a pure gauge , which is inconsistent with the finite action requirement on the ym terms , namely that the connection be asymptotically pure gauge .          see for example , d.h .",
