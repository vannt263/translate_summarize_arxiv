    "in the last decade , an enormous amount of research in the field of nanoelectronics was devoted to the study of electronic transport through quantum dots .",
    "a seminal and very versatile type of device is the gate - defined artificial atom created at the two - dimensional electron gas confined in semiconducting heterostructures.@xcite more recently , molecular quantum dots  @xcite have gained an important momentum , due to the possibility of playing with the chemistry of the molecule , which compensates the reduced gate tunability of these systems . in all these quantum dot setups , several physical effects are generically observed when the system is cooled at cryogenic temperatures : coulomb blockade is probably the major one , due to the large charging effects in these nanoscopic quantum dots .",
    "in addition , more subtle correlations show up due to the kondo effect  @xcite , which implies a resonance at the fermi energy in the spectral density of the dot state , which in turn leads to an anomalous peak in the differential conductance @xmath0 at zero bias voltage @xmath1 .",
    "however , important and unexpected correlation effects can also take place in transport features at finite bias voltage .",
    "for instance , coulomb blockade edges were shown by knemann _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to present a strong width renormalization in the situation of large tunnel asymmetries between source and drain electrodes , that is also quite typical in molecular quantum dots.@xcite enhancement of cotunneling features of excitation levels ( as precursor of the kondo effect ) were also described by paaske _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and later widely observed .",
    "all these features need to be incorporated in the current theoretical developments of non - equilibrium quantum transport , which has so far mainly focused in analyzing the main universal kondo signatures in @xmath2 under many simplifying assumptions ( such as symmetric capacitive and tunnel coupling to the electrodes ) . in particular , the experiment by knemann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated a strongly confined semiconducting quantum dot coupled to two conducting leads with highly asymmetric tunnel couplings , and studied tunneling resonances at nearly opposite values of @xmath1 . while in absence of interaction effects one expects nearly the same intensity and width of the two resonances ( see section  [ rele ] ) , the coulomb blockade edge at positive voltage was however nearly five times more intense and nearly two times narrower than the peak at negative voltage .",
    "the authors assumed that for negative voltage , the width in the spectral density of the dot level is two times larger than for positive voltage .",
    "this is based on the fact that the charge - transfer peak ( the one near the dot level @xmath3 ) in the density of states of the anderson model is two times wider when the dot is occupied.@xcite however , as we shall show , the peak for negative voltage corresponds to the intermediate valence ( iv ) regime , in which the width of the spectral density is approximately 3/2 times larger than in the empty - orbital regime .",
    "in addition , the ratio of widths for negative and positive voltages depends also on the asymmetries of the source and drain capacitances . our calculation will also be able to take into account the presence of a kondo resonance at small bias , which in previous coulomb blockade theory was clearly lacking.@xcite    in this paper , after a brief discussion of what is expected in the absence of coulomb interactions for asymmetric coupling to the leads , we calculate the differential conductance @xmath4 in the keldysh formalism within the non - crossing approximation ( nca).@xcite the nca reproduces well the scaling relations with temperature @xmath5 and bias voltage in the kondo regime @xcite and was for example also successfully used to interpret experimental results on a controlled crossover between su(4 ) and su(2 ) kondo states driven by magnetic field in a nanoscale si transistor @xcite , as well as quantum phase transitions involving singlet and triplet states in molecular quantum dots.@xcite it was also used recently to discuss non - equilibrium kondo spectroscopy in a system of double quantum dots.@xcite for asymmetric coupling to the leads , we will also derive an analytical expression which describes semiquantitatively the nca results .",
    "this expression is used to interpret the experiments of knemann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite providing a good agreement , and could be used for further studies of molecular systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we present the hamiltonian and the equation describing the current in presence of a finite bias . in section [ rele ]",
    "we compute for comparison the differential conductance @xmath2 in absence of coulomb interaction .",
    "section [ ncares ] contains the nca results for the non - linear conductance , and presents an analysis of the positions and widths of the peaks displayed in @xmath2 for different experimentally relevant conditions . in section [ compa ]",
    "we discuss the experiment of knemann _ et al .",
    "_ , and end up in section [ sum ] with a summary .",
    "we consider the anderson impurity model with infinite on - site repulsion @xmath6 , an assumption that is realistic for most molecular quantum dots , but also well obeyed for very small semiconducting devices in the vicinity of a charge - degeneracy point .",
    "the impurity states thus involve a singlet configuration @xmath7 together with a spin doublet @xmath8 ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) corresponding to one additional electron ( or hole ) in the dot , taking this particle from the left ( @xmath11 ) or right ( @xmath12 ) conducting leads to which the dot is connected .",
    "the hamiltonian thus reads : @xmath13where the constraint @xmath14 create conduction states in the lead @xmath15 with spin @xmath16 and wave vector @xmath17 .",
    "the tunnel couplings of the quantum dot to the leads are @xmath18 , assumed independent of energy @xmath19 , and we define the total hybridization @xmath20 .",
    "we take the sign of the bias voltage in such a way that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the chemical potential of lead @xmath15 .",
    "note that the interchange of right and left leads or electrons by holes is equivalent to a change of sign of @xmath1 .",
    "we take the arbitrary origin of energies at @xmath23 .",
    "the capacitance effects modify the energy necessary to add an electron to the dot with the lever arm parameter @xmath24 ( which depends on the source , drain and gate capacitances )  @xcite , defined as : @xmath25where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the electron charge ( taken positive ) .",
    "for the situation of symmetric voltage drop that is usually considered , @xmath28 is often taken near 1/2 , but this may not be the case in many experimental setups .",
    "we obtain the conductance @xmath29 differentiating the current @xmath30 ( numerically from nca results ) , which is given by @xcite @xmath31 , \\notag \\\\ c & = & \\frac{8\\pi e\\delta _ { l}\\delta _ { r}}{h\\delta } , \\label{i}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath32 is the fermi distribution in each lead , with @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the non - equilibrium ( voltage - dependent ) spectral density of the impurity level .",
    "before discussing in more detail the complex effects of coulomb interactions , we present in this section a simplified model that sheds light onto the expected behavior of the differential conductance @xmath2 .",
    "the first assumption that we make in this section is that the tunnel couplings to the leads are very asymmetric .",
    "this hypothesis is realistic for molecular quantum dots and also in the experiment of knemann _ et al . _ in ref .  .",
    "we make here the choice @xmath35 , so that the system is in equilibrium with the right lead and the explicit dependence on the voltage of the spectral density @xmath36 disappears [ the dependence of @xmath37 with @xmath1 through @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ ed ] ) remains ] .",
    "then one has @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spectral density of the impurity states in equilibrium with the right lead , for a dot energy given by eq .",
    "( [ ed ] ) . using equations ( [ ed]-[rhoap ] ) , one obtains at @xmath41 @xmath42 in the limit of asymmetric capacitances @xmath43 , only the first term survives and @xmath2 is just a map of the spectral density @xmath44 , as is usual with experiments with a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "therefore , in this limit , @xmath2 has a single peak located at @xmath45 ( the charge - transfer peak ) , and no peak for the opposite bias voltage .",
    "in addition , a kondo peak at @xmath46 can show up in presence of coulomb interactions , if @xmath47 .",
    "the main assumption that we make in this section is to take a non - interacting resonant level spectral density of width @xmath48 at half maximum , @xmath49 with @xmath50 this is a crude approximation which is certainly not valid in presence of interactions ( it misses the important kondo anomaly ) , but it can describe qualitatively the position and width of the coulomb peaks in @xmath2 derived from the charge - transfer peak in the spectral density of the dot states , which can be renormalized from bare values by the interaction , as we discuss in section [ phen ] . assuming , as in eq .",

    "( [ ed ] ) . while the assumption made above for the derivatives of the current is not exactly true ( even in equilibrium ) because of the dependence of the weight and width of the peaks with @xmath38 , this simple expression reflects a general feature of the expected coulomb peaks , in connection to the charge - transfer peak of the equilibrium spectral density @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , now @xmath2 displays two finite bias peaks , one that is similar to the stm case and is located at voltage @xmath55 [ namely @xmath56 , and a second `` intermediate valence '' ( iv ) peak at an opposite voltage value such that @xmath57 . in this latter case , the impurity experiences indeed maximal charge fluctuations because the level is located exactly on - resonance , and thus one can expect a different width renormalization than for the stm peak , due to the different influence of the coulomb interaction , as we will demonstrate later on . for positive @xmath58 ( corresponding to a vanishing charge in the dot , also called the empty orbital regime ) , the stm peak lies at positive bias and the iv peak is located at negative bias , and conversely for negative @xmath58 ( corresponding to a spin - degenerate odd charge in the dot , also called the local moment regime ) . thus ,",

    "the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) has proved in the past an excellent technique to deal with large coulomb interactions , and can be extended to the present non - equilibrium situation . in order to gain intuition , we first focus on the zero - bias ( @xmath46 ) spectral density of the localized level , which is shown on fig .",

    "the total intensity is also reduced by correlation effects , as discussed phenomenologically in section [ phen ] , and the position of the peak is also shifted to higher energies .",
    "more importantly , the screening of the spin - degenerate states leads to a kondo peak at the fermi level , a non - trivial effect that the nca is able to describe properly .",

    "these trends are well described by the full nca calculation shown in fig .",

    "this will be disussed in more detail in the next subsection .",
    "the width of the iv peak within the nca is about 20% larger than @xmath87 .",
    "this can be due to the above mentioned effects or to the limitations of the nca at low temperatures in the iv regime . in any case",

    "as @xmath24 decreases , the tendencies predicted by the simple analysis of section [ rele ] remain qualitatively valid .",
    "the position of the stm peak tends to @xmath58 and its width to @xmath48 in the limit @xmath100 .",

    "the iv peak , now located at positive bias voltage , displays again a width that is about 3/2 wider than the simple expectations outlined at the end of section [ rele ] , due to combined charge fluctuations and coulomb effects ( the width is @xmath87 for @xmath83 ) .",
    "the iv peak is also shifted to the left , since for @xmath83 one would expect it to lie at @xmath101 , while it is located at @xmath102 .",
    "while naively one would expect a ratio of maxima inversely proportional to the width , the intensity of the stm peak is smaller than expected , especially for @xmath83 .",
    "this further correlation effect is discussed in the next subsection where we present a more refined analytical approach .",
    "again , as @xmath24 decreases , the width and intensity of both peaks evolve in agreement with the expectations of the non - interacting resonant - level model .",
    "as expected , the most drastic difference with the non - interacting resonant - level model for negative @xmath58 is the appearance of the kondo peak at @xmath46 .",
    "note that its main features are independent of @xmath24 , which will be discussed in section [ wk ] .",
    "we now turn to a physical interpretation of the numerical nca result .",
    "the main reason for the failure of the non - interacting resonant - level model to account for coulomb blockade peaks at asymmetric tunnel coupling to the leads is that the correct width and weight of the peak in the impurity level spectral density @xmath37 both depend in a non - trivial way on the occupancy , as discussed in section [ dens ] .",
    "one of the simplest ways to modelize this effect is the alloy analogy approach to periodic anderson models , in which the electrons with spin down are frozen to calculate the dynamics of electrons with spin up and vice versa.@xcite this approach is also related to the so - called hubbard - iii approximation,@xcite in which the weight of the charge - transfer peak near @xmath38 for spin @xmath103 ( or the lower hubbard band in a hubbard model ) is proportional to the number of unoccupied states with the opposite spin , @xmath104 .    to correct the width inconsistency in the non - interacting resonant level model ,",
    "we have fitted the width of the nca peak as a function of @xmath38 at a temperature @xmath105 ( such that the kondo peak is absent and the width of the iv peak is well behaved @xcite ) , with other parameters taken as in section [ asym ] . for simplicity , in this section and in section [ compa ] , we replace the notation @xmath106 by @xmath38 , incorporating the haldane shift in the latter . from this",

    "full ( dotted ) line corresponds to negative ( positive ) bias voltage . ]    in the experiment , there is a peak at @xmath158 - 9.7 mv with a half width of 76 @xmath151v and another one at @xmath1588.9 mv with a half width of 35.5 @xmath151v which is about five times more intense . for @xmath159 ( as suggested in ref .  ) , the non - interacting resonant level model incorrectly predicts two peaks of equal width and height at opposite voltages ( see the end of section [ rele ] ) . for @xmath83 ,",
    "our more accurate phenomelogical theory predicts a ratio of about 3/2 between the width of the iv peak at negative @xmath1 and the stm peak at positive @xmath1 , and not a ratio of about two .",
    "however , the fact that the positions of the two peaks are not symmetric with respect to zero bias shows that @xmath24 is in fact different from 1/2 . using @xmath133 to adjust the correct peak position , this provides an additional contribution to the ratio in the peak widths . in fig .",
    "[ hau ] we display our results for parameters close to the experiment .",
    "while we are unable to reproduce exactly the intensities , positions and widths of both peaks , we obtain a semiquantitative agreement with experiment .",
    "our conductance curves can be fitted with the sum of two lorentzians : one located at @xmath160 mv with half - width at half - maximum 64 @xmath151v and peak value @xmath161 , another one located at @xmath162 mv , with half - width at half - maximum 36 @xmath151v and peak value @xmath163 . in the future ,",
    "comparisons to further experimental data for molecular quantum dots deep in the kondo regime would be interesting , in order to test our predictions .",
    "motivated by experiments with semiconducting and molecular quantum dots  @xcite , we have analyzed the complete shape of the differential conductance @xmath2 in the infinite-@xmath6 anderson model connected to two leads , as a function of the ratio of the potential drops between the dot and both leads , and for various tunneling asymmetries .",
    "the simplest situation is the one found in scanning tunneling spectroscopies , where both the potential drop and tunneling rates are strongly asymmetric towards the metallic surface on which a molecule is deposited .",
    "as is well - known in this situation , the conductance provides exactly a measure of the equilibrium spectral density of the quantum dot and displays only one coulomb peak when voltage is aligned to the charge - transfer peak in the spectral density ( this peak position may contain renormalization effects ) . when the impurity level is deeply negative , a local moment forms , and the kondo effect leads to an additional anomaly near zero bias , both in the density of states and differential conductance .",
    "the situation of an arbitrary ratio for the capacitance to the source and drain is more complex ( even still assuming very asymmetric tunneling rates ) .",
    "we find that the coulomb peak position and width in this regime not only display trivial changes expected from the modification of the capacitance ratio , but are also corrected by many - body effects .",
    "as it is known from previous calculations,@xcite , and reproduced by our nca results , the width of the charge - transfer peak is about two times larger for large and negative level position ( local moment regime ) than for large and positive position ( empty orbital regime ) .",
    "in addition , an extra coulomb peak appears at opposite voltage values to the peak found in the stm situation , as expected from coulomb blockade theory .",
    "however , this peak has in general a different nature , and relates to the intermediate valence situation of the underlying quantum impurity model , and displays accordingly a width renormalization of about 3/2 compared to expectations based on a non - interacting effective resonant level model .",
    "all these effects can be taken into account by a simple phenomenological approach described in section [ phen ] , which is able to describe well our numerical simulations ( except for the presence of the kondo resonance ) and agrees semiquantitatively with some published experimental results [ see section [ compa ] ] .",
    "we also provided some general study of the kondo temperature extracted from the differential conductance ( as typically done in experiments ) , and made some precise connection to the kondo scale extracted theoretically from the equilibrium spectral density .",
    "we find that the former scale can be up to 60% larger than the latter one , and that they coincide only for asymmetric tunnel couplings deeply in the kondo regime .",
    "we hope that all these results will serve as guidelines for interpreting more quantitatively experimental data obtained from molecular quantum dots , since many - body effects can quantitatively alter the predictions of basic coulomb blockade theory .",
