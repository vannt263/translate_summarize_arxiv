    "one of the most interesting features of the spacetime of a straight cosmic string @xcite in general relativity is its conical structure @xcite . if the string is investigated within the einstein ",
    "cartan theory ( ec theory ) of gravity @xcite , then the geometry of the string spacetime may additionally have a chiral structure @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the string represents a topological defect of spacetime that may be described in geometrical terms by delta function - valued torsion and curvature components",
    ".    it has been noticed by several authors that the spacetime geometries of cosmic strings in @xmath6 dimensions @xcite exhibit some close relations to so - called _ distortions _ of solids , which may likewise be regarded as topological defect lines carrying torsion and curvature .",
    "similar analogies hold in @xmath7 dimensional gravity @xcite , where the spacetime geometry of a point particle can be understood in terms of distortions .",
    "this point has recently been studied in detail by kohler @xcite .",
    "distortions were introduced by volterra @xcite in the context of the theory of elasticity and have later been subject to innumerable investigations in the context of both solid continua and crystals , see , for instance , nabarro @xcite , klman @xcite , krner @xcite , and references therein .",
    "it is remarkable that already nabarro mentioned the possible existence of timelike distortions @xcite and the resemblance of marder s cylindrically symmetric solution @xcite of the einstein equation to distortions .    in this article",
    ", we intend to investigate in a systematic way the above - mentioned analogy between distortions of solids and defect structures of riemann  cartan manifolds .",
    "this is done by means of a reexamination of the classical volterra process , see below , which results naturally in the construction of what we call _ distortions of spacetime_. the straight cosmic string is the most prominent example of such a geometry .    in the ec theory of gravity , we have two kinds of sources : energy - momentum , which generates curvature just as in ordinary einsteinian gravity , and spin - angular momentum , generating torsion .",
    "if we want to construct some matter distribution which has as its exterior spacetime the defect spacetime under consideration , we can think of to two inequivalent strategies .",
    "taking the cosmic string as a prototype , it may , on the one hand , be considered as a _",
    "thin string _ of zero width ; on the other hand , the interior spacetime can be modeled as a _ thick string _ ,",
    "i.e. as a cylinder with finite radius .",
    "there are two reasons for adopting the latter approach in the present investigation .",
    "first of all , gauge theories that allow for string formation during spontaneous symmetry breaking predict extremely thin , but finite strings , whose radii depend on the energy scale of symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "secondly , it has been shown by geroch and traschen @xcite that  due to the nonlinearity of the field equations  it is mathematically ambiguous to define matter currents corresponding to thin strings ( see , however , the recent work by clarke et al .",
    "@xcite for a possibility to deal with two - dimensional distributional sources by means of colombeau s new generalized functions ) .",
    "interior solutions with finite radius have already been found for massive strings in general relativity @xcite and spin - polarized strings in ec theory @xcite . here",
    ", we use this construction to find interior solutions that can be matched to more general defect spacetimes .",
    "we have organized this article as follows : in section  [ sect : distortions ] we generalize the volterra process to @xmath6 dimensions using differential geometric and gauge theoretic methods and study explicit examples of volterra distorted spacetimes . in detail",
    "we discuss only those distortions that are matched to the corresponding interior matter - filled solution in section [ sect : extended ] . here",
    "we construct interior solutions of the einstein ",
    "cartan field equations , which are matched to the volterra defect spacetimes , and the resulting matter distributions are interpreted as cosmic strings and cosmic dislocations .    for the sake of notational compactness",
    ", we use at the same time cartesian coordinates @xmath8 and cylindrical coordinates @xmath9 . for tensors and tensor - valued forms",
    "we sometimes suppress indices and use a self - evident matrix notation ( indicated by boldface types ) instead .",

    "the ( hodge ) star operator will be denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "we use geometrized units with @xmath28 .",
    "a gravitational theory encompassing the equivalence principle is most conveniently described in terms of the geometry of spacetime . in this framework gravity is synonymous with some sort of deformation of spacetime .",
    "mass and spin are `` gravitational currents '' , which in turn are intimately connected with the poincar group . from a gauge - theoretic perspective",
    "one would a priori expect this group to be the local gauge group of gravity .",
    "taking the elasticity picture seriously , it is of interest to systematically study simple elastic deformations of spacetime and the corresponding global geometries and local sources . to this end",
    "we generalize the volterra process to four - dimensional spacetime .      to    ( 1,.28 ) ( .01,.0 ) ( a ) ( .38,.0 ) ( b ) ( .73,.0 ) ( c ) ( 0.575,0.017)(-2,-1).06 ( 0.9,0.09)(-3 , 2).047    in the year 1907 vito volterra published an extensive article dedicated to the study of elastic deformations of multiply - connected , solid , three - dimensional objects @xcite .",
    "his leitmotif was to take  as a prototype of such an object  a hollow cylinder made out of elastic material and cut it at a half two - plane , e.g.  at @xmath29 ( using cylindrical coordinates @xmath30 , the cylinder is taken to be oriented along the @xmath31-axis ) , thereby destroying its multiple connectedness .",
    "then take the two lips that have been separated by the cut and translate and rotate them against each other .",
    "finally , after eventually removing superfluous or adding missing material , weld the two planes together again , see fig .",
    "[ fig : volterraprocess ] .",
    "this cutting and welding process is called the _ volterra process . _    the volterra process , by construction , yields six different kinds of objects , see fig .  [",
    "fig : distortions ] , which belong to the six degrees of freedom of the proper group of motion in @xmath32 , the euclidean group @xmath0 .",
    "volterra called the resulting configurations _ distortions of order one to six_. the distortions belonging to the translational subgroup @xmath33 and the rotational subgroup @xmath34 are called _ dislocations _ and _ disclinations , _ respectively .    to = 0.24 = 0.27 = 0.23 to = 0.24 = 0.27 = 0.24    ( 1,.7 ) ( .01,+.0 ) ( d ) ( .38,+.0 ) ( e ) ( .73,+.0 ) ( f ) ( .01,0.23)(a ) ( .38,0.23)(b ) ( .73,0.23)(c )    when lifting the volterra process from @xmath35 to @xmath36 dimensions , it is clear that instead of creating distorted hollow cylinders out of undistorted ones , the basic notion must be to ` distort ' minkowski spacetime into different riemann  cartan geometries .",
    "the group that takes the place of @xmath0 is evidently the poincar group @xmath37 with its 6 rotational and 4 translational parameters corresponding to the proper orthochronous lorentz subgroup @xmath38 and the translational subgroup @xmath39 , respectively . adopting the language of the theory of elasticity",
    ", we may say that minkowski spacetime will be deformed by 6 disclinations and 4 dislocations into 10 differently structured riemann ",
    "cartan spacetimes .",
    "it will turn out that these are locally flat and uncontorted , but contain  as expected  topological defects represented by singular lines .",
    "to arrive at an accurate description of the volterra process , we must take a closer look at the cut that precedes the deformation .",
    "in an @xmath40-dimensional manifold , this cut is constructed in such a way that it separates two half @xmath41-dimensional hyperspaces , the _ lips _ of the cut , ending at an @xmath42-dimensional hyperspace , which will be denoted as the _ defect region_. this name is justified because the defect region has to be excluded from the spacetime manifold , in analogy to the interior region of volterra s hollow cylinder .",
    "the two - plane perpendicular to the defect will be called the _ supporting plane _ of the distortion",
    ". it will carry translational and rotational holonomy . in a @xmath43-dimensional spacetime ,",
    "there are two situations , which are distinct in principle : the intrinsic metric of the supporting plane may carry riemannian ( spacelike ) or lorentzian signature . in the first case",
    ", the respective distortions are said to be _ space - supported _ , in the latter case they are called _",
    "space-  and time - supported_. of course , the space-   and time - supported distortions have no analogy in the theory of elasticity .      in the theory of elasticity , the conventional approach to describe the mechanics of an elastic deformation is to displace the point  of some unstressed body by an amount @xmath44 .",
    "thus the point with coordinates @xmath45 of the deformed body is related to the initial state by @xmath46 and @xmath44 is called the _ displacement field _ of the deformation . with the volterra process in mind",
    ", the deformation can be described more generally by saying that the euclidean group @xmath0 acts _ locally _ on the undeformed state , i.e.   @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "conventionally , the theory of elasticity is formulated by means of differential geometric tools @xcite .",
    "the suggestive form of ( [ eq : localeuclid ] )  points to a more recent approach , namely a @xmath50 gauge theory of solid continua containing defects @xcite , which will allow the generalizations envisioned very intuitively ( a corresponding task in the context of @xmath7 dimensional gravity is investigated in the work by kohler @xcite ) : we can , in a natural way , adapt the results from elasticity to a theory of gravity by taking the poincar group @xmath51 as a gauge group acting locally on minkowski spacetime @xmath52 .",
    "in essence , we are developing an _ active _ poincar gauge theory .",
    "the reason why we select the poincar group is its prominent rle as a spacetime symmetry group in special relativity .",
    "moreover , both mass and spin , the corresponding matter currents , are known to exist in nature .",
    "consequently , our starting point is an @xmath52 with global coordinate cover @xmath53 . in analogy to ( [ eq : localeuclid ] )",
    ", we express the local action of the poincar group @xmath51 by the operation @xmath54 with a local lorentz boost @xmath55 and a local translation @xmath56 .",
    "the gauge construction will become most transparent if we introduce the following mbius type matrix representation @xcite : in the five - dimensional hyperplane @xmath57 , the group action ( [ eq : x ] ) can be written @xmath58 here and in the rest of the article it is understood that operations always act locally , i.e.  @xmath59 , and so on .",
    "now the standard gauge approach  la yang  mills can be applied @xcite .",
    "we define the connection @xmath60 that transforms inhomogeneously into @xmath61 under @xmath51 .",
    "explicitly , we find the @xmath38-algebra - valued connection one - form , the _ lorentz connection _ , @xmath62 compensating for the local action of the lorentz sector , and the @xmath63-valued connection one - form , the _ translation connection _ , @xmath64 compensating for the local action of @xmath39 . here",
    "we have used the notation @xmath65 .",
    "the transformation behaviour ( [ eq : phi ] ) of the translation part @xmath66 of the connection is inhomogeneous and hence , in particular , nontensorial .",
    "for this reason , @xmath66 can not be taken as coframe of the target space .",
    "there is , however , a trick to circumvent this situation @xcite : the _ soldering one - form _",
    "@xmath67 with some vector - valued zero - form @xmath68 , shows the ` right ' transformation behaviour , namely that of a vector - valued one - form .",
    "the rle of @xmath68 , sometimes called the _ poincar coordinate _ @xcite , or _ generalized higgs field _",
    "@xcite , is not completely clear , see @xcite and the literature given there .",
    "in contrast to the authors of @xcite , who choose @xmath69 , we impose the condition @xmath70 , and find @xmath71 which can be regarded as the exterior covariant derivative @xmath72 acting on @xmath73 : @xmath74 the soldering forms ( [ eq : coframe ] ) make up an orthonormal coframe , which yields @xmath75 with @xmath18 .",
    "finally , the torsion two - form  is defined by the structure equation @xmath76 where  denotes the curvature two - form defined by the structure equation @xmath77      we have already pointed to the fact that the distorted spacetime manifolds will be _ locally _ flat and uncontorted . in order to detect the effect of the generalized volterra process",
    ", we compute the holonomy transformation , usually considered in the loop space formulation of gauge theories @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite in the context of cosmic strings . )    for our purpose , it is sufficient to think of a vierbein , transported along a closed path @xmath78 around the line - like defect region .",
    "more precisely , @xmath78 is the image in @xmath79 of a closed path to be the _ development _",
    "@xcite in @xmath52 of a curve which is closed in @xmath79 . ] in the undistorted @xmath52 under the mapping ( [ eq : x ] ) . as a result of this parallel transport",
    ", we will detect translational holonomy , characterized by the _ burgers vector _ @xmath80 , and rotational holonomy , described by @xmath81 , the _ frank matrix _",
    ".. however , to be consistent we would have to use something like `` translational parallel transporter '' for the burgers vector .",
    "therefore , we have adapted the name frank matrix , which is the four - dimensional analogue of the frank vector of a solid - state disclination . ] in other words , after parallel transport along @xmath78 , the vierbein will have been subject to an affine transformation  the above - mentioned holonomy transformation  namely a translation and a `` rotation '' @xmath82 .",
    "the burgers vector is defined to be the contour integral of the coframe @xcite @xmath83 the contour integral of the minkowski coframe @xmath84 vanishes .",
    "thus , if we restrict ourselves to dislocations , characterized by @xmath85 and consequently @xmath86 , we find from ( [ eq : coframe ] ) for the burgers vector @xmath87 in order to compute the frank matrix @xmath82 of the distorted spacetime , we start from the lorentz connection @xmath88 as defined in ( [ eq : connection ] ) .",

    "explicitly we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the path - ordered exponential , which reflects the noncommutative structure of the lorentz group @xmath38 .",
    "full information on the rotational holonomy is only contained in the frank matrix .",
    "the deficit angle @xmath91 , frequently used to describe disclinations in solids , is the fixed parameter value of @xmath82 , but , of course , we lose information on the two - plane in which @xmath82 acts if we only give the deficit angle @xmath91 .",

    "likewise , the two components of the spin are given by similar integrals with spin densities replacing the energy density :    @xmath190    note that these two equations can be expressed more compactly by means of the surface values of the metric coefficients @xmath184 and @xmath183 .",

    "these relations make up the boundary conditions for the exterior gravitational field that we will construct in the next section .",
    "with the field equations solved , the curvature two - form is left with the only nonvanishing components @xmath193 which is the finite version of expression ( [ eq : curvorder6 ] ) for the wedge disclination ( order six ) .",
    "we shall now use the akp conditions as formulated in sect .",
    "[ sec : matching ] and find the exterior solution corresponding to the above spin - polarized cylinder . by construction , the vacuum solution will comprise the two screw dislocations ( orders zero and three ) and the wedge disclination ( order six ) .",

    "the spacetime with the ( locally ) flat metric ( [ eq : exteriormetric ] ) has also been investigated recently by tod @xcite and by galtsov and letelier @xcite . by straightforward computation",
    "we find that ( [ eq : akpcond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : akpcond2 ] ) are satisfied for the present matter currents ( [ eq : energymomentum ] ) and ( [ eq : spin ] ) . the junction conditions ( [ eq : akpbound1 ] ) and ( [ eq : akpbound2 ] ) read @xmath198 written out explicitly , we have the following system of algebraic equations for determining @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 : @xmath203\\;,\\\\     0 & = & c'(r)-\\beta \\rho(r)\\;,\\\\     0 & = & -m'(r)+\\sigma \\rho(r)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] combining the above conditions with ( [ eq : solutionrho ] )  and ( )   we get @xmath204 where we have evaluated the integrals ( [ eq : j0 ] ) and ( [ eq : j3 ] ) with ( [ sigbeta ] ) inserted .",
    "the solution falls into three classes depending on the nature of the vector @xmath192 .",
    "if it is timelike , the solution corresponds to the spinning string @xcite .",
    "if it is null , the metric can be regarded as the limiting case of a cosmic string interacting with a gravitational wave , and if it is spacelike , the solution is a so - called cosmic dislocation @xcite .",
    "the mass and spin parameters of the source can be related to dislocations and disclinations as described in section  [ sect : distortions ] .",
    "hence , the mass per length @xmath205 produces an axial disclination ( distortion of order six ) with disclination strength @xmath206 , see table [ tab : disclin ] ; the zeroth component of the spin vector @xmath207 induces a time - dislocation ( order zero ) and @xmath208 results in an axial dislocation ( order three ) ; the corresponding exterior metrics are those given in table [ tab : disloc ] .",
    "the exterior metric ( [ eq : exteriormetric ] )  can thus be produced by a combination of these spacetime distortions .",
    "the deficit angle @xmath91 outside the string is determined by @xmath209 .",
    "note that in the conical case there is a maximal radius of the cylinder given by @xmath210 this maximal radius corresponds to a string with deficit angle and mass per length equal to @xmath211 . in this case , @xmath212 diverges , and in the first term of @xmath213 in the exterior metric , only the combination @xmath214 survives , making @xmath213 constant here .",
    "thus , for @xmath215 , spacetime becomes cylindrical rather than conical .",
    "a poincar gauge theory is a natural four - dimensional generalization of the @xmath0 gauge theory of solid continua with line defects . from this perspective",
    "we have found spacetime equivalents of the volterra distortions of elastic media . for a subset of these spacetime distortions",
    "we have found the corresponding nonsingular sources in the einstein  cartan theory of gravity .",
    "if we recall the interpretation of the interior solution in terms of the convective spin fluid under consideration  see sect .",
    "[ sec : fieldeqs ] and the remarks at the end of sect .",
    "[ s : interior]we find that the geometry of the combined interior and exterior spacetime can be formulated with respect to two complementary sets of parameters . starting with the interior spacetime ,",
    "the relevant set is @xmath216 ; we call this the _ physical _ set . if , on the other hand , we start with the vacuum geometry , we should use the distortion strengths @xmath217 ; this is the _",
    "geometrical _ set of parameters .",
    "while expressions ( [ sol1])([sol3 ] ) represent the geometrical set in terms of the physical set , the complementary relations are @xmath218 correspondingly , all relevant geometrical quantities can be formulated with respect to either @xmath219 or @xmath217 . in particular ,",
    "the time dislocation and the axial dislocation are no longer independent of each other : by ( [ isol3 ] ) , the corresponding dislocation strengths are subject to the relation @xmath220 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath196 is fixed to some finite value , then @xmath221 would imply @xmath222 , which is clearly forbidden on physical grounds , since the fluid velocity must not exceed the speed of light .",
    "thereby we conclude that the axial dislocation can not occur alone , it is always accompanied by a time dislocation . moreover , by the same token , the ` cosmic dislocation ' @xcite , is unphysical in the sense that it corresponds to a spacelike four - velocity of the spin fluid .",
    "whether interior solutions can be found for the remaining ( space- or space- and time - supported ) distorted vacua remains an open question and deserves further investigation .",
    "the present strategy for constructing string sources is , at least in principle , applicable to these geometries , too : ( i ) take the _",
    "coframe _ and replace the constant distortion strength by a _ function _ , ( ii ) find the nonvanishing components of the _ torsion _ two - form and make a corresponding ansatz for the interior spacetime , and ( iii ) solve the field equations . _",
    "if _ a solution is found , then , by construction , it is expected to reproduce the respective distorted vacuum .",
    "it turns out , however , that in the generic case we have to face two problems that did nt appear in the cases solved .",
    "first of all , most of the remaining distorted vacua are either not cylindrically symmetric or nonstatic , compare tables [ tab : disloc ] and [ tab : disclin ] .",
    "secondly , the structure of the _ second _ field equation , with the the present spin fluid model , only allows for a quite restricted torsion part  as demonstrated in the appendix for one of the space- and time - supported defects  of the interior geometry .",
    "while the first mentioned problem merely is of technical nature , the circumvention of the second one requires substantial changes of the physical models used .",
    "one possible modification could be to consider a different spin - fluid matter model , such as that developed by ray and smalley @xcite , which was recently used by krisch @xcite to find a family of spinning string - type solutions in a spacetime with curvature and torsion .",
