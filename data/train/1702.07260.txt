    "the discovered higgs state at the lhc has properties of an isospin doublet field .",
    "although many new physics scenarios can be embedded in such a structure , one of the simplest but important examples is a 2hdm which naturally includes a neutral higgs state that can play the role of the discovered one .",
    "2hdms are furthermore well motivated theoretically  @xcite and generally compliant with past and present collider and other experimental data while still offering a wealth of new higgs states .    however , 2hdms with elementary higgses ( which we called e2hdms ) suffer , like the sm itself , from the so - called hierarchy problem . an elegant way to solve it is to presume that the discovered higgs boson and its possible 2hdm companions are not elementary but rather composite particles to which a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) nature is assigned .",
    "c2hdms embedding pngbs arising from a new strong dynamics at the tev scale can be constructed by explicitly imposing a specific symmetry breaking structure . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we will analyse c2hdms based on the spontaneous global symmetry breaking at a scale @xmath9 , typically in the tev region , of an @xmath18 symmetry . in these c2hdm scenarios",
    "there are five physical higgs states just like in e2hdms , i.e. , two cp - even ( @xmath0 and @xmath19 ) , one cp - odd ( @xmath20 ) and one pair of charged ( @xmath21 ) higgs bosons .",
    "as intimated , we identify the ( by definition ) lightest @xmath0 state as the discovered higgs boson with a mass of 125 gev . within this construct",
    ", one can derive deviations of c2hdm couplings from those of a generic renormalisable e2hdm as well as pursue searches for new non - sm - like ( composite ) higgs signals different from the elementary case .",
    "we already considered this aspect at the lhc in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , we study differences in single- and double-@xmath0 production cross sections at future @xmath22 colliders between e2hdms and c2hdms , where the latter are based on the model construction given in refs .",
    "@xcite . for single-@xmath0 production ,",
    "there are three relevant modes : ( i ) higgs - strahlung ( hs ) off a @xmath23 boson via @xmath24 , ( ii ) vector boson fusion ( vbf ) via @xmath25 induced vbf as the @xmath26 coupling scales in all scenarios considered in the same way as @xmath27 . ] and ( iii ) associated production with top quarks via @xmath28 .",
    "the double-@xmath0 production can be classified similarly by adding one more higgs boson @xmath0 to the final state , namely , we have : ( i ) @xmath29 , ( ii ) @xmath30 and ( iii ) @xmath31 .",
    "the single-@xmath0 production modes are useful to extract the @xmath27 coupling via ( i ) and ( ii ) plus the @xmath32 coupling via ( iii ) . because of the small background cross sections typical of a future @xmath1 machine as compared to those at the lhc , one expects to measure these higgs boson couplings with a good accuracy .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the 1@xmath33 error on the measurement of the @xmath27 and @xmath32 couplings at the international linear collider ( ilc ) are expected to be 0.5% and 2.5% , respectively , for an energy of @xmath34 gev and integrated luminosity of @xmath35 500 fb@xmath3 .",
    "notice that , in the @xmath36 mode , one can also have access to the @xmath37 coupling .",
    "the double-@xmath0 production modes are naturally sensitive not only to the @xmath27 and @xmath32 couplings but also to the triple higgs boson coupling @xmath38 . in particular",
    ", the measurement of @xmath38 is quite important to reconstruct the shape of the higgs potential , which has been known to be a very challenging task at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the expected precision achievable at future @xmath1 colliders in the measurement of @xmath38 is of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted with the much more limited accuracy expected at the lhc , wherein @xmath38 can be constrained only within a factor of 3 or so @xcite of the sm value .",
    "furthermore , the heavier cp - even higgs boson @xmath19 can contribute to the double - higgs boson production process through its propagators , thereby enabling sensitivity to the @xmath40 vertex , which is expected to be within a factor of 10 or so @xcite in e2hdms .",
    "in addition , the @xmath41 coupling becomes accessible alongside the @xmath42 one in associated production with top quarks .",
    "finally , quartic couplings of the type @xmath43 intervene too .",
    "( notice that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are related to the underlying gauge structure and as such are not independent couplings . ) therefore , the measurement of the aforementioned double - higgs boson cross sections at future @xmath1 colliders is important to also extract information about additional higgs bosons such as their masses and couplings .",
    "we will show in this paper that there exist measurable deviations induced in c2hdms by the dependence upon the compositeness scale in several higgs couplings which can not be explained in e2hdms , no matter the choice of parameters in either scenarios . in particular , assuming a fixed value of @xmath44 ( defined by the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) coupling normalised to the sm value ) , the difference between predictions in the two scenarios can be even larger than 50% for the double - higgs production processes .",
    "hence , a future electron - positron machine has the potential to discriminate between e2hdms and c2hdms .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the essential features of c2hdms that will be dealt with here , concentrating on the couplings entering the aforementioned production processes . in sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv , we tackle the @xmath1 phenomenology of single-@xmath0 and double-@xmath0 production modes , respectively . finally , we conclude in sec .  v.",
    "we give a brief review of our c2hdms .",
    "the important parameter which characterises the composite nature of higgs states is @xmath45 , defined by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) related to the fermi constant via @xmath48 gev .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath49 limit ( or equivalently the @xmath50 limit ) all predictions in c2hdms become the same as those in e2hdms . in c2hdms , @xmath47 is given by the vev @xmath51 as @xmath52 the ratio of the two vevs is expressed by @xmath53 .",
    "the pngb higgses are described by a non - linear @xmath33-model associated to the coset @xmath54 .",
    "their effective low - energy lagrangian ought to be constructed according to the callan , coleman , wess and zumino prescription , following which the scalar potential in c2hdms is generated by loop effects . here , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we aim at studying the phenomenology of c2hdms in a rather model independent way by assuming the same general form of this potential as in e2hdms with a softly - broken discrete @xmath2 symmetry , the latter being imposed in order to avoid flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at the tree level . for the yukawa sector",
    ", we need to assume an embedding scheme for sm fermions into @xmath55 multiplets to build the lagrangian at low energy .",
    "we adopt here the same setup of  @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details of the model construction .    after an expansion in @xmath45 up to @xmath56",
    ", we obtain the following interaction lagrangian relevant to single- and double-@xmath0 production : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a charged(neutral ) massive gauge boson , @xmath9(@xmath59 ) is a sm fermion(anti - fermion ) and @xmath60 represents a ( pseudo)scalar boson . notice that the dimension five term @xmath61 appears in c2hdms because of their non - linear properties . using this notation ,",

    "we note that the above expressions of the top yukawa couplings are common to all the four types of yukawa interactions ( i , ii , x and y )  @xcite , so that there is no type dependence in the cross section of the process where only @xmath0 is mediated such as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the latter bound is for the type - i c2hdm.,width=264 ]    finally , we investigate the @xmath206 production process , for which the representative feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ diag_tthh ] . we note ( again )",
    "that the third diagram appears at the tree level only in c2hdms , not e2hdms , as it comes from the non - linear nature of the composite higgs interaction .",
    "its effect is , however , negligibly small , because the @xmath74 coupling given in eq .",
    "( [ yukawas ] ) is proportional to @xmath45 . differently from the previous two double-@xmath0 production modes ,",
    "the @xmath76 dependence is important here , i.e. , it enters not only @xmath38 and @xmath187 but also various yukawa couplings such as @xmath148 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 ( other than indirectly via the higgs widths ) .",
    "therefore , this process is useful to extract independent information on @xmath76 or to check its consistency with other processes if @xmath209 and the masses ( plus possibly widths ) of the extra higgs bosons are known to some extent .    in fig .",
    "[ cross_tthh ] , we show the cross section of the @xmath206 process as a function of @xmath101 with @xmath210 gev and @xmath183 .",
    "we take @xmath88 , 2 and 3 for the left , center and right panels , respectively .",
    "the cross section increases when @xmath211 because the @xmath194 decay mode opens up and diagrams with the @xmath42 vertex , e.g. , the fourth topology in fig .",
    "[ diag_tthh ] , become non - zero . comparing the top ( @xmath212 tev ) and bottom ( @xmath213 tev ) panels we see that the cross section at @xmath213 tev is roughly one order of magnitude larger than that at @xmath212 tev when @xmath214 .",
    "this can be explained with the opening of on - shell @xmath215 production ( again , see the fourth diagram in fig .",
    "[ diag_tthh ] ) with the subsequent decays of @xmath194 and @xmath216 .",
    "despite in both previous figures differences between the e2hdm ( @xmath102 ) and c2hdm ( @xmath116 ) cases can be large , up to several tens of percent in the regions allowed by tab .",
    "[ sin - limit ] , again , differences between the two scenarios become very apparent if @xmath217 is fixed .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ dcross_tthh ] , we show their relative cross sections of the @xmath206 process for a fixed value of @xmath7=0.99 and 0.98 . here",
    ", we take @xmath218 gev , @xmath219 , @xmath108 and @xmath87 gev . as we can see , the deviation is negative and can be more than 30% for @xmath200 with positive @xmath101 .",
    "this is simply because of the fact that the cross section has a minimum at @xmath220 and there are no significant cancellations amongst the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diag_tthh ] .",
    "in contrast , for positive values of @xmath101 the deviation can be positive , so that relative sign differences amongst the mentioned graphs can offset the generally negative rescaling of all vertices through @xmath45 .    in short",
    ", the double-@xmath0 productions can be useful to access the @xmath45 and @xmath65 parameters by measuring the cross sections of the hs and vbf processes , since these are not simply given by the factor of @xmath7 yet they show little sensitivity to @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath206 production is instead useful to extract @xmath76 and crucial to check the self - consistency of either higgs scenario , elementary or composite , given the variety of particles and interactions intervening in it .",
    "in this study , we have continued our investigation of c2hdm scenarios , initiated by ref .",
    "@xcite and expanded in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for an overview ) , wherein the nature of all higgs bosons is such that they are composite states , i.e. , pngbs from a global symmetry breaking @xmath221 , induced explicitly by interactions between a new strong sector and the sm fields at a compositeness scale @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , for the scalar potential , we assume the same general form as in the e2hdm . within this construct , we have herein proceeded to carry out a phenomenological study aiming at establishing the potential of future @xmath1 colliders in disentangling the two hypotheses , e2hdm versus c2hdm .",
    "these machine environments afford one with a very high precision achievable in measuring the sm - like @xmath0 production cross section in both single- and double-@xmath0 mode , so that the rather different patterns emerging in the composite scenario with respect to the elementary one may effectively be tested .",
    "we have proven this to be the case for all available modes : i.e. , hs , vbf and associated production with top quarks . separation between the two non - minimal elementary and composite higgs hypotheses can potentially ( i.e. , depending on the values of @xmath101 and @xmath45 but irrespectively of @xmath76 ) be achieved in all channels . in fact , for some combinations of @xmath101 and @xmath45 , the c2hdm produces large , and typically negative , corrections to the sm coupling strengths , up to order @xmath222 or so , that can not ever be obtained in the e2hdm , thereby enabling one to promptly distinguish between the two scenarios .",
    "in other cases , when similar deviations can be obtained in both scenarios within expected accuracy for some ( different in the two models ) combination of inputs , one has to resort to a multi - dimensional fit assessing the cl in either hypotheses . yet , even in this case , we expect the separation to be possible .",
    "we have reached these conclusions assuming a type - i setup in the yukawa sector , although we have argued that our results are independent of the interactions of the higgs states with fermions , as the yukawa dependence only enters in higher orders through the width of the heavy cp - even and cp - odd states , at least for the @xmath0 production modes we have considered .",
    "only the experimental constraints are in fact type dependent , yet the above prospects about the possibility of disentangling the two 2hdm realisations persist for all types .",
    "this has been achieved in presence of theoretical and experimental constraints , the latter extrapolated to the end of the lhc era , assuming both a standard ( up to 300 fb@xmath3 ) and hl ( up to 3000 fb@xmath3 ) setup for it .",
    "we are therefore lead to conclude that future electron - positron colliders operating between 500 and 2000 gev , of which there exist several prototypes ( such as the aforementioned ilc @xcite , but also the compact linear collider ( clic )  @xcite and future circular collider @xmath1 ( fcc - ee ) @xcite ) , are the ideal testing ground to confirm or disprove the existence in nature of either a e2hdm or c2hdm as the underlying dynamics of electro - weak symmetry breaking .",
