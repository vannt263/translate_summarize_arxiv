    "despite of the fact that the top quark is the heaviest known particle , with a mass comparable to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , its dynamical behavior is rather restrictive . within the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the top quark production cross section is evaluated with an uncertainty that is of the order of @xmath13 and top quarks are assumed to decay to a @xmath14 boson and a @xmath15 quark almost @xmath16 of the time . due to its exceedingly heavy mass , it is reasonable to expect the top to be more related to new physics than other fermions .",
    "top quark physics may then serve as an important window for probing physics beyond the sm .",
    "although some properties of the top quark have already been examined at the tevatron@xcite , a further scrutiny is expected at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which will operate as a veritable top quark factory , producing about eight millions of @xmath17 events per year in its first stage , and hopeful up to about eighteen millions in subsequent years@xcite .",
    "other relevant studies will be realized in the next generation @xmath18 linear colliders .",

    "in the sm , the yukawa sector is both cp and flavor conserving .",
    "cp and flavor violation can be generated at the tree level if new scalar fields are introduced .",
    "another alternative , which does not contemplate the introduction of new degrees of freedom , consists in incorporating into the classical action the virtual effects of the heavy degrees by introducing @xmath19invariant operators of dimension higher than four .",
    "a yukawa sector with these features has the following structure@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 stand for the usual components of the yukawa matrix , the left  handed lepton doublet , the left  handed quark doublet , the higgs doublet , the right  handed charged lepton singlet , and the right  handed quark singlets of down and up type , respectively .",
    "the @xmath28 numbers are the components of a @xmath29 general matrix , which parameterize the details of the underlying physics , whereas @xmath30 is the typical scale of these new physics effects . after spontaneous symmetry breaking , this extended yukawa sector can be diagonalized as usual via the unitary matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which relate gauge states to mass eigenstates . in the unitary gauge",
    ", the diagonalized lagrangian can be written as follows : @xmath33 where the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are the diagonal mass matrix and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are vectors in the flavor space . in addition , @xmath39 are matrices defined in the flavor space given by @xmath40 the above effective lagrangian describes the most general coupling of renormalizable type of a scalar field to pairs of fermions .",
    "this reproduces the main features of most of extended yukawa sectors , as the most general version of the two  higgs doublet model ( thdm - iii)@xcite and multi  higgs models that comprise additional multiplets of @xmath41 or scalar representations of larger gauge groups .",
    "our approach also cover more exotic formulations of flavor violation , as the so  called familons models@xcite or theories that involves an abelian flavor symmetry@xcite .",
    "results , presented in this paper , are then applicable to a wide variety of models that predict scalar  mediated flavor violation .",

    "now , in order to evaluate the branching ratio br@xmath49 br@xmath50 @xmath51 br@xmath52 we need to calculate the following two terms : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "the contribution of the @xmath56 vertex to the magnetic and electric dipole moments of the @xmath57 fermion have been calculated and the electromagnetic dipoles of @xmath42 can be written as follows : @xmath58 we now are in position of using low  energy data to bound the @xmath59 and @xmath60 parameters .",

    "thus , the contribution of the @xmath64 vertex must be less than this uncertainty:@xcite @xmath65 in order to constrain the @xmath66 term , we used the very stringent experimental limit coming from the neutron electric dipole moment@xcite : @xmath67 the @xmath68 and @xmath69 magnetic and electric dipole moments , respectively , are related with those of their elementary constituents through the following expressions : @xmath70 assuming that the new physics contributions to @xmath71 and @xmath72 arise exclusively from the quark @xmath73 , as in this case @xmath74 and assuming , as usual , @xmath75 we finally get : @xmath76 @xmath77 ( as matter of fact for @xmath78 gev@xmath10 we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) we can write : @xmath81 in figure  [ otu].a , we show the behavior of @xmath82 as a function of the higgs mass .    branching ratio for the @xmath44 decay as a function of the higgs mass.,width=268 ]      the best experimental limits on the @xmath83 anomalous magnetic moment , and on the electric dipole moment are@xcite : @xmath84 in this case we obtain : @xmath85 this time we have @xmath86 @xmath87 ( as matter of fact for @xmath78 gev@xmath10 we get @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) . in order to simplify the analysis",

    "we are now able to evaluate the branching ratio for the decay @xmath0 as a function of the higgs mass : br@xmath49 br@xmath50 @xmath51 br@xmath52 .",

    "a @xmath96 pair can then decays as follows : a ) purely sm decays ( sm - sm ) , where both the top quarks decay into @xmath97 ( br@xmath98 ) ; b ) mixed sm - dfv decays , where one top will decay into @xmath97 and the other into @xmath99 ( br@xmath100 @xmath101 ) ; c ) purely dfv decays ( dfv - dfv ) , in this case both the top quarks will decay into @xmath99 ( @xmath102 ) .",
