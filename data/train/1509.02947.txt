    "this model of computation can also be understood in terms of teleportation - based quantum computation in the valence - bond solid ( vbs ) formalism  @xcite , as well as the so - called correlation - space quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "a local measurement in mbqc corresponds to a joint measurement on partons of the vbs ( which are to be understood as virtual qubits ) within one physical site  @xcite and the resources in the two equivalent models are related by a mathematical projection .",
    "since the discovery of the one - way computer  @xcite on the square - lattice cluster state  @xcite , there have been quite a few other universal resources states uncovered , including , for example , graph states  @xcite , the tricluster state  @xcite , weighted graph states  @xcite , modified toric code states  @xcite , and affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) states  @xcite on various lattices  @xcite and their deformations  @xcite .",

    "@xcite the utility of spt phases for quantum computation in 1d has also been demonstrated for other symmetry groups beyond the @xmath0 symmetry .",

    "systems with spt order ( spto ) can be robust against small local perturbations that respect the symmetry  @xcite",
    ". ground states of spt phases can be mapped to product states with local unitary ( lu ) transformations and thus , are short - range entangled ( sre ) .",

    "moreover , we shall show that such entanglement structure defined on general 2d lattices is a universal resource .",
    "but does it also display nontrivial spto as in the square lattice ? to answer this , we explicitly extend the original symmetry construction to arbitrary lattices in two spatial dimensions . with the symmetry representation generalized",
    ", we can then show that these plaquette states and their generalizations on all 2d lattices indeed exhibit nontrivial spto , depending on the symmetry .",
    "we show that these states are universal resources for mbqc as long as their underlying graphs reside in the supercritical phase of percolation .",
    "this means that all ( generalized ) plaquette states on 2d regular or quasicrystallene lattices are both nontrivial spt states and universal resources for mbqc .",
    "it is interesting that whether the plaquette states and their generalizations are universal resouce states depends only on whether the underlying graphs are in the supercritical phase of percolation .",

    "since the argument is independent of the underlying lattice , we can utilize any generalized plaquette state for quantum computation .",
    "note that the logical structure of our proof implies again that we can perform the quantum computation on the plaquette state first and subsequently apply the discussed measurement pattern @xmath253 accordingly .",
    "this procedure works equally well since the measurement @xmath253 is independent of other measurement outcomes .",
    "hence , such measurements drop out of the temporal order in this model .",
    "in this paper we extend the symmetry representation of the group cohomology approach for spto by chen et al .",
    "@xcite to arbitrary lattices in order to show that the plaquette states exhibit nontrivial spto not only on the square lattice but also on arbitrary 2d lattices . in connection to quantum computation",
    ", we prove that plaquette states and their generalizations serve as universal resource states for measurement - based quantum computation as long as the underlying graphs reside in the supercritical phase of percolation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the deciding property for universality in graph states is exactly the same  @xcite . as a contrast",
    ", the aklt states , which also exhibit nontrivial spto only if translation invariance is preserved  @xcite , are known to be universal only for some regular lattices  @xcite .",
    "our initial motivation was to see if one could reach similar conclusions as in the 1d case by else et al .",
    "@xcite , i.e. that certain quantum gates ( or even better , a set of universal gates ) may be protected within the entire 2d spt phase ( at least for a certain symmetry ) .",
    "if this was the case , then spt phases would provide naturally protected resource states and could potentially yield better fault tolerance in comparison to other , topologically trivial universal resources .",
    "measurements would then only needed to be performed in certain ( symmetric ) bases , giving rise to the protected gates and possibly reducing the types of error .",
    "but we have not succeeded in doing so . as for the plaquette states , the measurement that reduces them to cluster states",
    "can be done at one step , so the fault tolerance threshold the same as that of 2d cluster states .",
    "unfortunately , this is of order @xmath297 to @xmath298 .",
    "but for 3d cluster states , the threshold is as high as @xmath299 , since the measurement patterns can simulate braiding of anyons and the topological protection can be exploited  @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can use a three - dimensional version of plaquette states and reduce them to 3d cluster states .",
    "this means that one can achieve the same threshold as for the 3d cluster state .",
    "however , we do not know whether quantum computation performed directly on plaquette states without reduction to the cluster state could result in a better threshold .",
    "similar to 2d graph states , the plaquette states can be defined on any 2d graph . however , the local hilbert - space dimension can be large , depending on the number of partons on each site .",
    "thus , it would be desirable to find projections from partons to a smaller physical subspace while at the same time preserving the nontrivial spto and quantum computational universality .",
    "moreover , we have solely demonstrated the universality of plaquette states , which are nothing but representative states in spt phases .",
    "one immediate question is whether all ground states in any or some nontrivial spt phase are still universal .",
    "these are open - ended questions for future investigation .    in this paper",
    ", we solely discuss bosonic systems .",
    "however , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that spt order exists for fermionic systems in 2d as well .",
    "in fact , plaquette states play a similar role if fermions are under consideration . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors argue that spt order in some fermionic systems can be classified by a special group supercohomology theory .",
    "furthermore , it has already been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that fermionic mbqc is possible provided that we consider additional information processing channels , namely parity modes , besides the conventional information mode .",
    "the additional modes carry the parity property of fermions . we suspect that a fermionic system defined on e.g. triangular plaquettes , fig .",
    "[ fig : plaqtrianglebond ] , exhibits nontrivial spt order and that it might also serve as a fermionic resource state .",
    "as we were finishing up this work , we became aware of a related work by miller and miyake in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors construct a specific symmetry - protected qubit state and demonstrate that it is universal for mbqc .",
