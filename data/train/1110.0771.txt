    "strongly frustrated low - dimensional magnets have attracted much attention last years @xcite .",
    "a very interesting class of such compounds is edge - sharing chains where @xmath0 plaquets are coupled by their edges mizuno , masuda , hase , malek , capogna , nitzsche .",
    "an important feature of the edge - sharing chains is that the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction @xmath1 between @xmath2 spins is ferromagnetic while the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath3 is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the competition between them leads to the frustration .",
    "a minimal model describing the magnetic properties of these cuprates is so - called f - af spin chain model the hamiltonian of which has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spin operator on @xmath6-th site , @xmath7 is the external magnetic field and the exchange integrals are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this model is characterized by the frustration parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the ground state phase diagram of the quantum @xmath11 model has been intensively studied chubukov , itoi , dmitriev , vekua , lu , richter , kuzian , kecke , sudan .",
    "the ground state of model ( [ h ] ) at @xmath12 is ferromagnetic for @xmath13 . at @xmath14",
    "the quantum phase transition to the phase with incommensurate spin correlations of the helical type takes place . remarkably , this transition occurs at the same frustration parameter @xmath15 both in the quantum and in the classical model .",
    "however , the influence of the frustration on the low - temperature thermodynamics in the vicinity of the transition point is less studied .",
    "this problem is of a special interest because recently studied edge - sharing compound @xmath16 is well described by the f - af model with the frustration parameter close to @xmath14 @xcite .    at present the low - temperature thermodynamics of the quantum @xmath11 model at @xmath17",
    "can be studied only either by numerical calculation of finite chains or by approximate methods . on the other hand , the classical version of model ( [ h ] )",
    "can be studied exactly at @xmath18 and the classical limit is a starting point for the study of quantum effects .",
    "another reason to study the classical version of f - af model comes from the following argument established for the quantum spin-@xmath19 ferromagnetic chain , i.e. for model ( [ h ] ) at @xmath20 .",
    "it was conjectured in ref.sachdev that the low - temperature magnetization of this model is a function of the scaling variable @xmath21 .",
    "according to this scaling hypothesis the normalized magnetization @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the magnetization per site ) of the quantum chain is expressed as @xmath24    this equation is valid in the scaling limit , which means that @xmath18 and @xmath25 but @xmath26 is fixed .",
    "then the dependence of the magnetization @xmath27 on the spin magnitude @xmath19 comes only via the scaling variable @xmath26 .",
    "generally , the calculation of the function @xmath28 is a very complicated problem .",
    "it was proposed in ref.@xcite that this function can be obtained from the solution of the classical ferromagnetic chain and such scaling function @xmath28 was obtained explicitly in ref.@xcite . in particular , the zero - field susceptibility @xmath29 is@xmath30    actually the conjecture of the universality of the function @xmath28 is based on the following observations @xcite : the zero - field susceptibility of the @xmath11 heisenberg ferromagnetic chain at @xmath18 coincides with that given by eq.([chihf ] ) ; the magnetization @xmath31 obtained numerically from the thermodynamic bethe - ansatz equations and plotted as a function of @xmath32 approaches to @xmath28 at @xmath18 ; the leading terms of the spin - wave expansion for magnetization coincide with those for @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , as noted in ref.@xcite , the hypothesis of the universality originates in the universal behavior of the spin - wave excitations from the ferromagnetic ground state for both quantum and classical model .",
    "for this reason it is naturally to expect that such universality remains for all @xmath33 corresponding to the ferromagnetic ground state , i.e. for @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath28 for @xmath35 ( but @xmath36 not too close to @xmath37 ) will be the same as for @xmath20 but with @xmath26 replaced by @xmath38 .",
    "really , the zero - field susceptibility @xmath39 fits very well with numerical and analytical results @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath40 vanishes at @xmath14 signalling the change of the critical exponent at the transition point .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we studied the zero - field susceptibility of the classical f - af chain exactly at the transition point @xmath41 and we have shown that @xmath42 in contrast with the low - temperature asymptotic @xmath43 for @xmath44 . as was shown in ref.@xcite the change of the critical exponent for @xmath45 is a consequence of the modification of the energy of spin - wave excitations from @xmath46 for @xmath44 to @xmath47 at @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the form of the universal magnetization curve and the scaling variable for @xmath48 ( if the universality is valid ) differ from the case @xmath35 and require a special study .",
    "another interesting problem related to the f - af model is the influence of the anisotropy of exchange interactions of the easy - axis type on the low - temperature magnetic properties of this model .",
    "this problem is actual because it is known that in the real edge - sharing compounds the exchange interactions are anisotropic and the anisotropy can be of the easy - axis type @xcite .",
    "though this anisotropy is weak it can be important especially near the transition point .",
    "in particular , it essentially changes the behavior of the zero - field susceptibility @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of weak anisotropy on the magnetic curves of the classical f - af model at the transition point . in the low - temperature limit the easy - axis anisotropy of the nn and nnn interactions",
    "have the same effect ( we will explain this fact below ) and for simplicity we consider the anisotropy of the nn interaction only , i.e. we add to hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) the term @xmath49where @xmath50 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the pure ferromagnetic case ( @xmath20 ) the similarity in the magnetic properties of quantum and classical models remains in the case of the easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "this resemblance is based on the close relation between the classical solitons and the quantum multimagnon bound complexes . in this paper",
    "we will elucidate the question to which extend the resemblance between the anisotropic quantum and classical models remains in the f - af model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the continuum version of the model is introduced and the scaling parameters are determined .",
    "the calculation of the partition function is reduced to the solution of the schrdinger equation of a special type . in section iii the behavior of the magnetization curve at the transition point is studied .",
    "the asymptotics of magnetization for low and high magnetic field are presented and relation to the quantum spin model is discussed . the numerical and analytical results for the magnetization curve in the helical phase are given in section iv .",
    "in section v the influence of the easy - axis anisotropy on the magnetic properties is studied .",
    "the summary of the obtained results is given in section vi .",
    "in refs.@xcite we studied the partition function and the spin correlation functions of the classical f - af chain in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath14 at zero magnetic field .",
    "this study was based on the use of a continuum approximation and the interpretation of the partition function as a path integral for the quantum particle in a potential well .",
    "however , the extension of the model to non - zero magnetic field and/or non - zero anisotropy needs the essential modification of this approach .    in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath14",
    "it is convenient to rewrite hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with the anisotropic term ( term ) in the form @xmath51    in eq.([h2 ] ) we put @xmath52 and omit unessential constant .    in the classical approximation",
    "the spin operators @xmath53 are replaced by the classical vectors @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are the unit vectors . in the low - temperature limit",
    "the thermal fluctuations are weak so that neighbor spins are directed almost parallel to each other .",
    "therefore , at @xmath18 we can use the continuum approximation replacing @xmath56 by the classical unit vector field @xmath57 , so that @xmath58where the lattice constant is chosen as unit length .    using eqs.([continuum ] ) hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) goes over into the energy functional @xmath59 = \\int dx\\left [ \\frac{s^{2}}{8}\\left ( \\frac{d^{2}% \\vec{n}}{dx^{2}}\\right ) ^{2}-\\frac{s^{2}(4\\alpha -1)}{2}\\left ( \\frac{d\\vec{n}% } { dx}\\right ) ^{2}-s^{2}(\\delta -1)n_{z}^{2}-shn_{z}\\right ]   \\label{e}\\ ] ]    one can easily check that in the continuum approximation the easy - axis anisotropy of nnn interactions @xmath60 results in the term @xmath61 .",
    "this term merely changes the coefficient in the third term of eq.([e ] ) , so that the results obtained below cover the case of the nnn anisotropy as well .",
    "energy functional ( [ e ] ) contains the second order derivative @xmath62 in contrast with that for the ferromagnetic chain @xcite , which contains the first order derivative @xmath63 only .",
    "this fact demonstrates an essential difference between the cases @xmath20 and @xmath64 .    the partition function is a functional integral over all configurations of the vector field on a ring of length @xmath65 @xmath66 \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{e\\left [ \\vec{n}(x)\\right ] } { t}\\right )   \\label{z}\\ ] ]    it is useful to scale the spatial variable as @xmath67    then , the partition function takes the dimensionless form @xmath68 \\exp \\left\\ { -\\int_{0}^{\\lambda } d\\xi % \\left [ \\frac{1}{8}\\left ( \\frac{d^{2}\\vec{n}}{d\\xi ^{2}}\\right ) ^{2}-\\frac{% \\gamma } { 2}\\left ( \\frac{d\\vec{n}}{d\\xi } \\right ) ^{2}-\\delta n_{z}^{2}-gn_{z}% \\right ] \\right\\ }   \\label{z2}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the scaled system length and @xmath70 are the parameters of the model scaled by temperature .    as follows from eq.([z2 ] ) the partition function and with it the low - temperature thermodynamics of the f - af model near the transition point is governed by three scaling parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the definition of the scaling parameters ( [ scpar ] ) implies that we consider the scaling limit when @xmath18 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath25 , but the values of the scaling parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath73 are finite .",
    "we express the unit vector field through two scalar fields @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 @xmath80and the magnetic field is directed along the @xmath81 axis . in terms of the fields @xmath79 and @xmath78 the partition function takes the form of the functional integral @xmath82 d\\left [ \\phi ( \\xi ) \\right ] \\exp \\left\\ { -\\int_{0}^{\\lambda } w(n_{z},\\phi ) d\\xi \\right\\ }   \\label{z3d}\\]]where the energy density @xmath83 has a rather cumbersome form : @xmath84 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}\\left [ \\frac{\\dot{n}_{z}^{2}}{1-n_{z}^{2}}+(1-n_{z}^{2})% \\dot{\\phi}^{2}\\right ] -\\delta n_{z}^{2}-gn_{z }   \\label{w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 are the first and the second - order derivatives of @xmath89 and @xmath90 with respect to @xmath91 .",
    "if we treat @xmath91 as an imaginary time then partition function ( [ z3d ] ) takes the form of a path integral of a quantum particle with the euclidean lagrangian @xmath83 .",
    "here we notice that @xmath83 comprises the derivatives @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the field @xmath78 , but does not contain explicitly the field @xmath78 itself .",
    "this allows us to rewrite partition function ( [ z3d ] ) in terms of a new field @xmath92    the energy density @xmath83 contains explicitly the field @xmath93 and its derivatives @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "presence of the second - order derivative requires the use of the special methodology developed by ostrogradski @xcite which allows to obtain the hamiltonian corresponding to the higher gradient lagrangian . in the ostrogradski formalism",
    "@xcite the independent generalized coordinates are @xmath89 and @xmath94 .",
    "that is , we treat the derivative @xmath95 as a new independent variable , so that @xmath96    according to this formalism the lagrangian ( [ w ] ) is replaced by the equivalent one @xmath97   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}\\left [ \\frac{v^{2}}{1-n_{z}^{2}}+(1-n_{z}^{2})q^{2}% \\right ] -\\delta n_{z}^{2}-gn_{z}-ip(\\dot{n}_{z}-v )   \\label{l3}\\end{aligned}\\]]where the lagrange multiplier @xmath98 ensures the equality of @xmath85 and @xmath99 .",
    "the canonical momenta are @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "therefore , we have to consider the transposed counterpart of eq.([sch3d ] ) : @xmath120    the transposed differential operator @xmath121 has the same form as @xmath122 , but the sign of the last two terms in eq.([h0 ] ) is changed .",
    "this change of sign is equivalent to the change @xmath123 , which implies that @xmath124 .",
    "then , the normalization condition for functions @xmath125 takes the form : @xmath126    as a result of the above manipulations the partition function @xmath81 can be considered as the partition function of quantum model ( [ sch3d ] ) at a ` temperature ' @xmath127@xmath128    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) only the lowest eigenvalue of eq.([sch3d ] ) gives the contribution to @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the free energy of the classical spin model is determined by the ground state energy @xmath132 of the schrdinger equation ( sch3d ) .",
    "the dependence of the lowest eigenvalue @xmath132 of eq.([sch3d ] ) on the scaling parameters @xmath73 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 determines the magnetic properties of the system .",
    "in particular , the normalized magnetization is given by @xmath133    thus , eq.([sch3d ] ) is the main result of this paper .",
    "in general , eq.(sch3d ) does not admit analytical solution and should be solved numerically .",
    "however , the limiting cases of high and low magnetic fields can be studied analytically . in the following we present both numerical solutions and analytical expressions for asymptotics .",

    "however , we can compare eq.([chi12 ] ) with the susceptibility obtained for this model by the approximate modified spin - wave method ( mswt ) proposed by takahashi takahashi .",

    ", as pointed in ref.@xcite the possible reason of the deviation of the tmrg results from eq.([chi12 ] ) is that the obtainable temperatures in the tmrg calculations are just not low enough to observe the @xmath160 power law predicted by eq.([chi12 ] ) .",
    "now we consider the limit of large @xmath73 when the magnetization is close to saturation . in this limit",

    "the second term in eq.([mtp ] ) corresponds to the result of the linear spin - wave theory , but the third one includes spin - wave interaction effect and , therefore , the coincidence is not trivial .",
    "certainly , we can not prove that both expansions coincide in all orders in small parameter @xmath174 .",
    "nevertheless , the coincidence of the leading terms of @xmath175 for the quantum and the classical model gives a promise that the universality is valid at the transition point of the f - af model .",

    "there are three lowest excited states having equal real part of their eigenvalues : @xmath183    according to eq.([cor ] ) the presence of the imaginary part in eigenvalues ( [ e123 ] ) causes the oscillations on the background of the exponential decay of the correlation function .",
    "the imaginary part of the eigenvalues determines the period of the oscillations while the real part determines the correlation length .",
    "according to eqs.([ept ] ) and ( e123 ) the asymptotic of the correlation length in the high field limit is @xmath184    so we see that the correlation length is defined by the temperature for @xmath185 and by the magnetic field when @xmath186 .",

    "finally , at @xmath201 the maximum of the spin structure factor reaches @xmath200 defining the lifschitz boundary , so that the helical type of the spin correlations for @xmath202 disappears .",
    "most likely , the hypothesis of the universality of the function @xmath175 breaks down for @xmath191 because the excitations above the ground state are different in the quantum and in the classical f - af chain .",

    "this fact manifests the close relation between the magnetic properties of the quantum and the classical anisotropic ferromagnetic chains .",
    "we will show that this resemblance remains in the f - af model at the critical point @xmath14 .",
    "for example , it was shown by us in refs.dk09,dk10 that the energies of multimagnon bound states in the quantum model and the energy of large classical solitons at @xmath14 are both proportional to @xmath249 though the numerical coefficients are different .",
    "we have also shown @xcite that the susceptibility of the quantum @xmath11 f - af model diverges at @xmath18 exponentially , i.e. @xmath250 and the thermal gap @xmath251 equals one - half of the energy of the multimagnon complexes .",
    "we will show below that the susceptibility of the classical model at @xmath252 has similar exponential behavior and the corresponding thermal gap is the classical kink energy .",
    "similar to the pure ferromagnetic chain the calculation of the zero - field susceptibility reduces to the computation of the ground state energy of eq.([sch3d ] ) in the second order in @xmath253 .",
    "then the susceptibility can be represented as @xmath254 where @xmath255 and @xmath125 and @xmath179 are the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of eq.([sch3d ] ) at @xmath137 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the normalized susceptibility @xmath256 and the normalized temperature @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) , so that @xmath259 is a function of @xmath260 only .",
    "the function @xmath261 can be found explicitly in the limits of large and small values of @xmath262 ( at small and large @xmath72 correspondingly ) . for high temperatures @xmath263 the states giving the contributions to the sum in eq.(fd )",

    "we can expand the term @xmath267 up to @xmath268 in the schrdinger equation ( [ sch3d ] ) .",

    "but there is a non - perturbative tunnel splitting which is not captured by the pt .",
    "the splitting is exponentially small at @xmath275 as demonstrated in fig.[e_delta ] .",
    "on the other hand , these quasi - degenerated states have a non - zero matrix element in eq.([fd ] ) and , therefore , the splitting between them determines the behavior of @xmath276 at @xmath265 .",
    "the most convenient way to evaluate this splitting is the calculation of the original functional integral ( [ z3d ] ) .",
    "certainly , the exact calculation of this integral is impossible and , therefore , we use a semiclassical approximation . in this approximation",
    "the functional integral ( [ z3d ] ) is represented as the sum of the contributions of the classical paths in @xmath81 minimizing the euclidean action and the paths which are close to the classical ones .",

    "in general case the function @xmath314 has been calculated numerically and the dependence @xmath261 is shown in fig.[anisot ] together with asymptotics of @xmath311 for small and large @xmath315 . as it can be seen from fig.[anisot ] the dependence @xmath311 on @xmath260",
    "is characterized by two types of behavior : @xmath311 is proportional to @xmath316 at @xmath317 and grows exponentially at @xmath265 .",
    "the crossover between two regimes occurs at @xmath318 .",
    "the calculation of the susceptibility of the anisotropic f - af model can be expanded to the case @xmath203 .",
    "we do not dwell on details of these calculations .",
    "we notice only that @xmath259 becomes the function of @xmath260 and of a parameter @xmath319 .",
    "@xmath320 as a function of @xmath260 has a minimum for @xmath321 and is finite at @xmath265 .",
    "the normalized susceptibility @xmath259 diverges at @xmath265 for @xmath322 .",
    "the line @xmath323 can be identified with the boundary between the ferromagnetic and the helical phase .",
    "finally we give the results for the magnetization of the anisotropic f - af model at @xmath14 . according to eqs.([chis ] ) and ( chidd ) @xmath175 at @xmath149 is @xmath324    the behavior of the magnetization in the high magnetic field limit is obtained by analogy with that for the isotropic case ( see eq.([mtp ] ) ) .",
    "then @xmath175 at @xmath182 is @xmath325    the magnetization curves @xmath175 for several values of @xmath72 obtained by the numerical solution of eq.([sch3d ] ) is shown in fig.[delta ] .",
    "its behavior in the limits @xmath136 and @xmath182 agrees with eqs.([mg1 ] ) and ( [ mg2 ] ) .",
    "we have studied the low - temperature magnetic properties of the classical anisotropic f - af chain in the vicinity of the transition point from the ferromagnetic to the helical ground state .",
    "this means that the frustration parameter @xmath326 is close to its critical value @xmath48 and the anisotropy of the exchange interaction @xmath327 is weak . in the vicinity of",
    "the transition point the nearest spins in the ground state are directed almost ( or even exactly ) parallel to each other .",
    "therefore , in the low - temperature limit when the thermal fluctuations are weak , we can use the continuum approximation and represent the partition function as a functional integral over the spin vector field . in the obtained energy functional",
    "the model parameters @xmath328 , @xmath329 and the magnetic field @xmath7 are scaled by the temperature and form three independent scaling parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 defined in eq.([scpar ] ) .",
    "this implies that we considered the scaling limit when @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath330 and @xmath18 , but the values of the scaling parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are finite and govern the low - temperature thermodynamics of the f - af model near the transition point .",
    "the derived functional integral for the partition function was treated as a path integral of the quantum mechanics .",
    "the peculiarity of this path integral is that the lagrangian contains the second order derivative . to handle with this problem we used the special ostrogradski prescription , which allowed us to obtain the quantum hamiltonian corresponding to such path integral in a special unusual form .",
    "then the dependence of the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian on the scaling parameters determines the magnetization curves of the system .",
    "the eigenvalue problem has been solved numerically and explicit expressions for the magnetization was obtained in the limits of low and high magnetic fields .",
    "it is known @xcite that the magnetization curve for the pure ferromagnetic chain has a universal form when plotted against the scaled magnetic field @xmath331 , and this curve is valid for any value of spin @xmath19 including the classical limit @xmath332 .",
    "we suppose that such universality remains for f - af model at the transition point against the scaling parameter @xmath333 . if this is the case the obtained magnetization curves for the classical model can be easily recalculated to the quantum spin case . to validate this hypothesis one needs to compare the obtained classical results with the magnetization of the @xmath157 f - af model .",
    "unfortunately , the exact thermodynamics of the latter model is unknown . nevertheless , there are two indirect arguments supporting this conjecture .",
    "first is that the obtained critical exponent @xmath334 in the temperature dependence of susceptibility at the transition point coincides with that obtained in the mswt method .",
    "the second argument is that three leading terms of the spin - wave expansion of the magnetization of the quantum model coincide with those for the classical model .",
    "certainly these two facts do not prove the proposed hypothesis and the question about its validity remains open @xcite . in this respect",
    "the numerical calculations of the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field at @xmath18 for @xmath11 and @xmath335 are very desirable .    probably , the hypothesis of the universality of the function @xmath175 ( if any ) breaks down for @xmath191 because the excitations above the ground state are different in the quantum and in the classical f - af chain",
    "nevertheless , as was shown in ref.@xcite some peculiarities of the low - temperature behavior of the classical model at @xmath191 is qualitatively similar to that for the quantum @xmath11 chain .",
    "for example , the temperature dependence of the zero - field susceptibility is in a qualitative agreement with the numerical data for the quantum @xmath11 model and is in accord with the experimental data for the real edge - sharing compounds .",
    "we have studied the influence of the easy - axis anisotropy on the behavior of the susceptibility at the transition point .",
    "it is shown that even weak anisotropy essentially changes @xmath155 . in the low - temperature limit",
    "the susceptibility diverges exponentially in contrast with the isotropic case where the divergence is of a power - like type .",
    "we note that such behavior of the susceptibility takes place in the quantum @xmath11 f - af chain @xcite and the corresponding thermal gap has the same functional form as the classical one .",
    "this fact confirms the close relation between the low - temperature magnetic properties of the quantum and classical f - af model in the ferromagnetic part of the phase diagram .",
