    "stellar systems with one or more compact objects can provide us with valuable information regarding the collapse of massive ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) stars and the formation of neutron stars ( nss ) and black holes .",
    "basic issues such as the relation of progenitor mass to the type and mass of the compact object as well as the effects of mass ejection or fallback are still poorly understood . furthermore , despite the accumulation of pieces of evidence for kicks imparted to nss at birth in recent years ( see @xcite1997 ; @xcite1998 ; and references therein ) the physical origin of kicks and the factors determining its magnitude and direction remain unknown .    among the different types of binaries with compact objects , double ns systems offer important advantages in studying ns progenitors and kicks , mainly because after the second supernova ( sn ) explosion these systems have not evolved in any way other than through energy and angular momentum loss due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "therefore their present observed properties can be related to the conditions just prior to the second sn in a straightforward way and can be used to constrain the parameters of the pre - sn system and the kick imparted to the second ns .",
    "such constraints on the progenitors of double ns systems have the capability of testing formation and evolutionary sequences for binary systems and thus provide input to models for the population of galactic double ns binaries .",
    "this is of particular interest , since merging double ns systems are currently considered as the most promising sources of gravitational waves ( @xcite1986 ) and a possible origin of @xmath3-ray bursts ( @xcite1986 ) .",
    "the double ns system containing the radio pulsar psr b1913 + 16 , which was discovered in 1974 by hulse and taylor ( @xcite1975 ) , proved to be the most exciting test laboratory for relativistic theories of gravity .",
    "general relativity passed this test with flying colors and provided us with detailed information about the system .",
    "continuous timing observations of psr b1913 + 16 over a period of twenty years ( 1976 ; @xcite1979 ; @xcite1982 ; @xcite1989 ; @xcite1994 ) allowed a highly accurate determination of the spin parameters , the pulsar position on the sky , the five keplerian parameters of the orbital motion , and three post - keplerian parameters related to effects predicted by general relativity .",
    "the measured values for the three post - keplerian parameters are in excellent agreement with general relativity and allow a precise determination of the ( observed ) masses of the pulsar and its companion , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the semi - major axis of the ( relative ) orbit , @xmath6 , and the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the plane of the sky , @xmath7 .",
    "the proper motion of the pulsar on the sky has also been measured with moderate accuracy ( @xcite1991 ) .",
    "in addition to spin , astrometric and orbital parameters , timing observations at different frequencies has given a precise value for the dispersion measure , dm , of the pulsar , which can be converted into a distance given a model for the distribution of free electrons along the line - of - sight .",
    "table [ p1913 ] lists all the measured and derived parameters for the psr b1913 + 16 binary system relevant to the present study .",
    "reports about changes in the relative amplitudes of the prominent leading and trailing components of the integrated profile of the pulsar by @xcite(1989 ) and @xcite(1990 ) have been explained as a result of a change in the direction of the pulsar spin caused by geodetic precession .",
    "this requires a misalignment between the orbital angular momentum and the spin of the pulsar .",
    "based on recent observations with the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope , @xcite(1998 ) also detected a decrease in the relative separation of these components , strengthening the case for geodetic precession . assuming a circular hollow - cone like beam , @xcite(1998 ) was able to derive a value for the misalignment angle of , i.e.  @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "more recently @xcite(1999 ) used pulse structure and polarization data measured with the 305 m arecibo radiotelescope and obtained @xmath10 or @xmath11 as the most likely inclination of the pulsar spin axis with a safe upper ( lower ) limit of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . in what follows",
    "we adopt this upper ( lower ) limit , since the limits on the pre - sn and kick parameters derived here become tighter for smaller ( larger ) values of @xmath14 .",
    "given our general understanding of the evolutionary history of double ns systems , the spins of the binary components and the orbital angular momentum axis before the second sn were aligned due to mass transfer in the binary .",
    "the inferred misalignment then between the pulsar spin and orbital angular momentum has been caused by the supernova kick given to the second ns and corresponds to the angle between the pre - sn and post - sn orbital planes . with this new piece of information about the misalignment angle and the proper motion measurements at hand we extend the work by @xcite(1997 ) and combine all available data for the psr b1913 + 16 binary system .",
    "we analyze the motion of the system in the galaxy and the effect of asymmetric sn explosions on binary orbits and we are able to constrain the properties of its immediate progenitor as well as its galactic velocity and the actual birth kick ( magnitude and direction ) imparted to the pulsar companion during the second sn explosion .",
    "the constraints on the kick direction have important implications for the physical mechanism responsible for the sn kick .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the position and motion of psr b1913 + 16 in the galactic gravitational potential in order to estimate its kinematic age and place of birth . in section [ relations ]",
    "we give relations between the present binary system and its immediate progenitor .",
    "these relations are applied in the final section followed by a discussion .",
    "the velocity of the center - of - mass of a binary system after a sn explosion is determined by properties of the kick imparted to the newly - born ns and the pre - sn binary parameters . here",
    ", we estimate the center - of - mass velocity , @xmath15 , of psr b1913 + 16 after the second sn explosion by making use of its measured proper motion .",
    "the proper motion of the system at present is related to a number of different velocity components in addition to the ns kick velocity .",
    "the post - sn velocity is the vector sum of the circular speed due to galactic rotation at the sn location , of the peculiar velocity with respect to this local velocity , and of the velocity imparted to the system due to the ns kick and the mass loss associated with the explosion .",
    "depending on the age of the system this velocity sum is further altered by the gravitational acceleration in the galactic potential , so its velocity relative to the present galactic environment may not be representative of the velocity of the system right after the second sn explosion .    given that the details of the complete evolutionary history of psr b1913 + 16 are unknown , to make progress in estimating the post - sn @xmath16 , we make a few simplifying assumptions , which , however , are consistent with our qualitative understanding of the formation of double ns systems ( @xcite1982 ; @xcite1991 ; @xcite1996 ; @xcite1997 ; @xcite1998 ) . the initial progenitor of psr b1913 + 16",
    "is thought to be a binary with two massive stars . at the time of the first sn explosion the system was a relatively wide binary with a typical orbital velocity of a few 10 km s@xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding center - of - mass velocity imparted to the system at the first explosion is of a similar magnitude ( @xcite1996 ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the progenitor was in the galactic plane at the time of the second sn explosion and that its peculiar velocity was small compared to the local galactic rotational velocity ( @xmath18 km s@xmath17 ; see also @xcite1995 ) . the observed pulsar is the older of the two nss , created in the first sn explosion , and has been recycled during an accretion phase .",
    "we further consider the characteristic age of the pulsar ( @xmath19myr ) to be an upper limit on the time , @xmath20 , elapsed since the second sn explosion .",
    "in fact , @xcite(1998 ) derived an upper limit of 80 myr by estimating the equilibrium period of the pulsar during the accretion phase ( spin - up limit @xmath21 ) .",
    "we take as a model for the galactic potential the model of @xcite(1989 ) ( see appendix a ) and integrate the position and velocity of psr b1913 + 16 back in time from the present values to the time of the second sn explosion .",
    "we introduce a cartesian coordinate system @xmath22 with the galactic center at its origin , the @xmath23-axis perpendicular to the galactic plane , and the sun at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 kpc and @xmath26 pc ( @xcite1997 ; @xcite1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath27-axis of our coordinate system is at a galactic longitude @xmath28 and in direction of the galactic rotation .",
    "the determination of the pulsar s present location in the galaxy requires its position on the sky and its distance from the solar system .",
    "while the galactic longitude , @xmath29 , and the galactic latitude , @xmath30 , are known with good precision , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the only distance indicator available at present is the dispersion measure based on a model for the galactic distribution of free electrons .",
    "@xcite(1991 ) give @xmath33 kpc as a distance to psr b1913 + 16 .",
    "the model of @xcite(1993 ) gives a distance of 7.1 kpc which lies within the error bars given above . for a distance of 8.3 kpc the present position of psr b1913 + 16 in the galaxy , @xmath34 ,",
    "is @xmath35 in units of kpc .",
    "hence , at present the pulsar is about 300 pc above the galactic plane .",
    "the proper motion of psr b1913 + 16 in right ascension and declination is known with about 10% accuracy ( @xcite1991 ) : @xmath36 the corresponding proper motion in galactic longitude and latitude is @xmath37 the radial velocity of the binary , @xmath38 , with respect to the solar system can not be measured or inferred from pulsar - timing observations .",
    "consequently , we treat it here as a free parameter ( @xmath39 means that the pulsar is moving away from us ) , although our calculations allow us to set limits on its magnitude .    for a specific assumed value of the radial velocity , we obtain the present motion of psr b1913 + 16 in an inertial system co - moving with the solar system .",
    "its velocity in the galactic ( @xmath40-@xmath27-@xmath23 ) frame is then simply @xmath41 the galactic velocity of the sun is the galactic velocity of the local standard of rest ( see appendix a ) plus the peculiar velocity of the sun ( @xcite1997 ; @xcite1999 ) : @xmath42    given the present position and velocity , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we calculate the pulsar s galactic trajectory back in time using a model for the gravitational potential of the galaxy ( appendix a ) . for @xmath45 km / s or @xmath46 km / s ,",
    "we find _ only _ one intersection with the galactic plane ( @xmath47 pc ) just a few myrs in the past ( case a ) . for smaller radial velocities",
    "one finds several additional intersections , a second one @xmath48 myrs in the past ( case b ) and even a third one @xmath49 myrs in the past ( case c ) .",
    "these kinematic ages , @xmath50 , as a function of @xmath38 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figage ] .",
    "the third intersection is well beyond the age inferred from the spin - up limit , @xmath21 , and the characteristic age of the pulsar , @xmath51 , and therefore we exclude this case from our analysis .",
    "given our assumption that the progenitor was in the galactic plane at the time of the second sn , we take the position and velocity of the intersections to correspond to the post - sn conditions . in what follows",
    "we consider two separate cases . in the first case ( a )",
    ", the binary pulsar has intersected the galactic plane only once , i.e.  we are seeing the direct runaway of the binary pulsar out of the galactic plane , caused primarily by the kick imparted to the system at the last sn . in this case",
    "its kinematic age is @xmath52 myr for a wide range of radial velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ figage ] ) . in the second case ( b ) ,",
    "the binary pulsar has moved from below to above the galactic plane .",
    "note that in this case , given the oscillatory nature of the motion perpendicular to the galactic plane , the time spent by the binary system close to the galactic plane ( @xmath53 pc ) at its present position , is short compared to its kinematic age ( @xmath54 ; see fig .",
    "[ figz ] ) .",
    "consequently , we consider case a as more likely .",
    "nevertheless , we will investigate both cases .",
    "if the binary system is indeed old , i.e.  case b , then there is a lower limit to its age of @xmath55 myr ( c.f .",
    "[ figage ] ) . the minimum age of 60 myr derived by @xcite(1998 ) is a result of their assumption of constant galactocentric radius for the motion of the b1913 + 16 system , which is expected to brake down for these long ages .",
    "we obtain the magnitude and direction of the center - of - mass velocity , @xmath56 , imparted to the system due to the second sn explosion by subtracting the galactic rotation velocity from the velocity of the binary system at @xmath47 pc ( under the assumption that any pre - sn peculiar velocity relative to galactic rotation was small ) . the magnitude of @xmath57 is given in fig .",
    "[ figvsys ] as a function of the radial velocity @xmath38 . , for both cases a and b. in what follows we use this magnitude as a constraint on the properties of the sn kick and of the pre - sn binary system .",
    "it is worth noting that none of the calculated pulsar trajectories in the galaxy penetrates far into the central region , where the axisymmetric model for the gravitational potential might fail to be a good approximation .",
    "in double ns systems the compactness of the two binary members excludes any mass transfer or tidal interaction between them after the second sn .",
    "any evolution of the binary characteristics is due only to the emission of gravitational waves . for a given radial velocity , @xmath38",
    ", we calculate the time , @xmath58 , elapsed since the second sn , i.e.the kinematic age of the binary system ( see fig .",
    "[ figage ] ) and use the ( first - order ) equations of @xcite(1964 ) to calculate the post - sn semi - major axis , @xmath59 , and eccentricity , @xmath60 . as discussed in more detail in @xcite(1997 ) , the various evolutionary sequences discussed in the literature for the formation of double ns converge to the same configuration before the second sn : a binary consisting of a ns and a helium star in a circular orbit ( because of an earlier common - envelope or mass transfer phase that led to the recycling of the pulsar ) .",
    "we analyze the effect of the sn explosion to the orbital dynamics of the system and we relate the post - sn parameters ( masses , orbital size and eccentricity , center - of - mass velocity , misalignment angle between spin and orbital angular momentum ) to the pre - sn parameters ( helium - star mass and orbital size ) as well as to the magnitude and direction of the sn kick .",
    "effects of the expanding sn shell on the compact companion are absolutely negligible ( c.f",

    "the ( circular ) pre - sn psr b1913 + 16 binary system is characterized by the mass of the exploding star , @xmath61 , the mass of the visible pulsar , @xmath4 , and their separation , @xmath62 . the relative orbital velocity , @xmath63 , between @xmath61 and @xmath4 @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the post - sn binary system is characterized by the mass of the ns born in the sn explosion , @xmath66 , the mass of the recycled pulsar , @xmath4 , the semi - major axis of the binary orbit , @xmath59 , its orbital eccentricity , @xmath60 , and the angle @xmath67 between the orbital angular momenta of pre- and post - sn orbits .",
    "the parameters of the pre- and post - sn binary systems determine the kick velocity @xmath68 imparted to the ns at the moment of its birth in the sn explosion . using equations in @xcite(1983 ) and @xcite(1996 ) we find @xmath69^{1/2 } \\\\[3 mm ]     v_y^k & = & \\eta\\cos\\theta-1 \\\\[3 mm ]     v_z^k & = & \\eta\\sin\\theta   \\end{array}\\right\\ }   \\quad \\eta\\equiv\\sqrt{\\alpha\\beta(1-e_f^2 ) } \\;,\\ ] ] where we used following definitions : @xmath70    during the sn explosion , the post - sn system as a whole receives a velocity relative to the center of mass of the pre - sn binary .",
    "the magnitude of this center - of - mass velocity @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) is given in @xcite(1996 ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 if @xmath75 denotes the the unit vector in direction of the orbital angular momentum of the post - sn system , then @xmath76 for the angle between @xmath77 and the orbital angular momentum of the post - sn orbit we find @xmath78 the calculations described in section 2 provide the angle between the line - of - sight , @xmath79 , and @xmath77 : @xmath80 the angles @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath7 form a spherical triangle and thus satisfy the condition @xmath83    observations have determined the masses of the post - sn system , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the semi - major axis of the present orbit , @xmath6 , and its eccentricity @xmath84 ( see table  [ p1913 ] ) .",
    "we follow back in time the evolution of the orbit as determined by gravitational wave emission and derive the semi - major axis , @xmath59 , and eccentricity , @xmath60 , just after the second sn explosion .",
    "finally , @xcite(1998 ) and @xcite(1999 ) have inferred the inclination of the pulsar spin with respect to the orbital angular momentum , @xmath14 . based on our understanding of the recycling of the pulsar , the spin axis of the pulsar ( first ns ) and the pre - sn orbital angular momentum axis are expected to have been aligned .",
    "therefore , this observationally inferred misalignment angle , @xmath14 , is in fact the tilt angle , @xmath67 , of the post - sn orbital plane relative to that before the explosion .",
    "we use all this information to constrain the ( circular ) progenitor system ( semi - major axis @xmath62 ) and the birth kick velocity @xmath68 ( both magnitude and direction ) imparted to the ns during the sn explosion of the immediate progenitor with mass @xmath61 . in order to do so , we combine the values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath67 with the results of section [ motion ] , where we discussed the present position and ( transverse ) motion of the binary system within our galaxy to calculate the center - of - mass velocity , @xmath16 , imparted to the system during the explosion as a function of the unknown radial velocity . using eq .",

    "therefore , there is an additional constraint imposed on ( @xmath62,@xmath61 ) determined by the maximum radial extent reached by the helium stars during their lifetime . based on stellar evolution calculations ( @xcite1985 ; @xcite1995 )",

    "for every allowed pair @xmath87 we can now calculate the kick velocity @xmath68 required to form the post - sn system , using eqs .",

    "can not be found for all values of @xmath38 , since values outside the allowed range lead to pairs @xmath87 that fail to satisfy conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) , ( [ cond2 ] ) , and ( [ rhe ] ) . in this way",
    ", we are able to constrain the unknown magnitude of @xmath38 in addition to the five pre - sn binary and kick characteristics .",
    "the most uncertain parameter in our calculations is the distance to the binary system and thus its present location in the galaxy . to account for this uncertainty we performed our calculations for various distances ranging from 5.9 to 9.7 kpc and plotted the most conservative constraints ( figs .",
    "[ figa1 ] to [ figb2 ] ) .",
    "figures [ figa1 ] and [ figa2 ] correspond to case a , where the pulsar is young ( @xmath52 myr ) , with @xmath92 ( prograde ) and @xmath93 ( retrograde ) , respectively . figures [ figb1 ] and [ figb2 ] give results for case b , again for the prograde and retrograde cases . both the mass , @xmath61 , of the exploding helium star and the pre - sn orbital separation , @xmath62 , are well constrained in the retrograde cases a and b and the prograde case b. the kick magnitude , @xmath91 , is better constrained in case b , while both retrograde cases require higher kick magnitudes , as expected . for all four cases the direction of the kick is narrowly constrained to be very close to the pre - sn orbital plane and opposite to the orbital motion of the exploding helium star . in the retrograde cases the angles @xmath89 and @xmath88 are restricted to extremely narrow ranges .    according to @xcite1998",
    "the observational data for the pulse profile evolution are equally well described by a prograde and retrograde system .",
    "he however argued that a retrograde system would require typically larger and therefore less probable kick velocities than for the prograde solution , and therefore considered this case as less likely .",
    "this tendency is indeed visible in the results of our calculations ( figs .",
    "[ figa1 ] to [ figb2 ] ) .",
    "more importantly , a comparison between the solid angle covered by the direction @xmath94 in the prograde and retrograde cases ( for each allowed value of @xmath38 ) indicates that the retrograde cases require a much higher degree of fine - tuning in the kick direction .",
    "for this reason we consider the retrograde cases to be less probable .",
    "it is important to point out that in all four possible cases the direction of the kick imparted to the newly - born ns is strongly restricted to be almost in the orbital plane of the progenitor system ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "since the spin of the helium star is expected to be aligned with the pre - sn orbital angular momentum due to the mass transfer in the binary , our results imply that the kick was given in a direction almost perpendicular to the spin axis of the ns progenitor .",
    "such a constraint has interesting and restrictive implications for the physical mechanism responsible for the kick in terms of the relevant direction and time scale of the process .",
    "whatever the details of the mechanism , it must be such that it can allow the kick to be directed almost perpendicular to the rotation axis of the collapsing star .",
    "further the time scale relevant to the kick mechanism must be short compared to the birth spin period of the ns .",
    "otherwise kick components perpendicular to the ns rotation would be cancelled resulting in a kick parallel to the ns spin axis , which contradicts the constraints derived here .",
    "our findings are in agreement with @xcite1997 , @xcite1998 , @xcite1999 who argue that there is no correlation between the pulsar spin and velocity vectors",
    ". we also note that if the kick mechanism is related to the escaping neutrinos during the collapse , then the spin period of the proto - ns must be longer than the neutrino - diffusion timescale ( a few seconds , @xcite1996 ) .",
    "the radii of helium stars in late stages of their evolution are not well defined quantitatively , although the qualitative result of rapid expansion of relatively low - mass helium stars is common to all the published calculations ( @xcite1985 ; @xcite1995 ) .",

    "we calculated the kinematic history of the psr b1913 + 16 system based on the model for the galactic gravitational field of @xcite(1989 ) .",
    "in particular , calculations done for the case b ( @xmath99 myr ) could be sensitive to deviations of the model from the true galactic potential .",
    "therefore we repeated all our calculations using the galactic potential model published by @xcite(1990 ) .",
    "the resulting changes in kick and orbital parameters proved to be below the 10% level .",
    "we further tested our assumption of the psr b1913 + 16 system being born at @xmath47 pc , using in addition @xmath100 pc as the galactic height at birth .",
    "our analysis turned out to be adequately robust against these changes .",
    "finally , we can use the upper limit on @xmath101 to constrain the uncertainty in the ns - mass measurements . as pointed out by @xcite(1986 ) , timing observations of binary pulsars do not allow the determination of the intrinsic masses of the binary system .",
    "instead the ( intrinsic ) masses divided by the doppler factor , which to first order is given by @xmath102 , are measured .",

    "<S> we use recent information on geodetic precession of the binary pulsar b1913 + 16 along with measurements of its orbital parameters and proper motion to derive new constraints on the immediate progenitor of this double neutron star system . as part of our analysis we model the motion of the binary in the galaxy after the second supernova explosion , and we derive constraints on the unknown radial velocity . we also obtain limits on the magnitude and direction of the kick velocity imparted to the pulsar companion during the second supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the complete set of possible cases , depending on the kinematic age of the system and the 180@xmath0 ambiguity in the pulsar spin orientation . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , we find that the natal kick must have been directed almost perpendicular to the spin axis of the neutron star progenitor , independent of the specific pre - supernova configuration . </S>",
    "<S> such a tight constraint on the kick direction has important implications for the physical mechanism responsible for the kick . </S>"
