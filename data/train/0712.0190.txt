    "the subject of topological orders poses new challenges in the understanding of new phases of matter due to novel effects in quantum many - body physics @xcite .",
    "there is by now a good deal of examples in condensed matter , like in fractional hall effect systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , short range rvb ( resonating valence bond ) models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . or in quantum spin liquids @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there exists also exactly solvable models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that are paradigmatic examples for exhibiting topological properties that can be addressed in full detail since the whole spectrum of those models is known .",
    "although topological orders typically arise in the quantum physics of two spatial dimensions , it is possible to construct exactly solvable models in three spatial dimensions and beyond @xcite .",
    "there is yet another field in which topological orders appear naturally .",
    "it corresponds to discrete gauge theories that arise as a consequence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism from a continuous gauge group down to a discrete gauge group @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in these two - dimensional topological quantum field theories , the standard algebraic language to describe the residual gauge invariant properties of the excitations",
    "is that of quasitriangular hopf algebras ( quantum groups ) @xcite .    at the same time , quantum systems with topological order provide new expectations for finding alternative ways of robust quantum computation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are several forms to set up schemes for topological quantum computation , some of them based on the braiding of quasiparticles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , some of them based solely on the topological entangled properties of the degenerate ground states , without selective addressing of the physical qubits and without resorting to braiding of excitations @xcite , @xcite , and others based on cluster states @xcite .",
    "topological orders can be thought of as new forms of long range entanglement and they are at the crossroads of condensed matter and quantum information @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . some forms of hidden topological orders in quantum spin chains can be detected with string order parameters , which in turn can be interpreted in the light of quantum information techniques , and their long - range entanglement detected with them @xcite using matrix product states from condensed matter .",
    "there are experimental proposals based on optical lattices @xcite , @xcite to implement models with abelian topological orders @xcite , and in particular , the study of the string order parameter mentioned above can also be proposed by means of these techniques @xcite .",
    "there are also proposals for non - abelian models based on josephson junction arrays @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , in addition to the largely studied case of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "one of the emblematic examples of exactly solvable models to study topological orders on a lattice is the kitaev model @xcite , both in its abelian and non - abelian versions .",
    "it captures the algebraic properties exhibited by the discrete gauge theories mentioned above .",
    "in addition , it provides us with an explicit realization of a hamiltonian on a lattice , with the bonus that it allows for a model of topological quantum computation .",
    "comparatively , there are much less works on the non - abelian kitaev model than in the abelian case ( toric code ) .",
    "this is due , to some extent , to the additional mathematical technical difficulties presented by the non - abelian case which is traditionally introduced with the language of quasi - triangular hopf algebras and their representations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here we have made an effort to explain its contents in full detail and clarity with simpler algebraic tools based on group theory and their representations .",
    "our goal is twofold : to make the model more accessible to a broader audience with a previous knowledge on the abelian toric code , and to use that simpler presentation as a starting point for considering more general models .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a family of non - abelian topological models on a lattice , such that the standard kitaev model corresponds to a particular case .",
    "more specifically , we study a two - parameter family labeled by a pair of subgroups @xmath0 , @xmath1 normal in @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is a discrete non - abelian gauge group .",
    "the particular case @xmath3 , @xmath4 correspond to the original kitaev models .",
    "the hamiltonians of the family , denoted @xmath5 , are explicitly constructed in eq . .",
    "the standard vertex ( electric ) operators are modified according to the subgroup @xmath6 , while the face ( magnetic ) operators change in accordance with @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , there are new terms entering in the hamiltonians which act on the edges of the lattice . since there is a qudit attached to each edge these are single - qudit terms . depending on the choice of the pair of subgroups @xmath7 with respect to @xmath2 , the non - abelian discrete gauge group of the whole hamiltonian @xmath5 may range from @xmath2 down to the trivial group when @xmath8 .",
    "this is so because the gauge group for these models turns out to be given by @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the new family of non - abelian models provides us with a mechanism of explicit symmetry breaking of an original hamiltonian with large discrete gauge symmetry group . in other words , this mechanism can also be seen as a symmetry - reduction mechanism , since we may have still a smaller gauge symmetry present in the hamiltonian .",
    "the new edge terms do not commute with the vertex and face terms of the original hamiltonian , but this can be compensated by slightly changing these vertex and face terms .",
    "this change corresponds to studying the regimen in which the single - qudit terms have a higher coupling constant .",
    "choosing the models this way , we can study their ground state and also the charge condensation phenomena . at least in some cases ,",
    "single - qudit terms can be understood as a mechanism for introducing string tension , or more appropriately ribbon tension , to some of the quasiparticle excitations which thus get confined .",
    "in those cases , a complete characterization of the charge types and domain wall fluxes will be given .",
    "in order to facilitate both the exposition of the results and the readability of the manuscript , throughout the main text we will be giving the main constructions and results omitting many auxiliary details or proofs .",
    "however , all these can be found in a well - ordered form in a complete set of appendices .",
    "we hereby summarize briefly some of our main results :    i/ we introduce a family of hamiltonians defined on two - dimensional spatial lattices of arbitrary topology which exhibit a variety of discrete non - abelian gauge group symmetry and topological orders ;    ii/ the ground state of the models can be exactly given and characterized in terms of open a boundary ribbon operators .",
    "in many interesting cases the spectrum of excitations can be characterized accordingly ;    iii/ the new models show condensation and confinement of the charges in the original models with hamiltonian @xmath10 ;    iv/ in order to facilitate and complement the study of the family of models , we have carried out a thorough clarification of the main properties of the standard non - abelian kitaev model . in particular :    iv.a/ the ribbon operator algebra is introduced in an intrinsic way , with the motivation to find operators that describe excitations .",
    "we study in detail and generalize the concept of ribbon .",
    "in particular , closed ribbons and a related algebra are defined , and their transformation properties described .",
    "the vertex and face operators that appear in the hamiltonian are related to elementary closed ribbon operators , showing that everything in the models can be translated to the language of ribbons .",
    "iv.d/ we give a detailed account of two - particle states , giving explicitly a basis for the states that clarifies the meaning of the labels for topological charge .",
    "v/ a description of the ground state in terms of boundary ribbon operators is given .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect.[sect_ii ] we treat the standard non - abelian kitaev model .",
    "we start explaining the terms appearing in the hamiltonian and go on characterizing the ground state and quasiparticle excitations by means of closed ribbon operators .",
    "we also present an explicit characterization of the topological charges of the model and study when single - quasiparticle states are possible . in sect.[sect_iii ] we motivate the new family of non - abelian model hamiltonians and present their generic properties .",
    "then , we show how these models exhibit topological condensation and confinement described by domain walls . to this end",
    "we make use of closed and open ribbon operator algebras .",
    "sect.[sect_conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "appendices deserve special attention since they contain the detailed and basic explanations of all the constructions used throughout the text .",
    "specifically , appendix [ appendix_a ] contains a brief summary of representation theory for group algebras , their centers and induced characters . in appendix [ appendix_b ] we perform an extensive treatment of ribbon operators , which are necessary to describe the whole spectrum of the models .",
    "we define ribbons as geometrical objects and then construct and characterize a series of ribbon operator algebras . in appendix [ appendix_c ]",
    "we study the relationship between certain ribbon transformations and the action of ribbon operator algebras on suitable subspaces , which is a key ingredient in describing the topological properties of the models . in appendix [ appendix_d ]",
    "we give some details about the local degrees of freedom that appear in the hilbert space of two - particle excitations . in appendix [ apendice_excitaciones_solitarias ]",
    "we explain why single - quasiparticle states exist in non - abelian models on surfaces of nontrivial topology .",
    "finally , in appendix [ apendice_condensacion ] we show several results needed for condensation and ground state characterization .",
    "the data necessary for building up the model , as introduced by kitaev@xcite , are any given finite group @xmath2 and a lattice embedded in an orientable surface .",
    "the edges of the lattice must be oriented , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figura_red ] . at every edge of the lattice we place a qudit , that is , a @xmath11-dimensional quantum system , with hilbert space @xmath12 with orthonormal basis @xmath13 . this way , we identify @xmath12 with the group algebra @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the hilbert space for the whole system is then @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the number of edges in the lattice . for notational convenience",
    ", we will denote the inverse of elements of @xmath2 as @xmath17 instead of the usual @xmath18 . for completeness",
    ", we give a recollection of some basic properties of the group algebra @xmath14 $ ] in appendix [ appendix_a ] .",
    "usually , when we talk about sites in a lattice we mean its vertices .",
    "however , here we will say that a site @xmath19 is a pair @xmath20 with @xmath21 a face and @xmath22 one of its vertices@xcite .",
    "the need to consider sites will be clarified later , when we discuss the excitations of the model in terms of strips associated to ribbon operators .",
    "this is in contrast with the abelian case where one only needs to consider strings both in the direct and dual lattices . as it happens , to obtain a non - abelian generalization we need to consider vertices and faces ( plaquettes ) in an unified manner through the concepts of sites , and strings and dual strings in an unified manner through the concept of ribbons .",
    "the hamiltonian of interest , as introduced in @xcite , is @xmath23 where the sums run over vertices @xmath22 and faces @xmath21 .",
    "the terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 are projectors , called respectively vertex and face operators , or electric and magnetic operators .",
    "they commute with each other . in",
    "what follows , we give their explicit form .",
    "first , we need a group of local operators at each vertex .",
    "we label its elements as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 so that they form a representation of @xmath2 on @xmath29 .",
    "the operators @xmath24 act only on those edges that meet at @xmath22 , and this action depends on the orientation of the edge , inwards or outwards @xmath22 . for example , for the vertex @xmath22 of figure we have @xmath30 where the dots represent other qudits , which do not change .",
    "these are the `` local gauge transformation''@xcite operators .",
    "the vertex operators @xmath24 that appear in the hamiltonian are projectors onto the trivial sector of the representation of @xmath2 at @xmath22 , that is @xmath31    now let @xmath20 be a site and @xmath32 denote the closed path with its endpoints in @xmath22 and running once and counterclockwise through the border of @xmath21 .",
    "that is , @xmath32 is related to an elementary plaquette",
    ". we can then consider operators @xmath33 , @xmath27 , that project onto those states with value @xmath34 for the ` product along @xmath32 ' .",
    "for example , for the site @xmath19 of figure we have @xmath35 these are the `` magnetic charge''@xcite operators .",
    "note that the orientation of the edges respect to the path is relevant .",
    "the face operators @xmath25 that appear in the hamiltonian are projectors onto the trivial flux , that is @xmath36 where @xmath19 is any site with @xmath20 and @xmath37 is the unit of @xmath2 .",
    "the operator @xmath25 can be labeled just with the face , not with the particular site , because if the flux is trivial for a site then it is so for any other in the same face .",
    "since the hamiltonian is a sum of projector operators , the ground state subspace contains those states @xmath38 which are left invariant by the action of the vertex and face operators , namely , @xmath39 for every @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "that is , the projector onto the ground state is @xmath40 in the sphere or the plane , there is no ground state degeneracy@xcite . in particular",
    ", the ground state can be obtained easily @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the state with all the qudits in the state @xmath43 .",
    "if an eigenstate violates some of the conditions it is an excited state .",
    "note that there is an energy gap from the ground state to excited states and that excitations are localized .",
    "if @xmath44 , then we say that there is an electric quasiparticle at vertex @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath45 , then we say that there is a magnetic quasiparticle at face @xmath21 . in general electric and magnetic charges",
    "are interrelated , as we will see , and one says that quasiparticles are dyons that live at sites .",
    "the excitations of these models carry topological charge .",
    "let us explain what this means .",
    "first , consider a configuration with several excitations , far apart from each other .",
    "each of these excitations has a type , a property that can be measured locally and does not change@xcite .",
    "it is this type what we refer as a topological charge .",
    "the point is that there exist certain degrees of freedom with a global , topological nature . in particular",
    ", there exists a subsystem which depends on the value of the charges and such that no local measurement is able to distinguish its states@xcite .",
    "this subsystem is thus protected and a good place to store quantum information .",
    "when two quasiparticles get close , some degrees of freedom of the protected subsystem become local .",
    "this operation , called fusion , allows to perform measurements .",
    "finally , one can perform unitary operations on the protected subsystem by suitably braiding the excitations .",
    "we will not be concerned with the particular rules that govern the processes of fusion and braiding .",
    "instead , we only want to be able to label the topological charges . but for this , as we shall see , it is enough to study certain ribbon operator algebras , which are introduced next .",
    "this section is devoted to ribbon operators@xcite , which will be extensively employed throughout the paper .",
    "the main motivation is that ribbon operators describe quasiparticle excitations above the ground state in the non - abelian kitaev model , much like string operators describe the corresponding excitations in the abelian case .",
    "a full account of the properties and definitions for ribbon operators used in this section is presented in appendix [ apendice_todo_ribbons ] , specially in [ apendice_ribb_rho ] where a basic characterization theorem for ribbon operators is proven .",
    "the basic idea behind ribbon operators is the following .",
    "first , ribbons are certain ` paths ' that connect sites ( not vertices ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figura_ribbons ] .",
    "suppose that for every pair of sites @xmath19 and @xmath46 and for every ribbon @xmath47 connecting them we have at our disposal certain family of operators @xmath48 with support in the ribbon @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , suppose that any state @xmath49 with no excitations along @xmath47 except possibly at @xmath19 and @xmath46 can be written as @xmath50 in terms of certain states @xmath51 which have no excitations along @xmath47 except possibly at @xmath46 , but _ not _ at @xmath19 .",
    "then , any state can be obtained from states with one excitation less by application of such ribbon operators . in the sphere ,",
    "where as we will see there are no states with one excitation , this means that any configuration of excited sites can be obtained from the gs by application of ribbon operators connecting these sites .",
    "thus , we are addressing a situation for quasiparticle excitations which clearly resembles that of the abelian kitaev model , where strings in the dual and direct lattice have operators attached to them that create excitations at their endpoints .",
    "before ribbons can be further considered , we need to give more structure to our lattice .",
    "in particular , we will have to deal with a ` merged ' lattice in which the lattice and its dual play a simultaneous role .",
    "the reason to consider this merged lattice is that the excitations , as commented above , are related to sites , i.e. , pairs @xmath20 of a vertex and a face .",
    "since the dual of a face is a vertex in the dual lattice , we could equally well say that a site is a pair of a vertex @xmath22 and a neighboring dual vertex @xmath52 .",
    "thus , a site is best visualized as a line connecting these two vertices , as the dashed lines shown in fig .",
    "[ figura_ribbons ] .    in order to have an oriented merged lattice , we orient the edges of the dual lattice in such a way that a dual edge @xmath53 crosses the edge @xmath54 ` from right to left ' , as in fig .  [ figura_ribbons ] . this can be done because we are considering orientable surfaces only .",
    "just as edges connect vertices in a normal lattice , we need something that connects sites in the merged lattice .",
    "these connectors turn out to be certain oriented triangles that come into two types : direct and dual triangles .",
    "a direct triangle @xmath55 is formed with two sites and an edge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figura_triangulos](a , b ) .",
    "the idea is that @xmath55 points from a site @xmath56 ( dashed side to the left ) to a site @xmath57 ( dashed side to the right ) through an edge @xmath58 in the direct lattice .",
    "note that the directions of @xmath55 and @xmath58 can either match or not , as the figure shows .",
    "a dual triangle @xmath59 is formed with two sites and a dual edge , see fig .",
    "[ figura_triangulos](c , d ) .",
    "again , it points from a site @xmath60 to a site @xmath61 through an edge @xmath62 , which now belongs to the dual lattice .",
    "again , the directions of @xmath59 and @xmath62 can either match or not , as the figure shows .",
    "just as in a usual lattice a list of composable edges forms a path , in the merged lattice a list of composable triangles forms a triangle strip .",
    "so a strip is a sequence of triangles @xmath63 with the end of a triangle being the beginning of the next one , @xmath64 .",
    "the ends of a strip are @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "a triangle strip is called a ribbon when it does not self - overlap , except possibly on its ends .",
    "a generic example of ribbon is shown in fig .",
    "[ figura_ribbons ] . for a detailed description of triangles , strips and ribbons on a lattice",
    ", we refer to appendix [ apendice_strips ] .",
    "our next task is to attach to each triangle an algebra of operators which is enough to move quasiparticles between its two ends , in the sense of . with this aim in mind ,",
    "we first define triangle operators , which are single qudit operators acting on the edge @xmath58 of a triangle @xmath55 .",
    "these operators depend on whether the triangle is direct or dual and on the relative orientation of @xmath58 .",
    "the four possibilities are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figura_triangulos ] .",
    "the corresponding operators are @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the state of the qudit at the edge @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the triangle operators @xmath69 of direct triangles are projectors , like the @xmath33 , and the triangle operators @xmath70 of dual triangles form a representation of @xmath2 , like the @xmath26 .",
    "we start considering a direct triangle @xmath55 .",
    "since direct triangles connect sites with the same face but different vertices , triangle operators for direct triangles must be able to move electric , or vertex , excitations .",
    "let @xmath71 be the two vertices of @xmath55 . then , as a special case of , latexmath:[\\[\\label{transporte_edge_directo }    @xmath49 can be expressed as @xmath73 with @xmath74 an state with no excitation at @xmath22 because @xmath24 projects out electric excitations .",
    "moreover , @xmath69 commutes with all face operators and all vertex operators apart from those in the ends of @xmath55 , so that @xmath75 has no excited spots which are not already in @xmath49 , except possibly at @xmath76 .",
    "these are the properties we were looking for and thus we define the algebra @xmath77 as that with basis @xmath78 .",
    "next we consider a dual triangle @xmath55 .",
    "since dual triangles connect sites with the same vertex but different face , triangle operators for dual triangles must be able to move magnetic , or face , excitations .",
    "let @xmath21 , @xmath79 be the two faces of @xmath55 .",
    "then , as a special case of , @xmath80 thus , any state @xmath49 can be expressed as @xmath81 with @xmath82 an state with no excitation at @xmath21 , because @xmath25 projects out magnetic excitations .",
    "moreover , @xmath70 commutes with all vertex operators apart from those in the only vertex of @xmath55 and all face operators except those from the two faces connected by @xmath55 , so that @xmath75 has no excited sites which are not already in @xmath49 , except possibly at @xmath79 .",
    "these are the properties we were looking for and thus we define the algebra @xmath77 as that with basis @xmath83 .",
    "now that we have triangle operators at our disposal , we can move quasiparticles at will , in the sense of .",
    "in particular , if we want to move an excitation from one end of a ribbon @xmath84 to the other end , we just proceed triangle by triangle . in other words",
    ", we can introduce an algebra @xmath85 which contains a family of operators @xmath86 with the properties related to .",
    "@xmath87 can be thought of as the algebra of all quasiparticle processes along @xmath47 .",
    "note that it is closed under the adjoint operator , @xmath88 .",
    "however , if we are just interested in processes were no quasiparticles are created or destroyed but in the ends of @xmath47 , as is the case for , then @xmath87 is just too general .",
    "instead , we consider the ribbon operator algebra @xmath89 , which contains those operators that do not create or destroy excitations along @xmath47 .",
    "in other words @xmath90 if @xmath91=[f , b_f]=0 $ ] for any vertex @xmath22 and face @xmath21 which do not lie in the ends of @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath92 is closed under the adjoint operator because @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "these are the operators we were searching for in : a basis of @xmath92 gives the desired operators @xmath95 , see ( [ transporte_electrico ] , [ transporte_magnetico ] ) .",
    "@xmath92 can be thought of as the algebra of processes in which a pair of quasiparticles is created in one end of the ribbon and then one of them is moved to the other end . in these terms , it is clear why excited states are expressible by means of ribbon operators acting on ground states .",
    "a particularly meaningful basis for @xmath92 , explicitly given in , consists of certain operators @xmath96 , labeled by @xmath97 , a conjugacy class of the group @xmath2 , @xmath98 , an irreducible representation of certain group @xmath99 defined below , and the indices @xmath100 , @xmath101 with @xmath102 , @xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath104 is the cardinality of @xmath97 and @xmath105 is the degree of the representation @xmath98 .",
    "the group @xmath99 is defined as that with elements @xmath27 with @xmath106 for some chosen representative @xmath107 . in order to construct the operators @xmath96",
    ", one also has to choose a particular unitary matrix representation @xmath108 for @xmath98 and enumerate the elements of the conjugacy class as @xmath109 , together with a suitable subset @xmath110 such that @xmath111 .",
    "later we will relate the labels @xmath112 to the topological charges of the model and show how the indices @xmath113 are related to local degrees of freedom at both ends of the ribbon .",
    "we will use the following notation to denote linear combinations of ribbon operators with the same topological charge label @xmath112 @xmath114 where @xmath115 .    in the case of abelian groups",
    "there are no local degrees of freedom and the elements of the basis are @xmath116 with @xmath27 and @xmath117 an element of the character group of @xmath2 .",
    "these operators are unitary and form a group : @xmath118 indeed , @xmath119 are the string operators of abelian models , and @xmath120 the co - string operators , with @xmath54 the identity character .",
    "an essential property of ribbon operators , which reflects the topological nature of the model , is that in the absence of excitations the particular shape of the ribbon is unimportant : we can deform the ribbon while keeping the action of the ribbon operator invariant .",
    "more exactly , if the state @xmath49 is such that the ribbon @xmath47 can be deformed , with its ends fixed , to obtain another ribbon @xmath121 without crossing any excitation , then @xmath122 this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figura_deformacion ] .          for",
    "a closed ribbon @xmath123 we mean one for which both ends coincide , so that we can set @xmath124 . in view of the definition of @xmath92 , in the case of closed ribbons",
    "it is natural to consider a subalgebra @xmath125 such that it forgets the single end @xmath126 . with this goal in mind",
    ", we let @xmath127 contain those operators in @xmath128 that commute with all vertex and face operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in terms of quasiparticle processes ,",
    "such closed ribbon operators are related to processes in which a pair of quasiparticles is created and one end of them is moved along the ribbon till they meet again to fuse into vacuum .",
    "closed ribbon operators play a fundamental role in characterizing the ground state of the model in a similar fashion as how closed strings are the building blocks for the ground state in the abelian case ( toric code ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of closed ribbon operators is performed in appendix [ apendice_ribbclosed_sigma ] .",
    "we first consider the smallest examples of closed ribbons , i.e. , dual and direct closed ribbons .",
    "we say that a ribbon is direct ( dual ) if it consists only of direct ( dual ) triangles . a dual ribbon like @xmath129 in fig .",
    "[ figura_cerradas ] encloses a single vertex @xmath22 , and @xmath130 has as basis the operators @xmath131 , @xmath132 . a direct ribbon like @xmath133 in fig .  [ figura_cerradas ] encloses a single face @xmath21 , and @xmath134 has as basis the operators @xmath135 .",
