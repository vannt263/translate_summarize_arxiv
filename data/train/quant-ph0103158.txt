    "we consider pure bipartite states shared by alice and bob .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the labels of their respective quantum systems , each with @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "suppose alice and bob want to transform a state @xmath1 to another state @xmath2 .",
    "they each have complete classical descriptions of the states , but they can only perform local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc )  @xcite . the transformation can be performed under many scenarios",
    ". the final state can be exactly or approximately the desired output , and the transformation can work deterministically or with certain probability .",
    "it is also possible to consider converting between an asymptotically large numbers of two different states .",
    "we consider here _ only _ the scenario of exact , deterministic , and nonasymptotic transformation using locc .",
    "if such transformation is possible , we write @xmath7 , otherwise , we write @xmath8 . a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath7",
    "was found by nielsen  @xcite , with beautiful connections to the theory of majorization . for a pure state @xmath9 ,",
    "let @xmath10 denote the list of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath11 in descending order , and let @xmath12 be the @xmath13-th element in @xmath10 .",
    "nielsen s criterion can be stated as | | _ m d _ i=1^m _ ^(i ) _ i=1^m _",
    "^(i ) an intriguing consequence of the criterion is that , even when @xmath14 , it may still be possible to transform the state @xmath1 to the state @xmath2 as part of a larger transformation .",
    "for example , @xmath15 may be true for some state @xmath16 , which functions as a catalyst  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible for @xmath17  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , interesting properties about multiple - copy transformation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 under various scenarios are investigated . in the scenario of exact , deterministic , asymptotic transformation considered in this paper ,",
    "they have derived a necessary condition for @xmath20 for some @xmath0 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "they have also made a very plausible conjecture , |^k |^k _ r k |^r |^r .",
    "the conjecture is obviously true when @xmath0 divides @xmath23 .",

    "we remark that , for fixed @xmath0 , a counterexample in @xmath29 dimensions can always be turned into one in @xmath30 dimensions .",
    "the reason is that the criteria for a counterexample involve only continuous functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the above counterexamples suffice to disprove the conjecture for @xmath24 and @xmath33 . in the following ,",
    "we describe numerical results that provide not only counterexamples but also statistics of violations of the conjecture .",
