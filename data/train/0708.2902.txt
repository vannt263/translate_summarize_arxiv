    "recent progress in understanding the features of effective forces induced by confined fluctuations , both quantum and thermal , reveals the potential relevance of these so - called casimir forces  @xcite for numerous applications , ranging from microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) to the physics of colloids  @xcite .",
    "thermal fluctuation - induced casimir forces @xmath1 acting on the confining surfaces of fluids near critical points  @xcite are of particular interest because they become largely independent of the microscopic details of the system , acquiring a _ universal _",
    "character  @xcite , and they can be switched on and off upon varying , e.g. , the temperature . moreover , by changing the surface chemistry they can be relatively easily turned from attractive to repulsive  @xcite , in contrast to the casimir force stemming from electromagnetic fluctuations , for which such a possibility is currently debated as being very desirable to avoid stiction in mems , but difficult to achieve .",
    "finite - size scaling theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) predicts that the temperature dependence of the _ critical _ casimir force @xmath1 is described by universal scaling functions which depend on the bulk universality class ( uc ) of the confined medium and on the surface ucs of the confining surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the latter are related to the boundary conditions ( bc )  @xcite imposed by the surfaces on the relevant fluctuating field , i.e. , the order parameter ( op ) of the underlying second - order phase transition . in spite of intensive theoretical and experimental efforts ,",
    "the current knowledge of these scaling functions is still rather limited even for relevant ucs such as the ising one , which characterizes the critical behaviour of simple fluids and binary liquid mixtures . in three spatial dimensions ( 3d )",
    "the only available results refer , theoretically , to films with periodic bc ( pbc ) , investigated via monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite , or field - theoretical methods ( dirichlet , neumann bc , pbc )  @xcite , and , experimentally , to complete wetting films of binary liquid mixture  @xcite belonging to the surface uc characterized by symmetry - breaking surface fields  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding bc ( @xmath2 ) of opposing surface fields reflect the fact that the two confining surfaces exhibit opposite adsorption preferences for the two species of the mixture .",
    "_ at _ the _ bulk _ critical point the dependence of @xmath1 on the thickness @xmath3 of the film turned out to be in good agreement with the corresponding theoretical predictions  @xcite",
    ". however , the determination of the full temperature dependence of @xmath1 from these very difficult experiments suffers from significant statistical and systematic uncertainties , enhancing the need of theoretical insight .",
    "indeed , several features of the associated scaling function , such as its global shape and its dependence on the spatial dimensionality @xmath4 and bc still await theoretical investigations .",
    "exact results are available in @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite ( mean - field theory ) both for ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath7 ) bc , the latter corresponding to the case in which both confining surfaces exhibit preference for the _ same _ species of the mixture",
    ". proposals to measure the temperature dependence of the casimir force between a colloid and a flat surface or between colloidal particles dissolved in a near - critical binary liquid mixture  @xcite call for a detailed theoretical analysis of the associated scaling behaviour .",
    "the relevant missing pieces , mentioned above , in the theoretical analysis of the scaling behaviour of @xmath1 require to account for the fluctuations , including the dimensional crossover occurring in a film .",
    "this is a rather challenging task , especially if the op profile is inhomogeneous across the film , as in the cases we are interested in . with these elements out of reach of current analytical techniques ,",
    "mc simulations provide a useful alternative approach .",
    "the available mc results for the @xmath8 ising model are restricted to the case of pbc  @xcite , in which the scaling function of @xmath1 can be determined  up to a normalization factor  by numerically measuring the expectation value of a suitable lattice stress tensor .",
    "the purpose of the present contribution is to present a novel approach for the mc simulation of the casimir force and to provide data for the scaling behaviour of @xmath1 .",
    "we focus on the ising uc with the experimentally relevant bc ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we also compare our results with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , providing an independent test of the method proposed therein .",
    "our method is based on an integration scheme of free energy differences and it has the advantage , compared to the latter , of providing the _ absolute _",
    "value for @xmath1 and of being applicable for arbitrary bc .",
    "the comparison with the experimental data in ref .",
    "@xcite reveals good agreement .",
    "measurements  @xcite of the equilibrium thickness of @xmath0he wetting films near the superfluid temperature @xmath9 provide an experimental determination of the scaling function of @xmath1 for the xy uc with dirichlet bc on both surfaces , corresponding to the so - called ordinary surface uc  @xcite .",
    "these bc are due to the fact that the superfluid op vanishes at the surfaces . in this case",
    "more analytical and numerical results are available . for temperatures",
    "@xmath10 field - theoretical calculations  @xcite of the scaling function are in agreement with the experimental data  @xcite , whereas its behaviour for @xmath11 has been determined by accounting for he - specific features related to capillary - wavelike surface fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , valuable information on the shape of the scaling function in the critical region has been obtained on the basis of landau - ginzburg theory  @xcite .",
    "recent mc simulations  @xcite have nicely confirmed and extended the available analytic and experimental results . since our approach differs from the one in ref .",
    "@xcite we also present our results for the scaling function in this case , providing a valuable test .    in a film geometry with thickness @xmath3 and large transverse area @xmath12 , the casimir force @xmath1 per unit area @xmath12 and in units of @xmath13",
