    "the spatial search problem is to find a marked object from an unsorted database of size @xmath3 spread over distinct locations , with the restriction that one can proceed from any location to only its neighbours while inspecting the objects .",
    "classical algorithms for unsorted database search are @xmath4 , but quantum algorithms working with a superposition of states do better .",
    "the quantum spatial search problem was first formulated on a single hypercube in ref.@xcite , and its two - dimensional version has received particular attention due to its critical nature @xcite . in our accompanying article @xcite",
    ", we have investigated the spatial search problem for @xmath5 hypercubic lattices using the massless dirac evolution operator , and obtained close to the optimal scaling behaviour of grover s algorithm @xcite .",
    "we have also developed a broad picture of how the dimension of the database influences the spatial search problem , in analogy with statistical mechanics of critical phenomena . in case of @xmath6 , the evolution operator arising from the massless dirac operator",
    "is infrared divergent ( as @xmath7 in the continuum formulation ) . that slows down spatial search algorithms by logarithmic factors in @xmath0 @xcite , compared to the optimal scaling form , and our algorithm suffers the same fate .",
    "in this article , we modify our algorithm by introducing an effective mass in the dirac evolution operator , and demonstrate how that overcomes the infrared hurdle and improves the scaling behaviour .",
    "discrete time algorithms for the spatial search problem are based on random walks . in quantum random",
    "walks @xcite , the state amplitude distribution is unitarily evolved , such that amplitude at each vertex gets redistributed over itself and its neighbours at every time step .",
    "quantum superposition allows simultaneous exploration of multiple possibilities , and this technique has become part of a variety of algorithms ( ref.@xcite provides an introductory overview ) .",
    "we study the specific case of search for a marked vertex on a square lattice with @xmath8 vertices . in our algorithmic strategy @xcite , the free dirac hamiltonian",
    ", @xmath9 diffuses the amplitude distribution around the lattice , while the potential attracting the amplitude distribution toward the marked vertex provides the binary oracle , @xmath10 upon discretising the hamiltonian according to the staggered lattice fermion formalism @xcite , the anticommuting dirac matrices are reduced to location dependent signs , @xmath11    to construct discrete and local time evolution , we need to exponentiate the terms in the hamiltonian such that the resultant unitary operators are local . the mass and potential terms are single vertex local terms , and so can be exponentiated easily . to obtain local exponential of the kinetic term connecting neighbouring vertices ,",
    "we separate the `` odd '' and `` even '' parts of the hamiltonian on the bipartite square lattice , and exponentiate each block - diagonal hermitian part separately @xcite : @xmath12 the @xmath13 blocks of the hamiltonian , corresponding to hypercubes with coordinate labels @xmath14 , are ( in terms of tensor products of pauli matrices ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 when operating on a hypercube with all coordinates flipped in sign . the factors appearing in the trotter s formula for the discrete time evolution operator then become @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we choose the unitary quantum walk operator to be @xmath20    our initial state for the spatial search problem is the unbiased uniform superposition state , @xmath21 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "our algorithm alternates between the oracle and the walk operators , yielding the evolution @xmath23^{t_2 } \\psi(\\vec{x};0,0 ) ~. \\label{evolsearch}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 is the number of oracle calls , and @xmath25 is the number of walk steps between the oracle calls . both have to be optimised , depending on the size of the lattice , to find the quickest solution to the search problem .    with iterative unitary operations , spatial search algorithms produce results periodic in time .",
    "unlike grover s algorithm , however , the maximum probability of being at the marked vertex , @xmath26 , does not reach the value @xmath27 . augmenting the algorithm by the amplitude amplification procedure @xcite",
    ", the marked vertex can be found with probability @xmath28 , and the overall complexity of the algorithm is then characterised by the effective number of oracle calls @xmath29 .",
    "we have argued @xcite that spatial search in @xmath30 dimensions obeys two lower bounds , @xmath31 following from distinct physical principles of special relativity and unitarity , respectively .",
    "the bounds cross in the critical dimension @xmath0 , where logarithmic corrections to scaling behaviour are expected in analogy with critical phenomena in statistical mechanics .",
    "such logarithmic slow down factors have been observed in earlier works @xcite , and we want to suppress them as much as possible by suitably adjusting the evolution hamiltonian .    when @xmath22 , the quantum random walk provides the fastest diffusion , minimising @xmath24 .",
    "but @xmath22 also makes the evolution operator infrared divergent in two dimensions , which spreads out the amplitude distribution in the hilbert space too much and decreases @xmath26 .",
    "introduction of @xmath32 would slow down the diffusion , but would also regulate the infrared divergence through @xmath33 . for small enough @xmath34 ,",
    "the diffusion speed ( and hence @xmath24 ) may not change much , but substantial modification of the contribution of @xmath35 modes can alter the behaviour of @xmath26 .",
    "in such a case , an optimal value of @xmath34 can be obtained by trading off the increase in @xmath24 against the increase in @xmath26 . for a finite lattice , the lattice size acts as the infrared cutoff , and",
    "so the optimal value of @xmath34 is expected to be a function of the database size @xmath3 .",

    "for @xmath50 , tulsi s algorithm reduces to spatial search using the massless dirac walk operator , which finds the marked vertex with probability @xmath51 using @xmath52 oracle calls @xcite .",
    "tulsi showed that with @xmath53 , the algorithm increases the probability of finding the marked vertex to @xmath54 without changing the scaling of oracle calls @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the algorithm largely confines the evolution of the quantum state to a two - dimensional subspace of the @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space , whereby @xmath56 @xmath57 here @xmath58 is a second moment constructed from the eigenspectrum of @xmath44 , and characterises the infrared divergence of the problem .",
    "we have also included explicit factors of @xmath59 that are appropriate for spatial search with staggered fermions , where different vertices of an elementary hypercube correspond to different degrees of freedom , and essentially only the degree of freedom corresponding to the marked vertex participates in the search process @xcite .",
    "the optimal value of the ancilla control parameter is obtained by minimising the algorithmic complexity ( where factors of @xmath59 cancel ) : @xmath60 @xmath61      tulsi s algorithm is not presented in the dirac operator language  rather the ancilla qubit is introduced in an ad hoc manner . here",
    "we relate its ingredients to the well - known properties of the dirac operator , in order to gain some physical insight in to its dynamical behaviour .",
    "consider two species of dirac particles : one with only the mass term in the hamiltonian ( completely at rest ) , and the other with only the kinetic term in the hamiltonian ( fully relativistic ) . associating the species index with the ancilla value , we have @xmath62 now ,",
    "pick @xmath34 to give the farthest unitary evolution , i.e. @xmath63 ( the sign provided by @xmath64 does not matter in this case . ) with these choices , the two species evolve independently with maximum evolution contrast .",
    "the total hamiltonian then yields the second half of the iteration in tulsi s algorithm  schematically , @xmath65    the first half of the iteration in tulsi s algorithm is a controlled oracle , conditioned on the state @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath66 for the vertices @xmath67 without the potential , it is the identity operation .",
    "that lets the `` @xmath68 '' species remain at rest while the `` @xmath37 '' species diffuses at full speed , and there is no mixing between the two .",
    "a consequence is that the amplitudes @xmath69 do not change from their initial value zero .",
    "they neither mix with the amplitudes @xmath70 nor get any contribution from the amplitude @xmath71 by a walk step .",
    "the potential at @xmath72 couples the two species , as per @xmath73 as a result , when the diffusing `` @xmath37 '' species reaches the marked vertex , part of it gets converted to the `` @xmath68 '' species and stops diffusing . at the next iteration ,",
    "part of the `` @xmath68 '' species gets reconverted to the `` @xmath37 '' species and starts diffusing again .",
    "the net effect is that the conversions reduce the number of @xmath44 operations for walks when they pass through the marked vertex .",
    "the state @xmath71 thus acts like a trap , and the concentration of the quantum state amplitude at the marked vertex increases @xmath74 .",
    "since the conversion between species pauses the walk , it can be interpreted as an effective mass , but this effective mass is unusual in the sense that it appears only at the marked vertex .",
    "the determination of the optimal value of @xmath75 requires an analysis of the eigenspectrum of the operator @xmath44 . as shown by tulsi @xcite , when the evolution is largely confined to a two - dimensional subspace of the hilbert space , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "note that for @xmath78 , eq.([coupling ] ) implies that the two species decouple completely .",
    "so the mixing of species per iteration is tiny .",
    "also , the target state is essentially the trap state , @xmath79 , which is reached from the initial state @xmath47 with @xmath28 probability by accumulating the mixing of species over many iterations .",
    "the trapping of the quantum amplitude , resulting from an effective mass at a specific location , is a noteworthy feature  it can be an important ingredient in physical applications of the algorithm .",
    "we carried out numerical simulations of our quantum spatial search algorithm , with a single marked vertex , and both with and without ancilla control . the choice to keep the walk matrices ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , as well as the ancilla operators ( @xmath82 and @xmath42 ) , real was convenient for numerical simulations .",
    "as in the case of our @xmath5 simulations @xcite , we first scanned for the best values of the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath25 to optimise the algorithm .",
    "we again found that correlated @xmath84 pairs simultaneously maximise @xmath26 and minimise the corresponding value of @xmath24 .",
    "with increasing @xmath25 , @xmath26 increases somewhat and @xmath24 decreases slightly , but they are minor improvements .",
    "the major difference was observed in the dependence of the optimal parameters on the lattice size . without ancilla control and for fixed @xmath25 , the optimal @xmath26 decreases and the optimal @xmath83 increases with increasing @xmath85 .",
    "the variable @xmath86 is somewhat larger then @xmath87 ( the value found in case of @xmath5 @xcite ) , and increases with increasing @xmath85 .",
    "this dependence on the lattice size is a consequence of the infrared divergence , whereby all the spatial modes do not contribute to the search process with equal strength . on the other hand , with ancilla control and for fixed @xmath25 ,",
    "the optimal values of @xmath26 and @xmath83 show little dependence on @xmath85 .",
    "the variable @xmath88 is still a bit larger than @xmath87 , but it is more or less a constant .",
    "these features indicate that the infrared divergence of the spatial modes is brought under control .    for concreteness in further analysis",
    ", we stuck to the parameter choice @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which is close to the optimal choice , both with and without ancilla control .",
    "it is not easy to theoretically estimate @xmath91 , and hence determine the ideal proportionality constant between the control parameter @xmath92 and @xmath93 . to figure that out numerically , we performed simulations with three different choices : @xmath94 .",
    ".fit parameters for peak probability without ancilla [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for the spatial search problem , @xmath0 is the critical dimension where infrared divergences appear .",
    "introduction of a mass term in the evolution operator can suppress infrared divergences , and we have reinterpreted tulsi s ancilla control of the spatial search algorithm as introduction of an effective mass at the marked vertex .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate how ancilla control improves the scaling behaviour of the spatial search algorithm in @xmath0 . in particular , they agree with tulsi s predictions @xcite , and validate his analysis criterion that the evolution of the quantum state is largely confined to a two - dimensional subspace of the @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the change in scaling of @xmath26 with ancilla control is a clear signal for suppression of the infrared divergence .",
    "asymptotic behaviour of @xmath24 does not change , however .",
    "it retains the @xmath95 factor beyond the lower bounds in eq.([bounds ] ) , indicating that some effect of the critical behaviour survives .",
    "generically , logarithmic factors can not be fully eliminated in critical dimensions for interacting models of statistical mechanics .",
    "still it is an open question , whether the logarithmic factors found in tulsi s algorithm correspond to the minimal extra cost to be paid for the @xmath0 spatial search problem , or whether they can be reduced further ."
