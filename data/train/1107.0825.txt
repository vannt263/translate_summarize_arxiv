    "the development of very large liquid argon time projection chambers ( lar tpcs ) , with a fiducial mass up to 100 kton , is being actively pursued in the framework of tackling the following topics :    * neutrino oscillations , in particular to study cp violation in the leptonic sector with a sensitivity far superior to running / approved experiments as t2k @xcite and no@xmath0a @xcite ; * proton decay searches , where lar tpcs can provide unprecedented sensitivity especially in the decay channels with a kaon in the final state , with good complementarity to searches with water cherenkov detectors ; * astrophysical neutrinos , i.e. neutrinos from stellar collapse , solar neutrinos etc .",
    "this is essentially a continuation of the the physics program covered by a large water cherenkov as superkamiokande @xcite , which has operated successfully for more than a decade , therefore setting strict requirements on the sensitivity of any future experiment .",
    "liquid argon is a persistent candidate because the lar tpc technology offers significant improvements on key parameters with respect to water cherenkov detectors , namely : energy resolution , excellent control over background , good signal efficiency over the relevant energy range , and a detailed pictorial reconstruction on an event - by - event basis , much as in a bubble chamber .",
    "another key parameter of lar tpc is the possibility to scale up to the needed size , of the order of 100 kton in the fiducial volume ; for a review , see @xcite .",
    "so far , the icarus @xcite experience has produced the largest operating lar tpc , the icarus t600 , which comprises two separate modules for a total mass of about 600 ton and is now taking data in the lngs . in order to deliver the needed sensitivity",
    ", a next generation lar tpc has to be scaled up by a factor larger than 100 from the current state of the art .",
    "various proposals exist to bridge the gap in detector mass ; here we present the glacier concept and related r&d activities .",
    "the basic concept of glacier was originally put forward in @xcite , where many details can be found .",
    "the key points of the proposed design are :    * single module non - evacuable cryogenic tank based on industrial liquefied natural gas ( lng ) technology , of cylindrical shape with excellent surface / volume ratio ; * simple , scalable detector design , possibly up to 100 kton ; * single very long vertical drift ( up to 20 m ) with full active mass ; * for the readout structure , a very large area , up to 3500 m@xmath1 , instrumented with large electron multipliers ( lem ) operating in double phase argon ( liquid - vapor ) ; * possibly immersed visible light readout for cherenkov imaging ; * possibly immersed ( high t@xmath2 ) superconducting solenoid to obtain a magnetized detector ; * reasonable excavation requirements ( @xmath3250,000 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "such a design requires a suite of r&d activities to asses the feasibility of the concept .",
    "these activities are the topic of this work , and four of them are presented in more detail :    * lem r&d work at cern ; * the ardm dark matter experiment ; * experimental study of ar purity in a non - evacuable 6m@xmath4 vessel ; * the t32@j - parc experiment .",
    "the critically important item of a proper underground location has been extensively addressed in the framework of laguna ( large apparatus for grand unification and neutrino astrophysics ) @xcite .",
    "the laguna design study is dedicated to the feasibility of very large underground infrastructures able to host the next generation neutrino physics , astroparticle physics and proton decay experiments .",
    "it is conducted in the spirit of an european - wide coordination and is supported by the ec fp7 program .",
    "the laguna design study considers three different detector technologies ( liquid scintillator , liquid argon and water cherenkov ) , and seven potential underground sites , in order to identify the scientifically and technically most appropriate and cost - effective strategy for future large scale underground detectors .",
    "seven technical reports have been produced and made available .",
    "in a lar tpc , the charge produced by ionizing particles in liquid argon is drifted by an applied electric field towards the readout electrodes . in the case of a lar lem",
    "- tpc the readout electrodes are in the vapor phase , above the liquid surface .",
    "therefore the electrons are extracted at the liquid - vapor interface by means of an appropriate electric field . in the vapor phase , townsend avalanche takes place in the high electric field regions confined in the lem holes , similar to the situation of the gas electron multiplier ( gem ) @xcite .",
    "the lem is a macroscopic hole electron multiplier built with standard pcb techniques .",
    "the amplified charge induces a detectable signal on a set of segmented electrodes , proportional in amplitude to the ionization charge , therefore giving both calorimetric and spatial information .",
    "a 3l lar lem - tpc has been built and operated at cern to test different lem designs under realistic conditions . in this setup ,",
    "the lar drift volume has a cross - section of 10@xmath510 cm@xmath1 and the distance between cathode and lar surface can be extended up to 30 cm .",
    "the lar scintillation light is detected by a hamamatsu r6237 - 01 photomultiplier tube , coated with the wavelength shifter tetraphenylbutadiene ( tpb ) and placed below the optically transparent cathode grid , electrically shielded by a grounded protection grid .",
    "the uniform drift field is defined by equally - spaced rectangular field shaping rings , one every 5 mm , connected to a chain of 940 m@xmath7 resistors . on top of the drift volume",
    "there are two parallel extraction grids with a wire pitch of 5 mm and a gap of 10 mm between them , the lower one immersed in lar and the upper one in ar vapor , which allow to apply an electric field across the lar surface , and to set it independently of the drift field .",
    "the level of the lar is controlled with millimeter precision by a capacity measurement of the two grids .",
    "the lem readout is mounted 10 mm above the upper grid .",
    "after testing several lem configurations @xcite , a very promising design has been successfully selected , with a single 1 mm thick lem amplifying stage and a two dimensional projective readout anode with 3 mm pitch readout @xcite . a stable gain larger",
    "than 25 has been achieved with this detector configuration corresponding to a signal - to - noise ratio exceeding 200 for minimum ionizing tracks .",
    "an example of an event recorded in this configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_evt ] .",
    "it should be stressed that with the 2d projective anode the two orthogonal views are completely equivalent , while in a lar tpc with a wire chamber readout one typically has to distinguish between the collection view and the induction view , with different behavior in terms of signal shape and signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "the thick curve shows the result of the signal fit using the response of the preamplifier . from @xcite . ]    for a glacier type detector , square - meter size lem and projective anode are needed , in order to cover the entire readout plane with a large but still acceptable number of modules .",
    "a 40@xmath580 cm@xmath1 `` readout sandwich '' , i.e. lem plus matching 2d projective anode ( see fig .  [ f_anode ] ) , has been produced , with the same geometry of the 10@xmath510 cm@xmath1 lem tested in the 3l lar lem - tpc setup and described in @xcite , i.e. pcb thickness 1 mm , hole diameter 500 @xmath8 m , hole pitch 800 @xmath8 m , dielectric rim size @xmath950@xmath8 m ; it is presently being tested at cern",

    "ardm is an experiment designed for the direct search of wimp dark matter @xcite .",
    "it has been built and commissioned at cern in the past few years and is now approved for installation in lsc ( laboratorio subterrneo de canfranc ) in 2011 .",
    "the ardm detector is a 1-ton two - phase lar detector , with independent charge and light readout optimized for the detection of low energy events , in the 10 - 100 kev range .",
    "wimp interactions on an argon nucleus are expected to produce a nuclear recoil , much similar to the ones from elastic scattering of mev neutrons , with an exponentially falling recoil spectrum . with an energy threshold of 30 kev ( for nuclear recoils ) and wimp - nucleus cross section of 10@xmath10 cm@xmath1 ,",
    "not yet excluded by current limits , about one event per day is expected in ardm . together with having a sizeable detector sensitive to low energy interactions , a key parameter for direct dark matter searches is also a high discrimination power against background in the relevant energy range .",
    "the lem tpc readout , with mm position resolution on each spatial coordinate , helps background rejection through accurate fiducial volume cuts and separate detection of multiple interactions within the same event . in terms of rate",
    ", the background in a carefully designed 1-ton lar detector will be dominated by the presence of @xmath11ar , which is a beta emitter ( q - value 565 kev and a half - life of 269 years ) present in natural argon with a concentration of 8@xmath510@xmath12 , resulting in an activity of about 1 bq / kg @xcite .",
    "lar offers an extremely good discrimination between beta and nuclear recoils , based on a combined analysis of the charge / light ratio and pulse shape for the scintillation light . in ardm , the present light readout of the prompt scintillation light is done using 14 cryogenic photomultipliers immersed in lar .",
    "the detailed description of this system can be found in @xcite .",
    "3d of the fully assembled ardm detector . on the left , the cooling system , on the right , the detector , with the photomultiplier tubes at the bottom of the active volume . ]    while ardm is a stand - alone experiment pursuing a well defined physics program , some of the developed technical solutions are of immediate interest for glacier , in particular for the cathode high voltage and the lar lem - tpc charge readout .",
    "the lem charge readout is very similar to the one envisioned for glacier , and is studied in a common r&d program .",
    "the main difference , compared to the glacier case , is the large gain required in order to detect the few electrons which can be extracted following a nuclear recoil in lar .",
    "in fact , the ionization from a nuclear recoil in liquid argon is highly quenched , and for the same energy loss a nuclear recoil produces about 4% of the free ionization charge when compared to a beta electron . considering that , with optimized low noise electronics , the energy threshold for the detection of an ionization signal ( beta electron ) without charge multiplication ( gain=1 ) is @xmath13100 kev , it is clear that a gain of several hundreds is needed in order to detect a nuclear recoil of 30 kev .",
    "this large gain is in principle obtainable with a double stage lem .",
    "the cathode high voltage of ardm is provided using a 210 stages greinacher ( cockroft - walton ) circuit , built to sustain up to 400 kv @xcite .",
    "it has been stably operated in liquid argon at 70 kv ( 0.6 kv / cm drift field in ardm ) in fully operational configuration .",
    "liquid argon purity in a non - evacuable vessel is one of the critical design parameters for a glacier type detector . in the icarus approach ,",
    "the tpc is housed in a vacuum vessel , and obtaining a good vacuum allows to remove air from the vessel prior to filling with lar , help outgassing from the tpc materials and the vessel walls , and verify the integrity ( tightness ) of the vessel itself . commercially available",
    "lar , which is an acceptable starting point for farther purification in the liquid phase , is handled , transported and stored without using high vacuum vessels , and has an o@xmath14 content of about 1 ppm .",
    "therefore it looks very reasonable to expect that at least the removal of the air can be easily achieved without vacuum , and air in a closed vessel can be efficiently displaced by a flow of ar gas .",
    "this technique for reducing the air concentration down to the ppm level using a 6 m@xmath4 vessel has been tested experimentally , and results are presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "this work is the first step of a targeted experimental activity to verify the feasibility and to study the practical details of purging a large , fully instrumented , non - evacuable vessel from air down to ppm level air concentration through flushing with ar gas , and to fill with ultra - pure liquid ar ( ppt level concentration of residual impurities ) .",
    "a 250l lar tpc is being developed in a collaboration between kek , iwate university , waseda university and eth , for the t32@j - parc experiment .",
    "the detector itself is an innovative step in the direction of a dual - phase , glacier - like lar tpc .",
    "the goal of the experimental project is to perform measurements with well defined charged particle beams , in order to benchmark the performance of the detector and develop analysis and software tools for lar tpc detectors , starting from large samples of positrons , pions , kaons and protons in lar . a preliminary version of the detector has already been exposed to the k1.1br beam in october 2010 and about 170,000 events have been collected . for the initial test , a cryogenic vessel from the meg experiment has been used , which has now been replicated and replaced with a new one . this preliminary version is equipped with a 1d readout plane , with 76 strips with 1 cm pitch , running orthogonal to the beam , working as single phase lar tpc ( see fig .  [ f_250l ] ) .",
    "as discussed , the full lem readout is presently being commissioned at cern .     left : readout plane of the t32@j - parc lar tpc , with 76 1 cm wide strips .",

    "several lar detectors have been developed at cern and kek to address the r&d needs of glacier .",
    "in particular the 3l setup has been a workhorse for developing the lem charge readout .",
    "we are now working on devices at the ton - scale , like ardm and t32@j - parc . in the near future ,",
    "we plan to fully instrument a 6 m@xmath4 device ( 10 ton scale ) as a double phase imaging detector . on a longer timescale",
