    "in this work we study the laplace transforms of non - negative additive functionals of markov chains by the use of the method of perturbation of operators .",
    "this method , introduced by nagaev @xcite and by le page and guivarch @xcite to prove a wide class of limit theorems ( central limit theorem , local limit theorem , large and moderate deviations principles ) , has known an impressive development in the past decades ( e.g.  see @xcite and the references therein ) . with the use of the classical operator perturbation method , laplace transforms of additive functionals of markov chains have been studied in many works .",
    "let us mention namely @xcite .",
    "these works , motivated by large deviations estimates , require some exponential moment assumptions and the continuity of the family of operators acting on the reference banach space . + in the present work , we weaken these assumptions .",
    "since we consider here non - negative observables , we do not require any exponential moment assumption .",
    "but the price to pay is that , in general , the classical perturbation method does not apply in our context to the family of laplace operators ( see remark  [ rem - method ] for details ) .",

    "this is allowed by the keller and liverani perturbation theorem @xcite(e.g .",
    "see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the fact that we work with several spaces ( due to our weak moment assumptions ) complicates our study compared to the classical approach .",
    "actually we study different properties of the laplace transforms of non - negative additive functionals of markov chains , namely their multiplicative ergodicity and the continuity and derivability of the radius of convergence of the laplace - generating function , together with their spectral counterparts .",
    "we emphasize also on some applications of our result in the study of the bifurcating processes developed in [ 20 ] .",
    "the present work provides examples coming from a markovian context satisfying some assumptions of @xcite .",
    "we investigate in particular a multiplicative ergodicity property and its spectral analogous .",

    "[ results ] , we introduce the notion of multiplicative ergodicity we are interested in , our notations and we state our main results .",
    "we namely state general conditions ensuring the multiplicative ergodicity of an additive functional of a geometrically ergodic markov chain .",
    "we illustrate our general result by two examples of markov chains : the knudsen gas model and some linear autoregressive models .",
