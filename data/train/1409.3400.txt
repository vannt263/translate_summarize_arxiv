    "type ii - plateau supernovae ( sne iip ) represent a major group of core - collapse supernovae ( cc sne , see @xcite for a review ) , characterized by a nearly constant optical luminosity for about 3 - 4 months after the peak .",
    "special attentions have been paid to the sne iip showing low ejecta velocities ( hereafter lv sne iip ) because of their unusual properties in some aspects .",
    "the well - studied example include sn 1997d @xcite and sn 2005cs @xcite .",
    "these lv sne iip generally show a low - luminosity plateau lasting for about 100 days , followed by an under - luminous exponential tail at late times .",
    "their spectra show prominent but narrower p - cygni profiles .",
    "@xcite suggested that these lv objects are at the faint end of the luminosity distribution of sne iip .",
    "@xcite recently presented observations of five faint sne iip ( sne 1999gn , 2002gd , 2003z , 2004eg , and 2006ov ) . combining with the published sne iip with low luminosities ( e.g. , sn 1994n , sn 1997d , sn 1999br , sn 1999eu",
    ", sn 2001dc , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; sn 2005cs , @xcite ; sn 2008 in , @xcite ) , they found that all faint sne iip have ejecta velocities below @xmath01000 km s@xmath1 at the end of the plateau , and the @xmath6ni mass ejected in the explosion is smaller than 0.01 m@xmath8 .",
    "it is also suggested that those subluminous sne iip with low ejecta velocities probably originate from less energetic explosions of intermediate - mass stars , with an initial mass in the range of 10 - 15m@xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ` gap - filler ' events like sn 2008 in @xcite and sn 2009n @xcite were recently reported , which showed a striking resemblance to the faint event sn 1997d but produced more @xmath6ni , i.e. , @xmath00.015 m@xmath8 for sn 2008 in and @xmath00.02 m@xmath8 sn 2009n .",
    "in this paper we present optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) data of another low - velocity object sn 2013am , obtained through an observational campaign that lasted for about one year on several telescopes .",
    "the spectral evolution of sn 2013am shows an overall similarity to that of sn 2005cs which is known for its low expansion velocity and low luminosity .",
    "observations and data reductions are described in section [ sect : obs ] , the uv and optical light and color curves are presented in section [ sect : lc ] , while the spectral evolution is shown in section [ sect : spe ] . in section 5",
    ", we estimate the explosion parameters such as the absolute magnitudes , quasi - bolometric light curve , and the @xmath6ni mass ejected in the explosion . a brief discussion about diversities of sne iip is also given in section [ sect : discu ] .",

    "the presence of these transition objects confirms the hypothesis of a continuous distribution in explosion parameters of sne iip . in the m@xmath118velocity space ,",
    "however , the separation of sn 2013am from other low - velocity sne iip is not distinct , though it appears still brighter for r@xmath65 = 3.1 .",
    "moreover , we notice that the low - velocity sample of sne iip seems to show large scatter in synthesized nickel mass and plateau luminosity in comparison with those with higher ejecta velocities .",
    "more sample are needed to confirm wether the photometric diversity of sne iip increases at low ejecta velocities .",
    "on the other hand , the variations in the expansion velocities can be in principle related to the composition of the progenitor star , the envelope mass , and even the viewing angles to observe the explosions . at lower metallicity",
    ", the line - forming region will go deeper into the photosphere to have the same line opacity , and thus it results in smaller line velocities @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the progenitor of sn 2013am has lower metallicity compared to sn 2008 in or sn 2009 in considering that they have similar tail luminosities .",
    "moreover , the large envelope mass ejected in the explosion can also lead to smaller line velocity for the sne iip with the same explosion energy . on the other hand , the smaller ejecta velocity seen in sn 2013am might be also due to that it was viewed at an angle away from the polar direction in the explosion .",
    "this can be examined with the polarization observations made during the nebular phase .",
    "6246 or @xmath825169 measured at @xmath121 days after explosion ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) vs. m(@xmath6ni ) .",
    "lower : @xmath122 vs. the @xmath4-band absolute magnitudes measured at @xmath121 days after explosion ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) .",
    "the filled star represents sn 2013am dereddened with @xmath55=3.1 , while the open star represents the case with @xmath2=1.4 .",
    "sne 2005cs , 2012a , and 1999em were plotted by opened signs for better display .",
    "the red lines represent the linear fit to the observed data.,width=302 ]",
    "we present the optical and ultraviolet observations of the low - velocity sn iip 2013am in nearby galaxy m65 .",
    "the spectra of sn 2013am are characterized by narrow p - cygni lines at lower velocities , and the overall evolution is very similar to that seen in the proto - type low - velocity ii - p supernova 2005cs . however , sn 2013am has shorter  plateau \" duration and brighter tail compared to sn 2005cs , and it shows close resemblance to the transition objects like sn 2009n and sn 2008 in .    both photometric and spectroscopic methods suggest that sn 2013am suffered a significant reddening in the host galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath124 mag ) .",
    "after corrections for the extinction using the above reddening and @xmath2=3.1 , we find that sn 2013am has an absolute @xmath4-band magnitude of @xmath125 mag in the middle of the plateau , a @xmath12 bolometric luminosity of @xmath102 erg s@xmath1 ) around the maximum light , and an ejected @xmath6ni mass of @xmath7m@xmath8 .",
    "these values are comparable to those derived for the  gap - filler \" events sn 2009n and sn 2008 in , although the variation in r@xmath65 may cause additional uncertainties in these estimations .",
    "the higher luminosity of sn 2013am , compared with sn 2005cs , is also consistent with the report that sne iip with shorter  plateau \" durations tend to be more luminous @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the velocity - luminosity relation may not hold for all sne iip .",
    "the ejecta velocity may be related to variations in metallicity of the progenitor star , the envelope mass , and even the viewing angles to observe the explosions",
    ". a better understanding of the properties of the progenitors and polarization observations would help make further distinguish between the above factors .",
