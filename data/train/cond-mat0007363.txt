    "as with any material , the transport properties of doped manganites la@xmath5a@xmath6mno@xmath1 ( a is a divalent ion such as ca , sr , ba etc . ) differ markedly whether they are in single - crystalline or polycrystalline form ( see chapters 1 and 5 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "there exists experimental evidence that the presence of grains and grain boundaries ( gb ) modifies drastically the type of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the resistivity @xmath7 in ceramic manganites as compared to single - crystalline samples.@xcite in single crystals ( at @xmath8 ) a strong peak of @xmath9 is observed near the curie temperature @xmath10 - a metal - insulator transition occurs .",
    "in contrast , the resistivity of a polycrystalline samples exhibits a wide maximum at a temperature @xmath11 well below @xmath10 . at sufficiently small grain size",
    "no peak is seen near @xmath12 , but as the grain size increases the peaks at both @xmath13 and @xmath10 become coexistent .",
    "@xcite in good polycrystalline samples the former peak at @xmath13 degenerates to a  shoulder  at @xmath14 and only a sharp maximum of @xmath15 is observed near @xmath10.@xcite the magnetoresistance ( mr ) in the single crystals and polycrystalline samples also behave very differently .",
    "e.g. , the single crystals have colossal mr ( cmr ) in a vicinity of @xmath10 and small enough mr apart it.@xcite on the other hand , the ceramics have an appreciable mr throughout the ferromagnetic region and often manifest the largest mr at low temperatures.@xcite this low - temperature mr is characterized by enhanced low - field response @xmath16.@xcite in addition to such low - field low - temperature mr , the prominent feature that distinguish the polycrystalline from single - crystalline la@xmath5a@xmath6mno@xmath1 is a shallow minimum of @xmath15 , which occurs at a temperature @xmath17 well below @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite    two approaches have been used to explain the phenomena specific for polycrystalline manganites .",
    "intergrain tunneling concept has been applied to model the low- and high - field mr at low @xmath18,@xcite as well as the temperature and grain - size dependencies of the resistivity.@xcite mr at intermediate @xmath18 ( around @xmath19 ) and the low - temperature minimum of @xmath15 have not been examined within this model .",
    "the latter phenomenon , however , has been considered using the second approach , namely , bulk - scattering concept.@xcite it has been suggested that the minimum ( and the resistivity upturn at lower @xmath18 ) arises from the competition of two contributions - one , usual , increasing and other , decreasing with the increase of the temperature .",
    "the origin of such an unusual contribution has been attributed to coulomb interaction ( ci ) between carriers strongly enhanced by disorder.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , no attempt was done to describe within ci model the flattening and vanishing of the minimum under rather small external magnetic fields observed in very different polycrystalline manganites.@xcite    the present paper focuses on the study of the low - temperature minimum of resistivity in ceramic manganites . in section 2",
    "we present the experimental results on the temperature dependence of the resistivity in zero and an increased magnetic field .",
    "the data obtained are analyzed in section 3 using a bulk - scattering model ( * a * ) and a model of carrier tunneling between antiferromagnetically ( afm ) coupled ferromagnetic ( fm ) grains ( * b * ) .",
    "the results of the consideration are concluded in section 4 .",

    "% of dispersed ag were prepared @xcite by a standard ceramic technology .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that ag doping leads to the formation of ag agglomerates within the sample that , in turn , decrease the resultant resistivity of lpmo ( see fig.1 ) but have no pronounced effect on the magnetic and mr properties .",
    "measurements of @xmath20 vs. t at zero magnetic field and at @xmath21 up to @xmath22 tesla were carried out in the temperature range @xmath23 k , and the results obtained are presented in figs . 1 and 2 . .5 cm    = 3truein    [ fig.1 ]     ( a ) temperature dependence of the resistivity of la@xmath0pb@xmath0mno@xmath1 ( curve 1 ) and la@xmath0pb@xmath0mno@xmath1 containing 10 at .",

    "high level la - site doping of the lpmo ceramic do not suppress the above noted wide maximum of @xmath15 as well ( see fig.1 ) .",
    ".5 cm    = 3truein    [ fig.2 ]     experimental temperature dependence of the resistivity of la@xmath0pb@xmath0mno@xmath1 containing 10 at .",
    "% of ag measured at various magnetic fields .5 cm    the measurements of the magnetization @xmath28 vs. @xmath18 at a low @xmath21 were reported previously .",
    "@xcite for the benefit of the present discussion , the low - temperature data are displayed here in an extended scale , see fig .",
    ".5 cm    = 3truein    [ fig.3 ]     magnetization vs. temperature measured at low magnetic field .",
    "the results are presented at temperatures up to 150 k ; the magnetization vs. temperature measured at a wider temperature region is given in the inset .5 cm    the mr and magnetic properties of the lpmo ceramic@xcite are similar to those of other ceramic manganites.@xcite in particular , @xmath19 is significantly lower than @xmath10 , the largest mr effect occurs at lowest @xmath18 , and , except only a small peak near @xmath10 , mr gradually decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "note that the resistivity upturn at @xmath29 could not be attributed to the effect of charge ordering since , similarly to that observed in other ceramic manganites , @xcite it appears to be weak ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "so , the lpmo is an appropriate system for studying effects , which are peculiar for the la - based manganite ceramics .",
    "let us first analyze @xmath24 at low temperatures under an assumption that bulk scattering dominates the conduction .",
    "it seems reasonable in the ceramics with large contacting grains that may form a percolation cluster .",
    "generally , the resistivity can be represented as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the contributions due elastic ( electron - impurity interaction and ci ) and inelastic ( e.g. electron - phonon interaction ) processes .",
    "normally , the part @xmath33 increases with increasing the temperature due to a power law @xmath34 in which the coefficient @xmath35 does nt depend on @xmath21 . in good conductors",
    "the part @xmath36 does nt depend on @xmath18 and @xmath21 being equal to the residual resistivity @xmath37 , but at rather strong disorder both temperature and magnetic - field dependence appears in @xmath38 due to ci and decoherence effects.@xcite    a theory of ci correction to the residual conductivity at @xmath39 was originally developed by altshuler and aronov @xcite , yielding the following expression @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the carriers diffusion constant .",
    "thus , with the use of eq.([cicorr ] ) and assumed form of @xmath33 , eq.([resist ] ) takes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the interplay of the increasing and decreasing temperature - dependent terms in eq.([reswimin ] ) gives rise to the minimum of @xmath15 .",
    "such an explanation was suggested in refs.@xcite it appears that our experimental curves @xmath15 at low temperatures are fitted fairly well by eq.([reswimin ] ) with the same @xmath45 as was taken in refs.@xcite though , this explanation is plausible , it must be verified by an additional evidence . in this connection",
    "the influence of external magnetic field on the minimum is a crucial test for the model .",
    "very recently , the calculation of the total quantum correction to @xmath46 that could shed light on our problem , has been accurately recast by aleiner et al.@xcite it gives @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ci contribution in a non - zero magnetic field , and @xmath49 is the contribution of dephasing caused by both magnetic field and ci .",
    "asymptotic formulas of ref .",
    "@xcite , suitable mostly for 1d and 2d cases , contain the terms divergent in 3d . to get finite results such terms",
    "have been recalculated . for the ci correction",
    "we have @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fermi wave - number , @xmath52 is the mean free path and @xmath53 is the magnetic length . the condition @xmath54 @xmath55 under which the calculation was done@xcite holds for @xmath21 up to tens tesla .",
    "formally eq.([ciresnozh ] ) predicts a reduction of the ci correction but actually this effect is negligibly small . for example , at typical carrier density @xmath56 @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the right - hand side of eq.([ciresnozh ] ) is smaller than @xmath59 up to @xmath60 t. the term @xmath61 has been obtained assuming domination of the magnetic - field contribution to this correction.@xcite the result may be treated as first two terms of expansion of the weak - localization expression @xmath62 with respect to small @xmath63,@xcite where @xmath64 is the length of dephasing due to ci given by @xmath65 the numerical factors in eqs.([cicorr ] ) , ( [ ciresnozh ] ) and ( [ dephasht ] ) stem from the assumed parabolic spectrum and full spin polarization of the carriers .",
    "eq.([dephasht ] ) may serve as a reliable extrapolation of @xmath61 to all @xmath21 .",
    "it follows from eq.([dephasht ] ) that parametrically @xmath55 @xmath66 , and so @xmath67 ( for realistic parameters these inequalities may not hold in the strong form ) .",
    "so , in the considered model at all actual @xmath21 the resistivity minimum persists and is weakly affected by the magnetic field .",
    "it is worth to note that such a resistivity minimum is observed in a single - crystalline bilayered manganite.@xcite at the same time the behavior noted above fully disagrees with the experimental data for ceramic manganites ( see sections 1 and 2 ) .",
    "magnetic - field dependence of @xmath68 leads to a negative mr , but it is too small to account for the observed mr . at @xmath69 @xmath70 and hence , as follows from the above estimation , the model mr in rather strong fields achieves percents at best . in comparison ,",
    "measured mr is @xmath71 at @xmath72 k , and @xmath21 of only @xmath22 t causes the minimum to disappear ( see fig .",
    "thus , the bulk - scattering model with quantum corrections to conductivity predicting a resistivity minimum at zero magnetic field , strongly disagrees with the experiment on ceramic manganites as concerns the behavior of the minimum in finite magnetic fields .",
    "let us treat the problem using an approach , which is quite opposite to that examined previously .",
    "namely , we will assume that in the discussed materials much of the grains are isolated from each other .",
    "in this model the tunneling between grains brings dominating contribution to the conduction .",
    "this is consistent with the low - temperature conductivity weakly dependent on t , but being smaller than the minimal metallic conductivity.@xcite several groups ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) attributed the low - temperature mr to spin - polarized intergrain tunneling .",
    "our purpose is to describe the low - temperature resistivity minimum also using this concept .",
    "regular theory of tunneling conduction through fm metal - non - magnetic insulator - fm metal junction exists only for the planar geometry .",
    "@xcite for the tunneling resistance between two fm grains , say @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we will use phenomenological expression of ref.@xcite @xmath75    here @xmath76 is the angle between the magnetization directions @xmath77 and @xmath78 of the grains @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively ( @xmath79 @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 = @xmath82 is the spin - valve coefficient , @xcite where @xmath83 is the degree of spin polarization of current carriers in each grain @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 being the densities of states for spin - up and spin - down carriers , respectively , and @xmath87 is a factor independent on the magnetization orientations , which can not be determined in phenomenological approach . by analogy with the case of planar - junction tunneling @xcite it has been proposed @xcite to use the expression @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the distance between the grains and @xmath90 is the tunneling barrier height",
    ". though eq.([rfactor ] ) holds only at large @xmath89 and/or @xmath90 , it may be used for qualitative description .",
    "eqs.([tunresis ] ) and ( [ rfactor ] ) define a random resistor network , which has to be solved in order to obtain the sample resistivity .",
    "as it stands , the problem can not be solved unless the statistics of the configurations @xmath91 is defined . at equilibrium the configuration energy @xmath92 and",
    "temperature @xmath18 defines the statistical distribution .",
    "one of the contributions to @xmath92 is the energy of the grain moments ( @xmath93 ) in the magnetic field @xmath94 .",
    "slonczewski@xcite showed that carriers tunneling via the planar junction mediate an exchange interaction between fm electrodes , which proves to become of afm type for sufficiently high barrier .",
    "as in that case we will assume each two grains @xmath95 to be coupled by an afm exchange @xmath96 , with @xmath97 .",
    "so the energy will take the form @xmath98 where a tensor @xmath99 includes both the dipolar and the above exchange interactions . at @xmath100 , @xmath101 a system with the energy given by eq.([cmenergy ] ) will tend to magnetically frustrated state .",
    "thus , to make afm correlation between grains consistent with fm ground state , we have to attribute the moments contributing to @xmath102 ( eq.([rfactor ] ) ) to only a small part of the grains , most probably to gb .",
    "indeed , our magnetization measurements on lpmo show that at lowered temperature the magnetization curve bends only slightly below the expected saturation ( see fig.3 ) .    in the subsequent discussion",
    "a simplified scheme is used . in accordance with refs.@xcite",
    "in which : ( i ) the exact conductance is replaced by an averaged inverse of eq.([rfactor ] ) and ( ii ) the averaging over the spatial and magnetic variables is carried out independently .",
    "this gives for the resistivity @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "due to eq.([rfactor ] ) the factor @xmath105 is not expected to vary essentially at low @xmath18 and @xmath21 ; in this range the field dependence of the resistivity results from that of @xmath106 .",
    "thus , irrespective of the type of frustrated state at @xmath39 , eq.([avresist ] ) describes the cause of the low - field negative mr as being the rotation of the partial grain moments to a unique direction along the magnetic field.@xcite for afm correlation and sufficiently low @xmath21 , @xmath107 increases upon heating from a negative value at the ground state ( note that authors of ref.@xcite estimated @xmath107 from their data to equal @xmath108 ) to higher values .",
    "therefore , the part of eq.([avresist ] ) depending on @xmath109 is a decreasing function of @xmath18 . at @xmath110",
    "such a behavior persists until @xmath106 changes its sign at @xmath111 , while at @xmath112 it becomes an increasing function of @xmath18 . to describe full dependence of @xmath24 the modeling of @xmath105",
    "is required .",
    "zhang et al.@xcite obtained @xmath90 as a function of the magnetization of the grain core and gb . due to this model @xmath105",
    "is an increasing function of temperature at @xmath113.@xcite thus , in view of the above discussion concerning @xmath107 , eq.([avresist ] ) predicts that a minimum of @xmath24 versus temperature should occur at a low @xmath18 and @xmath114 .",
    "this minimum will degrade upon increasing @xmath21 and disappear at @xmath115 , in qualitative agreement with our data shown in fig .",
    "2 , for which @xmath116 t.    the quantitative use of eq.([avresist ] ) is possible only under some approximation to analytical calculation of @xmath107 and @xmath105 ( otherwise , many - body simulation method may be applied directly to the original network , so eq.([avresist ] ) becomes redundant ) . to illustrate the model we approximate @xmath107 by its value for a cluster of two grains with an afm exchange @xmath117 and equal moments @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , since the temperature dependence of the in - grain and gb magnetization is dominated by the spin wave @xmath119 terms at low well @xmath18 , we assume @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the parameters independent on @xmath21 .",
    "the model parameters are then defined from the requirement that in the case @xmath39 eq.([avresist ] ) fits the experimental data for @xmath24 in the range from @xmath123 k to @xmath124 k. in this fit eq.([swprefac ] ) and the expression @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the langevin function , are taken into account .",
    "this gives @xmath127 @xmath128 , @xmath129 @xmath130 k ,",
    "@xmath131 @xmath132 , @xmath133k@xmath134 .",
    "we used these parameters and a closed expression for @xmath107 at @xmath135 @xcite to calculate the model curves @xmath7 at the increased values of the parameter @xmath136 ( see fig.4 ) .",

    "the lines represent theoretical curves based on the model of intergrain tunneling for various s ( normalized field ) .",
    "the open circles are the experimental results observed for la@xmath0pb@xmath0mno@xmath1 : 10 at .",
    ".5 cm    it appears , that in the considered version of the model a quantitative agreement with the experiment can not be achieved with any choice of @xmath137 because of lacking the property of highest magnetic - field response at the lowest fields observed in the experiment .",
    "really , the largest drop of @xmath24 occurs experimentally at @xmath138 t and at higher @xmath21 the change is slower ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the calculated curves demonstrate much more gradual change in low - field region ( see fig.4 ) . nevertheless , the predictions of the model concerning the generic behavior of the resistivity minimum under the increase of @xmath21 are in a well qualitative agreement with the experiment . finally , if we equate the value of @xmath139 at which the minimum disappears in the model to its value at @xmath140 t we retrieve @xmath141",
    ". low values of @xmath83 and @xmath142 may express the fact that really a small part of a grain with reduced magnetic order contributes to the tunneling .",
    "a characteristic shallow minimum of the resistivity was found to occur in various polycrystalline doped manganites la@xmath5a@xmath6mno@xmath1 where a is ca , sr , ba @xcite or pb .",
    "@xcite usually this minimum occurs at low temperatures ( @xmath143 k ) , shifts towards lower @xmath18 upon applying a magnetic field and disappears at some field @xmath4 .",
    "two models were considered to account for this minimum : ( i ) bulk scattering with quantum corrections to conductivity and ( ii ) tunneling between afm coupled grains .",
    "the resistivity minimum in the first model , in disagreement with experiment , is almost insensitive to @xmath21 in the range of interest .",
    "the second model provides a fairly well qualitative description of the effects observed . even in a rough approximation it agrees with experiment .",
    "very recent experimental data also strongly support the suggested nature of the effect considered .",
    "for example , the minimum of @xmath15 and its gradual vanishing under external @xmath21 are observed in a ceramic sample of la@xmath144sr@xmath145mno@xmath1 while no such an effect is detected on a single crystal of the same composition.@xcite the same effect is observed in an epitaxial bicrystal film of la@xmath26ca@xmath27mno@xmath1 with an artificially created single grain boundary , but is absent in an epitaxial film of the same composition.@xcite it also should be noted that the spin - dependent tunneling of charge carriers in ceramic manganites discussed in this paper is similar to that observed earlier in granular ferromagnetic media - see , for example . @xcite",
