    "we consider binary - state dynamics on static , undirected , connected networks in the limit of infinite network size ( i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of nodes in the network )",
    ". for convenience , we call the two possible node states _ susceptible _ and _ infected _ , as is common in disease - spread models . however , our approach also applies to other binary - state dynamics , such as spin systems @xcite , where each node may be in the @xmath13 ( spin - up ) or the @xmath14 ( spin - down ) state .",
    "the networks have degree distribution @xmath15 and are generated by the configuration model @xcite .",
    "dynamics are stochastic , and are defined by infection and recovery probabilities which depend on the degree @xmath0 of a node , and on the current number @xmath1 of infected neighbors of the node . thus @xmath16 is defined as the probability that a @xmath0-degree node that is susceptible at time @xmath17 , with @xmath1 infected neighbors , changes its state to infected by time @xmath18 , where @xmath19 in an infinitesimally small time interval .",
    "similarly , @xmath20 is the probability that a @xmath0-degree infected node with @xmath1 infected neighbor moves to the susceptible state within a time @xmath19",
    ". these general infection and recovery probabilities can describe many dynamical processes on networks .",
    "for example , in the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model of disease spread ( the contact process ) @xcite , each susceptible node may be infected at a rate @xmath2 by each infected neighbor , and each infected node recovers at a constant rate @xmath3 , so the rates @xmath9 and @xmath10 take the form @xmath21 zero - temperature glauber dynamics for a spin system on a network @xcite provide another example . here",
    ", each node has a spin of @xmath13 or @xmath14 ( which we can identify with the infected or susceptible state , respectively ) . in each infinitesimal time step ,",
    "one node is selected at random ( @xmath22 ) and its spin is set to @xmath13 if the local field ( sum of its neighbors spins ) is positive , to @xmath14 is the local field is negative , and to @xmath23 with equal probability if the local field is zero .",
    "thus , the new spin matches the majority of its neighbors spins ( with a random choice in case of a tie ) .",
    "the infection and recovery rates may therefore be expressed as @xmath24 the voter model @xcite has rates given by @xmath25 since infection of a @xmath0-degree node , for example , occurs by copying one of @xmath1 infected neighbors out of @xmath0 possible choices .",
    "we now proceed to derive the master equations for dynamics of this type , closely following the approach used in @xcite for sis dynamics .",
    "let @xmath26 ( resp .",
    "@xmath27 ) be the set of nodes which are susceptible ( resp .",
    "infected ) , have degree @xmath0 , and have @xmath1 infected neighbors . to quantify the size of these sets , define @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 ) as the fraction of @xmath0-degree nodes that are susceptible ( resp .",
    "infected ) at time @xmath17 , and have @xmath1 infected neighbors .",
    "then the fraction @xmath30 of @xmath0-degree nodes that are infected at time @xmath17 is given by @xmath31 and the fraction of infected nodes in the whole network is found by summing over all @xmath0-classes : @xmath32 if a randomly - chosen fraction @xmath33 of nodes are initially infected , then the initial conditions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are easily seen to be @xmath36 where we introduce the convenient notation @xmath37 for the binomial factor @xmath38 .",
    "note that we can also calculate the number of edges of various types using this formalism .",
    "for example , the number of edges in the network which join a susceptible node to an infected node ( we call these _ @xmath39-@xmath40 edges _ for short ) can be expressed in two equivalent ways : @xmath41 the first of these expressions , for example , follows from noting that in a sufficiently large network that there are @xmath42 nodes of degree @xmath0 , of which a fraction @xmath34 are susceptible and have @xmath1 infected neighbors .",
    "each such node contributes @xmath1 edges to the total number of @xmath39-@xmath40 edges .",
    "similar expressions may also be given for the number of @xmath39-@xmath39 and @xmath40-@xmath40 edges in the network .",
    "we note that the equivalence of the two expressions in ( [ star ] ) is preserved by the evolution equations described below .",
    "next , we examine how the size of the @xmath26 set changes in time .",
    "we write the general expression @xmath43 to reflect all the transitions whose rate is linear in @xmath19 ( all other state - transitions are negligible in the @xmath44 limit ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig_schematic ] .",
    "here @xmath45 , for example , is the probability that a node in the @xmath26 set at time @xmath17 moves to the @xmath27 set by time @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear from the definitions above that @xmath46 a node moves from the @xmath47 set to the @xmath26 set if it remains susceptible , while one of its susceptible neighbors becomes infected .",
    "note this means that an @xmath39-@xmath39 edge changes to an @xmath39-@xmath40 edge .",
    "if we suppose that @xmath39-@xmath39 edges change to @xmath39-@xmath40 edges at a ( time - dependent ) rate @xmath48 , we can write is the same for all @xmath39-@xmath39 edges in the network , regardless of their local neighborhood  the same assumption is made for the other rates @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "see also the explanation in @xcite for the sis case . ]",
    "@xmath52 since nodes in the @xmath26 set have @xmath53 susceptible neighbors , while those in the @xmath47 set have @xmath54 susceptible neighbors . to calculate @xmath48",
    ", we count the number of @xmath39-@xmath39 edges in the network at time @xmath17 , and then count the number of edges which switch from being @xmath39-@xmath39 edges to @xmath39-@xmath40 edges in the time interval @xmath19 ; the probability @xmath55 is given by taking the ratio of the latter to the former , i.e. @xmath56 a similar approximation is used to define @xmath49 , the rate at which @xmath39-@xmath40 edges change to @xmath39-@xmath39 edges due to the recovery of an infected node : @xmath57 and we then write @xmath58 taking the limit @xmath59 of equation ( [ weqn ] ) gives the master equation for the evolution of @xmath28 ( see fig .  [ fig_schematic ] ) : @xmath60 where @xmath1 is in the range @xmath61 for each @xmath0-class in the network ( and adopting the convention @xmath62 . applying identical arguments , _ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", to the set @xmath27 , we derive the corresponding system of equations for @xmath29 : @xmath63 for @xmath64 and for each @xmath0-class in the network , with time - dependent rates @xmath50 and @xmath51 defined though @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath65 the master equations ( [ seqnsapp ] ) and ( [ ieqnsapp ] ) , with the time - dependent rates @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( defined as nonlinear functions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , form a closed system of deterministic equations which , along with initial conditions ( [ ics ] ) , can be solved numerically using standard methods .",
    "note that the evolution equations are completely prescribed by the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and so this method can be applied to any stochastic dynamical process defined by transition rates @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for the sis model , equations ( [ seqnsapp ] ) and ( [ ieqnsapp ] ) were derived in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , with additional terms to study adaptive rewiring of the network .",
    "the pair approximation ( [ pa ] ) derived in the main text is of the type dubbed `` heterogeneous pa '' in @xcite , because the system includes variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 for each degree class @xmath0 .",
    "a more parsimonious set of equations may be derived under the assumptions of `` homogeneous pa '' , wherein the @xmath0-dependence of edge - based variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 is neglected . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the reduction in the number of variables typically comes at the cost of reduced accuracy .    for homogeneous pa , the parameter @xmath68 ( resp .",
    "@xmath69 ) is defined as the probability that a randomly - chosen neighbor of a susceptible ( resp .",
    "infected ) node is infected . noting that @xmath68 can be expressed in terms of @xmath34 as @xmath70 an evolution equation for @xmath71 may be derived by multiplying equation ( [ seqnsapp ] ) by @xmath72 and summing over @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the right - hand - side of the resulting equation contains higher moments of @xmath34 , so a closure approximation is needed to proceed . if , similar to the steps yielding equations ( [ pa ] ) , we here make the ansatz that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are proportional to binomial distributions : @xmath73 then an equation for @xmath74 may be found in terms of only @xmath75 , @xmath71 , and @xmath76 .",
    "applying the same ansatz to expression ( [ star ] ) gives the algebraic relation @xmath77 between @xmath71 and @xmath76 , where @xmath78 can be interpreted as the probability that the node at one end of a randomly - chosen edge is infected .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain the _ homogeneous pair approximation _ , consisting of the @xmath79 differential equations : @xmath80 along with the algebraic relation ( [ algebraic ] ) , and initial conditions @xmath81 .    for the sis model ,",
    "the homogeneous pa equations ( [ hompa ] ) are identical to those recently derived by house and keeling @xcite , while for the voter model equations ( [ hompa ] ) are equivalent to those in @xcite ( in the @xmath82 limit ) .",
    "note that on @xmath83-regular graphs , the heterogeneous and homogeneous pair approximations are identical .",
