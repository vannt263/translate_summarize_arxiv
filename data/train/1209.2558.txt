    "it is expected to be reduced , since the experiment is in progress at the national physics laboratory  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the theoretical error is mainly from the proton charge radius .",
    "if the inconsistency between the values of the electron  proton scattering and the muon hydrogen will be resolved , the uncertainty in the latter result is smaller by one order of magnitude than that of the former , and the theoretical error associated to the proton radius will decrease greatly . the sub - leading contribution to the theoretical error is from the two - photon correction to the sm prediction .",
    "since this is of @xmath122 , the constraint from the transition frequency can be comparable to that of the electron @xmath0 in future .",
    "the hidden photon model is one of the simplest models which can explain the muon @xmath0 anomaly . in this paper , we have examined the constraints on the hidden photon model from the electron @xmath0 as well as from the precise measurements of atomic parameters .",
    "we have shown that the new constraint from the electron @xmath0 is more than one order of magnitude stronger than the previous analysis . the parameter space which can explain the muon @xmath0 anomaly becomes narrow , @xmath147100 mev and @xmath148@xmath149 .",
    "interestingly , this region can be covered by experiments in future  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the electron @xmath0 is based on a precise measurement of the fine structure constant , which is determined independently of the @xmath0 .",
    "we have also discussed the effect of the hidden photon on the determination of the fine structure constant .",
    "we have shown that , although the determination of the fine structure constant is affected by the hidden photon , its contribution to the electron @xmath0 is small compared with the direct loop contribution to the @xmath0 .",
    "we have also investigated a constraint on the hidden photon model from the precise measurements of hydrogen transition frequencies .",
    "since the atomic energy levels are affected by the hidden photon , the precisely measured transition frequencies can be used to constrain the hidden photon model .",
    "a careful analysis is essential , since the determination of the various quantities , such as the rydberg constant or transition frequencies , are often correlated .",
    "we have shown that , by taking a ratio of transition frequencies , the measurement becomes free from the uncertainty of the rydberg constant , and a severe constraint is obtained .",
    "the constraint on the hidden photon model is now about one order of magnitude weaker than the electron @xmath0 , but more precise measurements of the transition frequencies can improve the constraint , which may compete with the @xmath0 constraint .",
    "while completing this paper , we noticed that the version 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite was posted on arxiv , which also updated the bound on the hidden photon model from the electron @xmath0 .",
