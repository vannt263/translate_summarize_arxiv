    "the experimental discovery of persistent currents in mesoscopic rings pierced by a magnetic flux,@xmath5 earlier proposed theoretically,@xmath6 has revealed interesting new effects .",
    "the currents measured in metallic and semiconducting rings , either in a single ring or an array of many rings , generally exhibit an unexpectedly large amplitude , i.e. , larger by at least one order of magnitude , than predicted by theoretical studies of electron models with either disorder or electron - electron interaction treated perturbatively.@xmath7 it has been suggested that the interactions and their interplay with disorder are possibly responsible for the large currents observed , expecting that the effect of the interactions could counteract the disorder effect . however , no consensus has yet been reached on the role of the interactions . in order to gain theoretical insight , it is desirable to perform numerical calculations which allow to consider both interactions and disorder directly in systems with sizes varying from small to large .",
    "analytical calculations usually involve approximations which mainly provide the leading behavior of the properties for large system sizes .",
    "persistent currents in mesoscopic rings strongly depend on the system size , since they emerge from the coherence of the electrons across the entire system .",
    "hence , it is most important to study the size dependence of the current beyond leading order in microscopic models , for a complete understanding of the experimental results .",
    "exact diagonalization was used to calculate persistent currents in systems with very few lattice sites.@xmath8 in this work , we use the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm,@xmath9 to study a simplified model incorporating interactions and a single impurity , accounting for disorder , in larger system sizes .",
    "we consider a system of interacting spinless electrons on a one - dimensional ring , with a single impurity , and penetrated by a magnetic field .",
    "we study an intermediate range of system sizes , where analytical results obtained by bosonization techniques for large system sizes , do not yet fully apply . without impurity , and at half - filling , the system undergoes a metal - insulator transition from a luttinger liquid ( ll)@xmath10 to a charge density wave ( cdw)@xmath11 groundstate .",
    "the persistent current of the interacting system with an impurity was studied before with the dmrg , in the ll phase.@xmath12 here we study the persistent current , and also the drude weight characterizing the conducting properties of the system , in both the ll and the cdw phase , investigating the interplay between the impurity and the interactions in the two phases . in mesoscopic systems",
    "the separation between metallic and insulating behavior is not always obvious , since  the localization length can be of the order or significantly larger than the system size .",
    "hence , a finite drude weight and a current can be observed in the cdw phase of a mesoscopic system .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to characterize the persistent current and the drude weight in both the ll and the cdw phases of mesoscopic systems .",
    "although the simple model that we consider is not the most appropriate to describe the experimental situation , we hope to obtain useful information for the understanding of the more realistic systems . under a jordan - wigner transformation,@xmath13",
    "the system considered is equivalent to a spin-1/2 xxz chain with a weakened exchange coupling .",
    "hence , our results also provide insight into the spin transport in this type of systems .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a system of spinless fermions on a ring pierced by a magnetic flux , with repulsive interactions and a single hopping impurity , or defect , is given by , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hopping term , @xmath16 contains the magnetic flux @xmath17 in units of the flux quantum @xmath18 , @xmath2 measures the strength of the defect with values between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 corresponding to the defectless case ) , and @xmath22 is the interaction term , with @xmath23 representing the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the spinless fermion operators acting on the site @xmath27 of the ring .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath3 sites , with @xmath3 even , and at half - filling , when @xmath28 particles are present .",
    "the lattice constant is set to one and periodic boundary conditions , @xmath29 , are used .    via the gauge transformation @xmath30",
    ", the flux can be removed from the hamiltonian , but in the impurity term where the flux is trapped , and the quantum phase @xmath31 is encoded in a twisted boundary condition @xmath32 .",
    "it is then clear that the energy is periodic in @xmath31 with period @xmath33 , i.e. , it is periodic in the flux @xmath17 threading the ring with period @xmath34.@xmath35    after a jordan - wigner transformation , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be rewritten , respectively , as @xmath36 and @xmath37with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and the boundary conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the model ( 1 ) of spinless fermions is equivalent to a spin-1/2 xxz chain with a weakened exchange coupling , and twisted boundary conditions in the transverse direction .",
    "the half - filled case corresponds to total spin projection @xmath42 .",
    "the persistent current generated on a ring pierced by a magnetic flux , at temperature @xmath43 , can be obtained from the ground state energy @xmath44 , by taking the derivative with respect to @xmath45 , @xmath46    for the spinless fermion system , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , @xmath47 corresponds to the ground state value of the charge current operator @xmath48 , while for the xxz chain , eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , it corresponds to the ground state value of the spin current operator @xmath49 . as a consequence of the periodicity of the energy ,",
    "the current is also periodic in @xmath31 , with period @xmath33 .",
    "hence , it can be expressed as a fourier series ,    @xmath50    and the behavior of the current can be analyzed in terms of the coefficients @xmath51.@xmath12    in the noninteracting case ( @xmath52 ) , it has been found that for large system sizes , the current is invariant under the defect transformation @xmath1,@xmath53 i.e. ,    @xmath54    we shall investigate the existence of this kind of invariance in the interacting case ( @xmath23 ) , both in the ll and the cdw phases .",
    "the drude weight was proposed by kohn as a relevant quantity to distinguish between a metal and an insulator.@xmath55 it is defined as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the location of the minimum of @xmath58 , which depends on the parity of the number of electrons , i.e. , @xmath59 or @xmath60 for , respectively , an odd or an even number of electrons . for the spinless fermion system @xmath61 represents the charge - stiffness and measures the inverse of the effective mass of the charge carriers.@xmath62 in a metallic conductor @xmath61 tends to a finite value whereas in an insulator @xmath61 vanishes with the system size @xmath3 , when @xmath4 . in the insulating state",
    "the drude weight decays as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 measures the localization length .",
    "for the xxz chain the drude weight represents the spin - stiffness .    in a model of free fermions ( @xmath52 ) with no impurity ( @xmath21 ) , it is straightforward to see that the leading behavior of the persistent current @xmath47 in the system size @xmath3 , has a saw - tooth like shape with slope @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the fermi velocity . thus , the amplitude of the current scales with @xmath67 , vanishing in the limit @xmath68 .",
    "the discontinuity in @xmath47 , that results from a degeneracy of energy levels associated to the translation symmetry,@xmath69 appears at @xmath70 or @xmath60 for , respectively , an even or an odd number of electrons . in the presence of an impurity ( @xmath71 ) , bosonization@xmath72 and conformal field theory@xmath73 calculations predict that the shape of the current @xmath47 is rounded off , and its amplitude decreases with increasing strength of the scatterer potential , still vanishing with the system size as @xmath67 .",
    "the impurity lifts the degeneracy of the energy levels and the current then varies continuously.@xmath69    the model with interactions ( @xmath74 ) and without defect ( @xmath21 ) , is solvable by the bethe ansatz for periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath70)@xmath75 and also for twisted boundary conditions ( @xmath76).@xmath77 at half - filling , the system exhibits a metal - insulator transition , which occurs at @xmath78 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the system is in a gapless ll phase , while for @xmath80 it is in a gapped cdw state.@xmath81 the ll phase is characterized by a power - law decay of the correlations .",
    "bosonization predicts that in an homogeneous ll , the leading behavior of the persistent current in the system size @xmath3 , has a saw tooth like shape with slope @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the velocity of current excitations.@xmath84 since translation invariance is preserved in the presence of interactions , the discontinuity in the current still exists for finite @xmath0.@xmath69 a bethe ansatz calculation shows that the drude weight of an homogeneous ll in the thermodynamic limit , has a finite value , which decreases with increasing strength of the interaction @xmath85.@xmath62 the ll state is strongly affected by the presence of an impurity,@xmath86 and bosonization yields that the current then vanishes as @xmath87 , with @xmath88.@xmath72 the study of the ll phase with @xmath71 , performed with the dmrg,@xmath12 has in fact found this kind of behavior .",
    "the cdw phase is characterized by a localization length @xmath64 , which is associated to the energy gap . from the work of baxter,@xmath89 the drude weight in the gapped phase ,",
    "is expected to behave as @xmath63 , vanishing for an infinite system size .",
    "this behavior implies that although the system is insulating in the infinite system size limit , for a finite system , provided @xmath90 is not too large , @xmath61 is still finite and a current can be observed .",
    "the localization length can then be extracted from the size dependence of the drude weight .",
    "we use the dmrg to numerically calculate the groundstate energy of the spinless fermion system as a function of the magnetic flux , @xmath58 , for fixed interaction @xmath0 and impurity strength @xmath2 , in rings up to @xmath91 sites , keeping up to @xmath92 density matrix eigenstates per block.@xmath93 the dmrg is applied to the hamiltonian ( 1 ) after performing the gauge transformation , which removes the flux into a twisted boundary condition.@xmath94 the states of the system are characterized by the quantum numbers associated to the eigenvalues of the local occupation number @xmath95 and the total number of particles @xmath96 operators , which commute with the hamiltonian ( 1).@xmath97 for each set of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 , we obtained the groundstate energy @xmath98 for @xmath99 values of @xmath31 in the periodicity interval @xmath100 , and using chebyshev interpolation@xmath101 we determined the corresponding current ( 6 ) and drude weight ( 9 ) , by numerical differentiation .",
    "we developed a dmrg algorithm for complex hamiltonian matrices , which allowed to calculate the detailed form of the persistent current @xmath102 as a function of @xmath31,@xmath12 and to obtain the drude weight . in a previous approach",
    "the dmrg was used to calculate the so called phase sensitivity @xmath103 , which is the difference of the groundstate energy at flux @xmath70 and @xmath60 , and can be considered a crude measure of the persistent current.@xmath104 although the calculation of @xmath103 requires considerably less computational effort than the calculation of @xmath105 , because then the hamiltonian matrix is real , the phase sensitivity does not provide information on the shape of the current and the value of the drude weight .",
    "we now present the results obtained for the persistent current and the drude weight , where we take @xmath106 and the interaction @xmath0 is in units of @xmath107 .",
    "1 and 2 , exhibit @xmath108 plotted versus @xmath31 , for respectively , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which correspond , respectively , to the ll and the cdw phase , considering different impurity strengths @xmath2 , on a fixed system size @xmath111 .",
    "we can see that the effect of the impurities , in both phases , is to reduce the intensity of the current , and to round off the shape of @xmath47 .",
    "the amplitude of the current decreases rapidly with increasing values of @xmath112 , and also with increasing strength of the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "3 shows that the invariance of the current with respect to the defect , described in eq .",
    "( 8) , found for large system sizes in the noninteracting case , is also observed for the interacting case , both in the ll and in the cdw phases , the system size @xmath3 required to reach the invariance being larger for larger interaction @xmath0 .",
    "4 displays the drude weights associated to the systems with different interactions @xmath0 and impurities @xmath2 , fixed @xmath111 , of the currents presented in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "as one would expect the drude weight decreases with increasing @xmath112 , and also increasing @xmath0 . figs . 5 and 6 , present @xmath108 plotted for several system sizes @xmath3 , respectively , for @xmath109 , in the ll phase , and @xmath110 , in the cdw phase , with @xmath2 fixed at @xmath113 .",
    "we observe that the current vanishes faster than @xmath67 in both phases , exhibiting a different behavior in each phase , @xmath47 vanishing much faster with @xmath3 in the cdw than in the ll phase . in order to analyze the behavior of the current in more detail we have numerically evaluated the coefficients @xmath51 ( for @xmath114 ) of the fourier expansion ( 7 ) .",
    "the first ( @xmath115 ) and the second ( @xmath116 ) fourier coefficients of the current , for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are shown in fig .",
    "one can clearly see that the coefficients @xmath117 and @xmath118 behave similar to each other in both phases .",
    "however , their behavior in the ll and cdw phase is distinct . in the ll phase ,",
    "the fourier coefficients show a power - law decay with @xmath3 , with the second order coefficient decaying faster , i.e. , with a larger exponent , than the first one . in the cdw phase , the fourier coefficients show a dominant exponential decay with @xmath3 , with the second order coefficient also decaying faster , i.e. , with a smaller localization length , than the first one .",
    "we observe that for longer rings , stronger interactions and also stronger impurities , the current is increasingly more precisely described by its first fourier component . in the ll phase",
    ", this in fact corresponds to the asymptotic behavior predicted by bosonization in the large @xmath3  limit , that is @xmath119 .",
    "however , for the system sizes considered here this asymptotic regime is not reached and the current displays a more complex behavior .",
    "the current is composed of a few fourier components with decreasing weight .",
    "8 presents the first fourier coefficient of the current for different values of the interaction , @xmath109 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , fixed @xmath122 , from which we extract the dependence of @xmath117 on @xmath3 , in the intermediate range of sizes considered .",
    "we observe that for @xmath109 , in the ll phase , the first coefficient of the current varies as @xmath123 @xmath124 , with @xmath125 , while for @xmath126 and @xmath110 , in the cdw phase , it varies as @xmath127 , respectively , with @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "the exponent @xmath132 is given by the slope of the straight line in fig .",
    "8.a , and the length @xmath133 and the exponent @xmath134 were carefully adjusted in order to obtain the best collapse of the data in fig.8.b , on a plot of @xmath135 vs @xmath136 .",
    "the drude weights characterizing the systems with different interactions @xmath0 , fixed @xmath122 , are presented in fig",
    "10 clearly shows that the results obtained for the drude weight confirm the conducting behavior shown by the first coefficient of the currents in fig.8 .",
    "we observe that , for @xmath109 the drude weight varies with the system size as @xmath137 , with @xmath138 , while for @xmath126 and @xmath110 it varies as @xmath139 , respectively , with @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "the exponent @xmath144 is given by the slope of the straight line in fig .",
    "10.a , and the localization length @xmath64 and the exponent @xmath145 were carefully adjusted in order to obtain the best collapse of the data in fig.10.b , on a plot of @xmath146 vs @xmath90 .",
    "the exponents and localization lengths characterizing the drude weight are a little different from those characterizing the first fourier component of the current , as one would expect , since the drude weight contains the contribution from the various fourier components .",
    "one sees that the localization length @xmath64 and the exponent @xmath145 decrease with increasing strength of the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "also , concerning the impurity influence , fig .",
    "4 implies that the exponent @xmath144 in the ll phase increases , and the localization length @xmath64 in the cdw phase decreases , with increasing @xmath147 .",
    "as mentioned , in the large @xmath3 limit the current is expected to behave as its first fourier component , which in the ll phase implies that the exponent @xmath132 should be identified with @xmath148 as calculated from bosonization,@xmath72 where @xmath149 is the ll parameter , calculable from the bethe ansatz.@xmath150 for @xmath109 this leads to @xmath151 , which is much larger than our value of @xmath132 .",
    "we should note that the size dependence found for the first fourier component of the current , and the drude weight , characterizes the behavior of an intermediate and limited range of system sizes .",
    "if one would consider a larger range of systems , in the ll phase , one would most probably see the data for the larger @xmath3 bending down , crossing to an asymptotic power - law behaviour with the exponent approaching @xmath152 .",
    "this was observed in ref .",
    "@xmath153 , where the behavior of the first few fourier components of the current in the ll phase was discussed in detail , with data taken for larger values of @xmath3 and stronger interaction and impurity strengths . also , in the cdw phase we consider systems in an intermediate regime where the localization length is larger or near the system size.@xmath154 for larger systems , the power factors that occur in the first fourier component of the current and the drude weight may decline,@xmath155 possibly leaving a pure exponential behavior in the asymptotic regime .    from the results obtained , we observe that the system with @xmath109 and @xmath122 , is characterized by an exponent @xmath156 , which is generated by the interplay of the electron interaction with the impurity , and @xmath61 exhibits then a power - law decay with @xmath3 , which implies vanishing in the limit @xmath4 . on the other hand , the systems with @xmath126 and @xmath110 , fixed @xmath122 ,",
    "are characterized by a localization length @xmath64 , which decreases with increasing interaction and impurity strength , and @xmath61 exhibits now an exponential decay with @xmath3 , also vanishing as @xmath4 .",
    "hence , we find that both in the ll and the cdw phases , with an impurity in the system , the effect of the interaction is to decrease the current and the drude weight . as referred before , our results also provide insight into the spin transport in a spin-1/2 xxz chain with a weak link , and a similar behavior to the one above is implied for the spin current and stiffness .",
    "so , in the gapless xy phase , the spin stiffness decays with a power - law , vanishing in the limit @xmath4 , while in the gapped ising phase , it decays exponentially , also vanishing as @xmath4 . comparing our results for the persistent current in the ll phase , with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xmath153 , we have similarly found that the current vanishes faster than @xmath67 .",
    "one observes that the model parameters strongly influence when the last asymptotic regime described by bosonization is reached .",
    "a calculation of the finite - size corrections to the spin stiffness in a pure spin-1/2 xxz chain,@xmath157 has revealed a size dependence in the gapped phase that has a similar form to the one found here .",
    "the result that the drude weight in a ring in the gapless phase with an impurity drops to zero , is in agreement with a previous result obtained for a spin chain,@xmath158 and with renormalization group arguments , which state that the impurity term is relevant leading to a transmission cut.@xmath159 the renormalization group studies find that either a weak barrier or a weak link lead to an insulating state for repulsive interactions , while in the noninteracting case those are marginal perturbations . in turn",
    ", our work shows that there is an invariance of the current under the defect transformation @xmath160 in the interacting system , as for the noninteracting system , and that implies that a strong link will also reduce the current and the drude weight .",
    "the observation that with an impurity in the system , the interaction always leads to an additional decrease of the current and the drude weight is in agreement with previous results by other authors,@xmath8 and can be understood as it is more difficult to move correlated electrons in a scattering potential than independent electrons .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the persistent current and the drude weight on a mesoscopic ring pierced by a magnetic flux . we considered a model of spinless fermions with repulsive interactions and a hopping impurity ,",
    "which is also equivalent to a  spin-1/2 xxz chain with a weakened exchange coupling . using a powerful numerical method , the dmrg with complex fields , we have calculated the detailed form of the current as a function of the magnetic flux , which enabled us to investigate the corrections to the large system - size limit , and also allowed to obtain the drude weight .",
    "we show that the system at half - filling , changes from an algebraic to an exponential behavior as the interaction increases , corresponding to a change from a ll to a cdw phase .",
    "we find that the analytical predictions of bosonization for the ll phase , are not yet fully observed in the intermediate range of system sizes considered .",
    "in addition we observe that the invariance of the current under the defect transformation @xmath160 , seen in the noninteracting system , is also verified in the interacting system , in both phases .",
    "hence , an isolated strong link is not only useless for increasing the persistent current ( as might have been expected ) , but it rather destroys coherence and reduces the current .",
    "the behavior determined for the current is consistent with the behaviour determined for the drude weight , the ll phase being characterized by an exponent @xmath156 , which results from the interplay of the interactions with the impurity , while the cdw phase is characterized by a localization length @xmath64 , which decreases with increasing interaction and impurity strength .",
    "we find that , both in the ll and the cdw phase , with a defect in the system the interactions always suppress the current , and the drude weight drops to zero in the limit @xmath4 . away from half - filling",
    "there is no metal - insulator transition in the pure case , and the system is always metallic .",
    "hence , one does not expect to observe then a change in the current and the drude weight from an algebraic to an exponential decay .",
    "nevertheless , one still expects to observe that in the system with an impurity , the current and the drude weight decrease with increasing impurity and interaction strengthes .",
    "therefore , within the model considered , the interactions can not explain the results observed in the experiments .",
    "@xmath81 in the xxz  chain , a transition occurrs at @xmath176 , from an xy model , for @xmath177 , to an ising model , for @xmath178 , @xmath176 corresponding to the heisenberg model .",
