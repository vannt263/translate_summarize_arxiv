    "a well - known long standing problem in combinatorics and statistical mechanics is to find the generating function for self - avoiding polygons ( or walks ) on a two - dimensional lattice , enumerated by perimeter .",
    "recently , we have gained a greater understanding of the difficulty of this problem , as rechnitzer @xcite has _ proved _ that the ( anisotropic ) generating function for square lattice self - avoiding polygons is not differentiably finite @xcite , as had been previously _ conjectured _ , on numerical grounds @xcite , but not proved . that is to say , it can not be expressed as the solution of an ordinary differential equation with polynomial coefficients .",
    "there are many simplifications of this problem that are solvable @xcite , but all the simpler models impose an effective directedness or other constraint that reduces the problem , in essence , to a one - dimensional problem .",
    "one model , that of so - called _ three - choice polygons _ , has remained unsolved despite the knowledge that its solution must be d - finite . in this paper",
    "we report on recent numerical work resulting in an exact differential equation apparently satisfied by the perimeter generating function of three - choice polygons . while our results do not constitute a rigorous mathematical proof the numerical evidence is compelling .",
    "three - choice self - avoiding walks on the square lattice , @xmath0 , were introduced by manna @xcite and can be defined as follows : starting from the origin one can step in any direction ; after a step upward or downward one can head in any direction ( except backward ) ; after a step to the left one can only step forward or head downward , and similarly after a step to the right one can continue forward or turn upward .",
    "alternatively put , one can not make a right - hand turn after a horizontal step .",
    "whittington @xcite showed that the growth constant for three - choice walks is exactly 2 , so that if @xmath1 denotes the number of such walks of @xmath2 steps on an infinite lattice , equivalent up to a translation , then @xmath3 it is perhaps surprising that the best known result for the sub - dominant term is @xmath4 but attempts to improve on this have not been successful . even numerically , there is no firmly based conjecture for the sub - dominant term , unlike for ordinary self - avoiding walks , for which the sub - dominant term is widely believed to be @xmath5    as usual one can define a polygon version of the walk model by requiring the walk to return to the origin .",
    "so a three - choice polygon @xcite is simply a three - choice self - avoiding walk which returns to the origin , but has no other self - intersections .",
    "there are two distinct classes of three - choice polygons .",
    "the three - choice rule either leads to staircase polygons or _",
    "imperfect staircase polygons _ @xcite",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : poly ] . in the case of staircase polygons",
    "any vertex on the perimeter can act as the origin of the three - choice walk ( which then proceeds counter - clockwise ) , while for imperfect staircase polygons there is only one possible origin but the polygon could be rotated by 180 degrees . if we denote by @xmath6 the number of three - choice polygons with perimeter @xmath7 then , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of staircase polygons with perimeter @xmath7 , and @xmath10 is the number of imperfect staircase polygons of perimeter @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath6 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 all grow like @xmath11 and in particular we recall the well - known result that @xmath12 are given by the catalan numbers @xmath13 .",
    "examples of the two types of three - choice polygons . in the right panel",
    "we indicate the origin ( @xmath14 ) and the direction of the first step ( note that rotation by 180 degrees also leads to a valid three - choice polygon ) . ]    in this paper we report on recent work which has led to an exact fuchsian @xcite linear differential equation of order 8 apparently satisfied by the perimeter generating function , @xmath15 , for three - choice polygons ( that is @xmath16 is conjectured to be one of the solutions of the ode , expanded around the origin ) .",
    "the first few terms in the generating function are @xmath17 the generating function for the coefficients @xmath10 is no simpler .    if we distinguish between steps in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 direction , and let @xmath20 denote the number of three - choice polygons with @xmath21 horizontal steps and @xmath7 vertical steps , then the anisotropic generating function for @xmath22 can be written @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ( rational @xcite ) generating function for three - choice polygons with @xmath7 vertical steps . in earlier , unpublished , numerical work , we found that , for imperfect staircase polygons , the denominators were : @xmath25 and @xmath26 this was subsequently proved by bousquet - mlou @xcite .",
    "further , bousquet - mlou showed that the numerators satisfied : @xmath27 and @xmath28 unfortunately , we still do not have enough information to identify the numerators , though we observe that they are of degree @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath2 even , and of degree @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath2 odd .",
    "it is also possible to express the generating function @xmath16 as a five - fold sum , with one constraint , @xcite of @xmath33 gessel - viennot determinants @xcite .",
    "this is clear from figure [ fig : gv ] , where the enumeration of the lattice paths between the dotted lines is just the classical problem of 4 non - intersecting walkers , and these must be joined to two non - intersecting walkers to the left , and to two non - intersecting walkers to the right",
    ". then one must sum over different possible geometries .",
    "however the fact that the generating function is so expressible implies that it is differentiably finite @xcite .     showing the decomposition of an imperfect staircase polygon into a sequence of 2 - 4 - 2 non - intersecting walkers , each expressible as a gessel - viennot determinant ]    in the following sections we report on our work leading to an ode for the perimeter generating function of three - choice polygons .",
    "we started by generating the counts for three - choice polygons up to half - perimeter 260 . using numerical experimentation",
    "we then found what we believe to be the underlying ode .",
    "this calculation required the use of the first 206 coefficients with the resulting ode then correctly predicting the next 54 coefficients .",
    "while the possibility that this ode is not the correct one is extraordinarily small , our result does of course not constitute a proof .",
    "unfortunately we can not usefully bound the size of the underlying ode , otherwise we could use the knowledge of d - finiteness to provide a proof of our results .",
    "that is to say , any bounds that follow from closure theorems @xcite are too large to be useful .",
    "the algorithm we use to count the number of imperfect polygons is a slightly modified version of the algorithm of conway _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . before proceeding to the full problem it is useful to briefly outline the transfer matrix algorithm for enumerating staircase polygons . recall that a staircase polygon consists of two directed walks starting at the origin , moving only to the right and up , and terminating once the walks join at a vertex .",
    "if we look at a diagonal line @xmath34 then for any integer @xmath35 this line will intersect a polygon at 0 ( miss the polygon ) or 2 edges ( intersect the polygon ) , see figure  [ fig : poly ] .",
    "we start with @xmath36 such that the line intersects the first two edges of the staircase polygon .",
    "we then move the line upward ( increase @xmath35 by 1 ) and as we do this we add an edge to each walk .",
    "there are only four new configurations corresponding to the four possible steps .",
    "we need only keep track of the gap between the two walks , where the gap is the minimal number of iterations required in order to join the two walks . as we move the line",
    "the gap is either increased by a unit ( the upper walk moves up and the lower walk moves right ) , decreased by a unit ( the upper walk moves right and the lower walk moves up ) or remains constant in two possible ways ( both walks move up or right ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be the number of configurations with a gap of @xmath38 at step @xmath35 .",
    "we then have the following very simple algorithm :    set @xmath39 ( where @xmath18 is a variable conjugate to the half - perimeter of the polygon ) .",
    "run through all possible gaps @xmath40 and do the following updates : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is short - hand for assign to @xmath45 the value @xmath46 .",
    "formally we can view the transformation from the set of states @xmath37 to @xmath47 as a matrix multiplication ( hence our use of the nomenclature _ transfer matrix algorithm _ ) with @xmath35 counting the number of iterations of the transfer matrix algorithm .",
    "however , as can be readily seen from the algorithm the transfer matrix is extremely sparse and there is no reason to list it explicitly ( it is given _",
    "implicitly _ by the updating rules ) .    the term @xmath48 is the number of staircase polygons of half - perimeter @xmath49 .",
    "note that the use of the variable @xmath18 is somewhat superfluous in the case of staircase polygons since the generating function at iteration @xmath35 is just @xmath50 , where @xmath37 is the number of configuration with gap @xmath38 after @xmath35 iterations .",
    "but it is included here for reasons of generality and in the case of imperfect staircase polygons the generating function will be a ( non - trivial ) polynomial in @xmath18 .",
    "naturally we need not actually keep all the entries @xmath37 since only the current and subsequent values are needed for the calculation so we can replace @xmath37 with @xmath51 .",
    "we just have to initially set to zero all entries in the next step and keep a running total @xmath52 of the number of staircase polygons .",
    "imperfect staircase polygons start out as ordinary staircase polygons ( see figure  [ fig : gv ] ) then at some vertex two additional directed walks ( sharing the same starting point ) are inserted between the two original walks ( at the first dashed line marked with a ` 4 ' in figure  [ fig : gv ] ) .",
    "the diagonal line will thus intersect these polygon configurations at four edges .",
    "imperfect staircase polygons are created by connecting the first two walks and the last two walks ( as illustrated at the last dashed line marked with a ` 4 ' in figure  [ fig : gv ] ) . with four walks",
    "we need to retain three pieces of information , namely , the three gaps @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath2 between consecutive walks .",
    "each existing configuration can produce 16 new configurations as each walk is extended by a step either up or to the right .",
    "the resulting updating is easily worked out @xcite .",
    "let @xmath55 be the generating function ( a polynomial in the variable @xmath18 ) for partially completed polygons at a given diagonal @xmath35 .",
    "as we proceed to the next diagonal @xmath49 we add @xmath56 ( the factor @xmath57 arise because we extend all walks by a step ) to @xmath55 ( twice ) , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "any update resulting in @xmath72 has to be rejected because it corresponds to a configuration in which we have joined the two middle walks in and this can never lead to an imperfect staircase polygon .",
    "obviously once any two walks have been connected the remaining walks follow the usual staircase polygon updating rules .",
    "the configurations with two walks already connected can also be encoded by the @xmath73 functions .",
    "we simply let @xmath74 be the generating function for partial polygons with two walks already connected ( note that if the boundary line intersects four edges @xmath75 ) .",
    "so in the updating of imperfect staircase polygons we can set @xmath76 ( we connect the two lower - most walks ) to @xmath77 ( this case is illustrated at the last dashed line marked with a ` 4 ' in figure  [ fig : gv ] ) .",
    "likewise we can set @xmath78 ( we connect the two uppermost walks ) to @xmath74 .",
    "the condition for the formation of a valid polygon is @xmath79 ( note that we ca nt demand @xmath80 as well , since we could connect _ both _ the lower- and uppermost walks simultaneously ) .",
    "the ` creation ' of a configuration with three gaps , alternatively , one in which a diagonal line intersects four edges of an imperfect staircase polygon , which we refer to as a @xmath73-type configuration , is also very simple ( see the first dashed line marked with a ` 4 ' in figure  [ fig : gv ] ) .",
    "we start with a staircase type configuration @xmath81 and from this we can create four @xmath73-type configurations by assigning the value @xmath82 to @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 ( the factor @xmath57 arises because we extend the outer walks by a step _ and _ insert two new walks each containing a single step ) .",
    "the algorithm outlined above is already very efficient , but it can be further enhanced by the following simple observation . if we wish to calculate the number of polygons up to a given maximal half - perimeter length @xmath88 , we need not consider all possible gaps since some configurations can only lead to polygons of a size exceeding @xmath88 .",
    "first of all since gaps only increase or decrease by one at each iteration we need never consider configurations with gaps exceeding @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , any @xmath73-type configuration with @xmath75 must have half - perimeter at least @xmath90 .",
    "here we get the contribution @xmath35 from the outermost walks ( @xmath35 is the number of forward steps or iterations taken ) and the contribution @xmath54 from the innermost walks ( a gap @xmath54 requires at least @xmath54 steps ) . in order to produce an imperfect staircase polygon",
    "we have to add at least @xmath91 additional steps ( we have to join both the two upper - most and two lower - most walks ) , so if @xmath92 we can discard this configuration . not only can we thus discard some configurations when @xmath93 but we can also further decrease the memory use since rather than storing @xmath88 terms per configuration we only need to store @xmath94 terms .",
    "we calculated the number of imperfect staircase polygons up to perimeter 520 .",
    "the integer coefficients become very large so the calculation was performed using modular arithmetic @xcite .",
    "this involves performing the calculation modulo various prime numbers @xmath95 and then reconstructing the full integer coefficients at the end .",
    "we used primes of the form @xmath96 , where @xmath97 are small positive integers , less than @xmath98 chosen so that @xmath95 is prime , and @xmath99 unless @xmath100 18 primes were needed to represent the coefficients correctly .",
    "the calculation for each prime used about 250 mb of memory and about 18 minutes of cpu time on a 2.8 ghz xeon processor .",
    "naturally we could have carried the calculation much further but as we shall demonstrate in the next section this more than sufficed to identify an exact differential equation satisfied by @xmath16 .",
    "in recent papers zenine _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the linear differential equations whose solutions give the 3- and 4-particle contributions @xmath101 and @xmath102 to the ising model susceptibility . in this paper",
    "we use their method to find a linear differential equation which has as a solution the generating function @xmath16 for three - choice polygons .",
    "we briefly outline the method here .",
    "let us assume we have a function @xmath103 with a singularity at @xmath104 .",
    "starting from a ( long ) series expansion for the function @xmath103 we look for a linear differential equation of order @xmath54 of the form    @xmath105    such that @xmath103 is a solution to this homogeneous linear differential equation , where the @xmath106 are polynomials . in order to make it as simple as possible we start by searching for a fuchsian @xcite equation .",
    "such equations have only regular singular points .",
    "there are several reasons for searching for a fuchsian equation , rather than a more general d - finite equation .",
    "computationally the fuchsian assumption simplifies the search for a solution .",
    "one may also argue , less precisely , that for `` sensible '' combinatorial models one would expect fuchsian equations , as irregular singular points are characterized by explosive , super - exponential behaviour .",
    "such behaviour is not normally characteristic of combinatorial problems .",
    "( the point at infinity may be an exception to this somewhat imprecise observation ) .",
    "one may also ask the question whether most of the problems in combinatorics with d - finite solutions have fuchsian solutions ? while we have not made an exhaustive study , we know of no counter - example to this suggestion .    from the general theory of fuchsian @xcite equations it follows that the degree of @xmath106 is at most @xmath107 where @xmath2 is the degree of @xmath108 . to simplify matters ( reduce the order of the unknown polynomials ) it is often advantageous to explicitly assume that the origin and @xmath109 are regular singular points and to set @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 is a polynomial of minimal degree having @xmath113 as a root ( in our case we have @xmath114 ) .",
    "@xmath115 could be generalised to include more regular singular points if some were known from other methods of analysis , but we have not found this to be advantageous .",
    "thus when searching for a solution of fuchsian type there are only two parameters : namely the order @xmath54 of the differential equation and the degree @xmath116 of the polynomial @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 be the degree of @xmath115 ( 2 in our case ) , then for given @xmath54 and @xmath116 there are @xmath119 unknown coefficients , where we have assumed without loss of generality that the leading order coefficient in @xmath120 is 1 .",
    "we can then search systematically for solutions by varying @xmath54 and @xmath116 . in this way we first found a solution with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , which required the determination of @xmath123 unknown coefficients .",
    "we have 260 terms in the half - perimeter series and thus have more than 50 additional terms with which to check the correctness of our solution .",
    "having found this conjectured solution we then turned the ode into a recurrence relation and used this to generate more series terms in order to search for a lower order fuchsian equation .",
    "the lowest order equation we found was eighth order and with @xmath124 , which requires the determination of @xmath125 unknown coefficients .",
    "thus from our original 260 term series we could not have found this @xmath126 order solution since we did not have enough terms to determine all the unknown coefficients in the ode .",
    "this raises the question as to whether perhaps there is an ode of lower order than 8 that generates the coefficients ?",
    "the short answer to this is no .",
    "further study @xcite of our differential operator revealed that it can be factorised .",
    "in fact we found a factorization into three first - order linear operators , a second order and a third order .",
    "the generating function is a solution of the @xmath126 order operator , not of any of the smaller factors .",
    "so the ( half)-perimeter generating function @xmath16 for three - choice polygons is conjectured to be a solution of the linear differential equation of order 8    @xmath127    with    @xmath128    where @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , are polynomials of degree 25 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 33 , 32 , 29 , 29 , and 29 , respectively .",
    "the polynomials are listed in appendix  a ( note that the polynomials do not factorise ) .",
    "the singular points of the differential equation are given by the roots of @xmath133 .",
    "one can easily check that all the singularities ( including @xmath134 ) are _ regular singular points _",
    "so equation ( [ eq : tcfde ] ) is indeed of the fuchsian type .",
    "it is thus possible , using the method of frobenius , to obtain from the indicial equation the critical exponents at the singular points .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : tcexp ] .",
    ".[tab : tcexp ] critical exponents for the regular singular points of the fuchsian differential equation satisfied by @xmath16 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for equations of the fuchsian type the critical exponents satisfy a simple fuchsian summation relation , which we now take the opportunity to confirm in our case .",
    "let @xmath135 be the regular singular points of a fuchsian type equation of order @xmath54 and @xmath136 @xmath137 the @xmath54 exponents determined from the roots of the indicial equation for each regular singular point , @xmath138 , then the following fuchsian relation holds : @xmath139 in this case the number of regular singular points is @xmath140 , namely the 25 roots of @xmath129 , the two roots of @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath134 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the fuchsian relation is satisfied with @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and all the exponents @xmath147 summing to 868 , which is a useful check on our results .",
    "we shall now consider the local solutions of the differential equation around each singularity . recall that in general it is known @xcite that if the indicial equation yields @xmath35 critical exponents which differ by an integer , then the local solutions _ may _ contain logarithmic terms up to @xmath148 .",
    "however , for the fuchsian equation ( [ eq : tcfde ] ) _ only _ multiple roots of the indicial equation give rise to logarithmic terms in the local solution around a given singularity , so that a root of multiplicity @xmath35 gives rise to logarithmic term up to @xmath148 .    in particular",
    "this means that near any of the 25 roots of @xmath129 the local solutions have no logarithmic terms and the solutions are thus _ analytic _ since all the exponents are positive integers .",
    "the roots of @xmath129 are thus _ apparent singularities",
    "_ @xcite of the fuchsian equation ( [ eq : tcfde ] ) .",
    "there are methods for distinguishing real and apparent singularities ( see , e.g , @xcite  45 ) and in principle one should check that the roots of @xmath129 satisfy the conditions for being apparent singularities .",
    "however , this theoretical method is quite cumbersome .",
    "an easier numerical way to see that the roots of @xmath129 must be apparent singularities is as follows .",
    "we already found a 10th order fuchsian equation for which the polynomial @xmath149 was of a form similar to @xmath133 as listed in equation ( [ eq : tcpol ] ) , but with the degree of @xmath150 being only 7 .",
    "that is all the singularities as tabulated in table  [ tab : tcexp ] also appear in this higher order equation with the exception of the 25 roots of @xmath129 ( at most 7 of these could appear in the order 10 fuchsian equation ) .",
    "in fact we can find a solution of order 14 of the same form as above but with @xmath151 being just a constant .",
    "so at this order none of the roots of @xmath129 appear . clearly any real singularity of the system can not be made to vanish and we conclude that the 25 roots of @xmath129 must indeed be apparent singularities .",
    "assuming that only repeated roots give rise to logarithmic terms , and thus that a sequence of positive integers give rise to _",
    "terms , then near the physical critical point @xmath152 we expect the singular behaviour @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are analytic in the neighbourhood of @xmath113",
    ". note that the terms associated with the exponents @xmath156 and @xmath157 become part of the analytic correction to the @xmath158 term . near the singularity on the negative @xmath18-axis , @xmath159 we expect the singular behaviour @xmath160 where again @xmath161 is analytic near @xmath162 .",
    "we expect similar behaviour near the pair of singularities @xmath163 , and finally at the roots of @xmath141 we expect the behaviour @xmath164 .",
    "next we turn our attention to the asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients of @xmath16 . to standardise our analysis",
    ", we assume that the critical point is at 1 .",
    "the growth constant of staircase and imperfect staircase polygons is 4 , so we normalise the series by considering a new series with coefficients @xmath165 , defined by @xmath166 thus the generating function we study is @xmath167 . from equations ( [ eq : xc ] ) and ( [ eq : xm ] ) it follows that the asymptotic form of the coefficients is @xmath168{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{r}}}(y ) = r_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{i \\ge 0 } \\left(\\frac{a_i\\log{n } + b_i}{n^i } + ( -1)^n\\left ( \\frac{c_i}{n^{7+i } } \\right ) \\right ) + { \\rm o}(\\lambda^{-n}).\\ ] ] the last term includes the effect of other singularities , further from the origin than the dominant singularities .",
    "these will decay exponentially since @xmath169 in the scaled variable @xmath170 .    using the recurrence relations for @xmath6 ( derived from the ode ) it is easy and fast to generate many more terms @xmath165 .",
    "we generated the first 100000 terms and saved them as floats with 500 digit accuracy ( this calculation took less than 15 minutes ) .",
    "with such a long series it is possible to obtain accurate numerical estimates of the first 20 amplitudes @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 for @xmath174 with precision of more than 100 digits for the dominant amplitudes , shrinking to 1020 digits for the the case when @xmath175 or @xmath176 in making these estimates we have ignored the exponentially decaying term , which is the last term in eq.([eq : xm ] ) . in this way we confirmed an earlier conjecture @xcite that @xmath177 where we have taken into account the different normalisation , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "we also find that @xmath178 and @xmath179 , though we have not been able to identify @xmath180 .",
    "however , we have successfully identified further sub - dominant amplitudes , and find @xmath181 @xmath182 and @xmath183 and @xmath184 @xmath185 and @xmath186 it seems possible that the amplitudes @xmath187 and @xmath188 are rational .    estimates for the amplitudes were obtained by fitting @xmath165 to the form given above using an increasing number of amplitudes . ` experimentally ' we find we need about the same total number of terms at @xmath113 and @xmath189 .",
    "so in the fits we used the terms with amplitudes @xmath171 , and @xmath172 , @xmath190 and @xmath173 , @xmath191 . going only to @xmath192 with the @xmath173 amplitudes results in much poorer convergence and going beyond @xmath193 leads to no improvement . for a given @xmath194 we thus have to estimate @xmath195 unknown amplitudes .",
    "so we use the last @xmath195 terms @xmath165 with @xmath2 ranging from 100000 to @xmath196 and solve the resulting @xmath195 system of linear equations .",
    "we find that the amplitudes are fairly stable up to around @xmath197 .",
    "we observed this by doing the calculation with @xmath198 and @xmath199 and then looking at the difference in the amplitude estimates . for @xmath200 and @xmath180 the difference is less than @xmath201 , while for @xmath202 the difference is less than @xmath203 . each time we increase the amplitude index by 1 we loose around @xmath204 in accuracy .",
    "with @xmath205 the differences are respectively around @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "the excellent convergence is solid evidence ( though naturally not a proof ) that the assumptions leading to equation  ( [ eq : asymp ] ) are correct .",
    "further evidence was obtained as follows .",
    "we can add extra terms to the asymptotic form and check what happens to the amplitudes of the new terms .",
    "if the amplitudes are very small it is highly likely that the terms are not truly present ( if the calculation could be done exactly these amplitudes would be zero ) .",
    "one possibility is that our assumption about integer exponents leading only to analytic terms is incorrect . to test this we fitted to the form @xmath208 (",
    "as above , in making these estimates we have ignored the exponentially decaying term , which is the last term in the above equation . ) with @xmath198 we found that the amplitudes @xmath209 and @xmath210 of the terms @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively , were less than @xmath213 , while the amplitudes @xmath214 and @xmath215 were less than @xmath216 .",
    "we think we can safely say that all the additional terms we just added are _ not _ present .",
    "we found similar results if we added terms like @xmath217 or additional @xmath218 terms at @xmath219 .",
    "that is , we found that those terms were not present .",
    "so this fitting procedure provides convincing evidence that the asymptotic form ( [ eq : asymp ] ) , and thus the assumption leading to this formula , is correct .",
    "we have developed an improved algorithm for enumerating three choice polygons .",
    "the extended series , coupled with a search program that assumes the solution is a _ fuchsian _",
    "ode , enabled us to discover the underlying ode , which was of @xmath220 order .",
    "we did this without using more than 50 of the coefficients that we had generated .",
